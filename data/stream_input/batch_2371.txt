B001ER4CNY|5.0|For me, having the complete series of I dream of Jeannie has turned my life more amusing. Watching  an episode of I dream of Jeannie every night gives me much pleasure. I never get tired of it. On the contrary,  if for any reason I couldn´t watch at least one episode, I feel like something is missing inside me.I adore Jeannie and Mayor Nelson. I´m also a fan of Barbara for her spectacular character as Jeannie.My dream is to know Barbara face to face one day.I hope some day my dream will come true.
B003VDZK8K|5.0|This is my favorite A7 disc mainly because Mike Portnoy kicks ass all over the disc. His playing is so good it reminds me often of God (read: Neil Peart)
B004ZNB12O|5.0|The cd arrived very quickly, much sooner than indicated, in perfect physical condition. When opened and you can enjoy listening high quality in product development and the sound played.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Sinatra live for only 5.00 should be a crime. This man and his vocal styling will live forever! Take a lesson anyone who seriously wants to learn how to sing and more importantly interpret a lyric.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|World at Arms is a great game. A lot of fun with impressive graphics and good story to keep you interested
B0011Z7ILM|5.0|I know what to expect out of a A7 disc and this one certainly did not disappoint. Not as good as Nightmare but a great disc and worthy of the catalog to be sure!
B000W93CHC|4.0|I would recommend all these books.  Favorite authors. Books are enjoyable and exciting .  People who enjoy science and mysters<br />would like these boods

B003FSTN7A|5.0|We followed this series on TV, but missed a lot of these due to work.  We wanted to see the whole series. Lt
B0045EA1P6|5.0|They remind me of Queen so often on the Some Nights disc but I found myself getting distracted by the BASS BOOM BASS, I do not care for that in my music. Well in this release they do not fall victims to that sound and the result makes for a pleasant listen. I do not like it as much as Some Nights but I like it a lot.
B00BI745AA|3.0|The cinematography was superb, the production values were first rate, the acting was, for the most part, very good (Russell Crowe being the glaring exception), but the director's decision to use this particular cast to sing these songs is an abomination. What was he thinking? Is he tone deaf?, Or, does he just hate the musical and this was his way of getting back at it. While Amanda Seyfried as Cossette, Eddie Redmayne as Marius and Samantha Barks as Eponine did credible jobs on their songs, it could not make up for the awful caterwauling of Crowe, Jackman and Hathaway. I'm only giving it three stars because my wife said I was being too harsh giving only two. I disagree, but sometimes discretion is the better part of valor, and she is, after all, my wife and I love her.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|I do not like Justin's new cd Believe. I feel they have altered his voice so much on that recording that it sounds inhuman and far too overproduced to shove it down the throat of the Beliebers who really don't care how he sings as long as he takes his shirt off. Well, I am not of that generation (by a LONGSHOT!) I actually liked this cd which I obviously bought for my teenager. Here Justin reminds me of Cat Stevens, James Taylor and the great singer songwriters of the 70's. In fact if no one told me it was Justin Bieber I never would have guessed it. His mature voice unencumbered by all the electronica is actually quite pleasant to listen to. Great job Justin and from watching him on SNL I think I can safely say that he GETS it. To be able to laugh at himself with some self deprecating humor was great fun to watch.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have not seen the movie that has had so much critical acclaim, but I'm sure the book has to be better!<br /><br />This book is a truly amazing read. Mental illness is not a subject that I would normally seek out, but the book was much more than that. The story starts with the main character, Pat, coming home from a mental hospital where he has spent the better part of four years. The story is an unfolding of Pat's life prior to, during, and after his stay in the hospital. It is clear immediately he has an abusive father, a co-dependent mother and brother, and a young woman who understands him better than anyone else in his life.<br /><br />Pat is the eternal hopeful optimist who is a faithful believer in God and clouds with silver linings. Hope springs eternal in his belief in the Eagles, his ex-wife, and a life with a happy-ever-after ending.  The is no doubt in his mind that miracles occur in spite of life's reality. While life will never be what he hopes it will be, it is much better than he could have written the movie with the happy ending. This is a story of incredible sadness and incredible joy. Well worth every minute you spend on each page. Do read this book!
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I love this game especially because things actually move to block your path. You also get to go through a portal. The only problem is there's only one character, oz.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|So so so so so so so so so fun great .I am 9 and  love this game and you should totally get this game hope this review was helpful
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|There were moments of greatness and moments of sadness.  We saw many of the characters we had met throughout the series and saw their fates.  Overall, I enjoyed this book and I'm mostly satisfied.  Some issues hint at potential change (like the Seanchan/slavery issue), but are left to the readers imagination.  Some deaths affected me more than I would have thought, no spoilers, but it was Olver's companion
B00AESN8XY|5.0|A lot of fun to play!!! Very challenging, and kind of frightening if you really think about it. Cant wait for the new updates really looking forward to the future updates!!!
B00AKFG15S|3.0|I find it a bit tiresome to have this particular series all ending on a cliff-hanger. NOt Archer's best effort. I would not recommend this book

0783230079|5.0|Why can't Hollywood make movies like this anymore? No sex or machine guns. Not even an explosion. Just a good story and great acting. This is a movie you will want to watch from time to time. Good to add this to your collection.
B00908DDZM|4.0|I didnt fall in love with this album right away. But after listening to it a few times i can definetly understand what the hype is about. Macklemore writes whats real. In a generation where all hip-hop seems to be about is strippers, money and p**$y... Macklemore keeps it real (and sometimes funny)! And People respect that. I do. I recommend \\"The Heist\\" to annyone who supports \\"REAL RAP\\".

0393061310|5.0|Jared Diamond has written a phenomenally explanative piece of science and literature. Guns, Germs, and Steel (GGS) is expansive, elaborate, immensely detailed, and very convincing. It is also necessary reading for anyone seeking to understand the overall flow of history better or why there is such political and economic disparity between nations and continents.<br /><br />His book begins with the conflict between Francisco Pizzaro (Spanish conquistador) and Atahuallpa (emperor of the Incans), and he works throughout the book to explain why fewer than 200 soldiers were able to overthrow an empire spanning the entire length of South America. He accomplishes this goal quite handily and by the end of his treatise, the reader is left with a broad understanding of how geography, ethno biology, plant and animal domestication, linguistics, and technology all worked to shape the course of human history.<br /><br />----<br />First, Diamond tracks the spread of hunter-gatherer homo sapiens from Africa all the way to Hawaii (AD 500) and the tip of South America (around 10,000BC). From there he looks at where and why food production occurred. Because of the Fertile Crescent's diverse eco system and geography, a huge number of plant species arose that happened to be capable of domestication. The most important of these were wheat and barley, which are high in protein and easy to farm (compared to corn, the staple crop of Meso-America).<br /><br />The beginning of food production in Western Europe and the Fertile Crescent (about 11,000 BC) was accompanied later by the domestication of large mammals (of over 100 large mammalian species only about 14 have been successfully domesticated, the bulk of them found in Western Eurasia and SE Asia). This domestication of cattle, oxen, horses, etc (combined with the accompanying sedentary lifestyle brought on by food production) allowed for the spread and eventual immunity of Europeans to a multitude of diseases. There was a `shorter distance' between one host to the next, compared to hunter-gatherer societies, which continued to be on the move and thus were disconnected from domesticated animals and their own human feces.<br /><br />Thus, those societies of the Old World developed immunities to deadly diseases, which they carried with them to the New World. For the hunter-gatherer tribes and bands, as well as the newly constructed empires, there was no defense against these microbes and their populations were decimated (from about 20 million to 1 million shortly following the arrival of Columbus). With few exceptions, the flow of infection went from Europeans to Natives, Old World to New World.<br /><br />The food production and animal domestication occurring in the Old World was accompanied by greater populations and eventually the formations of states (as opposed to tribes, bands, or chiefdoms). The New World also had states by the time of European arrival, but they were still lagging technologically (they had a `late start' you might say), were hampered by the lack of large domesticable mammals (with the exception of the llama and alpaca) and found language and technology spread more slowly due to the geographical and environmental barriers they faced (animals, plants, linguistics, and technology all flowed much more smoothly across Eurasia due to fewer geographic barriers and it's relative latitudinal continuity).<br /><br />The fact that it was Europeans and not Chinese that first explored the New World is attributed to the political fragmentation of Europe as opposed to the generally homogenous and politically unified China. Oddly, this fragmentation worked to assist, not hamper European inventiveness and eventual exploration. Despite China's technological superiority in the 1400's, the decisions of a few politicians could greatly limit exploration and innovation. Columbus was able to propose his voyage to the Indies to four different nations. China's explorers, by contrast,  could only proposetheir ideas to one government and would have little in the way of options if their idea was dismissed.<br /><br />---<br />Aside from the flow of the book, the most important thing to be aware of before picking up GGS is that it is a dense work. It spans thousands of years and crisscrosses the globe on almost every page, requiring the reader to pay close attention. Constant comparisons are being made between civilizations, regions, ethnicities, cultures, etc. over different time periods and ages.<br /><br />Also, I would argue that for the lay-person to truly absorb what professor Diamond has put forward, they would need to reflect and move more slowly than they might normally when reading a piece of non-fiction. This is because it covers so many different fields (biology, anthropology, nutrition, linguistics, history, and geography) that most readers will enter into at least ONE field that they are unfamiliar with or find uninteresting. For me, I was forced to admit throughout the book the overwhelming impact of diet and domesticable plants and animals; fields that I don't find myself naturally inclined to study.<br /><br />GGS has been criticized at times for its organization or unnecessarily dense and exhaustive examples. I would agree that much of the reading is dry, however the overall thesis, interspersed with historical events and personal tales keep the 'plot' moving forward quickly enough to hold the attention of the reader. Diamond is not a phenomenal writer, but when his narrative and explanations are compared to the anthropology texts read in most college courses, it is a breeze.<br /><br />In short, I highly recommend this dense but worthwhile book. I found it wonderfully instructive and informative. I would read it critically and supplement it with the National Geographic documentary that was based on his work (you'll have to suffer through his truly bizarre accent, but it summarizes many of the main points).Though many have critiqued his theory as being too simplistic, I found it to be an overwhelmingly convincing work. I finished the book with (I believe) a greater understanding of how and why the world functions as it does.<br /><br />What more can you ask for?
B008JFUO36|2.0|Here is Tom Cruise's latest movie in a single sentence: It's \\"WALL-E\\" with a heavy dose of \\"Moon\\" and \\"Total Recall,\\" and a touch of \\"The Matrix\\" and/or \\"Terminator.\\"<br /><br />If you've seen these movies -- and most other sci-fi from the last thirty years -- \\"Oblivion\\" will seem oddly familiar. Admittedly, being derivative isn't necessarily a death blow to a movie. But being dull and spiritless is -- and while director Joseph Kosinski crafts a truly beautiful, brilliant post-apocalyptic world to play in, he never crafts a story or characters half as interesting.<br /><br />Sixty years ago, an alien invasion was repelled... but not before they destroyed the moon... which seems to have just made Earth temporarily inhospitable rather than permanently lifeless. The human race has evacuated to Titan, and the only ones left are a \\"clean-up crew\\" who live in an iHouse high in the clouds, and use drones to exterminate the alien \\"scavs.\\"<br /><br />WALL-E... sorry, I mean Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is regularly sent out to repair drones, but he's more interested in the ruined remnants of human civilization. But one day he finds cryo-pods from a crashed ship, and barely manages to save one of the survivors, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) -- whom he recognizes from half-recalled memories.<br /><br />While trying to help her out, Jack stumbles across a small band of surviving humans, led by Beech (Morgan Freeman) -- and he finds that they are planning to blow up the TET, a human space station. When Jack refuses, Beech sends him off on a quest to discover the truth rather than... well, just telling him what's going on.<br /><br />Joseph Kosinski has only done two movies, but he's already developing a distinct style: bland story and gorgeous visuals. \\"Oblivion\\" is a truly beautiful movie, with sweeping views of an Earth that has been completely devastated, but is slowly being reclaimed by nature. The only oasis is the cold, sterile iHouse, set in a perpetually rosy cloudbank atop a slender pillar. It leaves you thinking that Kosinski has dreamed up designs for the entire planet, and just wants to tour his postapocalyptic world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot is a Frankenstein's monster of other sci-fi movies. Almost everything in this movie has been done better elsewhere, either directly ripping it off (\\"Moon\\") or in cliche form (oh dearie me, what IS the connection between Julia and Jack?). And there's no passion or energy behind anything that happens -- it all feels bland and generic.<br /><br />And Kosinski is just awful at expositing anything that ISN'T ripped off from those other movies. Major plot twists flew directly over my head because of how blandly they were revealed -- for example, the big reveal involving the TET.<br /><br />Sadly the characters are just as bland and generic as the story. Tom Cruise is basically playing the Generic Tom Cruise Action Hero here -- a good, morally-upright guy who has some murky stuff in his past. Even the character's NAME sounds like a GTCAH name. Cruise gives a decent performance, but he's definitely not stepping outside his action-hero box -- and the character is so blandly nondescript he probably couldn't even if he wanted to.<br /><br />None of these characters have pasts, quirks, other relationships, or anything to really flesh them out -- they're as blandly uninteresting as the plot.. Kurylenko is pretty awful, Freeman is phoning it in, and Melissa Leo and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau aren't given enough to do. The only really good performance is Andrea Riseborough as Harper's lover/partner, who is made pretty miserable by his attraction to Julia. But alas, she also is not given much to do, and is gotten rid of when she becomes inconvenient.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" is a visually entrancing movie, but the Frankenstein plot left me feeling empty and bored. Directed by someone other than Kosinski, it might have been an astounding film... but instead we just get a bland, forgettable one.er pillar.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game its like subway sitters but its with a car anyway I looked at the video and I definitely. wanted this game so bad.
B00AQKEPMI|2.0|First of all the 3D effects in this movie were very disappointing,they were few and far between as have many of the other 3D movies recently released.The storyline while cute wouldn't hold a child for longer than 15 minutes.I was looking at the clock after the first 20 minutes.Save your money and get the regular version or better yet skip it til it comes on cable.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  Haven't gotten through it yet, but it's very thought-provoking and enlightening.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. I don't know why. It just feels right. It's a good time waster. I love the shapes and colors.
1400067820|5.0|There are few books that totally blow the mind.  This is one of them.  This book was recommended to me by my friend Greg Tidwell.  Probably, only someone as smart as he is has the ability to totally understand this text.  It is a hard read, and deals with deep and complex stuff.  But it is so worth it, it really causes you to think, and it is a book that will cause you to really reflect on life.  The book deals with the principles of antifragile.  Just quickly, what is the opposite of fragile?  Often people will say, resilient, but this is not the case.  Being antifragile is the ability to become stronger with force added.  It does not break, rather it is strengthened with force.  This basic idea is explored in various dynamics and situations in life.  The book is deep and complex, and is a lovely read.  This book will help you think through life, and there will be a ton of information that will help you in life.  This is one of the best books ever.  I highly recommend it.  If you are looking for a long, complex, and deep read, this is it.  Trust me, this is a homerun read, and I still still at night thinking through it.
B003YCI1PM|4.0|Great cd
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|I was expecting this was going to be more of a horror film rather than a disturbing thriller. It had a solid plot but could have been about 15 mins shorter. I am a big fan of horror films, but this movie really didn't hit the mark in the horror aspect. It still had me wondering what was going to happen next, but not much more. If you are looking for a disturbing thriller this is it, but if you have come for a scary horror film, this will disappoint you. If you are still curious regardless, see the film because it wasn't a bad film,just nothing you are expecting.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|To tell you the truth I was a little disappointed when I first heard \\"suit and tie\\" I did not like it...at all. But like \\"sexy back\\" it grew on me. I now love it. One of my favorite songs on the cd actually. But my most favorite song on this cd is \\"Pusher Love Girl\\"<br />This song is amazing. EIt and Mirrors are the reason I still love Justin after all these years. He has this sound to his voice. He is my Frank Sinatra. He always comes out with something different and amazing. And this is a reason after all these years he is at the top of the freakin' charts.
B000A2UBN4|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I have watched this over and over.<br />Got tired of waiting for it to come on TV.  Now I can view whenever I want.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|By buying this watch, I still could not get close, grab my hands. But he really surprised me!! It's beautiful, showy and impressive detail. The INVICTA is to be congratulated for this watch! I am satisfied and have no negative points to highlight.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|Assuming you've seen the movie before, there's no reason to summarize it.<br /><br />So, let's talk about this Blu-Ray Edition.<br /><br />It's uncommonly sharp, and adds new glory to the backgrounds and overall creep-factor of the Stanley (Overlook) Hotel, and Jack Nicholson? Looks like he' s slowly going nuts right in your living room.<br /><br />One of the sharpest transfers I've seen!
B0062OZRPQ|5.0|I love this DVD. You will like it . You get very good quality audio and video. great collection for everyone

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I ordered the nostromo and g13 because I was having a hard time comparing the two so I just got them both fully understanding I would lose 10 on restocking. I am pretty happy with that decision. The nostromo came first and I tried extremely hard to love the product but all other cons aside it was just too uncomfortable to use and a product like this that just cant be overlooked.<br /><br />Then comes the  G13 and daaaaamn so much better its way more comfortable (for me at least) has more keys , which although I don't use all of them I can configure which ones i do use to match where my fingers rest so thats a huge comfort plus(also the &#34;replacement&#34; wasd keys have divets on all of them making locating them easy), it has an analog joystick (not the bs d pad) which you should probably be using for movement in games (one thumb makes more sense over 3 fingers) which just allows more options for your hands/abilities, It does have an lcd (pretty lame really but it's there) and it is larger than expected but build quality is pretty great better than the razer plus the keys are quieter which means they aren't mechanical but I despise loud keys so for me that is a plus.<br /><br />Honestly I don't play a ton of &#34;hardcore&#34; games but for what i do play it has worked great making it much more comfortable to use it even mashed well with the rts/fps games. The truly awe inspiring aspect is that for people like me who use rev it sketchup design builder it is a godsend. From some informal tests it makes them so much faster about 20% for me and thats still being mildly unfamiliar with it, and even 20% on a 30 hr project can really make a difference.<br />In conclusion its just great and I would spend the money again. If its G13 v Nostromo get the G13 justify it how you want (lcd,analog,more keys) but I found it was just more comfortable.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow, I could not put this down. Excellently written and researched (especially all the technical stuff) and a resourceful, and very funny main character. Mark Whatney McGyvers himself believably out of everything that Mars throws at him.<br />Loved this one and can't wait for whatever the author is up to next...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This music is AWESOME beyond words! My 16 year old son found this on the internet and now we are all addicted! This is even MORE fun to watch and listen to at the same time, but this is becoming one of my new favorites and so fun to listen to! Very energizing and puts my family in a great mood!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|easy to use, big buttons and lots of functions, love the scientific notation and trig functions, rotating to simple calculator is quick and easy.
B00003A9QI|5.0|LOVE this MUSIC!!!!  This is some of the prettiest music I have ever heard. Hauntingly beautiful and relaxing. My son got this for Christmas....from me, so that I could enjoy it!  ;o)
B001DM1VXE|5.0|If math is the language of all things existent, then it's formidably built as a spiral with spirals.  The mystification of golden rectangles and Fibonacci numbers combined with the evil of greed and the basis of an entire religion will surely cause you to question if there truly is a single key to all that is.  If you found it, would you sacrilegiously unlock things or throw it away for inner peace?  Your toil and struggle could end with as simple a decision as Max makes, faced with intensifying polarization until the very end.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|After all these years I still love this movie...saw it when I was 10 years old and adored it! The old movies aren't ALL great ones, but this one is exceptional if you like musicals.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It wouldn't be Christmas without Dickens! We read him every year without fail. We also watch the many film versions of Christmas Carol. A big contribution to our cultural literacy! A must read.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I love this guys incredible voice....so mellow and romantic! My 17 year old daughter fell in love with this and now the whole family is into Michael Buble'!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This movie is a classic, but...it comes alive in Blu-Ray. You will feel as you are there in every way. You feel as if you could swim in the lake, climb the tree's (and of course the mountain), feel the thunder and rain. It is choice. Loved this movie all over again.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|A MUST see if you love &#34;Bonnet Movies&#34; as much as I do....I LOVE Jane Eyre! This is a very well done movie in every possible way. This is my favorite of the Jane Eyre movies!
B0014JKJJI|4.0|very light and comfortable, fit as expected but i may have misjudged the size.  i wear a regular &#34;normal&#34; shoe size of 9.5 to 10 but i ordered this one as a size 9.  my middle toe kind of rubs against the inside front part of the clogs but it is not that uncomfortable.  if i had to, i would order again with a bigger size in length.  i work in a very busy restaurant in the kitchen section and i stand for 8 hours with a one hour break in between and this shoe just fits the bill.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love play this game it really addictive too I recommend this game to all age groups my niece are happy with this game
0618918248|1.0|I can sum the whole book up in one sentence. \\"I don't believe in God because I don't like him or Christians.\\" The book has nothing to do with scientifically proving atheism all it is, is a big soap box that he calls evidence to prove he right, all based on emotions and feelings.  Also I love how he named off all these tragedies that religion has committed, but failed to acknowledge Joseph Stalin and his murdering of 20 Million people with an atheistic view driving his motives. Maybe that's why he would never debate William Lane Craig.<br /><br />I didn't finish the book. My niece turned on Dora The Explore and I found it more interesting than this piece of complaints I mean work sorry....
B009MYAQK4|5.0|I am always so blown away by how eloquent and beautifully written Paulo's books are. This book didn't disappoint either. I just finished the book and I'm so excited to reread it again. This story was so well written with powerful message in every paragraph. A must read.

B003V5CFV8|5.0|Wow! A friend had brought this DVD over for us to watch and it wouldn't work about 1/2 way though.  This is not the kind of movie I would pick, but it was so good that I wanted to see the rest and so I rented it! So worth it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such a great book! One of my favorites. Positive, uplifting, honest, real. I highly recommend it. Wow this review requires a lot of word
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a great story and lots of ups and downs, but through it all I could not stop reading.  I have also read the follow up book and loved it as well.<br /><br />I picked this book based on other readers' reviews on Goodreads.  Many of the people who like the same type of books rated this with 4-5 stars.<br /><br />I recommend this to people who like the romance books.  It is not like 50 Shades of Grey, but if you liked that book you will probably like this.  It does not have the detailed sex (or much sex) like 50 Shades, but it has the ups and downs of a relationship similar to that type book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. I play everyday I'm so addicted to it. This is the best bingo game that I have played.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I bought one of these in 2011, still use it and works great.  I got a new one 4 years later and its a little updated.  It sounded worse and broke fast.  They ruined this great mic!
1600595871|5.0|This will be an excellent help to answer questions, and find solutions, as I work on binding my homemade book creations.  I'm a beginner so exposure to a variety of ways it can be done should be helpful.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I bought this for my husband,. He has always been a Hendrix fan. He was very happy with this new release.
B006J420UE|4.0|This is a very good and fast product used with Windows 7 64 bit operating system. I don't play a lot of fancy games so I don't test its graphics capability to the max, but Windows 7 rates the graphics as only 5.9, the slow point in my system. Even so, I have no complaints and I'm not about to spend three figures on a fancy graphics board.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I absolutely. loved this game. I've always been into hidden object gamws but the puzzles on this. game along with everything else is fantastic.
0316056898|5.0|Bossypants, a memoir by Tina Fey, was an uplifting book that incorporated Tina Fey's wit and humor into one book.  The memoir goes trough Fey's life, beginning as a toddler and ending around the time of her early forties.  Through this time, she discusses to the readers on the struggles and obstacles she faced throughout her life.  She stresses to the reader that although one may go through many difficulties throughout her life but that shapes a character into a better-developed person.  Overall, Tina Fey finds the drive for having an occupation she loves, not just for the money.  I particularly liked this idea that the passion for the job was more important than the money earned from it.  Fey also empowers readers to live their life to the fullest and realize that even if life begins a little rocky (like hers),  it requires YOUR motivation and YOUR determination and nobody can do it for you.  Not only was this memoir empowering and motivational, it also was humorous and Fey tells many funny childhood stories of her childhood to reinforce to the readers that although her life in the early stages was rough, she turned out okay.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone in 9th grade and older for its profane language and complex humor.  This book is a feel good, laugh out loud memoir I was so happy to have read!
1250012570|4.0|By now, you've probably read about Eleanor & Park or at least heard about the book. It's made waves all across the blogosphere... So my friend and I decided to read this one together, and I decided I would share my email to her with you all because... hell, maybe you're still curious or debating whether to read this one. But debate no more: read it! Love it! Enjoy :).<br /><br />\\"That book.<br /><br />This book.<br /><br />Now I know why everyone was saying it broke their hearts.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />I know you don't like spoilers, so I'm really hoping you're only reading this if you've finished...<br /><br />...but the plot twist?<br /><br />Wow. So unexpected. And so powerful. And so *insert spoiler here*<br /><br />Okay, so originally I thought, hmm, this book feels a bit long. I'm not overly fond of the high school narrative and while I liked that Park / Eleanor had complicated school dynamics and that they didn't really like each other at the start - which lent a lot to the realism - I thought the book was slow. But it didn't matter that it was slow, because the writing, while simplistic, is so beautiful. I love that she switched from their perspectives, even for small lines to cement whether Eleanor / Park did X and X, falling in line with our expectation. And I counted. 15 pages have been ear-marked. So many quotes. So many beautiful descriptions. You know what it really reminds me of? Gayle Forman's work, which makes sense because she blurbed the front. But there's this underlying truth in the narrative that I've felt mostly with Forman's work. John Green has a bit of that, but his seems much more explicit with all the metaphors he throws around.<br /><br />Such a simple premise but so well executed.<br /><br />I loved that both of their families had both happy and terrible moments, because then it was less of type-casting, you know? Although I am a bit undecided as to how I feel on some of the characters... Some stereotypes were explored but disowned(i.e. cultural portrayal of Asian men as asexual) while others were just kind of left there (i.e. Eleanor's friends; my friends would probably not be pleased with DeNice and Beebi's portrayals).<br /><br />On a different but related note, I loved that Eleanor is big. That sounds strange to say, but I've noticed that a lot of the girls with larger bodies either seem to be useless sidekick or a bully. It's a prevalent stereotype in middle-grade fiction, for sure. Percy Jackson -> Clarice. In Bridge to Terabithia, I forgot what her name was... Janice? Those two examples come immediately to mind, but there's a lot more... And anyway, I think that being slim is considered a part of the \\"default.\\" (White, Christian protag. unless otherwise specified.) And I think that having someone like Eleanor contributes to diversity in a different way than is usually discussed.<br /><br />I also don't usually love full-out descriptions of the characters, but I loved them here... They were so Eleanor, so Park. And they were so integral to that feeling. As John Green wrote, what it's like to be young and in love. And so without the usual cynicism. There is some cynicism, but mostly there is hope. And goodness.<br /><br />This book.<br /><br />Okay, I will stop now.\\"
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Truly a wonderful movie.<br />It was a great price, and came quickly and in great shape. Ordering it through Prime was a good idea.
1451648537|5.0|Clearly written account of the life of a genius. Not necessarily the most pleasant man at times but what a life, what a contribution when looked at overall.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Great action packed movie. Robert Downey, Jr. is awesome. Story line was easy to follow. Special effects are really cool.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Quite idea for a small twist on the lawyer theme.  Grisham is always an easy read that keeps you interested.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great Vince Flynn book.  Ready for the next one and hope it is soon. Please keep them coming if possible.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I loved it. I have been watching PLL on ABC Family from the beginning. So, the book is not totally the show but, I LOVE the book and intend on reading the rest of them.
B005LAIII0|5.0|For me, this movie was realistic enough not to brush off, and fantastic enough to set my imagination aflame. The visual effects were positively Avatar-like, although I have seen neither in 3-D, only Blu-ray. Even with that limitation on my part, \\"Life of Pi\\" was a cinematic work of art. Also, the story is a great one. As with \\"Slumdog Millionaire,\\" it focuses on a young Indian man in a seemingly impossible situation. Suffice to say, adversity grows the soul. But that is where any similarity with \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" ends. My best advice is to give this movie a chance and experience its best qualities. It may not change your life, but it can brighten your day. Enjoy! Fr. Dennis
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Could be worse. At least no vampires or werewolves in the hero role. Not like I am going to be camped out for the next in the series.
B009AMANH4|5.0|What a gift to be honored with a glimpse into the life of Abraham Lincoln, one of America's most revered leaders, and rightly so. Some may argue that this movie is hagiography and a white wash, but IMHO, no way! The burden of proof falls on the naysayers. Don't get me wrong, \\"Lincoln\\" is not perfect. There is the goof up on the 13th Amendment vote (for the abolition of slavery in the U.S. and territories) in the U.S. House of Representatives by the Connecticut delegation. The movie says two \\"no\\" votes and the historical record says none. All of CT's representatives voted \\"yes,\\" as clarified by CT's 2nd District congressman Joe Courtney.    Yes, I believe this movie got it right by portraying Lincoln as extremely likable, even lovable. True, his enemies hated and reviled him, mainly perhaps because his humble openness reflected their mean-spirited selfishness and bigotry back on them. Lincoln was often a man of his times, as betrayed by some of his opinions regarding African Americans, but he also could transcend those times. I've often wondered if someone as backwoodsy as Lincoln could ever get elected today, kind of like someone from \\"Duck Dynasty\\" being elected president in 2016. Now I am convinced that yes, he could -- and would. \\"Honest Abe\\" would stand out even more so today than he did 150 years ago, and his homespun humor and storytelling would resonate in the 21st century. Add to that Lincoln's warmth and empathy, and you have someone who truly \\"belongs to the ages.\\"    Day-Lewis' Lincoln seemed very realistic. Here we see a man who would swear and pound his fist when angry, but who also showed that greatness of soul forged in the crucible of war. Before seeing \\"Lincoln,\\" I wondered if Sally Field was too old to play Lincoln's wife Mary. After seeing it, I realized that both Lincoln and his wife had become prematurely old by 1865. As General Grant observed in the film, Lincoln aged ten years between 1864 and 1865. The last photographs of Lincoln bear this out. Tragedy ages a person who really cares for others.    Regarding the importance of the slavery issue, again I feel this movie got it right. Slavery wasn't everything, but it was the main thing. The states' rights dispute was based on economics, and the Confederate economy thrived on cheap and always accessible labor. Doing away with slavery would force an unwanted paradigm shift down the South's throat. Today, slavery is unthinkable, but then it was not. The movie \\"Lincoln\\" helps us to understand that a little better. All in all, a great movie with several minor flaws, none of which threaten a five star rating. In addition to Sally Field's fine effort and Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens, David Strathairn was brilliant as Secretary of State William H. Seward, a wannabe co-president who helped sharpen Lincoln as only another iron will could do. With that said, I am at a loss as to why \\"Lincoln,\\" after twelve Academy Award nominations, received only two Oscars. Fr. Dennis
B009KEN87O|5.0|good game..easy to get through but still a challenge...reminds me of the games we used to play in the eighties
B0043X1FOK|5.0|This is a hilarious funny movie for all ages.  And it kept in time with the first sequel.  I loved it and couldn't stop laughing.  JOHNNY FIVE is sure ALIVE!  It's a great movie to watch.  Price was great too.  And the quality on the DVD is superb
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is great! I love to play it. Sometimes I get booted out of a room, but that does not seem to happen on my kindle fire, only on my PC.<br /><br />Update to prior review- Buffalo support did NOTHING to help with a problem I had for not receiving my credits I purchased, but never received. Thanks to AMAZON's Customer Service, they were able to resolve my issue. Thanks AMAZON!
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|These DVD's were comparable in price and the movie was great.  If you're keeping up with all sagas' of the Twilight fans.  DVDs played great.  Would highly recommend supplier and product.
B00BVVA138|3.0|Not sure I like the singer in this album. Seems like some of the songs are not as well composed as previous albums from KSE. Still good. Just different.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Was a good flick.  The English sub was good, did not distract me from the body of the film, or the actress.
1451627289|5.0|I got this book for my dad for Christmas, because he's such a history buff and very much a Kennedy fan. He really enjoyed it. I read it after he finished and I was amazed at the story-telling that King presents. He's quite a talented and detailed writer. This was the first King book I've ever read, and I was thoroughly amazed by it. It is intense, sad, gripping, and terrifying all at the same time.
B006IVBSBU|4.0|I expected something more from this movie, I think. I wasn't disappointed per se, but it just feels like there was something missing. It was very well done, though it was a little boring in places. It represents well what would/might happen if something like this was to happen in the real world. I recommend to everyone, because this movie shows human nature at it's core. No one is immune.
B009POHHR6|4.0|I have been a superman fan for years but this is an awesome comic even if you have never read superman before
B003VBNN7C|5.0|I've seen this movie countless times and own it on dvd. Most movies after a few watches gets old, but this one doesn't. It's great. A classic. I highly recommend for anyone who likes music, dance, or just good movies about rising from the dust and overcoming obstacles. A five star movie all around.
B000FA675C|2.0|worst history ever, but is a great read. the &#34;facts&#34; are not facts at all, and are made up, but structured in a way that convinces you.  its a page turner
B004X75RK4|5.0|I've seen this movie multiple times. Though I've been disappointed by a lot of Sandra Bullock's movies, this one is by far her best in a while. It's hilarious and I suggest it to anyone who likes a good laugh and doesn't mind a little romance thrown in there.
1449433251|5.0|I like Calvin and Hobbes and I am very happy with this collection, it has high quality in images, in very complete and has several pages of history in the first book.
B000N90JGI|4.0|A great movie overall, but it seems a little slow at times, I think. It's good though, so watch it if you like movies by either of the main actors.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very fun and creative game. It is addicting and very understanding and simple to play. Anyone could play with ease! Keep up the good work! :)
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|Silly movie- bought for a child as gift - we have it and our child watches it over and over and over....
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game, but I would rather get items by earning them through successful game  play, rather than by asking friends or buying them with real money.  I kept running out of  diamonds and realized you need them to progress in the game.  I kept being told that if I posted my progress on Twitter I would get more diamonds, so I joined Twitter specifically for the diamonds.  No help.  The free diamonds was as one shot deal.  Not liking that!
B00280LYHS|5.0|If you have not read the first ones, read them. This is an awesome series and this is the last book. You NEED to read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really fun game. I think it is better than temple run because in this game you get to go on top of trains and you have moving obstacles
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story line and many twists to keep you entertained.  The actors are superb and I have enjoyed the settings..
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am very happy I bought the series for my Kindle.  These are long books so it is nice to have them available to tote anywhere on my Kindle.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My 28 month old love this app and has started counting along with the voiceover.  My only complaint is that you have to hit 'next' after you complete each and every exercise.  My toddler doesn't understand a 'next' button. :)  I wish it would automatically switch to the next screen once you complete the exercise.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Played this game on my friends phone. i didnt quite get it at first, but when i did, i was hooked
006441034X|5.0|I read this book at least once a year, if not more.  It's movie is also amazing, but can not be compared to the book. Both hold their own candle and should not be treated the same.<br /><br />They are, at the barest minimum, the same story.  But most everything after that has changed, from names, to ages, to personalities and plot!!<br /><br />As is usually the case, I like the book better, Howel is sweeter and more down to earth, and I understand Sophie MUCH more.  But then again, Christian Bael has a very sexy voice..<br /><br />Anyway, Book, GREAT, read it.  Now.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My friends were all talking about the series and i decided i wanted to read them. there was a great deal at the time when i bought the books. I LOVE them. They get you hooked and you can't stop reading. I have read the series at least 5 times now. One of the best series i have EVER read!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The narrator made the book. It would have been a tedious read as a lot of math. It kept me reading with the narration. I am not a  space person and took a chance. Glad I did.  Follow the journey with Mark. His upbeat attitude made me think anything is possible. Read this book.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Night Visions is one of my favorite things to listen to. I first heard the song Radioactive in a movie trailer, and bwhen I searched for it in kindle music, Night Visions came up and when I listened to a sample of beach song, I bought the album, and now it is one of my favorite things to listen to when I have nothing to do.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I had read this one in print years ago but I must have been in an inattentive mood as I had missed much.  The story made more sense the second time around.  I was made curious by the vague references to the past history of the world in which this story takes place.  Would have liked to hear more about that.  Also, the second time through the story (1st read was years before this one), I felt like I had missed the ending for I didn't remember it the same way that I read it the second time.
0316067598|5.0|It was a great book about bravery and courage, I would say this should be on your must read list.
B001974DG0|5.0|This one and &#34;Midnight&#34; are my favorite Dean Koontz stories.  Disappointed to see that &#34;Midnight&#34; is not available on Kindel from Amazon.  Just the audio book version ... bummer !
0399160450|5.0|It was a typical Clancy- Jack Ryan series book. You start reading and lose all track of time. It kept me interested enough that in 3 days it was done leaving me wanting more!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It had an amazing amount of words that i didn't know and almost every one i wanted to know more about.
0920668372|1.0|This book is terrible.  I don't understand why this was published.  It is good only as a gag gift for new parents you don't really like.  I think if you buy it with Mein Kampf, you get free shipping.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I so far have only the free one, but, it isn't much different. I love the weather gadget, tells me what I need to wear to school, the alarm gets me up for school on time. I also love how the clock does not have to be set... its already on there so no hassle. ir has worked for about a month now so I know my stuff. - Enyssa 14 years old
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I watched it the day it came in the mail, loved it, and can't wait until the next one comes out. I am so eager, I am more than willing to go out and buy the books in order to &#34;get ahead&#34; of the movies, and know whats going to happen just to get through the suspense of it all.
0670026603|5.0|Finally, a book worthy of its high rating. Definitely the best book I have read in a long time, maybe ever. The characters were all believable and the story was beautifully told. My heart ached for Will and Lou, I tear up thinking about this book. What a wonderful treat.
067144901X|4.0|it is a board book.. few words, decent drawings, fun language.  enough said.  used copy of poorer quality than i expected
B00BFBSV72|5.0|Great and easy game to play and fun for adults and kids alike!  I would definitely recommend to family and friends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the first one... I was not expecting anything that happened at the end! The whole plan was amazing and it shocked me that the head gamemaker was in on it, can't wait too read the third one!
B008VO3PA4|4.0|Hilarious, but too short! So much cat truth in pithy verse.  Anyone who loves (or hates) cats will love this book.
B008JOLG7U|4.0|This goes back to the Block time with the beat sounding almost the same, but with a little more edge.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|This is the only album I have by these guys.  I found the music to be very mellow and polished.  Mostly I listen to it softly in the background if I'm reading or working on my laptop.  Sorry I can't give you a comparison to their other work.
B005K17RU0|5.0|For the most in accurate weather forcast, this is what you are looking for! You have to try it to love it.
B008220C38|2.0|This film was not our type of film. We haven't watched it entirely yet as we got bored with it soon after starting it. We plan to try again some time.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I loved how this book was written<br />Captivating, couldn't put it down<br />I would recommend it to all of my friends
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|Too violent. We may try to watch it again at a later date. I realize it is depicting something that may be close to reality but we just were not in the mood for the blood and guts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy to read and interesting<br />found I wanted to read all the book<br />Would recommend it to all my friends
B0061Q13V2|5.0|this was an easy read and very informational into the life of a gymnastic favorite.  it really opened my eyes to how corrupt the world of gymnastics is.  i hope it changes and more gymnasts speak up.
0857520652|4.0|It took me a while to get into this, but by the end of the story, I was a fan. I would recommend it without hesitation.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|UPDATE (6/14/2013):  Refrain from buying the single 3D-disc version, because you have the option of purchasing the 3D disc for $5.99 on DisneyRewards.com with the combo pack. I discovered this when I went online to get the digital copy with my combo pack. It is for a limited time though, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />WARNING: ***SPOILER ALERT*** Some things discussed in this review could potentially spoil some of the film for those who have not yet seen it.  Therefore, if you have not seen it, read onward at your own choice.<br /><br />Okay, first thing is first: This review is NOT about the packaging decisions made by Disney for this set or their decision to sell the 3D version separately.  I agree with most that it is corporate greed and is quite despicable, but that is not what I am here to review because most everyone can come to that conclusion themselves without people ranting about it endlessly in the reviews.  No, this review is an actual critique of the film, so if you are here to get a sense of whether the film's (and thus this set's) actual content is something you're interested in, this review is for you.  Naturally, I saw the film in theaters and am writing this review based upon my viewing of the film and observations made during that viewing.  I shall attempt to go over the positives and negatives associated with the film in a fair way that can allow others who have not yet seen the film to draw their own conclusions from hopefully.<br /><br />Before I get into specifics, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize that, given the material the film is coming from and the ENORMOUS shadow it had to work in from the 1939 film, one should not judge this film overly harshly.  I think we all know that no Oz film is going to ever fully eclipse the much-beloved and universally cherished 1939 film with Judy Garland and Margaret Hamilton.  Hence, to even try to overcome such a monumental production is a fool's errand, but so too is the idea of judgingany new effort to reboot the Oz saga by comparison to the 1939 film alone.  I myself have been a lifelong lover of the 1939 film, ever since I was a small child, and it remains one of the most beloved movies in my collection to this day.  I came into this film knowing going in that it would not likely overcome the sheer splendor and magic of the 1939 film, but I also came into it with an open mind and a curiosity to see how they could potentially bring the Oz story into the 21st century.  This is how I would suggest all who have not seen it yet to go into it: go in with an open mind and with no preconceptions about the film as best you can.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1) BRIDGING IDEAS FROM THE 1939 FILM WITH IDEAS FROM THE BOOKS:  This film did an excellent job of paying homage to the original 1939 film in several ways (i.e. scenes in Kansas were in black and white while Oz was in full color, hints at Dorothy Gale's heritage and eventual coming, the presence and familial relation of the Wicked Witch of the West and the Wicked Witch of the East, foreshadowing the Wicked Witch of the West's weakness to water, the classic green-skin variation of the Wicked Witch of the West's look made popular by Margaret Hamilton, Glinda's use of bubbles for transportation, foreshadowing the presence of Dorothy Gale's three friends in Oz, the Wizard's illusions that allowed him to use a projection of his head to speak with authority, etc.) while also addressing several things that were absent from the 1939 film and yet present in the original novels (i.e. Dainty China Country, mentioning of the former King of Oz, Quadlings, Winkies, etc.)<br /><br />2) ACTING:  This is something that cuts both ways, as some actors/actresses were well-suited to their roles going in, while others clearly needed some time to grow into their roles.  Examples of the former include Mila Kunis and Rachel Weiz, who give absolutely stunning performances as the Wicked Witch of the West (Theodora) and the Wicked Witch of the East (Evanora) respectively.  I must take my hat off to Mila Kunis especially, who had HUGE shoes to fill in taking on the role of Theodora, the eventual Wicked Witch of the West, a role which had previously been immortalized by the performance of Margaret Hamilton in the 1939 classic.  Kunis put a stupendous modern spin on the character while also paying homage to the foundations for the character that were laid by Margaret Hamilton more than 70 years ago, portraying Theodora in a way many girls like her today could empathize with initially while eventually transitioning her into the classic green-skinned Wicked Witch of the West we all know so well.  The same goes for Weiz, who finally gives screen-viewers some insight into the character of the Wicked Witch of the East.  She is portrayed as the elder and quite deceitful sister of Theodora who was adviser to and later murdered the last King of Oz so as to take control of Oz herself while framing his daughter, Glinda the Good Witch of the South, for the crime.  Both delivered compelling performances that left me wanting to see more of them in the films to come, as did Michelle Williams, who also gave an outstanding performance as the Good Witch Glinda as well as her counterpart in Kansas, Annie, who is foreshadowed to be the mother of Dorothy Gale.  I suppose the biggest test any actor or actress faces in portraying a character is leaving the viewer with the desire to see more of them in films to come, and I can definitely say these three more than cleared that bar definitely.<br /><br />3) VISUALS: This film WOWED me with the visuals and bright colors shown throughout the film.  Just as its great predecessor did before it, the film showed the contrast between black and white filming with colorized scenery, and the result couldn't have been more appealing.  The bright colors and scenery of the Land of Oz nearly jump right out of the screen at you, and the effect will likely have kids oooing and ahhing over it for sure.  The picture quality is simply amazing (see the China Girl for a prime example of this).<br /><br />4) CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:  While some may disagree with this, as an Oz enthusiast for over 25 years, I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the character development over the course of the film.  Some of the biggest and most well-done examples of character development in the film are that of Oscar Diggs (the Wizard) and Theodora (the Wicked Witch of the West).  The film does a good job of showing the Wizard's transition from a petty con-man to the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz we were introduced to in the 1939 film.  For example, we are shown that Oscar was originally a womanizing con-man and illusionist that had a dubious set of ethical standards.  Over the course of the film, we see him mature and learn from his mistakes and their consequences (the hard way in some cases i.e. the transformation of Theodora).  The other biggest example lies with the character of Theodora herself.  We are shown the HUGE contrast with how she was originally compared to the version of her we are all most familiar with.  In the beginning, we are shown she is a compassionate, beautiful young witch who has the best interests of Oz at heart.  Having fallen in love with the Wizard upon his arrival in Oz, Theodora's heart is broken when her sister deceives her and convinces her that he has tried to court all of the three primary witches in Oz.  It is at this moment of utter heartbreak that Theodora's tears leave burning scars on her face (foreshadowing her weakness to water that would one day be exploited by Dorothy Gale) and she is deceived into eating a green apple that her sister promises will remove all her heartache.  This is however proven to be a deception, as the apple's effects cause Theodora's heart to rot and die, eventually disintegrating altogether.  As a result, her face is distorted and her skin is turned a bright shade of green.  Donning her now all-black attire including a black pointed hat, she assumes her new identity as the Wicked Witch of the West.  Mila Kunis delivers a stunning performance to bring this character development to life for us, and it is a real treat to behold.  These are just a couple of examples of the good character development over the course of the film.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1) ACTING:  As stated above, this cuts both ways.  While the bulk of the cast did outstanding, I will say there is one example where this was lacking in particular.  That rested with the titular character (Oscar Diggs) and its actor (James Franco).  There were times throughout the film that one could tell Franco was perhaps not the best choice to portray the role of the Wizard.  Some examples include over-the-top moments of dialogue (\\"Zim-zala-bim! Begone coward!  Fear my greatness!\\") and his at times awkward moments in the role.  However, I do feel that by the end of the film, Franco had found his stride and was finally comfortable in the role, especially by the time of the film's climax in the battle for control of the Emerald City.  The biggest times I noticed this awkwardness/woodenness was earlier in the film, and it is true that initially I felt that perhaps another actor may have been better suited to the role of the Wizard.  But by the end, I do feel Franco has grown comfortable and competent enough to continue in the role and perfect his handle on the character.<br /><br />2) LACK OF A CENTRAL MORAL TO THE STORY:  Whereas there was a clear lesson we learned alongside Dorothy during her experience in the Land of Oz depicted in the 1939 classic, it wasn't as clear in this film that there was a central moral to be learned from the story.  Whereas Dorothy learned to appreciate and cherish what she already possessed in life, it is unclear what moral Oscar was to learn from his initial experience in Oz.  I suppose we may learn that even though some of us may not feel important or powerful, our own personal strengths can make up the difference if we put our minds to it.  Beyond that, I was left wondering what we as an audience were supposed to learn from Oscar's experience.  It is clear he became a better man and finally learned from his mistakes in the end, but the overall lesson he was to learn was not entirely clear.<br /><br />3) USE OF STRENGTHS:  One of the biggest gripes I had with the film was not in what it lacked, but in what it did possess but which it did not use enough in my estimation.  A very big example of this was with the character of Theodora.  While we are given a decent amount of screen time to get acquainted with her in her original form as Theodora The Good, we are not given nearly as much time to see her in her classical form of the Wicked Witch of the West.  Mila Kunis gave such a wonderful performance as Theodora, and yet when she was at her best and clearly having the most fun with the role (that of her wicked form), we were not given nearly as much screen time to see her fully in action.  While Evanora and Glinda have their face-off, Theodora simply flees the city to the West on her recently-acquired broomstick.  While it is clear we will see them all again including the Wicked Witch of the West, I still wish they would have given her more screen time to further demonstrate her effectiveness in the role of the witch.  This was not the only example of this, but you get the picture.<br /><br />4) OVER-RELIANCE UPON CGI:  One thing that the 1939 classic proved was that it is possible to be highly compelling and visually stunning without Computer Generated Imagery.  While the special effects in the film were quite attractive to the eye, there were times (especially over the course of the Wizard's journey through Oz) that it bordered upon overkill.  The beauty of the 1939 classic was that we didn't have to have a lot of fancy special effects from computers to make us fall in love with the film.  Not that all computer-generated effects are bad, infact many genuinely did add to the visual beauty of the film.  It is just a small complaint when they seemed a little over the top, such as when the Wizard was swept into the twister and transported by it to Oz.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  This was an excellent opening overall to a promising reboot of the Oz saga.  As I noted in the beginning, no Oz-related film is ever going to fully eclipse the 1939 classic in the hearts and minds of the American public.  However, considering the immense shadow cast over the film by the 1939 film, this film did a much better job than some would expect in measuring up in terms of quality and substance.  It is easy to judge this film and others related to the Land of Oz by the standards of the 1939 classic, but that can at times seem a bit unfair, considering how monumental the earlier film is.  If some are always looking for the perfection of the 1939 classic in every Oz-related film, I am afraid they will almost always be disappointed.  If one can come into this with an open mind however, it is a HUGE treat indeed overall.  For those that have not seen the film and are on the fence about it, I STRONGLY encourage you to give this film a shot.  It puts a wonderful modern spin on Baum's classic stories, and that is something that is definitely to be celebrated.  I am sure especially that somewhere, Margaret Hamilton is likely smiling about the new take on the character which caused her to be immortalized in cinema history.

I was very satisfied with with my blu ray purchase as a replacement for my dvd copy.<br />This looks like a fake review due to it's short length. It isn't though I promise. Read my other reviews as proof. I am awesome and sincere and would never write a fake review! Unless i was paid. Which i wasn't! But I would have taken money to write the same review.....<br />Really though, this movie is always amazing and on blu ray it's even better.

B0030MM68O|3.0|I watched this movie because I was curious to see how the director dealt with the subject and I was also interested in seeing Jeremy Renner in a role other than that of a Super Hero.  Although this kind of movie is not the type I usual watch, I have to admit that I was impressed with how the director and actors portrayed the tension of being in a war zone.  Very well done, for the subject.

B0029ZA3H4|4.0|When you're working for yourself and doing your own thing, sometimes you need a pick me up. I certainly feel like I always need some inspiration to help me keep going. This book did exactly that for me. It was a boost. I wasn't expecting it to be the ultimate manual on all things social media and entrepreneurship. I wasn't expecting to get a lot of tactical &#34;to do's&#34;. What I did get was a challenge to pursue your passion (assuming you know what it is), and a recipe for success (assuming you are willing to hustle and work your tail off) in an entertaining, easy to read and inspiring manner. I enjoyed his style, his story, his enthusiasm and his ability to put himself out there regardless of what other people say or think.

0743243153|1.0|I had a copy (1978 copyright) lying around and having never actually read the entire thing (as far as I can remember) I approached it with enthusiasm that I was finally going to get the benefit of its wisdom. Haha. Even when I was able to get beyond the dated references to \\"long-hair\\" and \\"passive homosexual\\" it just seemed like one big HUMBLEBRAG - a term which didn't exist when this book was written. I'm absolutely no authority on spirituality, theology or psychotherapy but I agree with another reviewer who did not miss the obvious conclusion that Scott Peck believed himself to be godlike in his ability to \\"love\\" and reparent his patients to wholeness and spiritual growth. Since he's no longer around and I've never read/heard any commentary he may have made on his book so many years after its initial publication, I will generously believe that he would now be embarrassed by its tone and much of its message.<br /><br />If you like reading self-help books but don't look for them to really change your life, then go ahead and have a look. Fun play as you read - keep track of how often he uses the term \\"one\\" when referring to people. What-ho, I say!!!
B007L24T52|4.0|The book is good for people who'd read other baldacci books, as I was able to predict a bit what was going to come at end but still was curious to read it till end.

B001C1066E|3.0|I love Naruto, and when I seen this coin purse....I had to have it! Although it's extremely disappointing that it doesn't have the googly eyes as shown in the photo. I had to take off 2 stars because of the misleading picture.<br /><br />Other than that, its pretty cool. At first it looks as though it can't hold much change at all, but as you keep stuffing it in there, the actual frog stuffing pushes in and it begins to hold a whole lot! You just have to keep pushing in the coins and then letting it sit that way for a while.<br /><br />It makes me wish that all money was in the form of coins....so I could just walk around with this and toss out my wallet!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am an avid ebook reader.  I find myself downloading new books almost daily.  I found this book while searching for highly reviewed, lower-priced books and gave it a try.  I'm sure glad I did and I'm sure happy to see that there is more available from this author.  I would recommend it to anyone.  While I guess the subject matter would be classified as dystopian fiction, the struggles of the characters come across as very real; without the usual disconnect of time and place that is characteristic in most examples of that type of fiction.

B005LAII8A|5.0|In my eyes, Rian Johnson is one of the finest visionaries of his generation.  Soon to be an auteur (or maybe he already is one), his directorial style is undeniable and his ability to completely soak into his films is remarkable.  His films stand out as his own.  He knows how to drape himself over every frame, and all three of his feature films are noteworthy in their depth as well as style.<br /><br />`Looper' is probably his finest film to date.<br /><br />Science fiction films are a dime a dozen these days, and they usually center around the same themes and regurgitated effects, and that's what makes `Looper' so engaging; it feels fresh and exciting.  Loopers are hired guns who make executions for the Mob.  In the future, when the Mob wants to off someone, they send them 30 years into the past and have them disposed of by these loopers.  At times these loops are closed.  This happens when the looper himself gets sent back to be killed by his past self.  When this happens the looper, after killing himself, is given the next thirty years to squander his money in debauchery, knowing that he'll be dead at the end of it all.  Sometimes, the looper has a change of heart and goes AWOL, refusing to kill himself.  In this case, Joe's future self is just too much for him to handle.<br /><br />With a backstory that unwinds in the most unexpected way, `Looper' is marvelously written and expertly directed by Johnson.  He shows such grasp of themes and style, melding the science fiction aspects of the film with black comedy, sheer impact of action, minimalist romance and moral ambiguities that keep the audience completely soaked into every frame.  The action segments are insanely inspired, especially the final blowout, and the performances by the entire cast (Emily Blunt being best in show) propel this film in the right direction.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a clever take on a tired genre.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this Silo Saga to be extremely entertaining.  I fell in love with each and every one of the characters...even felt like I'd known them all of my life.<br />I got the book because it was cheap....not much of a title or book cover.  I'm still not exactly sure what the title means...but I certainly did love the book.  At times it was so exciting I couldn't read fast enough.<br />I can't wait to read mote from Hugh Howey.
B0099114WO|4.0|There is something almost sad about the way in which `Hope Springs' is received as a comedy.  I mean, while watching the film I couldn't help but smile and or chuckle uncomfortably in certain spots, but the film truly is NOT a comedy or even really all that funny when viewed in the context of the film and so there is something tonally off about our willingness as a society to view this as a comedy based solely on the fact that the main protagonists are an old couple.  Seriously, watch the same movie with some young actors like Anne Hathaway and Joel Edgerton and you'd have a very serious and somewhat heartbreaking film.<br /><br />Instead, we laugh.<br /><br />`Hope Springs' tells the story of Kay and Arnold.  Their children are grown and out of the house and their relationship has dissolved into a puddle of mundane and they suffer through routine and engage each other nearly NONE of the time.  Kay is fed up and wants a real relationship, with talking and sex.  Arnold is not interested.  He's content with the way things are.  That's when Kay throws counseling in his face and basically says \\"I'm going with or without you, but without you means this marriage is over\\" and so Arnold begrudgingly gets on the plane.  Next thing you know they are sitting in front of Steve Carell and spilling their guts (or at least Kay is) and he's giving them exercises that Arnold is hesitant to perform.  He doesn't even want to hold her hand.<br /><br />The concept of the film and even the overall handling of it are truly dramatic in tone and rich with so much meaning and yet they are bogged down by this preconceived notion that `old people making love = comedic gold'.  I don't understand this idea and yet I fall victim to it myself.  The scene in the hotel room when they are getting passionate on the floor would have been seen as hot if actors twenty years younger were cast in the part.  Instead, we as an audience are reduced to chuckling like prepubescent children who heard someone say the word \\"wiener\\".<br /><br />It's silly and disheartening.<br /><br />Still, my uncontrollable reaction and all, this film is far more engaging and speaks to a deeper place than I expected.  Streep and Jones are wonderful here, each playing off one another with so much heart and soul.  Jones is especially effective as the stone hearted gruff who learns to let his guard down (sort of).  I highly recommend this film, and I recommend you watch it twice, that way you can get over the shock of it all and then watch it with clean eyes and an open mind.the word \\"wiener\\".<br /><br />It's silly and disheartening.<br /><br />Still, my uncontrollable reaction and all, this film is far more engaging and speaks to a deeper place than I expected.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Can't believe it got cancelled! Had the potential to STILL be on the air 11 years later in my opinion. My review is just buy it. LOL. I'll lanch into a rant about how awesome the show was, how stupid Fox is for their stupidity, and how I wish we'd get a Serenity sequel or a continuation of the show that's not in comic book form, so I'll stop before I get started...
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|A good read! Adventurous, exciting, and in depth. The only downside is that it is culturally exclusive and neglect to refer to any other impact from the 80's besides from a white-suburban perspective....it's seems to be missing something. But still a good read.

0425252868|5.0|A HIGHER CALL showcases a singular engagement between a Luftwaffe fighter and an 8th Air Force B-17 in December 1943. The Luftwaffe pilot in his Bf 109 had the crippled B-17 dead to rights but chose not to finish off the Flying Fort because he was a compassionate human being. Author Adam Makos uses that atypical encounter as the centerpiece of his A HIGHER CALL book, which is really the before-and-after lifestories of the two pilots involved - Franz Stigler and Charlie Brown. Air war buffs will want to pick up a copy of this  2012 Berkley Caliber release; it's a winner.<br /><br />Since some 740 other reviewers have already weighed in on A HIGHER CALL, there really isn't much left to say.  Makos' extensive interviews with both pilots and fellow aircrew produced a level of detail and intimacy seldom seen in air war books. Likewise, those interviews helped produce a rare, warts-and-all history of a rank-and-file Jadgflieger at war.<br /><br />Aside from the lack of an index - which the book really needed - A HIGHER CALL is an excellent piece of writing. I think it's safe to say that Makos' appealing, affecting book will become an aviation classic...and deservedly so. Highly recommended.

B003XKNE7U|4.0|I like Austen.  I like Austen a lot.  I admire her observations on society, I revel in her plot revelations, I tingle in pleasure at her turns of phrase.  I particularly am in awe of her abilities in irony.<br /><br />All of that is present in this book - and yet you, dear reader, have already sensed that I suffer reservations in recommending this book - and this is true, yet I assure you my reservations are all for irrelevant reasons.<br /><br />1st, having read a number of her other works, the simple predictability of Austen and the genre in general began to leak through.  In a way Austen is a victim of her own success, so we know where her story is going.  (Spoiler alert!! Girl gave up boy for silly societal reasons - what will now happen?  Will he forgive?  Does he love another? All will be revealed, lessons learned, and hearts broken, mended!)I don't mean to be overly hard on her - it's a wonderful book, it's just that it does the same things that P&P did, but not (to my taste) quite so well.<br /><br />2nd, upon finishing this book, I immediately took up Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, and it was as though I had been listening to Beethoven on a single-speaker crappy boombox, and suddenly the symphony snapped into surround-sound.  I know I shouldn't compare one author with another - indeed, it's probably unfair to compare anyone to Tolstoy - but going from one to the other really did set up the juxtaposition in my mind, and it wasn't in Austen's favor.<br /><br />It's a good book - and Austen is always her own type of greatness.  And if you are in the mood for another dose of Austen, and have read Pride and Prejudice already, by all means.  But if you are looking for an absolute jaw-dropping encounter with a master of literature, I'd look toward Tolstoy instead.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved this series.  Each book starts with a bang, then they are a bit slow.  However, make sure you have time to read the last 1/3 of the book in one sitting.

B0072GPPNC|5.0|A wonderful movie for all animal lovers.  Extremely touching. Gives proof as to how smart our 4 legged friends are.Excellent Movie !!!!!!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Simply amazing. I laughed, cried and was enlightened. I would definitely recommend this book to any and everyone. I learned a ton of interesting tidbits to make my life more pleasurable.
B001D09OAI|5.0|Great cast and plot<br />Some of the greatest movie quotes and a great look inside the trash talk that goes on inside a game<br /><br />&#34;I hate that f***ing song&#34;
B000QDA7OU|4.0|I watched this movie reluctantly after reading some other reviews and am so glad I did! It was quite riveting and was based on a true story. Audrey proves she is not just a one-trick pony and can do more than just romantic comedy; she nailed it without the fancy clothes, hair, and makeup. The ending was lackluster, but this is a must-see for Audrey fans.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Contains all the information and more I was looking for in a weather app and the big plus is it's free. Best weather app I've found and I've went through many. A must have.
B0099114WO|1.0|Really did not like at all. I have the impression that it is not a comedy, it is not drama, it's, for me, a no well mix of an intempt of both, with the inconvenient of the obvius great expectations that come from the two wonderful actors that are in it... definitly not a well outcome, really hate it!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thought this book dealt beautifully  with the broken bonds of love between parents and children. The struggle of learning to love and trust another human being  after the ultimate rejection of a parent. I found this book to be very touching and heart rending as we experienced the life of all the characters in this book who had painful issues, but in the end found healing and comfort through  found hope and found love
B00BJS7LHC|1.0|OF course they (Tarantino) didn't cast a dark-skinned black woman in the role as the wife - if they did they would have made a huge comment about how dark skinned black women still live in virtual slavery today.  Lets be clear Django's wife was not originally a house slave b/c she would not have been married to Django.  There was no need to cast a light skinned black woman in this role.  But, because Tarantino is merely a commercial director interested only Hollywood accolades, he went the Beyonce route for the character of Broom Hilda.  I for one am a white person who thinks it's about time black women are treated as beautiful.  Society needs to evolve and let black women be beautiful as they are with natural hair and natural skin.<br /><br />On a positive not Samuel L Jackson is masterful in his role..as good as he is Leonardo DiCapro is awful, awful awful.  The movie carries on far too long but, the cinematography is super.
B004CLYKLI|2.0|If you can imagine a 7-hour plane ride in which you're seated next to a shrill, drunk woman with an inflated ego and a full-blown case of Munchhausen's disease, then you have some idea of what this book is like.<br /><br />The book is an almost, but not quite, comedic farce.  It's not just the author's outrageous claims, (her three-year-old was reading Sartre and understanding the deeper concepts, too, no doubt) but also her complete lack of self-awareness.  She verbally abused her daughters, 'inspiring' them to be number one in *everything*, yet admitted to giving up tennis as an adult because, \\"the pressure of competition was too great\\".  Then there were her bizarre reasoning (she forced them to take piano and harp lessons because playing the drums leads to drugs.  Everyone knows that, duh.)  Even though Chua never learned how to play the violin, she studied books and watched the music tutors like a hawk so that she could stand over her children while they practiced and instruct them on how to do it right.  Finally, there is the constant complaining about American culture: Americans are too fat, too stupid, too lazy, and too provincial (and yet she never moved back to China...why?)<br /><br />The biggest laugh came when Chua realizes that the family dog, a Samoyed, was not ranked as the smartest breed in the world.  Determined to prove that *her* dog was better than all the other dogs, she drills the poor creature over and over again to make it behave perfectly (did I mention she was an expert dog trainer even though she'd only owned one dog in her entire life?)<br /><br />Chinese, British, Canadian, American...I've seen this kind of mom many times before.  I'm sure her kids *are* highly accomplished musicians (they should be - they were forced to practice at least three hours every day), but the reason they were successful was because their mother bullied everyone in her path.  No doubt those teachers and tutors gave Chua everything she wanted just to make her *shut up and go away already*!<br /><br />The saddest part of the book, to me, was when Chua's daughters make her birthday cards and Chua 'rejects' the cards, insults her daughters for not creating better cards, and rips up the cards they made for her.  I kept thinking that those pathetic cards were, in reality, true expressions of how those girls felt about her.  They didn't love her, so they made her crappy cards.<br /><br />I almost gave the book one star, but there was a glimmer of hope for the author by the end of the book.  I doubt she changed her beliefs (why would she?  After all, she's an expert on everything), but at least she changed her behavior.  A little bit.hut up and go away already*!<br /><br />The saddest part of the book, to me, was when Chua's daughters make her birthday cards and Chua 'rejects' the cards, insults her daughters for not creating better cards, and rips up the cards they made for her.

140053271X|5.0|Product shipped quickly, and arrived slightly ahead of schedule, even from the other side of out country.<br />The stated storage capacity is rather misleading. It says 2gb, but half of that seems reserved for the system, and most of what's left is reserved for B&N's ebooks. That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library.<br />Fortunately, a 4gb microSD card cost me a measly $5. Even better, memory card integration is seamless.<br />Amazon's got a great price, too. $10 cheaper than anyone else. Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.<br />One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86. It's a little weird, but not a major issue.<br />I got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is.<br />The last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device. You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files. However, it's irrelevant, since all of my ebooks are on the memory card, and I bought a USB adapter for that very reason.<br />All in all, this is a fantastic product, and I am very pleased with it.

B00338QENI|5.0|Loved it! I would recommend that everyone read this book and become familiar with a woman, we should all thank!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I have loved Fall Out Boy since I stumbled upon their first album in an old record shop, \\"Evening Out With Your Girlfriend\\". I continued to love them through all of their ups and downs. Infinity on High is my least favorite of their records - it felt less like FOB and more like a record they needed to release to keep their name out there. Don't get me wrong, there are a few great tracks on there but I don't listen to more than half that CD. Folie a Deux really blew my mind and brought them back for me - that's why I was so surprised that they went on a hiatus. I felt like they had found their vibe, found what made them love music. I was wrong. This is their best yet. I can't skip any track. the wonderful lyrics are back and they've grown up. They play their instruments like it is a part of them, Patrick's voice is always amazing and you can't help but rock along with each song. Each song brings something different and shows a new way that the band has grown. THese aren't the same boys from From Under The Cork Tree - these are men who are now a rock band that are ready to remind you why you fell in love with them in the first place. Welcome back, guys.
B008FPZQRO|2.0|Product not as advertised. Very disappointing.<br />Disc 2 CD is suppose to have 17 tracks. Disc 2 CD only had 10 Tracks.<br />And Disc 3 DVD is advertised that it has 32 tracks and reality it has only 10 tracks.<br />Looks like a case of bait and switch.
B005C9YZKU|4.0|Overall I'm VERY happy with this purchase.  The production, video quality and sound are all AMAZING, and has helped me truly learn new things about the planet we all share.  Blu Ray is the best way to go with this series, and it plays at a full 16x9 ratio, so there are no \\"black bars\\", and the video will occupy the entire screen of your TV.<br /><br />My only small criticism of the production is that sometimes, in the various segments, some of the video and audio, is used, almost verbatim, from one section to the other.  To the producers and production teams credit, they weave the material into a relevant area, and it's kind of seamless.<br />If you don't watch all of them back to back, you might not even notice, but it makes it just a little bit repetitive.<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this set.
B000063DFN|5.0|IRON MAIDEN is part of my life, and i think everyone who enjoys METAL enjoy songs like ACES HIGH, 2 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT, BACK IN THE VILLAGE and the title track POWERSLAVE!!!!TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!MAIDEN rules the METAL world!!!!!!YEAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0812993292|4.0|Harold Fry is a retired man living in a small town on the southern end of England called Kingsbridge. He and his wife Maureen have a strained marriage where currently they keep minimum contact to one another. The why is slowly explained throughout flashbacks.<br /><br />One morning, Harold receives a telegram from a woman he hasn't talked to in 20 years. This woman, Queenie, has written that she has cancer and is dying in a hospice. A stop at a burger shop on the way to the post office to deliver the reply brings an epiphany. Harold is seized by the words blithely uttered by the waitress that faith will save her. With these words burning in his mind, Harold spontaneously decides he will walk from his town to Berwick upon Tweed to keep her alive. Utterly unprepared, in yacht shoes, no camping or survival gear, what is only a few hours driving will take weeks by foot.<br /><br />It's beautifully written, and harkens to the time when men and women took to the road to seek penitence and enlightenment for past transgressions by talking pilgrimages to places of spiritual meaning. I also love the names of the English towns he stops at. The descriptions of the hills, the heathrow hedges, and the quietness that comes from abandoning faster means of transport instill a small yearning to simply walk out the door and keep going. As Harold walks these hills, he remembers his career at the brewery, his traumatic childhood, his dating and marriage to Maureen, and how everything intertwined to shaped his life. His ruminating on all the things he failed at makes Harold wonder if it's not too late to change himself. Is the book sad? Oh definitely. But it's also uplifting, reminding you that even if it seems hopeless, there's always optimism to be found if you only know take a moment to look.

0385421982|4.0|John Grisham is a master story teller, and doesn't disappoint in this gripping tale of the murder of two Supreme Court Justices and the young law student who figures out who did it. The movie that was made of the book isn't nearly as good.

0061251321|5.0|Both Shawn Kinkade's and Steven Savage's reviews give a solid portrayal of the book.<br /><br />It gives percentages of individuals working at each stage, citing that 48% of American professionals are in Stage 3, where they feel like they are lone warriors and are putting in more than they getting out.<br /><br />For fans of Dilbert & the movie Office Space, many references are made, easily creating humorous parallels that we can all relate to. Even makes a reference to the original Star Trek.<br /><br />As triads have been mentioned in previous reviews, here is an effective quote: \\"Coaching Tip:  How can triads solve your problems?  The central theme of this book is that you are only as smart and capable as your tribe, and that by upgrading your tribe, you multiply the results of your efforts.\\"<br /><br />Well worth the time spent.

B008Z9YGEE|4.0|This movie is a great movie if you haven't read the books or if you do not expect it to be very similar to the books. Sure the general theme's and main characters are there but they changed a lot of the little details that make the books so great. There were many little things that are introduced in the first book that have more meaning in later books but these details were changed in the movie meaning that subsequent movies will be missing the corresponding details which is disappointing. The movie is worth watching and I enjoyed the movie more the 2nd time I watched it because I did not have such high expectations for it.
B004GYY714|5.0|I listen to lot of talk radio shows and it is super easy to find them<br />- if you want to browse local radio stations, it is neatly categorized into AM and FM<br />- by genres<br />- search is most useful - just search your favorite show/host name \\"xxxxxxx\\" and out pops all radio stations nationwide who are broadcasting them. tap and listen away<br /><br />Wonderful app...
B008NR8YXC|2.0|I've listened to all of Schiff's (downloaded) Bach concertos, and think highly of most of them.  His WTC, as I've heard it on YouTube, is another matter.  Unless the recording and transmission are defective in some way I don't understand, the inner voices of these pieces have a way of beginning, then fading away.  It's important to emphasize the entrances of new contrapuntal lines, but their continuity must also be brought out.  This latter is annoyingly absent.  He brings your attention to an entrance, but then lets it fade into inaudibility.  I'm now looking elsewhere for my WTC listening.

1608955702|5.0|As a professional photographer, I need to know this stuff.  Every time I think I know something, Neil teaches me how much I don't know in his books.  I have two other of his books and I've seen him speak a number of times at various conferences and classes and I read his blog which I find very educational.  I learn from Neil's work, and I love how he educates.  Since Neil wrote this book and I'm a fan, I read this.  I knew I would learn something but wow, each section opened me up to new possibilities, things I wouldn't have thought of, things I want to try and 101 things I just didn't know.  He explains things in great detail, and shows photos of concepts he is illustrating.  The set-up photos are extremely helpful in understand how and why he does things a certain way.  And I like how he shows photos with various settings to show exactly how changing an element can drastically change the result of a photo. I'm very visual so reading it and then seeing it really helps me.  I also like the variety of photo subjects.  Since I'm not a wedding photographer, it would be uninteresting for me to see all photos of brides.  He shows models, brides, couples, and the style of the photos go from sweet and beautiful to edgy so you can learn how to approach your own style of photography through Neil's examples.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to people who want to broaden their minds to areas of photography they don't know, people who want to open their minds and approach things they already know in a different way, AND realize all the things you just missed along your photography journey that this book fills in.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Irish dialogue, there were some really funny sessions that made me laugh out loud.  Rose and her 'wisdom' and her many misquotes that still made a sort of sense.  What did not make sense yet I know it happened, still happens, is the extreme violent and cruelty against the most innocent, the children.  It will hurt your heart but everyone needs to be aware, otherwise how do you know what to look for and stop if it is within your power to do anything.<br />  The ending was absolutely wonderful and healing can begin in some very wounded souls.  This is definitely an author I want to read again, have already put her other books on my wish list.

1476733953|5.0|(*Vague spoilers, at worst*) One of the things that really made me want to give this book 6/5 stars is the underlying implications of human psychology and sociology. The silo in Wool displays a microcosm of twisted political ideals, from propagandizing to intentional sabotaging of individual freedoms to outright assassinations and cover-ups, all for the sake of a supposed \\"greater good.\\"<br /><br />A background debate of \\"protecting people from their own inevitable natures through deceit\\" versus \\"a transparent community will thrive on truth\\" is implied, but not shoved in the reader's face. Additionally, the post-apocalyptic setting in which this novel takes place is really interesting: a bleak, not too distant future made chilling by its believability and feasibility. The overall conversation and room for reflection this book creates makes it much more open and enjoyable than so many other novels in this post-apocalyptic genre.<br /><br />The characters are well-developed and enjoyable, though not ground-breakingly original, and the style of writing is clear, exciting, well-paced, and addictive. I cannot recommend this book enough. Thanks, Hugh Howey, for creating such an excellent story. I'll be purchasing the next volume as soon as I have a bit of spare money. :)
B00A85EMVK|5.0|The 3D is real good. Tom Cruise was facially tweaked to remove excess fat in his face. That has to be the case. Man it paid off. He looks better today 27 years after Top Gun was made. All the people who were in Top Gun back then are bald, fat, starting to wither up while Cruise is an eternal fountain of youth and vitality.<br /><br />Movie making is better now. It has evolved. The Jet plane footage is top notch stuff today. Watch planes go by all the time. The combat footage was excellent. It was more realistic than actual planes in the air.<br /><br />They are in uniform. Uniforms don't change.<br /><br />Maverick... Predictable. Corny too.Tom kicks ass. Gets the beauty. Tried and true. Not only that, the enemy was made out to be excellent pilots to good for anyone other handsome Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Have watched about 40 minutes. Not in the mood for a movie at this point.<br /><br />Want the fat excess in my face removed but am afraid of interference from lousy cops<br />who are trying to distance  themselves from the WorldTradeCenter. 9/11 is 911 police number.

B00C5ZORES|4.0|Fall out Boy are def. back and the years apart have made their music on this album stronger and tighter than it has been since \\"Infinity on High.\\" In typical FOB fashion, just about every song on this album is catchy as hell with witty lyrics and over the top production. The honest fans of the band will be happy with this album; it's a fresh breath of air for their catalog of work. The songs that I really enjoyed on SR&R are:<br /><br />The Phoenix<br />My Songs know what you did in the dark<br />Alone Together<br />Miss Missing You<br />Death Valley<br /><br />What I liked most about this album is that it sounds like they had a lot fun making it. It shows on the song \\"Young Volcanoes\\" when Patrick sings a line and is followed by him laughing. I'm a serious guy and I listen to mostly serious music, but it's wonderful to hear something as simple as a bit of laughter to make the listener remember that making music can be fun. Here are some of the lyrics that really stuck out for me on the album:<br /><br />\\"I'm the best you'll never have\\"<br />\\"This is the road to ruin, and it's starting at the end\\"<br />\\"My old aches become new again, my old friends become exes again\\"<br />\\"Let's fade away together one dream at a time\\"<br />\\"I trade all my tomorrows for one yesterday\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a few things that prevented me giving this album a higher rating. What really killed it for me were all the guest appearances and the hip hop production that overshadows the songs. In my opinion, after years of not being on the airwaves, I think this album should have been nothing but Fall Out Boy, not Fall Out Boy & Friends. Not saying the songs with the guest musicians aren't good, I just think there could have been less on there. The song \\"Rat a Tat\\" w/Courtney Love is actually a really cool song...but while listening I can't help but be reminded how Courtney is such a mess and that ruins it for me. The collaboration that I liked the most was the song \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" with Elton John. I read some review online stating \\"This album sounds more like a Rihanna album than a Fall Out Boy album,\\" and I hate to admit it but I understand where they are coming from. With that said, I rather here Fall Out Boy take on that sound than any other hip hop star but you can't deny the similarities.<br /><br />I'm glad Fall Out Boy are back and that they didn't burn out like their fellow groups from the genre. Hearing this material on stage would be a real treat and a really fun show, it's good to hear new material and I hope that it becomes a successful record for them.
B00622B3MY|5.0|I'm really glad I went ahead and bought this for my two year old son. We LOVED the first cars movie, and really wanted to buy the second. I hesitated buying it because of the negative reviews saying there was too much violence for a G rated movie. I really wanted to avoid any movies with violence for such a young, vulnerable age. I waited on it for a while, and kept reading the reviews here before making the plunge and purchasing it.<br /><br />Before doing so, however, I ended up going to YouTube to see if there were any short videos of the \\"violent\\" parts, and am very happy I did. I highly recommend anyone else questioning whether or not to buy this movie to do the same, and to make your own decision based on your personal comfort level. The short scenes are out there, so be an informed consumer and watch before you buy. You should only buy this movie if you're comfortable with the worst scenes. We, personally, were fine with the \\"torturing\\" scene, as bad as that sounds. Sure, they could have skipped it all together and I wouldn't miss it whatsoever, but it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I also really wish they didn't use the word \\"kill\\" throughout the movie, since saying let's \\"GET\\" him would have the same impact. But, again, these issues weren't prevalent all throughout the entire movie and didn't effect our decision to purchase and ENJOY the movie.<br /><br />As for the wheel to wheel car fighting - well, that's just funny. My two year old smashes and crashes his cars together all the time - what's the difference? It's a fun movie, the races are exciting and the friendship lessons are great. There are some explosions and gun fire as well - so in the end you just have to decide what you're okay with your child being exposed to. If you do a little research before you can make an informed enough decision so you won't regret your purchase. To each their own - but we LOVE the cars movies!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The trilogy of the Hunger Games was the best thing I have ever experienced. I love how the author adds information bit by bit about the characters. Revealing back stories and info about each character's background, I wish I could write like that. I teared up at many places because Mrs. Suzanne Collins describes moments so well from Katniss's point of view, I felt like I was with her. In the launch room for the 74th hunger games, I could almost feel Katniss's anxiety. The prospect of leaving everything you have ever known and loved seems overwhelming. Yet somehow Mrs. Collins made it so realistic that Katniss got over that when most people I know would have broken down and probably cried their guts out. But I guess that is what happens when you are born and brought up in the nation of Panem.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My son, who just turned two, LOVES this movie. He asks for the &#34;race cars&#34; and &#34;trucks&#34; all the time. He pretends to race his toy cars while the show is on as well. We really limit his cartoons and TV at this age, since he tends to get scared very easily. This movie is great since there's absolutely no violence or language a toddler doesn't need to hear (i.e. &#34;kill&#34; &#34;stupid&#34; etc.). Overall a great story, and a lot of fun loving action. It's the only movie our son will actually watch for more than 10 minutes! Perfect for sick or rainy days!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I needed a time killer, tried this game, and now I'm addicted. My kids and I compete to see who can get the farthest.
B008NMT684|5.0|I'm amazed that my son, who just turned two last month, can do these puzzles on his own. I let him use my kindle and it's amazing to see him figure out where the pieces need to go - then drag and drop them in himself. He LOVES trucks, so this is perfect. I just wish that there were MORE. Given that it was only $2 for the full product, it was well worth the price. I also love that you're able to try a free version of this, which we did, before opting to buy it. I ended up buying it just because he kept wanting MORE and MORE truck puzzles (hence why I wish there were still even more)! He also loves the puzzle with the four individual trucks, since once they're in place you can push them and they spin! The balloons and cheering once the puzzles are complete is also a very nice touch. Great app for the kindle! It keeps him entertained for at least 30 minutes :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game with really fun attributes and fun powerups and cool boards and awesome looking people thanks for the fun game/ app
B001A5HBJC|1.0|The storyline is slow, and uneventful.  The characters are boring.  It lost my interest almost immediately.  I found this show just as lame as your average marketers commercial idea.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Great origin story for reacher fans. You get some support from characters in the other books. A must read! Great
B00CDCE9L4|5.0|This show is just fantastic.  It's a nice balance of battle, drama, and sexy time.  The acting is believable, as is the storyline.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I'm not a fan of games for phones, but I LOVE this. I love the look and the design and it's great for a few minutes of zoning out. I also love that you don't have to be sitting with your phone perfectly horizontal for it to work correctly. With that said, however, it still won't work well at extreme angles. You couldn't really play it laying back. Still, great game for a few minutes of relaxing here or there.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Like it except for the music. Should have more of a selection and the snooze white noise is annoying. Great app for the cost.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Really awesome book!! The movie of course is not half as good, but an acceptable adaptation. I loved this book!
B0051UT7Q2|5.0|I have never read such a comprehensive book, detailing the main features of 20th century Russian history. I have always been fascinated by Russia; the revolution, the quasi-communist governments and Lenin and particularly Stalin, and post 1991 with the old and new worlds still banging heads. this novel takes you through from the beginning in 1916 till 1994, with three main stages and revolving around Sashenka and her involvement in the Soviet government.<br />by far the most exciting thing about this book was 'meeting' Stalin, as most writers refer to him as the omnipresent god like figure (which he was). I say 'meeting' as that is the high level of penmanship present; you really feel like you're in the room with al the tension like a tarantino film. the real spine-tingling thing was reading characters coming face to face with the man himself, and later on discovering documents with his notes and drawings and codes all over them. other incredible figures like Beria and Lenin make an appearance too.<br />it was really exciting to see the development of Sashenka, becoming more human as the world around becomes less.<br />such a great read!
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|Its a good case it does what it needs to I have had mine for a few months now and with my 2 and 4 year old playing with my phone the case has started to stretch out a little but other than that perfect.
B005LF9IO8|2.0|movie sucks, it is too far fetched, the story line is dumb, alittle girl thats a assassin, come on get real
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun exciting and with all those special characters it's fun and remarkable and to watch it is fun to.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I really like this case. I feel that my Kindle is well protected. I like the way it props up when I want to watch it while laying down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game. It would be cool to have more ways to get free horses. I like sending and receiving gifts. The graphics are great.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie is Batman.<br /><br />It wins. Just buy it or else.<br /><br />Great acting and skills by directors and sound. This is a reference sound movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing! It kept a tight hold on me through each page, even though some points were so full of emotion that I started to cry. The book was a perfect read and I could'nt put it down!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read the 1st book last year and loved it.  I loved this one more!  And I have to say that I have enjoyed this Series possibly more than 50 Shades.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Read this after watching the series, and thought it spectacular. Really clarified some things and developed characters more elaborately for me, particularly in reference to the show. Great read!
B005G5PPGS|3.0|Not nearly as good as the movie.  Too much detail about the numbers game.  I don't want 6 more words
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|All i can say is i'm a late bloomer to the show i need more so off to the store to get more.
B0095VPBFY|4.0|Excellent graphics but a skimpy 1 MB L2 cache.  Only slightly faster than the A4-5300 but costs about $20 more.  Could have saved $20 to buy larger SSD.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Best all in one calc I ever used! I wish I had this for school 10 years ago. Fast and easy to use with all the ti features
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a magic and its fun game. you need to play the game. it's fun for all ages, enjoy!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this GAME! It's relaxing &amp; mind blowing n the same. Keep ya brain active with this kind of game!!

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book! Everyone should read this book to get a better understanding of how difficult mental illness can be to manage.
B009G3T01M|2.0|I bought the whole album from just thrift shop. That is the only song that I liked. Three more words to complete my review.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game that anybody of any age could play and have fun playing whenever and wherever on the road or at home
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|A really excellent recording by a really excellent singer.  I've never seen him in person, know him from the reviews and to finally  (why have I been so slow?) hear that great voice on CD is a real treat. SOOOOO Good!!!
B004HD61KE|4.0|James Rollins' Sigma Force novels get better and better as he hones his craft. Yes, they are escapist novels with over-the-top heroes, villains, and action scenes. That may or may not be your thing - it required some serious suspension of disbelief on my part before I decided I should just relax and enjoy them for all the fun they are. Like Michael Crichton or Dan Brown, the action is underpinned by true historical mysteries and cutting edge science. The way Rollins weaves many subplots into one fascinating yarn is masterful, and if you're like me, you'll find yourself finishing each novel in just a few sittings! I won't spoil anything from this particular tome, except to say it flows along smoothly in the overall Sigma story arc. You'll be wanting to dive right into Bloodline once you've finished...
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|my grandson is enthralled with Disney and animation and wanted this to add to his collection.  a great gift indeed.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|I had the original Bridge Constructor app, and got fed up with it because my bridges kept collapsing with too few clues as to why. This app has a very nice, thorough tutorial (it's the island called &quot;Tutoria&quot;) and I was able to figure out my problem - - you can sometimes miss getting the beam to the exact right point, and not necessarily see it on a small screen. Also,  the blue arrows on the sides bring out menus with materials and game options. Fun little physics/engineering game. Sound stayed down nicely on my HTC Sensation, too.
B0012TUPRQ|4.0|It is as described! The craftsmanship and functionality of RAM products will always leave you satisfied. A great company, selling hardware that get the job done for years and years!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The pilot episode was excellent and really leaves me looking forward to the remaining seasons.  It is so convenient to be able to watch episodes at my time without waiting a week for the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like this app my friends have it on there I devises and I got this app in version 0.5.0<br /> I love the pc version and cant wait for 0.7.0
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This beautiful story of an unbeautiful young man is one of the most heartwarming and enjoyable books I have ever read. Don't be surprised when tears appear or when you actually laugh aloud. This fifth graders story should be read by all ages.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Reading this book quickly became an obsession. I am very eager to start the next in the series. Must read.
B0030MTQNW|5.0|I know this is considered a classic movie... I finally decided to watch it since I am living in the area where it all took place and was filmed. It was a very engaging film, and longer than I thought it would be... gave a very good sense of the drama and desperation of the times...
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|Contrary to one of the one-star reviews, this is a licensed spinoff of the original game, and a great deal as a Free App of the Day,  Nor do I think the permissions are excessive.<br /><br />This is a fun physics style game.  It is the &#34;playground&#34; version of the original game because, apparently, you can earn badges for achievements, something that isn't in the original game.<br /><br />You build bridges, try to stay under budget and within safety requirements.  You test your bridge by driving cars and, if you're feeling really good, trucks.  You get badges for building a car-safe bridge, a truck-safe bridge, staying within budget, staying safe and using a minimal amount of materials.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this game!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I have not read the books and only heard about the mixed reviews when the movie came out. I really enjoyed the movie and look forward to the next installment.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series, beautiful scenery, interesting ideas, fascinating characters, lovely costumes, true English flavor.  A glimpse of a life I would never know  about.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|As American's we should all stand proud that warriors like Chris Kyle were willing to give so much to defend our freedom. I would have loved to have bought him a cold beer, and I'm saddened his children will not grow up with their dad but I'm confident his character will live on in their hearts. God Bless Chris, his family and his sacrifice!
0783240236|5.0|My favorite Alfred Hitchcock thriller and another Rod Taylor movie that I highly enjoy and still watch over and over again. It has that typical Hitchcock ending that doesn't tell you why the birds were attacking but leaves that to your imagination.
1568363931|5.0|Very well written and just a pleasure to read whether you decide to follow through and use the recipe or just read through the book and enjoy the illustrations. Very informative and easy to follow.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|A very early Leslie Nielsen movie about a group of earthlings that travel to a strange planet and contact scientist played by Walter Pidgeon who unleashes his ID monster to kill. Great special effects and the introduction of Robby the robot.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|To have the entire collection in one package is ourstanding.  I donated all the others to my local library.  Hopefully some of the people who don't buy films will be able to view them now.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Having heard just a few interesting things about Tesla, Iwas eager to learn more.  This short read proved to be &#34;the ticket&#34; for wanting to know more about this amazing man!  I highly recommend this book.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|How they made him look so small and skinny is amazing.  I grew up on Captain America comics and I love that they have brought him back as one the the new Avengers.  This movie is well worth the price if you like adventure without all the sex and foul language.  There is none !!!!!  Nice for a change.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|It's not the best app it freezes up and you don't do much I give I a 3 star rating
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved this movie. It was sad, happy, glorious, depressing all at the same time. It portrayed that teen/young adult angst so VERY well. As the end of the movie was nearing, I was afraid the end would be unsatisfying, but the great acting and voice overs &#34;closed the circle&#34; on a well-done movie.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|it was a big hit for me in the theaters but then again What QT movie isn't? Even the ones he doesn't Direct ( True Romance )... so if you are a fan of either QT or even JF then you will want to see this one, unfortunately it is NOT kid friendly so wait until they are tucked in bed! :)
B009JBZH54|5.0|No complaints. On time and great quality. It arrived before Christmas and was everything my husband was hoping it to be.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love Les Miserables. It is such an excellent story. I never fail to enjoy reading it. Each time I do I learn something new.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Tubemates one of my many have to have apps. Installed on every device I own.I give two thumbs up,more if I had them.lol This is my all in one music media/social networking app. that not only allows me to browse a huge selection of music media,it also enables me the choice to download it in multiple file formats,and that's why in my opnion Tubemate's one of the best.
0670026557|2.0|In reading reviews of this book, ask yourself whether it is the book being reviewed, or is it the premise (concept) of the book. I re-read the reviews that enticed me into reading this book and found that, under a critical reading, they seemed to be predominantly the latter. And when you encounter a review that lauds the book as \\"new\\", \\"revolutionary\\"... while also contrarily reporting its content as \\"well-known\\", \\"proven\\" or an established part of the reviewer's professional life, be skeptical.*<br /><br />My background: I am in my 60s and I now read this category of book not for myself, but to assist in my mentoring of others. I spent my career in high tech, 30 years in Silicon Valley.<br /><br />At the core of my negative reaction to this book is a difference in world view. The book claims that \\"givers are a rare breed of people\\" (inside of jacket). My experience is that they are hardly rare**, and there are daily reminders of that -- for example the response to the recent Boston Marathon bombing. What you see are many people who are _reflexively_ givers (no pause for calculation). Note: I am not denying the existence of \\"takers\\" and \\"matchers\\", but take issue with the book's estimates of their numbers as being too high.<br /><br />The book's subtitle \\"A Revolutionary Approach to Success\\" reveals how divorced from reality it is. The characteristics of the \\"giver\\" have long been taught in a wide range of leadership courses -- the only thing new here is the name. The \\"Servant Model\\" of Christianity (and other religions) is often invoked in these leadership courses, including some by the US military.<br /><br />The book even argues against itself: It opens with a study claiming that \\"givers\\" dominate the group of most successful people and later argues that this is not invisible. No matter -- much of the rest of the book is spent using examples to argue for the existence of such people. And much of what this book highlights as making someone a giver is misdirected -- in my experience, those actions are side-effects or peripheral to the core. Although working on this periphery might help with the core, my experience is that it is not very effective (analogy: Forcing a smile can somewhat improve your mood, but actually being happy is better).<br /><br />The book seems to come from within a bubble where the \\"me first\\" culture is seen as normal and pervasive.[6] Speculation: The author may be wrongly projecting what he sees in his MBA students as being representative of the business world and wider society. If you don't reside in such a bubble, much of what is in this book is tediously obvious.<br /><br />The book is dominated by inept parables -- the type you might sit uncomfortably through during a church sermon from a mediocre preacher (except they are from the business world rather than the Bible). These parables have little instructive content other than \\"It is good to be a giver\\" and \\"Givers can be winners\\",[5] but this comes only after plodding through a page or two or more of mostly irrelevant biographic detail. Many parables use such extreme cases that they can be regarded as only motivational. The parables didn't cover anything about leadership and character that I hadn't learned before going off to college, but then I grew up in the days when supervised youth activities were the exception and thus we had abundant opportunities to observe and practice.<br /><br />One expects books of this category to be bloated with excessive repetition that is compensated for by a writing style that allows the reader to breeze through and get its few nuggets. I found the parables so annoyingly presented that I could not do this. Part of my annoyance is that the template for parables signals that they are inauthentic and manipulative. Part is that the stories are so single-minded and narrowly focused on \\"the message\\" that they avoid any analysis as real-world situations, thereby undermining credibility and relevance. Add to this that many come across as just a way for the author to flaunt the people he seems to know (a type of taker he labels a \\"peacock\\").*** I have used \\"parable\\" for the stories to emphasize that these are not \\"case studies\\", as one might expect from an author who is a business school professor, or even very simplified versions of such, but rather theology.<br /><br />The book's presentation of Freecycle as exceptional illustrates the basic analytic failings of this book. First, Freecycle was just another creation of a community or corporate culture -- something that has long been a basic part of leadership and Organizational Psych. Second, Freecycle didn't really create anything new, but rather provided a much larger scale alternative to what had long been happening on a wide range of email lists, discussion groups,... And that sharing of physical goods had been a natural growth of the sharing of information on those groups, which had built upon ... Rather than creating a new culture, Freecycle was largely recruiting, and facilitating, people already well into that culture (and was much appreciated).<br /><br />Interspersed with the parables are accounts of various psychological studies. If you have taken the normal introductory courses in Psychology and Organizational Psychology, or done equivalent readings, much of this will already be familiar to you, or at least unsurprising. And the presentation of these studies is motivational -- in keeping with the tone of the parables -- rather than analytical.**** I understand that an author may well want to include such material for newbies, but the book's format should allow more typical readers to easily ID and skip it. This book does the reverse.<br /><br />The book makes brief and shallow excursions into how being a \\"giver\\" can get you into trouble, but I judge it to only be enough to alert the reader to existence of such problems, but not enough to provide real-world assistance.<br /><br />Disclosure: I didn't read every page of this book. I read the initial chapters and then started a pattern of skipping a few pages and reading to see if there was anything worthwhile. My rating of 2-star (Amazon's interpretation: \\"I disliked it\\") is based upon its having been a total waste of time, and I was very tempted to give it only 1 star (\\"I hated it\\") because of its fraudulent promotion.<br /><br />---- Footnotes ----<br />* Recognize that the publisher, not the author, controls the hyperbole in the promotional materials.

This sort of narrow, distorted interpretations permeate the book, making it unsuitable even as an alternative to more traditional materials on this topic.<br /><br />6.[Added 2013-04-26] What the book calls \\"powerless communication\\" has long been taught as techniques in leadership, negotiation and persuasion (and even interrogation).

This sort of narrow, distorted interpretations permeate the book, making it unsuitable even as an alternative to more traditional materials on this topic.<br /><br />6.[Added 2013-04-26] What the book calls \\"powerless communication\\" has long been taught as techniques in leadership, negotiation and persuasion (and even interrogation). My inference was that the book was positioning this in contrast to an approach that emphasized _establishing_ dominance, possibly even bullying the other parties. If true, this is a Strawman: One of the basic lessons about leadership is that power based on bullying and related methods is expensive and fragile, if not illusory, and likely to be transient.<br /><br />-- Douglas B.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Sometime understanding the story a book is trying to tell may be futile.<br />A DVD can tell the story in 2 hours and you will remember it.<br />This version of US History is very good and should be viewed.<br />I believe if you can not read history then watch it on DVD.<br />Excellent Movie
B00BLDD3A4|5.0|First... I HIGHLY recommend watching the Sound City documentary! Actually....just purchase it because I GUARANTEE you will love it and want to own a copy!<br />The doc will give you the all inclusive insight to this music album and an even greater appreciation for it as a whole and for Dave Grohl and all the artists involved in making this album.  I was about halfway through watching the documentary when I jumped on Amazon and bought this digital album.<br />Lastly, YouTube Dave Grohl and SXSW 2013 (South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin)....check out his speech and everything else you can find ....they will all be added bonuses to music appreciation for the doc and this album and artists that span decades....Dave Grohl made pieces of history come ALIVE!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The only negative with this app is it wont open. it has worked in the past great until recently and it won't open. When I try to play it, it closes back down. Does anyone have any suggestions for this other than reinstalling? I have a lot of time invested in it. Other than that, I would give it a five instead of four. I think this problem is a fluke because I'm known to have bad luck with applications and technology in general.
B00A2DIW3C|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how interesting this book was! Not only did it enlighten me about the stealth technology it also entertained me. Rich seems humble but also very accomplished. It was interesting to learn how the government USED to work more efficiently behind closed doors.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love everything about this show...the actors, the clothes, their way of life. Would'nt it be fun to live like that for one week, just for the experience!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoy reading books spoken from a dog's point of view so this was a good read for me.  This book is actually a love story with realistic characters and a family dynamic that causes heartache.  Enzo, the dog, is lovable and funny.  This is an easy read and goes fast.  If you love dogs, give it a try, you won't regret it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This fantastic movie is just as good, if not better, than the Lord of the RIngs trilogy.  The Dwarf city is one of the most amazing peices of CGI that I have ever seen, whoever designed this city is a Genius.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love Harry Potter movies and this was the best way to purchase the entire collection at a great price!
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|Very nice and relaxing music that brings back good memories from watching the series. Cannot wait until season 4 starts.
B003W9JELC|5.0|Say what you will about Miley or the Hannah franchise but this movie is a really fun watch, especially for a family movie night (or a night with your girlfriends). It's got a little bit of everything: comedy, music, romance and life lessons — think of it as a musical if you will.
0345803507|5.0|I am sure I have nothing more to say, that has not been said.  I swore I would not like these books, but as I got it for a gift, I read it.  Best thing I ever did.  Love these books, beyond all reason!  Just loose yourself in the magic.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I LOVE Harry Potter like the rest of us book nerds out there but this is by far the worst film of the script-to-screen adaptations in this franchise (Order of the Phoenix being the best in my opinion, not counting the &#34;resolution&#34; films). The acting is still excellent, the plot still glorious, it's just not the best film of the series.
0345803493|5.0|I am sure I have nothing more to say, that has not been said.  I swore I would not like these books, but as I got it for a gift, I read it.  Best thing I ever did.  Love these books, beyond all reason!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|As excellent as expected. Would like to see the movie in 2 parts but I'm willing to spend the money and wait the incredible length of time it takes to see all 3.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Easy to snap the kindle fire 7 in place and works for both landscape and portrait. Works like a charm!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Just what I wanted it for and does an amazing job. I ALWAYS recommend this thermal paste and this paste only. I have used this thermal paste for years on my laptop, desktop, Xbox and other applications. This is the only thermal paste I have seen perform greatly under heat and creates a secure bonded connection between the CPU and heatsink.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|A suspenseful movie with fantastic visual effects. A must watch for comic book enthusiasts. You could compare this movie to green lantern, iron man, or wolverine.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I was having trouble viewing FB from my Kindle, so I google it.  Duh!  Just needed to download the full version.  No more trouble viewing the whole FB screen.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|Listening to the story of how Bob wrote &#34;Ride Natty Ride&#34; was deeply moving. His father's well to do family, threw Bob's mother and him out onto the street when they asked for help. At the time, his father's family owned the largest construction company in Jamaica, now the only reference to them ever existing is through the song created by the child that they cast aside. Bob Marley is most certainly one of the 5 greatest musicians of all time and this story will help further that legacy.
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|I like Evangelion 1.11, but I wouldn't say it is fantastic. The second film in the Rebuild Of Evangelion series is much better. This is just a basic retelling of the first couple of episodes from the series. It's not bad, I certainly enjoy it.  However, it's just nothing much new. If you are an Eva fan I would say this is a must have, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking to get into Evagelion. The second film, Evangelion 2.22 blows this one away though.
B00C9SRN5Q|5.0|Read it and you will understand! I could not put this little gem down. I plan on reading it again after I have digested all of its goodness!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Evangelion 2.22 is amazing. The first film in the series was mostly a faithful retelling of the first few episodes (with a few tweaks and changes), but this time around Evangelion 2.22 takes the story on a new path. It's truly amazing and is way better than the first film from the Rebuild Of Evangelion series. The film looks fantastic on Blu-ray!
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|Bought this and the Hape stove for my daughters second birthday. They are so cute and the products look very nice as well. She loves playing with it. Great purchase.
B0015442YU|4.0|excellent action and really twisted characters as expected. It is a must see for those that can handle crazy. It took me a while to buy into the main actress.
B000FA675C|5.0|We do have this book in paperback and the movie. Like having this book electronically, so that I can read it whenever, wherever I want.
B0037VNX44|3.0|this is one weird and disturbing movie...but intriguing. It is an interesting point of view. The lead actor did a great job.
B0053O89IS|4.0|I ordered season 6 and season 7 at the same time, but for some reason, season 7 arrived before season 6.  I had to twiddle my thumbs waiting for season 6.  Other than that... no worries.  The formatting of the disks is unique from other TV series I've had on DVD in that you cannot scene-select.  So, if you have to stop mid-show for some reason, you'll have to just skip forward and hope you can get to where you left off without too much overlap.  But, this creates a stuttering problem sometimes, too.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|It´s a great guide even for beginners ! Totally recommended.<br />It gives total flexibility for those who just want to build a home aquaponics system or a bigger one for commercial use.
B003L77G8I|4.0|I ordered season 6 and season 7 at the same time, but for some reason, season 7 arrived before season 6.  I had to twiddle my thumbs waiting for season 6.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This should have been made immediately after the Ring series.  Can't believe they are making 3 movies out of a 200 page book, however.  Excellent visuals!  Excellent cast!  Can't wait for the next two to be released!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An amazing story of one persons daunting determination to overcome his addiction to drugs and join the elite fighting force the navy SEALS.  The odds that Adam has to overcome are incredible. The story is told with emotion and pays homage to a great man.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|What an amazing cast!  Wonderful storyline.  Well written dialogue (which is hard to find).  I highly recommend this movie to everyone!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|An amazing story of personal survival however it sometimes conflicts with other sources including official sources.  This does not subtract from the incredible tail of survival nor the interesting account of SEAL training.  The book is at times extremely prejudiced which may make some readers feel uncomfortable.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've read ALL of Stephen King's books, but this was definitely one of the BEST.  It took me a while to get to it, but once I started there was no turning back.  I thought....time travel and the JFK assination??  Really???  But it was so much more!  Long, but worth it!
B008KOTNVA|5.0|If you're looking for a quality top-notch kit for working on laptops or other small electronic components, This kit is perfect. It's got just about every imaginable size and everything is well-crafted. NOT JUNK! All the bits are slightly magnetized to retain small screws. The case is constructed of a sturdy plastic and all the bits are arranged in 9 separate well-crafted retainers that are labeled to keep the bits organized.<br /><br />Not sure where it was manufactured. However, it does not say made in China, nor does it look or feel like it was.
0385344333|1.0|The thing that made this series interesting, Reacher's personality and character are amazingly pretty much totally ignored in this book, If Lee Child even wrote this book which is somewhat doubtful, it was definitely only for the money. Was this pathetic book actually a best seller? Please don't waste your money. I spent five dollars on it but that was at least four dollars too much.<br /><br />  What made Reacher interesting was his very unique unusual loner personality which Child portrayed very very well and of course his ability to beat the hell out of people and to still have odds in his favor even if the odds were four to one against him. In this book, Reacher's unique and unusual quirks are almost totally ignored, that he buys all his clothes new and then throws them away, that he loves and drinks cups and cups of coffee, especially free refills, that he spends lots of time in diners. In this book it's almost over before he beats up anyone. Very strange. A very odd effort by Child and very poor. In this book, Reacher is a pretty boring character much like his fellow characters.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|We thought Lord of the Rings was much better.  There was very little story told in this first installment.  To many fighting scenes as usual and not enough story.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|a real american classic, i absolutely love the story and the depth that this movie has. I would recommend this to anyone!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|WHY ARE SEASONS 1 and 2 FREE FOR PRIME MEMBERS, BUT YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE SEASON 3?!?  COME ON AMAZON!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Many twists and turns, what is real what is fiction; too many ins and outs. Lies and truths; where is this going.  Who is the liar, who is the user?
B0068MNO4S|5.0|i'm sold on the theory.  well performed.  i am now and forever an earl of oxford fan.  all his works are incredible.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This is a well written book by a very tallented runner.  Scott answers the question of why he runs and what running has done for him.  He has also included some wonderful recipes.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over.  phenomenal music by hans and lisa.  and of course russell could not be better.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Love this movie and all the extras that come w/it! Arrived in perfect condition!
184448551X|5.0|of the marvelous technique of blackwork.  thanks very much royal school.  what would we needle people do without you. sincerely,  vicki fraser
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|If you are familiar with the Batman run that this is adapted from then you know the story.  This 2 part series is a very loyal adaptation of The Dark Knight Returns comic.  The animation is good, the voice work is great, and the story is one of the best.  To be honest, I liked this movie more than The Dark Knight Rises.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I just absolutely adore the style Jamie McGuire wrote this book. The story line is beautifully written & all of the characters are interesting enough to write their own books. I would love for Pigeon &Travis' story to never end. I hope after the 2nd book there will b a 3rd & 4th ;))))))<br /><br />P.s<br />Getting ready to start the 2nd installment of this series :)<br />P.p.s<br />This book was so great, i read it twice with out skipping or scanning any pages like i usually do when re-reading a book ;))))
B00BESNKB8|2.0|Let's get one thing out of the way.  RZA can't act.  In this and the most recent G.I. Joe I found myself physically cringing at almost every line he delivered.  That said, the first act of the movie (when he isn't in it) was pretty fun.  Unfortunately everything devolves from that point.  I understand that RZA is a fan of old Kung Fu movies but all this movie made me want to do is go watch the classics again.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It may not be a well-written book but it does begin to have a good storyline. Sad but intriguing. Even though it is very sexual it catches every attention and pulls you in.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This was a fabulous book that translated nicely to the big screen.  I was impressed with this movie and highly recommend it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I like the story within the story model.  Patrick's character Kvothe is one for the ages.  He begins as a promising youth in a family troupe performing tales across the land. He meets a wise elder who introduces him to real magic.  K othe then suffers the tragic fall of his family to dark magic.  His grief leads him to city streets and music.  He continues his quest to learn about the dark magic by attending the university of the elder.  Kvothe rises fast in the university making use of his talent and friends.  He searches for a local event of dark magic and saves the town and his love.  I can't wait for the remainder of the trilogy!  On Wisconsin!  T.Ro in Madison.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This is a fabulous movie.  I especially like the fact that you get the blue ray and a dvd movie!
055358202X|5.0|Less a review than suggestion.<br /><br />\\"Negative\\" backlash to this one (\\"meandering,\\" \\"felt like nothing happens,\\" etc.) felt a bit true after 100 pages (why am I reading about gestating politicking in the seemingly irrelevant Iron Islands when I have no idea what Tyrion is up to?,) so I skipped \\"ahead\\" (simultaneous in timeline) to \\"A Dance with Dragons.\\" Then I skipped back, because who doesn't want to see what Cercei is doing in King's Landing?<br /><br />This is probably how the TV show will handle it, and it's probably how readers should now handle it. If you're up to book 4, you're already all in on \\"somewhat meandering.\\" If the particular material in this volume is occasionally weak, it's really weak in isolation, focusing on arguably \\"lesser\\" characters. As a reader of the first three books, the most frustration came from abrupt switches to characters you're less invested in. The original editorial decision to split the volumes enhanced that frustration to near book-length. Alternating between the two books offers a good counterbalance, and no downside I can comprehend.<br /><br />There's some guide to doing so online, chronologically, but I'm just reading them both now, alternating chapters haphazardly. Characters are so separate, no storytelling issues have arisen. The end of \\"Dance with Dragons\\" goes chronologically ahead of \\"Feast for Crows,\\" so keep that in mind.<br /><br />Readers of the previous books are already totally onboard with \\"favorite characters appear alternating with a bunch of other stuff too.\\" I really don't mind reading about Cercei and Brienne if you also get Dany and Tyrion, but can you blame the original reviewers for being annoyed? TV viewers would be even more outraged, I think.<br /><br />Read separately: you get Frankenbooks, compared to the previous volumes.<br /><br />Read together (either strategically or randomly): feels like a gigantic equivalent of the previous 3 books.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting and extremely well written. The best drama on television. Loved Season 1 and 3 as well. Can't wait for more!
B00782O7IY|3.0|Did not feel the story had depth. Liked the dancing. Would not watch it again. Gave it to my granddaughter.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I bought this to plug into my Windows Surface Pro and it works perfectly.  It works plugged in directly as well as through a hub.  I'm happy with this device and have no complaints.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|This is a very good album. I have seen discussions as to whether or not BlackBerry Smoke is Southern Rock or Country Western. After you listen to this album, it won't matter what genre they are. All  of the songs are good. Give it a listen and try to pick a favorite.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get some good music. I rarely give five stars, but I think this one deserves it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Any one who considers themselves an agnostic should read this book.  It is very encouraging for those who doubt the existence of a life hereafter.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|An interesting glimpse into the genuis that is Tina Fey.  I enthusiasticly reccommend this book for those who would like to know Ms. Fey a bit better.
B001TODCII|5.0|I have always liked Liam Neeson.  He is a great actor.  Before I purchased the CD I went to  the show three different times to see the movie.  Each time I noticed something that I had not previously seen.  A must for anyone's library.
B00499NHLC|5.0|My sister made me watch the first show and I was hooked.  I still have the next 2 seasons to watch and I am so excited!  Plus, it has Bilbo Baggins in it!  Extra little perk!
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|Great movie for my grandkids, they loved it.  Product arrived on time as described.  I would gladly do business again.
B00C27LB20|5.0|Great record by an outstanding young talent...shades of Dylan with a modern sound...can't stop listening and well worth taking a chance on!
B0000AK7A8|4.0|Great to watch with the kids, by yourself or with anyone.  Christina Ricci is the bomb in this and her other movies as well.
B00006JIA4|5.0|this is a must have for the queen fan.the covers most of their entire career,from the earliest to the end.
B008LC8TJI|2.0|Unfortunately I jumped the gun on this one - I thought it would be as good as some of their other stuff but, unfortunately it isn't
B000VYNYN0|4.0|Very good for its time! Effects are classic! I would recommend to watch it before watching the new one. :D
B0052AC8C6|4.0|this is a good one to watch for 15 minutes at a time or so for pre-bedtime wind-down:).<br /><br />best! gwyneth
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is an amazing app I use it with all my school work and this app is a tremendous help highly recommended
B000FA675C|3.0|I love the Robert Langdon character. And even though I did not like this book as much as Angels & Demons, it is not a bad book. It just seemed to move a little slower than I had hoped. Look forward to reading 'The Lost Symbol' and 'Inferno' when available.
B002ZG99G8|4.0|If your looking for drama and suspense go somewhere else. If your looking for action and one liners carry on this movie is for you. Story line is decent and the actors are good and attractive. Not even close to the budget of the most recent comic book based movies but similar style. Enjoy!
B0046ECJBY|5.0|Kissinger comes off as sort of a China apologist in some places, but this is a good overview of US-China relations.  His realist prescriptions are a good guide for peaceful relations between the two countries.
B004S5FW1U|5.0|Watched the movie first and then felt compelled to read the book. I'm very glad I did, the book is far more detailed than the movie and I got a better understanding of the characters and their journey. I would recommend reading this book!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I bought this season for someone who loves Downton Abbey. She has begun to enjoy watching. The episodes all over again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was an amazing experience to read this book<br />This was absolutely the best book l have ever ever read.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|You already know how it all turns out. But even with our historical hindsight &#34;Lincoln&#34; is memorable for many things, one of which is D.D. Lewis' performance as the titular character. While we don't have any media record of Lincoln except photos, one can almost feel Lincoln coming out of the pages of history. Spielberg does it again!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Laughter is the best medicine and it makes me laugh when he repeats my words.  Sometimes he might miss some though.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Love, love, love it!  I love that my family can watch it over and over.  Each time we see it, we understand more of the dialogue and appreciate the story even more.
0345803485|2.0|What is all the hullabaloo about?  Granted, this book is titilating, but that is about all I can say for it!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli is the BEST and this cd is another in my collection of his CDS....I Love it!! Don't understand the language much LOL but i just LOVE his music....He gives me goose bumps :) Nobody Better then ANDREA BOCELLI!!
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|No one can sing about the feeling of being in love like Willie Nelson. There is a honesty and wisdom in his voice. He makes me believe in every word of every song.  His love songs are superb.  I especially like the tunes  \\"You'll Never Know\\" and \\"I'll Keep On Loving You\\". He also makes believe that it is possible to fall out of love. \\"Is The Better Part Over\\"  is a beautiful song about what it feels like when the spark in a relationship fizzles out. \\"Shame On You\\" is an upbeat song about finding out that a lover has been unfaithful. \\"Twilight Time\\" is a song that makes me warm and cozy.  I have to mention all the talented musicians on this album.  His sister Bobbie accompanies Willie beautifully on the piano. Mickey Raphael plays the harmonica on the album. His instrument gives the song \\"Matchbox\\" a jolt of energy that I enjoy.  He compliments Willie's vocals well. I love the music on this album.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Great game play only issue I have is you are unable to aim with the wand as a wizard. Regular close quarter play is great and smooth.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Non-existent plot, completely unbelievable/unlikable characters, not funny, overall irritating to watch and I feel like someone needs to stop Apatow before he hurts someone else.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Interesting and complex characters that make this a great &#34;who-done-it?&#34; novel.  I have recommended GONE GIRL to several friends- I really enjoyed it!
0385349947|4.0|As a working professional in a male dominated field (engineering), with 35+ years of experience, I can attest to what Ms Sandberg says. While there are plenty of cultural factors that are barriers to women's upward mobility, there are certainly barriers we cause all by ourselves. &#34;Lean In&#34; is a good mantra to remember.
B003NX76BM|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. I've been a Nora Roberts fan for years. This was easily one of my favorites. The writing have been formulaic and I already how this would end but,her main characters were great. Loved Simon,more Ioved Fiona. I loved her strength and the fact that she wasn't waiting for someone to rescue her
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I saw iphone chargers in the store that cost a lot more... this one works fine, the coiled cord is a great design
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great app where u get to play tons of games and earn points to unlock games. Awesome game really loved it!
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Very good modern adaptation of Sherlock Holmes.  Bears watching twice to catch all the details.  Fits in well with the other two movies in this series.  Finally an explanation of Sherlock's origins.
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|Creative, with a theatrical flair encroaching on fantasy.  This version of a timeless work held our attention throughout and made us think.  Memorable.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I wish I had known earlier that a movie had been made to show the direction that the one season series was going.  One felt so much a part of the crew, both in outerspace and in a western setting at the same time.  English and Chinese cultures combined in a most imaginative fashion.  One of a kind!
0553801473|5.0|After reading the first four books I could not wait for this book in paperback.  Hope book 6 arrives soon
0345803485|1.0|I don't read much in the way of &#34;tales for adults only&#34;, so I don't have a lot to compare this to, but so far, total crap.  I have no idea why so many women were swooning over this one.  The lead male character is physically and sexually abusive and the female lead is juvenile and moronic.  If that's your thing, fine, but I've seen better stuff written on bathroom walls than in the pages of this fire pit kindling.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|We don't subscribe to HBO.  Wanted to see their version of the characters from the book.  Also enjoyed the background.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|It you love a film about unbreakable love than you will love this film! I watch it everyday. I can't get enough.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie \\"Mememto,\\" you have to read this book.  What a premise!  The narrator can't remember anything from day to day.  The author has captured what this would be like allowing you to feel the frustration, helplessness, and terror that the narrator is experiencing.  The reader has as difficult time as the narrator in discerning what is real.  Think of the movie \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" which captured the audience in the main character's illusions.  You go back and forth thinking you have it figured out.  I couldn't put it down until the end, not that it's action-packed, but it is fast-paced due to its psychological edginess.
6304712936|5.0|I first saw this film in high school and I fell in love with it. I had to get it on dvd.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|Every one of her albums are really good. Her videos are awesome still love before he cheats the best. lol.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I watched this show a few years ago.  I missed the last couple seasons I was very pleased to see it on the Amazon prime line up. Kurt Sutter *Sons of Anarchy* was a writer on the show and you can see him starting to push the limits...Does it go as far as he does now?  no.  That said if your a fan of the sons at least watch a few episodes here.
0439023513|1.0|I just finished reading Mockingjay and all I can say is that, like many of the other one- and two-star reviews, I absolutely loved the first two books and completely hated this one. The first half of the book is for the most part Katniss being ferried around an underground bunker and being told what's happening rather than actively engaging in the events. Just when you think the action's about to pick up, it falls flat. Most characters just kind of fizzle out or are killed off in a couple of lines. The main characters that we've come to know and care about throughout the course of the series are flat and very unlikable.<br /><br />My only hope is that the movie version is drastically different from the book.
B008X5CMCS|4.0|The stars given here are more a reflection of the &#34;stars&#34; on screen.  Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, and lest we forget the amazingly gorgeous Igraine as portrayed by Katrine Boorman.  Still a fun flick, and the effects hold up for the most part.  The Legend of Arthur may be timeless and the film (mostly) stays true to that ideal, but &#34;Excalibur' is definitely showing just the slightest signs of rust.
B009AMANBA|2.0|Most people are amazed when they read what Abraham Lincoln REALLY thought about Black people, because it sure wasn't all this egalitarian, liberal gush that revisionist \\"historians\\" like to make us think.  Browse through the internet sometime and you won't believe your eyes.  And that is part of why a movie done the way this one was is also unbelievable.<br /><br />Good acting, great costumes, very good sets, and generally correct \\"atmosphere\\".  Too much of the rest of it is preachy propaganda from people who try to make Lincoln seem like something that, historically speaking, he was NOT.

B000HX6DCO|3.0|\\"Without ever being a fan or a viewer at all of South Park, the 1999 film adaptation is a rather respectable yet at times annoying one. The South Park movie thankfully complements some of its downfalls which is noticeable in its musical numbers and short length (at 77 minutes) for its scathing satire and commentary on the power of profanity.<br /><br />Profanity, in of itself, is an action motivated by many emotions and can be inducted as free speech but the film examines how it takes four kids to be willing to idolise two foul-mouthed Canadians and sneak into an R-rated film and cause havoc in their little town. The controversial nature behind its narrative is the subject of many documentaries on censorship and after initial interest from This Film is Not Yet Rated, the film seemed much more like something I would give a try. The debate lingers on but, in all honesty, depends on how you conduct things in the matter of parenting and thought control as if you reprimand or wholly allow swearing.<br /><br />While the film's explicit dialogue and content is not suitable for the impressionable, if you do allow your teenagers to watch South Park (or Family Guy, for that matter), it is important that you teaching them children to be careful of acting, behaving, or using certain words in public is a matter of discipline, respect, and dignity. Teach them early when they're young and learning before havoc breaks in.\\"
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|The first hour plus is really slow and I read that on other reviews. You can't compare this to Lord of the Rings. Its not as good. I doubt this will ever come close to those three movies.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I'm sooooooooo hungry. It's good to finally get my fill. This game oh man teeth. Happiness and flying. Boom. Face.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was refreshing to get away from just sex and follow this interesting story. Wish you could follow up with a sequel.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I love this movie. It is a classic. The movie was brand new and the product was shipped quickly upon purchase.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I got this movie for  a 5yr old grandmother and 7 yr old grandson...they both enjoyed it .  Often my grandaughter is frightened by movies but this one seemed to fit the bill for good entertainment.....the politics is subliminal for a child!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I like this game very much. I played it all the time on line before I got this one.<br />It sharpens the mind.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have both paid and free versions of PACMAN! It is nostalgic which I played 25 years ago in late 1980s. I really wish the 8bitty works with this. Had no luck so far. But it is awesome game and my daughter loves too. Sound effect A+++++
B009JZWO3I|5.0|It was extremely different case and I was moved on how the girl kept her stand.  Also you are wondering about what is going to happen with Cary and the other 4th year attorneys who they took the partnership away from AND the fact that Alicia is NOT telling the other partners about it!!  Then you have the question of whether Diane is going to the Supreme Court but I don't really see that happening.  One she's loyal to Will, and second they are hinting that there is a lot more there that Diane does not know or understand about him....leaves you wondering what has Will really done???
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It was a good hidden object game. It could have had some other click on objects besides the hidden object screens.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Kept you interested.  Very good plot, and acting.  Not your usual scary movie.  definitely see it, you will enjoy it.
B007T8BYWE|3.0|I like nonograms, and thought I'd like these types of puzzles it was okay but doesn't really have the appeal of a true nonogram, the pics are already there and all you have to do is pick the right block to flip it and see the pic below, if you like this sort of thing than by all means get it, but for those of us who enjoy the true challenge of a nonogram, don't bother, but it is a good thing for killing a few minutes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like the animation of this game. It also teachs kids how to care for a horse. It is a very good game for children for 6 and up. If you want a realistic game for you child I 'd suggest this game.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|For those that read the book, the adventure is brought to life in this inspiring movie... Can't wait for the next one...
0765356139|3.0|I found this to be a slower read than book one,  The story is still interesting and I will finish the Trilogy hoping that the final book is better.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I hate to only give this book 3 stars but I really was so so disappointed by the ending.  I feel like the author got tired and wanted to immediately wrap the book up so she ended the book without any thought.  I will say I could not put this book down and other then the ending, the book was awesome.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I never received it - twice now - I keep ordering and they never show up on my kindle - my credit card gets charged
B00AR3WD8W|3.0|Be advised, this isn't the full, uncut concert.  A lot of talking between songs is cut out and I was disappointed by that.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Loved it! Love the murder mystery and the chemistry between Heat and Took! Can't wait to read the next book!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best post apocoliptic thriller! I looked forward to every episode the characters are deep and well developed. I would recommend it to any one
B009O2XY12|3.0|Not really something I liked or my grandson liked, but it's okay.  As represented and now I'm a little more selective on the apps I download.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|It was funny, because I was watching Phil Collins/Genesis videos on youtube and saw the video for &#34;Grimes-Genesis&#34;. I thought &#34;This looks interesting, let's give it a whirl&#34;.<br /><br />I am sorry to say, that Phil Collins will have to wait for my love, because I am ALL ABOUT GRIMES.<br /><br />Being a HUGE fan of Kate Bush, Enya, and Aphex Twin, I was not surprised to learn that these artists were influences of Claire Boucher.<br /><br />If you like those artists, then give Grimes a listen. Her  music combines elegant but dark atmosphere, great lyrical writing with good poppy beats, which makes &#34;Visions&#34; and eclectic mix of songs. Her music videos are also amazing, and definitely an intriguing part of Grimes.

B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|The Strokes' \\"Comedown Machine\\" sounds like it just dropped down from the mid-80's. There's plenty of skritchy guitar work and an overabundance of synthesizers, with Julian Casablacas both singing in a falsetto and in his usual distorted style. You may think I exaggerate, but the first time I heard \\"One Way Trigger,\\" I was prepared for the band to break into a cover of A-ha's \\"Take On Me.\\" Yes, it's that derivative.<br /><br />At the same time, it's absolutely The Stokes. It may be hard to believe, but this album is arriving 10 years after the mucho hyped debut of \\"Is This It,\\" so anyone expecting The Strokes not to mature a bit probably needs to do a little growing up themselves. The band themselves acknowledge this on \\"All The Time\\" as the plead \\"You're livin' too fast,\\" and as they explore dance rhythms on \\"Welcome To Japan,\\" which is something the older, more hyper-active Strokes would have not bothered with in their younger days.<br /><br />\\"Comedown Machine\\" is sometimes a bit too much of a vacuum production-wise, as, like \\"Angles,\\" the sound is often cleaner and slicker than a whistle. That doesn't stop The Strokes from indulging in a bit of experimentation, like the title track or the ghostly falsetto on \\"Call It Fate Call It Karma.\\" (Somebody's been listening to their old Iron and Wine albums...) \\"Comedown Machine\\" is a fun album from a band that has gotten old enough to have lost that early exuberance, but not too old to settle for a conformist view of album making.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|SUCH A GREAT SHOW. One of my favorites. The acting, the story lines, the costumes and setting are wonderful!  Great entertainment, I'm addicted.
B00B97SNJI|4.0|Does your definition of classic rock mean the likes of Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and the Eagles? If so, you're going to love the third album from Dawes. \\"Stories Don't End\\" exquisitely recreates the sound that used to be made by 'the mellow mafia,' with each song drenched in harmony, acoustic guitars and no overloading bombast to startle or shock you. It's breezy California rock that could have easily dropped in from the late 70's, and that is meant in a good way.<br /><br />Vocalist Taylor Goldsmith is often a dead ringer for Jackson Browne, in fact the title track could have easily been an outtake from any given 70's Browne album. They work up singer songwriter storytelling (the cover image is the band around a campfire, theatrically passing along some sort of legend in the dark), with songs like \\"From A Window Seat.\\" Following America from one side to the other, it's a chronicle of the country and its loner/losers from a tour plane and self-examination, and the disc's best song. But that doesn't even take into account just how good some of the other songs on \\"Stories\\" are. They blend jewel precise three part harmonies (the title track), wistful lyricism (\\"Just My Luck\\") and a sense of classic pop (\\"Hey Lover\\") into a seamless album.<br /><br />If you're nostalgic for the sounds that used to flow out of Laurel Canyon or just miss really well done singer-songwriter music in general, Dawes is just for you. They may be making throwback music, but theirs is not a nostalgic viewpoint. \\"Stories Don't End\\" is grounded in the here and now, and is a triumphant album to have in this decade.

Their delivery was almost two to three weeks early and everything was in perfect condition. This is by far the best experience I've had with amazon and I recommend getting your CPP from Japan Import
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A well told story of overcoming adversity. I enjoyed learning the meaning of all the different flowers. The story was, however, highly predictable. I would recommended this book as a quick, enjoyable read.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Good action movie. Bourne story just a teaser. Disappointing that Bourne series characters were even represented as they lead to unrealized expectations or anticipation. Like &#34;Iron Man Legacy&#34; with no Iron Man - maybe a photo, or Pepper Potts seen in a news clip. This story has the legs to stand on it's own.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was a very comforting read.  Basically, the author gives scientific proof of an afterlife.  It was all very methodical and organized, but also quite interesting.  It's great to have a medical professional's viewpoint on life after death.  My only complaint is that the author repeats himself throughout the book.  This book did affect me which I think was the point.

0618526412|2.0|Carson McCullers, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter<br /><br />Carson McCullers' debut novel continues to thrill readers, at least according to reviewers on Amazon, but I found this naive, simplistic and sentimental tract a bit of a bore. I totally agree with the Dubai Reader when she says `the plot is slow, tediously slow at times and I couldn't help but wonder what the point was to all these people wandering in and out of Singer's room.' Singer, by the way, is the deaf mute who listens to all the other carefully selected victims oppressed by society: a drunken labour agitator, a tomboy who dreams of getting a piano, a very observant cafe owner and an idealistic black doctor. The point is that only Singer listens, listens to all their troubles on behalf of the reader, who is expected to empathise.<br /><br />`The book makes for excellent discussion,' the same reader concedes, but is that the main aim of reading a novel? I read a novel in the first place to engage with the protagonist, to get inside the skull of another consciousness, to understand how it feels to be him or her. I do not want a novel that bores me with big issues, that presents types, counters to be moved around on a chess board: the handicapped, the drunk, the idealist, the informant, the outcast. McCullers picks her types and then pushes them into situations.  They are not interesting as persons in their own right.<br /><br />Much of the gushing response to this novel seems to derive from the author's `wonderful' writing, but not one of the reviewers on Amazon quotes a line from the book's banal and dreary prose. Another reader admits to not `feeling any empathy towards any of the characters.' Exactly!  And why?  Because the naivety of the young author is revealed in her simplistic internal monologues.  I wouldn't go so far as to say they all `talk' alike (Blount is given some remarkably cogent - but most unlikely - drink-inspired speeches). But on the whole both the language and the acts of all four major characters are stilted (Singer's hands always in his pockets, Copeland always discreetly spitting into his handkerchief).<br /><br />McCullers's prose for the most part is undistinguished and juvenile and it would be better had she retained her naive voice, for when she seeks to sway the reader she employs a ludicrously unconvincing bombast.  Thus Biff, the good drunkard: `in a swift radiance of illumination ... saw a glimpse of human struggle and of valour.  Of the endless fluid passage of humanity through endless time.  And of those who labour and of those who - one word - love.  His soul expanded.  For in him he felt a warning, a shaft of terror.  Between the two worlds he was suspended....The left eye delved narrowly into the past while the right eye gazed wise and affrighted into the future.'  You'd better believe it, but sadly I didn't.  I didn't trust the teller or the tale.ajor characters are stilted (Singer's hands always in his pockets, Copeland always discreetly spitting into his handkerchief).<br /><br />McCullers's prose for the most part is undistinguished and juvenile and it would be better had she retained her naive voice, for when she seeks to sway the reader she employs a ludicrously unconvincing bombast.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I happen to love that period, fiction and non-fiction so I loved it.  I thought it covered both the sweetness and innocense along with the horrible tragedies so it was a great balance.  I would love to see a sequel

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Unusual and complex characters, and a fascinating theme running through on the hidden meanings of flowers. I read it for a book club, not expecting to like it as much as I did. Now I want to give it to my daughters to read!
B00389123Y|5.0|The best written and understandable investment book written.  It is simple, straight forward and extremely powerful...  I wish I had read \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" when I was nineteen!  My advice to all young and beginning investors is to re-read this book ever year that you invest.  New insight will come to you and make you a sharper and better investor each time you read it.  It doesn't promise to make you rich.  It definitely will make you a better and smarter investor.

145210655X|5.0|The book was in excellent condition. It is beautifully illustrated and all around just super cute for anyone, but especially a treat for parents who love Star Wars.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This is a great movie.  And if you don't have the CD that goes with it... GET IT!  Love it!
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|Interesting to see the story thread picked up after several years.  The story line was a little weak and could have been a little more interesting.  It went slow in many areas, but if you are a fan of Mr. Big and Carrie, then you will want to watch this one too.
B00110K62U|5.0|Made my mom very happy. This is not the movie, but a video recording of it on stage in london, Which is what she wanted.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I always am sad she the season ends and can't wait for the next one.  Season 3 is excellent as were the first and second.  Some surprising twists and turns that had me yelling at the screen when they happened.  Wonderful acting and well written.  A must see!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love these DVDs.  I was hesitant buying this workout because I usually hate DVDs.  I find them too easy- or boring.  I have enjoyed Insanity and P90x but recently I went through a lazy phase and I stopped doing those DVDs all together.  While running outside and attempting to get back into Insanity shape- I looked into Jillian Michaels.  SOOO Glad I did.  They are quick workouts (which I need right now to motivate me to Just Do It)- they leave you tired, sweating, and honestly- it makes me long to work even harder.  They are a great workout in themselves for the days when you are tired.  They are a super workout for mornings before work... and they are a great way of feeling good throughout the day without spending hours in the gym.  I love it.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|I gave the one dressed in blue to my grandson for his first birthday and he loved carrying it around and playing with it. He would reach for it or ask for it when he wanted comfort. His sister came along 2 1/2 years later and when she was one I gave her a different doll, but all she wanted was her brothers. There were several tussles about who should have it so I finally just bought her the pink one and peace reigns, well in the doll area anyway. These dolls are a perfect size for little hands, the cloth body makes them very cuddley and the plastic head, arms and legs makes them very durable. No new grands anticipated, but you can be sure the next one will have it's own.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Kind of cool the way this story developed/ended. I figured the main character would end up with the girl and money but liked the way he did it all. Very suspenseful

B009O07NMA|5.0|Great music, great band.  I love hearing my little country boys singing this around the house - it plays constantly.  I love that we were able to get the CD for $2 more when we were just going to get the MP3.  Great deal.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful book. An easy and quick read. You won't be disappointed.  Much better than the movie. I loved the book!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book will keep you 'nose deep' until the end.  I wished it would have ended differently, but otherwise I wanted to walk around with a big sign encouraging everyone to read the book.  Gillian Flynn is AMAZING with the way she introduces the characters and their transition as the story goes on. I am happy I read this book and SOOOO look forward to indulging in her other books.  If you are looking for an interesting read with a twist and a humor-this is it!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|It's unlikely that they will ever make a movie like this again. OK, I'm a sucker for epic films. This is a fantastic film. As big as it can be. I loved it.<br />Yes, it is kinda long. You might want to watch this over a couple of nights. I can't imagine seeing this in a theater and sitting there for well over three hours. It should be rated PB-4.<br />It starts with a overture. How many films do that?<br />The picture quality on the Blu-ray is so excellent. Beautiful restoration.<br />The cast is also outstanding.<br />The best 10 bucks you'll spend this year.
B008VBYN80|3.0|It's a good game but I would enjoy it more if you didn't have to buy the upper end items with diamonds (real money). I gave it 3 stars because I had to start the game twice whenever I wanted to play because I clicked later when it asked for a review. I finally got irritated enough and left this review.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I hope JA writes a fourth. i have devoured all 3 of the Clifton Chronicles and enjoyed each and every one of them.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Honestly one of the most interesting documentaries ever made. And the extra footage of the guys getting together 25yrs years later is amazing. This is a must have.
B005F3DFXG|5.0|My son loves this video. He watches it over and over. It has good narration and a good story for young dinosaur enthusiasts.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This is without a doubt the best television series that i have ever seen.  The first season is a little slow but once you get into it, it's incredible.  You will gain a connection to the characters that makes you feel like you're actually in the show.  If you have never seen this before, you will know why it is so talked about.  Everything about this show is amazing
B00004YM0D|4.0|but she loves the movie and the soundtrack even more!<br /><br />I would leave more of these ratings if I wasn't told how many words I have to use
B0083SBMBM|5.0|this movie is excellent. great way to combine some of your favorite superheroes. hilarious moments here and there. i watched this movie 3 times.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|great movie i saw it on cable loved the music i got the cds from the movie the story of the movie was good great singers.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|how i describe this movie:<br />very interesting<br />absolutely disgusting<br />disturbing scenes will stick in your mind when you go to bed, if you watch this at night (i did)<br />the plot was well formulated but could have continued further. the movie ending fell a bit short in my opinion.
B006CHML4I|5.0|This is a very nice watch for $60.  It has a sweeping second hand, and the hands also glow in the dark.  The wristband is reinforced with leather, which was a nice touch.  The display back is nice as well.  The only minor annoyance that it is hard to set the day and date--it comes in Spanish and English, which seems a little off, and it makes setting the day a little more tedious.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I like playing this game. It is an enjoyable mind exercise, and a great puzzle challenge. I like the fast pace of this game.
B00785P2QC|3.0|If you like the old SIM city games the this is must have game could be better with some upgrades.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am ready to move on. Loved the concept and characters. Only slight technical thought: how did they power the sump pump in 17?  &#34;24 volts&#34; and how many amps = too many!
B00005JLR2|5.0|I happen to enjoy a lot of movies for kids when I'm in the mood to go back in time, but I think this movie is my absolute favorite for a 'cartoon' movie. For some reason, and I can't say I know why, this movie really takes me away from my troubles and makes me happy...it's just a good-mood movie. I'm a 'little girl' who happens to be just over 50 but I feel like there's something special about this movie...it gives my heart a warm fuzzy feeling like when I was young and watched the best cartoons on Saturday mornings. I wish I knew why...it could be the music because I really love the songs on the soundtrack. For whatever reason...it's great for a cozy weekend alone at home. This cute movie makes me smile.
B008Y73940|3.0|I like Matthew McConaughey in most everything.  This movie was fast paced and had a lot of twists to make it interesting.  The outcome was predictable, however.
B000SEH80I|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is haunted by childhood memories and traumas perpetrated by your parents, that affect you as an adult. I wish we could all forgive and forget because life would be more simple, but sometimes life is not at all simple, and sometimes parents are not only imperfect but downright destructive to their children, which causes problems in our adult lives as well. This book doesn't solve all those problems, but it gets to the heart of things, and I am glad to have read it. I feel less alone in my struggles.
B000002MG1|4.0|R.E.M. set out to make album filled with guitar driven rockers and came up with this instead.  It's filled with slow tempo ballads delivered in Michael Stipe's unique style.<br /><br />I'm not much of an R.E.M. fan; and this is too slow throughout for my tastes to be one of my favorite albums, but it is worth the listen.  It's R.E.M. at their most confident and features what they do best.
B005BZQS1E|1.0|After watching the trailer, I thought this would be a good comedy. After watching the movie, I felt deceived.  This movie was predominantly about sex, foul language, and bloody fight scenes.  I did not laugh once!
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this album!! This band keeps getting better and better with every new album. 'Ain't It Fun' is my favorite song on the album but all the songs are amazing!!
B008I3RARW|5.0|this game keeps my son entertain while we are running errands... love how the game is interactive as well so it keeps him on his toes when playing.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is a very enjoyable, fast paced book! I am very impressed, and can't wait to read the next book in the series!
B0089EHWQE|3.0|I felt that there were too many &#34;actions&#34; that were placed in the storyline just to fill space.<br />The story was predictable,but I enjoyed the ending.
B000ZM1FXO|3.0|I had heard over the years about this movie but truly not good quality and I was not impressed by this at all.
B005DEVGFG|3.0|I somehow remember this band being a lot better when I was younger.  They have amazing skills and ability,  but the songs and albums don't come together in a creative and cohesive way. From a technical standpoint, this box set is amazing.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|Loved the songs. Loved the plot.  We need more movies like this in 2014.  Its too bad rick moranis has retired from show business.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2, and Temple Run are great games, very addictive. Get it if you can.  My 6 year old loves it too!
B003V5ED7W|5.0|John Candy at his best!  This world needs more humor like Candy's--simple, healing, laughter!  We miss you John--thank you for leaving us with your talented gifts--you are still bringing us smiles and happiness!
B00A757EFW|2.0|This is a fun game, but it will not let you play very long.  It isn't a full game.  You have to pay for the full version.
B005K15XR4|5.0|Fantastic music all on one album.  Found TSFH when used as background for a youtube video from The Hobbit.  Fell in love with their unique sound.  Now I realize I have been listening to them many times on trailers and games.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was chosen by my book club and I was anxious to read it as I am an avid gardener.  To my surprise this book was so much more!  Information on flowers was intertwined with a very well written story.  I would read it on my iPad while I exercised on the treadmill.  Loved it so much, I lost weight as I could not put it down!  Highly recommend it---
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again and find something new that I had missed before.  Story is timeless.  Grew up reading Tolkien and cheers to Peter Jackson for not only using the material from The Hobbit but also bringin in the background story that Tolkien never had a chance to do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't want to read this book because of the premise, but it was fantastic. I couldn't put it down. As soon as I finished it, I loaded Catching Fire on my Kindle so I could continue!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Works great, never crashes, and has all the features I'd want.  I'm a leftie, and this program even accommodates my leftie-ness.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />The introduction of Michonne and the reintroduction of Merle really drove the character-driven aspect of this season's plot. Aside from that, pretty much everything is better about season 3.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't wait for the upcoming update :) this game is fun for everyone I know me and my talk about this all the time and parents are fine with it because there is no blood or Gore (I don't know how to spell that)
B0002KQNJU|4.0|My husband had me purchase 2 of these movies, one for him, and one for his sister.  I guess this movie brought back some memories from their childhood!  Both of them very happy with the purchase.  I haven't watched the movie yet and it doesn't seem to interest me right now but my husband likes it!!!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Its a good movie.  Liam is pretty hot.  Bad things can and do happen, while traveling abroad.  People go on vacation, they pack everything they need, except their common sense.  They leave their brains @ home.  Think safety people!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best time waster yet. It gets really fun when you get andpast the 30x multiplier and start getting all the cool prizes.
B001NI24OI|4.0|The author of Friday Night Lights had his life threatened after the book was published. The book focused on the racial and irrational reverence to Permian football.  The movie, to me, was a typical story of high school drama on the field. The Producers of the movie had to alter the content to soothe the anger of the Odessa crazies.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Good book... I guess. Needed more happy moments. What happened in the ending should have started muchhh sooner. Still have some unresolved questions and feelings. Read at your own risk!<br /><br />Only read it though if you need to see the conclusion... don't bother if you don't really care!
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|IN my search for a working knowledge of quantum physics,biology, and brain function, this book seems to have it all. The author has been in this field for &#34;years&#34; and to really understand (as best you can), reading and rereading may be necessary. I am ready to restart with a bit of a foundation.
0073398101|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of the best aerodynamics books for aeronautical engineering students, expensive...but it worth ir very much
B00AKFG15S|3.0|The abrupt ending was annoying.  But I can't wait for the next episode.  I had the feeling that Mr Archer had a deadline to meet and just ended it right there
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great show and the streaming via Prime via Roku has been easy and fast. It's also convenient to have this available when traveling.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|my 4 year old absolutely loves this game because its very similar to Mario brothers and its very easy to use!
B007JMW46U|4.0|I'm not done with yet but it's a classic story and it was easy to download onto my Kindle Fire.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Well written, a real insight into the life of the English, and its countryside,but don't expect to be cheered up.
B000FA675C|3.0|There was lots and lots and lots of hype about this book and after reading I can say I enjoyed it but it did not live up to all the hype.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I think I've tried a couple dozen 'builder' apps ('build a city', 'build a zoo', 'build a farm', etc.) to for the most part be disappointed. After completing the tutorial introduction the game tries to charm you into handing over your credit card number to use real money to purchase anything extraordinary and then abusing (I mean recruiting) friends to do the same. On first glance I thought Dragonvale was another of these games. But, as I continued to play, I discovered that you don't need to pony up any money or harass anyone online. Just about all of the content is unlockable through good old patience.<br /><br />To break it down, you are building essentially a zoo for dragons. Basic elemental dragons (plant, earth, fire, cold, lightning, water, air, metal) can be purchased with coins. Coins are earned by visitors coming to your park. You can use coins to buy more land, habitats for dragons, decorations and farms to grow treats. Treats make your dragons level up and earn more money. Basic dragons can be bred into crossbreed dragons, which can only otherwise be bought with gems (which you buy with real money). So if you are patient you never have to spend any money at all. The waiting and collecting is the real fun of the game, afterall, so hurrying it up ruins the experience. Most of the dragons are quite cute and grow from babies to adults. It reminds me of the 'gotta catch them all' quality of Pokemon without the battles.<br /><br />So, while you can't sit and play Dragonvale for hours on end, it's fun to log in every so often, waste some time build your park and see what combination of dragons you can breed.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Argo is a great movie!  If you love history I think you'll enjoy this.  If you don't I think you can enjoy this on it's entertainment value alone.  I rented this on Amazon Prime and the streaming was a bit choppy and I had to restart it once.
B00C5ZORES|2.0|The fact that FOB after this will still be considered a 'rock' band is ludicrous. This is the same as the terrible overplayed garbage they play all day on KISS FM, with no soul or lyrics, just beats everywhere. This album isn't inherently bad stylistically if you wanted a pop album, but for long time fans of this band (which I would consider myself to be casually since I own 3-4 previous albums), this album is a major disappointment. Sometimes a hiatus makes bands stronger, but I am not really seeing it here with FOB.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I bought this and love the movie. I thought that the ultraviolet code that came with it would work in Canada, but it didn't. I'd used them before with no problems. I guess the problem came from the fact that this was bought in the US from Amazon.com, so that's probably why.... but it was unexpected ;-)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Never a dull moment at Lockhart Gardner! Great cast and storyline. I started watching during the end of the 2nd season on TV. After catching up with the 1st season, everything made sense.
0062119044|5.0|Highly recommend the book & the movie but would see the film first. I like to see the film first because then as I read the book I can more easily visualize the characters of the book as I'm reading along. Both are excellent for each of their mediums. The film is vague about possible explanations for why Kevin is such a psychopath & why mother seems to feel so much guilt about his murderous behavior, but the book comes closer to answering a lot of questions though it really can't explain such an inexplicable act as homicide of innocent people. The book has much more time to tell the story of Eva's life before Kevin, and thus we know much more about her as a person. Lionel Shriver writes with wit and precision. The characters are very well drawn and completely believable. She unfolds the story without too much foreshadowing, and at just the right pace. I conclude that Kevin would have been Kevin regardless of how well parented he was. I believe that these kind of psychopaths are born, not made. It's always difficult viewing an issue in the polar opposite way from your partner, but it must be a doubly miserable experience being in a marriage with a partner who sees the child you both conceived as just a wonderful, average, normal kid when you know in your heart of hearts that they are only seeing the child's mask. This book made me want to read more of Shriver's books.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but glad I didn't go to the theatre to see it. I think it was not exactly what I expected.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Spellbinding, well written and well filmed. A long glimpse into a society which had to change itself or die. And many of the issues raised are still relevant today. I highly recommend.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|The book is all about a history with no ending. The characters are cancer kids trying to be happy, that is the good part, the book itself lacks of strength. I did not like it. I would like to have my money back!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|one thing I hate about this game is that if u have to reinstall it, it starts u over from the beginning but other than that its great
B008XGML5U|3.0|This collection matters more for collectors than for those mad passionate about two legends of Rock and Roll. Ah well.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|We had this movie on our Netflix queue. We got it primarily because it was directed by Clint Eastwood, and I almost always like the movies he directs. I must admit that I was skeptical about this movie when I read the description, mainly because one of the main characters is a psychic. I'm not really a believer in that kind of stuff, but yet this movie was still very entertaining to me. There was actually a scientific explanation of why the psychic character had his abilities, which was interesting.<br /><br />I really liked how the movie consists of three separate stories of different people going through struggles related to death. The character development was excellent, and I also liked how the three different characters the movie follows were located in different parts of the world.<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, but know that the ending wraps up the stories in a very satisfying way for the watcher. This was a movie that I was pleasantly surprised by, which is why I felt compelled to write this review. Hope this helps!
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Great older movie, kept you wanting to watch it all the way through .. Really enjoyed would recommend to anyone
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Lots of action but as usual the payoff lacks teeth as if N D is afraid of offending somebody by ruining their day. Nevertheless it was an easy read and like most action flicks easily forgettable.  I can't wait for his next book
B003LQMZS0|5.0|This is a great addition to any play gym, stroller or car seat. I bought it when he was 4 months old and now at 8 months he's still playing with it.
1451613512|3.0|Stone's history focuses, like Howard Zinn, on the injustice that has characterized much of our political history.  This is a wholly worthy undertaking.  But at times, an appreciation of contemporary conditions seems to be lacking.  For instance, the decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan is regarded as primarily a message to the Soviets, not an honestly perceived military necessity.  The US since 1945 has indeed acted stupidly, greedily, imperially, and unjustly, but we simultaneously removed Jim Crow, fought unsuccessfully against poverty, educated a generation of WWII veterans, made strides to safeguard the environment and protested Vietnam and Iraq wars.  The American glass was close to half fill when it came to fulfilling our promise as a nation, but also definitely half empty.  I liked the emphasis on Henry Wallace and his foresight and sense of decency, but thought the book undervalued Eisenhower's counterweight to the McCarthy and Nixonian influences in his own party.  All in all, I knew most of what the book contained, except the material on Henry Wallace.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This was over 2 hours long and I still don't get the point of this movie. I thought it was just me, but after reading the reviews I don't feel so \\"out of the loop.\\" I was hoping for a funny comedy about turning 40, etc. This movie had a very strange tone to it. Didn't \\"flow\\" well like a normal movie or comedy. Scenes were just left cut off as to be unclear about how it should be left. Do I laugh, do I cry, or do I sit there confused is how I pondered this movie while watching it. Save yourself 2hrs of your life and watch something else. Not at all what I expected. I had the same thought when I watched \\"Hope Springs\\" and the new movie \\"Bachelorette.\\" Basically, this was just a movie about a bad, depressing marriage, just like Hope Springs (which is fine but at least make it funny!). Instead, I sat there thinking \\"huh?\\". This movie was nothing but bad fighting between the husband and wife and their kids. I didn't really want to watch 2 hours of a domestic dispute. I don't consider my self a prude, but the \\"F\\" word was dropped about 30 times in this movie, depicting the spousal fights and also the 13 year old daughter cursing like a sailor in the movie saying the \\"F\\" word! I don't believe we should glamorize nasty spousal fights and young children using horrible language. Just a poor movie all together.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|simple with large number/signs. overall a good app for everyday calculations. I use it often because its more accessible and easier to use than my phone.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love having the weather at the fingertips and also the ability to check other sites as well. This is very helpful.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Unique style holds your attention. Funny, witty, smart. I liked the film a lot.  Not for young children. Images of smoking and animal death may put some people off.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've torn through this collection twice now, along with the following series &#34;SHIFT&#34;, and can't get enough. The characters entrance you, the story engrosses you, and even though I know where it's going I can't stop reading.<br /><br />Hugh, I know you read these, so get &#34;DUST&#34; going soon. I'm begging you. Keep us updated on Facebook!
B004XANKVO|5.0|The bag is awesome. It is very well thought out with all the compartments that I need.<br /><br />It is almost too big. I love it for a daily bag, I just wish I could fill it up with enough stuff to make it seem worthwhile.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Is a protective device that not only look's good but is a great way to carry your kindle when out and about,
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I was riveted by the entire story from beginning to end.  The characters,  complex narrative, and scope was breath taking.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Watch the &#34;Firefly&#34; TV series first before watching this movie, but if you're looking at buying this you're probably already aware of the show.<br /><br />Awesome TV series that shouldn't have been cancelled so early, but I think it's fortunate that a movie was made to bring the series to a conclusion.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This game is no fun it is way to easy. There is no challenge at all.If you play it a couple of times. I found it to be boring.<br />The graphics are ok. The game is a snooze.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Awesome TV series that shouldn't have been cancelled so early, but I think it's fortunate that a movie was made to bring the series to a conclusion.  When you're done with the series, watch the movie &#34;Serenity&#34;.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Enjoying the DVD even thought I have 2 now but still will share with family and friends, I am sure they will be excited to see it as well.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Viking season one is pretty good. The narrative plot is interesting, and it doesn't have a ton of unneeded violence.  I couldn't really ever shake the feeling that I was watching Sons of Anarchy without motorcycles.  Some plot devices are also rather obvious, like you can see stuff coming a mile away.  I cannot stand the Floki character and the actors are really mostly character actors.<br /><br />In spite of all that it's pretty enjoyable.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Um... this album has been around forever... we all know how good it is... so yeah its awesome. You should listen to the samples and buy it... don't download it for free... because its worth the purchase.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The Hobbit was a short story but this movie, the first volume of two, fleshes out the story. While not true Tolkien, the lore is there. I loved all of the characters. Can't wait for volume two!
0553801473|5.0|this was just as in gauging as before I read prior I just wonder how long this I got is going to go on themes how it's really a TV  show being written into a book.
030758836X|3.0|A Psychological Thriller where the protagonist is easy to love and easy to hate. You get a roller coaster ride of her psyche right along beside her with twists that reach the depths of insanity. Amy is dead. Murdered by the hand of her handsome, broke, cheating husband or someone with a more sinister reason? By page 32 I was bored but determined not to feel a sense of buyers remorse and give this 100 pages to capture me. Page 101, I had to check previous reviews to make sure I wasn't reading a romance novel by mistake.Midway, Part Two, I was hooked and loving poor Amazing Amy only to soon hate her beyond belief.<br />The author does a wonderful job of scene setting description but lacks in secondary character development.<br />No spoilers here, the ending is something you would never expect and you will close the book either angry or thankful for the ride.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a real as it gets. Chris Kyle pulled no punches in this book. Most enjoyable read, highly recommended
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series, best series on and I love that I was able to buy it on amazon because I don't have cable at the moment!!! Loved not having to wait for the season to be over!! :)
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read! I felt all of Alice's events with her!  Great read!!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I enjoyed watching this season just as much as the first one thier the best around i cant wait for season 3
B00005Y23E|5.0|This CD is a must have if you are into Bob Marley or just plain Jamaican Music.  I am a Bob Marley fan, I brought two of them.  One for the Car CD player and one for home.<br /><br />Great buy!  Get the Deluxe Edition if you purchase the CD.  So much better.  Two versions of his most popular hits.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This is a great game, all my kids love to plsy it, from my 22 ýear old college student to my three great old.  Great game
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this book so much!  I read it, then read the rest of the series... then started over with Beautiful Creatures again, in case I missed something!  It is a for sure MUST READ! &#60;3
B008D28HYS|5.0|It took me over 7 1/2 months to finish this game, and I enjoyed every moment of it!  Keep the updates coming!
B000FA675C|5.0|Gabbed me and never let go, read this first a long time ago before a movie, etc. Amazing books all of them!
B004M9AS3Y|5.0|I was looking for a camera bag that offered protection, was light enough to be a day pack, and something to hold my electronics on my travels.  Bingo! this met all of my need and has a small \\"footprint\\".  When I'm not carrying my camera (Sony NEX-5n & lens) I'm traveling with Macbook, 7inch tablet, phone accessories.  It will hold ALL these or some without needing expansion and is still maintains it's compact look.  A huge plus with this bag is the strap that goes around the handle on your roll a board bag so you don't have to carry your electronics \\"laden\\" bag.  A great bag for the weekly traveler that is a camera enthusiast.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started off very interesting.  Got a bit tedious as the &#34;crime&#34; was being solved.  Still a good, quick read for a rainy weekend.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|I love that records are making a come back.  When listening to this record I could not even tell it was a record the sound was so crisp and clean.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This stuff works!  Just buy it and don't sweat the details.  My only complaint is the amount you get for what you pay. 3.5g isn't much; however, you really don't need much between your heatsink and chip because this stuff does what it advertises.
032147404X|5.0|The book is exactly what I was looking for and it is written in an entertaining and gripping manner. The author has gained my respect and I could not be more satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />Great author, really.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Very well written tale. James had such depth of character. I felt his pain and was moved to tears at his tortured childhood. It is so refreshing to read a story with a happy ending! I will be thinking about this for a long time.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|game is addictive. you got a few minutes to an hour game will have you hooked.<br />my only complaint is that the controls are unresponsive at times (tablet controls) but not bad. im still having fun playing the game and would suggest anyone to get it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Played this originally on the Nintendo ds.... now they came out with it on Kindle Fire!!  Too cool!!  was so excited to see it.... played all levels and bought the &#34;world pass&#34;.... ?? But I don't see any new worlds or levels ??  Anyway.... the game is the best, right up there with angry birds I'd say.
B009EFP278|4.0|Olly Murs makes his US debut with a bang. Right Place Right Time is a fun, carefree pop album free of all that generic pop crap that's popular now-a-days. Olly has a knack for making quality music while having a lot of mainstream appeal. Though the album didn't get a promotion in the US, this album really is a hidden Gem that all lovers of Pop music should give a shot.<br />The first thing immediately noticeable about Right Place Right Time is how incredibly catchy nearly every song is. This album somehow manages to get nearly all of the songs stuck in your head all at the same time after listening to it just once. The biggest single he released is \\"Troublemaker\\", the song has one of the most deadly catchy hooks that has been released in recent memory. The Flo Rida feature was okay, but mostly unneeded as he didn't really help or hurt the song by any means. His other single was \\"Heart Skips A Beat\\", another incredibly catchy song, that has a surprisingly catchy piano beat. The feature from Chiddy from Chiddy Bang was a lot better than the Flo Rida feature, as Chiddy manages to throw down some slick lines, adding a lot to the album.<br />Usually with albums like this, the artist releases the best song or two from the album leaving the rest feeling like filler after the album's release. This is absolutely not the case with Right Place Right Time. Listening through the album from the beginning to end, Olly manages to surprise you at nearly every corner with yet another infectious hook with a catchy beat.<br />Unfortunately this album isn't perfect. The song \\"Dance With Me Tonight\\" is a weird attempt at going retro. The song isn't really bad, but it's just kind of off putting. The hook isn't all that great and the beat isn't anything to run home about ether. My biggest gripe with the album is the song \\"Oh My Goodness\\". The song is just awkward. It doesn't feel like it's really going anywhere, and it just feels like a filler song.<br />As for the deluxe edition tracks. They're good, but the only ones that really feel like they could go into great territory is \\"One of These Days\\" and \\"I Need You Now\\". But even then, they sound a lot alike. I almost feel like the record label took those two off the standard version as an excuse to release a Deluxe Edition. It's not bad, but it just makes the album drag on longer than it should.<br />Right Place Right Time is a fantastic album. By no means is this an album that's going to go down in history as one of the greatest albums ever. But it's just a fun loving jaunt that lovers of mainstream music will really enjoy.<br /><br />FINAL SCORE: 8/10<br /><br />Must Have Tracks:<br />Troublemaker (Feat. Flo Rida)<br />Heart Skips A Beat (Feat. Chiddy Bang)<br />Right Place Right Time<br />Army Of Two<br />Loud & Clear
B005MMY9A8|3.0|It was a decent movie something to watch at least once. I would not purchase to own though. Not enough action although the fight scenes were good.
0425263908|2.0|I heard this was the next fifty shades trilogy.  While I expected it to be along the same lines as Fifty Shades I didnt think it would be almost the exact same book, right down to how things were described.  I was very disappointed.  I have not picked up the next book in this trilogy because I just don't think I can sit through another knock off..
B000005H7D|5.0|Its a great album (Two takes of Blue Train and Lazy bird), well worth it, If your a fan of Coltrane or jazz for that matter, cant go wrong!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and this book surprised me.  He can be a very predictable writer and while this book still follows his girl meets boy, boy and girl fall in love story line it has a twist that was unlike his other books.  I really liked it, it was a bit of a thriller.
0060873027|1.0|My husband and son-in-law tried to read this novel but it was so stupid they couldn't finish it.  Loose plot and no characterization.  Bad attempt.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great for all of us that grew up in arcades through the 80's and 90's and awesome for our children that really dig today's video games!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book is fun, pretty, exciting, funny, and inspiring. (I'm glad I have it in both kindle and hard copy formats.) 4-Hour Chef was a joy to read and I felt like I was going on an adventure with Tim. Sad it came to an end but my personal adventure continues as I experience my kitchen (and life) with new eyes.<br /><br />I picked up so many practical tips that I use daily in my kitchen now and happily recommend this book to everyone.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've ever seen and I watch a lot of television. Each season gets better and better. Oddly this season has better HD quality than the previous 3 I bought from amazon.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Although the performances in this movie are pretty good, sometimes the plot is a little hard to follow. Is is about the witness of a murder from the past, or is it about a murder in the present? Then there are the hallucinations! Maybe it was a better book, where you could re-read something again if you didn't catch it the first time. It'sstill a worthwhile movie to watch.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My wife and I looked so forward to watching an episode every night after work that we could hardly wait to get home.  Pour a glass of wine and sit back and prepare to be transported to another world!  The characters are so engaging...the scenery, the opulence, it's all so much fun you will forget about your own life for awhile.  We had to limit ourselves and savor each episode to make the season last longer.  The temptation is to watch the whole season at one sitting.  You won't be disappointed.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Django was true to form Tarantino - on steroids.  While it lacked the conversational panache of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs it gave the bloody punch of Kill Bill.  It had the pacing and feel to it reminiscent of O brother, Where art thou? - just add a lot more BLOOD.  I cannot imagine how many blood packets they went through in filming.  It is not for the faint of heart but, it's TARANTINO!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was so hooked I couldn't stop myself from watching the whole season great season big fan.  I have told all my like minded friends. sent my girlfriend running though her threshold for zombies is low
B003B02O7I|5.0|I love this story. Great read as usual from Grisham. At first when i started i was wondering where the story was going and I didn't put down the book until I read it all
0061714402|5.0|This book is excellent.  I am ploughing through it.  It is an absolute must for any heavy metal fan.  Intelligently written, a bit scandelous (Dave doesn't hold back with his subversive bashing), and very revealing about the metal scene in the late 80s.  Only halfway done...giving it Double Devil Horns already!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Loved it the music is great and I think gwyneth should look to recording her own country music album/ cd she is a great songstress especially when it comes to COUNTRY YEE HAW !!!!!!!

B008602KQI|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend who loves the Hunger Game series. For some reason she didn't want my pirated DVD-R version. &#34;it's not the same&#34; she says. Anyway, seller was awesome. Shipped and packaged well. Movie well... no comment on that.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|Wow. A new author to me, and one I'll read again. This book too, I will read again, and get a whispersync audible. The story drew me right in from the start, but kept surprising me, and drawing me on. It was satisfying to hear the dark or dreadful significances of some flowers as well as the brighter ones, and as nuanced as the language of flowers is, so is this novel.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|There were lots of twists and turns, and just when you thought you had it all figured out, there was another angle.  This is what I love
0553801473|5.0|Can't say enough for this series....I need to finish reading it before I can give it an adequate rating.  I gave it 5 stars because Mr. Martin has been consistent in keeping me enthralled with his writing.

B0094K1WZE|1.0|I tried to watch this but the reception was horrible--the film would literally stop and reload every 2 minutes. After about 10 minutes of this (I kept hoping it would finally get hold and keep going) I just exited out. I have no idea if the film itself is any good, since I was unable to watch it.  I hope that Amazon is able to fix whatever is wrong with their online film access at some time in the very near future.
B00BYH6OJO|3.0|I get a little bit tired of Hollywood thinking that for a movie to be good you have to put the F word in every other sentence.

B0076DEJMO|5.0|5 stars in every way, characters, plot, writing, and setting.  I am so impressed with Joe Abercrombie as being the best fantasy writer, best writer that has come along in a long time.  I eagerly look forward to his books and just wish he could write faster.

B00BK5D95C|5.0|I had been putting off getting into this band for awhile, but then the album went super cheap on Amazon and I bought it. I have the worst attention span for music probably ever, but this album has so many interesting things going on that I can listen to it all the way through and be eager to hear it again. Tessellate is the first song that got me hooked, but I find myself humming Matilda all the time now.  Every song is super weird, in the best way.
B0053R1QXU|5.0|Great film, great story, and great acting. I would recomend it to a friend. In addition, it has so many twist and turns it will definitely have u guessing.

B004I744AS|5.0|I like the fact that I can not only get the definition but the voice pronunciation is available also.  I certainly recommend it to anyone needing a quick and convenient dictionary.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|If you're a fan of zombies, this is a very good read.  The journalistic style it is written in is very engaging, and though a little wonky at times, keeps the pacing of the story true.  If you are planning on reading this, plan to read his other book The Zombie Survival Guide, as there are many thing explained in each book that don't make sense until you've read the other.  That alone is the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5.
B000000WCX|4.0|My first exposure with \\"Earthling\\" was while reading Home Theater magazine. The writer said that it was a love it or hate it album and he went on to describe what it was like listening to it thru speakers that cost more than most cars. I was intrigued by what he wrote. Then I bought Bowie's best of DVD. It had four videos on it from the album. These vids were the most awesome, hyper and dramatic of the whole package. I had to listen to the rest of the album. I had to buy it because I was wearing those four tracks out.<br /><br />Even though I had already heard nearly half the album I was still totally blown away by what I heard. I had never heard anything like it before. \\"Earthling\\" is one of those albums that when it is over you have nothing left to play, because nothing can match its intensity. You literally have to take a break from sound afterwards. At least until I discovered 1 Outside. The music is relentless. It is always attacking. The drums have been speed up to 160 beats per minute. There are no breathes to be taken here. Dynamic is the word that comes to mind. Sheer sonic dynamics come at you from all angles. In headphones it is utterly immersive. There is no escape.<br /><br />\\"Big screen dolls, ti ts and explosions<br />Sleepytime, Bashful but nude<br />Enter Galactic, see me to be you<br />It's all in the tablets, Sneezy Bhutan<br />Mars happy nation, sit on my karma<br />Dame meditation, take me away<br />Little wonder then, little wonder<br />You little wonder, little wonder you\\"<br /><br />`Little Wonder' starts us off at light speed. Seven Dwarves, crazy synthesizers and power drumming are at play here. Bowie says the album is a balance of atheism and Gnosticism. What I get out of it is that everything is so far away. Contained in its aural grasp is a reach for the unexplained. That to me is evident from the first song. We are reaching for the outer limits.<br /><br />\\"Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boyzone<br />Slim tie, Showdown, can't stop<br />(Satellite)<br />Where do we go to now?<br />There's nothing in our eyes<br />As lonely as a moon<br />Misty and far away\\"<br /><br />`Looking For Satellites' is made up of repetitive chanting and one of the most insane two minute guitar solos ever recorded. It is my favorite here. When I bought the album I would lye out on the balcony for hours and listen to it while looking up at the desert sky for UFO's. This song was perfect for the occasion. The head phones would be cranked up and many a time I would freak out as an airliner suddenly streaked into view burning up in a long flaming pyre. Of course those airliners would turn out to be shooting stars. But oh the fascination on first sight!<br /><br />\\"I got used to stressing pain<br />I used the sucker pills to pity for the self\\"<br /><br />I have no idea what this song is trying to say, but `Battle For Britain' blast out with keyboards scrapping and drums blazing. It has some spacious moments between the fast beats that lighten the load and lead into piano and a great short circuited break.<br /><br />\\"The stars look so special<br />And the snow looks so old<br />The frail form is drifting<br />Beyond the yoga zone\\"<br /><br />`Seven Years In Tibet'. Dying in a foreign place of beauty and given a second chance at life, a redemption. Power and grace at its upmost. Searing guitar and impassioned vocals as a slow steady beat gives way to crunching chords. Easily one of the greatest songs Bowie has ever done.<br /><br />\\"And I'm gone<br />Like I'm dancing on angels<br />And I'm gone through the crack in the past<br />An Alien Nation In Therapy \\"<br /><br />`Dead Man Walking'. Another song that shares the title of a movie, this dead man is walking FAST! Did I mention *Hyper*. Try to sit still during this one. Keyboard and drums have now taken our light speed and put it on warp drive. I think that is insane guitar we are hearing too. The solo at the end is typical of how twisted the whole thing is.<br /><br />\\"Gorgeousgirls are bound to meet<br />To talk of stars and kings and feet<br />Through the chromosomes of space and time\\"<br /><br />`Telling Lies' is another perfect one for star watching, as the hollowness and endlessness of space over our heads is captured in the echo of this tune. Speed drumming and super slow synth makes up most of this track and once again Bowie repeats the same vocals over and over. Bowie knows the government is lying about the aliens here on Earth with us. Here he feels like \\"something is going to happen this year\\". A month after the album's release a giant V flew across the state of Arizona. Blame Bowie for that.<br /><br />\\"Nobody laughs any more<br />It's the worst thing you can do\\"<br /><br />`The Last Thing You Should Do' is probably the worst song here, as it has nothing at all to say. But boy does it cook in its midsection.<br /><br />\\"Johnny looks up at the stars<br />Johnny combs his hair<br />And Johnny wants pus sy in cars\\"<br /><br />`I'm Afraid Of Americans' is of course the one most everyone has heard. Though tamer than some, it is very representative of what you find on the album. Heavy doses of drums and trash guitar combine with synthesizers to blast you out of any relaxing state you might have been in.<br /><br />\\"I don't want knowledge<br />I want certainty\\"<br /><br />`Law' is the album closer. It is weird to say the least. It may have been better as an instrumental. There is a lot of chanting here and repetitive lyrics which seem to have no meaning. It sounds like it was fun to record, but it seems like something better could have been achieved to end this fantastic album.<br /><br />For fans, few albums alienate like Earthling. But one thing is for certain here, Bowie is back and he is kicking butt.<br /><br />4.5 starsgirls are bound to meet<br />To talk of stars and kings and feet<br />Through the chromosomes of space and time\\"<br /><br />`Telling Lies' is another perfect one for star watching, as the hollowness and endlessness of space over our heads is captured in the echo of this tune.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|and then had to read the book.  It was a very enjoyable read, very close (in tone and content) to the film.  One of the rare cases where both film & book are excellent in their own right.  Recommended.
B0000C8AUO|4.0|The reality here is that Bowie seems comfortable again. This album is as polished as its predecessor but more upbeat. He said after 2002's \\"Heathen\\" that he found it fun to make albums again and could see himself making one a year, like in the old days. A heart attack stopped that, but in this recording it seems like we can sense his joy.<br /><br />`New Killer Star' starts off like a top spinning out of control. It's a cool rock song, upbeat and full of promise in a wicked world. Like the albums closer, this is one of his best songs in the past 30 years.<br /><br />`Pablo Picasso' starts out distorted and dizzy, like all of the crap that this BS artist Picasso created. The guy could not draw a fly if he had to. His sheep are the reason crap can be considered art. But the song is not bad.<br /><br />`Never Get Old' I never listen to, but others like it. About old age, it is just too dull for me. Maybe I refuse to face reality.<br /><br />`The Loneliest Guy' is slow and gloomy. It is about loss. The reality of when something cannot be undone. Bowie in denial, pretending he is lucky, when in reality; he was lucky, but no longer. It would fit right in on the \\"Hours\\" album.<br /><br />`Looking For Water' is a song with a driving beat that seems to cycle in on itself, with backing vocals repeating the same statement continuously through the song. It has a steady drive throughout which makes it one of the best rock songs on here.<br /><br />`She'll Drive The Big Car' is our story song, about an unhappily married woman having an affair. Life is not what she expected. Is it ever? She plays the wife and mother role, while wanting more and it is shown in how she listens to the radio while driving.<br /><br />`Days' is the softer song, which also sounds a lot like it could have been on \\"Hours\\". Except that it is lighter and freer flowing. I love you Tigger. I owe you. All the days of my life.<br /><br />`Fall Dog Bombs The Moon' is this albums totally catchy tune. You can hear it in your head long after playing. This up tempo number may leave you wondering what it is talking about, but the music comes easily, natural and effortless.<br /><br />`Reality' is the hardest song here, but not as drastic as many of those on \\"Outside\\" or \\"Earthling\\". It is another where the artist is grasping for water while the end is nigh.<br /><br />`Bring Me The Disco King' is bound to become Bowies late period signature song. It almost sounds hollow, as the experience seems to come from the hush between notes. This is a great singer singing his sign off number before the club closes and half the crowd is past out with cigs still burning. If Bowie had never made another song, the Disco King would have been a perfect ending to his career.<br /><br />4.5 Starsit in your head long after playing.

B00AFROVQC|4.0|I choose four stars because its better then a lot of other books out there and it takes a lot of thought to keep a reader interested in a book  the only thing I didn't like was that the book were so short  and yes I would tell my friends about these books if I had any  that like to read

B00AL6SM0S|5.0|I suspect that many, if not most, of the purchasers of this superb set will already have various recordings of the operas of Richard Wagner, with libretti and notes. However, that should not keep any serious opera lover---and certainly any lover of the music dramas of Wagner---away from this marvelous assembly of historic Metropolitan Opera performances.  What we have here are fine broadcast performances of nine major operas---25 CDs---of Wagner's maturity (missing only a PARSIFAL), ranging from a broadcast performance of GOTTERDAMMERUNG (Jan. 11, 1936) to a broadcast performance of TANNHAUSER (Jan. 9, 1954).<br /><br />The list includes:<br />FLIEGENDE HOLLAENDER (Dec. 30, 1950); F. Reiner, cond.; Hans Hotter, Astrid Varnay, Set Svanholm, Sven Nilsson.<br /><br />TANNHAUSER (Jan. 9, 1954); G. Szell, cond.; Ramon Vinay, Astrid Varnay, Margaret Harshaw, George London, Jerome Hines.<br /><br />LOHENGRIN ((Jan. 2, 1943); E. Leinsdorf, cond.; Lauritz Melchior, A. Varnay, Kerstin Thorborg, Alexander Sved, Norman Cordon.<br /><br />DAS RHEINGOLD (Jan. 27, 1951); Fritz Stiedry, cond.; Hans Hotter, Set Svanholm, Jerome Hines, Karin Branzell, Brian Sullivan.<br /><br />DIE WALKURE (Feb. 17, 1943); E. Leinsdorf, cond.; Melchior, Kirsten Flagstad, Marjorie Lawrence, Julius Huehn, Emmanuel List.<br /><br />SIEGFRIED (Jan. 30, 1937); Artur Bodanzky, cond.; Melchior, Flagstad, Friedrich Schorr, E. List, Kerstin Thorborg.<br /><br />GOTTERDAMMERUNG (Jan. 11, 1936); A. Bodanzky, cond.; Melchior, M. Lawrence, Ludwig Hoffmann, F. Schorr.<br /><br />TRISTAN UND ISOLDE (April 16, 1938); A. Bodanzky, cond.; Melchior, Flagstad, L. Hoffmann, J. Huehn, K. Branzell.<br /><br />DIE MEISTERSINGER VON NURNBERG (Jan. 10, 1953) Reiner, cond.; Paul Schoeffler, Victoria de los Angeles, Hans Hopf, Gerhard Pechner.<br /><br />The performances are, it must be said, self-recommending. Several of these historic performances may be the very best EVER. I would mention in this category the illusive April 16, 1938, TRISTAN. I've never seen a CD incarnation of this performance (I have a tape, but only in so-so sound). Yet, as Paul Jackson states in his first volume of analysis of historic Met broadcasts, it is undoubtedly the best pairing of the two Wagner giants of the 1930s and '40s: Melchior and Flagstad. It is, very simply, superb in every way, and, indeed, were it the ONLY release available at the very reasonable price for this entire set, it would be worth it.<br /><br />Then, there is the February 17, 1940, WALKURE, with Marjorie Lawrence, Flagstad, Melchior, Huehn, all under a young Erich Leinsdorf. Copies of this performance have circulated for years, available via various private labels like Myto and Walhall. But here you have a careful reproduction of the Met archive copy. Along with the 1962 Nilsson-Bohm collaboration and the Furtwanger commercial, this may well be the most important WALKURE issue available: it certainly demonstrates how Wagner COULD and should be sung. Melchior, Flagstad, and Lawrence---indeed, everyone that Saturday afternoon---were in top form.<br /><br />At the outset, I wondered why Sony and the Met chose to include the 1954 TANNHAUSER and the 1953 MEISTERSINGER. Indeed, why the 1951 RHEINGOLD, when the classic one from the 1930s was around? But in listening to these performances, each one had something special to recommend it, whether the superb vocalism of Hans Hotter, the sonorous music-making of Paul Schoeffler, or the unmatched bass-baritone of George London. And then, there as the conducting of such greats as Reiner and Szell.<br /><br />In each case, I went back to Paul Jackson's detailed commentary on historic Met broadcasts, and then, listened to the performance. There is not a single miss in this box. And more, in extending the reach into the 1950s (a time when Wagner singing at the Met became a bit less inspiring), this collection reminded me that there were, indeed, some high points, some fine singers, and that they, too,should be included in any anthology documenting the period.<br /><br />Sony has given us a sturdy, pop-top, cardboard box, with individual cardboard gatefold containers for each opera. There is a fine, well-illustrated 128 page book that accompanies the set. I would think that anyone acquiring it would already have libretti--there is none included. No problem.<br /><br />The restoration work appears very good and clean. Although I've not finished listening to all the works yet, what I have heard suggests careful restoration and preparation.<br /><br />In short, given the contents--of extreme historical and music importance---and the price, and what this means to our understanding of musical art from the 1930s-1950s, this is a self-recommending set that no genuine lover of Wagner, or, for that matter, of great music, should be without.should be included in any anthology documenting the period.<br /><br />Sony has given us a sturdy, pop-top, cardboard box, with individual cardboard gatefold containers for each opera.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I've played a few spider solitaire games, and this one is my favorite, because it has tons of options. You can pick whether to be able to undo after you flip over new card stock, you can pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 suits, and you can pick whether or not a tableau needs to be filled before you can deal another stock. It works really well on a mobile device, and rotation works well, too.<br /><br />There are ads, but they're not too bad. And, I wish they came up with a better scoring besides fewest moves, because the games that require the most intelligence are the games with the most moves. And, that's why I like spider solitaire, because it's the solitaire game that requires the most thinking and the most smarts. I think you'll like it, too.

B0010AN7Z4|5.0|A classic, wonderful movie that has been beautifully restored and transfered.  Really cool extras including an extremely informative commentary about all aspects of the movie. Technical and script notes that are very interesting.  A good buy.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I gave this book four stars.  Though I enjoyed it, it was predictable when you got 75% finished.  I would recommend if you want something quick, easy, and not difficult.  There are ZERO surprises or twists in the story, again, predictable.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I have Seasons 1 and 2 and will soon purchase Season 3, but will not pay $10 extra for Blu-ray on this one.
B000FA675C|5.0|Took me a while to get around to reading the book, but i'm glad that i did. I found it to be much better than the movie, and will be reading the rest of Dan Browns books shortly.
B00A83075M|4.0|This was a cute movie.  The beginning was very entertaining and somewhere along the way it just became a kids oriented movie but overall it was cute.
B00867GHS8|4.0|This is such a cute movie. My kids have watched it many times throughout the years - from young kids to teenage years. My less than perfect rating is based on the most expensive 3D collector set received having a very crooked Holographic picture on the front. It is glued on so trying to straighten it may rip the sleeve. Surely no big deal to most but visually disturbing like a crooked picture you just want to straighten.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Awsome overall concert. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it is in full screen oppose to widescreen format.
0007152590|5.0|I have read and re-read this wonderful and  helpful book many times!!  The truth that it imparts is not easy to implement,  but small changes and steps can make an enormous difference in a relationship.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use especially with favorites. One touch access to radar maps and extended forecasts. This app is very useful while traveling.
0385349947|5.0|When I read to page 34, I stopped reading.  I hopped back on Amazon and ordered copies for the managers in my office.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It has so many options, including music which is perfect for me and math problems if you're into that?.. Great app overall. It is so good that I even took the time to write a review!
0767836286|5.0|I have seen this movie years ago and knew I had to have it as part of my collection. Very good movie overall and Tim Robbins was convincing as a terrorist.
B007UK83S4|5.0|Still feeling burnt after reading the awful' Waging Heavy Peace' by Neil Young I wasn't sure if I wanted to read another rock star biography for a while. Another concern for me was that when I have watched Pete Townshend in interviews I have found it difficult to relate or be excited by him - often passing him of as a prat (Sorry Pete). My opinions have changed and I feel I understand and ADMIRE Pete Townshend as an ARTIST. The book is informative, interesting, exciting and reads better than most biographies that are just a collection of anecdotes for transpotters. 'Who I Am' offers so much more. Its also a very personal story and I imagine it was a carthartic experience for the author.  It also made me listen to the back catalogue of Cds again (Group and Solo) with new understanding. You dont have to be an avid Who fan to enjoy the book and it defintly deserves its five stars!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great for the gym! The normal earbuds don't fit well in my ears so these are perfect. Lightweight and comfortable.
B008602KQI|5.0|Set in the post apocalyptic future (what youth oriented book or movie isn't these days), the characters are engaging and interesting.  Even the manipulative governing adults have a point of view that is understandable though not one most of us would identify with.  And all seem to have an uneasy feeling that the way things are is not the way things should be.  A good initial movie in a series that should take the reader/viewer in interesting directions.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I really like the notes feature.  This makes playing Sudoku easy and fun.  I don't think I'll ever run out of puzzles either.
0890090572|2.0|The contents of course being the stories of Conan Doyle on Sherlock Holmes are excellent, but the book itself was a disappointment. There was no jacket cover and the binding was torn. I could have had a number of other choices that would have been so much better.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|not a fan of running out of lives, but it keeps me from wasting even more time on my kindle fire, great game for killing time which is why I got the game,
B0029ATTAQ|4.0|Scary stuff here with a movie filmed in London in 1984 showing just what life will become if we don't start controlling our politicians. Great final acting roll from Richaard Burton.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love this one.  I am willing to pay a buck to stop those stupid ads. finally one that is way. smoother
B00AYATBP6|3.0|Purchased to use in by house, the amount of oil they consume is more expensive than electricity. Still, a nice touch on the dining table.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Came across Rodriguez through the documentary, &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;. Interesting story, interesting artist. I don't understand why this album failed in the US, this was the music of that time.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|My family and I enjoyed  this movie over and over again. I enjoyed the story and the realness of it.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|I've seen Rodriguez on a few TV shows performing recently. This music holds up well. Great music for cruising down the highway
B00571F26Y|4.0|Gets you thinking about wheat and how it impacts your body. This book has a fair amount of endocrine references. Really enjoyed how the book starts off simple. Been gluten-free 3/4 meals per day and noticed an average weight loss of 3-5 pounds. (I weighed myself after 3 weeks of this new diet) When you go completely gluten-free for the first 2-3 days, you will notice stomach fat shrinkage.  Keep in mind I'm 5' 11\\" 155lbs. I workout 2-3 times a week. The best part of this gluten-free diet is I lose visceral (stomach) fat without trying at the gym. Along with my green smoothies and a gluten-free perspective, I am becoming more raw-food centric.<br /><br />Stop consuming wheat so much and preserve your pancreas by keeping those beta (insulin) cells healthy for the long term, which can minimize your chances of insulin resistance.
B0026SCMNM|2.0|THe book was very slow moving and the main character seemed to be weak and indecisive.  Everyone around her seemed to make all of the decisions--while she just went along thru life.  we were left hanging with many questions.  Our book club read it and we all agreed that it was not a great read!!
0802473156|5.0|I gave this book as a gift to my grown son to give him some additional insight on people he will encounter in life
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I could not get my waist line to where i wanted without losing upper body size on a typical 6 meal a day high protein diet with oatmeal or brown rice as my main carbs.  The slow carb diet is a big step up....lost 2 waist line inches in 10 days so far.  The weight lifting method takes far less time in the gym and is working so far and takes a bit of time to adjust to....i love this approach
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is written so wonderfully, it's actually kind of hard for me to explain. I laughed out loud, gasped, and cried, and it was all in one amazingly written, immensely captivating book. It is definitely, definitely now one of my top five books.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I have the regular and extended editions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and absolutely love them.  But The Hobbit was wonderful.  The Hobbit was above and beyond the LOTR trilogy.  I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.  Loved it!!!
0446691437|5.0|One of the best books of its kind, for inspiring those wanting to pursue a new venture or artistic endeavor in life. An important teacher of mine recommended this book, and since reading it I also gave it to two other important individuals in my life as a gift. It's important for any aspiring artist to read, and it's also useful as a self help guide and manual of living life with courage and going after what you truly want in life.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Couldn't put it down! I fell in love with almost every character in this book and didn't want it to end. The writing was superb & this is a book I will read again!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Possibly getting too twisted but I still love it and Victoria and Erica's wardrobes are amazing . Cantvwaitvti see season three.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|A holiday classic. This is some of the best animation I've ever seen. I always loved the book with it's great story and illustrations. The best part of this movie, to me, is the train skidding along the frozen lake!
B000SEIDR0|5.0|As someone who lived on a farm and who grew up in a farming community, I was spellbound by this book.  It is an accurate historical representation of the changes in agricultural practices that have taken place from my grandparents' generation to the present time - a relatively short period in human history.  While reading Mr. Pollan's chapters on corn, and then later on grass pasture farming, I found myself agreeing out loud, over and over again.  He tells the truth.<br /><br />I live in south central Michigan, in a place where 13 CAFOs have settled since 2000.  The stench, the well-documented environmental degradation in air, soil, and water quality, and the treatment of animals is even worse than presented in this book.  There is no excuse, no justification possible, for these facilities and the commodity farming that supports them, except greed.  It is beyond horrible; I see it every day.  I say this as an old farmer, and as someone who loves farming and knows its value.<br /><br />I think this book should be required reading for everyone who eats and drinks.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This is an annual classic in my family. I've watched it year after year and never tire of it. Excellent!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|One day I had homework that had fractions. It said I could use a calculator so,I asked my dad for a calculator that had fractions. He said that we did not have any. So I went looking for a fraction calculator and finally found this one. I was so happy. I would definitely recommend this app.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I didn't really want to watch this movie when my sister brought it over to me.......I was playing on my IPad when it first started and then before I knew it I had put down my IPad and was totally engrossed in the movie. Its a wonderful story (and true at that!).  Anyone who is a real animal lover or who likes to watch movies where you see the &#34;animals feelings&#34;  come out through the movie will love this one.....! I went out the next day and bought it!
0292701934|5.0|I'm a big fan of Avedon, and always wandered how he managed the relation with the subjects, how he was approaching them, the distance between the camera, the subject and the photographer.<br />It's a really good book, with astonishing picture from Avedon assistents.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Exactly as needed and described. Happy customer! Fast, easy, arrived on time, packaged perfectly safe. No problems what so ever.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|My produce arrived quickly and was exactly as described by the buyer. Thanks so much!!! This is the place to buy dvd's!
B005Y9B5UG|5.0|I don't usually buy dvd's these days, since everything is online or on Netflix but this dvd was really worth buying. I loved Shakira's performances, she is really a great entertainer. There was music, dancing, etc. Can't wait to go to her next concert.
1401322786|5.0|A thought-provoking lesson on the value of time and how you should treasure the moments of your life and the people who share it with you.  Wonderful story!
B009EEMMWW|5.0|This is a sexy performance mixed with a little drama and lots of magic between a spicy chef, her husband and her love interests.  It is quite entertaining.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|I'm not sure I believe all the stories, but 3/4 of the book was an interesting read.  The last half is more just page fillers.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|If this holds true, and no 2-D with a 3-D version is released, it will make my mind up not to purchase a 3-D TV.  As it is, most dramas and the majority of movies are not 3-D nor do I think they ever will be as it does not make sense for them to be so.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Awesome novel.  Very well written.  Compelling read that would not let me put it down.  I love Kate Morton's style and the way she writes.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Interesting and easy read.  Anxious to read Mom's books now. There are always two sides to the stories.  Can't believe anyone ca turn out normal in that sort of world.  Crazy life!
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I love this film. That about sums it up. I loved this film so much, growing up, that I watched it almost every day. As an adult it is still one of my favorites. This film is very heartwarming and also has some great lessons to learn.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I choose this rating because this is a great book<br />I recommend this book to people who don't make fun of others like Julian😄😄😊
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I actually bought this to go along with my Biology class because we were watching it in class. I bought it so that I could review, however, I found myself very much enjoying the film so much that I actually stopped reviewing and just watched. I learned quite a bit from this film. The visuals are stunning and the narration is very interesting.
B001F4UHFI|1.0|Playback stopped and never did continue,total waste of time. Would like my money back other wise will not use this again.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong while I wait for my Words with Friends partners to send me their moves.  It is similar to the game I have on my computer.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|In this age of media and entertainment portraying violence, nudity and graphic sex with a poor plot, it is refreshing to find a series such as this. Community, family and respect is a novelty story line. I look forward to each episode.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This item fits my mountain buggy stroller perfectly.  It is sturdy enough that my drinks don't spill but soft enough to fit lots of stuff.  With 3 young, active kids that's a must!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|App does what it says. easy to use<br />Samsung p6800<br />If you watch some low quality mp3 of audio from YouTube videos then this is the app for you
B00B23O96A|4.0|I love Eric Clapton and this is something different from him. No complaints, and I would buy it again. Guess change takes time.
B0014U4X3U|5.0|Timeless virtues and values.  I have read them over and over during the past 50 plus years and enjoy them each time I read them.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Good movie, especially if you're a fan of retro gaming.  Funny game cameos.  Story is fairly standard though. Good voice acting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and challenging!  A great way to pass the time while waiting for my daughter after school....thank you vary much!
B000SGSU58|5.0|Michael Connelly never disappoints. I absolutely love his books. Harry Bosch is a great character and I always feel like I am right there in the story. Great book with suspense and a major twist in the end. I hope the series goes on forever!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|FAVORITE APP....USE DAILY. IS SUCH A BLESSING TO HAVE THIS FOR KIDS AND MYSELF TO READ DAILY. ANY TRANSLATION YOU USE.
B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather is slow to load sometimes, but overall very good.  I love that you can see weather for so many locations.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Did not find any redeeming qualities in this book, even when making allowances for the difference in country's culture. By the end I was still waiting for it to wind up with some interest.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent book.  Very compelling, with lots of twists and turns in the plot.<br />Read it in a few days.  Definately recommend it.
B0071WQ7WU|1.0|When I first heard Bully (the stupidest song written in the last 10 years not written by Taylor Swift), I prayed that it was not a representation of the whole album. Alas, it didn't get much better. This waste of plastic is a sad document of what happens when a great band tries to grab more commercial acceptance. The first three Shinedown albums are excellent, musically and lyrically. Hopefully a return to form lies in the not-too-distant future, or this band has had it! Please come back Shinedown!
B007IK44CK|3.0|Solid MI tech, only gripe was that not all of the cast members were of the calibre deserving of the franchise.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton continues to entertain your heart.  Season three is full of unexpected happenings.  Recommend viewing Season One and Two prior to Season three.  Excellant series!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|OMG! just bought this CD and it is AWESOME!<br />Yes awesome the lead singer's voice just mesmerized me. The actual band, talent, perfect CD. Love it good job FUN!
B003O86FMW|5.0|great story, fabulous writing, could not put this book down,  want the next book as soon as possible!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was great and a real page turner. All I can say is read it for yourself you will not regret it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved this series from season 1-3 this last series was wonderful.  I can't wait till October for season 4.
0345803485|2.0|I think the book is way too graphic and just goes on and on and on about the same things.  I've had this since Christmas and still have not finished it because I've been so turned off by its contents.  It highlights one of the main characters as a very weak woman who caves in to a rich man.  At times it is so graphic and disturbing that it makes me sick to my stomach.  I definitely will not be buying the follow-up books.  If I do finally complete reading the book, it will be only to see if the female character finally stands up for herself and stop caving in to the male character.  The female character goes beyond what she feels is right and honorable.  No book needs to be this graphic, especially over and over and over . . . . . .
B000RK3JOC|5.0|Bought this for my roommate, and she really appreciated it. Right as described, and great condition, so thanks a bunch.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. I highly recomend it. I literally could not put it down.
B0063IH60K|1.0|On the Craig tablet, it was very hard to play this game. It was very slow and hard to quit a game.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Probably my most favorite version of this movie so far, the actors were normal everyday people, not screen heart throbs.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love, love, love Facebook. It is not only a way of staying connected to friends and family. I also love the games that I play on Facebook. It is also a great way to network.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Am a Jane Austen fan as are millions, and love to watch any and all movie versions of her stories.
B00947N6UG|5.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It had a great plot and was a big hit with my family as well. everyone should get a copy for themselves!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Who does not like Pride and Prejudice, I don't know how many versions I have seen, even more than one black and white ones. I have the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle version too, hard to say which one I prefer.
B008B9JTLI|4.0|I like this movie, it`s one you won`t mind to much too watch 2 or 5 times. worth the every penny.
0800141660|5.0|One of my most favorite versions of this movie, have watched it frequently.Am a big fan of Kate Winslet she is from my hometown and my sister knows her parents.
0783110871|4.0|it`s a good movie, you won`t mind watching this over and over, if you like flightplan, red eye, snakes on a plane, executive decision, you will enjoy this one.
B00BUVDE3I|2.0|I reviewed several different versions and selected this one because it has the standard line numbers - important if you're in a group discussion. The navagation features and page layout are just fine when I open this on my laptop using the Kindle Reader program. But, when I transfer the book to my Kindle, the navagation freezes and the fonts go heywire.  I tried removing and reloading the book several times but the results were always the same.  I finally purchased the Latus ePublishing edition without line numbers. that product does load and function properly on my Kindle.
B00846REIS|3.0|Not as good as 50 shades! And hard to read directly after 50. I kept getting the characters confused in my mind. So I would
B005HSL626|1.0|Its actually sort of fun but then it keeps crashing on my kindle. After it closes, I try and reopen it. It takes me back to the last screen then closes again. Can't even get back in.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm totally addicted to this series, a must watch!  With all the junk on t.v. today this show is done in excellent taste and has a terrific story line.
B0006J28MI|3.0|I just wanted this for my collection and because a friend had a part and I like Mcaulay's earlier pictures as a young lad
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|It's difficult to do a movie about an actual person many people have seen, especially one who was imitated during his lifetime. Hopkins and Mirren are of course excellent. It's nice to see actors of this age and quality /not/ have to resort to playing the curmudgeonous grandparent to some sixteen-year-old lead.<br />We enjoyed this movie a lot.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|A disappointment after reading the hyped reviews.  Good narrative, nice plot twists.  But too much neurotic introspection, not enough action. --JkM
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Glad Rodriguez is finally getting the $$ for his albums!<br />So glad I found him! Love his music!<br />The documentary DVD about his life and career - &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; -is a MUST WATCH!!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Altho I find these movies somewhat out there, I still take the time to watch.  Afterall, it's entertainment, and James Bond does entertain.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Glad Rodriguez is finally getting the $$ for his albums!<br />So glad I found him! Love his music!<br />The documentary DVD about his life and career - &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; -is a MUST WATCH!!
B003HARV4S|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  I find it was done quite nicely.  I like the going back in time to another era as well.
030758836X|1.0|I haven't written a review in a while, and I think other reviewers have said almost everything I could say about \\"Gone Girl\\", but the truth is that I do have something to say. This book, to me, represents everything that is wrong with the publishing industry today. High hype for what is a truly awful book, zillions in marketing spent to promote this garbage, and a book that simply does not deserve anything but a slush pile in some assistant editor's office. I hated the characters (especially Amy- I wanted to slap her), hated the ridiculous plot (think the shopping mall scene), hated EVERYTHING about this book. I just self-published my first book after a year of trying to land an agent, and much of the self-published work I read is just as good or better than the highly-financed, connection-ridden drivel like \\"Gone Girl\\". Oh, and in case you haven't heard- the ending is really, really, terribly bad.
6305428387|5.0|Another fun movie with John Candy.  I can watch this movie definitely more often than others.  He always keeps me laughing.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a beautifully written narrative about the ordinary and unspeakable facets of life. It covers a lifetime, rich with parallels for anyone.
B000092T6M|5.0|I loved this movie since it came out in '91.  Watched it every Sunday growing up.  No, it's not historically accurate but who cares.  I consider it a fairy tale to begin with.  This was a must have for me and I bought it when it came out.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Don't really need my feedback here. This book has been read by many people who have all enjoyed it. Hard to put down
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Lures you in using the veil of mathematics & science but soon enough reveals itself as nothing more than pretentious writing & movie making.  I have little patience for any movie with religious undertones and 'Pi' is no exception.  Half-way in, I could already sense the propaganda for Judaism.  This movie is steeped in mysticism; the writers, producers, director even the actors should be ashamed of themselves for using π - a respected scientific concept - to legitimise their nonsensical dogma.
B007REV4YI|5.0|What can I say, this is an awesome movie for action goers.  One of the best, most action packed Bonds I've seen.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Makes me want to start the next one right away.  Earlier bad reviews did not hold me back from reading and I am glad I did not listen.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has not read any Holmes stories.  It is a great introduction to his thought processes and Doyle's style of writing.  This definitely prepares you for the Hound of the Baskerville.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was a really good movie. Characters with real life flaws trying to work it out. Some succeed, some do not.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|whether you want to look at the allegory or just the beautiful cinematography in this movie, i really enjoyed it. adult concept even though i 5 year old grandson liked alot of the animals he didnt really understand all of it
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Great movie!!!  The kids just got into Harry Potter and they are enjoying it!  They will continue to follow the stories.
B003D0E3FM|2.0|The background noises are very distracting from the dialogue.  It was better when I was a kid.  Even our son thought the sounds were annoying.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I don't always learn my history from movies, but this one was really good. It made me look further into the incidents to find out how historically accurate it was and from what I could find, it seemed pretty close!
B0058O84G0|5.0|First book of the trilogy.  Terrific story - well written - great characters - well researched.  A Most enjoyable read.
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|The acting was  really great, but I got very bored with the story line long before the movie was over.
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|the story continues to be okay - but the general impression is that it was churned out.  there is too much padding.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like how simple it is to add a city and keep an eye on the weather for that city.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|This is a book well worth reading.  It flows well and is most enjoyable and well researched.  Really great story.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the best app for passing time,it has very great graphics and is SO addicting!Hey,you guys REALLY need to try this app.IT IS SO AWESOME!I loved the app,SO YOU SHOULD TO!!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was my kind of book to read. Couldn't put it down, when I finished I read it again, that never happens with me and books! I immediately bought walking disaster and loved that too!
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I use this app as a video monitor in my nursery. I use a foscam FI8910W. This app, paired with that camera gives me the ability to hear sounds coming from the nursery and allows me to talk through the camera as well. The app also has the ability to snap a picture through your ip camera, with is fun.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|i have been told this was a great movie. thanks to prime i got to see it free. thanks again amazon prime.
B008Y73940|4.0|Great twists and turns, on the edge of your seat courtroom drama. Matthew McConaughey is terrific in this film! Spellbinding cast!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Not disappointed at all. Wanted to read it before seeing the movie. Took awhile to get into the book but once the adventure started it was excellent. The ending gets you thinking though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What a great read!<br />Couldn't put them down, had to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many books on Near Death experiences and this is by far the best. Especially because it is written by a physician. Disspells the science vs religion in my book. Fascinating read.
1442337966|5.0|If you are feeling less than yourself and want to change your life, then listen to this CD and feel your power within.
B00BYKIKJS|1.0|When I first heard about this film, I was told it was a romantic comedy where two people who are a little different find love.  You know, that sounds lovely.  However, this film is really a false portrayal of hope.  It perpetuates the ill-conceived notion that people with mental illnesses will be cured simply by getting exercise and being happy.  The \\"comedy\\" in this film is a highly dysfunctional family unraveling. Watching people with serious mental affliction go through agonizing difficulties? It isn't funny.  Everyone who says this movie is uplifting and wonderful has clearly never been in a dangerous situation with a person suffering from mental illness.  Anyone who has been around people who suffer will find this film exceedingly triggering.  It is insulting that it keeps the misconception that turning a frown upside-down will cure depression.  It is ludicrous that the message spread here is that finding love will cure your broken psyche.  it is infuriating that all of the characters get down on the main character for his mental illness, while never openly acknowledging that the father is also suffering from rather pronounced mental issues himself.<br /><br />As for the acting, there are some truly brilliant portrayals of people suffering through mental illness and broken families.  This doesn't change the fact that screaming in a diner is nowhere near as Oscar-worthy as portraying the progression of a series of strokes.  Other films and performances went unrecognized because people jumped on the \\"mind over matter and we'll all be okay!\\" bandwagon.  This film portrays a false hope, which might lead some people with mental affliction to believe that they, too will be cured if they go for a jog and get sexy with a neighbor.  While it is certainly possible for people suffering from mental illness to find love and be in a long-term loving relationship, those relationships do not cure the mental illness.  This film pokes fun at mental illness and unstable family situations while simultaneously sending the message that illness magically disappears if you learn to be happy.  This is insulting, and everyone who thinks this film is the best thing since toast and tea should really read some books about the reality of mental illnesses and stop buying into the mass delusion that people simply choose to have mental affliction.tuations while simultaneously sending the message that illness magically disappears if you learn to be happy.

074356619X|5.0|I first purchased this CD years ago and some how misplaced it.  I almost went crazy when I could not longer find it.  Then I calmed down and went to amazon and there it was.  I recommend listening to this CD it will change your life no matter what situation you are facing.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|It Does what it says it will do. Best pro of this type.It functions very well for me. It also worked well with my ipad.

B0095ZMMCK|3.0|A predictable but somewhat pleasant book by Clancy would be a reasonable rating for Threat Vector.  Worth a trip to the library.
B0043J08C4|5.0|Even though many might consider this installment at the same level as the first two it does come pretty close.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|This is a great movie I love it and so does my two year old who repeats everything from it as well as that is her imaginary friends name
0142405809|3.0|Like the story but it needed a bit more zip or pizzaz I think. Was a fun read but didn't seem to hold my grandbabies interest.
B007R21JJK|5.0|If your looking for a great overclocking MoBo for a good price then this is it. I've overclocked my 3570k to an amazing 4.8Ghz with this motherboard and could have gone higher if not for the heat. My computer stays completely stable with this motherboard.<br /><br />I also like this board because it has 6 usb 3.0 ports on the panel. It also has 2 sataIII ports and 4 sataII ports. It also has an mSATA slot.<br /><br />This board is also SLI/Crossfire ready. And I've used this with two 660Ti's in SLI. And it worked great, no problems at all<br /><br />So if you want a great overclocking board with a plethora of USB and SATA connections, along with SLI/Crossfire capability, then this is a great choice. There's no downfalls to this motherboard that I can see.
1476733953|5.0|I was reading on my lunch break, going to bed early (to read), and otherwise structuring my life around finishing this story.  After some pretty heavy political philosophy, I was looking a nice light sci-fi read, and I got more than I bargained for.  The mystery, characters, and world created by Howey were utterly believable and wonderfully detailed, and the structure of the plot kept bringing to mind complementary comparisons to Asimov's Foundation Trilogy.  Can't wait to read the rest - prequels, sequels... I need to pace myself, if only to make sure I don't lose touch with my real life up here on the surface.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|*Kindle formatting is great, one of the best I've read on my Kindle*<br /><br />Wool is an interesting piece of sci-fi and well worth a person's time if they are predisposed to dystopian works. Where I would place this is somewhere in the middle of the pack of science fiction that is out there, but certainly higher when compared to the scarcity of good sci-fi that has been released recently. Howry's writing ability is quite good it only drags a little bit here and there when a character takes a long trip via mental exposition.<br /><br />*****Spoilers Below*****<br /><br />Where I had problems with the plot generally had to do with character motivations that didn't seem particularly realistic. One of the primary ones had to do with the silo cleanings and the explanation for why they always happened, even when the people were cued into the machinations of the Silo's IT. Which makes the ending even more problematic, without giving too much away we as readers are required to take a leap of faith that the motivations of the current sheriff make sense given the political dynamics of the silo. Not to mention that I felt sentencing his former boss to death on top of everything else that has happened, seemed to come out of left field.<br />Even given that - why would he then have a problem with Juliette making changes to how the silo operates (given that she has been elected mayor) when he has already thrown out the rule book by allowing Juliette back into the silo? (And why would Bernard fail to do the cleaning if he truly believes in the 'Code' for running the silo?)<br />Perhaps if Sheriff Billingsly had been a main character these issues wouldn't seem so glaring, but given that we don't know more, it comes across as little more than a way to tie things up at the end of the story.<br /><br />Anyway I don't want people to feel my nit-picking means I didn't like or wouldn't recommend the novel, I actually think it is a fun read and if it's in your regular reading wheel-house, by all means click the buy button.
B000TGJ7ZY|2.0|If you`re looking for Dracula meets an X- rated Beauty and the Beast then this is your kind of movie! I was doing a school final on the novel vs the movie, so I thought what`s better to watch Bram Stoker`s Dracula. This was a bad choice. The movie seems to be making fun of the classical novel, not complimenting it.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Seemed like i was watching Lincoln. Very true to what did happen based upon the books we were taught from.
B007EECSFA|4.0|My book club LOVED the book.  I will say the following:<br /><br />1.  I did not guess the ending. This is rare for me.<br />2.  I thought that the book was a little long, a lot of what was said could have been done with fewer words.  I guess that is the business person in me.<br /><br />Over all I thought it was a good book, worth reading.  I did make several guesses about what was going to happen which were correct, but the ending threw me off.  Congratulations to Kate.  That usually doesn't happen!
1451627289|5.0|A truly engaging novel showing great imagination. King makes his character endearing. This is a departure from his scary books and I like it. This has more personality and depth and I believe would appeal to a much wider audience than most of his work. I loved the book and did not want it to end!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|amazing, saw it twice in theatres and had to have it the day it came out!!  So glad I preordered--got the price guaranteed and it arrived the day BEFORE it was released!
B000AP04MO|5.0|Bought this to share with friends; Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney are fabulous. Good depiction of a marriage (and how a couple deals with the inevitable &#34;bumps along the road&#34;).  Scenes from Europe are great.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the series.  Didn't start watching till January 2013.  Caught up on first seasons before the new season started in January 2013....  Can't wait till it starts over again.<br /><br />When I have nothing else to do, I watch old episodes just for fun.
1451695195|5.0|When a Neurosurgeon has an &#34;N.D.E.&#34; (Near Death Experience), this certainly should even give agnositcs &#34;pause.&#34;  Good book; easy read; well done; very credible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm so happy that people were able to come up with subway surfers I don't no what I would do without it:)hope you enjoy the app as much as I do!:)
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really enjoyed most of this book.  However, the ending was so unbelievable and the characters' actions so improbable that I almost regret having invested my time in reading it to begin with.
0634022296|4.0|This book has the chords directly above the words, making it pretty easy to play many Beatles songs. It also has chord diagrams for any unusual chords or chords you don't know. There are no riffs though and for some bizarre reason the book is in haphazard alphabetical order. For instance Golden Slumbers falls between Dig It and Do You Want To Know a Secret. Other than that the book is very good.
B00BTGDNGC|5.0|Awesome vinyl. Sounds great and love jamming to some vintage Iron Maiden. Quality sound. Vinyl looks in perfect condition along with sleeve.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I love this movie.  Uplifting,funny,touching, thought provoking, great actors and the music is awesome. I have recommended it all my friends.
0201485672|5.0|A good book.<br /><br />But don't read it continuously. Instead you should practice right after reading a pattern/tip, or even before it.<br /><br />For example, readers of the first chapter: \\"Refactoring, the first example\\" should type/copy the (bad) code about the 3 classes Customer, Rental, Movie, and try to improve it using their current knowledge before reading the book.<br /><br />Only after you have tried your best should you read the ideas of the authors again. You may agree or disagree with it, but you would definitely gain more insight into refactoring than just reading the book.<br /><br />So open the book, read, close the book, think, practice your own way, open the book again, compare, close the book, ... You would become another programmer.<br /><br />\\"One needs 10,000 hours of refactoring to be a programming expert\\" as people put it :).
1401937268|4.0|I like these cards because they are a more uplifting rendition of some of the original tarot cards.  The pictures are gorgeous and lift your thoughts.  I use these cards on a daily basis and like the spreads I get with them.  They are helpful but if you are not used to working with the tarot cards be sure to read the booklet that comes with the cards.  I didn't feel an instant connection with these cards but I liked them so I make sure that I spend some time each day going through them and getting used to them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|As always, Flynn does a spectacular job of creating characters in Gone Girl. The tale is dark and twisted, which is perfectly acceptable in my reading world. However, I was let down by the lack of moral fiber in the collective whole of this character set. One strong, endearing character who was not a self-centered, corrupt jerk, helps me be okay with waking up in the morning. This one left me wanting Flynn to dig a little deeper and give me something beyond the shocking.  I'll give her another shot, but another one like this and I'll stop reading.
0307913147|5.0|Ready Player One By Ernest Cline<br /><br />5 Stars<br /><br />Virtual reality in the year 2044 is the setting for this quirky, nerdy book. Wade Watts is our main player who is deep into the virtual reality world of the Oasis. Things have progressed far in our world, it's a grim, dirty, and depressing place to be. Not so when you're plugged into the Oasis. You can pretty much live your whole life there if you choose and most do, going to work, school and trolling for love all from the comfort of their homes. Or un-comfort of their homes which is why they are all there in the first place.<br /><br />The creator of the Oasis James Halliday has hidden an easter egg within it. He set up an elaborate contest that was to go on after his death that would result in the ultimate prize worth killing for. Wade is one of the Gunters, (computer geeks) who devotes most all of his time in the hunt for, all the while watching out for the baddies that are the Sixers. Wade finds out a lot along the way about himself, his friends, and how he lives his life. One thing though is that James Halliday loved pop culture from the 80's, gotta love this man. This is one wild adventure, the ultimate quest, much like being given the golden ticket to enter the chocolate factory. Don't worry there's a reference to that in there as well.<br /><br />What a wonderful book! It really had a lot within it. It was a trip down memory lane for me and I'm sure for anyone that grew up during the 80's, or remembers them. I did not think that I would like this book initially since I really was not much of a gamer growing up. I did play a lot of Atari 400, Missile Command, etc. Not to mention the 400 had a \\"keyboard\\" and I spent a LOT of time banging out the typing mantra across a blue screen. Oh, those were the days. Regardless of what I thought there was not a reference that I didn't recognize and there are lots of them. I didn't need to be a computer gamer geek to get this at all. I laughed so much at the 80's song and catch phrases that the narrator on the audio played out.<br /><br />This book also had a serious side at least to me. It's a look at where we came from in our tech savvy world and how we got where we are today. There are pros and cons to everything. It's a look at what the future might hold and how disconnected we all could be. It is very very possible. I did not game when I was younger, however I did play many many many hours of a popular MMORPG called Starwars Galaxies Online, and I will tell you it can consume you. I did not sleep or eat for periods of time. It was a virtual world where I was dealing with real people that you can develop very real relationships with, some that I still have. It has a cost though. Now I do not play, there just isn't time. Facebook can be just as dangerous with it's little games or any other social media.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this to almost anyone. It is just an utter delight and you won't be disappointed.
B0040LLLMQ|5.0|Just introduced my son to 'Lost' but hadn't had the copy of Season Six. It was wonderful to re-live the story and to watch him become a complete & utter &#34;Lostie&#34; and to submerge himself into the story lines. Owning Season Six (& all previous seasons) will ensure many viewings and even more discussions on the brilliant writing and commitment to the characters that the actors portrayed.
B000GG4ZTU|4.0|Metal Machine Music is not your typical Lou Reed, if there is such a thing. But nothing like \\"Waiting on the Man\\" or \\"Candy Says\\" HERE!  This \\"Stereo\\" recording has completely different sounds buzzing and droning independently and simultaneously from each (stereo) speaker. When you hear this reprocessed as 5.1 (or 7.1), you will be bombarded by a Lost Wonder of recording. This Hum comes from 1975, and prominently displayed on the album (or Mlps) jacket is a representation of the \\"phenylethylamine\\" ring,<br />(not drawn quite right), but Metal Machine Music was all about an era of SPEED.  Fast Elevator Music from Hell! Brought to you by the brilliance and audacity of Lou Reed.  This is the \\"missing link\\" in your Lou Reed collection, and represents the avant garde as much today as when it was released. I bought the Japanese Mlps CD release because of the quality of the packaging and sound, (and so the sealed PROMO 2LP vinyl Set copy from RCA in my collection could remain sealed).  It is like opening Pandora's Box of Sound, and like so many unusual selections, not for everyone.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was hoping for more from this book. I thought he would finally conclude the story of some of my favorite characters. But the story just kept going on and on with them never getting to where they were going.
0736092269|5.0|Everything about the order was great, got my book fast. The book is very detail and helps when you are working out. So I enjoy this book more than any other that had to do with this subject, plus it had stretchs in this book as well.
1476733953|5.0|Few can tell a story as well as Mr. Howey - he is truly an artist.  With relatable characters and beautifully detailed descriptions this a series I will read again I loved it so much.  I recommended it to every avid reader I know and they have all thanked me for it.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|My grandson really liked this.  He played it for hours when he would come over on weekends.  He is the only one who uses my Kindle right now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|flipping awewome.at first I said it was ok.now I play it all the time like in the car or at a store when I'm bored
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I does what it says it does.  I needed something to help keep my Kindle clean.  I got this and it works.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|It's not as much fun as the last three. It's a perfect introduction to the series. Still a good story and the effects are great. I'm sure the next two will be more suspenseful and action packed.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I thought it connected two powerful characters in a great story but not quite finished yet so hopefully will not disappoint
B000UFAURI|5.0|I am a big fan so understand that it would be difficult for them to put out something I wouldn't give at least 3 stars to.  This is a great album...so 5!
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|It's almost like we get to share Darlene's personal worship. She has surrounded herself with some great musicians and this live album is almost flawless!<br /><br />Favorite: Victor's Crown!!! (for now...)
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Dave has made his mark and now he is enjoying it!  No one hit wonders here!  Solid album.  Great to just play in the background all day.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I am too intimidated to write a review about this album because I am truly biased when it comes to JM. I absolutely loved this album and it's a must-have for any John Mayer fan.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Didn't know what all the fuss was about but now I'm hooked. Can't wait to finish watching all the seasons!
B0014VPFTA|5.0|Continuum is John Mayer's finest work to date. It embodies his mature writing with his guitar playing prowess. Most definitely one of the best rock/blues albums ever made.
0307341577|4.0|Gillian Flynn again takes us through the up and down of figuring out who done it! So many surprises and twist and turns, great read!
B00005OAIE|4.0|Prepare yourself for a ride with cool riffs and smooth lyrics. This is the stepping stone for John's much more mature work, However you will be amazed by his song writing and guitar playing abilities from the get-go. A must have!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I thought about giving it four stars because of the ads, but that is what makes it free, and they only pop up at the beginning and you can skip them immediately. I like the different card backs (more kitties, please) and several different deals. Wish it would rank scores, though. I play it a lot, I really like it.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|It was a lot of things that were seen before.  Rerun.  wasn't what I expected.  could havee been better yes!
B008602KQI|4.0|Reminded me about the manga/movie Battle Royale. I definitely enjoyed the idea and how they executed it. I highly recommend this one.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|At first I thought the musicality of Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman were a little lacking but in perspective they sang true...and as you would expect older men who have had rough lives to sound. The story of redemptive love resonates to a place we can all appreciate. How sad to live such a legalistic life, yet even today, there are those who are unbending in their view of right and wrong and when their misguided belief system fails they just don't know what to do with their lives. We saw that in Chavert and in all the young men who could have saved themselves from an eventual massacre except for \\"pride and honor.\\" What price do we pay to be \\"right\\" instead of honorable?  The forgiveness of the priest to Valjean which literally changed his life, Valjean's willingness to get involved changed Cossette's life and Marius' life, and even Chavert's.  I found the story of Chavert to be most interesting. You have to really listen to his words to learn he was born in prison and rose up from the gutter, too. And his whole life was about rules and regulations. The law, above all else, was his god. He reminded me of the Pharisees in dealing with Jesus: Legalism rises above the intent. There is only black and white and no room for forgiveness, ever. Valjean discovered, first hand. what redemptive love is and he played it forward over and over. But it was so fitting that Chavert's demise was in secret so Valjean never did learn he was truly a free man.  I love this story on so many levels that now I'm going to read the book. I also enjoy the cd. It helps to understand the words better. I had seen the play twice on stage but only through the closeness of the characters in the movie did I finally understand the story.  Words can't describe how Anne Hathaway's magnificent performance was so deserving of the awards she received. Hugh Jackman was truly amazing in my book as he aged and turned from a hardened pathetic common thief to a man of respect and wealth with a heart of gold. Oneof my favorite actoresses, Amanda Seifred, has a gorgeous clear voice and was a perfect Cosette.  I know people who don't like musicals and especially musicals where there is no talking. I found that, like listening to Shakespeare, if you let yourself get lost in the story and it's well done, you forget about accents and poetry and even talk-singing and just get swept up in the moment. I'm glad I own it to watch again and again.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie was very funny. I found myself cringing while watching various scenes. I wouldn't recommend it. However do as you please, but here's my I told you so.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|We've seen the play, have dvd's of the Anniversary Performances, and saw it at the cinema at Christmas, our daughter has read the book.  Needless to say, it's a favorite of ours so we had to have the dvd of the movie as well.  Fantastic movie, great cast.  We couldn't be more pleased.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another exciting and entertaining read by Mr. Flynn.  While we are sure Mitch will win in the end, the reader is still held in suspense as to how it will happen.  Just wish we had a Mitch Rapp in DC today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game also for preteens to play.  They absolutely love it and want to play it all the time.<br />I would definitely recommend this game to others.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Whats` not to like. Clapton is at his best putting his twist to some great classics. I can never get enough of this man. I have never heard someone who can play so many different styles of music and they all sound great. Everyone should enjoy this performer while he is still with us!!!!!!!!!!
B00BKBCF38|4.0|how divisive the opinions are on this band.  It really seems to come across as a love them/hate them relationship with the listening public.<br /><br />I am completely on board with these guys.  They have found that sweet spot between theatrical \\"campy-ness\\" and musical credibility.  These guys take me back to a time when all of my favorite bands were singing about Satan... As far as I am concerned, these guys do Mercyful Fate better than Mercyful Fate ever did...  and trust me.. I like Mercyful Fate.  While the comparisons to MF are unavoidable, simply writing them off as a mere MF clone is really not fair.  Ghost's sound is far more complex and melodic than anything MF every did.  The tasteful keyboards reference everything from Deep Purple to 60s psychedelia and certainly add a dose of Monster Mash-like creepiness.<br /><br />I thought this album showed real growth from the debut and really stands on it own.  The production is better, but it is certainly not over done.  It definitely sounds \\"bigger\\" than the debut.  They traded in a bit of the heaviness for a little more prog and pop.  The use of a background choir on a couple of the songs shows a more bombastic side of the band, while adding an \\"epic\\" ambiance. Once thing remains constant... the frequent references to Satan and/or Lucifer.<br /><br />I make no apologies for liking these guys.. haha
6304498969|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable DVD I have. I wish the picture quality was better but the sound is great! The song selection is outstanding!

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have been Playing This game. it is My Favorite App. I Like the Great White Shark But it is Hard To get . This is a great game and fun to play.
B003R0MF5I|3.0|I--like many women worldwide--fell hopelessly in love with Zachary Levi as Chuck in the first three seasons of this show.  The plotlines, the chemistry between Chuck and Sarah (or Lou...or Hannah...or Jill...), how he managed to get out of scrapes...bringing Morgan into the fold in Season 3, all of it.  Had me hook, line, and intersect.<br /><br />Then Season 4.<br /><br />Ohhh, Season 4.  Why must you betray me?<br /><br />I don't know if a writer left the staff, or if they just decided now that Chuck and Sarah are an item that the plots didn't matter as much, or got to a point where they were secure enough in their fan base to start messing with it, but honestly, this season feels overly formulaic and jump-the-shark every episode.  I just finished Disc 3 of this season and honestly...I'm not sure if I want to finish watching the rest of the season, or Season 5 for that matter.<br /><br />Some people love the Timothy Dalton/Linda Hamilton additions to the cast.  I personally think the season suffers from it.  The Ring and Fulcrum made everything seem actually menacing and dangerous, where as Volkoff just seems campy and silly.  Linda Hamilton is nowhere near as compelling as Orion was.<br /><br />I think Sarah's character is getting pretty diluted at this point as well.<br /><br />Essentially, IMHO, this season is to the Chuck franchise what Pirates of the Caribbean 2/3/4 were to the first movie.  If I keep watching at this point, it'll be because I'm invested enough in the characters to want to see what happens to them...not because the story is compelling.  That makes me sad.<br /><br />On the grainy video:  It just looks to me like they changed filming style this season.  I think that's a stylistic camera choice, not the DVD quality.  I have the other seasons on DVD (not BluRay) as well and they do look different.

B008XBASVY|5.0|I first decided to read this book because of all of the great reviews it gained. Also the fact that Chris Colfer is an amazing Actor, writer, singer, etc.. Anyways, Carson's journey and life values in the book are great. The characters and plot were brilliantly invented. Try and read this book, you won't regret it!
B005PK1G76|4.0|I got this for my BJ city micro. It's easy to Velcro on, but the nature if the stroller handle bar doesn't allow for it to sit completely flat. So beware when putting in beverages that it does tilt a little.  Overall I like it.

B000FA675C|5.0|Exellent book, as are all of Dan Brown's books.  Once you start reading, it is hard to put down.  The book is equally as good as the movie.  In some of the events that take place, the book gives a better and more detailed explanation.  Would definitely recommend reading it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have heard about this book for years and never got around to it.  I am kicking myself, this book was fantastic, can't wait to read more.
B0084670FU|3.0|I found this movie to be slow getting to the point.  Very heavy subject matter.  It was interesting though.  I would recommend.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Great international movie. The actors did an amazing job of portraying Italian culture and struggles during the Holocaust. Such a great plot, you almost forget the movie is in Italian because the portrayal speaks a universal language.

B00BAVCD8A|3.0|I must say this album was a let down in the sense the new fall out boy just doesn't sound as good as their past records. I'd expected more out of this record than they delivered to their fans this time around.
B007PM218K|5.0|I had never seen this film before. WOW what a story! Henry Fonda is perfectly cast. The picture quality and sound has brought this classic back to as good as new. Just tremendous!
B000AARKOO|5.0|Great movie! My son's and I really enjoyed it :) I received it on time and in great condition. Very pleased with my purchase
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Liza Minnnelli's finest hour! A masterpiece from the hand of Bob Fosse. This film changed the shape of musicals. The musical numbers are supberb and finally in widescreen. Picture quality still a bit grainy but that's how I remember it way back in 1973 when I saw it at the Mayfair in Sydney, on Castlereagh Street. A breathtaking film on every level!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting that I can't stop please make a Hawai'i version<br />It would make it awesome like wear Hawaii beach cloths. Hang loose
B00866JLEG|5.0|Initially saw this in the movie theaters, after seeing the trailer for it... figured it had an interesting plot and premise to it. If you have seen previous Nicholas Sparks movies ... this is another one you would want to see.
B009R659L8|5.0|I loved the book, as I have every other book I have read written by Mary Higgins Clark. The stories are always suspenseful , and the characters believable. I know this book just came out, but I am already looking forward to her next book!
B00005JKES|5.0|I had to buy the pilot  on VHS (!) in order to relive this great show, which I was obsessed with while in grad school.<br />Otherwise, this is a fun though sometimes heartbreaking romp with just seven episodes making the first season.  It all revolves around the murder of a teenage girl in a town in Washington state, with an FBI agent, the local sheriffs,and the many citizens with problems and secrets of their own getting involved in various ways.<br /><br />Kyle MacLachlan is the standout as Agent Cooper, but the rest of the cast members are no slouches either.
B009AJDDQU|2.0|best thing was the set design, the story was weak and the charactures were pretty terrible.<br />This movie should have been called &#34;Hipsters In Space&#34;.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Both of my daughters, 3 and 5 enjoy this movie - in particular the music!  They love the characters and the story.  My husband and I love to watch it too.  We sing along with the girls and like the characters.  This movie captures the spirit of New Orleans.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|If the batman really wanted to desgise his voice don't you think he should be talking with an indian accent or something that really throws people off?
B003EI2EH2|4.0|Good book didnt read all of it picked at the chapters that I was most interested in.  Like I said good book
044024630X|4.0|This is the second Jack Reacher book I've read and I enjoyed it better than the first (\\"Killing Floor\\").  The story was tight, the dialogue well done and witty, and the characters were nicely fleshed out.<br /><br />\\"The Affair\\" is about a murder that's occurred outside a high security army base in rural Mississippi.  An MP is sent to the base to investigate in case the culprit is a solider, but Jack Reacher, an MP himself, is sent to oversee the police investigation as well (since the murder didn't actually occur on base).  Little does he know that the local sheriff was a former Marine MP, so she recognizes what she's dealing with in Reacher.  This is a well-written who-done-it that keeps you guessing until the end.<br /><br />My only real complaint was the violence Reacher commits during the investigation.  He took steps that seemed unnecessary and others seemed ok with it.  This didn't seem plausible, but I think the story was good enough to allow me to give Child a pass on this.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use Evernote every day and don't know how I'd get along without it. But I do have serious concerns about privacy after reading things about permissions and what it can do with our data.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Hey, I didn't expect to like this book.  Zombies after all.  It was written seriously about a horror movie subject.  It was an interesting read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Was desperate to see the latest season of Downton Abbey. Was glad to find it on amazon instant video. I have a Prime membership and found lots of other goodies as well.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|I know it is an old series, however, the production values are poor. It makes it a chore to watch.  The acting is corny.
B0098460O4|1.0|I was looking forward to witnessing the beginning/ birth of the new great tenor (Jonathan). Simon was right DUMP CHARLOTTE, her pop voice is weak and needs a few years to mature. I would like to speak to the third grader that arranged, and produced the terrible backup orchestra , and chorus. They were silent when Charlotte was featured and smothered Jonathan with the most overbearing chorus, and poorly arranged symphony orchestral production I have listened. It poor quality actually hurt my ears.<br />Please Jonathan make a single album produced by a non pop professional, you'll be legendary.If you want to do some pop with Charlotte, go for it, but add a few more duets like Streisand , or more mature trained voices.<br />Jonathan has to be the next great tenor, Simon if you have his contract, be smart. I know you like dog acts, but you could make music history with JONATHAN
B00003CX8N|5.0|I love the dialogue written for these characters!  Such a sweet story with wonderful actors!  I've read the book and watch the movie from time to time when I feel like a smile!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|You really need to play this one. If you are into hidden object games this is pretty challenging. Pretty good storyline as well
B000IYU9IG|5.0|As a literature major... I have to admit this rewrite of Taming of the Shrew... is my all time favorite Wayne film.  He is, of course, one of my favorite actors for several reasons.  But this film really puts a new perspective on Shakespeare and comedy.  I have had three copies of the DVD, but so far, all have been poorly mastered.  A wonderful blend of Shakespeare and western motif.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I watched a special on how they did the actual singing, it wasn't lip-synced and it showed. The emotions and watching it a second time, I even started to like Russell Crowes performance.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Wish I had this when I was on my last vacation trip. Would have helped with traveling boredom. Just love it. Would definitely recommend it. The price is right!!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is a great video presentation of my favorite movie of 2012!<br />You should not be disappointed - even if you don't have a 3-D TV!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Shipped fast and love the series! Even though I did not like the ending!  What's up with those British. Still loved it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the intrigue, the speed with which the novel moved along and the way each character told his or her story.
1439170916|5.0|The book is a masterpiece of medical reporting and history by an obvious expert in the field .<br />It should be recommended o every person studying or working in the life sciences field to grasp dedication, interest, work ethic, empathy, and unselfish effort toward goal attainment.
0345803493|5.0|I really enjoed this trilogy. It was an easy read and the author kept me interested. Great escape from real life!
0316228532|3.0|OK, but the verve and intensity of her Harry Potter books exposes her interest in diversity but lack of conviction.<br />Hope she tries again and is more finely tuned to what she does best.
0783240236|5.0|The book is always better than the film.  I really enjoyed reading this story as I had only seen the movie.  It was just as scary! Truly enjoyed it
0307960471|4.0|Another fine example of gritty writing of the wavering nature of human frailties.<br />Looking forward to more in the future.
0345803507|5.0|Fun to read!  Nice little book of fantasies. Kept me engaged.  Read it in two days! I totally recommend it!
B00BF11STU|3.0|Difficult to see footage of the raid, lack of context of who is who (and more) leaves me wondering 'what is going on?!'
B000JBWWRY|5.0|The birthday gift for our grandson arrived just in time and was a great hit.  He and his little brother watched it until bedtime and were begging for more at 6:00 the next morning!  Thank you so much.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|For insight into what a seriously or chronically ill person feels, thinks and needs read this book.  If nothing else, it can serve as a guide for things to say to a friend or relatively faced with cancer or some such disease.  At times it is heartbreaking, at times inspiring.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this series!  Margolies is at her best here. The relationships with the other characters see always interesting. If you loved her in ER you will definitely like this show.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The authenticity was marvelous. The acting was superb. Daniel Day-Lewis deserved his Oscar. He makes you forget he is an actor and becomes , a very human, Lincoln. You feel as if you were there in that time and place. I will watch it again and will make a gift of it to my grandson who is a really big of Lincoln's.
B008M721MS|2.0|It was great talking to family and friends... but I had problem and it does not work now.... which annoys me because I cannot talk to friends/family
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|New Age retro hillbilly bluegrass country folk rock music at its very best.  This is a wonderful CD but don't play it around the kids.  Some of the language is not suitable.
0061692042|4.0|But unfortunately that only refers to the first half, which had me in thrall.  But the second half was much less believeable or compelling.
B008J34466|5.0|Every song Pink touches on this CD is great!  The sound quality is perfect and the mix is just magical!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozer is one of those games that grabs your attention and then you can't stop playing. It's easy to play and is suitable for any age. When coins run out you get another one about every 30 seconds, which is a bit frustrating, but you can buy more. When you leave the game for any length of time, particularly overnight, your coin tally has replenished and off you go.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|storyline was weak, movie could have been shorter, there were some funny moments....I fell asleep before the end woke up during the credits....
B005DJGMQE|5.0|Until I saw this movie my knowledge the arrests, trial and executions were non existent. Although the facts are well known to everybody (except me) I was rooting for Mary Surratt to be set free and so I watched to the bitter end and marveled at the injustice that occurred.<br /><br />All actors were believable, and the movie was well paced and gripping to the end.
B000FA675C|5.0|The  author keeps you engrossed in the story.  You have to remind yourself that this is fiction.  Dan Brown is an excellent author.
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|This movie is 'Sinister' to the point of being downright disturbing.  Its hard to put a 'like it' star on this simply because although its a well made movie it has scenes which can make a person feel ill at ease.  I would not like to spoil this show for you with more details but suffice it to say that it can be a bit over the top with the murder scenes.  It is not a movie I would enjoy seeing again and I bought the dvd and am  not really feeling comfortable about giving it away to anyone ( I might toss it out). It gives me the creeps just thinking about it.
B002WN35DC|5.0|Buena historia, la le&iacute; con mi sobrina, nos gusto mucho, es recomendable para todas las personas, tiene buenos mensajes para la vida, lo mas importante que encontr&eacute; es que uno tiene que tratar de no dejar ese ni&ntilde;o interno que todos tenemos y que dejamos sin querer poco a poco cuando crecemos.
B00BU2SIW4|5.0|I will proudly admit, that after their last few releases, all of which I loved, I was eagerly anticipating the release of Delta Machine! I can honestly say I was blown away! Their sound has never been fuller and more creative. D Mode has channeled all the past and expanded upon it! They are by no means trying to re-live the past, only that, like U2, you will always know, almost instantly, that you are listening to Depeche Mode! That being said, Delta Machine rivals anything they have ever done, and that to me is AMAZING!!! Perhaps if you are a bandwagoner &#34;Personal Jesus, Policy of Truth&#34; Fan, you might not enjoy the expansion of their sound. For those of you who are true Depeche Mode fans, I am quite certain you will hear, and greatly enjoy the musical genius that is Delta Machine!!! PS get the deluxe version. Well worth it!
0470913029|4.0|I have been curious about Paleo for a while because a few of  my friends are into it, so I decided to try it myself.  This book really explains the whole concept and also contains recipes.  I found it informative and interesting.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|I've always wanted to get some Jesse Cook music after hearing<br />several of his songs on Smooth Jazz radio stations.  He's good!
B004CURZFC|5.0|My whole family loves this movie from the oldest to the youngest. Great values. Great message. Great movie. I highly recommend this movie for anyone.
0385535147|3.0|I judge Grisham's books by what I consider to be the Grisham gold standard: A Time to Kill. He took his time - two years - writing his first book [although no one paid attention to it until he struck gold with The Firm] and it resulted in a great story, well developed characters and beautifully written.  The Racketeer falls way short of that standard.  It is yet another of Grisham's subsequent efforts that appears to have been rushed in its preparation resulting in a weak story line, characters lacking any real development [other than Bannister]and written without any significant artistry.  In addition it's also yet another of his too short, too much white-space efforts.  When Grishman is at his best, his books shine.  When he's being lazy, one doesn't get one's money worth.  Grisham is a millionaire many, many times over.  He should get back to his Time to Kill basics, take some pride in his work once again and do us all proud in the process.  It's about quality, John, not quantity.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|As a huge Downton Abbey fan, I find it very surprising that these two shows came from the same book. I'm really looking forward to getting further in the series, after which, I plan to read the book that inspired these shows.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Seems that stories are so formulaic that you kind of know the entire plot from just the premise. There were 2 nice twists, one being the archetypal spaghetti cowboy showing up and another being the focus on water scarcity, which then went sideways when it was just misuse, not really scarcity.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really like this game. Good graphics, some strategy. Kind of like Bejeweled. I hope they make a sequel to it.
B009H442DG|5.0|This is a great CD.  Love those two singing together.  Would recommend as a great smooth Christmas album. A+A+A+A+  Fantastic.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoy the game but would enjoy more if there weren't so many pop-ups, after every game.  After you play for awhile it's the same games over and over. Guess you can't complain too much when it's free.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Only a few funny parts.  It was simply watching a dysfunctional family for two hours.  Not all that entertaining.  Not recommended.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This books helps you to relax and worry less. Good reading. I recommend this book if your going through changes.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a well written book.  It was nuanced and authentic in it's characterization of the legal system.  The family dynamics turned this book upside down and inside out.  I couldn't wait to pick it up and keep reading.  The characters were interesting, and deep and the multigenerational issues kept resurfacing and kept the present alive in it's complexity.  I would recommend this book highly.
145470246X|4.0|After seeing Ms. Lippert's work online and in beading magazines, I was delighted to have a collection of her patterns. These patterns are challenging. Having said that, her instructions are clear and the photographs are beautiful.<br />American readers should be advised that many of these patterns call for 8-or10mm chatons [mini rivolis] which are difficult to find, even in specialty bead shops.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|time waster but a clean fun app. i just didn't  like that you have to buy with real money certain aspects to continue. It would. be nice. if we could &quot;barter&quot; with the friends we have added but overall a clean fun game.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Just got it today for my daughter. It was more than we thought it was and it is a great item to have for her collection. Came on time, before the date, had music/ songs that weren't on the two cds that they have.Lots of information on all the guys in the band and lots of cool pictures.
B00005N6KG|2.0|Pros:<br /><br />-cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- cord is short and annoying and likely won't last long<br />- these actually go over your head like ear muffs and the slightest bit of moisture (bound to happen outside in south texas) makes them slip out of your ear<br />- constantly require re-adjustment which distracts from your work out (in my case running)<br />- by the end of my workout they are typically around my neck because I've become frustrated<br />- I use these with a &#34;beat audio&#34; phone and ALL bass tones are distorted and I can hear a lot of background hissing.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Look somewhere else if you want something good and cheap to work out with these may be a good backup if you're in a pinch and that's about it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great for learning to honor and recognize the needs of others in relationships. Great for couples, but also other types of relationships as well.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|I've been an off and on fan of Tolkien for 40 years, but rereading The Lord of the  Rings in recent years, I was even more pleased with the movies, where Peter Jackson took a somewhat wordy tome and streamlined, condensed, and actually improved the narrative.<br />I was really wanting to like The Hobbit movie, but I hardly recognized the book in it. Yes, the story line is the same, but there are the introduction of new subplots, episodes that were done so much more charmingly in the book, and an essentially pompous, unlikable Bilbo Baggins (he was pompous but sweet in the book). For my taste, there is way too much mindless spectacle and action, and too little of the book's humor that endowed the dwarfs and hobbit with charm.<br />A bloated effort, and I don't know if I will bother to watch the sequels.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Arrived on the day it was released.<br />Love every song, all the sense on it make sound on the third, fourth listen, believe me!<br />The booklet is awesome, I like how the band members can make fun of themselves sometimes...
B004GHNIRK|4.0|So glad to get this book. I had to read it in college many years ago and loved reading it again. The story is wonderful. Very emotional read but that makes it fun.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Being a diehard LOTR fan, I dragged my kids to the midnight initial screening of The Hobbit at IMAX 3d.  I loved it, and, knowing the story in detail, feel that the screen version was true to the book, while enhancing with some totally consistent backstory.  Extremely well done.  I feel that if you know and love the Hobbit, you will love this film.  If you don't know the Hobbit, you should have different expectations, it's still a great film.  DVD is true to movie, we have watched it countless times already.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|With a romance inspired storyline. Rutgers Hauer, Michelle Pfeifer and Matthew Broderick all fit their roles well and it's enjoyable even 20+ years after it was made. Don't expect Oscar award winning performances though...just an enjoyable action/romance tale.
B0093X805W|5.0|Loved this book as a kid, now reading it with my child.  It's still fabulous!  Great characters, plot, writing.  Such a masterpiece.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|The story line very well scripted. The actors are doing a superb and convincing job playing their parts. I reccomend to all.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I really enjoy this game but when the level fails and you want to start a new game it won't. You have to tap multiple times and sometimes it still won't reset. I usually have to close out reopen and then it'll respond. I hope this gets fixed.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|My hats off to all of the script writers and directors. The acting is super and the little surprises good. Everyone I know that has watched the show loves it. A must see for all adults.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is one of the better shows on tv right now and has been for the last couple years if you haven't seen it you should definently check it out it will be worth it
B00B2166BS|5.0|I prefer this to micro-USB. It's easier to connect, and it disconnects easily in the event of a mishap, not risking damage to your micro-USB port.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I pre-ordered this video and was so thrilled that it came on the day of release as promised.  I can't say enough about the video and was glad to be able to watch it on the day it was released.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I know so many people that watch this show and has always said &#34;you have to watch it&#34; but I hate coming into a series like this when I have not seen it from the start not knowing how it started who is who.  I have recently purchased Amazon Prime and have been watching from the very beginning and I am so hooked.  I even got my husband hooked now we watch a few episodes almost every night and we are almost done with Season 1.  If you have not seen SOA watch it you will be hooked from the fist episode.  5 stars +.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|This is by far the worst out of all the Paranormal Activity movies. I'm glad I didn't waste my money at the theater when it came out and I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on Amazon. Some of the scariest parts of the movie aren't even caused by the ghost or the \\"evil\\" people in the movie. The one and only time it made me jump was because of a loud noise they added to a scene featuring no paranormal activity. In a word, terrible.
B005IQZB14|5.0|It's amazing to me how certain things come into our lives when we most need them. Most often I'm blindsided by them, knowing I need something but having no idea what exactly it is that I need. Amazing, too, how often its a book that is that piece my heart and head are searching for. That is Wild for me right now. At this moment, reading what Cheryl did, who she became through her journey, it's what I'm looking for. Maybe it's what we all look for at different points in our lives.<br />Wild is touching and honest, personal and real. It's one of those books that you can't help but read fast because you want to be there for what's happening next and yet you want to read it slowly so it won't end.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Graphically amazing... Good acting, simple but impressive story. I don't know if I would watch it again, but it's definately worth watching once.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This movie is awesome! It came on time and was in great packaging! I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|This movie is great. Hope the new one is great to. I love amazons there the best. All the movies have been of the highest quality.
B00B2166BS|5.0|pogo cable charges the Nexes 10 fast just as described, it works great and is nice because we use this tablet a lot
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|I like it, but the problem is they're trying cram 6 different stories into less than an hour episode. I think the episodes should be 2 hours.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|I enjoyed this book.There was mystery till the end as to the outcome. The twist and turns keep my interest till the end.I would read more books from this author. It was obviously written to be a series of books.
B000I9U75G|5.0|I know the critics didn't like this movie but, I loved it and have watched it many times.  One of the coolest Looking Godzillas I have ever seen on the screen.  I actually think the original with Raymond Burr was cheesier but, it was made many yrs ago!  If you like this genre, I think you will like this movie!
0307990850|5.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher books and this one was as great as all the others. Love that man.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|one of the best animated films I've seen in awhile!  The old west theme with bugs, and reptiles in the desert is priceless!  A good guys, bad guys story that you can't help but love.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|it's okay, a detailed list of specs were what I was looking for, I think if it was included in the next edition, it would be a great help.
B008H08XW2|5.0|Once again the songs are superbly written as well as the music and voice are perfect for the songs. Love it!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Compared to the original Temple Run, it definitely goes above the quality of the first. It has its quirks and what not, but definitely, give it a try.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett wove an interesting and informative tale of the historical events leading up to WWI as well as the Russian Revolution.  His characters are believable make the historical events come alive.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|coolest builder ever and extremlybaddicting I love it....Burt it stopped loading and I cant play any more<br />I hope they fix it for kindle fire users
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It was excellent. Kept you in suspense all the way thru the book. Sorry the author is no longer with us. So enjoyed his writting. Loved all 3 books.
0811875555|5.0|I love it, it's totally perfect, great quality of the book and the packaging. Everything is fine with my order.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are enjoying this series and look forward to watching the next episode! We highly recommend this series to anyone who likes family interaction.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Missed seeing this in theater but glad ordered it.  Looking forward to parts 2 & 3. Great addition to ToTR
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is a great book but there is a couple deaths. 10 & 11 Years and older. But great job Lois Lowry.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|The quality of the blu-ray is excellent! Crisp and clear. Soundtrack sounds phenomenal. This is my favorite more of all time!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Less about the plane crash as about addiction and the addicts who fight it. very insightful and deep, more than expected in a very good way.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Really good movie. Blu-ray quality is the way to go for this flick. Buy it and get your popcorn ready!
0691152640|4.0|Using a seemingly endless barrage of data, graphs, and tables, and drawing from exhaustive time series covering many centuries, the authors convey devastatingly that financial crises (viz. sovereign and domestic defaults, banking crises, currency crashes) have occurred innumerable times and will continue to appear. Written in 2009, it predicted painfully correctly the European sovereign-debt crisis. The explanation is made with clarity. The root cause is inordinate financial liberalization compounded by the &#34;this-time-is-different&#34; syndrome; the consequence - subsequent reduced growth, increased unemployment - dire.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play solitaire, it's one of those games that helps you pass the time.It makes you try and out guess the dealier to stack the cards and win the game. This is one of the best old school games.
B0099116AY|3.0|Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones): inattentive,insensitive husband<br />Kay (Meryl Streep): unhappy wife in need of attention and affection<br /><br />I felt for Kay often. And Arnold? He was so complex, which made him the most interesting character. Did this man realize he was taking his wife for granted? I don't think he did. I wanted to know his backstory to find out why he had such a problem with showing affection.<br /><br />Marriage: It's not how many years that matters, but the relationship. Arnold kept saying he and Kay were married for thirty-one years as if that meant something when it was obvious their marriage was in trouble. The focus was mainly on their sex issues, but they had other issues. I found it interesting how their position on the marriage counselor's couch each time they went told a lot about the progress they were making resolving their problems.<br /><br />So basically, Hope Springs is a well-acted dramatic film about a married couple needing help with their sex life. There were parts I wasn't comfortable with,but, all in all, it was okay. It gives unhappy married couples quite a few things to think about.<br /><br />Favorite Lines:<br />Kay - \\"I want a real marriage again.\\"<br />Arnold - \\"Four-thousand dollars. That coulda been a new roof.\\"
B007N85POS|5.0|When my wife is not work she plays ABR HD. She say's it entertains her when she has nothing else to do, and the birds are a riot.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|The movie is amazing, everybody knows that.<br /><br />It comes with DIVX copy, a DVD copy and a blu-ray disc.<br /><br />The box has a 3D effect, very nice for fans.
B004CURZFC|5.0|My 7 year old loves this movie! Might be a little dark for little ones, but a good movie for kids and adults.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Really liked this movie.  Denzel was great in the part.  I would have given it 5 stars but I wouldn't say the movie was excellent, but certainly good enough that I would watch it a 2nd time and not be bored.
