B0009PAVI2|5.0|This was exactly as advertised and works great for my filters. It arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.
B002JH3TW8|3.0|I purchased this adapter in order to connect my external iSight camera (FireWire 400) to my new MacBook Pro (only has FireWire 800). I bought it so that I could use my external iSight camera when my computer was \\"docked\\" and using an external monitor/keyboard and the built-in iSight was not accessible (because the laptop lid is closed). When I plugged it in my iSight was recognized, and I could get audio from it, but not video. Only a black screen where there should be video.    So, I'm not sure why this is, but it seems to be a limitation of the adapter. I have since read on some Mac forums about similar issues with cheap FireWire adapter cables.
B003UYV08E|1.0|I have sent several e-mails to the seller to let them know that I have not received this item.  I have yet to hear back from them so I will be stopping payment on my credit card.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was selected by a book club I belong to.  It is well-written and an extremely interesting premise.  It is so much fun to stumble onto a book where you find yourself wanting to read for hours at a time yet knowing if you do, you will be finished all to soon.  I highly recommend this to readers of \\"literature\\".
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Wow, are you telling me that I can pay $9.99 for a cable that Best Buy wanted me to spend $60 on!?  I got the cables and they worked GREAT, right out of the box!  No loss of data throughput at all and full TV and audio resolutions.  And the hassle free packaging is a total winner.  I didn't have to risk life and limb by cutting through that horrible bubble packaging that the big box stores have.  This item is a WINNER!
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I had watched this program on a PBS program and loved it.  Had to get the DVD for my mother for Christmas, she also loved  it. Very uplifting and awesome.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|For anyone who has to take an elevator at home or at work, you can't tell me that you've never thought about what it would be like to be stuck in an elevator.  I have and it's something that's always on my mind everytime I step into one.  Chances are, most people have been stuck at least once.  It's scary even though you logically know that you're going to get out.  I won't quite compare an elevator ride to flying or taking the subway but it is a form of transportation and you have little control until the big box that encapsulates you decides to open and releases you.  Luckily, 99.9% of the time it does.       Basically, we have a skyscraper office building and three men and two women \\"randomly\\" board the ill fated elevator. On the 30th floor or so they realize they are stuck as the elevator jolts and ceases to move.  Immediately building security that monitors the elevators is aware that they have a stuck elevator and puts a man on the job of getting them unstuck.  What should be an easy procedure becomes challange after challange as attempts to rescue them are thrwarted by seemingly normal mishaps.    A big problem is that building security can see them and speak to them but the trapped passengers cannot be heard.  A detective who is a couple months sober happens to be in the vicinity, investigating a suicide jumper from the skyscraper building where the stuck elevator is.  The detective is brought into the building because as the lights flicker on and off, one of the five is dead so the other four quickly become suspicious of each other.  There was very little character development but that's okay. The storyline that the devil is supposed to be in the elevator and could be any one of them is almost incidental; for me it was all about being in a trapped elevator with no apparent way out. This movie was strangely satisfying and I enjoyed it but when I go back to work tomorrow, I'll take the stairs.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Going into this I thought for sure I'd skip over the Indian segment and maybe even skip some of the other \\"boring\\" parts.  Was I ever wrong!  I could not stop watching any of this.  I didn't even skip the end credits!  So many highlights I don't know where to begin but starting with appearances of the ex-Beatles, Ringo was just plain awesome and Paul is Paul and I mean that in a good way.  Billy Preston rocks the house.  Dhani is the spitting image of his father.  There is nothing maudlin about this and the Monty Python sketch seals that deal.  George wrote so much great music and there's just so much respect shown to him from everyone involved.  Too much to mention.  I just pre-ordered the Blu-ray and can't wait to get it.
0765350386|4.0|I'll do this in bullet format:    -Interesting magic system.  -typical slave revolt theme, but done very well.  -decent if shallow characters ( more depth in later books ).    All in all a worthy read!
B002ZG999U|5.0|And it's not even my birthday! I mean, damn, what a cool, cool, supercool movie to drop out of the sky, man! You know you're having the time of your life when something has gotten you to jump, shout, laugh, salivate, and cheer your ass off like an out-of-control little boy again. It left me throwing fists and feet in the air and giving high fives to my brothers who also had a hell of a time with it. Watch it alone, watch it with your buddies, and, if a chick is into this sort of thing, you can enjoy it just as much with her, if not more (they're great that way).       One of my brothers had already seen it before and gave me the perfect idea of what to expect. I usually don't watch trailers, because it seems all they do is spoil the fun and build up too much expectation or misconceptions, so I didn't see any for this one. But all my brother did was tell me to remember what it was like when we were kids, playing with those fighter figures that had nothing to do with each other, like Rambo, Commando, He-Man, etc. He said, \\"Remember when we thought how cool it would be if we had these legends all in one movie? Well, now we do.\\" But like I said, it was just to prepare me. I personally believe the movie still stands on its own without its big stars. They just gave it an extra blast.       I could easily call this the ultimate guys' night movie, but let's face it, not all guys were created equal in terms of appreciating the fine manly things in life. So here's how I would recommend it. If it's pure, testosterone-pumped action you really want, then you'd better freakin' mean it. The first few minutes of the movie should be more than enough an adrenaline shot for you to decide. It's a killer opening, so if doesn't get you all pumped up and ready to explode with the joy of watching these guys kick maximum ass, get the hell out of there. It's definitely not for you.     Of course, that's not to say it isn't for those who appreciate art and depth. I mean, hey, I love Kubrick,I love Tarantino, but I also love shallow, old-school action like what we got out of the Rambo movies. And I think it's funny when someone says, \\"this is not a thinking man's movie\\", as if not being able to enjoy something simple-minded - even if it's this mindblowingly cool - is a trait to be proud of. Your loss, Einstein. The Expendables is so much damn fun that, if you're into its type, you'll gladly tell art or whatever killjoy trying to get in your way to kiss your action-loving ass.     I bought this directly without thinking twice, and have grown addicted to it. I swear, I think it's gonna put me in the hospital from watching it too many times. Here's to a sequel!
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Thought the story got bogged down to much in each individual life and did not show as much about the war we were fighting.  Still a good show for the most part.
B003HTPHTK|4.0|[[ASIN:B001675YQ6 Love and Other Disasters]] starts off slow and takes about three-quarters of an hour (out of 1.5 hours total) to really develop. Some of the earlier scenes are just abysmal. So be patient. Essentially, a desperate single woman tries to set a photographer up with her gay roommate, but the photographer is actually straight. On its face, [[ASIN:B001675YQ6 Love and Other Disasters]] is just like any other typical romantic comedy; you have the helpless protagonist, the \\"white knight\\" suitor, the misunderstanding, and the dramatic reconciliation. However, this movie knowingly toys around with the archetype and pokes fun at cliches in the genre. And it manages to do all of this without losing the rhythm and emotional vibe of an actual romantic comedy. I'd have given the movie a slightly higher ranking if it managed to catch the viewers interest quicker and developing the actual plot more (in retrospect, the actual courtship seems to happen overnight).
B000W9MMPU|2.0|I'm sure the product is fine. It is the HD DVD version which I didn't realize won't run on a 'regular' DVD player. Before you order, verify that you have the right equipment or it won't play.

B002UJIY7A|4.0|It keeps you guessing and then it gives you what you didn't expect. Loved Milla in this film, she was great.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|When I first heard about BATTLE ROYALE, it sounded like a mindless, ultra-violent movie about survival. Having seen it, I can say that, while it deals w/ survival, it's also a social satire / black comedy that uses violence to drive its point home. It reminded me (a bit) of LORD OF THE FLIES, only w/ far more mass murder! Actually, what I liked most were the more touching, emotional moments in between the brutal deaths. The friendships, the doomed, secret crushes, and the sacrifices made for others. Without these parts, BR would have been as stupid as BOOT CAMP! Another thing worth noting is the cast's acting. I never felt like I was watching a bunch of painfully young actors. Very convincing. Another superior offering from Japan...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|One of the best YA fantasies I have read since Harry Potter. I could have easily read it in one day if I had the time. Katniss is a well rounded character with clear motives. I don't quite understand Peeta, but maybe that will come in the next book. The part about Rue was beautifully written. Overall an excellent book worth the price. I will be buying the others.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I'm not gonna  pur any spoilers in here but one thing i'm gonna say. i sure wish i had gone to the hteatres to watch this movie. Very Well done
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Purchasing the majority of my Christmas gifts from Amazon.com led me to a hassle free shopping experience.  This movie is one of my favorites that my children loved when they were younger, so naturally I wanted to purchase it for my grandson.  I ordered it, it was here in a few days, wrapped and under the tree... Love it!
B004498KPU|4.0|The videos are great but the quality is wanting to match the quality that Michael produced. It is great to have so much at an accessible price.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Like many of you who are looking for a Gamecube controller, I was tempted to go with one of the cheaper knockoffs. I do like to get bang for the buck, but after doing some research and reading some reviews, I decided to dish out the 29.99 and bought this from Amazon. I am glad I did. The controller really is high quality. I've held some of the other ones available, and they really feel cheap compared to this one. The buttons are really nice and sturdy, everything about it feels the way a top notch controller should. Now, it isn't wireless, but I actually think that that is a plus. First of all, the wire is VERY long. I never owned an original Gamecube( I got this for the Wii) but I have to assume it is way longer than the original Gamecube controllers. So even though it isn't wireless, you still should be able to play your game from just about anywhere in the room. And of course with a wired controller, you don't have to worry about running out and getting batteries every few days. Even  with rechargeable batteries, constantly recharging them can be a little bit of a hassle.    So to sum it up: If you need a Gamecube controller, get this one. Yeah, initially it will set you back more than one of the others, but I think it is worth it. Cause when you add battery cost and/or charging stations, etc, it will probably save you money. And based on the qualities of each controller, in the long run I'm guessing you will get the most gameplay out of this one, by far. Really a quality controller

B003ZJUIGO|4.0|Here I am, in my first 2011 review.<br /><br />Usually, I don't like compilations. They are, yes a cheap way to make fast bucks. There's no point. However, there are a few compilations that, for some strange reasons, \\"stick\\".<br /><br />\\"DEEPEST PURPLE\\" is one of those. From the amazing and classic cover art to the music inside, it's really a portrait of Deep Purple up to the point of its release. This 30th Anniversary edition includes more songs (including the TOmmy Bolin phase) and \\"Hush\\", the hit before Ian GIllan and Roger Glover entered the band.<br /><br />But the real gem here is the DVD containing Jon Lord comments about each track, plus some videos from the time the song was recorded.<br /><br />A worth compilation.<br /><br />Happy New Year everybody.
B002RBU4GA|5.0|We listened to this novel on a really long drive from Idaho to Colorado.  Whenever we had to stop for gas, we hated to turn off the car since we'd have to stop listening to the story! The book is narrated by a dog named Enzo and is told through his eyes, and his owner is a race car driver.  We are lab lovers so we were immediately drawn into this point of view, and learned a lot about race car driving throughout the story.  There is a tremendous unjustice in the story which could have been resolved easily had the eye witness had speech and hands, but the dog remains (like the reader/observer) powerless to right the wrong which occurs.  In the end, things turn out well, and the unexpected twist where fiction kicks into the \\"happy endings\\" mode will delight all dog lovers.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I was blown away by how the image looked and how it sounded.  There's not only a lot of detail in the image, but Fox kept the grain structure of the film - no scrubbing it clean like other movies (or worse, adding back in fake grain afterwards).  It still looks like film, but without any instability issues.  There is nothing to distract you from the story and from just singing along!  If you have an HDTV set, but are only able to watch the DVD, you should try to upgrade to Blu-ray since this is what HD was meant to show!
B00192IV9U|5.0|I received last days the album and I'm simply LOVE it.<br />It's smth each Michael Jackson fan has to have into his collection.<br /><br />There are so many wonderful songs that I'm glad we have been able to hear.<br />And I do hope more, there would be done videos, so that the promotion of the album on the TV channels to be as Michael deserves.<br /><br />I love: Hollywood tonight, Another day, Hold my hand (hope to see its video asap on tvs), Much too soon, Breaking News ...<br /><br />All songs are simply wonderful, as all songs of Michael. I wish he was here to enjoy it as much as we do!
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Inspired by the notorious 1971 London robbery, \\"The Bank Job\\" (2008) adds a political Pandora's Box to the traditional heist genre. The results are enormously entertaining, with solid performances from Jason Statham, Saffron Burrows and David Suchet (as the \\"Porn King of Soho\\"). Director Roger Donaldson contributes some of his most assured work - an ideal blend of seediness and intrigue. No \\"Rififi,\\" but well worth seeing.
B004498KPU|5.0|I received last days the Vision boxed set and I'm really pleased of it.<br />It's smth each Michael Jackson fan has to have into his collection.<br /><br />Maybe there are videos already seen, but it's a good idea to have them all in an wonderful collection as Vision is.
0312370849|5.0|Such an amazing story.  I was pulled in immediately and couldn't put it down till I knew what happened.  Without this book, I may never have known what happened in France on that horrible day.  Never forget.
1400079144|3.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed this story right up until the end ~ the story line, the surprises were truly creative and did surprise me but COME ON !  with all those twists and plots THAT's how you end the book.....   I was sorely disappointed
B001PPLIEG|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE!  I bought this, per the request, of my 18 year old son.  He had already seen it, but loved it so much that he wanted to own it!
0143038583|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Most of the other reviews seem to hit the fine details. I thought I kept on top of what was going on in the food industry, but I was missing so much until reading this book. It was very enlightening and interesting to read. I liked it so much that I gave away my original copy and bought another one.
B0016PM722|5.0|My son loves these lightsabers so much I bought him a second one so we can battle. Out of all the things he owns these are his favorite!
B003MC5N28|4.0|A marvelous dystopian future, with most of the \\"sci-fi\\" stuff hidden behind the scenes.  The writing is wonderful, and the protagonist someone we can all identify with.  My only complaint is the somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying ending.  This is a rather famous book, and should probably be in any serious reader's collection.  I recommend for age 12 and up.  Older teens probably won't appreciate it, but once past the \\"I don't read kids books\\" phase it can be read again for more depth and analysis.  For some reason, Giver gets banned a lot, which I can't fathom.  The only thing I can think is an issue; there is one particularly distressing scene.  Parents should probably read this first so that can both decide what age is appropriate for the child to read it and to be prepared to discuss some major issues.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, although I was starting to lose interest in the day to day life in the Room.  Fortunately it was at about that time the story took a dramatic turn and grabbed me again.  Ma somehow miraculously creates a life for herself and her son during years of captivity without completely losing her mind.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|This was a great gift for my husband. He owns all the other seasons and wanted the last season on blue-ray. Came quickly and was a good gift for a Lost lover.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a classic Christmas movie.  We watch it every Christmas, and it remains a favorite among all family members.  It is the best in the National Lampoon's collection.  Highly recommended for the whole family.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a great series. My husband and I loved it on PBS but the DVDs have additional footage that help explain some things that were unclear on TV. Can't wait for next season.     Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman were perfectly casted as Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. The chemistry between the two characters was well played and fun. If you like mysteries and shows that make you think, you'll like this series.

A Smart, witty, and well acted horror masterpiece! If you like horror jump right in!
B00402FGE4|3.0|The problem is that the series is character driven and not plot driven. Most of the characters are not like able. I like rush young and Eli. Most of the conversion that character are not interesting. The writers are good make interesting events feel trivial and focus to much on trivial. Like the sub stories which do help the main plot. alot of es also feels like not much is going on.   I think they failed on trying space opera gene. Only few of the episodes have lot of tension and suspense  which make you want to watch more.

B0021L8V0W|4.0|I really liked this film. Angelina Jolie, is the top action star, no doubt! In fact in special features you find out she did most of her own stunts!Salt has a interesting story, i'm sure by now you know the basic story. This blu-ray includes the Theatrical film plus 2 unrated cuts! As with with most newer movies the picture qualty is eye candy and the sound ear candy! This is a blu-ray from sony , the inventor of blu-ray, so no surprise , Sony bd titles have been the last 3 years just great. Salt is edge of your seat entertainment, great cast. I say buy it
B000SMWUPS|5.0|In my opinion, this console is MUCH sturdier than the bob console.  I bought one for each single stroller my family has.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|You can say what you want about Avatar, but no can say anything negitive about what were looking at on screen. I have never seen anything quite like it. Last time i said that was 1977 when i saw Starwars. James Cameron up the anti with Performance Capture by inventing the technology. The story itself wasn't all that bad, so we have dances with wolves, and fern gully, so what!, There noting new under the sun, just a varition on a theme. Besides every film in history is taken from something before it. If you can watch this film,without being so harsh, or from a childs point of view, its a good flick. Now this is the blu-ray of the year, the best looking blu-ray of the year.This edtion gives you 3 versions of the film, plus we get to see how they did everything. Cameron used every gb on this 50gb disc for the movies plus another for special features. This set is worth every penny plus amazons price made it even better.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This film appears as a tribute to the days of the \\"Swashbucklers\\", a time when one could sit, literally fastened to their seats, in the excitement of pure entertainment. No headgame challenges, nothing to  opine about, enough historical fiction to actually reach the level of being thrilling. The lead actor had the charisma of both of the Fairbank's, Errol Flynn and Gregory Peck. It is a pity most of the films of those great actors are no longer available. For those of us who weary of the mind bending,sexually suggestive, violence for violences sake stuff that is foisted as \\"Adventure\\" nowadays, this was a film to which one could  bring ones family. Not an Oscar winner and maybe not even a colossal hit at the boxoffice but an honest to God good movie. I loved it and hope there will be a sequel.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|I got this album because it was recommended on \\"That Metal Show's\\" pick of the week. \\"That Metal Show\\" has made some good suggestions but most of them have tired out after a few listens. This hasn't been so with BCC. In spite of the muddy equalization, I can't stop listening to it. \\"Black Country\\" is a great choice for an opening song and following it with the infectious \\"One Last Soul\\" is also a great strategy. Both songs are great choices to release as singles.     \\"The Great Divide\\" sounds like a cross between Cream and Deep Purple. The guitar solo reminds me of the more blues-based solos of Ritchie Blackmore. In fact, the same could also be said for \\"Down Again\\".    The opening wah pedal work and the main riff of  guitarist Joe Bonamassa in \\"Beggar Man\\" along with the wah solo is very reminiscent of Hendrix. \\"Song of Yesterday\\" has a southern rock flavor to it and builds nicely from its soft opening. I also hear some elements of Led Zeppelin in this tune especially in the solo.     \\"No Time\\" reeks of Texas blues in both the main riff and the solo work. There's a little bit of John Paul Jones in the keyboard break.    In fact, Bonamassa does a great job sounding like other guitarists throughout the whole album. There's nothing wrong with that as far as I'm concerned. If you're going to sound like someone, then sound like someone who's great. I hear in his solo work the influence of the greats- Clapton, Hendrix, and a touch of Page. As a guitarist, I hear a lot of unison bends along with solo pharases that end with a bend that resolves itself with the same pitch as the previous note.  I personally prefer a wilder guitarist such as Steve Vai but I don't think Vai would be a good choice for this band. Bonamassa is a fine guitarist and a good choice for this band since most of the musicians are from the seventies. This is my first exposure to his work. I understand from my research on him that he's mostly a virtuoso blues man who wanted to venture into hard rock. Hehas the right foundation in the blues. If he keeps at it he'll find his own rock voice. Play what you hear in your head instead of how your favorite artist would play it.    I hear a lot of Cream in the arrangement of \\"Medusa\\"  and \\"Too Late for the Sun\\" and the solos remind me of  Clapton during those years. These songs are extended jams that start off quietly, builds, and does the previous two steps again. I find that all of the songs in this album are well crafted and performed well although not in the pocket but there is a place in music for performances that are slightly imprecise. Such an approach renders its own feel.    Glen Hughes' vocals are as soulful as any black R&B singer and it's amazing that after all these years he can still hit the same notes that he was hitting when he sang on Deep Purple's \\"Storm Bringer\\", California Jam\\",  and \\"Burn\\" albums in the mid seventies and that was thirty-five years ago. Very few of the older rockers such as Steven Tyler, Dee Snider, and the late Dio who was able to belt it out just as strong to the day he died have had the same vocal endurance and ability as Glenn Hughes. This can't be said of Robert Plant or Roger Daltry.    My only complaint about this album is the overall sound of it. It sounds a little muffled and seems to lack clarity when it comes out of my surround speaker system but when I play it through a pair of open air earbuds it has some of the highs and definition it's been missing but it could still sound better. I'm not sure if this is due to the recording process, the production, or a lack of funds. I've tried to doctor it a little but I've had no luck. This is the only reason that I gave it four out of five stars. It's still an album that I don't regret owning and can't stop listening to because of the songs themselves.
B0013527I4|5.0|I love The Muppet Show and so does my daughter.  Very satisfied.  And the third season is especially hilarious!
B002RKSZMQ|1.0|After testing this book several times, as well as all other content on my kindle, it is clear that this item is causing my kindle to freeze and eventually restart. Extremely frustrating to say the least. I haven't tried the older edition, but I would recommend staying away from this one(March 17, 2006 edition) like the plague.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|This is my first movie review, so bare with me.<br /><br />As a movie, I can probably say that this was a very 'ok' movie, and is worth probably a good-not-solid 4.<br />But, since this movie seems to primarily be based on Resident Evil 5 the video game, I was only hoping that they would add those nice touches from the game.<br /><br />I watched this on DVD, not in blu-ray, or at the movie theaters, so I didn't witness the 3D like everyone.<br />I also don't have a 3D TV with 3D glasses for the blu-ray either, so that's probably also something that took away from the excitement.<br />When I first rented this (for $1 from the Redbox) I was thinking: Yes! I get to see more of Albert Wesker! Yes! I get to see the Executioner Majini! Yes, Chris Redfield in the movie for the first time! Yes, yes, yes!<br /><br />But while I was watching the movie, and these characters started appearing, I was more saying no, no, no!! I'll explain.<br />They have the characters appearance down to a T, but the actors they got to play them are more-than-off.<br />I have a big problem with the people they cast to play Chris Redfield and Albert Wesker.<br />Since I'm coming specifically from Resident Evil 5 (As I've never played the previous ones and don't really know how Chris or Wesker looked in their thinner days), I'm expecting the actor that plays Chris to be chiseled and probably a little better looking than who they got to play, which is one of the stars from the show Prison Break: Wentworth Miller ([...])<br /><br />Now, I started personally liking him as a PERSON, so I started to overlook that they got him to play the part, but it was still a back-thought saying \\"I'm settling with less by accepting him to play this part!\\" Wentworth is particularly skinny and thin when it comes to this character, even though he has Chris's voice (from Resident Evil 5) down packed, but it also doesn't look right for him to be talking like that. Chris talks a little overly-dramatic, or at least KIND of, and Wentworth did a great job at that, but it didn't look right for him to be talking like that, and also took away from the character and movie.<br /><br />Next, it's Albert Wesker. Again, coming from the game itself I was expecting the Albert Wesker they cast to be older and more mature.<br />Personally, it doesn't look right for Wesker to be 'Young,' seeing him on Resident Evil 4, he actually was alot younger looking than 5, but I started liking his matureness on 5. But the person they have playing this character is: Shawn Roberts ([...]). Honestly, he started looking like a Mr.Smith (from Matrix) more than Wesker. Again, I started liking this actor as a person, therefor tried to overlook the character he was playing; but unlike Chris's actor, I just couldn't. Honestly, he is way too young to play this character, and his face is a little fat and it's just not kosher. Really, this was kind of a big deal breaker for me, seeing as Wesker is one of my favorite characters, yet they ruined him so deeply.<br /><br />As far as everyone else goes, I never played any of the previous Resident Evils before RE4, so I don't know many of the new characters they introduced, like Luther West (Played by Boris Kudjo), if he even IS a character from the video game series.<br />I just knew Claire from her relationship between Chris (sister/brother). But other than that, I guess they have the right casting; I pretty much just look at the new characters they bring from the game, which I think they never execute properly at all, it's always something big off in regards to the actor playing the characters, even though they can't always be the perfect match, they still can find much better people to play these parts.<br /><br />But enough about the characters and actors.<br />The movie itself isn't scary at ALL, much like Resident Evil 5, so they got THAT correct. It's barely even suspenseful.<br />It's actually pretty boring and slow until the Executioner Majini comes in to play, but inmy honest opinion, even that battle was done wrong. Knowing that the Executioner Majini would be in the movie, I was happy to see how well the fight looked against him and the protagonists; but really, for him to be an Executioner the whole battle (if you wanna go as far as to call it \\"a battle\\") surely wasn't executed right at all.<br /><br />I don't know if the infected in this movie are Majini or Zombies or what, but they do resemble Majini's how their mouths open up and the things come out, so I'll just call them as both. I liked the way they introduced the Executioner Majini, it was slightly suspenseful and it was like: uh oh! Here it comes! But when they actually fought it, it was cool and everything, but it just wasn't right. You have this big thing, yet it goes down like any other monster with a carefully aimed shot...They tried to shoot it and show that it 'doesn't go down easy,' even with a bullet-to-tha-brain But even that felt like non-sense after a little while.<br /><br />I know that 'bosses' in movies can't be THAT hard or have THAT long of a battle, as it might make the scene feel repetitive, but to have THAT short of a battle just made it seem like you got ripped off. Again, like I said, this is all because I'm coming from the game itself, to critique these things as just a movie-watcher with no knowledge of the game, then it was just another boss fight done well, I GUESS.<br /><br />But anyways, also, a problem I had with this is the fact that they call it a zombie movie, yet there really aren't that many zombies.<br />It seems like they just show a giant horde of zombies on the other side of the barricades to make it seem like uh oh we have to fight all these zombies! But no, really, they only have 2 if not 3 zombie encounters the whole movie. And really, besides the Executioner Majini, they didn't have any new monsters or anything that would make you say \\"What's THAT?\\"<br /><br />The whole movie is basically filled with talking and walking, and while there might be enough action scenes, they aren't such a big impact that would make me say, this is too much action! Which is a bad thing, because none of the scenes were overwhelming, and in a good action movie, there has to be AT LEAST a FEW overwhelming things, to accompany the boring walking and talking scenes that come after it, but no, it was just 'ok' action.<br /><br />Really, I'm not saying that boring walking and talking is actually boring, because it was actually pretty ok, but still, for it to be so much of this, with less-than-stellar action, it kind of makes the whole movie kind of boring, but still good.<br />Like the title says, this is a review from someone who played the games, and is disappointed with the way they implemented things, and is also disappointed with a few of the actors they cast to play such huge roles of Chris Redifield and Albert Wesker, a few of the main hearts of the series. And if I had to rate this movie specifically in ways of a Game-to-Movie transaction, then I would rate it probably a 2, because of the disappointment.<br /><br />But when it comes to a movie itself, I could probably give it a 4, but you have to understand that this IS a game adaptation, if not directly. But it does come from the video game series, and they should have better thought-out the casting a lot better, and added a little more action AND horror/suspense to it. I loved the first Resident Evil movie, because it was scary in the dank underground subway or wherever, but I hate the fact that people can say \\"Fear in daylight\\" and just expect it to be scary...No, there can't be scary movies or games in the daylight, not unless it's filled with deep suspense as well.<br /><br />It may seem like I'm reviewing a Resident Evil game right now, but I just can't help it because I'm a fan of the game(s) and I just wanted to get into some good Resident Evil action. I was hoping, really hoping, that this movie was bring back the scary-feeling that Resident Evil:Extinction, and to a lesser extent, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, was missing.<br /><br />The game elements they implemented into the movie, honestly took big chunks out of the movie itself, seeing as how much they, to me, failed in all aspects of the new things added into the movie.<br /><br />In the beginning of the movie you might be thinking: what? I hope the whole movie isn't like this. But it changes.<br />So, watching this as just a movie-goer with no experience of the game, it might be really boring.<br />I know that I gave this a 3, and possibly a 4, even though I'm talking rather harshly of the movie, but I guess at most it was a pretty alright movie; but like I said, the characters they inserted into this movie (mostly Chris and Wesker) failed in all aspects of the character, beside Wentworth's spot on voice. They can't put ANYone in a black leather coat, black shades, red eyes, and<br />slicked-back hair and call them WESKER...No...no way.<br /><br />I give this a 3, and it's worth a watch. It may not be worth a buy though, if you're collecting these Resident Evil movies, then the most I would say is that it will just be part of the collection, most likely nothing else. This is the worst of all the other 3 Resident Evil movies for me.

B0047WJ12K|4.0|We watched this movie through Amazon's video on demand.  Our experience was good and we enjoyed the movie, but it would have been even better with the option to turn on closed-captioning or subtitles.  My husband is hard of hearing so we always watch movies with the subtitles or closed-captioning on.  We watched it on a laptop with earbuds, which helped channel the sound a little better, but when a character whispers or there is a lot of action in the background, it can be hard to distinguish what was said. Additionally, if the option of closed-captioning or subtitles is available, it would be nice if that were advertised somewhere.      The movie itself would get 5 stars--fast action, reality-bending, mentally challenging to keep up with, and interesting.

B003AJUHKQ|1.0|I stumbled across this release while looking through some VoD listings.  Why did they have to go and butcher GiTS by adding in CGI? Horrible....Just from watching the preview I just had to shake my head in disgust for what they did.  One star for what they did to it, wanted to leave it unrated but couldn't    Watch the original release skip this one.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I always loved Blade Runner, I never understood why it didn't make it on the box office but I didn't care, I loved it since the first time I saw it, then years passed by and I found out that there were other versions, but mainly the final cut with Ridley Scott vision, so I fell for it again and voila, a masterpiece again. There is nothing wrong with this film, it is fantastic, in every scene, every word, the actors are great and I loved the soundtrack. This collection is my pride and joy, and I can continue to watch this wonderful movie over and over again for years to come and now I have the option to see different endings too. Great job from Amazon in delivering it.

The story begins with Alice's first hints of losing her memory and progresses through her mental decline, outlining her emotions and the reactions of her family and colleagues. This is a great book for people who have a loved one with Alzheimer's because, although it is heartbreaking, it also gives a perspective of how the patient's feelings. This story brought tears to my eyes because Alzheimer's is such a tragic disease, but we must always remember that our loved ones are still in there somewhere, struggling to be heard.
B000001FI7|5.0|If you're thinking of purchasing this Portishead album I'd say that's definitely a good choice. Running through the 30 sec. samples should give you a pretty accurate idea about Dummy. No changes in pace or direction halfway or anywhere. I love it.  Every song surely will be anyone's favorite meaning that the whole album's full of great songs. I can fully recommend this classic triphop album. In time you'll love it more and more.  Have fun with it and be sure you dig up the other Portishead albums too, for they are (I think) even better.

B003Y5H4SO|3.0|In South America there is a myth known as the Devil's Meeting. It suggests that the Devil walks among us always, and that an act of suicide gives him license to come in and play his games. For Old Scratch delights in trapping his victims in confined spaces and there tormenting them, before taking them to Hell. M. Night Shyamalan, whose name is mud, produces this one, doesn't direct it. I don't know if that impacts your decision to see or avoid this film. I saw DEVIL and thought it didn't suck. I give it a marginal thumbs up. But it's no SIXTH SENSE. Sadly, those heady days seem to be firmly in Shyamalan's rear view mirror. I hope he proves me and you wrong somewhere down the line. Anyway, DEVIL opens with a suicide, a jumper off a highrise building. The tone is promisingly ominous.<br /><br />DEVIL is a supernatural locked room conundrum, except that \\"supernatural\\" being the operative word, the murder mystery isn't about to play fair with the audience. Still, when five strangers get trapped in an elevator, it's fun to right away start guessing which one of these poor souls is actually the Devil. Because that's the premise of this horror movie.<br /><br />When the Devil's around, everything goes wrong. To demonstrate this, the superstitious security guard (serving as the story's chorus) tosses up a jelly jam sandwich and it lands jelly down, thus ridiculously proving his point. I guess someone was required to establish the film's mythology. The guard also informs the investigating police detective (Chris Messina), as they view the stuck elevator's security camera, that the Devil is allowing them to see what they're seeing for a reason. For the police detective - coping with his own personal tragedy - the connection is easy enough to figure out.<br /><br />I liked this movie, didn't love it. The premise of people stranded in the elevator with the Devil is really intriguing, and I enjoyed how that was presented, liked how the Devil, identity unknown, sowed his seeds of doubt and mistrust. But I feel that more could've been done with the premise. For one thing, the trapped characters aren't developed enough and so there's no real incentive to care whether they survive or not. Also, whatever claustrophobic feel the elevator scenes produced was undermined by other scenes which featured the characters not stuck in the elevator. LIFEBOAT did the claustrophobic movie best - heck, CUBE is another fine example - and partly because there were no outside influences. The cameras focused solely on the cornered characters. Another good one is the Twilight Zone episode \\"Five Characters in Search of an Exit.\\"<br /><br />The story isn't as suspenseful or creepy or scary as I'd hoped. The violence happens off camera, whenever the elevator lights would go out. When the lights came back on, there lay (or hung) the gristly results. Maybe most damningly, when the Devil finally makes his presence known, it's more disappointing than anything. Not at all frightening. So 3 out of 5 stars for the atmospheric ambiance and the premise and the execution of it, but I crave more than what a defanged horror film has to offer. I won't even go into how the film early on sets up sparks between the detective and that hot girl (I think she was an EMT) only to absentmindedly drop that thread.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus material: 3 Deleted Scenes which respectively introduce the salesman, the old woman, and the mechanic, three of the five elevator passengers (totaling 00:03:58 minutes); \\"The Story\\" - a featurette laying out the movie's premise (00:02:33); \\"The Devil's Meeting\\" - Ysamur Flores, PhD Folklore and Mythology, and the filmmakers offer some musings on the Devil (00:02:28); and M.

0891419063|5.0|As good as it gets. As horrific as it gets. As sad and noble as it gets. A review printed on the cover says that With the Old Breed comes close to being a masterpiece. It IS a masterpiece, though thoroughly lacking any pretense or desire to be \\"a masterpiece.\\" I bought it because I watched what is certainly the best mini-series to ever be shown on television, The Pacific, and this book went far beyond expectations, revealing the mini-series to be more Hollywood-ized than I would have expected. This book simply tells it like it was, and like war still is---insanity, a disease, a blight, a failing, a sick test of what it means to be a man. Through Sledge's eyes and his simple eloquent language we discover that in such a situation as war the test reveals those who win and those who loose to be less than human and more than human at the same time. Many other documents or diaries of war are written by people who simply cannot write, trying desperately to cling to that vision of the soldier as both noble and savage. Or it is written by a \\"writer\\" who is just blowing us with metaphors and flowers. Or it is edited to death. Sledge, because he is simply the soldier, reveals what that sorry vision truly means and entails. It means we loose the best of the best generation to madness and futility. It means we slaughter the innocents and guilty alike, indiscriminately in the fog of battle. And, by inference and recent history, in a country like ours has become over the past 50 years, that we ARE the enemy. We have forgotten the valiant and the lost and have turned into the very sort of enemy we fought in the 2nd World War. This book reveals what we have lost as well as the price it took to save it only temporarily. We are no longer innocent. Dwight Eisenhower was the last great President and his words about the Military Industrial Complex in his farewell speech I watched on TV as a child were not spoken by someone duped into reading the speech without knowing its meaning. His words were a true and accurate warning from the generation who truly sacrificed for good to the generations who are now fighting for greed. Blessings on those men who fought what is so ironically called The Good Fight. But there are no blessings for those who fight for oil companies and international dominance. If you read this book you will see the truth of the irony of war written by someone who was not a writer, but a human being who became more than a writer in the process. Hollywood screwed it up a bit, but also pointed me to this book, which I deeply appreciate. Lecky's book, Helmet for My Pillow, is also an amazing testament and certainly well written, but With the Old Breed avoids the pretense of the \\"writer\\" and is, by that very mechanism, powerful and deeply moving, respectful and intensely human.rds were a true and accurate warning from the generation who truly sacrificed for good to the generations who are now fighting for greed.

0060936223|3.0|Back in the 70s I had friends who went to the San Francisco Art Institute. I used to visit them regularly, and we would cruise The City like the Beats in the 50s looking for art, poetry, and cheap highs. Punk was just coming alive when we discovered Patti Smith, The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, Television, etc. We even started our own punk band.    Smith was my friends' hero.  I liked her but not as much as I liked Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, and some of the other proto-punks. Just Kids reminded me of how exciting that period was for music, art, and poetry, but I think Smith should stick to poetry. Her prose is so flowery and thick with romantic imagery that I longed for a passage from Hemingway, Carver, or even Bukowski. Her poetry, she often reminds the reader, is deeply influenced by the Symbolists, Dadaists and Surrealists. And it's painfully obvious in her prose style, too.    Still, I couldn't put the book down. It was fascinating to learn about how Smith's and Mapplethorpe's relationship and work evolved. And I enjoyed reading about what was happening in New York at the same time my friends and I were in San Francisco. Smith knew just about every important art, music, or literary person during that period. She tells great stories about her first meetings with Sam Shepard, William Burroughs, and a bunch of other famous folk. Definitely worth a read if you're an old punk like me.

0307277453|5.0|Your Inner Fish by Neil Shubin<br />The title is a little off-putting, but the book is excellent. Neil Shubin is a paleontologist, but not one of the kind who puts you to sleep with unpronouncable species names and obscure anatomical parts. Here is an author who writes to the general audience, and is very gifted at doing it. The theme is that all of us living today have a linkage with animals of the past, even into the distant past. Not only can we see our primitive skeleton's origin, but DNA evidence connects us too. Embryology and evolutionary development are rapidly advancing fields which are identifying the very genes which turn off and on to build us from the time your father's sperm fertilized your mother's egg and your life began. We are mammals, but we have had distant ancestors who were tetrapods, before that, amphibians, and before that, lungfish.<br /><br />Shubin reaches back even further in time then that. All life that ever existed has a common ancestry. He shows how numerous contributors of biological science discovered that fact and built on it. Like a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle 90% assembled,the true picture of our origins is becoming clearer and clearer. I think this evolutionary story is one of the greatest adventure stories ever told. Shubin understands the story and clearly presents it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and would buy the next book from this author without a backwards glance.<br />Ralph Hermansen, January 2, 2011
B000LN7HUC|5.0|This is my second purchase, the 1st one I gave away to a teenager scrounging backpacking gear.  I don't backpack anymore but still wanted a back up stove, one I could take in my jeep without worrying about petroleum leaking or pressurized tanks going KABOOM!  This stove is absolutely \\"No Maintenence Required!\\" It can sit for years and still fire up on the first light! Lotz of different alcohol fuels are available if you know what you are looking for. The holder, pans and burner are 1st rate construction and materials. Only drawback is the limited time of burn, around 25 minutes. If you want to simmer cook a pot of beans this could be a drawback. So I bought several burners and now can just keep on cooking. Haven't done beans yet but rice and the coffee pot are a snap! I don't intend to use this just for heating water for freezed dried foods.  Take it from this Former Marine who use to cook with Trioxin on a C-rations \\"hobo stove\\" the Trangia is \\"Ay Numbah Wun!\\"

The 'mind eff' everyone is talking about at the end is... well who cares? You're supposed to feel for the protagionist, but here, I really don't care about him. I got to meet the children briefly and that was really the only payoff in the entire movie... that and Michael Caine.

B000FC12YQ|5.0|This was the first Agatha Christie I read.  I felt as if I had to read at least one of her books since she's known as the Queen of her genre.  And I was blown away.  I quickly read a lot more of her books, but this one is still my favorite.  It was one of the first books I bought in the Kindle format.    It's not a book of action.  In fact, the narrator in many ways is just on the sideline watching Poirot.  He's a doctor in a small town who yearns to be free of it.  Many of the characters have secrets, giving Poirot and the reader a slew of suspects.    It's a book I enjoy rereading every so often.  Even knowing the answer to the mysteries, I find myself enjoying the characters and all their interactions.
B000V86OKG|5.0|What can I say ... Dexter is great. Imagine rooting for a serial killer, albeit a serial killer who kills serial killers. A fantastic blend of humor and drama with old-fashioned cliff hangers that keep you pushing on to the next episode. Warning: it's contagious. It's addictive. A made-for-TV movie series that actually is as good, if not better, than the book. The casting is outstanding and the plot engrossing. More than two \\"thumbs up\\".

B003VANOFY|4.0|The 7.1 surround sound, which needs the included drivers and software, sounds great.  Software can adjust volumes for each of the 7 sattellites, and the woofer.  Software also has a great equalizer, and a voice morphing gimic.  The headset itself charges very quickly through USB, and it lasts a long time: 30 minute charge = 6-8 hours.  It looks very durable and the microphone goes up completely out of your way when not in use.  It has only three configurable buttons and a volume and a mute, which I found was too limited.  Here is the only major issue I have.  It's very top heavy.  Maybe it's because of all that 7.1 surround sound tech in that headset itself.  When laying in bed and getting back up, you have to hold the headset so it doesn't fly off your head because of it's weight.  In summary,  it sound great, but adds the weight.

Now, for Havana Nights, I know the plot isn't very well written and the script has some pretty corny dialogue, but the dancing makes up for it big time. I love the sensual feel of this movie, and it could partly be because I'm Hispanic and LOVE the way Hispanic's dance. Diego and Romola have amazing chemistry, overall, I think that it's a great film that makes you want to dance once you finish watching it.

B0038OY6DW|5.0|The first film in over 20 years to feature Sherlock Holmes in the United States stars Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, Rachel McAdams & Mark Strong. It's very consistent with the stories written by Sir Arthur, incoporating lines from several of them and even a line from \\"Henry V\\" by William Shakespeare (specifically Act III, Scene I). Downey Jr does a very good British accent and his portrayal of Holmes is spot-on, ranking up there with Basil Rathbone (yes, THAT Basil Rathbone) while Law's Dr. Watson differs from Nigel Bruce's endearing (but comically inept) Watson, which is in keeping with the way Sir Arthur wrote Watson. Rachel McAdams was perfect as Irene Adler, the only person to outwit Holmes, and Mark Strong is chilling as Lord Blackwood, the mysterious enemy behind a nefarious plot to destroy the world. Like \\"Young Sherlock Holmes,\\" this film is not based on any particular short story or novel by Sir Arthur, but retains the basic elements of the characters as Sir Arthur wrote them to be. It's an excellent movie. Should have been rated PG instead of PG-13. Action, suspense, mystery and romance abound here. All the while, a familiar adversary lurks in the shadows. Be ready.

B000QUCNOK|5.0|I was mesmerized by this film and recommend it to anyone looking for something different.  The cast is exceptional, the storyline thickens consistently, and imagery is outstanding.  The ending may have placed the movie in the love/hate  dichotomy, but the whole movie is a fantastic journey in itself!  Possibly occult-classic-worthy.

142311339X|4.0|Greek mythology, scary bad guys, and an ominous prophecy. Sound familiar? It should, it's exactly like the Percy Jackson series, but while those books were up and down for me, The Lost Hero is a solid start. There were many things I didn't like about the book, yet I couldn't put it down. First, the good.<br /><br />It's hard to go wrong with a book about Greek mythology, but then again I thought the same about ancient Egypt, yet I strongly disliked The Red Pyramid. In The Lost Hero the Greek mythology is a plus, and what makes the book interesting. Riordan doesn't tell you everything about every mythological being he mentions, which hopefully spurs readers to go look up information. A book that makes you want to learn? Rare, but here it is. Another plus is the story, there is a bit of a mystery as to who the bad guy is in this book and we aren't certain that we can trust all the characters at first. I appreciate that, even if it didn't last. I also have to give a big A+ to the beginning of this book. For once we aren't thrown into the action right away. There is a bit of getting to know the characters and exploring Camp Half-Blood before all of the action and questing begins. Lastly, The Lost Hero is an easy read. There are no overlong sections of inaction and explanation that can sometimes bog down a novel, and I felt that this book was a real page turner.<br /><br />Now, since there are many 5 star reviews out there, if you are interested in what I didn't like about the book here it is. First, the prophecy. This may be a pet peeve of mine, and may not bother everyone, but I think that authors building a story around a prophecy is taking the easy way out. Sure the prophecy will be cryptic and you don't know exactly what each part means until the end, but consider this. Instead of the heroes heading out of camp half blood in a hurry because a prophecy or god tells them they only have a week to do something, lets say they are at camp, news comes in of some unsettling things. For instance, the winds are acting strange, it seems like the gods are following orders from some other being. People are sent to investigate and come across some news that makes the characters need to head to a certain place. That is how a normal story would unfold. This one does not do that. Instead a quest is given, someone in camp tells the heroes exactly where to go, once they get there and overcome an obstacle they are told where to go next. There is no exploring, investigating, or thinking. Just action, travel, action, travel, and I don't like it.<br /><br />Which leads me to my second issue, action. There is too much of it. Maybe children can't focus in a novel if there isn't action on every page. I don't think that is true, see 700 page Harry Potter books. I loved them because it's not quest based, it's character based, and I could read an entire book with the characters just going to school because it's that interesting. That is not the case here, the world and the beings make it interesting, but still, instead of making the characters complete their quest in 3 days why not stretch it out a bit and have the characters actually have to use their brains?<br /><br />Issue number three, the characters and multiple viewpoints. Sometimes an author can weave multiple tales into one seamless story, but it is rare. One of two things happen. One, there are too many characters and you completely lose track of what is going on, or two the story is repetitive and the multiple viewpoints overlap. The Lost Hero falls into the second category. Three heroes are traveling together and we have to see every event from each of their viewpoints. It doesn't add much to the story, and the overlap is a bit irritating at times. The characters themselves are not that deep or multidimensional, but they do have enough distinguishing characteristics be entertaining.<br /><br />My last issue, and it is a minor one, is the language. If we are in Leo's section he will say that girls are hot dude and then in the next sentence use a hefty vocabulary word. The story isn't first person, yet the language used in each section is tailored to the specific character. Take page 66 for example, Leo was like sweet sign me up dude look at those fine looking girls. Then we have gods, which are ancient powerful beings, that seem stupid at times. They don't seem wise at all. Maybe because they change with the times, they are just as intelligent as an average human being, but that just doesn't sit well with me. Everything is very laid back in this book, and it doesn't feel right. It's fun at the expense of seriousness, and a sense of danger. A series about Greek gods and demigods should be epic. I mean there are beings that are threatening to destroy the world, yet the points that stick out to me are an irritating faun, idiotic gods, and childish main characters. Like woah, look at that big metal dragon thingy!<br /><br />Overall, this story has potential. The Lost Hero has the same flaws that I saw in the Percy Jackson series, but it is still entertaining. I wouldn't suggest reading it if you haven't read the Percy Jackson series because this feels more like a continuation than the start of a completely new series. Also, if you liked the Percy Jackson books I don't think that guarantees that you will like this. There are new characters that are completely different from the old characters, and the story has a different feel with the multiple viewpoints. The introduction of the Roman aspects of the gods is an interesting storyline, and I will continue to read this series for awhile. Give it a try if you are on the fence.ntence use a hefty vocabulary word. The story isn't first person, yet the language used in each section is tailored to the specific character.

B000001EYO|3.0|This is my favorite movie so any apsect of it, like the music, will also be applauded by me.<br /><br />I would imagine that when compiling a soundtrack for sale, there are probably legal channels and royalty issues that need to be addressed. If I was CCR, why would I want my music on anything other than my own works? Setting aside that this does not truly refect all the music in the movie, this is what I think.<br /><br />I love this off-beat and totally bizarre soundtrack. The weird stringing of these mostly unrelated songs parallels the mood of the movie and personality of \\"The Dude\\".<br /><br />How can I not start with psychodelic Kenny Rogers? Kenny friggin Rogers singing a scorching version of \\"Just dropped in to see what condition my condition is in\\"! What an awesome song!<br /><br />How about the Gypsy Kings singing a Spanish language version of \\"Hotel California\\"? Magnificent!<br /><br />The Dylan song \\"Man in Me\\" is an uncommon, uplifting song pulled from his catelog.<br /><br />\\"Dead Flowers\\" is a Townes Van Zandt classic.<br /><br />The strength of this cd is not in it's completeness (it's missing of some of the movies' most noted tunes) but rather, similar to some of Quentin Taratino's soundtrackness, the total randomness of the selections.<br /><br />NOTE, you can pick this up for probably $5.00 so it's hard to go wrong with this. If you are a fan of the movie and can have the Kenny Rogers and Gypsy Kings songs, then how can you go wrong?
B002ZG98PA|5.0|TANGLED, the latest animated film by those clever Disney folks, is an updated take on the classic tale of Rapunzel.  I had the pleasure of seeing this over Christmas with four kids - 3 girls and a boy, ages 13, 10, 7, and 5 - as well as my still single bother-in-law.  And, everyone in this very diverse group had a wonderful time.<br /><br />TANGLED follows the storyline of the Rapunzel fairy tale, so I won't retell it here.  However, Disney has added humor, music, and enough surprises to turn TANGLED into an delighful, modern story for the 21st century.  Like Tiana from The Princess and The Frog, Rapunzel is not your typical, faint of heart princess; when an intruder breaches her tower, she handily whacks him with a cast iron skillet and makes him her prisoner.  She boldly goes after her destiny and discovers who she really is.  As much as I like Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora, these new Disney princesses go after what they want, work hard, and, (with help from friends) succeed.  And along the way, they and the \\"prince\\" end up helping each other.  These are the role models I want for my kids!<br /><br />The animation in TANGLED is gorgeous, the music (Alan Menken!!!) is outstanding and catchy, and the voice acting is excellent.  Mandy Moore is on point as the spunky, strong willed Rapunzel, and she sings beautifully as well.  Donna Murphy (as the wicked witch) and Zachary Levi (as the roguish intruder) both turn in fine voice and singing performances as well.  The animal characters, Maximus, the intrepid war horse, and Pascal, the Jiminy Cricket-like chameleon, don't talk (for once!), but they convey more in expressions and actions than many human characters.  A lot of the LOL funny moments (and there are MANY in TANGLED) occur with these two, and they alone are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Overall, TANGLED is charming, entertaining, and funny - a treat for the entire family.  And I really love these 21st century Disney princesses; they are strong, independent, hardworking, kind, and loving.  Exactly the kind of young women that I hope for my daughters to be., kind, and loving.  Exactly the kind of young women that I hope for my daughters to be.
B000002H97|2.0|Oof, just accidentally heard \\"Enter Blandman.\\"    It brought back, like it was yesterday, the memory of bringing this home from the record store the day it was released, popping it in the cd deck, cranking it, and realizing within 10 min this album simply blows. I don't mean incompetent. Metallica hit exactly the target they aimed for: bland, mawkish heavy pop-rock. Gone, the icily brilliant thrash band. Hello classic rock band. Sure, they picked up a lot of new fans, certainly more than they lost. But I'm one they lost for good.
B0000062S0|5.0|Some music just grabs you by the b**ls and doesn't let go. This is one of those. Just ten years ago, Page/Plant came up with an album that not only rocks, but excites your senses. It is one of the most compelling LP's I've heard since early Zep from these guys. And the backing band (drums/bass) are well picked out and complement the music perfectly. This will go down as one of my favorite \\"newer\\" albums of all time. Newer, as in not 70's/80's rock, but done with a style and class not found in many of today's acts. Robert Plant has kind of stepped into the void left by premier songwriting talent that used to be Phil Collins. Look at the diversity of work he's done with Allison Kraus...Bravo gentlemen!
B001TIQT98|2.0|The quality of the recordings aside, an incomplete box set is a very aggravating purchase! This particular collection was missing disk 7, Mahler's 5th symphony, arguably one of his more famous. This is not, apparently a total anomaly. I've experienced the problem with a box set of Maria Callas' work and spoken to others who have likewise encountered missing recordings.    The recordings, the ones that were in the box are exquisite. They Bernstein original Mahler symphonic recordings, herein digitally remastered, are near perfection.     The missing disk is probably not an Amazon shortcoming. There should however, be some way to check the contents of boxed set shipments for completeness before the issue becomes a customer problem.

B0047A72E6|4.0|Great energy and musicianship.  I was stunned at the first listen.  It's got all the great Buddy Guy edginess in the songs, vocals and guitar and a great quality in that the songs are somewhat biographical in nature and just right for this 74-year old blues musician.  Buddy and BB King on track 4, \\"thank the Lord\\" that He let them \\"stay around a little longer\\", because they've still got a lot to give... no doubt after listening to this album. The banter at the end of that track is a little corny and yet you've got to give it to them, it works, two awesome musicians sitting down and just being awed at what they've been blessed with and are still able to do.  If you enjoy blues at all, I can't recommend this album more heartily.  It's a great find.
0385738757|2.0|What do you do when you have produced a bestseller for the first time and you've got to produce volume two?  If you're Suzanne Collins and you've just published \\"The Hunger Games,\\" the solution is to write the same novel over again (except not as compellingly) and publish it with a different color cover as \\"Catching Fire.\\"  Unfortunately James Dashner has listened to the same siren song.  The Maze Runner was compelling fiction but there was always the thought in the back of the reader's head that, given the state of the real world outside the Maze, how could the technology to create the Maze actually exist.  You keep reading figuring that in the second book the author would give you some clue as to how any of this makes sense.  But no.  The Scorch is essentially the Maze redux, except not as compelling, and we still have absolutely no clue how the horrendous real world environment could possibly allow for the impossible-to-believe technological advances displayed throughout the book.  I don't have high hopes for the last installment.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I liked the setting, and the overall casting. Would not have thought Gyllenhaal would make a great action guy--but he did. and with a non-american accent. I liked it. Some actors that go into action look better all scruffed up! Good moving story and action, plot, evilness dropped in it! Can't always be totally good through out the movie. Have to muck it up a bit! Hopefully there will be another \\"story\\" with in it for a similiar or sequel to it! Good casting keeps you revetted to the screen, just where you want to be. Knowing it was shot on location is a big plus too! A must see for the fastasy inspired person!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I first read Jane Eyre several years ago and I was intriqued to experience this masterpiece in video form.  I was not disapointed in this version.  Of course the video form does not offer as much detail as the written form but this version of Jane Eyre is great.  The acting is spectacular, the actress playing Jane Eyre is very good as well as all of the supporting cast.  I especially loved Toby Stephens as Rochester, I believed Stephens truly brought Rochester to life.      This version of Jane Eyre is riveting. The first time I watched this video, I watched it from start to finish without a break, which is very difficult considering the film is almost four hours long.  This movie has everything: a great story line, great acting and great presentation.

Please do not confuse this blu ray 3D with the old fashioned cardboard glasses 3D.  This is so beyond that technology! Well worth the price to have this gorgeous movie as part of your classic Christmas traditions.

0061990477|5.0|The Thorn Birds tells the story of the Cleary family of Australia over several generations starting in the early 1900's with the childhood of Meggie Cleary and moving onwards until the late 1960's.  Their lives are intertwined with others in the close knit outback community, including Catholic clergy member Ralph De Bricassart, who will play a bigger role than any of them realize when he first enters their lives.    I found this novel captivating, moving, and heartbreaking in some parts.  The characters are excellent with all too real failures and shortcomings.  The first half was slightly more enjoyable than the second, but an overall excellent read.

The release date by distributor made sure 3 day shipping fell over a weekend.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I just got the Kindle for Christmas. I needed to download a few books for an 8 hour car trip.    My first book was one of a favorite author - I actually read a few reviews and they were all mediocre.    I bought the book anyway and liked it.    For my trip home, I didn't have anything in mind, so I just looked at the bestsellers and the description of this book intrigued me.    I read the book, and just now have read a bunch of the reviews.. and I'm glad I hadn't read them first b/c some give away the entire storyline.    I will try to avoid this in my review.        I agree that reading Jack's narration is tiresome.   I almost thought \\"how can this be such a highly recommended book\\" after reading the first chapter or so.   It was monotonous and while I suppose it can and does happen to people, way depressing for me to think that it could be real.      However I didn't catch on to the nitpicky stuff others have, like he doesn't use \\"the\\" before the nouns in his life.   Bed and Rug and Wardrobe are their names, so he wouldn't say \\"the bed\\",  etc.... Also, I just read someone else stating that a \\"wardrobe\\" in the UK is a closet- bahaaa... I never figured that out and thought it was some big piece of furniture that he slept in... I think using the word \\"closet\\" would've been much more helpful for someone like me who reads without thinking too much into details!       I agree the middle of this book is the catch - and I couldn't put it down.   I agree that Ma's interpretations of some things would've been better.   I also found it very disturbing and sad.         All in all - not a great book for me... would've liked some more closure at the end, and a better \\"voice\\" to tell the story, but that might've changed it too much and then it would be a whole other story.

B002ZG99A4|4.0|OK, I got this film and \\"The A-Team\\" at around the same time.  Christmas 2010.  Watched them both within days of one another.  To be honest, I liked \\"The A-Team\\" better, because it had more consistant action set-pieces in it and had a bit more plausible plot line going for it, yeah I said it, plausible plot line...LOL.  Anyway, not talking anything away from \\"The Expendables\\", but I thought parts of the movie dragged a bit, although the important scene, such as the monologue by Mickey Rourke really hit home, by bringing the over-all feel of the movie to the forefront.<br /><br />That said, Expendables is still an enjoyable action flick.  And because it was done as a homage to action flicks of the '80s, I believe it has a slightly softer focus than a modern film would otherwise have.  I kind of hope they do a sequel, as Rourke's character needs to go on a mission with them.  What I found great about the film though is that there was very few uses of stunt men.  Most of the stunts, fight scenes, etc. were done by the actual actors.  Stallone spent as much time in the hospital as he did shooting the film!  Separated shoulder, torn ligaments...pretty much all courtesty of Steve Austin.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention the guns?  This movie has some of the baddest guns I've ever seen.  One that looks to be a automatic {rifled?} drum-fed shotgun that rips apart anything it hits.  And shoots with a thunderous \\"THOOM...THOOM...THOOM\\" sound.  There was also a lot of good hand-to-hand fight scenes.  Jet Li vs Dolph Lungren, Statham vs a bunch of dudes, Stallone vs Steve Austin, Couture vs Austin.

B0015DROBO|1.0|I was interested in this book when I first heard about it and Larsson. I rarely read the \\"hottest bestsellers\\", because most of the time they are not my taste. I finally bought \\"...Dragon Tatoo\\", and \\"...Plays with Fire\\", together in anticipation of a long weekend of reading. I had heard many times, that it does not get interesting until after 100 pages. Usually, that is a red flag for me. I should have known better. \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\", did not get interesting until about page 320. I stuck with it because I liked the main character, but really did not enjoy the book. I wonder if something is lost in the translation, as the dialog  was uneven and choppy. I don't know. I read this in a day, and will never get that time back. I told my coworker (same one who gave the 100 page warning), what I thought and she responded that the second book is much better, and the third (\\"...Hornet's Nest\\") wasn't that great either. Really? I guess if you must jump on the same train as everyone else, read this. But, there a millions of much better books waiting to be read.

Living in North Carolina and being from the coast it is so neat to read places and settings in his books that I'm so familiar with!<br /><br />This is a great book, the topic and style is a little different than typical NS. It does revolve around some intense social / personal topics. Because of this, I found that I became even closer to the characters and drawn into the story.<br /><br />As always NS does a great job of drawing you in with the past, present and futures of each character, coupled with side stories that all merge together for a wonderful climax and closes with a fulfilling story.<br /><br />______________<br /><br />TOTAL SIDE NOTE, in the event any reps for Nicholas Sparks reads any reviews... PLEASE, I beg of you, STOP selling the movie rights to Nicholas Sparks books. Most of the movies are terrible and I think it dims the light and beauty of the novels!

B003XQM2YU|3.0|I am huge Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett fan. These are immense talents. So, what went wrong? I suspect there must have been severe script issues from the beginning, unlike Gladiator, the obvious Scott/Crowe collaboration to compare Robin Hood to, which had a richly detailed story with well-conceived and fleshed out characters. There are sparks of Scott's greatness here. Few directors can put together these types of massive battle scences, whilst keeping them focused at a human level. There are also excellent scenes showing the chemistry between Robin and the men that are willing to follow him. I found the \\"back-story\\" of Robin's \\"daddy issues\\" pretentious and irrelevant. It adds nothing to the film, and it feels like a \\"justification\\" for Robin's actions, when one is not needed. Then we have Cate Blanchett's \\"Marion\\", who is mired in a mess of poorly written scenes. This is not Blanchett's \\"fault\\", as her performance itself is a highlight of the film; however, her substantial talents are almost totally wasted. Everything in the movie, to me, seems rushed and incoherent - especially in the \\"Director's Cut\\", which makes a movie that is far too long even longer, yet adds no substantive value. Robin Hood is not Blade Runner, and the \\"Director's Cut\\" lacks purpose and intensity. Robin Hood is not a terrible movie. You have, and will, see much worse films. However, it SHOULD have been a far better outing. If you are a huge Scott fan and are itching for a \\"Historical Epic\\", you would be better served with \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", which is far from the greatness of Gladiator, however it is a much more coherent film than Robin Hood.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000SW2F6M Kingdom Of Heaven]]

I really can't figure out how this book garnered such acclaim when i had problems just trying to finish it. It's not the the writer doesn't have talent, i just believe that he wanted to accomplish a lot more than he was able to and in the end ended up accomplishing nothing at all. What really stands out to me is that the summary of the story addresses many tasks that Kvothe is said to have done in his amazing yet short lifetime, and yet none of it is addressed in this book. He doesn't (SPOILER) steal the princess, he's not expelled from the university, and he's doesn't even meet Felurian, let alone spend the night with her(him?).(END SPOILER) It's just disappointing because the back of the book tells you so many things that don't happen, and it's like you're reading a book other than the one advertised. This is only the tip of what makes for a very lackluster story. The characters are another huge issue for this book. They're all completely one-dimensional right down to the main character who for all intensive purposes might at well be a mary su. They have no depth and as a reader you're never able to connect with them. The story sort of meanders on through Kvothe's life to the point where at times i found myself forgetting what his purpose was. The Chandrian should just not exist for all the good they do the story line, and once again by the end of the book nothing has been revealed about them. After reading this book i know for a fact that i will not even be attempting to borrow the second book let alone buy it. I'm done.
0375713751|5.0|Ditto on what all the previous good reviews have stated.  As a woman who is now 30 and contemplating motherhood, this was a very insightful read.  Love Allison Pearson's sense of humor and can't wait to read more from this author.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Although I absolutely love Josh Groban, I was somewhat dissapointed in this CD.  He just didn't have the intenseness he usually has, as if he didn't like the songs he was singing. He has a gorgeous voice, but this time he just did not show it.
B0001I55SS|4.0|Read other reviews for more in-depth analysis.<br /><br />I just want to give a few thoughts...<br /><br />I saw The Black Hole in the theater on New Year's Eve 1979.  This movie has great special effects but has a mediocre story, in my opinion.  This was Disney's first attempt at a science fiction movie and actually got a PG rating.  After Star Wars (1977) and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1978) came out, soon to follow were a bunch of science fiction TV shows and movies that had great special effects, such as Battlestar Galactica (1978 & 1980), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Alien (1979), Tron (1982), E.T. Extra Terrestrial (1982), The Terminator (1984), 2010 (1984), and so on.<br /><br />I have good memories seeing this movie.  It has stuck with me for the last 31 years.  Like I said before, the special effects are better than the story, but it's good enough for me to give it a 4-star rating.<br /><br />If you like late '70s and early '80s science fiction movies, give this one a try.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|We don't purchase very many movies, but we did with this one.  It's such a good film.  The acting is great, considering the rolls these folks had to take on, and Jim Carrey is classic for his role.<br /><br />The film's length is perfect.  It isn't drawn out and dulled by nonsense scenes that seem like fillers.  The pace is fast but not too fast that you feel like you're loosing out.  I found it to be only mildly predictable as the film went on.<br /><br />One little complaint would be the far-fetched idea of the show's team working in the \\"sun/moon\\" in the sky.  They made it entirely too large to be in scale with the show's \\"set\\" if you ask me.  Other than that, everything is pretty believable for this kind of movie.<br /><br />The Truman Show was filmed largely in Seaside, Florida, which is in the panhandle.  The quaint and a little too-perfect town scenes used in the movie are actual scenes from Seaside.  You can go there today and still looks like a movie set.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|A masterpiece for a miniseries which will entertain and move a majority of viewers. The use of the moving camera technique can become a distration at times but otherwise you will most likely find it difficult not to watch the entire series in one sitting, This is not a literal account of history so do not expect a history lesson. Do expect a beautiful account of our nation's forefathers.
B003Q6D27S|2.0|I honestly got bored of the SAW franchise a long time ago. With movies like these, the movie industry wonders how come piracy has increased?    Reason 1:  The overall price to watch movies has increased. I use to be able to watch a movie at the theater for about $3.50-5.50...now with 3D it's like...what? $13-15?? Per person? The DVD of this is sold here for $19~ and the blue ray is $30?!    Reason 2:  Decline in movie quality. Remakes....remakes of remakes...drawing a movie or tv show out until it is literally boo-ed off and can no longer be milked.    Reason 3:  Higher availability of high quality pirated material.    Saw: The Final Chapter, can be a good example that fits into reason 2. I admit, it's not a horrific sequal/finale (...no more please...) But movies that have 3D in them seem to be using 3D as a clutch, substituting good plot, acting, and general movie quality for cheap effects. The term \\"ain't how it use to be\\" applies somewhere here. My problem with this final is that it is now literally a movie for people that get a kick for watching other people suffer...and that's it.     SPOILER ALERT!!  SPOILER ALERT!!    After the \\"victim\\"  fails the second time and not being able to save the second person, I already got the impression that this movie has no other objective, but to thrill the viewers with more and more scenes of gore and torture. Usually there's a surviver or so that tags along and makes you feel \\"oh okay, maybe they can survive it!\\". This movie is too predictable.    Let's see.    Who here predicted that Sean Flanery aka Bobby (the main victim of the movie) was going to get captured and that he would be the main victim of the movie?  Who here predicted that the cops, etc, that entered the 'torture' base where Bobby was being kept were being led into a trap and would die?  Who here predicted after the second victim's death that this movie was not really about the possibility of survival, but a gore fest...one after another?  Who here predictedthat his wife would die in the end?  Who here predicted that Jigsaw's wife (ex? forgot...) would die even while under police protection?    If you were the ones that were able to predict those, then congrats, you have a brain or you're experience in watching enough movies to tell.  If you weren't able to predict all that and still made a review on here...well...    Anyway...gore and torture is fine with me (even though that's a sick thought altogether) but I would like a good movie to go along with that. Please do not make anymore SAW movie.        SO TO THE MOVIE INDUSTRY, IF YOU WANT PIRACY TO STOP, STOP MAKING CRAPPY MOVIES AND LOWER THE MOVIE PRICES. BY RELEASING LOW QUALITY PRODUCTS, YOU ONLY HURT YOURSELVES IN THE END.
0743299795|5.0|Wow!!! It is amazing how everything Womack wrote in this book about the auto industry's future actually came true. What insight!!! This is also an excellent look at lean production, and how it extends beyond the walls of the organization to all of the organization's suppliers, and also to the customers.
0307387178|4.0|this book is much different than i thought it would be. it has made me think in many different ways. i would recommend it to anyone. i think a lot can be learned from this book, no matter how old you are.
030726999X|3.0|This was ok.As usually the author is long winded; however, unlike the first two books this book gave away the plot upfront then picked it apart with long winded/ unneseccary explainations. Also found it contained a lot of repetative information. But if you read the first two, then it's worthwhile to read the last of this series for the wrap up. Be mindful that you may end up skimming through a lot of pages. I actually finished it out of curiously and not because of the suspense seen in the first two. Still perplexed about the Beger events (page-fillers), as they really didn't add any substance to the book.
B001F0RA2U|3.0|Nesbo's a pretty entertaining plotter but literature this is not (and doesn't purport to be). This first of six Detective Harry Hole policers came out in 2000 (in English in 2006). It goes Redbreast, Nemesis, Devil's Star, Redeemer, Snowman, Leopard. All six essay the dubious premise that big things happen in Oslo, a world capital so small that some of the books come with a one-page street map. Nesbo's not the only Scandanavian crime writer mysteriously compelled to cite every avenue and lane in town. In Redbreast, past and present Nazis are featured, although Nesbo reports that the security police have identified 47 neo-Nazis in the whole country; in Norway, apparently, that's a lot. The Hole character is trite. Batchelor, dry drunk, smoker, rebel, constantly on the verge of getting fired . . . brilliantly intuitive and, after hundreds of pages of perplexity, rushing single-handedly, and contrary to procedure, to save the day. The books read pretty well because of Nesbo's ingenuity but it's hard for Americans to take seriously police detectives who aren't weapons-qualified and have to drive their own cars which often won't start. In sum, quaint, like a British manor whodunit, but on a national level. Who really cares whether the Norge Crown Prince might be assassinated by a psychotic? There's more feeling in Camilla Lackberg's similar series about the same small imaginary world.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|The price is right and they fit well.  The old ear tips on my bluetooth wore off and this allowed me continue using my bluetooth . . .
0307454541|4.0|I have been hearing so many good things about this series but was hesitant to pick it up due to fear it wouldn't live up to the hype.  I am glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought the book was pretty darn amazing. The main reason I did not give it 5 out of 5 stars is it did take me about 100-150 pages to really get into it.  The reason it got a 4 instead of something lower was that once it did pick up I could not put it down.  I have to warn you that there are some pretty brutal parts but it was like a car accident, I could not look away even though it was disturbing.<br /><br />None of the characters in this book are straight forward.  Mikael was an interesting character.  At times I seriously disliked him, admired him, thought he was naive and thought he was pretty ballsy.  He had an interesting sexual friendship with his best friend, Erika, who also happens to be married.  Then there is Salander who has a few screws loose, could be considered psychopathic, brilliant, antisocial and yet you come to admire her.  She also develops a complex relationship with Mikael and you never really know which way that relationship will turn.<br /><br />The mystery that Mikael is hired to look into was haunting and riveting.  It keeps you guessing with twists and turns, a myriad of interesting suspects and some unbelievable detective work on Mikael's part.  I was so into the book by the ending that my Nook wasn't turning pages fast enough.  I seriously wanted to go hide somewhere away from my husband and kids to finish this one.  If you are into murder mysteries definitely check this one out!
0765356147|1.0|I can't say I was anything other than disappointed by this book.  It had no major flaws to speak of and was generally an \\"ok\\" read but I expected SOOOO much more.  In fact I've never been more disappointed by a book.<br /><br />Mistborn was among the best books I've read in recent years.  It featured a unique world filled with compelling characters, an enthralling plot, and a real tangible antagonist.  It was the kind of book I had trouble putting down even when I knew I had to work in the morning...<br /><br />Unfortunately the Hero of Ages continued the degradation started in Well of Ascension.  I was reluctant to even read book 3 after struggling through a mediocre Well of Ascension.  Sadly, my reservations were proven accurate.  The problems I mentioned in my review of the 2nd book of the series return in force and actually get worse.  The series just never recovered from the loss of Kelsier and it just felt like the author agreed.  Did Brandon lose interest?  Did he get bored with his characters?  Did he just add two more because the first book sold so well?  I have no idea but I hope so because his usual flair was noticeably absent.  Add Elend's becoming superman which ruined him as a character...I really considered not bothering to finish.  Everything that made him remotely sympathetic just vanished in a moment of \\"really?\\".  But I persevered.  A mistake.<br /><br />The worst of all was the ending.  The final \\"battle\\" with Ruin (who made a crappy antagonist - no match for the Lord Ruler who was downright frightening) was unimpressive and anti-climactic (to the point where I started skimming just to get to the end - something I never do).  However, the bigger issue was that in such a dark world to have such a pathetically and un-fittingly happy ending where it is made clear that everyone was \\"better off\\" and \\"happy\\" and oh by the way Spook is Mistborn now just because...  It just reeked of Harry Potter-esque character coddling and cheesiness.  I was really disappointed and felt completely cheated.<br /><br />Once I finally finished the series I really wished I could unread the last two books.  I will always see Mistborn as just one great book that didn't require two more.cheated.  Once I finally finished the series I really wished I could unread the last two books.

B0044XV3R8|3.0|I really enjoy this movie and its great graphics, but I should have done better research on my own. This set requires a disc swap during the movie and that ruined my experience for a great flowing movie.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|I began watching Lost and enjoyed the adventures, cliff hangers, and beautiful scenery.  Finding out new things about the characters and making discoveries on the island was a great week to week adventure.  Then Season 6 happened.  It was pure drivel.  I understand metaphor and symbolism....this season was pure fluff.  They took a great show and completely butchered it by insulting the viewers with this horrendous pile of rubbish.  Just stop watching after season 5 and feel fortunate.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|The Tron Legacy film score comes across more than just a reprise to the original film but also serves as a tribute to the science fiction films of the past like Blade Runner, Flash Gordon, X-men, & Japan's Casshern just to name a few. Aside from the obvious touches of the classical music vibe that's pretty much embedded in all film scores,it's also somewhat reminiscent of music genre's like new ave & synthpop. Apparently this isn't the complete album but I purchased this through I-tunes which includes 2 bonus tracks exclusively only through them. I'm not a Daft Punk fan in the least but overall this a very enjoyable album to kick back & experience some other worldly escapism. Highly recommended if you like stuff like Kraftwerk or early Gary Numan.
0307346609|5.0|I hadn't read a book in quite some time(easily years).  Then I picked this book up and didn't put it down until I was finished.  It was a very good read.  Very easy to lose track of time while reading it.  I just recently read it for the third time.  Still great.
1401923119|5.0|Finally someone brave enough to print the truth. I am so glad Dr. Lipton published his findings and went against the norm Newtonian ways.

0060775858|4.0|A bedtime ritual w/my first two children, Goodnight Moon is a classic in my home. So much so that I must buy a third copy for my third child as the first two copies have worn out. The story is simple enough to have a calming effect. And when you adjust your tone of voice to the story, getting softer as you read along, it puts the little ones in a sort of transe. Sound crazy? Yeah! The illustrations are just okay, but when u read this book to an infant or toddler @ bedtime, does it really matter?<br /><br />FYI this book is available @  Babies R Us for$ 6.99...
030746363X|5.0|Tim has \\"done it again\\" with a terrific book, this is an exciting read with each sentence (practically) containing a nugget of wisdom.

B003YUC2FE|4.0|The only problem I had was the storage for the disks. The toy box holder is very cute and a good idea, but the movies are not in individual cases. Rather they opted to put slits in a foam brick. I later went out and bought a 10 pack of BD cases for around $3. After that everything is great. The BD pic is awesome and the bonus features are good to watch.
1439177783|5.0|I had difficulty putting this book down, and I do not often say this about books I have read! Ms. de Rossi has written a very insightful, informative and fascinating book, depicting her struggles with her eating disorder and the reactions of persons in her social environment. I am a psychologist in Vancouver, Canada and this book will be on my \\"recommended reading\\" list for patients, their families and other professionals.     Ms. de Rossi helps the reader to understand very clearly the internal dialogues that tend to torment individuals with eating disorders, the thoughts and emotions that underlie eating-disordered behaviours, and the healing journey iteself. Some of the external factors that are associated with eating disorders are also clearly described by Ms. Rossi, including the role of society, family, and in may cases, childhood trauma (e.g., loss of a parent), to name a few. Beautifully written and emotionally touching!!

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I read this book for the sake of argument.  The DaVinci code initially hooked me but did not stand up to a re-read.  This time it doesn`t even feel like Brown is trying.  I can`t blame him, it sells but there are better books to read.  Langdon spends a bulk of the book doing silly things, I can't even remember the lady's name since she's a carbon copy of the last two and the twist is worthy of an M. Night film
B004DCB62M|2.0|I have long been a fan of Sherlock Holmes. This is as near a complete work on the Arthur Conan Doyle work of the famous detective as you will ever find anywhere and the price cannot be beat. Doyle's work speaks for itself in the fact that the Holmes character is known as a universal classic and has been duplicated everywhere from plays to television to the big screen.<br /><br />My objection to this Kindle book is not directed at the author in any way whatsoever and I want that to be clearly understood. I am running Kindle for PC on my laptop and do not own a Kindle device. I don't know where the bug is but the formatting on this Kindle book is absolutely horrible. I tried everything that I know (and I'm a fairly advanced user) to make the formatting come out correctly but to no avail. The specific problems were that many of the illustrations were either cut in half and justified to opposite sides of the page. Other illustrations were jumbled completely. The word wrapping didn't work at all correctly in over half of the book, leaving the text for a single sentence jumbled at random on the left side of the screen. In about fifty percent of the book it was okay. The rest was horribly catastrophic.<br /><br />Like I said this could be a problem with Kindle for PC in combination with this book because other books seem to work fine. It may work fine on an actual Kindle. But I would buy a different version than this if I had to do it all over again.

0545123283|1.0|Shame on you, Scholastic!  What an editorial disaster!  Whatever happened to the basic rule of \\"Show--don't tell?\\"  Seriously, how much blah-blah can a reader be expected to endure before he or she skips to the finale of this volume or just drops it altogether?  And are YA readers presumed to be so immature and ignorant that they won't pick up on all the storyline inconsistencies, repetitions and inevitabilities?  How disappointing that this sequel to SHIVER fails so fully to deliver on its predecessor's promise.
0060936223|2.0|I was amazed when I saw a memoir win the National Book Award,and I love memoirs,and even more amazed when I read it. I don't think I would have read this until I got it as a gift, and although I'm two thirds through with it, I'm not sure its worth finishing.<br />So why is this impressive? I found it tedious at times,it had a pedestrian quality of, \\"and then this happened and then we did this, and then ...\\" which was repetitive and uninteresting. Except for the freaked out lives of \\"beat\\" artists during an interesting and freaked out period of U.S. and NYC history, if you're interested in learning about that,I'm not really that interested, then the book has maybe, niche interest for \\"followers\\" of this kind of thing. If you like people living on the \\"fringe\\" who have crazy, self-destructive artistic aspirations and who live desperate, at times almost depraved lives, then this is right up your alley. I look at it as a somewhat interesting story about a large cadre of \\"artistic\\" folks who live on the edge, but I don't find that kind of life of very much appeal. Maybe I'm too \\"bourgeois.\\"<br />The title, as one reviewer said,is a misnomer. The brand of \\"innocence\\" purveyed here is more tainted then anything else. The prose except for a few flourishes is average, nothing that interesting, and most of all I'm in total disagreement in the decision to award a book that has a minor place in history to win over hundreds of other non-fiction works of higher merit and greater quality.
0440178002|5.0|Shogun was one of the most entertaining reads in the past year for me.  Looking for action, love triangles, scheming, and great characters?  Look no further.  The historical back drop of Japan circa 1600 is also fascinating: social stratification including the samurai class, the tension of reformation Europe (English and Dutch vs. Spanish and Portuguese), and the modernization of a feudal society.  Loved it!

030746363X|4.0|This book was good.  Parts were disjointed, and it attempts to do everything at once.  Overall though, well researched, smart, intelligent approaches to diet and exercise.  There are parts which area a bit contradictory, but if you pick ONE goal you're going after and stick to that, i.e. fat loss OR muscle gain, then it is much less confusing and tracks better.    I really enjoyed reading Tim Ferriss's easygoing style, same as I did the 4 Hour Workweek.

031603438X|5.0|I had not expected this book to be as engrossing and captivating and informative as it is---I am not sure why, but nevertheless, I cannot put it down! I have been a Stones and Keith Richards fan since the 60's and find this book to not only be extremely well-written but the way Keith takes you inside what was going on in his life during whatever time period he is talking about is mesmerizing: he has you there with him at his side as he discovers the guitar for the first time; goes to art school, but sneaks off for guitar playing with others; and so on. He also lets you know who influenced him with his music from day one, which I find so interesting to know. It really is a highly enjoyable look into how this phenomenal guitarist---one of the greats of our era---got started with his guitar and became a master at his instrument and one of the great writers and performers of music ever! If you love Keith Richards and the music of the Stones, this is a book you will not be able to put down---and you will laugh at some of what he tells you, your eyes will pop at other comments, and you will marvel at how far Keith came from his humble beginnings and the fact that he never forgot where his roots were.  Bravo Keith---you are not just a master of the musical notes, but a true master of the written word as well! Love your book \\"Life,\\" and no, you obviously have not forgotten any of it!!!

B00428ZRFE|5.0|\\"Loud\\" was probably one of the most anticipated albums of 2010... did it live up to its expectations? YES.  While Rihanna's previous album \\"Rated R\\" was indeed an overall success, producing a slew of hit singles as well as a high-grossing concert tour, it was a slight disappointment for fans who liked her fun, sassy, catchy Pop songs that burned up the clubs. \\"Rated R\\" was a very dark album, reflecting the very dark phase in RiRi's life after her abuse by Chris Brown. The music on the album reflected that mood exactly, and while some praised her creativity and daringness to do something new, some felt that the album was a complete letdown.  NOW- Rihanna has returned to the dance floor with a passion. \\"Loud\\" is a nearly stellar Pop record... with only eleven songs, it manages to be, in my opinion, her finest work to date. The songs on here are all different from one another, with each of them having their own little bit of magic that make them great listens.     1. S&M (10/10)- The album kicks off with the dirtiest song of Rihanna's career... she sings \\"I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it; Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it; Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me\\" over a throbbing beat practically made for the clubs. Anyone who loves a hot, slutty dance jam will immediately fall in love with this one. Rumor has it that this will be the album's 3rd single... if so, I'm VERY curious to see the music video!  2. What's My Name (Feat. Drake) (10/10)- A slightly Carribean-style track that is one of the best on the album... the hook is probably the catchiest I've heard in quite some time, and Drake's verse just adds to the song's overall greatness. Perfect song with a beautiful music video!  3. Cheers (Drink To That) (10/10)- Just one of those songs that is perfect to play at the bar after a long week... Rihanna sings \\"Cheers to the freakin' weekend, drink to that, yeah yeah\\" while a snippet of Avril Lavigne's \\"I'm WithYou\\" plays in the background. Some may find Avril's voice (\\"yeah-a-yeah,yeah-a-yeah\\") to be annoying, but I think this song wouldn't be what it is without it. One of my overall favorites!  4. Fading (9/10)- A lot of people are dissing this song and saying that it sucks and is too generic, but honestly, I think it's absolutely beautiful. Her vocals are perfect and the hook will be stuck in your head for hours... anyone in a troubled relationship will easily relate to this one. At the end of the day, it probably is my least favorite song on the album, but it's STILL very enjoyable.  5. Only Girl (In The World) (10/10)- Probably the overall best Dance/Pop song of 2010. This one is really hypnotic and sort of puts you in a trance at first, but then you hear the EXPLOSIVE chorus and it just makes you want to dance until the end of time! STELLAR song, and one of the greatest of her entire career.  6. California King Bed (10/10)- I can't get over how gorgeous this song is... she sounds so beautiful, and her vocals just blow me away! I have yet to share this song with someone who doesn't find it to be incredible! Definitely one of the best and most emotional songs on here.   7. Man Down (100/10)- I LOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVEEEEEE this song SOOOOO much! It's my absolute favorite song she has ever done! It's basically a song about killing someone and running off so you don't go to jail for it, so it's sort of a demented and twisted track, I guess, but it's just SO damn good! She sings \\"oh, Mama, Mama, Mama, I just shot a man down in central station, in front of a big ole crowd; I better get out of here before I end up behind bars\\".... this song is SO catchy and perfect!  8. Raining Men (Feat. Nicki Minaj) (10/10)- I've heard a lot of crap about this song since the album came out, and I honest to goodness can't figure out why! I think this track is a perfect little Pop song that will most certainly be a radio hit... the lyrics are fanntastic, and Nicki's verse is totally hillarious! The best line in the whole song is this: \\"All you need to know's that I'm a 2X5, load it cock it aim it baby, BOOM, bye bye!\\"... hahahaha... SO FIERCE!  9. Complicated (9/10)- A brilliantly inventive track that shows off her diverse vocal abilities. The beat in the background is constantly changing so that it never gets boring, and the lyrics are extremely well-written. I have to be in the mood to listen to this one because it's very different and sort of eclectic, but when I do listen to it, I freaking love it!  10. Skin (10/10)- OH MY GOD... I'm going to be completely honest with you, this song will make you want to have sex! It is SO HOT and the beat is very R&B-style addicting... it even has a guitar solo at the end!!!! OMFG!!!!!  11. Love The Way You Lie (Part 2) (Feat. Eminem) (10/10)- At first, when I found out they were making a sequel to \\"Love The Way You Lie\\", I was completely outraged because I thought they shouldn't be messing with such an epic masterpiece... but when I actually heard Part 2, I fell in love with it. The lyrics are gorgeous, and you can tell Rihanna is very into this song and emotional with it because she's thinking about Chris Brown.     OVERALL- this album is fantastic, and anyone who doesn't have it who loves great Pop music should go buy it immediately, because you're really missing out!

067144901X|5.0|Besides my 9 month old twins prayer book that I read nightly, this book has to be read every day.  They smile, laugh, chuckle, watch my mouth and try to imitate every single time I read this book.  I have other animal sounds books, but this one is magic.  Sandra Boynton has some cute books, like 'Snuggle Puppy\\" and \\"The Going To Bed Book\\", but nothing compares to \\"Moo Baa La La La\\".  I will be buying this book for everyone who has/having a child!
1594488843|5.0|Very interesting insights with unique research examples. Very helpful in understanding what motivates people. If you're a marketing or business professional looking to better your product and/or sales, this is very useful.
0760335540|5.0|Wonderful book, lots of info      Picked the book, it's a good reference:  if you are a mechanic, the step by step procedure will help u avoid certain pitfalls of these wonderful cars.   If you are not into \\"Do it yourself\\", then this book helps to identify or troubleshoot the problems and you can negotiate intelligently with your dealer or mechanic.   The book almost paid for itself instantly, i had a problem with my box the mechanic suggested a $340 repair, the book helped me troubleshoot the faulty part and avoided the painful expense.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|In my opinion all Harry Potter books and movies are amazing. I would recommend them to anyone who reads a lot cause it takes a while to get through them all. J.K Rowling is a fabulous author and I love the story behind her. She was poor and homeless and with her talent of writing is now the richest women in Britain, even richer than the Queen!  It took me a while to read all of the Harry Potter books and I had to take a break because I was frustrated about how long it was taking me because I normally read a book a day and these were taking me about a week to read but they are all amazing
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is a great film, yet hard to find. I was so excited to see it on amazon and at such a reasonable price. It's like brand new, plays perfectly no problems.
B003V5PQ1E|4.0|Like the rest of the LP universe I went into shock when I first heard individual tracks from ATS.  But some times it helps to take the advice of the folks who put the music together.  Listening to the entire album, not just individual songs, the thing started to make sense and grew on me. I just hope in their explorations that they don't get anymore pop/techno.
0385732554|4.0|This is an amazing book, suggested to me by one of my peers (yes I am of College age). Many of my friends tell me they were instructed to read the book in middle school and call the topic \\"childish\\".  I suspect these people didn't read into the book as the author wanted them to, they were unable to find the deeper meaning. This book is accessible to children and adults alike. After reading this book I am definitely interested in reading the other two books in this \\"trilogy\\" for lack of a better word.
031603438X|1.0|Received this for xmas and having read good reviews was quite looking forward to reading it - what a disappointment  I trudged through the first 100 pages and finally gave up  I believe that with a ghost writer I could have written a more interesting tale of my own mundane life   stick to music and leave journalism to others
B003Y7AR4K|5.0|I'm no great lover of ballet, but this blu-ray disc could easily change that.  I've seen Russian ballet performances live, but this production blew them all away.  Everything was great!  If you like Christmas, the Nutcracker, fabulous music, or stellar dancing, you owe it to yourself to give this disc a look.  Highly recommended.
B001HN694K|3.0|I don't know.  The photography was great.  It had many of the Tim Burton fantsy peices in it, but I felt let down.  I got the feeling it was setting me up for a fantastic ending.  The ending I was waiting for never came.  I felt let down.  I'm glad I got this used and cheaply.  If I spent more money I would have felt ripped off.  Tim Burton is a great director and I feel he missed showing the spectacular story that I know he can.  I'll give him one more chance.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This is a fine, well made, gorgeously photographed film that tells the story of pure greatness.  That's all - it's a true story of genuine greatness.  Forget about surprise endings - we know what's going to happen in this story, but it's told in a way that is still thrilling.  Forget about ghoulish special effects - there are none.  And there's no contrived love story to spruce the plot up.  It's just an accurate account of a magnificent horse and it's owner.  All the actors are well cast and do a great job - and the horse that plays Secretariat ought to get an Oscar. The Tweedy inside story is very interesting and insightful.  Overall, this movie is just a well told story and an all around exciting movie with great videography, superb period costumes, good soundtrack music, and exhilarating horse racing scenes.  And it's an absolute thrill to relive one of the greatest races ever - the 1973 Belmont Stakes.  You won't regret having this movie in your collection.
B001S33D1G|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman -- and it doesn't matter if it's a kid's book.<br /><br />And \\"Coraline\\" -- now being released as a movie -- is no exception to Gaiman's track record. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (not \\"Caroline\\" is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a formerly bricked-up door that leads into an apartment in another world, which looks eerily like her own. In fact, it's so similar that she has a taloned, button-eyed \\"other mother\\" and matching \\"other father,\\" as well as a chorus of singing, dancing rats and magical toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are very attentive. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Without Neil Gaiman's touch, \\"Coraline\\" would just be another story about a kid who learns to appreciate her parents. But he infuses this story with a dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children in a mirror, beetles, disembodied hands, monsters that cling to the wall with souls in their grip, and rats that sing about how \\"we were here before you rose, we will be here when you fall.\\"<br /><br />That dark, cobwebby atmosphere clings to the increasingly nightmarish plot, as Coraline navigates a world where the other mother has every advantage. And Gaiman's wordcraft is exquisitely horrible -- the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles. And the fate of the other father is a magnificently ghastly thing.<br /><br />He even infuses poetry into the horror (\\"A husk you'll be, a wisp you'll be, and a thing no more than a dream on waking, or a memory of something forgotten\\"), and a fair amount of macabre humour (\\"I swear it on my own mother's grave.\\" \\"Does she have a grave?\\" \\"Oh yes. I put her in there myself. And when I found her trying to crawl out, I put her back\\").<br /><br />Coraline herself is a wonderful little heroine -- strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint. And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless -- who \\"wants something to love. Something that isn't her. She might want something to eat as well.\\"<br /><br />Neil Gaiman creates eerie, slightly warped worlds like nobody else, and he does an exquisitely horrible job in \\"Coraline.\\" Just never go through the door.the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Christopher Nolan once again brings us a movie with special effects to dazzle us and brilliant writing to make us think. This is a movie which bears repeat viewings because some of its ideas and plot devices can be complex. You definitely want to watch it when you're prepared to do at least some thinking - it isn't one of those \\"turn off your brain\\" and be entertained action movies (different movies for different moods). There is a lot to like here, with an excellent cast, wonderful cinematography, some interesting twists, and a core that will make you feel for some of the characters.    Cobb (DiCaprio) is an expert at getting into people's minds via their dreams and stealing information. Using a special device, he and some other specialists kidnap and drug the target individual, and then draw them into a dream world of their creation. In the dream they interact with the person and get them to reveal their secrets. All the time, the person's subconscious takes the form of people in the dream world who try to attack the invaders. If any of them die in the dream, they wake up. For some assignments, they actually create a dream within the dream in order to more completely disorient the person and have a better chance of stealing the information. There is also the risk of falling into limbo though, a world created by whoever gets trapped there and where time goes on and on. Limbo can be enticing to some because you have complete control over the world around you. The process of knowingly going into these dreams and sometimes seeing familiar places can cause one to question reality. This is where the movie starts to make you think.    Although he gets paid to do this and almost certainly enjoys his work to some degree, what Cobb wants most in life is simply to be able to see his children. Wanted for the murder of his wife Mal - of which he is innocent - Cobb is constantly on the run and cannot return to the U.S. to even see his children. During one of his assignments, heis presented with an offer he can't refuse - plant an idea into someone's mind and a call will be made to clear up the warrant for his arrest. Inception - planting an idea into someone's mind - is much more difficult than stealing information from someone's mind so Cobb puts together a team of experts to accomplish this. One member of the team, Ariadne (Ellen Page), notices that Cobb has some guilt issues which interferes with his ability to perform and even think straight at times. Ariadne pursues it to the point where she finds out what really happened to Mal. This is where the movie starts to make you feel for the characters.    The movie includes some great effects sequences and action scenes, including some where Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is tumbling around the walls of a hotel (with stunts performed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt himself). Filmed on location in cities around the world such as Paris and Tangiers, the cinematography looks amazing both in the real world and in the dreams. A couple of structural devices used by the dream designers look like they're straight out of a M.C. Escher painting.    I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a gorgeous science fiction movie which will also make you think. The dreams within dreams plot might get confusing at times, but there is an emotional core which doesn't get lost.
1416550550|5.0|I have not read anything from Kate Morton before, and was looking for a good story that would take me away for a few days. Or a couple days anyway, which is what happened with this one, since I read it almost non-stop from the moment I started. It was great storytelling, with wonderful images and allusions to fairy tales historic and contemporary. Unlike some reviewers, I did not find the jumping back and forth in time the least bit confusing. I did figure out the 'mystery' pretty early on, but that didn't lessen my interest, as I genuinely appreciated the characters, setting, and writing. I noticed some reviewers disliked certain characters, and personally, I think this is kind of besides the point. On some level all of the characters are 'archetypes' - the book is playing with archetypes and fairy tales throughout - so of course there's some 'evil' ones and some 'disturbed' ones.<br /><br />Overall, a great story, a great read.
0756405890|2.0|I bought this book based in the reviews I read but frankly this is a big book because it has many pages, thats all, there are so many pages describing adventures of a young student but after you end the book you feel exactly how you feel when you started to read it, you don´t know nothing about the characters.  The author is not very rigorous in what he describes. My feeling is that when he started to write it, his desire is to be the next Harry Potter, but he fels very short
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I must warn all who are considering this movie that are a Jane Austen fan and a purist, that this movie is NOT exactly the same as the book. However, though it is not exactly the same, I still find that this a lovely version of Austen's popular novel. Definetly one of my favorite movies in my collection so far.
B003UTUQ3E|4.0|We saw this tour at the New Haven coliseum and will never forget it......we were all leaving the arena thinking the show was over,  as Bowie had had abruptly left the stage, when suddenly we all heard the opening chords of \\"Panic in Detroit\\" and rushed back to our seats. Bowie had returned to sing one final encore and PID seemed to go for 20 glorious minutes. Unbeknownst to us at the time Mr. Bowie had been arrested for marijuana, but was allowed to finish the concert. This is a great Live show and this package is nicely put together. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because I have since learned that Earl Slick did not play that night in NY, I would have liked to have heard his solo takes on Stay and Station to Station...
B002BWP4A6|1.0|Terminally dull, subtitled, black and white foreign flick that just goes on and on without even the satisfaction of a dull conclusion.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Really just a fun fun movie for the whole family.  Had everyone watching this one including ages 3, 9, 15, 34, etc. up to grandmom.  It did not disappoint keeping everyone's attention for the whole movie!  The plot was way more then I was thinking we were going to see so that was a bonus.  Graphics/animation were very well done to be sure!  I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age group!
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love this tv series.  If you like this, I would also recommend buying the movie in blu ray.  It's all good.
B001EO2UJK|4.0|I'm a huge fan of both the Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins eras of Genesis but two of my favorite albums of the band are from the Gabriel era.  To me their 6th and final album with Peter Gabriel is their finest work.  Sure, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway may seem a bit excessive being a double album and a conceptual one at that but musically, if not thematically, it works well.    The band were at their peak form and although the next few albums were still \\"classic\\" Genesis (though each one less so) even without Gabriel, to me they sound their most cohesive, dynamic and powerful on this album - even if Tony Bank's criticisms would lead you to believe otherwise.    I've wanted this box set since it was released for a 5.1 remix of that album alone (well and for Selling England By The Pound to a slightly lesser degree) and finally received it for Christmas last week.  Reading some of the reviews here though, specifically those of the one star variety, I kept thinking to myself, \\"ok, it can't be THAT bad\\". But here I am a week later and somewhat agreeing with those criticisms.    So why the 4 stars?  Well, first of all the content itself, the albums, are great.  Secondly, the 5.1 remixes are excellent and reason enough for anyone to pick up this box set.  Listening in 5.1 DTS is a revelation - everything is so clean, crisp and NATURAL sounding, the mixes are not at all gimmicky.  It sounds more like you're listening to the album played in a live environment. The mixes are well thought out, nicely balanced and not compressed sounding at all.  Thirdly, there's all the bonus content: revealing interviews, great live footage, slide show from the Lamb tour, it's all worth it.    Now the CDs... wow.  In all honesty, I've only listened - or tried to listen - to the Lamb CD and as soon as the first track began I just knew all the detractors were right.  Talk about the LOUDNESS wars!  None of the instruments have space to breathe and the drums which actually sounded ok if a bit too low in the mix on the 90s remasters, sound horribly compressed.  I just previewed each track and it was the same. Like they pushed every instrument up to the same loud level and compressed the hell out of it.  It's a shame really - I didn't mind the 90s remasters so much, my main criticism was that they lacked a bit of detail so I was just hoping that these remasters would just improve on those. I guess I still have to give the other albums a listen though before I cast final judgement but if they're anything like the Lamb remix/remaster then I will definitely stick to my 90s CD versions.    In the end, I'm still extremely pleased since like I mentioned before, the only reason I wanted this was for the 5.1 DTS versions and extras and they definitely delivered with these. Still, I think those reviewers who rated it low due to the CD versions have a right to be upset. Seems like they really did drop the ball big time.  But at the same time, to pick this up without having a 5.1 system is a real shame.  In my opinion, that's the highlight of these releases.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I'd have to say that my expectations were very high after reading some of the reviews of the mono recordings. As a lover of The Beatles and of music in general I was prepared to be amazed.  After receiving the albums I first ripped them using FLAC to get the best sound I could from a Sony mp3 player. And then listened. And listened. And listened some more.   Hmmm. What was all the fuss about?  I quit listening and decided that maybe I was too used to stereo to enjoy the mononess (I may be the first human to use this word)of these recordings. Then on a recent day I played them again just to hear the songs and for no particular reason that I am aware of, I began to hear the voices and instruments in a very clear and distinct way and also began to notice the differences from the stereo recordings in a lot of the songs.   The sound is tighter and a little stronger and that fake stereo of the early albums isn't a distraction. The sound is very real and present.  So, luckily, I now see (or hear) what the fuss is about and I'm happy that I have these remastered mono recordings as they do give the listener a different take, and a good one, on the music of The Beatles.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This is one of the first movies my grandchildren want to watch on a rainy day when the come to visit. This DVD is to replace an old well used VHS tape. Have to make sure it holds up. The movie is ageless and can be seen by all.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Love this movie, a quiet and very underrated movie. Love the mixture of fantasy and love's reality. I would highly reccomend this to all .
B000RZIGVS|1.0|The packaging for this set is the cheapest of the cheap, but what was even worse is that the discs don't play. I had to get a refund from Amazon because the seller ignored my emails for a refund. Do not buy from this seller!
0060936223|5.0|An incredibly well written and beautiful piece of prose. This is a wonderful book about the love between two friends.  Patti Smith narrates the story the only way a true friend can: by celebrating the honest beauty of another.  This is the best book I have read in some time. Beautiful.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This movie is great.  Saw it at theaters, couldn't wait till it came out on DVD.  It looks great on Blu-ray and I get enough of this film.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|The AMD Phenom II X6 1090T Black Edition is an excellent processor, love it, just love it. I'm running it now together with the Corsair H70 Hydro (water cooler), and I get around 25-40 degrees Celsius depending on what I'm doing (BOINC, gaming etc.) and when I'm running BOINC, it's constantly running six work units simultaneously all the time, and very fast. On top of that, I can BOINC with my ATI GPU together with the X6 1090T (which means, it runs 6 work units and administers a seventh work unit the GPU is calculating).    Everything runs flawlessly on this CPU. I've tried it in GNU/Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Linux Mint and Kubuntu), works excellent here as well. Windows XP Professional x86 and Windows 7 Ultimate x64 run blazing fast with this processor. I have yet to overclock it though, and I'm probably not going to bother because there's no need for it, and if overclocked, you won't be able to set it on lower CPU-frequencies in Ubuntu (If I remember correctly, the lowest is at 800MHz), and there's really no need to overclock this processor because it's awesome already out of the box.    It would've been better if it had as much L3 cache size as the Intel Core i7 980X Extreme Edition (6MB vs 12MB), and also lower nanometer (45nm vs 32nm), but other than that, I have no complaints, and the important thing here is it has six cores at an excellent price and high clock frequency. You simply get more bang for the buck with AMD.    There's also a new Thuban out (1100T), which is a slight upgrade over the 1090T. I recommend the 1090T though since it's cheaper and you don't get much more performance out of the 1100T since it's pretty much identical aside from a 100MHz increase in clock-frequency and a higher price.    I'm also looking forward to AMD Fusion.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|It's good to complete your collection. They're slowly starting to get better each film. Getting it from Amazon at a good price and free shipping was amazing though! I recommend buying from Amazon to everyone!! :)
081297381X|2.0|The basic premise of this book is quite fascinating and interesting. However the author becomes mesmerized by his own brilliance and the book is a poorly written, verbose platform for showcasing the author's high impression of his own wit and cleverness. Do yourself a favor and give it a miss.
1151097764|5.0|I have seen so many passing references to Tom Wolfe's first novel, Bonfire of the Vanities, as a modern classic, that I thought I should finally read it (I never saw the movie either); yet, I was worried that, in the 24 years since its publication, it might have become dated and irrelevant.  I had no need to worry.  The New York City and Wall Street of the 1980s has not changed much and with the focus of the 2008 great recession as a new point of reference, Bonfire of the Vanities has an immediacy that belies the passing of a quarter of a century.  The characters and the situations related in the novel are contemporary, and above all, the book tells a very, very good, indeed exciting, story.  It is easy to predict that Bonfire of the Vanities will remain in print indefinitely and will continue to be read by readers like me, who value good and pleasurable writing, centered around plausible and relevant plots.  I now plan to watch the 1990 movie adaptation starring Tom Hanks.
B000WQWPKA|4.0|good deal
B002PNAY9C|5.0|I really like the series, the things that happen in this book very interesting, Who his true father is, about his sword, his mentors last wish, about the dragons hearts and so on. Theres so much content and so much information packed in these books. Just love it. Can't wait til the fourth book comes out. If you listen to the audiobook at the very end theres a interview with the author thats tells a little info about the next book. The book fills in a lot of answers that the previous books have asked. I love long reads and would recommend this series to just about anyone
1573300403|1.0|So....I bought this for my 9 year old son for Chrsitmas becuase he is a very musical little boy in song and dance. Who better to see than Michael Jackson? I was so very wrong. Side A was awesome, however when we started to watch side B a whole different Michael Jackson image appreared. The one I wanted to \\"protect\\" my 9 year old from. The worst was with his sister Janet, who in this video was grabbing her breasts, flipping everyone off into the Camera, and standing in front of a toilet as if to \\"pee\\" like a man. I don't care WHAT the twisted message was trying to convey, my son and I were appauled. After that, was a video of Michael rising from a pond with angel wings attached to his back as we watch him emerge from the water. So....what's wrong with THAT picture. Both the first DVD and this version is \\"Not Rated\\", but I will not risk buying the first one after that shock attack!!!! Certainly wish that I could get my $$ back for this one!!!!!! Absolutely disgusted!
0143039601|5.0|Known as one of Kerouac's crown jewels, The Dharma Bums is a part self-biographical story about Ray Smith, a wandering, alcoholic, Buddhist poet who travels the USA looking for, well, whatever it is wandering, alcoholic, Buddhist poets look for when they travel around in search of something; enlightenment, solitude, experience, peace. For someone like myself, who is well traveled, interested in spiritual practice, and at the same time a budding writer, this book was inspirational in many aspects, giving me the push to explore writing in various forms, and to try to break out of the box when it comes to thinking and experience.<br /><br />Some of his paragraphs stretch the boundaries of traditional sentence structure for sure--but they still work.<br /><br />\\"Then suddenly everything was just like jazz: it happened in one insane second or so: I looked up and saw Japhy running down the mountain in huge twenty-foot leaps, running, leaping, landing with a great drive of his booted heels, bouncing five feet or so, running, then taking another long crazy yelling yodelaying sail down the sides of the world and in that flash I realized it's impossible to fall off mountains you fool and with a yodel of my own I suddenly got up and began running down the mountain after him doing exactly the same huge leaps, the same fantastic runs and jumps, and in the space of about five minutes I'd guess Japhy Ryder and I (in my sneakers, driving the heels of my sneakers right into sand, rock, boulders, I didn't care any more I was so anxious to get down out of there) came leaping and yelling like mountain goats or I'd say like Chinese lunatics of a thousand years ago, enough to raise the hair on the head of the meditating Morley by the lake, who said he looked up and saw us flying down and couldn't believe it.\\"<br /><br />Yup, that's one sentence. The stream of consciousness style for which Kerouac would be known for is exemplified in examples like this one in The Dharma Bums, and that style is a good counterpart to the Buddhist meditation he was beginning to be involved in; being, observing, flowing, not controlling, letting what will happen, happen. This style of writing, and the entire story for that matter, is about freedom and spontaneity.<br /><br />I must say I felt tinges of sadness and reverie as I read; his descriptions of the San Francisco Bay area, the California coast (where I happened to live for some time, also as a young Buddhist), coupled with the adventurous spirit of his spiritual comrades made me long for the fog and windswept trees of the California coast and a time of life filled with little care or responsibilities beyond spiritual matters. But such is the Buddhist teaching of life and impermanence; nothing lasts. Alas, that time may be gone for me, but the endless pursuit for spiritual meaning continues in my life, and that spirit also lives on in the pages of The Dharma Bums.t to the Buddhist meditation he was beginning to be involved in; being, observing, flowing, not controlling, letting what will happen, happen.

0525423273|1.0|I love YA and was excited to read this after many authors I enjoy talked about how great the book was. I was very disappointed. The main character, Anna, seems desperately hokey. She says things like \\"oh heavens\\" while ruminating on how \\"beautiful\\" St. Clair is. I don't know any 17-year-olds who constantly think how \\"beautiful\\" their crush is. In fact, the more she went on and on about his looks, the more I wondered: is she interested in anything else about him? It didn't seem like it. They had no deep conversations. Their interactions barely consisted of anything more than \\"you have good hair\\". How many times does Anna think and think and think about St. Clair, going over the same \\"I like him but I can't like him b/c he has a girlfriend\\", ad nauseam. The writing was very manipulative--by this I mean, if the characters behaved sincerely, the hijinks would not work and hence, there would be no story. There wasn't much of a \\"love story\\" to begin with. I read a lot of YA and have yet to find an author that is able to create realistic, relatable, and interesting characters the way Sarah Dessen does it. If this book is what passes as excellent YA, Dessen certainly does not have to worry about being dethroned as the Queen of YA anytime soon.  For those of you seeing a book with real story and real characters, please check her out. You will be amazed by the difference.

B0021L8V0W|3.0|I had very little interest in seeing this when it came out.  Reviews proclaimed that Angelina Jolie was the female Bourne - and I assumed that meant Lara Croft with a bit more smolder and sweat, in a slightly more realistic setting.  No thanks.<br /><br />But I was wrong.  I really liked this.  Salt is every bit as intense as the Bourne trilogy, and Jolie pulls it off with style.  It's not at all plausible, but neither is Bourne; and in both series the non-stop action kept me so engaged I never had time to wonder whether it made any sense until afterwards.  While it's happening it's simply intense and exciting, and kept me guessing.  I did anticipate the major twist towards the end, but it was still a lot of fun to watch.  The basic set up - of a defecting KGB agent, who tells the CIA that Salt is a sleeper double agent, allegedly as his only way to get her activated and give her a mission - is pretty far fetched when you stop and think about it.  The action also, is over and above what's humanly possible - but it's rendered so precisely that you don't get lost while it's going on.  What struck me, afterwards, is that Salt managed to achieve the same intensity as, say, the Bourne Ultimatum, but without the lack of clarity that you find in that film due to the shaky camera and jump cuts.<br /><br />Salt's a fun flick - an intense and exhilarating, non-stop, keeps-you-guessing spy game.  It looks great on Blu-Ray, and includes an extended edition and director's cut.  The director's cut is the best - it adds a bit more graphic violence, but also gives a bit more clarity about the characters and their relationships.
B00402FGEE|5.0|Of all the Christmas presents I got my boyfriend, this was his favorite. Delivery was very quick, and the price was the best I could find anywhere! I appreciate it!
B000FC12Z0|5.0|Great plot and story, a very unsuspected ending to me at least. I just love how Agatha Christie describes all the details of the characters and how you can picture it in your mind so well. Also I just like Poirot's approach to the case. The Miss. Marple mysteries are ok but Hercule Poirot books always seem better.

0312427565|5.0|Those who are familiar with the theatrical version of [[ASIN:0790731541 The Right Stuff]] will likely question whether actually reading the underlying book should bother.  I know I sure felt that way, even after acknowledging that the book was likely better.  But some compelling aspects of the novel are worth exploring on one's own.<br /><br />Wolfe's fascinating imagery, for example, showing how John Glenn, Alan Shepard, and the remaining astronaut lot dethroned the old guard is one aspect worth experiencing.  Another is the retelling of each astronaut's marvelous flight.  The depth, detail, and imagination radiating from the page perfectly captures the novelty of the time, exciting even for those who can only know a world where space flight is somewhat commonplace.  Chuck Yeager's final flight in the experimental NF-104A, his last record breaking attempt, is equally eye opening.  The political wrangling between NASA, the Air Force, and others that was critical to the Apollo program's success, while much less exciting, is no less essential to understanding the anxiousness of a country living in the shadow of the apparently unstoppable Red Menace.<br /><br />For all these reasons, Wolfe's nonfiction novel is truly a testament to the bravery, ambition, and determination of all of these men and to the country who was determined to cast their silhouettes among the stars.  All who are interested in the rise of the world's premier space program should take the extra time to experience it.

0553584537|5.0|This is a truly amazing book.  You often see such phrases as \\"nonstop thrills,\\" \\"the suspense never lets up,\\" or \\"cliffhanger after cliffhanger,\\" but a book almost never lives up to that hype.    This one does.  I'll leave the plot summaries to other reviewers and concentrate on Gardner's artistry, which is considerable.  The setup for the plot is highly unusual; I've never read another book about a police sniper, let alone one who gets persecuted for doing his job.      As for the characterization, while all of the characters are interesting, Catherine Gagnon swamps them all in her complexity.  She is not only far more interesting than nearly every fictional character I've ever encountered, including series characters.  She's also more intriguing than just about any real person who has ever lived.  She is shown from so many different perspectives, both her own and those of the other characters, that the reader is left constantly guessing as to who she really is.  Is she a tragically misunderstood, emotionally-crippled woman who has never recovered from an unimaginably cruel crime committed upon her when she was just a child?  A classic film noir femme fatale?  A loving mother who will do anything to protect her son and find a cure for his mysterious illness?  A sadistic nutjob who makes her child sick so she can get attention for herself?  A battered wife?  An adultress who manipulated her husband into threatening her so she could get him killed by the police?  All of the above?  None of the above?    If Alone has a fault, it's that Catherine is so endlessly fascinating that when she is not on the page, some of the air goes out of the story and the reader's interest can't help but flag.  Fortunately, Gardner's plot is complex enough, with enough twists and turns--some of them completely unexpected--that it keeps the reader going until Catherine reappears on the scene.  And while the conclusion is satisfying, it still leaves the reader wanting more.  This one is notto be missed.
B0042VJK9U|3.0|The product itself is original, you get the latest Linkin Park CD, however, its very important to mention that the Gundam itself (the transformer look-a-like figure) is NOT built and ready to use, you actually need to assemble it yourself and it has hundreds of small parts and the instructions are in Japanese.   It took about 6 hours to assemble and it was very difficult.
B003X2O6KW|1.0|I don't get the hype surrounding this release.  I bought this release because it seems to be on everyone's best of the year lists.  There seems to be this idea that rapping is some kind of a fantastic new musical invention.  In a lot of cases with hip hop i quite like the actual music then along comes this rapping and everything good is ruined.  Rapping seems to have these mindless rhymes which seem childish and somehow just plain stupid and come across as cold and unfeeling, lacking any emotional resonance. People see this as cool and modern and hip.I just see it as bad.  Whereas singing soars and expresses feeling and emotion and gives a direct link between the singer and listener,an emotional connection.  Rapping comes across as a try hard attempt at telling me a story using words that often do not fit well together and are somehow done as a kind of improvised poetry and thus suffers from a similar fate as improvised jazz.It never seems polished.   The subject matter of this release is enough to put you off alone.Just because you can swear and be arrogant does not make a great record.I am now fully aware that i am not interested in Kanye Wests dark twisted fantasies.I realize most music is about the person who created it, love, lost love, death, etc. but most people do it such a way as it relates to others. this is just Kayne West telling us how great he is.Self indulgent nonsense.The music is great,just ruined by Kanye West.   This record in about 12 months will be in the bargin bins the world over for a couple of bucks. If your not sure to buy it or not then i would advise wait and pick it up later on.This is a masterpiece of self indulgence.  If you like intelligent rhymes get a copy of a John Cooper Clark record he used to do intelligent rhymes long before most of these modern (C)rap guys,Or maybe even the last poets or Gil Scott Heron who released a great record this year.  My beautiful dark twisted fantasy, more like your ugly dark twisted personality. Do not believe the hype.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I've been a fan of SRV since Couldn't Stand The Weather (heck, In Step may have been the last vinyl LP I bought). I do have everything officially licensed by the Vaughan estate, and got to see him 8-10 times before his passing. Even though I already had the In Session CD, I jumped for the CD/DVD package. I'm sure glad I did. The early 80's footage of SRV in action was a joy to see. Even more, I have to admit, this was probably the best Albert King on video I have EVER seen (even as a blues collector for over 25 years)! Even more, the interplay between these two greats is PRICELESS. From each at times providing rhythms and fills for the other's leads, to the friendly verbal rapport, to the happy laughter often seen from one to punctuate comments (or some challenging guitar) from the other. I simply can't recommend it enough. (By the way, if I seem a bit biased toward the Blues and SRV, you might bear in mind rounding out my top 3 favorite artists are Bruce Springsteen & Frank Zappa.)
038073186X|4.0|4.5 stars, rounded to 4<br /><br />For me, this was a perfect mystery novel:  Intellectual, highly evocative of time and place, insightful of the human mind, and not too gory or violent; a psychological thriller with a great ending.  It's hard to review, though, because this is the kind of book about which almost anything I say could be a spoiler.<br /><br />It's also the kind of book you have to read twice to fully understand.  You see everything in a whole new light and notice all kinds of new details once you know the ending.  But don't be tempted to read the ending first even if you only want to read it once, because the surprise of the ending is crucial to full enjoyment of the book.  I didn't read it twice, but I did see the movie before I read the book, and watched it again while I was reading the book.  Which is virtually the same thing as reading it twice, since the movie follows the book very closely, not changing anything, just leaving out some of the details.  Even the dialogue is the same.  The first time I saw the movie, I did understand what happened but wasn't sure how everything fit together.  After experiencing the story again while reading the book (and which explains things better, of course), I delighted in seeing how all the pieces of the puzzle beautifully fit into place so that everything made sense.<br /><br />Unlike the movie, the book does not explicitly describe the actual deaths of the murdered children, nor are their deaths gory.  (The movie sneaks in plenty of blood by showing a dream sequence about the deaths which is very gory.)<br /><br />Readers who are seriously into the mystery genr&eacute; and thus read more mysteries than I do might find it more predictable.  My teenage son picked up on some clues that escaped me, and he did guess the ending.<br /><br />I enjoyed learning about the way mental illness was viewed and treated during the 1950's.  It was particularly interesting to look back on it from today's perspective.  In most ways, today's treatment is much better, but in some ways the attitudes of 50 years ago were preferable.  For example, in the book a narcoleptic was confined in the institution.  Putting such a person in an asylum for the criminally (violent) insane was definitely a stretch; and of course there is no reason why a person with that condition should require imprisonment at all.  But at least society did see a need to provide full care for someone with such a disabling medical condition.  Today people with narcolepsy as well as those with various mental illnesses are just handed a prescription (which may or may not work, or may not be taken as directed) and left to sink or swim on their own, unless they are lucky enough to have family who is willing to help them.<br /><br />The vivid portrayal of what it was like to live in a 1950's mental institution was especially poignant to me, as my grandfather was confined in such a place around that time due to a bacterial infection which permanently and progressively damaged his brain.  He lived there until his death almost 20 years later.<br /><br />This isn't a lightweight action mystery.  Understanding all the details of this book requires some focus, but it is so interesting that the concentration comes easily.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I collect knives as a hobby and sell them in my business. I have run across good sharpeners, bad sharpeners and some that im indifferent about. This product is worth every penny and for a pocket sharpener the ceramic tool leaves a nice sharp blade. I am a hunting guide in the Ozark Mountains and having availability to get this type of blade on a knife in a moments notice is very important when skinning a kill. I have never left a review on any product much less sharpeners but felt this product was worth the time and the effort. I am ordering more to give out on my hunts and teach the hunters importance of keeping a blade sharp when out in the woods for days. This product actually improved my business as well helped with my hobby. For 8-9 dollars I cant remember anything in that price range that I have enjoyed so much
B0041KKYEW|5.0|\\"Black Swan\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Nina is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth Macintyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.     The cast led by Natalie Portman (in her superb, Oscar-winning performance as Nina), Vincent Cassel (as Thomas Leroy) & Mila Kunis (in a solid performance as Lily) is brilliant! The directing by Darren Aronofsky (he also directed \\"Pi\\" (1998, also wrote the story & screenplay), \\"Requiem For A Dream\\" (2000, also wrote the screenplay), \\"The Fountain\\" (2006, also wrote the story & screenplay) & \\"The Wrestler\\" (2008, also produced), he is also directing the upcoming \\"The Wolverine\\" (2011), he also executive produced \\"The Fighter\\" (2010) is brilliant!

This is a brilliant film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time. This is a well-made and well-crafted film. Darren Aronofsky has got another brilliant film on his hands. Natalie Portman gives a superb, Oscar-winning performance and Mila Kunis is just as impressive as her exact opposite. This is one ofthe best films of last year and it will be remembered when the Oscars are eventually announced.

0525951652|3.0|After I closed this book, I gave some thought to what consistently disappointed me about it.<br /><br />I am very interested in the period of history covered by FALL OF GIANTS and over time I've read several histories of the era. I don't claim to be an expert but I think I can claim some knowledge of the time period (1911-1923) covered in this work of fiction.  I write that because I imagine many readers of FALL OF GIANTS and of this review will think:  Gee, she's taking a work of FICTION pretty seriously - she should lighten up!  But I can't lighten up when it comes to historical fiction, if only because I think it's important that such fiction be rooted in fact.  I think any author that gets important but easily acertainable facts wrong, they should be called out.  Also, fictional characters should have life-like qualities, and be engaged in life-like situations, IF their author is is truly aiming to write a fine, outstanding book (and not just a template for television miniseries).<br /><br />Something was bugging me about the characters in this book, from its beginning.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it, then after a few more chapters, I realized I was staying on the \\"outside\\", uninvolved with these characters - mostly because so many of these characters were so puppet-like.  In other words, the author had all his characters' strings showing - clues and hints were too obvious and there was a sense of predictability about what was going to happen in the case of almost every character.<br /><br />For example:  SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER - From the instant I read that Ethel worked for the Earl Fitzherbert, and that she's young and very attractive, I just `knew' she was going to end up sleeping with 'Fitz'.  And she did.  Somehow I `knew' Fitz's attempts at withdrawal during sex wouldn't be successful, and Ethel would fall pregnant.  And she did.  And there would be anger, bitterness and injustice, and yet Ethel would somehow come up on top in the end.  And she did.  **(END OF SPOILER<br /><br />The main American character, Guy Dewar, was handled clumsily, I thought.  The love life that Mr. Follett gives Guy is pure soap opera. (SPOILER ALERT) He lurches from woman to woman - three women, by the end of the book, before he finally finds true love.  Frankly, I hardly believe Guy \\"loved\\" any of the three.  END OF SPOILER  His interaction with Woodrow Wilson is just plain dull.  We learn something about Wilson - that he types his own speeches; has bad teeth (mentioned at least twice) and has high blood pressure - but little else.  Gus is just a receptacle for the historical Wilson's actions, and acts as a cipher to give the American POV, while the war in Europe plays out.  Guy is flat as a pancake.<br /><br />And when it came to the character of Guy's last girlfriend, Rosa Hellman ... eesh.  This is going to sound very strange but whenever Rosa was on the scene, I couldn't help thinking of a certain actress - her name escapes me, but she was the actress with a laconic delivery, who played the girl who lied on Finch's behalf so he'd look like a stud, in the movie \\"American Pie\\".  Rosa seemed drawn with about as much depth.  She's given a blind eye; works as a newspaper reporter, and has a past as an \\"anarchist\\" (particularly unbelievable).  Aside from this there's little to distinguish her from that semi-sarcastic, caustic high school girl who tells it like it is, in that silly, sometimes funny movie.<br /><br />But the true letdown for me was the development of Billy Williams's character.  I actually liked the Welsh portion of the book very much, beginning with the portrait of Billy's first day in the mine; the descriptions of the miners, the details about his parents and grandfather (which remain consistent, and let them become fully-realized characters that a reader can care about).  {SPOILER ALERT}  Then the author chose to have Billy - previously strongly religious, known as Billy-with-Jesus - lose his faith at age 16 after amine explosion and following his father's rejection of his pregnant sister.  It makes perfect sense that Billy would question and doubt his faith in God at this challenging time, but when he absolutely lost his faith -bang! zoom! Gone! - with such absolute suddenness (basically at his first challenge, one could say), the author had Billy lose a compelling piece of his character.  It's so rare to encounter a truly religious character in a novel (who doesn't behave like an idiot).  I would have liked to see Billy carry on in faith through this first challenge, and then perhaps, build on more doubt/conflict later when he experiences trench warfare.  I would have preferred to see this inner conflict over the one which Mr. Follett (again somewhat predictably) chose to give to Billy:  rolls in the hay with Mildred, a somewhat trampy woman with bunny teeth and a heart of gold.  {END SPOILER}<br /><br />{FURTHER SPOILER} The (mercifully brief) part of the book where Fitz and his Russian wife Bea travel to Russia in the middle of the war, and witness Bea's brother's death, is probably THE worst part of this book - absolutely terrible, unbelievable, melodramatic, and ridiculous. {END SPOILER}<br /><br />Bea, Fitz's Russian Princess wife, is another character who like Guy Dewar is flat as a pancake - she's just \\"there\\", sometimes to be a sulky blond sex toy, and sometimes to provide some witchy conflict for Fitz, but she's not a real person in any sense.  I even found her name unbelievable.  Her name is Elizaveta but she's called Bea.  This nickname makes no sense to me.  Isn't Bea short for Beatrice?  She's even known as Bea when she's a child, in Russia.<br /><br />What can I say I LIKED about Fall of Giants?<br /><br />1  Grigori Peshkov, the Russian factory worker turned revolutionary.  I admired everything the author did with Grigori.  His war service is outstandingly well written, his interaction in the Russian Revolution is believable, and Grigori is the nucleus to be THE memorable character of this trilogy.  If I continue to read the other two books (and I have to say it's still strongly an \\"if\\"), I'll do it to see where Mr. Follett takes Grigori.<br /><br />2  I liked the character of Walter von Ulrich, and mostly liked what the author did with this character - although, it occurred to me that a man who respected England as much as Walter did, had many English friends, and was married to an Englishwoman (secretly), would have asked to be permanently posted to the Russian front instead of fighting in France against the British.  This request was made by many Germans and Austrians in the same situation.<br /><br />Writing about Walter's situation reminds me of the really, really big disappointment I had with FALL OF GIANTS.  This paragraph will contain SPOILERS - so be warned.  There's a scene that takes place just after the battle of the Somme (which began on July 1, 1916 and continued into November, in varying intensity) which takes place in Aberowen, the small Welsh mining town that's the hometown of Billy and Ethel Williams.  This particular scene takes place in late July.  Ethel goes home for a brief visit, having relocated to London after her pregnancy and the birth of her child.  She stands in a doorway and witnesses a telegraph boy delivering telegram after telegram to nearly all the families that Ethel has known all her life - telegrams that announce the death of man after man.  Or boy after boy, in some cases.  The women receiving them fall about in agony.  It's obvious the author means for this to be THE crucial scene, the set piece, the one that \\"gets\\" to the reader, and it's not incidentally the experience that carries Ethel even more strongly into the peace movement.<br /><br />But, once again something wasn't sitting right with me, and when I finished the book, I figured out what it was.  I consulted UNKNOWN SOLDIERS, by Neil Hanson, and was reminded of what I'd read before:  The class system in Britain, which rigidly kept a person in a particular place in life, carried over in death - even a death that occured in the defense of one's country.  Lower class people did NOT receive telegrams announcing the death of their loved ones.  They were MAILED an official form 3 to 4 weeks after the death of their loved one.  Often, the only hint that parents or wives had that anything might have happened was the fact that they stopped receiving field postcards or letters.  Then they had to sit and wait it out for these weeks, until the army clerks got the names determined; an official form was mailed, and the CO had the time (during ongoing battles no less) to write a letter with details of the death.<br /><br />That's the kind of emotional warfare the class system carried on in Britain during World War I - making a wife or mother wait, maybe three weeks after a battle, in the sudden silence from their men - making them wait in severest anxiety for some word about their fate - because they were \\"lower class\\".  The upper-class family got the telegram.  It would be equally devastating, but at least they would know within a few days after a battle, not weeks.<br /><br />If Mr. Follett didn't care enough (or, didn't research enough) to make this distinction... well then, the reader now has an idea of the quality of this potboiler.  I think in all fairness, FALL OF GIANTS has good moments, readable moments, but when the author drops the ball many times, both in character depiction and historical research, it's frustrating.  It becomes little more than a soap opera instead of a realistic portrait of a society in flux.  In the end, I was relieved I'd spent no money, and only borrowed FALL OF GIANTS from the library.ooks (and I have to say it's still strongly an \\"if\\"), I'll do it to see where Mr. Follett takes Grigori.    2  I liked the character of Walter von Ulrich, and mostly liked what the author did with this character - although, it occurred to me that a man who respected England as much as Walter did, had many English friends, and was married to an Englishwoman (secretly), would have asked to be permanently posted to the Russian front instead of fighting in France against the British.  This request was made by many Germans and Austrians in the same situation.   Writing about Walter's situation reminds me of the really, really big disappointment I had with FALL OF GIANTS.

B001R4KQDE|5.0|This movie is beautiful in HD. Wonderful addition to my Blu-Rays. I highly recommend it. Came on time and in the right condition.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Remastered by the same team that did the individual Beatles albums, the \\"Blue\\" the second part of this \\"Best\\" of (the first is \\"The Beatles: 1962-1966\\") isn't as flawed as that set and has a nice selection of key album tracks and singles from the band's albums. Largely selected by the marketing department at Capital at the time with input from George Harrison and a tiny bit from John Lennon, this set runs nearly 90 minutes.<br /><br />We get the band's complete singles from the late 60's and early 70's (minus George Harrison's single b-side \\"The Inner Light\\" which was the b-side of \\"Lady Madonna\\")as well as key album tracks including the clean opening version of \\"A Day in the Life\\".<br /><br />The sound is quite good for this collection but keep in mind that these do suffer from some mild limiting and some compression was used to make this collection sound a bit more \\"modern\\" (i.e., \\"loud\\")like contemporary recordings. Still, what the Abbey Road team did for the songs included here seems like a nice compromise as they don't suffer from the extreme compression of a contemporary CD and overuse of digital noise removal (something the previous set did suffer from).<br /><br />Is there any reason to get this if you have all the remasters? Not unless you want the \\"clean\\" opening of \\"A Day in the Life\\"; the mixes presented here are the same as those for the previous edition on CD (some had hoped that the original stereo mix of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" would be included since it never has appeared on CD).<br /><br />The artwork is faithfully reproduced with a gatefold heavy cardboard sleeve and a booklet with info on the release and songs. Highly recommended if you want to have something that provides highlights to The Beatles career although it could have been improved with a couple of additional songs from the band's albums \\"The Beatles\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" since the running time of the CDs would have allowed it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002UYZ 1962-1966 (The Red Album)]] is also recommended although, again, more tracks from \\"Revolver\\" and the single b-side \\"Rain\\" should have been included on that 2 disc set (which could have been put on one CD).tracks from \\"Revolver\\" and the single b-side \\"Rain\\" should have been included on that 2 disc set (which could have been put on one CD).
0525423273|5.0|I love this book from the start. The writing style is fantastic and I fell in love with the characters. I was sad when it was over. I could have kept reading for 300 more pages. I look forward to many more books from this author.
0451228375|5.0|Definitely a must read before you die.  The sooner the better too because its long but loved every word!
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this look at events leading to wwI through Follett's captivating characters. Cannot wait to read the next book in the series. Follett has given me a greater appreciation of historical event than I ever got from history classes.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|Would not have bought this if it was clearly shown at the top that it doesn't work outside USA and Canada as it does not play in Australia.
B003H9MSPG|4.0|We bought several Nerf guns, and just had our first family war in the back yard. This gun is reliable, and shoots pretty far. It shoots a few darts, but the CS-35 with circular clip is the best gun as it shoots farther, holds more, and allows for more play time.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy this movie every time I have had the oportunity to see it. There is so much information on these three disc set that I have not watched everything. This movie is truly the evoultion of the next generation of science fiction movies. I am always finding something new that I overlooked after seeing the documentary portions of this set. The special effects and writing is truly an awesome piece of work.
1416914285|4.0|I am anxious to read this book, however since I never recied City of AShes, I now have to wait until I can obtain a copy because this is the 4th book in the series and I have been unable to read the 3rd book.      Thanks  Linda
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I have always liked this movie and it was a pleasure to watch it again.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|We bought several Nerf guns, and just had our first family war in the back yard. This gun is reliable, and has a cool prop if you want to ground shoot. It looks awesome, but can be a little heavy for small kids. It shoots a few darts, but the CS-35 with circular clip is the best gun as it shoots farther, holds more, and allows for more play time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I  choose this book a whim because I needed something to entertain me while I was sick. I had no idea that it was part of a trilogy.  All the characters are well thought out.  This book reminded me of Enders Game on what that type of pressure does to children.  If you enjoyed any of the Enders Game series you will enjoy this book.
0374290024|5.0|I read this book like an installment of the The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I couldn't wait to find out how it turns out - how Morris' theory of evolution applies to the future. Needless to say, I was thoroughly engaged by great writing and one of the most compelling arguments for how we rise and fall, repeatedly. I turned the last page about a month ago and still think about it almost every day. One of the best reads of the last 5 years.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I'm a 17 year old girl and I couldn't put this book down!  It was by far the best one in the series! I loved everything about it, and was disapointed when it ended...I wanted more! When I started reading this series I couldn't stop...I ended up reading all 4 of Mrs. Meyer's books in less then 4 days! And hands down this one was my favorite! Stephenie Meyer: Thank you so much for dreaming up my fantasy world, you're my all time favorite author as well as my hero...I hope you continue writing!
B0027XV1CO|5.0|Luckily I purchased 3 of these and wouldn't part with anything from Barbra. What caught my eye is someone is selling it for over $100.00 when you can still buy these for a lot less. Her singing is spectacular and the show one of her best and by far most relaxed. I'd think twice before buying from the seller for that amount.
B0045EJY90|5.0|Well made component, better than the low price would suggest. Simple, uncluttered design looks nice. Other family members have no problem using it.    The real special feature is the ipod integration, which bypasses the ipod's digital audio converter (DAC) and uses the better quality Burr-Brown DAC built into the unit. I've tested aac and apple lossless files on my ipod and they sound great. You plug in the ipod and it goes through an 'authentication'.. which is apparently how a device can get access to the digital audio stream from the ipod rather than the analog line out. There are other high-end audio products that can do this, but at far higher cost.     To be honest, I don't know if I'm enough of a critical listener to really determine how a better DAC affects the sound, but it's a cool feature anyway. My only criticism is that navigating through MP3 files on a USB thumb drive is fairly clunky and the controls for directory switching are only on the remote.
B002NOYX54|5.0|I really love Playing for a Change songs. This is a great combo that brings both the CD and the DVD. It arrived in the exact time they said it would and in great conditions. I still have mine, I've had them over a year now and I play them non-stop and they keep working. I really recommend it!
B003UYUP58|5.0|A truly fantastic book for anyone interested in learning more about cancer and the medical community's quest for a \\"cure\\".  Highly recommend this book.
0307463745|4.0|I'm not a designer by trade, nor a programmer or entrepreneur.  I work for a large company in a 'good old boys' industry.  From that point of view, this book is a refreshingly simple smack across the face of traditional thats-the-way-we've-always-done-it mentalities.  It's a philosophy, one the authors trust you to apply appropriately to your work.  It's an easy read which is both consistent with their advice and further reason to pickup and enjoy this book.
B00009Y3L4|4.0|Very Theatrical, and music and acting is wonderful.  Subject matter is a bit older that I had wanted, but I have teens and can talk to them.
0061989142|5.0|I have read Lauren Conrad's novels and enjoyed so of course I was curious to see what her Style book was all about since she has her fashion line at Kohl's and always looks amazing on the red carpet and in celebrity magazines.    I thought the information was very practical and great for those that are on a budget and need to know how to create a basic wardrobe using classic pieces that will be a good investment and how you can dress them up/dress down, etc.  I like that Lauren indicates when to stock up on basics (basic color tee-shirts and jeans that fit well) and where not to splurge or go overboard even if it's on sale (fad items, excessive clothing).  I also like how she give ideas on how to accessorize (use of scarves that I would have never thought of ... tying to a purse handle to add color/spark) and how to get rid of deodorant stains on whites, how to temporarily hem jeans/pants, what pieces can be interchanged/packed for various types of trips, how to pose for photos, what types of clothing/jeans flatter certain body parts.    This book is easy to read and I loved the beautiful photos of Lauren and the illustrations, examples.
B00338QENI|5.0|I actually bought this book by accident (hit the wrong button on my Kindle!).  I am glad I did--it's terrific.  If you have any interest in science, American  history, or human behavior, this is a book you must read!  Five Stars
0385342047|1.0|I have read all of Kinsellas books and enjoyed the Shopaholic series but after reading this book, I think Kinsella needs to STOP and END the Shopaholic series ... this book was horrible.  This book was very hard to hold my interest with Becky's two year old brat that destroys everything she gets her hands on, does not listen to her mother, father, grandmother and grandfather and they all think that this child is normal and accepts her misbehavor and out of control personality (not funny and cute).  It was so annoying reading about a bratty, out of control child whose mother is a pathological liar about everything and anything and continues to lie to her husband, mother, father, sister, etc.   Sorry but only one star (and this book did not even deserve that).  I would highly recommend to not spend your time or money attempting to read such garbage.  There are better books out there that are really good and entertaining.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|i think this book is amazing! there is nothing but suprises on every turn. i love it . kindle rocks
B0009UC810|4.0|It's a classic.  Belushi and Aykroyd are great together. It's one of my favorite comedies ever. Have to watch it a couple of times a year. I bought this edition for my 11 yr old grandson, it is one of his favorite movies also.  This movie crosses the age barriers. The music and the cameo apperances by Ray Charles and Arthea Franklin and many more blues singers is the icing on the cake. It a must have.
0743297334|2.0|I picked up the Sun Also Rises as my first introduction to Hemingway.  While I was very excited - I have to say however that I was fairly disappointed with this 200+ page novel. More than once during this novel, I had thoughts of putting it down never to return to it.     The pace of the book, extremely slow and methodical, make it very difficult to get through the whole story. The tone is fairly monotonous for most of the book with the plot unwinding in very ordinary fashion without much intrigue whatsoever.     I found the characters in the book to be a bit annoying - their excessive eating and drinking along with their rather quick, undeveloped dialogue proved difficult to digest.  The characters appeared to avoid  some of the major topics, situations and events that were laid out in the novel in favor of drinking, eating & socializing.     The saving grace of this book is Hemingway's depiction of bull-fighting towards the end.  Even though many pages are not spent in this area, there was well-written, intriguing and even suspenseful prose in those bull-fighting pages.     The main reason I read this book through till the end was to find out how things would develop and end with the character Brett - and her relationship with Jake.     As I mentioned - however - the novel proved to be a disappointment.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|I am actually SHOCKED by some of the low reviews given here.  Admittingly, this movie is not for everyone (particularly the claustrophobic) but it is a remarkable moving and gripping thriller and there is strong talk of an Academy award nomination for Ryan Reynolds which would be well-deserved.  I watched this movie at a matinee in a dark mostly empty theater and it was a fantastic experience that I would recommend to anyone.  Considering the entire movie is filmed in a box and only has one actor, it is remarkably well done and puts you on the edge of your seat from beginning to heart-wrenching end.  I HIGHLY recommend this film and consider it one of the best films of 2010 (and I see approx 400-500 movies a year).
0060775858|5.0|Most children don't just like rituals, they need them.  This book incorporates simple ritual into one of the more difficult and scary things every child must master -- falling asleep.  Seeing the young bunny saying \\"good night\\" to everyday objects and then peacefully falling asleep takes some of the fear out of bedtime.  I think this is one reason why a lot of children want to read this book every single night.<br /><br />While many adults are put off by the \\"ugly\\" illustrations and seemingly boring text, there's a good chance this book will become one of your child's favorites.
B0047SF41G|3.0|Just watched this long weekend.It was okay,it just wasn't great as the other two.<br />Predator one will always be my favorite!
1402210795|3.0|I am a great fan of Georgette Heyer's regency novels, but this one is not a favorite.  The premise for the action, that young and immature Lord Sherringham, rebuffed by the lovely Isabella, is so angry that he vows, and actually does, marry the first woman he sees after his rejection, is a novel and promising one.  The young lady, even younger and more naive than her new husband, is Hero Wantage (a wonderful and symbolic name!), who has been devoted to \\"Sherry\\" all her life--he decides to call her \\"Kitten\\" and treats her indeed as a sort of pet.  The problem is that the social faux pas which cause Hero so much grief go on for far too long.  Unusually for a Heyer novel, Friday's Child seems endless, and the trick becomes a bit tired.<br />The ending seems unconvincing and incomplete, with only a show of maturation on the part of the newlyweds.  (Isabella seems to mature more than Hero!)<br /><br />Bright spots are the hero's humorous friends, with the exception of the lovelorn George, and Heyer's usual expert evocation of Regency England.<br /><br />Try Frederica instead!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A refreshing change from all those vampire books! Even better than Twilight. With such strong characters and the unique setting makes this book a distict selection for avid readers of all ages (I suggest 5th grade and up)  this book makes me smile, laugh out loud, cry, grit my teeth, and slam my kindle shut only to open it back up again for more! enjoy asap!
B004B7PX2S|4.0|The best thing that can be said about this film is that it feels extremely real.  Every opportunity to make Clooney into a Bond, Bourne, Potter, Iron Man -- etcetera -- was rejected.  If you need shiny keys shaking before your eyes to keep you awake, THE AMERICAN is like drinking a gallon of Nyquil after being in the NYC marathon.    The worst thing that can be said about this movie is that it may be too minimal.  I'm all about less is more, but one must also make sure you have more than enough in the film to achieve that perfect level of 'less'.    That said, it's striking this movie only had one scene which needed to be cut, the short Sergio Leone fanboy scene.  If the filmmaker has to tell me his film is slow and calculated like the genius Leone -- it's the cinematic equivalent of 'blinking'.  Did Leone need to do this?  Nope.  And neither does THE AMERICAN.    If you thought INCEPTION was way too much and left you feeling empty, THE AMERICAN may be too little but leaves you feeling nearly full.
1597801577|5.0|There are plenty of good plot summaries here and I won't write another.    Reading the reviews, I was worried that the dystopian book would be more of a downer than I was up for, but I got crazy and went for it anyway.     The world is dystopian with billions dead, most edible plants wiped out and so on. Not so great. On the other hand, we have heroic figures and elements of hope which the book turns to in the end. Not a total downer after-all. I was also worried that there might be more horror than I am up for. I am a sci-fi-fantasy-adventure guy. Horror isn't my thing. I can report that while there was icky stuff, there was nothing I'd call horror.    Well written. Page turner. Really interesting ideas, great characters, and very little suspension of disbelief required. A winner for me. I'm waiting for Bacigalupi to write another novel (aside from \\"windup girl\\", only short stories and a young adult novel so far).    Cheers
B002ZG99CM|2.0|Quick niggle.......why is this called The Karate Kid, there is no Karate in it. This should have been called The Kung Fu Kid. Instead the title makes no sense except for the fact that this is a complete rip of the original without the depth that made the original a classic. I can see this being an awesome movie for the young ones with the protagonist being 12, but for those that grew up watching the original, this is a huge disappointment.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have a 4G in an otterbox. this was necessary after my toddler broke my 3G that was in a speck case. The otterbox would not fit my ihome charger/clock radio thing or the charger at the gym on the treadmill. So, I was always taking the otterbox off to charge it, or just using the usb wall/pc charger.<br /><br />I knew there had to be a better way and this is it.  Otterbox should sell these too since they created the need for them. Now I can connect my encased iphone in any charger.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|This series is easy to get hooked on.  You can really identify with the characters and the way-out happenings and their solution.  I just ordered year 2 I liked it so much!
B0000844I8|4.0|Having seen much of the TV series first, I was a little disappointed with the difference of characters, and that the movie's story of how the gate was found doesn't match the pilot episode. But it's a good movie taken as is, and gives a good overview of the concept.
B002ZG981E|5.0|this movie is proof that film making is not dead. A deep and engaging story, spectacular special effects, enthralling score, witty dialogue, and top-notch acting and directing, this movie has it all! Christopher Nolan never fails to dissatisfy and is one of the greatest film makers of our time. The way he skillfully fills his movies with action and special effects without making plot and acting take a back seat. You will not find a single thing half-assed in this movie. He truly went all out and boy did it payed off! Inception is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus that is masterfully crafted in such a way that you will want to see again and again
B001EAWMFQ|3.0|English dubbing any Asian film IMO is always a distraction, and in \\"Shogun Assassin\\" Wakayama Tomisaburo's commanding growl being incompatibly replaced detracts from his character's presence.    Further, I agree with others that condensing the first two original episodes into one damages the original plot line and initial character development.    This monumental classic IMO is best enjoyed as the original 6 episode \\"Lone Wolf and Cub\\" series also US released thru Animeigo which I would rate 5 stars for technical quality and accurate English translation subtitles.    However, I do commend Animeigo for making this dubbed version available for those that prefer not to deal with translation subs.
0307577589|4.0|What makes the novel work for this reader is the title character, 24 yr old Lisbeth Salander. She's pierced, tattooed, dismissive and brilliant, with a photographic memory and a talent for computer hacking. She gets an assignment to find all the facts on forty-something Mikael Blomquist a magazine journalist. Their paths meet later in the book as they try to solve a murder crime. The quirky chemistry between this odd couple makes for good drama and sparks this enjoyable mystery.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading parts two and three of this trilogy.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I loved the way the author used appropriate language and emotions to convey the main character in this book.  It was a wonderful read.
B0048LPRCS|1.0|Dull.     On the positive side I think the sound for the film is well done. The viewing audience sees from the perspective of the main character (as in \\"On Being John Malkevich\\", but not to be compared). Too bad the film is not worth sitting through.    The DMT animation sequence at the beginning of the film is nice (I suggest watching that and leaving promptly afterwards). I thought \\"Now THIS is great....\\" but unfortunately it went swiftly downhill after that. He should have kept on with DMT, but noooooo.....    The characters are completely flat, the movie is WAY too long. The viewing audience is made voyeur to the lives of these hopeless & flat characters w NOTHING going on. It's simply impossible to feel anything towards any one of the characters as they are all so unbelievable. My guess is it won't work as erotica/porn either as it is tortuously long, slow, boring. Maybe some people will get off on the sex (most of it's  at the end, guys) as the sex is free of any of the clumsy details of actual human relationships. just desperate, bored and clueless.     What makes \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" a great movie, makes \\"Enter the Void\\" a bad one.  \\"Enter the Void\\", tries to shock and titillate (emphasis on tit), without having to deal with any social context, history, or anything at all that we can relate to (outside of drug dealing, violence, prostitution and police). Now throw in the Tibetan Book of the Dead...?      Extremely lengthy low-tech  visual special effects, one of the animation/effects is so bad that you can actually see the model/s they are using.    I don't understand how this movie gets produced and marketed, particularly at this length.
0399156577|5.0|Nora Roberts has done it again! Bought this for a friend who has a new puppy; even though they are going to obedience school, I think this book references excellent training techniques! And of course no one brings romance to the forefront in the style of Nora Roberts.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|The director's first film was an academy award winning, deep tense emotionally fraught political drama.  Maybe critics were upset when the director changed tacks this time around and decided to make a more accessible entertainment, in the Hitchcockian vein. Regardless of the bad reviews critics gave this movie, I think the director succeeds admirably at his objective.  I was entertained throughout, Depp and Jolie are solid, and the cinematography is spellbinding.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|amazing end to the story. from the begining she shows character and decite all the way from the first to last page.great way to end an amazing series. best series i have ever read.
B003062NG0|5.0|How most of these songs did not end up on a previous release is surprising, given the strength of the compositions. If you're a fan of Porcupine Tree, this cd is a must have! If you're not familiar with them, I would highly recommend you give it a listen. While some earlier PT/SW recordings have been experimental, ambient, drone, this is great progressive rock more reminiscent of In Absentia & Lightbulb Sun.
B003UESJHO|3.0|There is a very high rating of this film on internet movie database. I actually went to the theater to watch it and I don't think it deserves anything more than a 6/10. Wahlberg is OK, Amy Adams' character was quite despicable for some reason (maybe some sort of intelligent formula) and Christian Bale was the saving grace of the film.<br /><br />Very ordinarily narrated and the direction left me gasping out of despair at certain times, maybe it's the bad luck Wahlberg brings to any film featuring him.<br /><br />There were maybe 2 good scenes in the whole film.<br /><br />I could have lived my life without watching this film but I can't say that about some of the better films this year (Black Swan, T.S.N, Buried and The Town)<br /><br />Please watch the film before buying the DVD, it's over-rated in my view.
1439110123|5.0|I highly recommend this book to all. An account of how the last hundred years has been the age of oil and energy. Politics has been influenced almost entirely by the pursuit of stable energy sources. Read Read Read.
1400079144|5.0|started slow but had me hooked in minutes.   I never even thought who the bad guy really was.  Great book that I will have to read again to truly understand it all.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|This review contains a spoiler. Do not read this review if you do not want to read the spoiler.    Firstly, I misunderstood the film advertisement and initially mistook this film to be an action/adventure thriller.  So there was an initial disappointment, but I got over it and for the most part was moderately entertained by the tragic romance & drama involving the burnt out hitman/arms customizer (George Clooney) who longs for comfort through friendship & romance which is forbidden in his line of work.     What nearly ruined this film for me was the unnecessarily elaborate climatic scene where the the female assassin who is contracted to kill Clooney's character is mortally wounded by her employer (Clooney's handler) when the handler decides he's going to kill Clooney's character himself.  Why?  Why hire an assassin in the first place, if you are going to try to do the job yourself? It seems to me, that practicality would dictate allowing the assassin to do her job. The ending is inexplicable and overly elaborate just so the film can portray the handler's treachery and to have a poignant and sad ending where \\"the American\\" can meet his lover one last time before he dies at their secret meeting place.     It could have been a better movie, if the storyline provided a more logical execution of the ending, but as is, I have to give it a \\"3\\".

1416955070|3.0|Okay, this one was a bit weird for me. I can't say that I didn't like it, but I didn't love it either. I did however like certain aspects of this 1st book of this series. I liked the way this world was vividly described, the building of the world was not slow or dragged out which is a huge plus. The descriptions is what will grab you and keep ur interest. I did like Jace and Clary. I liked all the characters in this one actually. Even Alaric who was 2nd in command to Luke. Although there wasn't much said about him, his presence was one you felt. I was intrigued by him. Jace of course will grab you, his whole essence is just.. You can't not like this young man or grow to care about what happens to him in this world. I like Simon too (Clary's BFF).<br /><br />Now on to some of the things I did not like. I did not like that it took forever for the plot to get under way. Like usually it's the building of a world that alot of the time will drag the story. But that was not true in this case. Here the \\"story\\" is what dragged the story. It took forever for you to see why these things were essentially happening in the first place. Why Clary is suddenly thrown into a world she never knew existed. That's what kinda got on my nerves. Then the way things played out with her and Jace, I was very disappointed with. I'm hoping the next 2 books will just get better and that things play out better. But I would recommend this read. It was heart felt, rich with color emotion, and suspense. And it was a bit funny too.
B0036EH3TS|4.0|Couldn't tell you how long it's been since I first watched Armageddon however I have always found it to be entertaining.  The mix of characters is quite comical.  I recently bought the Blu-ray version so that I could see the action sequences on a big-screen with best detail and this disc met all my expectations.  The original meteor shower hitting New York city was really something.  If you like action movies and enjoy Willis and Affleck you can't go wrong with this one.  Highly recommended.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|In between missions or before bed I like to pop an episode in of Firefly here in Afghanistan. I've seen it 100 times but still I miss lines and see new things in the background. I don't know were Joss Whedon came up with some of the lines but they are hilarious and very rememorable.    Great show and worth 5 stars no doubt. I don't use the Blu Ray stuff but looks great in HD.    If you haven't seen this yet and can pick up the season for 20 bucks or less like I did you'll get your money's worth.     You know what else is funny is this is one of the few Sci-Fi shows I can get my wife to watch.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|And I mean that as a compliment. This is hugely listenable -- catchy the first run through, grows on you even more after. Proof you don't need a great movie for a great soundtrack. Perfect for headphones at the gym. Most addictive soundtrack I've heard since Slumdog Millionaire.
B001E75QH0|5.0|My entire family enjoys watching the Indiana series.  I also bought this for my mother for a birthday gift and she loves it too. Great for a popcorn, movie night.  Clean entertainment for the whole family
1440503257|4.0|I thought the recipes in here would be a little more kid friendly both in wanting to eat them and helping make them, and there are not many that meet both of those criteria, if you're kid is a die hard harry potter fan and likes to eat adventurously this is good.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|Talk about a disappointment. We have been dying to watch this movie since it came out. We finally got it for Christmas and stopped 30 min into it. The movie itself for quality was great, but there is a voodoo doctor in there that uses very dark and demonic magic to conjure up spirits and demons from the other side. In return for the power he promises to deliver lost souls to the ones he calls his 'friends on the other side'.  It definitely is not for children and I really don't feel for adults either since he's blatantly using satanic dark magic.  It never mentions this on the case and we sure wouldn't have bought it. I think Disney went way to far on this. Will not recommend this to anyone.
B004B8DH98|1.0|We gave this movie a chance...it made no sense, it was so boring . Totally stupid.  This must have been a \\"pet project of Clooney\\". Pass the Pepto Bismol...
B001B71NOI|5.0|All audio on the audio cd can be found for a free (band supported and sponsored) download on Nine Inch Nails' website:  [...]    This product is for the dedicated NIN fanbase. It does not disappoint.  This physical verison of \\"The Slip\\" brings back meaning for \\"Limited Edition.\\" The term has become somewhat of a marketing gimmick as many companies label their products as \\"limited\\" and yet they remain in production years later. I was very pleased to find a unique xxx,xxx / 250,000 printed on the back of the of casing.    Inside you'll find the complete slip audio cd, 3 random artwork stickers for tracks off the album, a artwork/lyrics booklet, and a rehearsal DVD featuring 5 tracks; 1,000,000, Letting You, Discipline, Echoplex, and Head Down. The rehearsal DVD is my favorite part of this product as I prefer to listen to Robin Finck play lead guitar on all of these songs live over the album versions (especially Head Down.) I look forward to extracting the audio from the live recordings.    This product is a must own for anyone who openly refers to themselves as a Nine Inch Nails fan.    If you haven't heard the album, I suggest you download it for free (above) before purchasing this and possibly lowering it's product rating with unnecessary ignorance.
B000059T1V|5.0|For that elusive hard to find CD this site is definitely the place to go and compared to the High Steet Store Prices you get a much better deal.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|I bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. She likes Iron Man and Transformers. Go figure. Anyway, the Blu-ray looks and sounds very good played from a PS3 to a 50\\" plasma. It's nice that it include DVD so we can watch it on our laptop computer. Minus two stars because it has previews on it. I tolerate previews on rentals, but I pay to own it specifically to watch it without distraction. All the other discs I've purchased recently don't have previews. So what gives?
B0015DYIH2|5.0|OMG. how can u not love the twlight series. edward is such a nice and protective vampire. i absoulutley adore alice. the movies also rox!!!!
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Great story line, I liked it much better than most movies.     You can tell the toys are holding back the animators detail. The whole environment of the movie is near life-like until you see a toy or person. Otherwise, it's awesome.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Since HDMI is a digital interface, cables either do or do not work.  So I'm not going to discuss performance here, but rather focus on packaging and build.    The packaging was very impressive.  The cable comes in a very simple box, and the ends are capped with plastic covers over the gold plated connectors.  The glossy plastic surfaces with the Amazon logo are covered with plastic film which you can peel off, so that was pretty nice.  I found those impressive since nice packaging tends to please me quite a bit.    The other notable thing is the jacket.  It's your standard plastic/rubber wire jacket, and seems sturdy enough.  But it is also fairly flexible, unlike the jacket on my other HDMI cable.  If you need to put this cable through a trench or duct of some kind (my entertainment stand has these built in), you will find it a lot easier with this cable due to the flexibility of the jacket.  It was also easier to route into the trench because the jacket was thinner too, so that was nice.    Also, the connectors are a lot shorter than other HDMI cables that I have seen, which is very nice if your TV is flat to the wall and you don't want the cable off of the connector being crushed because there isn't enough space.  This also makes removing and inserting the cable easier because the smaller connector gives you more room to maneuver.    FInally, the 3ft. cable that I bought was actually cheaper than the 6ft. cable that I bought previously.  I wish these had been around when I purchased the other one.    Good value, and the definitely work.
B003J27WFW|5.0|\\"Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage\\" is an interesting, entertaining 2-DVD set that offers a chronology of one of the most influential progressive rock bands ever and certainly, the most famous as a 3-piece act. The first includes the history of the band from the Lifeson/Lee high school days to present and the second, a video scrapbook of clips, some rare and some available on other Rush DVD sets.<br /><br />The first DVD is a little more than an hour in length and although the material is priceless, I was a little disappointed as a longtime Rush fan that it was not longer. There is definitely enough to mention with the band's 40-plus years to cover at least 2 hours, if not more. Certain important periods of the band's history, e.g. A Farewell to Kings (after 2112) were grouped in a period representing the introduction of the use of synthesizers in the band's music. It would have been nice to have certain barely-mentioned albums given a little more commentary. Even so, this DVD is definitely worth its weight, with comments offered by various other musicians, the likes of Sebastian Bach, Gene Simmons, Jack Black, Les Claypool and others.<br /><br />Through the camera lens, we see the formation of the Lifeson/Lee bond in the high school years and the early version of Rush with John Rutsey. After the first album, Rush decides that Rutsey's health is too questionable for him to endure the rigors of constant touring. Shortly after, the Neil Peart audition happens and the new version of Rush forms with Lee and Lifeson more convinced by Neil's phenomenal drumming and intellect than his outward appearance. The new Rush is born and the progressive rock world is about to change forever. Some rare footage of these early periods is offered and the video quality is excellent.<br /><br />From that point, we see that the Lee/Lifeson/Peart trio endures some tough early years with pressure from the record label to conform and the band resisting, marching to \\"its own beat\\". These were very difficult times for Rush and nearly resulted in its own dissolving. The breakthrough was \\"2112\\", which to the label's surprise, gained quite a cult following. At that juncture, Rush was then able to dictate back to the label just what it would play, as well as how it would write/arrange its music.<br /><br />Later scenes progress through Rush's success in every significant period: Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace Under Pressure, etc. through the desire to minimize or eliminate the use of keyboards (Test for Echo), the unimaginable tragedy of Peart and the triumphant return of Rush.<br /><br />One of the most significant features throughout the DVD is Neil Peart joking and smiling in front of the camera. This is a major juxtaposition of his expressions offered while onstage and reveals the side of him that fans really want to see. Of course, the life of fame, coupled with highly intrusive fans and personal tragedy have changed him. I just watched the Grace Under Pressure DVD (1984)(Rush Replay X3) and he was a totally different guy, very relaxed in front of the camera and not uptight at all. He might be humble and private in nature, but he should accept that he is widely considered to be one of the most (if not THE MOST) accomplished drummers in the history of modern music. Not only that, but the drummer/lyricist-turned-social and environmental psychologist has authored the lyrics to some of the most phenomenally important songs in the last 30 years of rock:  The Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Subdivisions, Distant Early Warning, The Big Money, etc....<br /><br />Through both of the DVDs, one can see the personal chemistry that has made Rush successful throughout their history: it happens offstage as well as on. An intimate bond of friendship between highly-talented musicians doesn't happen often and it's no wonder that Rush is so highly regarded by their fellow musicians. Their individual abilities transcend into superstardom, whose fans have long since inducted them into their own Rock 'N Roll Hall Of Fame.<br /><br />This DVD set is definitely for old Rush fans, but also new ones just coming onto the scene who want to learn about the extraordinary musicianship of perhaps the greatest \\"cult\\" band of all time.Hall Of Fame.    This DVD set is definitely for old Rush fans, but also new ones just coming onto the scene who want to learn about the extraordinary musicianship of perhaps the greatest \\"cult\\" band of all time.
B002ZG981E|4.0|This is a great movie with phenominal special affects. However, I was hoping for a 'making of' documentary on the second DVD, but there isn't one. There's a documentary about dreams, a cartoon story, and still shots, but that's about it.
B00015BJ0E|1.0|I bought this CD based on customer reviews and after auditioning the free audio samples on Amazon.  When I received the product, the CD inside was different from what was described on the website.  The actual CD was entitled \\"Los Piratas\\".  I returned the product thinking that it was just a mistake on Amazon's part.  When I received the replacement shipment, I got the same wrong CD.  I filed for a refund request which Amazon promptly processed.  I have purchased numerous items from Amazon over many many years and this is the first time this has ever happened.  I recommend that Amazon management adopt and implement stricter quality control procedures for its merchandise.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well conceived and well written, this trilogy about post-apocalyptic America is fast-reading and compelling. I recommend all three books to any reader over the age of 13, and as others have noted, they're especially good because they feature a strong female protagonist.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I ordered this cable to accompany the Apple TV I ordered my husband for Christmas.  It was necessary, otherwise it was like receiving a toy without the batteries, what a bummer.  So he was excited to know that I thought the gift through and also got him the cable.  It works great and was a great price.
B003BKF696|1.0|This disc has some interesting drums but the music itself is stiff and void of any emotion.  Indeed, a kind of numb feeling seems to be the heart of this music.  What makes it unlistenable is lyrics such as \\"I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees, I never married but Ohio don't remember me\\".  It has no meaning, no poetic quality, and is not clever nonsense.  It is just dumb and no pleasure to listen to.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I find the blu ray copies of these movies excellant. I have owned them in every form and blu ray is the best. This format makes these movies what they were meant to be.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The description of the item was very helpful and set at an excellent price. The details of the product described it perfectly and reached my expectations. I would recommend that others purchase it. Amazon is a trustworthy and helpful website.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The third book in one of the best modern day thrillers I have read.  From the never ending fast pace, to the gory details, and finally the unlikely heroin.  Overall, a fantastic read.  It is unfortunate that we won't be reading more from this author!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|It is a shame John Cleese did so few episodes of Fawlty Towers.  They are hilarious and clever.  I bought these for my daughter after she saw an episode on vacation.  We watched all of them within a few days and even went back and watched a few over.  If you like British comedies then you should love these!
B001HBX8NC|5.0|This is the very best version of Rigoletto currently available ( In blu ray).LEO NUCCI who has performed as Rigoletto before, is  is at his very best,and is well supported by both the other cast and by photography in blu ray,and the orchestra. The new GILDA is also a delight and you can not go wrong with this version of RIGOLETTO!
B002JWD6AS|2.0|This books setting, characters, and premise had great potential. Werewolf and supernatural story are really popular and exciting in todays society. This book was everything it promised to be. It was full of mystery, romance, supernatural, and conflict.    However it is EXACTLY the same as the Twilight saga but with wolves. The same obsessive love at first sight, same lust after only dating a short time span, and same fear of the losing that love due to the boys immortality/supernatural issue.     I just feel like this book had soooo much promise to be on a different path from Stephanie Myers books. I LOVE these types of book but if you are going to write them you HAVE to do something no one has done yet. Or else it seems like your just riding coat tails.
B003Y3ZTGA|1.0|Are you people insane? Look I understand music is subjective and what is good and bad is defined by the listener, but COME ON!!! This album is garbage no matter how you look at it. I mean, where to begin? The stupid, hedonistic, purposely trashy lyrics? (Its one thing to have adult themes in your music, but this is one step away from prostitution). The flat, dull, boring music (any moron with a keyboard and pro tools can make a catchy beat, thats no reason for a five star review)? Her obvious lack of singing chops? Give me a break. Boring, unintelligent dribble designed for stupid people, mostly women, to shake their asses to while drunk.
1402756399|5.0|Not to take one iota of the importance of Darwin's original edition, the addition of pictures and reproductions of bits of letters, journals, and other books merits its own accolades. The book is beautiful, and since \\"Origin\\" is in its original form it is even more interesting. My one complaint with the text is minor: the editor refers to Stephen Jay Gould as an ornithologist which is akin to saying that Charles Darwin was an observer of animals.     Even if you have several copies of \\"Origin\\" it is worthwhile to add this book to your collection. Some reviewers do not like that the pictures do not match with the text but (to me) their inclusion in a first edition reproduction is simply luscious. To get a closer view of this society-altering point of history is a gift.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|I found the movie to be interesting enough, following Ree's quest to find out what happened to her father and the people she meets along the way.  It was certainly atmospheric and the acting, from the lead characters at least, was affective. The music was also very good. However, I did find the movie to be somewhat of a stereotype of poor mountain southerners, with the brutal men, often beaten down women, meth labs instead of moonshine and implications of a hopelessly closed inbred society. Certainly there are people like this, but did we need so many in one movie? I also found some holes in the plots involving the characters changing relationships with each other, which aren't always explained or make sense. The movie is worth seeing but I don't think it deserves all the hype it has received.
B003J27WFW|5.0|A must for any die hard Rush fan, if you are just getting into them, or want to get into them and want to know the history. This documentary is very well made. It buzzes along real nicely and does not slow down at all.   I guess there is so much to say that even if this documentary was double the length, it would still leave you wanting more.     I bought this on Blue Ray when it first came out by mistake, since I don't own a blue ray player. I was able to watch it on my sons Playstation, but he took that back to his room. I am buying the DVD version so I can watch it whenever.
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|I won't repeat what others have said except to say the following:    Performers get an A+ without hesitation.  Kaufmann's \\"Pourquoi me réveiller\\" is breathtaking.  Production is spare but gets a B because it works.  Videography is an F, a capital F for all the reasons others have said.    But the performance is so magnificent it's a must have and deserves 5 stars!
B003U0AHBO|4.0|I never saw this in theaters due to the mediocre reviews but I was glad I finally saw this movie.     Having somehow never seen a preview of this movie, I viewed this film fresh and found it to be quite entertaining, with good action, an enjoyable and mostly solid story line, and good acting - leave it to Ridley Scott to come up with another film from him that rivals \\"Gladitor\\". I went directly to the Directors Cut and found that version to be well made without the storytelling hiccups the theatrical version seemed to have from the other reviews.    Some minor critisms about this movie were that the third act seemed to be a little rushed and the movie came across a little more serious than it is perhaps intended to be. However, the film was otherwise nice to watch.  Therefore, I recommend this film, especially the Dirctor's Cut for a fuller experience.
B001NFU5WE|4.0|The movie itself is fantastic and the quality of the Blu-Ray is just amazing, but you may want to pass up this limited edition set. The bonus features and the featurette are nice, but the other little bonuses could easily go unmissed and the case itself doesn't fit in very well with my collection of movies. I actually keep the mask case inside the box it came in because the actual case is just so unorthodox. I can't recommend picking up this limited edition, just be prepared if you do pick it up!
0385333846|4.0|It's hard to say much about something one understands so little. Such is the case for me with Slaughterhouse-Five, a relatively short, oft confusing anti-war story inspired by Vonnegut's experiences during WWII, specifically, US and Britain's bombing of Dresden in February of 1945. Vonnegut's sources (p 188) place the death toll at 135,000, while more recent data (this from Wikipedia which cites a 2008 study) set it nearer to 25,000, a still staggering sum. The author begins Chapter One with, \\"All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true,\\" and explains how he came to write the story and choose The Children's Crusade as its subtitle. \\"So it goes.\\"<br /><br />In spite of the (five!) pages of notes I took to help keep track of what was going on, I was in an almost constant state of confusion while reading it. Only afterwards, by reading through my notes and several other sources, was I able to make sense of things. It follows a completely unprepared, militarily clueless, time-traveling chaplain's assistant named Billy Pilgrim before, during, and after WWII. He interacts with fellow soldiers (I found the war parts the most interesting), an alien race called the Tralfamadorians, and his wife and children. Pilgrim's talk of the alien race is a primary cause for concern for nonbelievers. \\"And so on.\\"<br /><br />In spite of the many time traveling tangents and strange happenings, I liked the story for several reasons: I now understand the book's title, it's a challenging read; it depicts war, as expected, in all its horribleness; and it's like no other war story I've read before. Slaughterhouse-Five is a uniquely good look at the badness war. Also good: The Things They Carried by Timothy O'Brien, Operation Homecoming: Iran, Afghanistan, and the Home Front, in the Words of U.S. Troops and Their Families edited by Andrew Carroll, and Zinky Boys by Svetlana Alexievich.
0061150142|5.0|You will not want to put down this book and the twist at the end will pull on your heartstrings!  Another prize read by Jodi Piccoult :-)
1849392129|5.0|My two bookworms (nine and eleven years old)and I listened to the audio version of this story a few months ago, and loved the way the tale turns out. The book is primarily about what goes along with being a pre-teen, like: friendship, family, dealing with conflict and being forced into thinking outside the box, things the main character, a 12-year-old girl named Miranda, shares her experiences about as she narrates the story.<br /><br />As the novel, set in the late seventies, begins, readers learn that Miranda's mother is scheduled to be a contestant on The $20,000 Pyramid (which explains the format of the chapter titles). Miranda, her mother's longtime friend from their apartment complex, Louisa, and her mother's boyfriend of two years, Richard, work together to prepare her for the big day. The pre-teen, a science fiction buff, has to work through stuff typical to kids of that age: confusion surrounding friends, trying to make good choices, and worries about girlfriends and boyfriends. She also must figure out an enigma.<br /><br />To say much about the mystery is to risk ruining the best of the book (which for you readers able to \\"just go with it\\" when the ultra-logical side of your brain threatens to cry foul), is its unraveling. Remember, (p 188) \\"Common sense is just a name for the way we're used to thinking.\\" When You Reach Me, a tough-to-figure-out tale, is a unique, family friendly story with-an excellent denouement. Cynthia Holloway's performance as the voice of Miranda is really good, but her range of voices didn't enthrall me enough to recommend experiencing the audio version over the visual (reading it yourself, which I did today). Also good: First Light by Rebecca Stead, The Wednesday Wars by Gary Schmidt and To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.
B003O86FMW|5.0|In Catching Fire we see a continued fustration for Katniss about what to do with the two men in her life, Peeta and Gale. Plus the capitol has an idea of what appropriate behavior is toward their government, and Katniss is their new enemy after the 'berry incident.' With the Quarter Quell of the Hunger games coming up, Katniss and Peeta are facing their job has mentors to the new tributes...but little do they know that another role might be in store for them.<br /><br />I mean really, what can I say that hasn't already been said about how great this series is. I'm just...speechless. The idea of these masterpieces just contain the reader like no other. I mean think about it, the future is completely unknown to us, and thats why I love books like Catching Fire. Our future could very well end up like the one in the Hunger games, and thats a scary thought.<br /><br />Details:<br />+ Does not stand alone, you should definately read 'The Hunger Games' before Catching fire if you truely want to understand the plot and characters.<br />+ Rated by me: PG-14. Contains gory violence but no worse than what kids see in video games. No curse words or sex.<br />+ Other books you might also like: Uglies series, Fahrenheit 451, The Time Machine, and Brave New World.<br /><br />Happy Reading =)
B002JVWRAO|5.0|My favourite TV show all the way back since its highly entertaining debut. A great mix of horror and, yes, even bits of comedy. Castiel holds his own, and the Winchester brothers are great as always. Highly recommended.
B0047S1KMS|4.0|My only complaint is the fact that in the main menu , when you click on \\"play all\\" , it's just the first episode . You need to click on episodes and features to get to the rest of the series.
B001QB5SHM|5.0|A funny story about a dysfunctional family that put aside their troubles to give Olive a chance at the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" title. Olive is a little girl about 9 years old who is positive about winning this title, even though her chances are slim.  The family bands together to overcome their own problems and help her.  It is a very rewarding and funny story.
6304806418|4.0|Never having been a fan of Madonna, I was pleasantly surprised to see how well she depicted Eva Peron in the screen version of the Andrew Lloyd-Webber musical \\"Evita.\\"  Her performance was equaled by Antonio Banderas as \\"Che,\\" and by Jonathon Pryce as Juan Peron. The lyrics are clever, comical and evocative, and the music engages the viewer from start to finish.  I dare anyone to watch this movie and not catch him/herself singing the lyrics to at least one of the compositions, which flow seamlessly throughout in detailing the tragic story of Eva Peron.
0743496736|5.0|Jodi Picoult is a master of her craft. This Novel left me breathless. She paints a picture so vivid, so heart wrenching and filled with every emotion possible that it's hard to believe that it's fiction. Every detail of the act itself leaves you chilled to the bone, While every incident that had provoked that act breaks your heart. You find yourself caught in a tug of war between  right and wrong.  This is a page turner, with a surprising ending. A book that will be on your mind days after you read it. And also a book that I think everyone should read.
044656740X|5.0|This book is a best seller for a reason. The topic is one that everyone has a vested interest in. It causes introspection and presents a prospective of how changes in view point can lead to different possible ways of doing things. While not a motivational book per-say it does make this reader want to do a few things differently. It is well worth having in your library or that little corner shelf next to your reading chair or, as I would rather have it for space savings, on those reading tablet doo-dads that so many companies are making available.  ;)

0060930349|5.0|I've now read this and Schweikart's Patriot's History of the US.  It was inevitable as I read that I would compare the two. They are in many ways very similar.  I enjoyed Schweikart and felt it was very easy to read.  At the beginning I struggled with Johnson.  I was reading 50 - 100 pages at a clip in Schweikart where at the beginning of Johnson I was struggling to get through 20 at a time.  I'm not sure why that was... but as I got further into the book it got easier.  It's 976 pages, so it's a fairly long book, but having finished it I am glad I read it.  It is different than Patriot's History, but I don't see that as a good thing or a bad thing.  As a side note, I found it interesting that Paul Johnson (author) is British.  I found it interesting to see an Englishman's thoughts on our progress and that he seemed positive about a great deal of the things we have done, even things that were counter to England's interests.  On the whole a good book, well worth my efforts in reading.  Hope you enjoy as well.
B000I0QM0E|5.0|Hard to deny a film with Tim Burton because if you love his work, you love the casts he employs. Usually pulls in old favorites with a few new ones to freshen it up. This is a classic Tim Burton film.
1579128149|5.0|I'm NOT at all a fan of chemistry, and thus would never have read a book like this, but my boyfriend is, so I got this for him as a gift... it's absolutely fascinating!  The pictures are lovely, and the information is both useful and intriguing.  Highly recommended!
0316789798|5.0|I was having trouble getting my kindergartner to draw a picture for his weekly journal page.  This book got him to be more enthusiastic and patient about drawing.  Now his journal page is no longer a weekly battle we both dread.
B000063DFQ|5.0|This album came out when I was 2 years old and it wasn't until I turned 29 that I became an Iron Maiden fan.  Flight of Icarus, The Trooper, Sun and Steel, and To Tame A Land are the best tracks on the album but NO FILLER exists on Piece of Mind.  I can't believe Frank Herbert would not let Steve Harris use a quote from Dune.  Anyone who has read Dune or seen the movie (which came three full years after this album) will know what I am talking about.  Kick-ass album!
B0046UGSNS|4.0|I laughed out loud throughout the movie, it has some really great lines.  The acting is incredible, even though Annette Bening seems to be channeling the stereotypical lesbian archetype too much, and it was hard not to feel like her family would be better off without her.    The only downside is that the ending is not strong enough, but I guess the point is that it is supposed to be this slice of life type movie, that's not meant to tie up all of the loose ends.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|Still trying to absorb it all after getting it for a Christmas gift a week ago!  I've long been frustrated that Bruce hasn't remastered his catalog, since his CDs from the 70s and 80s all sound very thin.  Remastering can be a sales gimmick, but in the case of \\"Born to Run\\" and now \\"Darkness\\", there is a drastic improvement in the sound quality of the remastered versions.  I'm no audiophile, so I don't know or care about the technical aspects, but the sound on this new release is brighter, crisper and clearer than the first CD pressing.  That alone would make this set worthwhile.    But then there's \\"The Promise\\", the double CD of outtakes and alternate versions from the Darkness sessions.  I wasn't familiar with most of these songs, since I don't listen to bootlegs of studio material, so for me it was essentially a new album.  While nothing on here would have been a better choice than what appeared on the actual album, it absolutely stands on its own as a transition between \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Darkness\\".  Many of the songs have the optimism and big sound of \\"Born to Run\\", but also move towards the bleaker and harsher tone that would set the mood of \\"Darkness\\".  Standout tracks for me were \\"Someday (We'll Be Together)\\" with it gorgeous backing vocals, \\"Come On (Let's Go Tonight)\\" set to the haunting melody of \\"Factory\\" (love that brief piano solo before the last verse), and \\"Save My Love\\", a newly recorded piano-heavy song that would translate well live.  The studio version of \\"Fire\\" is interesting with sax and guitar solos that really flesh out the song.      The overdubs and newly recorded vocals don't bother me, although you can absolutely tell the difference between Bruce's voice from the 70s and 2010.  I can understand how some fans would feel that this makes the album less legitimate as a collection of Darkness-era outtakes, but I personally prefer finished versions to demos.  Also, I don't hear any of the compressed sound or overproduction that have marred some of Bruce's recent albums like \\"Magic\\".  Hope he keeps that in mind for future new albums...    As great as the remastered original CD and \\"The Promise\\" are, though, my absolute favorite part of this box-set is the rerecording of the \\"Darkness\\" songs from 2009.  It's a bit disconcerting to hear a live performance with no audience reaction, but I appreciate that Bruce is trying to perform these songs with the passion and spirit that he may have felt was lacking on the original recording.  Gone are the sloppy, twangy vocals that marred some of these songs on the Reunion and Rising tours, or the false endings that he still uses on songs like \\"Badlands\\".  These are fairly faithful renditions but with powerfully energetic singing and playing that show that these songs still mean something to Bruce and the band 30+ years later.  My only complaint is that this set isn't included on CD, so you'll have to rip the audio if you want to listen to it in your car or on an ipod.  It's good enough that I'd gladly pay for a CD version if it was ever released.    The Houston concert is good, although the quality pales in comparison to the Hammersmith show that was its equivalent on the \\"Born to Run\\" remastered set.  I'd rather have had a professionally mastered version of the heavily bootlegged Winterland show from that same time period.  Not only do the recordings from that broadcazst have slightly better sound quality, but the concert itself seems a bit more energetic and inspired.      Regardless of these minor complaints, this is an absolute treasure chest of material for any Springsteen fan.  It's pricey but not overpriced considering what you get.  The notebook-style liner notes sounded cheesey but is actually a fascinating supplement to the music (assuming you can read Bruce's late-70s handwriting!).  Let's hope we don't have to wait for similar rereleases of all the rest of Bruce's 70s and 80s catalog!
B0019X3YXM|2.0|This Hollywood version of My Sassy Girl is just awful: the casting, acting, directing, editing, and plot. The American plotline should have been more adapted toward something more of 500 days of summer.    If you are from the States, please watch the Original Korean My Sassy Girl and bear with the subtitles. Don't be xenophobic, there are some amazing movies out there beyond Hollywood.
B003L20ICE|1.0|I don't know how on earth there's been so much hype about this film. I guess it's because of the big name actors.<br /><br />The relationship between the two women was not at all believable. There is no love between them. There is no sex between them (one scene shows a fully clothed failed attempt, that's all). They seem to be two strangers. And then one of them turns out to not be gay.<br /><br />There are three gratuitous, full-on naked thrusting mixed-gender sex scenes - between a woman who says she's a lesbian and a very hairy man. It makes absolutely no sense at all. There wasn't even a build up between them. The director just put them together. And outside of the director's bubble world of LA, this reinforces a horrible stereotype. And people, it means the character is not gay. I know that labels aren't really important and sexuality can be fluid, but it's the character in the film who calls herself a lesbian. A woman who has sex with a man like that is not gay. That's just plain ridiculous.<br /><br />There's another half-the-movie-long extremely gratuitous mixed-gender sex scene between the sperm donor and another lady. Was this film about a lesbian couple with kids? Nope.<br /><br />I'm not sure what's wrong in Lisa Cholodenko's life that inspired her to make such a horrible film. It is a pity because a story about this type of family could have been interesting. I know that Lisa is together with a woman and they have a child. So it begs the question, is she self-hating? She quite obviously hates lesbians. I can only guess that she's actually straight and trying to turn lesbians straight. Great, the world needs more of that, really.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This is by far the best 3D home movie I have to date. Of course, I only have three but that's from lack of availability, but I digress.     The animation in this movie is better than the Monsters vs Aliens or Despicable Me movies. The people look almost life like. The 3D effects bring you into the movie. As for the story, I've always been a fan and this movie does it justice. As far as a not kid friendly movie, well, it is rated PG for a reason. I won't let my 5 year old watch it for a few years.     I definitely recommend this movie and it's a great movie to show off to your friends.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Same old guys, no women, Clapton's haircut, blah, blah, blah. I read the criticisms and so what? For a day, the assembled players celebrated the guitar. Celebrate the guitar, watch the DVDs or better yet, get yours out and play until the neighbors complain.
0679759328|4.0|Hotel du Lac, by Anita Brookner surprised me.  The first forty or so pages, while beautifully written, were a tad tough to meander through at times.  But then, oh then, all of a sudden, and at some point I can't recall, I was quite happy -- it pulled me in and although it's a quiet and contemplative story, it was really quite interesting and I felt at home with it.    Edith Hope is a romance writer who writes under another name -- she's accomplished, but to be honest, she writes about feelings and events that she's never sure she'll ever have, or at least have forever.  She's withdrawn, and doesn't fit with her \\"friends.\\"    Edith is sent away from \\"civilized\\" society in London to a quaint and quiet hotel in Switzerland following a scandal that it has been deemed should not occur amongst polite and learned men and women.  While there, she encounters a sad variety of characters that initially seem almost so uninteresting, that they are interesting.  Eventually, you are drawn into each one, into their nuances, their sad or internally destructive personalities. While one character, Mrs. Pusey initially impresses upon Edith that she is kind and lovely, it soon becomes evident that she's really just lacking in the same things that most of the hotel guests are without as well -- after all, why are they all sequestered in this hotel, away from family and friends, during a quiet time of season?  It seemed to be that they all were suffering in some way.    Do not expect a flurry of events in the winner of the Man Booker Prize of 1984.  Expect instead a quiet discussion, a studied review of a writer's perspective of those she meets and interacts with, amidst the background of an incredible hotel.  There is not a hurry from one thing to another.  It is a slow exercise of evaluation and word usage to describe each scene, moment, person.  Could it be considered tedious and boring to some?  Perhaps.  Could it also be viewed as deceptively pleasing, slowly building the undercurrent of anticipation for something, something brilliant and cunning to breach the water line and unfold its secret?  Yes.    At times, it was a bit humorous, but I found it to be an overall sad book, about people who were sad and who either were forced to be in exile by others, or simply had nowhere else that they could go.  It's an insightful and thoughtful novel on love, loss, and regret.  Although I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, I would say that if you like a quiet novel that delivers an introspective view on one's own life, then this sad little beauty is a book for you.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|Overall just a great concert - I put it on for my entire family on a new year eve and all generations were enjoying it - from 5 to 65 year olds.  I agree with one of the reviewers that 5.1 mix is not perfect but the overall enjoyment from the concert makes me put the highest rating!
0061997811|5.0|This book is beautiful and informative, providing Harry Potter fans with lots of inside information about the films. One of the things I particularly love about this book is that it talks about the films in conjuction with the books, mentioning and explaining many of the differences between the two, but also how the films have affected the books (in very small ways). I only wish that this book could be twice as long.  Hopefully, it is only the first of its kind, and many more books like this will be published.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw this series on one of the morning shows around Christmas and thought It might be something good for my 12 year old daughter, a non-stop reader who just receieved her first Kindle (tired of her borrowing mine) I wanted her to read about something other than vampires.  I thought I would read it first as I heard it did have brutal parts.  The Hunger Games and in fact all the books are well written.  The author deffinately draws you in.  Thank goodness for the snowstorm and my Kindle!! I read the enire series!!!     This definately has some brutal moments but overall a great book.  You feel like you are in the games too! My daughter saw me reading it and has started it herself.  Now she is hooked!!
B00007KQA3|5.0|I've read the book multiple times and find this movie to be an excelent adaptation.  It captures the hopelessness that's so evident in the book while also giving a few new insights.  Loved the scene with the kids singing on the train.  The contrast between them with their flawless uniforms and clean faces, and the other older riders was truly inspired.  It's not a movie for the kids though.

B004856SQ8|4.0|I've loved to watch the A Team when I was younger, and I was excited when this movie was released. The movie was ok, entertaining. This release includes additional footage. Really it doesn't add anything relevant, but you can catch a glimpse of two of the original actors of the tv series.    Fyu, this blu ray includes spanish track and subtitles
1602839158|4.0|Egan is a talented writer, and I'm glad I picked this one up. The book is less of a novel and more a collection of vignettes about a loosely affiliated group of characters, many (but not all) of whom are connected to the music business in some way. The stories switch voices, perspectives, locations, and decades, but the same themes run beneath all of them -- getting old, getting off-track, finding that the world is passing you by. Most of the pieces in the book are marvels of well-realized characters, poignancy, humor, and subtlety. I liked the way in which characters in one story appear again in later chapters, seen from the point of view of someone else.    That said, I was a little disappointed that the book wasn't a novel. The interconnected histories of the various characters certainly lend themselves to a more traditional narrative arc, and I wouldn't have minded spending more time getting to know Sasha, Bernie, and Scott directly -- the focus on them from different peripheral viewpoints gets to feel a little gimmicky. Still, I can't really judge a work by the story the author chose not to tell. There is something poignant and beautiful about the fleeting connections between each piece, the way each encompasses its own glittering shard of time.    Audiobook note: the narrator is hit-or-miss, nailing some of the many voices in the book but overdoing others. Still, her renditions were competent enough that they didn't get in the way of my enjoyment.
0810997827|5.0|My 4th grade daughter loves these books even though they are for \\"boys.\\"  She reads funny parts aloud to us.  My daughter says, \\"They're funny!  In the book Rodrick Rules, it was funny when Greg was a little kid, he said to another kid, 'You're gonna grow up and get married to some ice cream!  Ha!'\\" (page 110)  Trust me, fellow parents, this is good kid humor.
1597801585|4.0|Despite my hesitation after reading some less-than-favorable reviews, I took a chance on this book and rather liked it. Bacigalupi's hard-edged, confident, cerebral prose resembles that of William Gibson. The story takes place in an ecological dystopia some 200 years in the future, an era when fossil fuels are nearly exhausted, sea levels have risen, and genetically-modified plants and diseases have run amok, wiping out original species. Humankind has regressed backwards both in technology -- relying on specially-bred animals and stored energy springs for power, and using boats and dirigibles to get around -- and in civility, living in a world of xenophobia, factionalism, and human exploitation.  The novel takes place in a future version of Thailand. In Gibson-esque fashion, Bacigalupi introduces a motley cast of characters with intertwining stories, a hustling North American \\"calorie man\\" desperately looking to make a quick fortune from the discovery of lost foodstuffs, a duty-driven officer of a militarized environmental protection force struggling to hold pestilence out of the Thai kingdom, a genetically engineered sex slave who's despised by a xenophobic population but possesses a strange power, and a once-wealthy Chinese refugee who now must make deals to stay alive.  I enjoyed the calm intensity that Bacigalupi brings to his story, the vivid sense of a declined world in motion, where people are nonetheless surviving and living their daily lives as best they are able. I appreciated that the author didn't try to lead readers by the hand, but left us to soak up his reality and a set of intrigues already underway. The Windup Girl's setting, texture, and level of literacy feel quite different from a lot of other science fiction books, but its images and scenes stuck with me more than most. Perhaps this one will be remembered for painting a stunning vision of the-future-in-the-hazy-distance for 2009, in the same way Neuromancer did for 1984.  Criticisms? Well, somereaders have complained that the plot is slow-moving and the characters aren't very involving. The former charge -- arguably true in this case -- rarely bothers me in a good novel, but the latter is hard to deny. The characters, cogs in a complex plot, never quite become sympathetic (we hardly learn anything about the backstory of the American), and the only one I found truly interesting, the vile but mesmerizing Dr. Gibbons, doesn't get much stage time. Still, the book swept me up as its plot strands converged towards a blazing finale, and I would certainly consider Bacigalupi a writer to keep an eye on.  The audiobook reader deserves a lot of praise, with subtle but distinct differences in accent for the various characters.
B0000DDAU9|4.0|Mastodon is a name that won't be forgotten soon. They are constructing a rock-solid career and \\"Remission\\" is one of its first pillars. The musics in this album are made of powerful classic rock materials assembled together to create a modern progressive metal architecture. Gigantic!
1400052173|5.0|I have absolutely no background and little interest in science whatsoever - what little I know about cells, DNA, cloning, etc. is from reading newspaper articles and basic science courses. And even those failed to complete capture my attention.  However, Skloot has a way of turning the revolutionary HeLa cells into a human interest piece. Like many others, I didn't think about the \\"story\\" behind the medicine - the \\"story\\" behind the people who came up with these medical marvels. Embodied in this book is a time capsule of history - complete with racism, bioethics, cell culture, and more - all told through the eyes of author who dared to seek the story behind the HeLa cells.
B000002JNJ|3.0|product was a nice clean disc but what really got me was the unsealed CD case and the damage on the CD case it came in. the CD itself was perfect.
0439023513|4.0|possibly ginormous spoilers ahead (I sincerely apologize to those who cringe at spliced words.)<br />All in all, I found the Hunger Games Trilogy exciting and fun, if oddly grim. Mockingjay isn't really so much about the Hunger Games. It focuses more on the Civil War on Panem. I enjoyed the fact that District 13 wasn't clearly the shining white knights coming to rescue everyone. I did not enjoy the long, drawn out mission Katniss sends herself (and her hapless team) on. It just seemed like a good excuse to kill people in interesting ways. This isn't really supposed to be a science fiction book (I don't think), yet there are elements of mutants, etc. This would make an interesting graphic novel. It'd be interesting to see what a comic artist would do with such grotesque visions of death and destruction.<br /><br />I listened to the audio CD, which I'm sure has its advantages and disadvantages in and of itself. Anyway, I found Prim's death almost superfluous. There are so many other ways that this could have been accomplished to a better end than leaving the reader/ listener with the \\"ah, well that stinks\\" feeling. It's so lah-de-dah, ho-hum, another one bites the dust that I actually missed it the first time around and had to back up a few tracks to actually hear it.<br /><br />It annoyed me that Katniss doesn't actually really talk about her children by name. She obliquely references them as \\"the boy\\" and \\"the girl,\\" and I get that we're supposed to believe her severely emotionally damaged by all that she's gone through... but honestly, a name would have been nice. The Gale v Peeta thing just kinda made me laugh in the end. I won't spoil it for you, but I will say that I'd have chosen the other guy. :-)<br /><br />Is it something you'd want to read? Yes<br />Is it something you'd want to read more than once? Um, not really, no.<br />Is it worth your time and money? Yes.<br />Is it worth your time, money, and emotional angst? No.
B000JJ4PDA|5.0|Great rock music with comedy. Being the clean version, the vulgar words that are omitted and substituted with other rhyming words are quite funny. However, some people may still find it offensive. Use of words like \\"mother trucker\\" or \\"mother hubber\\" for substitution, \\"buck it\\", etc....If you love Jack Black, have a great sense of humor and can accept the rhyming replacements, then this album is worth a look.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|K West came with straight heat for this album.  When listening it definitely sounds like a work of art.<br />[[ASIN:B003X2O6KW My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]
031603438X|5.0|I'm not sure if this is the best music biography I've ever read; Dylan's Chronicles, Patti Smith's Just Kids, and Miles Davis' disturbing Miles: the Autobiography are stiff competition. None of those made me laugh out loud repeatedly like this one did, though, making it, all in all, the most entertaining non-fiction book I've read in a long time. Keith is a gifted raconteur, a gentleman outlaw, and an artist whose passion is never far from the surface.
B000FSME1A|5.0|It was good to see both versions of the film.  Learned a lot just listening to Coppola's voice-over and reasons for changes he made in the script, casting and post production.  I would have liked for his wife's documentary to be included in this 'complete dossier' but I will be getting that when the DVD is made available.  I always thought the sound quality and the score of the film were outstanding and seeing how much time, effort and pain went into that part of the post production was a revelation.  I would have liked to have heard more opinions of the making of the film from the cast and crew and how they made it through the trying times of delays, torrential storms, Harvey Keitel's departure and Martin Sheen's heart attack. But it ranks highly in my estimation of films about Viet Nam and war films in general.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|I bought this movie thinking it would be like all the other Christmas Carol movies.  It is a great movie for adults and \\"mature\\" adolescents, but definately not for toddlers or children under the age of 5.  My daughter who loves Scooby Doo movies where there are monsters all the time, was scared to the point of shaking in my arms and we had to turn it off.  So FYI:  not the Christmas Carol you intended to purchase.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|The reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because even in the \\"real\\" world, the gun fights were unreal.  Like are they all special forces secret assasins?    Also, with so many bullets flying around, you'd think they'd wear body armor instead of their GQ suits.    This movie borrowed a lot from the Matrix; from the fights, guns, to having an Architect, and Ken Watanabe being a Morpheus type.  It upped the game with better special effects and, do I need to even say it, better acting from the main character.      It's all worth it for the nail biting slow motion, everything at stake, life or death build up in the end.
0446679089|2.0|Review contains spoilers<br /><br />After listening to 15+ hours of Nelson's wangsty rude detective John Corey I ended up hoping the two female leads would run off to Bermuda together and leave John to whine some more about his injuries and his ex and antagonize everyone he meets. If any character was in need of an attitude adjustment, it's john. John's entire MO is to irritate everyone, and act like he's 12, and set up a petty chest-beating relationship with any other guy he dislikes or is handsome which is apparently half the male population. His entire personality is so over the top it is neither clever or entertaining but cheesy.<br /><br />I purchased the novel, thinking it would be a fun thriller about a potential bio terror weapon falling into the hands of a hostile party. Instead the story is about this egocentric detective and how awesome he is at smarting off to every authority figure and breaking as many laws as he pleases.  Not impressive.  I really began to dislike John about the time he begins to play head games with the female detective and refuses to tell her who the bad guy is, thus putting three people in danger. Johns' lack of professionalism jeopardized their safety and prolonged this agonizing story another few hours. My second falling out with this character was when his partner is shot and he insists on pursuing the villain on a boat during a near hurricane, despite having very little practical experience with boating. *Eyerolls* ludicrous. If he cared one whit for the girl, he'd see her to safety. Finally, I was really kind of skeeved out when John disembowels the villain and tosses his entrails in his face. I just couldn't believe any sane human would do something like that. I felt like gagging.<br /><br />End Spoilers<br />I have to give the author credit for creating a hero that I just hated.  I ended up rooting the bad guys just because they were vastly more entertaining than the smart alec detective.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW  Walt Disney's \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" is a phenomenal accomplishment.  With the voice talents of Adriana Caselotti and Lucille LaVerne, among many others, the 1937 film works on a visceral emotional level, and features wonderful songs.  It combines stunning visuals with a first-rate story.  The extreme contrast between the unquestioned goodness of Snow White and the evil malevolence of the queen serves the story very well.  Certain scenes come to mind as exemplary for combining artistic values with emotional effectiveness.  Among them are(SPOILER)Snow White's scared run through the forest, and the psychological tricks her imagination plays on her.  The queen's famous transformation into the old crone is executed with fearless abandon.  Arguably no other telling of this story places such emphasis on the dwarfs.  Happy, Dopey, Sleepy, Bashful, Doc, Sneezy, and Grumpy are all uniquely created personalities and very likable overall.  Their great song \\"Heigh Ho\\" is a marvelous introduction for them.  This Blu-Ray edition of the film preserves the look of its original artwork while heightening some color and motion aspects.  For instance, Snow White's journey through the forest with the animals is subtly visually improved by the color pallette the Blu-Ray format affords.  A minor complaint is that Snow White's prince is one of two of the most boring princes in Disney's fairytale movie catalogue(the prince from \\"Cinderella\\" is the other one).  However, Walt Disney's \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" is a perfect classic in all other respects.

B003I55BIA|5.0|I have not read a really great book in awhile. Once I picked this book up, I could not put it down. I thought it was a great read and I recommend it to everyone. This is now one of my favorite books. I liked how it showed that two different people can come together and act civilized. It showed to not judge people on what they,but for who they truly are on the inside. I loved this book and hope everyone else does to.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I Enjoyed this movie very much. I have a hard time finding entertainment with creative storylines but this movie surpassed all hopes I ever had. It will be hard for future Directors to top this film. The special effects did'nt keep me, The actors didn't draw me, But the story engulfed me.
B00004RJ74|4.0|This film has almost a cult following...Salma Hayek plays a small but integral part in this movie. She is sexy and superb (on screen and off)...but her dance and interaction with Quentin Taratino's character is not just memorable but the basis for many sexual fantasies. Maybe my favorite scene is in the store when the clerk, on fire, gets up and starts firing at the two while he is nothing but flames...arguably the best gun battle in cinema, thanks Mr. Taratino for writing that into the script. Cheech Marin plays three different characters and while he is not billed at the top he is almost half the movie cast...everyone gets a kick out of Cheech.

I bought this as a gift for a close friend who loves the Goonies. We were amazed by this blu ray. Also, he loved all the extras that came with the movie. Great choice for a Goonies lover!
031603438X|2.0|The book definitely wasn't a real interesting read as it seemed to lack any real structure.  I personally would have liked to have heard a little less about his junkie escapades and more of his musical exploits, his instruments, amps, gear etc.  Oh well, we can all be critics I guess.  I am just amazed that the guy is still alive.

B003UESJFQ|3.0|Made in Dagenham is a good film marred by one of the worst scripts I've seen in a long time. That's a shame, since the acting is generally excellent. The film is an interesting piece of social history, taking us back to Britain in the 1960s when men were men, women knew their place and the industrial sector ruled supreme. A group of women at Ford's enormous Dagenham car (auto) plant go on strike to demand equal pay with the male workers. The male-dominated union pretends to back them while in reality trying to undermine the strikers, since they fear it could derail various work grievances presented by male workers. The movie quickly bogs down in cliches. We meet the quiet female worker who slowly discovers she can be an activist, the union activist raised by a single mother who secretly helps the women, the upper class wife of a Ford executive whose husband treats her like dirt and who helps the strikers, the chief striker's husband, who resents what she's doing but slowly realises she's right, the hard-nosed woman who turns out to have a heart of .... and so on and so on. The women eventually win out and it's a heart-warming tale. Yet it could have been so much better had someone edited and reworked the script.
B000EDQCC8|5.0|These discs are the \\"THX\\" remastering of the original versions of the movie.  The same version was converted to VHS but has much lower quality due to the format.  The DVD/BR releases have both the special edition versions and non-remastered versions of the originals.  This version is MUCH better quality than the non-remastered originals and doesn't have all of the annoying changes of the special edition.  If you happen to have an LD player.. I'd pick this up.
B000OCY7JE|2.0|Half an hour into this film I was hooked, wondering what the director would do with what had started out as a remarkable work. At the end I was yawning. After the Wedding starts off tremendously -- a Danish aid worker in India learns he will get the large donation he needs to keep his childrens' home running. The catch is that he has to fly to Denmark to meet the donor, who plays with him, suggesting he needs time to really decide whether to hand over the money. \\"I have to go to a wedding this weekend,\\" he says. \\"Why not come with me?\\" The aid worker turns up at the wedding to discover his long-lost former girlfriend there. She's married to the donor and may or may not be the mother to the aid worker's child, one he never knew he had.      Here's where we are 30 minutes in. And then it all falls apart spectacularly, dissolving into near gibberish as we're hit with melodrama piled on melodrama and bizarre plot twist following on bizarre plot twist. Sadly, none of it is convincing, and by the end I just wanted it to stop. The aid worker starts off as a cipher, someone we know little about, and that's how he stays all the way through. This movie is a mess.
0515141429|3.0|This is the first Lee Child book I've read. Well, actually I heard the unabridged audio recording. I like mystery books for long car rides; plenty of action to keep me awake, no serious thinking which is hard to do while concentrating on the road. The reader for the audiobook was excellent. He had a 100 voices, and I was never in doubt as to who was speaking or what character was which.     Killing Floor starts off with action--and a puzzle--right from the start, which was a good beginning and captured my attention right away. The hero, Jack Reacher, is the sort of traditional laconic, hard-boiled type, who finds himself mixed up with super baddies who have to be taken out. Here's some of the rookie mistakes Child made (disclaimer: I've so far read none of his other books). First, one of the main characters has a Harvard PhD in criminology. That's fine as a way to flag \\"this character is really smart\\" and set him up as a force to taken seriously. But then Child drops the ball. The Harvard guy (also supposedly a 20 year Boston PD vet) never has any clue as to what to do next, always asks Reacher \\"what do we do now?\\", solves none of the puzzles in the story, and even has to think about the difference between singular and plural possessives. Show, don't tell, remember? But we're only told that the character is super smart, and never shown that he is. In fact, he comes across as kind of a dope who sounds like James Earl Jones. Reacher himself is described in terms of repetitive tropes (e.g. he is always shrugging to communicate).     It takes the protagonists a terribly long time to piece the puzzle all together. I saw the basic outline of the solution long before they did, which I shouldn't have. There were also some troubling plot holes--why would one of the Treasury Dept's most senior people personally (and without backup) do a field investigation? After two Treasury agents are murdered, why aren't the Feds swarming like ants all over? I'm sort of willing to suspenddisbelief about some of the plot holes, but it could be tighter.    I'll give the series another shot, though. Maybe for another long car trip.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|The service and prices of Amazon are wonderful.  I always receive my orders promptly and am always satisfied. I tried to find this video locally, but was unsuccessful.  It is always so easy just finding it at Amazon.  Saves time and gas and is so convenient.      Thank you Amazon.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|this movie is what i beleive to be an instant classic. although in recent years disney movies have not been as good as the originals, from the very begining of the movie \\"Tangled\\" i loved it! :)
031603438X|5.0|This book does the job on all counts. Keith discusses everything: His life, his family, his women, the Stones, their songs, Mick, his relations with him, you name it. It fulfills on all counts. If anything I would have liked a bit more thorough discussion of the \\"peak\\" Stones, from '68 -'72. He doesn't really address the music of that period in meticulous detail. For example, I know from interviews Keith has done that he played not only the lead guitar but also bass on \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\" Keith was also the only - repeat, ONLY - guitar player on \\"Beggars Banquet,\\" Brian Jones did not play a single note. Jimmy Miller (the producer of the \\"peak\\" Stones) said that. Keith mentions Jimmy Miller, but not in that great of detail. Why did they select him? Why did they pick the songs they did to go on the \\"peak\\" albums, etc.? Keith mentions why Jimmy Miller was fired (dope) also, but could have addressed it in greater detail. He could have discussed Mick Taylor more thoroughly too. Oh well. I still love ya, Keith!     This is a great book. I'm glad I bought it and you will too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of his best works.  I am a huge fan and this book reminded me as to why. Two thumbs up!
B002ZG9846|5.0|I like the idea - why don't we be like our superheroes? Well, the whole costume thing might be a bit much for most of us but still a great kernel for a story line. In this seminal story arc, the main character gets wrapped up in the battle for good versus evil and finds out he is in way over his head after it is too late. What happens? he has to step up and put himself to the test.<br /><br />It is a story about comic book readers for comic book readers. It can be a little gory at times and Nick Cage... I just don't get it. He was OK in parts but I had to think a few times about what he was doing before I realized he was trying to do a bad imitation of the Adam West TV Batman. I think it was an intentional bad imitation. If so it was the deepest thinking the movie had. Very raw and up front; good guys that are flawed and good. Bad guys that are flawed and bad.<br /><br />I went with the Blue Ray / DVD / Digital copy version and love it. Easy to transfer that digital version to your media device and the extras are great. Watch the extras to gain an appreciate for the authors and artists that worked on this project. A bunch of guys dedicated to the story and lets hope they run with it.<br /><br />Worth your time and hey, it is a set up for the next movie. Next, next and next! keep them coming.<br /><br />Will<br />Fairbanks AK

B0019LY5IM|5.0|I never actually watched this series while it was still in syndication, but I am so glad for DVD and Blu-Ray sets!  Lost has become one of my favorite shows, and may even top the list!  Season 5, while still entertaining, causes a bit of problems because of the confusing timelines and jumping between different time periods, but overall I enjoyed it very much.  If you are a fan of the series this is definitely a must-own, not only to complete your set, but also because it starts to unravel some of the mysteries that have been awaiting an explanation since Season 1!  Very glad I made this purchase, and I just hope Season 6 is not a let down for the end of the series.
0395389496|5.0|Gave this book to my daughter who is a first year teacher with 18 four year old students.  My daughter's students really loved this book and so did my fifth grade students!  My daughter gave her students each a bell so they could see if they could hear the bell.  Beautiful book and excellent addition to any Christmas collection.
144937980X|5.0|For those of you older than 25 you may remember LOGO. Processing is kind of like this generation's LOGO and this book is a great introduction for Processing and programming in general. For beginners and kids this book is clear and gives a good headstart into coding. For more experienced programmers the book can be quickly skimmed through to get a basic idea of syntax and the cool things that Processing can do. Highly recommended! And cheap, too! There are $50 books that do the same thing and not as well.
0375842209|5.0|Fantastic book that I could not put down. The perspective of the story is from death and it gave the whole story an interesting new way of looking at what happened during Nazi Germany.

B00275EHJG|5.0|One line: Amazing movie.    At first I was dismayed when I heard that Pixar was making another Toy Story movie.  This came after their relationship with Disney was shakey, with rumors that a separate non-pixar team would take over the work of this production.  I stayed away from looking up anything related to this film, anxious that what I would learn would break my heart.  The trailers deliberately did not reveal much regarding the plot of the film so I was pretty much kept ignorant right up to watching it.    My goodness, it was breathtaking when I finally saw it.    Anyone who has felt that little tug when they left home, when they had just launched from the nest, will understand immediately the hart of this movie.  The nostalgia, the sentimental feelings.  All of it, distilled perfectly.  This movie somehow has kept that same charm and personality from the first film.  Wonderfully inventive and with that irreproducible Pixar polish, this film will grab you in a big bear hug and not let go, even after the credits have stopped rolling.    Regarding the blu ray.  Sharp, clear, good sound.  It's a digital film w/ a digital transfer.  Straightforward.  The Incredibles still has the better behind the scenes stuff, though.  This one is OK.  Fun commentary.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Simply put, this movie is one of the best movies/mini series ever made. It's a western, love story, historical drama and so much more. The actors are all superb and the story lines are compelling. As you watch you feel for these people and you CARE about what happens to them.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I really did enjoy this movie it was fantastic. If you are a chef you will enjoy it even more. The book is amazing!!!
B0009A40ES|5.0|If you thought the Wall Street crowd who contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 was bad, you should remember the 1980s. You should meet Patrick Bateman<br /><br />The 80s were  when the children of the 1960s counter-culture baby boomers rejected the values of their parents: chased a life of wealth and status. Coin sized roast pork with tropical lemon mint sauce, kiwi exfoliating body rub, $400 power ties and $15 dollar glasses of vodka were the goodies that the \\"yuppies\\" used to display and confirm their status.<br /><br />For Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), these toys were a front for much darker impulses. Bateman has the urge to kill: women, homeless people, rivals at work, anyone that happens to be in his way. Humanity is an annoyance to Patrick, a target for his ice cold, encompassing rage.<br /><br />His life and the crimes shown in American Psycho are filled with all the trappings and yuppie  rituals: the half hour skin lubricating showers, pricey dinners, and his relationship with the women he plans to marry but cares nothing about.  Buying the best tie, working towards a buff body, torturing a call girl: its all route and all the same to him<br /><br />All this is treated with brilliant comic darkness: watch how, each time he commits a murder, he first makes a speech about the philosophical implications of vapid 1980s songs like Whitney Houston's \\"The Greatest Love Of All\\" or Huey Lewis's<br />\\"Hip To Be Square.\\" The violence is ironic and funny:  we are  able to focus on the social satire, not lose the points in moral outrage.<br /><br />Bateman is empty and narsicistic to his very core, but so is the entire yuppie environment he has chosen. He is in \\"murders and executions,\\" he reveals when asked. He meant to say \\"Mergers and Acquisitions. Lines like this are layered through American Psycho, as if one action is akin to the other.<br /><br />Bateman's cold killer persona is not unique in this shark pool: he is just the shark big enough to take these instincts to another level. Cutthroat business deals, murder: its all a zero sum game here with sociopath's rules.<br /><br />And you'll never have more fun than when you watch Bateman play that game in American Psychodeals, murder: its all a zero sum game here with sociopath's rules.    And you'll never have more fun than when you watch Bateman play that game in American Psycho
B003T70EWA|4.0|Downloaded this after seeing Lee and Joe Bonamassa jamming on a Guitar Center Sessions show. Like a lot of this album, and the fact that it features a lot of new guitarists. Obviously some stuff will appeal to some more than others, given the nature of the project. I am a huge fan of Neal Schon and Steve Lukather, as well as Andy McKee, and of course, Lee Ritenour.  Many other great guitarists, plus great backup musicians like Tal Wilkenfeld and Vinnie Colaiuta, Paulinho Da Costa, etc.     Major Quibble: WHY DON'T THE TRACK LISTINGS SHOW THE ARTISTS FEATURED ON EACH TRACK? They all say Lee Ritenour. Even went to Lee's site and Concord Records, nothing. Very annoying. On a project with so many name players, I want to know who I am listening to when each new track plays. If you are introducing new artists, why not let me know when I am hearing them? STUPID! The devil is in the details.    I am going into my iTunes and adding them as I figure them out from the videos on YouTube. Still, many are not there. NOT COOL.
B00005RDRO|3.0|I have to admit that with an all-star cast of actors and actresses I expected a fantastic movie.  Unfortunately, while the acting was amazing, the incredibly stupid story just ruined the movie for me.<br /><br />Story - Five world-class detectives have been invited to a mansion to solve a murder.  The catch?  The murder hasn't happened yet.  Each of the detectives brings along a partner with which they have somewhat of a relationship with.  Once they arrive at the mansion, chaos ensues and the comedy quickly sets in.  Unfortunately, due to how the story is written, everything that happens intentionally confusing.  Scenes contradict each other, pointless scenes are added, and although it's supposed to be hilarious, it ends up looking sloppy.  The ending (without giving anything away) is incredibly disappointing, especially after there is so much build-up to it.<br /><br />Acting - However, I must say, that though the story can be crazy at times, the acting is top notch all the way through.  All of the actors/actresses portray their characters perfectly, and the characters are priceless!  Whether it's the zany Chinese detective or the wheelchair-bound nurse, they will all crack you up with their quirkiness, and they are what truly make the movie watchable.<br /><br />Comedy - Where the film is funny, it is hilarious.  However, all of the jokes are not necessarily funny.  Some jokes fall flat and leave us viewers realizing how unbelievably cheesy that line was.  However, these moments can be overlooked in anticipation of the next line that will crack us up.<br /><br />Bonus Features - Also included on the DVD is an interview with the creator of the movie and trailers for this movie and it's sequel (The Cheap Detective).<br /><br />Overall - Overall, this movie has some lackluster comedy and a truly atrocious story.  But the fantastic acting truly saves it, as do some of the extremely comical lines.  As you can probably tell from some of the other reviews, this movie isloved by many reviewers here on Amazon, so if you want to give it a watch or two, you might enjoy it more than I did.  But I honestly have to say that I recommend choosing another movie over this one.
076781326X|5.0|My classroom was reading Oliver Twist and I wanted them to see this movie I recalled from when I was a kid.  I ordered it and watched it before I showed it to my students.  They loved it, even though they are 21st Century middle school kids. It has held up well.

B001HN697M|3.0|if you enjoyed the first two films in the series, you will (I think) enjoy this one as well.  This is an \\"origin\\" film, which goes back to the beginning to explain the conflict between the Lycans (a.k.a. werewolves) and Vampires.  So in chronological order, you should watch this film first, then \\"Underworld\\", then \\"Underworld:  Evolution\\".<br /><br />Lucian the Lycan leads a Lycan uprising against the Vampires because they no longer want to be in servitude to the Vampires.  The story has a interesting twist in that Lucian's love is the daughter of the Vampire king himself.  So we have a sort of forbidden love conflict as part of the story which adds some emotional depth.<br /><br />Determined to break enslavement of his people, Lucian faces off against the Death Dealer army of the vampires in a bid for Lycan independence.<br /><br />Rhona Mitra, as Sonja the vampire king's daughter, really is in the center of the story and delivers a great performance.
B00005OCMR|1.0|Are you kidding? Who drove the prices up? Do you corporate fat cats WANT us to pirate this movie? It's a great shame, because Tron is such a good movie, I hate to one star it!
B001HN694K|4.0|I have to admit watching the first half was quite boring.  But after the plot started to unfold and everything else, it was a good movie.  I almost quit watching it because I felt it had way too much gore in it to be a kid's movie.  With the dragon's head being cut off, the snowdog's eye being plucked out, and the girl's arm being scratched it was almost too much.  But after all that nonsense, it was a great movie.  The ending was very good.  What looked like a rather boring and uneventful movie, turned out to be quite good at the end earning it 4 stars.
B001O1O71C|5.0|this book made me cry, laugh, and see the good in other people's hearts. The movie was wonderful also, but i do have one opinion. I think bruno's friend shoulve lived. It is a very sad ending but it enlightened me how powerful friendship can be.  -Emily, age 11
B004CURZFC|5.0|It was a visual delight .. The story is the same good wins over evil. But the visual presentation is just awesome. I wish I would have seen this in 3-D. Well I loved the movie and it is a great great movie for kids and young ducklings.
1589795474|3.0|I skipped many parts of this book, as it contains too many statistics, maybe it was intended for the cynics. However, the writer made a good and reasonable point at the very beginning of the book. This book would make a good material for documentary, as there are many surprising facts about millionaires. But if you want to be wealthy, this is merely a good start. It gives you the right attitude about wealthiness.<br /><br />You will also have a question some time after finishing the book; \\"if you will have to live frugally, why do you want to be wealthy in the first place?\\" or \\"How can I cash out my investment to enjoy life?\\"

B001FB55H6|1.0|Not to be rude or stereotypical, but the majority of the other reviewers must be male. I'm female. I love comic books and super heroes. I even love a darker storyline (anyone remember Johnny the Homicidal Maniac?). But this movie just got worse and worse the more I watched. Finally, 1.5 hours in, I started speeding up or skipping scenes. There's only so much rape, child murder, pregnant ladies being shot, women being beat up, people exploding, pointless breast shots, homophobia, etc. a girl can take. After watching (the majority of) the whole thing, I'm not even sure what the plot was...um...a group of (sort-of) heroes bring world peace by being a-holes - now add 2 hours of really uncomfortable and/or horrifying scenes. Maybe the graphic novel had the artwork going for it, but this movie gets a zero rating for me. I waited over a year to finally see the movie and this version in particular, and not even the naked blue eyecandy makes up for the awful plot. I'll be taking my copy to Bookman's.
B001KPK6Q2|3.0|This is the first artist my 5 year old has fallen in love with. It was easy to download and now she can listen to You Belong To Me over and over and over.
1600242405|4.0|I love Johnny Depp, but he isn't quite up to speed in reading a book for an audio edition.  He starts off in a monotone and suddenly at chapter 5 dives into rather cartoonish British-speak.  At chapter 11 the monotone returns. Where was the editor's input?    Mostly it is reading but there is some dialogue and it is impossible to distinguish anyone else's voice (with the exception of Bobby Keyes).  Also there should be a 3 second or so pause between paragraphs that change direction.  To have Johnny reading something about Anita and jump right into something about guitar strings without the slightest pause is a bit disconcerting.      Listen to something like \\"The Hot Kid\\" or \\"Up in Honey's Room\\" to see the difference.  They are both stories by Elmore Leonard and are both read by Arliss Howard.  Of course Elmore Leonard's books always have snappy dialogue and Arliss Howard manages several voices quite well.  Male, female, old, young, they all have a distinct voice.  Lenny Henry does a great job reading Neil Gaiman's \\"Anansi Boys\\" too. Too bad Keith didn't hire one of them!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Grabbed this on Blue Ray in anticipation of the visuals looking more amazing than when they blew me away on broadcast TV & DVD (bought the miniseries on DVD long ago).  I am not disappointed.      Look, this show probably has a million lengthy reviews here where regular folks, hard sci fi fans, and uber-nerds of various stripes have gone on and on about how incredible this series is.  Count me in, but here's the quick version:     The rebooted Battlestar Galactica is at once extremely careful to honor the spirit of the original and yet absolutely unafraid to take true risks.  Switching characters' sexes, adding layers of psychological intrigue (that are arguably not truly original but are still extremely well-executed), changing or updating designs for ships and costumes, and wrapping the show up neatly enough at the end of a run that turned on a dime and on its ear more than once--all of this works amazingly well.  The risks pay off, and the true fans of the old show will see the send-ups and nods to the original everywhere they look.  But the cheese factor the old show is often accused of harboring is absolutely gone, and everything is played straight and dead serious.  The show is undeniably hard sci fi but yet remains completely accessible to people who just like intense story.    I haven't wanted to keep hitting play simply because I didn't want to get off the adrenaline rush a show offers since I sat down and watched 24 for the first time (which was actually on DVD--what a ride!).    If you haven't watched this show through before, man, do I envy you.  You are in for quite a wild ride.

B001OQCV6A|2.0|Robert Downey looks great (nice shirts, Sherlock), but he swallows most of his hastily delivered lines and is often incomprehensible.  My wife and I would turn to each other laughing after he'd spoken and then exchange gibberish in imitation of the vocally impaired detective.  (I suspect that Downey, insecure about his British accent, decided to enfog most of what he was forced by the script to say.)    Lord Blackstone emerges as the hero if only because he's about the only significant (male) character whose lines can be comprehended.  Bring him back!  In fact, give him his own franchise (and it's hard to believe this Sherlock will become one).
B002ZG9940|1.0|Hard to believe George Clooney would even tarnish his career with this one.  Nothing exciting happens in pretty much the whole movie.  Even the scenes with gunfire are predictable and underwhelming.  This one seems like an 'art' film that snuck through the cracks into the mainstream.  If you are expecting action, suspense, drama or much of anything else, you'll be disappointed.  If you like watching muted dialog, maybe you'll like it.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|With the endless commercial promotion of the movie, I thought this was going to be a flop. I bought it (from a friend's recommendation) to see what the fuss was all about. With the Christmas weekend storm of 29 inchs of snow, I wasn't going anywhere. Popped the movie in, and was actually entertained. If you got a couple of hours to spare, you wont be disappointed.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I'm a fan of hard rock mostly, but I like any music that's high-quality and well-performed.  Mumford & Sons really delivers on this album with powerful lyrics that dig into your soul as you keep listening. I'm listening to this album right now, actually. :) Got the CD back in June 2010 and haven't taken it out of my 5CD changer for 6 months. It really stands up to repeat play.     Simply put, if you love rock; if you appreciate the roots of bluegrass and folk music; if you appreciate well-written, thought-provoking lyrics; if you love a band that plays as hard as it can sometimes just because it's fun -- then you'll appreciate Mumford & Sons.    And if you ever get a chance to see them live, GO. It's an experience you'll never forget!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|To anyone considering buying this boxset, do not hesitate. For me, this is the finest cop show ever produced. The casting, plot lines and sheer jaw-dropping standard of acting are so superior to other imitative series. Each episode is multi-layered, and holds the viewer's attention. Michael Chiklis and his team are so credible in their roles that it is easy to forget that the show is fictional. The tight scripting and breathless pace demand repeated viewings. Personally, I don't feel that there are any weak episodes - in my opinion, the only other series that would receive this accolade is \\"The Sopranos\\".    I ordered from the UK and was highly impressed with the quality of service, excellent communication and speed of delivery.    An absolutely brilliant purchase - cannot fault Amazon or the product itself - 11/10!
B000NU2CY4|5.0|A lot of people were trying to weight down the rating on this movie, because they were claiming they didn't master it from the director's cut.  In this case, the theatrical release IS the Director's cut.  Their is an extended edition of this movie on the disc which adds a few scenes and the director outright says the theatrical release is the Director's cut.  These people were rating the movie without owning it.  Now that you know about the Director's cut, look at the picture and you will know that this is a great quality Blu-ray release.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|Matt Smith just reeks of brilliance.  He's strange, funny, has a lot of heart, yet still seems like he is an alien from a totally different planet.  Yeah, David Tennant had some brilliant years as The Doctor but the new series has never been better, and Matt Smith proves to be the best Doctor yet.  Steven Moffat shows his exceptional skill as a showrunner; he manages to tie together the entire season without making it confusing for newcomers and casual viewers.  He also proves to be far superior to previous showrunner Russel T. Davies at writing season openers and closers, writing the best premier and finale so far.  Of course the season is not perfect, and like every show there are a couple of dud episodes (like Victory of the Daleks or Vampires of Venice).  However, there are some episodes unlike any of the previous seasons (The Lodger) and some concepts they usually get wrong that they pulled off brilliantly (Vincent and the Doctor).<br /><br />One more little thing: lots of people expected episodes from Moffat as great as his work in the past.  Yeah, I agree, none of his episodes this year were as stand-out as Blink or The Girl in the Fireplace, but the overall excellence of this batch of episodes totally makes it worthwhile for me.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I decided to buy this because I loved Alien and Aliens and figured the other 2 movies included (Aliens 3 and 4) would just be bad bonuses but for some reason when I watched these movies in order back to back it made me appreciate the entire collection a lot more.  Sure the prison setting of 3 may not be the best and the directing/writing of 4 makes it a semi-confusing mess but they all work together to form one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time.    For Alien and Aliens they went out of their way to clean up the first 2 movies the best they could and the result are 2 great looking transfers!  The other 2 movies don't fare quite as well but still look great on Blu-ray!

0385474547|5.0|This is a great book. I was shocked to see as many negative reviews as I did. The people who have given negative reviews must not understand the book very well. It is an intriguing story that provides an invaluable look at textbook ego-centrism(something that Americans should become well educated on). It is not the most fast paced book when providing the reader with important background information(it is key you understand the culture of the village to take away the lesson that Achebe wants you to), but still has no problem holding your attention and providing you with great, well-cultured entertainment. I bought this book for a college class(it was required) and ended up really enjoying it. Now that the class is over and I can sell the book back, I think I'll just keep it for my personal collection(I enjoyed it that much).
B0031RAOVY|5.0|As an animal lover, I was deeply touched by the story of the movie. I didn't just love the story, I also admired the making of this movie. The dog actors (am sure they casted for baby hachi and grown-up hachi) are obviously some of the most talented dogs I have ever seen. Hachi is a movie for everyone as it gives you a profound message about a symbiotic relationship between animal and human. After all, we are all part of nature.

B001F0WXY0|5.0|Five plus star book. Truly a fantastic book. I have owned several copies and currently have two now including a second printing. I would love to have this on kindle but you guys are just too greedy. Slapping 40th anniversary on the cover is not worth another ten dollars. And who wrote any extras here? The son with his abominations on the world of Dune? This is not even in the top 500 scifi on kindle thanks to your greed. I checked.<br /><br />Buy it used, with a early edition cover for three bucks. Very satisfying.<br /><br />update: It went up a buck? It was 1599 before I swear. Good luck with sales greedy Grady.<br /><br />The pricing algorithm for this one is set very high. Lowest price I've seen yet was 13.99. Hovers at 14.99 most often. And 15.99 is fairly common. Used, shipped to your house, 4-6 bucks. And still not in the top 500. Go team greed.

The author does a excellent job of looking at different fields and using real life examples to show how lists save lives and make jobs easier.   I have given the book out twice  to people in my office. It is a quick read and filled with solid insight.  The book is heavy in the medical,  but that should be expected.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the greatest books written and with a clear meaning to it! The government does not own you! SUCH a great series, all of them are fantastic, BUY THE HUNGER GAMES!     Ages twelve and younger shouldn't read this book, there are LOTS of brutal killing scenes.     I think one of the best things about this book, besides the amazing plot and action, was that Katniss, the main charatcer, wasnt obnoxious like most heroines out there! She's brave, strong, independant, and an all around great character!    Thank you so much Suzanne Collins, you are one fantastic writer, you're one of my biggest inspirations and thanks for an amazing series of tremendous books!     TEAM KATNISS, PEETA AND GALE!!!!!!!!

0756665949|4.0|This Encyclopedia is 400 pages of information only hard-core Lost fans will know. It's jam-packed with pictures and interesting side notes, which is one of the positive things about the book. Obviously, this is an encyclopedia on Lost, and therefore, you can form a pretty good picture of what you'll be getting content-wise. As far as new information goes, you'll be hard-pressed to find \\"new\\" answers in this book. There may very well be connections that you didn't make the first time around during the show, or information presented in a different way that it will seem like new information to you. I did have a few issues with the encyclopedia though. First of all, it seems to be very character based, but not plot based. Characters will get pages upon pages of the book dedicated to them, but \\"Time Travel\\" (the thing I was most interested in reading about because I was so confused by it!), was merely relegated to a small side-box on a page about the island. I found it annoying how MINOR MINOR characters got an article at all. \\"Darlene\\" who you may or may not remember as selling Hurley a Shi Tzu T-Shirt in season 4 got her own article. She was in the show for not even 2 minutes and was never given a name. Her entire article consisted of 3 sentences. She is not the only character to have a similar thing happen to them. When you add them all together, so much space was wasted on irrelevant things that it could probably account for dozens of pages, which could better be used by a graph on, let's say, keeping with my former Time Travel idea, on a timeline of Time Jumps or whatnot. Although not a huge deal, I felt like some articles were entirely useless and the space could have been given to expand upon other things, like the Flash-Sideways Characters, whom I feel were really underdeveloped in the book. Each character only got a 2 page spread with very minimal writing and mostly pictures. The Encyclopedia is very vague and not in depth. This will be fine for the average reader, but I feel like hard-core Losties won't be satisfied. There were a couple of spelling errors here and there, as well as errors that conflicted with the continuity on the show (see here for further information on this: [...]) The pictures really are beautiful, though. The book is well organized and has a nice index in the back. In general, the book is pretty nicely done, as far as the slip cover and the cover underneath (which is a silhouette of the front book jacket). It also has never-before seen maps and close ups of props. Hardcore Fans will enjoy closeups of pages from Faraday's journal, a look at Rousseau's map of the island, and covers of Geronimo Jackson albums (which have little easter eggs sprinkled around them.) In the end, Lost fans will enjoy revisiting the island one last time and consulting the book to try and help them reach their own conclusions about the series. This book won't make those conclusions for them, just as the show and the producers wanted.
0971407614|5.0|This book really works and is full of wisdom. You can agree or disagree with some nutritional data in it, but the well programmed and scheduled approach to training, as well as the light way in which the book is written, as well as pictures of each one of the recommended exercises, as well as the forum support which the author provides, as well as many other facts, make this book just great. I've been training according to it for about half a year now and I am totally satisfied with the results. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in training at home and have the body, as well as health, that he wants.

B002RI9SC4|1.0|This is without doubt the worst book I have ever read. I am usually quite easy to please when it comes to reading, because it is always an escape regardless of any problems within the book. This was awful. There is nothing I can really say in this review that hasn't already been said, so I will just repeat it. This is worse then fanfiction. Bella the Queen of the Mary Sue's was as painful as ever. Still the same whiny, complaining Mary Sue as ever before. It makes one wonder WHY people even like her. She is just awful. What does she see in Edward? And what ever does Edward see in her? It is beyond me. All I seem to be told is this pair have this amazing love to defeat all love. No love can compare with it. Reading of Bella's thoughts of Edward of loosing him was painful, hearing her marvel on his awesomeness was cringworthly. Everything about it.<br /><br />The Jacob POV? No. Just no. It was bad enough from Bella, but now I get to hear read Jacob saying over and over again how selfless Bella is? No. It was terrible. I won't even comment on the imprinting, because nothing will convince me it wasn't creepy and awful. Jacob himself in this novel was terrible. He used to be my favourite character, until apparently Meyer realised she has written herself a half decent character and decided to ruin him. Why does Jacob love Bella so pathetically? Because of the daughter she would have had? I don't buy that. That is just silly. That was just a stupid plotline to make everyone happy, to ensure everyone got their soulmate. Stupid. Stupid.<br /><br />Bella the Graceful Vampire. Of course, she would be perfect in everyway. She is now beautiful and loving in. After all, being plain old Human? How BORING. Now Bella gets to feel special by living forever, being beautiful, powerful and rich. Argh. There is this one moment in the book where Bella describes something to this point, and and I had to stop reading in fear I'd smash the iPad I was reading off.<br /><br />Why do people like these books? I really am sorry I can't figure it out. I was instructed if I read the books I'd understand better, and so I have. And no I do not understand why. They love each other? Wish I knew why. I don't see anything about Bella, or Edward for that matter that makes either of them so perfect for each other. Bella falls in love after barely speaking to him. Soulmate? Destined for each other? Yeah no. Generally people that love each other have to have things about each other they like. Bella just thought Edward was hot. Edward thought she would make a yummy dinner.<br /><br />I dread the movie. But at least it would have to improve on the book.y am sorry I can't figure it out.

B0015DYIH2|3.0|I'm one of those moms who was introduced to the Twilight series by one of her children and have since enjoyed this pseudo Victorian love story with a fantasy twist, and if you grew up reading Harlequin Romances, Twilight has a great feel to it.  I'm Team Edward, so I only skimmed the second book from Jacob's point of view.  While the book was an enjoyable read, several changes could have made it better.  The book is full of 'near sacrifices' and 'near tragedies', but not one of them was employed in a way which could have made the book more compelling.  Someone needed to be lost, or forced to leave the fold.  Edward or Bella needed to believe that a parent, sibling or friend would be sacrificed to really appreciate the importance of their relationship.  Jacob's imprinting on the baby is a little creepy (suddenly he becomes Woody Allen).  You never really believe that Bella is torn between Edward and Jacob, just that she feels guilty that she can't return his feelings.  What's the point of bringing the Volturi to Forks if all they're going to do is huff and puff and fly back to Italy?  I would also have liked to see more development between Edward and his adoptive parents.  The crux of his problem is that he can't reconcile his existence as a vampire and bringing Bella into that world.  At some point, I think there should have been a conversation between him and Carlisle, where he might actually thank him for the existence he's been given if it means he'll have Bella in his life. As the series continued, Bella had the least development, which left her character one dimensional.  Instead of becoming the oddly mature teenage girl with an almost fanatical focus for her future, she shows all the tunnel vision of a teenager who can't see the forest for the trees.  Trust me, I have a 17-year-old in my house and I see this dynamic everyday.  As a Victorian male, Edward was just what he should have been, although I know lots of people complain about him being a controlling stalker.  Viewed in the context of the 1920's as opposed to the 21st century, his overprotectiveness is endearing. I wouldn't mind seeing these changes in the upcoming movies, though I think it will be a struggle to get two compelling movies out of this last book.alker.

B004H88VUM|3.0|I heard some really rave reviews for this movie on Rottentomatoes.com and thought I would check it out on video. I've never cared much for Ben Affleck movies. I guess for Affleck this is a pretty good movie though. It seemed to me like he took the movie 'Heat' and 'The Departed', and rolled them into one. Only the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts.

B000001DV2|2.0|I watched the VH1 special \\"Ultimate albums\\" on pyromania a little while ago. In the interviews they talk about how music in 1983 was stale and people were looking for something new. Def Leppard took a chance with Pyromania and it paid off big time. When it came time to record their next album, they took their music in another direction with Hysteria. In the making of Hysteria special, they talk about how everyone was still remaking pyromania, and when Hysteria came out it was a shot in the arm. Taking a chance once again paid off for Leppard. That's the problem with Adrenalize. They remade their previous album and didn't try anything new. Music in 93 was changing and Def Leppard put out the same album they did in 1987. Maybe if they would have made a heavier album like Retro Active. Re-record some of those songs and making a rockin' album. Who knows. Adrenalize is just a cheesier, less good version of Hysteria, produced not to change music, but to make some money.
B0029LHX1W|5.0|Between 1978 and 1990, a Russian serial killer named Andrei Chikatilo roamed Russia killing women and children.  Chikatilo had at least 53 victims, although he retracted his confessions regarding a few of the victims.  Chikatilo was the inspiration for Tom Rob Smith's book, Child 44, which borrows heavily from the facts of the Chikitilo case.  However, Smith chose to place this first novel in his trilogy decades earlier.<br /><br />Pavel and Andrei are brothers trying to survive the Winter of 1933 in Russia.  It is a Winter of starvation that will only see ten members of their village survive until Spring.  The two brothers are separated while hunting in the woods.  Pavel disappears.  Andrei returns to his mother.  The two will cross paths again one day, but the reunion will be bittersweet.<br /><br />Leo is a Detective with the MGB.  He toes the Party line.  He believes he is doing work for the greater good.  His idealism might well be his downfall.  When the ambitions of fellow agents interfere with Leo's concept of reality he is forced to face reality.  This reality means choosing between life and death.  Leo follows his heart with consequences that might not only be deadly, but will definitely unveil the lie that he has been living.  Leo ends up a fugitive with his wife Raisa, attempting to solve a series of deadly child murders while evading arrest.  It is a race against time that keeps the pages of this book turning quickly.<br /><br />Tom Rob Smith does an excellent job in his debut novel.  But that is not merely my assessment.  This book must have caught the attention of Hollywood, because Ridley Scott had plans to release this book as a movie in 2010.  It is still pending production and is no longer listed on IMDB, so there may be issues getting this book to the screen.  If they ended fixing whatever glitches kept it from production in 2010, I will definitely head to the theater to see it.  It has all of the elements of a great thriller.  The unique setting, the inspiration from real events and the plot twists and turns provide the foundation for some great cinema.<br /><br />I picked up Child 44from the bargain bin at Borders.  I paid $3.99.  The book is available at Amazon.com for $2.50, which will probably put it up in the same price range with shipping.  I was surprised that a 2008 book that was written well enough to be considered by Hollywood would find itself in the bargain bin so quickly.  The book is well worth the money.  It is a story that is expertly woven with the elements timed precisely to keep the suspense and momentum moving forward.  It is an exceptional bargain that was probably driven by poor marketing.  This book is a find.<br /><br />Tom Rob Smith doesn't like tidy packages.  He doesn't strive for perfect relationships.  His characters aren't always pure.  There are motives.  People have motives.  And sometimes those motives are driven by survival.  Smith does an excellent job with character development, layering his characters carefully as the story progresses.  He allows the viewers in on a secret that is widely known.  You can't judge a book by the cover.  After creating a facade, Smith systematically pulls down the illusion, allowing his readers to see the ugly underbelly of human existence.  The writing was exceptional throughout with one minor exception.  Smith creates a child who is six-years-old that is the daughter of a central character.  The attributes that he assigns to this child did not seem to me to fit with the assigned age.  If I were converting this book to a screenplay, I would make the child nine or ten.  But that was my only reservation with the entire story, which was exceptionally well crafted.<br /><br />If you can find this book in the bargain bin of your local bookstore, pick it up.  Especially if you enjoy a good thriller.  The gripping pacing of this book will keep you flipping through the pages.  I got a cramp in my shoulder blade from staying in the same position toolong flipping pages.  I read this book cover-to-cover over the course of two days.  While the beginning felt a bit confusing, the elements came together nicely as the book progressed.  It is not a book that you jump right into, but once it grabs you, you won't be able to put it down.  The tempo escalates as you move forward through the pages.  An outstanding first novel.

0765326353|5.0|Title: The Way of Kings  This is the first book of the upcoming Stormlight Archive.  Author: Brandon Sanderson  Genre: Fantasy/SciFi    This book is the story of three main characters and there role in the world, all connected in some way. Along with Kaladin, Dalinar, and Shallan, we see a cast of supporting characters, as well as a few brief appearances by other minor characters.    Most important in my opinion is Kaladin. We follow his life throughout the book in both the present and the past, and therefore spend more time with him than the other characters. Kaladin, an amazing fighter and surgeon, just as he is beginning to make something of himself, finds his whole life shattered, and all of his hopes and dreams torn away from him as he abruptly drops to the bottom of the world's order. He finds himself at the bottom of the chain, a slave, but finds there is even worse to come with the life of a Brideman. In his new life he finds death around every corner, surrounding him, making him nearly yearn for it himself. But what he instead finds is not at all what he expected. In the lowliest station imaginable, he finds not hopelessness, but instead a second chance. A second chance at leadership, a second chance at succeeding, and most importantly, a second chance in his life to protect.    Along with this story line we also move, although quickly, through his life up to that point. Starting in Kaladin's childhood, and moving up months or years at a time throughout, we venture into the makings of himself as a person, and learn why he thinks and is the way he is. This gives us a rare and direct insight into the inner workings of one of the main characters, that would usually go unseen.    The next main character is Dalinar Kholin, a Highprince of Alethkar. Him as well as his son, are seen at the Shattered Plains, a rugged terrain where there 6 year old war with the Parshendi, a savage sect of the otherwise meek and tamed Parshmen that serve as property of most of the civilized world. Dalinar is plagued with visions of the past, and above all a cause to unite the Highprinces, for reasons far above him, that even he does not understand. In this book Dalinar is struggling with himself, his changing views of the world, and strained relationship with his son, and with his King. His story is one of truly finding himself and truly striving to do what needs to be done, no matter the cost.    Thirdly is Shallan. Shallan finds herself seeking the oppurtunity of a lifetime, to learn under one of the world's most renowned scholars, yet her true purpose is one much darker. Truly she seeks to steal a powerful item of great worth that is possessed by that scholar. Haunted by things in her past she has already done, she at first sees this as a simple task, after all, it seems it will be the only way to save her family's house after the death of her father, a secret her family desperately is trying to keep. As she becomes intoxicated by the things she is learning, and people she is meeting, it becomes something much more difficult to accomplish. In the end she has to make decisions that will decide much, life or death even.    Now there are a few characters as I've stated, that only appear once in the book, and are mainly there just to show a certain place or event. The last character of import, though with little screen time, is Szeth. Szeth is a Truthless, one bound to whatever master holds his oath stone. After assassinating a monarch, he is for a while cast aside, rotting in his guilt and haunted by his past deeds, bringing him to near insanity. He is happy at least to be of no more use than a slave, at least then he wasn't made to kill. His station changes however, and he is once again forced to do acts of unthinkable atrocity and cruelty, once again and still wanting nothing more than to die. His targets become much more important, until soon, the very fate of the world could be decided on whether or not he succeeds.    Ok I'd like to firstsay that I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and thought it was a great piece of literature. Brandon Sanderson definitely breaks away from many of his not much liked aspects of his writing style in this book, and definitely sounds much more experienced in his writing. One of the bigger complaints about Sanderson is that in much of his work, all the characters seem to be inherently good, and this too I think he is able to break away from in this book.  I thought the flow of the book was excellent. Sanderson arranges each section with certain characters and certain parts, and then places the minor characters in between sections in what he calls the `interludes'. I thought that this style of organization works well because it keeps the main characters and unnecessary characters separate, helping along the events of the plot, and keeping it flowing well, with breaks instead of slow parts.  During the beginning the only thing I didn't like about the storyline was Shallan's parts, which while interesting, I found a bit dry. I found this quality later redeemed for the most part, and also found it not that big of a deal, considering she was the least of the main characters. Overall I would rate this book a 9.5/10. I don't think I could give it a full 10, though it was very close. I definitely can't wait for the next book, and think this could be the next epic series of near Wheel of Time proportions.

If our interpretation differs from another person's, sometimes we will argue for or against a conclusion by pointing to specific bits of \\"internal evidence\\" or by saying some general premise is or isn't relevant to the case.<br /><br />But sometimes, of course, we can be totally wrong: some movies and stories just do NOT have any unified purpose.<br /><br />Sometimes their components are basically a bunch of things that are merely close to each other; they were pulled together by somebody who happened to think they all were \\"interesting,\\" like a little kid's collection of colorful clam shells and bottle caps.<br /><br />And just MAYBE that is all the unity this film has.<br /><br />Everyone watching THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS will be aware there is an alternating \\"double perspective\\" throughout most of it: there is (A) \\"the action of the present\\" (which slowly inches forward chronologically), involving an ineffectual reporter (Ewan McGregor) and a supposedly psychic so-called Jedi (George Clooney), and there is (B) \\"the action of the past\\" (shown in a large number of randomly sequenced flashbacks), involving the original so-called psychic Jedis (Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, etc.). Almost any viewer--after watching (A) and (B) zigzagging for more than an hour--would reasonably expect that this film would end with some meaningful link-up between (A) and (B).<br /><br />While I was watching this film, I recalled how gullible people were about New Age psychic phenomena during the '50s, '60s, and '70s and also how dozens of times during my own experiences in the U.S. Army (in the '60s) some wonderful new weapon or strategy would suddenly appear, be hyped by the command for a few months, and then suddenly drop out of sight. To me, as the film approached its end, it SEEMED to be a military-industrial-political satire--designed to show us how one more stupid idea (top-secret psychic warriors) had been funded by our government and then been turned into a big money-making scam by Kevin Spacey's unscrupulous character, who is working for one of the unscrupulous corporations that live off our country's huge \\"defense\\" budgets.<br /><br />And yet, on second thought . . . such an interpretation is undercut by the FUZZY FOCUS and LACK OF EMPHASIS the scam gets during the period when Kevin Spacey finally is in the present-time action--and then by the LACK OF AWARENESS the ineffectual reporter has about the scam when he writes and discusses his expos&eacute; story in the film's closing scene.<br /><br />Perhaps, therefore, it is relevant to mention one of the Bonus Features on the DVD that shows Peter Straughan, the author of the screenplay, telling HOW he went to work. He took (he says) Jon Ronson's book THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS and carefully marked all the weird passages that he wanted to be sure to include in the film--and THEN he tried to invent a new plot that would somehow string them together.<br /><br />As I said earlier, just MAYBE all the unity the episodes of this film have--is being lumped together like a kid's collection of bottle caps and clam shells.<br /><br />But even if this is so, most of the episodes really ARE very funny--and a few of them are very thought provoking.esigned to show us how one more stupid idea (top-secret psychic warriors) had been funded by our government and then been turned into a big money-making scam by Kevin Spacey's unscrupulous character, who is working for one of the unscrupulous corporations that live off our country's huge \\"defense\\" budgets.

B003TOS93O|5.0|there's no doubt in my mind that this show is just as good as the Live At Leeds album, however, my focus is on the remastering job. here, I'll explain... I have the original version of the Isle Of Wight 1970 CD set that came out on Sony/Legacy back in the late 90's. since I'm a stickler and a perfectionist when it comes to sound quality, my question is this... to the people that own this newer version: is it worth it for me to get the new 2010 remastered version of the 1970 Isle Of Wight CD's, considering that I already have the original one? is the sound quality that much better that it would be worth spending the money for it? your feedback on this would br greatly appreciated.
B003ITZBVS|1.0|This was the worst `cartoon' choice I ever made for a grandchild! My 4 YO grandson lives to see anything Batman.Batman is his hero. This is the darkest `cartoon' I've ever seen. I turned it off immediately when I realized what a poor choice I had made in purchasing this for an impressionable child. It has blood and gratuitous violence . It left my grandchild worried about the characters who were hurt (Altho I turned it off as soon as possible.) Definitely not for small kids or even Batman admirers. If I could have taken the one star I gave it off ,I would , but it didn't come off when I tried to remove it.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|I started watching Fringe weekly toward the end of the 2nd season and now am totally hooked by the great story, characters and overall coolness of the show. The show does have many gross out moments so it is not for everyone. This includes many dissections of people and slimy monster things.     Season 1 does start out a little slow due to the characters just starting to know each other and work with each other on cases. As the season goes along, it gets so much better and more interesting. In particular I really like the first appearance of the guy with no hair or eyebrows who takes notes on an alien designed I-touch type thing. This character and the people like him will get more involved in season 2 and 3.    I highly recommend new fans to get the first two seasons on DVD to better understand the roots of the show's origins. A lot of times the current show has flashbacks to the past first season 1 and 2. Now that I have seen them, I have a much deeper and better appreciation for the characters past, thinking and their style.   I hope Fringe can last many years. It is by far the best show on TV and well worth the time.
B0002O37RM|5.0|I received this as a gift.  I'm not a huge fan of jazz, but I played this CD for the first time yesterday, and I have listened to it a half-dozen times since.  It's absolutely wonderful!  I ordered the earlier CD \\"Nocture\\" by these same two about an hour ago.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|My family has watched SOM as a New Year's \\"ritual\\" for many years, first on VHS tape then on DVD...so we practically know the lines.  If you've always loved this film, and have a good display, you will not regret getting the Blu-ray release.  It is simply stunning, compared with the old DVD version.  You probably need to have a big screen to appreciate the amazing spatial resolution and truly luminous color, but if there were ever a film to make the case for Blu-ray, this is the one.  More importantly, technology truly serves the filmmaker's art in this release.

1439107955|5.0|Emperor is unique in my readings.  Covering everything about this dread disease from its history and economics to personal human struggles with the specific form of their disease and treatment. I am in treatment for cancer and it is a struggle for existence that can only be endured knowing the cost and suffering of not treating it.  I discovered the book from an interesting New Yorker book review.  I have not been disappointed that I purchased the book.  It is at once a reference and a story.
B00335EQ0E|4.0|I was first drawn to purchase the original cartoon version of Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland, after watching  Lewis Carroll's 1865 fantasy novel, \\"Alice in Wonderland, which featured the stars:  Mia Wasikowska, and Johnny Depp version in 2010.  It was an amazing piece of cinematography, directed by Tim Burton in both digitized computer animation through both IMAX 3D and Disney Digital 3-D, as well as in traditional theaters.  What amazed me while watching the whole re-introduction of this new Alice in Wonderland,  Mia Wasikowska plays the now nineteen-year-old Alice, who 13 years later returns for the first time as a young woman; I could not help but draw parallels to the original Disney presentation, way back in 1951.  In the original Disney film version of 1951, Alice becomes bored and her mind starts to wander. She sees a white rabbit who appears to be in a hurry. She chases it into its burrow and then a most bizarre series of adventures begins.  Kathryn Beaumont plays Alice, and Ed Wynn plays the Mad Hatter.  During the recording sessions, Ed Wynn ad libbed the speech where the Mad Hatter tries to \\"fix\\" the White Rabbit's watch. (\\"Muthtard? Leth not be thilly!\\") These comical scenes in the first movie made it quite memorable. The comical bits and animation, made an indelible impression on my mind as a child. Such as a fairy tale book come to life - you couldn't help but laugh at the bids, throughout the film.   Also, as a child growing up in the fifties, (yes, I am  baby boomer! ) Walt Disney, was one of the few forms of entertainment, where you could be entertained by real life animation, in full color ( the majority of TV was black and white in those days, before color TV became widely available.) meaning, it was as close to true-to-life cartoon action, you could ever deliver for the technology available in those days.   Part of the special features on disc2 are numerous short featurettes which Walt Disney himself narrated about the production and the storyboards that were carefully crafted and drawn throughout the film.  He shows how Disney studios went through the pain staking process of crafting the movie, in consideration of Lewis Carroll's original artwork in the book, and how Disney put his own personal techniques making the story more colorful and imaginative.  Also, he explained how Alice in Wonderland was one of  the first Disney films that included more musical productions than his earlier works, Snow White and Cinderella, with far most orchestra musical pieces and songs including a theme song, sung by Kathryn Beaumont herself.  It is easy to see how Walt Disney became such a mainstay of the American entertainment industry, it has certainly remained in my imagination all these years into adulthood. This video is definitely a classic and worth the purchase for the children in your life to enjoy.   Thanks, Bilal Hassan

Her life is full of pressure and a constant need to prove herself. When she gets a forced break from that world by being fired, Samantha (and the reader) is reminded of how life should be enjoyed and savored. Great book!    [...]
0061339202|5.0|This was one of the most interesting and inspiring books I've read, ever.  Granted it does start off very dry in the beginning but if you hang in there and follow the path the author is taking you, you will find that this book is a gem of brilliance.  Creating a life that has meaning is something that we can achieve - it doesn't just fall upon us - and that fact that anyone can do it by following what inspires them is wonderful.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to several friends and acquaintances - even people at cocktail parties - as one of the most insightful books ever.  Excellent!!

Gilberto's wife (who didn't speak any English) read the lyrics phonetically, and stole the show with her cool-distant-sounding monotone vocals.  A Great album that topped both the Pop & Jazz charts in 1964.  It grows on you.  If you were born in 1965, you may have been conceived to this music.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|In my experience, the quality of a serial goes down in subsequent seasons as the writers run out of new ideas. But, this fourth season of Dexter was the best among all seasons so far.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|This film kicks ass.  My only complaint is that it felt about 20 minutes too short with almost no character development, but I'm pretty sure that's the effect the filmmakers were going for.  They have said that the title of the film refers to the film's human characters as well as the titular extraterrestrials.  Whatevs...  There's tons of violence and a super hot Brazilian chick in it (but she keeps her clothes on.  boo!)  Anyway, a worthy sequel in the Predator franchise.  I can't wait until part 4.    PS.  Screw all you Predator 2 haters.  Y'all a buncha wack MCs.

I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble (have to press hard for it to register). No drops, no abuse. The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic. The keys feel hollow and light. The available functions are great. This is a classic calculator. But the functions are no good if the keys stop working...
B001F3FUK6|1.0|I have loved the Superman character and story ever since I can remember. I would watch the first two(LEGENDARY!) films every time I went to visit my grandmother's as she had them recorded on tape and we never had anything at home. I was SO excited when I heard this movie was coming but the level of my excitement was only exceeded by the disappointment I felt as I watched it...poor storyline(lots of repeats, unoriginal, cheap). This movie had great potential but was ruined by poor casting, rushing, poor writing, bad acting, misbudgeted. Trying to mesh the storyline of this movie with occurances from Superman I and II was a terrible idea, it made the characters very hard to believe. The original Superman movies made film history and will always be remembered whereas this movie will easily be forgotten just like everything else made nowadays. That's a fact. Brandon Routh or whatever his name is(didn't feel like he was worth remembering) does resemble a good superman in form but doesn't play the part. He just doesn't(dry? young personality...like...Super...BOY!) The choice of Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor? Enough said, give me a break! Doesn't work. Nope. No sir, try again. There are so many things wrong with this movie but either no one spoke up and said that's a bad idea or they were too lazy and cheap to change it and make it right. What a waste. I truly hope they can fix this if they make another one. Or find another director who'll stick up for the integrity of the film.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I really enjoy this movie.  It stayed true to the book but added some good scenes, especially at the beginning.    I'm used to getting movies from Amazon around the same time they are released in the stores, but I had to wait over a week before my came.

0439023521|3.0|I liked the first part of the first book well enough to order the second two so that I could go on reading without interruption. However, by the end of the book I had some regrets about placing the second order.    The book is a fast read (sort of like the Maximum Drive series) and was probably a fast write, too:  there's not a lot of depth. By the end of the book I felt somewhat surfeited and not too curious about the next book.  I'll review that too when I've had a chance to read it.
0316098337|3.0|The idea for this book was great...even the idea of telling the story from Jack's (5yrs old) POV was interesting...for the first couple of chapters. But after a couple of chapters, his childish POV became taxing for the reader to follow and I would often skip ahead to get to the meat of the plot. Wish we could have gotten in the mother's head more...
0307272702|5.0|I am a Board Certified  Lipidologist from the National Lipid Association.      I have been struggling for myself to maintain my weight loss of 80 pounds on the Jorge Cruise 3 hour diet.    Since June 2007, I hit a plateau and thought if I gained back some muscle mass, perhaps I could improve my metabolism which seemed to have come to a standstill.      I exercised one to three hours a day.  This last year I retired and hired two trainers and added water aerobics three times a week to my schedule.  I traveled a lot and thus did not do this everyday but while traveling I usually walked quite a bit.  I wanted to get the memory out of my muscles by doing the say exercise each day.      Despite the exercise and continuing to eat every 3 hours, I gained back 55 pounds in 3.5 years.  I went from 200 to 255 pounds.  Some might say I was successful and I still am 10% before my maximum.   I ate 2500 calories to 3000 calories a day.  I tried. to avoid the old carbs. I am still able to stay off insulin.    After reading the physiological reasons why insulin resistant (metabolic syndrome) patients will not utilize the fat in their fat cells for energy with high insulin levels, I am willing to try a low carb diet again.  <25 carbs a day.  I believe the desire to not go back on insulin will help me make the gustatory sacrifice of no carbs.  Maybe someday I can go up to 72 grams or 300 calories of carbs a day.    If you have the metabolic syndrome, I think it is very clear that a low carb diet is the way to go.      For myself, I found exercise and counting calories did not work once I was in post diet mode.  I refused to stay on a sub-starvation diet of 1850 calories a day for the resto of my life.      I may once again decide that life without carbs is not worth living.  But I have too much to live for, so I am hopeful.      PS You may want to look up my book: The Tubby Factor from Topeka.  The ideas are also on youtube.com at bedwards1951.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|I'm a big fan of zombies and thought this would be a riot. It is amusing, but is written like a user manual for putting a shelving unit together. I only got through about half of it because it was so repetitive. If you're looking for story format, definitely read World War Z. This book just didn't cut it for me.

0735619670|5.0|I have read a few dozen of the major works in the field of software engineering, and honestly nothing comes close to the pure wisdom transference of this book.  Over the course of six months, I became a much better developer and my company adopted better practices as a direct result of this book.  Works great for a company book discussion club.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I love all the songs on this cd expect the last one, NOT LIKE THE MOVIES. LAST FRIDAY NIGHT, FIREWORK, PEACOCK, E.T., HUNMMINGBIRD HEARTBEAT were my fav. Great cd with great music, horray!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|It takes a while for Matt Smith to find his Tardis legs as the 11th Doctor. But the story line is so compelling, so twisted and knotted, that you just have to see Matt perform. Karen Gillan is terrific throughout. New Doctor, new engenue, new associates, new story arc. Great like always.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|Despite what seems to be an almost universal panning, I liked this movie. I found Jonah Hex to be a decent hero and his ability to talk to the dead is a nice twist. I liked John Malkovich's bad guy and he plays it to the hilt. Though Megan Fox is still seems to be used for mostly eye candy, she has at least a bit of substance in this movie as Johan's girlfriend.<br /><br />Compared to some of the comic book adapted movies I've seen, I put this one a notch above, not because it follows the spirit or intent of the comic book, (which I've never read), but because it kept me interested all the way through. Sure, there are probably lots of holes in the plot, veered from the intent of the comic book, whatever, but none of that bothered me. It was worth the DVD rental. Recommended.
B002AR9YPI|5.0|This was certainly one of my favorite albums and it stands strong against some mighty hits like Broken Bells.     However this is not bubblegum pop and the tunes are harmonious and haunting but take a little while before they are grow on you. The music is complex and the melodies are certainly worth a listen and then some.
B00000EV0S|4.0|This is not the first death metal album I've ever owned, but it is a foundation. Everything is there. The monotone Cookie Monster vocals, the intricate guitar riffing, and the double blast beats. In this case, it's all put together in an excellent package of songs.<br /><br />Similar in a way to Bolt Thrower, I can actually understand most of the lyrics if I listen close. Not that it matters much, but I suppose the lyrics are par for the genre. Death, destruction, corpses and the like. Doesn't matter. I am more interested in the whole sound palette and Leprosy succeeds in keeping my interest. I have played this album many times on the cassette version that I have. I just transferred it to CD and though there are several bad spots in the tape, especially in the song Leprosy, it is still intact enough to bring the music through.<br /><br />To me, there is no standout track. They are all good in their own way and what makes them the most interesting to me is the great guitar work. Each song has its shining moment.<br /><br />If you are a fan of classic death metal, I highly recommend this.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|Alter Bridge consists of the 3 instrumental members of Creed teamed up with the very talented vocalist / guitarist Myles Kennedy.  On this, the band's second album, they show a bit more focused approach than on the debut.  There are plenty of loud crunching guitars to be found here, but also an emphasis on softer more acoustic material in some spots.  Kennedy is one of the top vocalists in rock at the moment and his voice soars over the material bringing much of it to a higher level.   This album is hard hitting and I am not sure if I like it better than the band's debut, but it certainly continues to forge a path away from the old Creed sound.  There are lots of tasty guitar solos and the rhythm section is on fire throughout the disc.  The songs themselves could use a bit more diversity here and there, but overall they are a fine collection.  My personal highlights are the opening track the rocking \\"Ties That Bind\\" and the seven minute plus title track \\"Blackbird\\".  Alter Bridge continue to be a cut above the average heavy rock bands out there and there is a reason why Myles Kennedy was the top candidate to replace Robert Plant in Led Zeppelin last year.  Bottom line this is a great modern hard rock / metal record.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|So far, I've liked all of Night's movies so I went into this one expecting some of his trademarks. The plot twist at the end was the big Kahuna, and in this movie, it was there, but I'm sure there were plenty of people who had it all figured from the opening scene. I didn't because I don't try to look that far ahead. I'd rather have the story carry me there. In this case, I was at first surprised, but not shocked after I thought about it. I don't know if that's a bad thing, but it was nothing like the surprises of his earlier work. Maybe because there is expected to be a plot twist, no matter what he does, it is no longer a surprise.<br /><br />The movie has a decent if unknown cast and takes place in Night's hometown of Philadelphia. I'm guessing the building used doesn't really exist, but either way, the structure looked good.<br /><br />For anyone with a phobia about being trapped in an elevator, this takes things to the next level with the uninvited guest. During the whole movie, I tried to figure out which character is the real bad guy. From every one of the elevator passengers to the cop to the Hispanic security guard (who I think was narrating the story), they were all suspect. There were plenty of red herrings thrown in to keep things interesting and when we finally find out who the real bad guy is, I was at least a bit surprised, though my wife wasn't. The other twist was with the cop but I don't want to spoil that for anyone else, despite what others may have said in their reviews.<br /><br />The film didn't get too excessively bloody or gory, and most of that was implied more than shown graphically. In this case, it worked just fine.<br /><br />I do not regret spending the money on this rental. Recommended for thriller/horror fans.
1400052173|5.0|I read this book in a little under 8 hours. I couldn't put it down. I was enthralled by Henrietta's story, and was left wanting to know more about the black community during the Jim Crow era. I was torn apart by what happened to the Lackses, knowing that if they had been given even .01% of the money from their mother's cells, they would have had a chance. And I was stunned that I actually understood most of the \\"science\\" behind cell culture. Ms. Skloot does an excellent job covering the history of cell culture and why we should care about it. I just wish there had been more to read!
0385342047|2.0|I am a Sophie Kinsella/ Madelene Wickham fan, but I must confess that I did not love this book at all. First of all I can not stand spoiled children so Minnie really annoyed me and I couldn't stand the fact that she only knew two word sentences and most of them started with \\"mine\\".  Also I was expecting to find out that Becky had matured a little bit (being a mom and all) but her character felt even worse than before, if that is possible. The interaction with the first nanny and the whole \\"carrot\\" incident was really annoying to me and when I was reading the part about the moving I felt like screaming at the book...so irritating!  I only finished it because I wanted to start another one and I felt that at the end it was a little better and easier to read for me.  If you are a Kinsella fan I would say \\"go ahead and borrow it from the library\\" but do not waste your money. I would like to keep on reading her stories but I wouldn't mind if she never writes about Becky again.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Let me start off by saying one thing: this book is great.     When I first started reading this book I thought this was the worst book ever because I had no idea what was going on. Then I realized this is EXACTLY what Dashner wanted, for the reader to feel as Thomas did when he first woke up. Throughout the rest of the book, the reader goes through the story with Thomas. The twists are just as suprising to the reader as they are to Thomas. This is a GREAT plot, and the characters are one of a kind.    If you are looking to get sucked into a twisted world that stretches your imagination (in a good way), then this is the book for you!
B003XM70B4|5.0|From beginning to end, The Goonies keeps your eyes glued to the screen!  It is the perfect film for all ages and watching it again after almost 20 years brought back many great memories from my childhood!  Watch it alone or watch it with your family, you will love it again and again!
B000B5Y00U|4.0|La Traviata     Violetta Valéry - Montserrat Caballé  Alfredo Germont - Carlo Bergonzi  Giorgio Germont - Sherrill Milnes  Conductor - Georges Prêtre  RCA Italiana Opera Orchestra and Chorus     (Recorded June 1967)     This is an uncut performance of the opera. Included are Alfredo's aria 'O Mio Rimorso' (both verses) and Giorgio's 'No, Non Udrai Rimproveri'.     Montserrat Caballé may not have the coloratura technique of other soprani such as Callas or Sutherland who are both famous in the role, but her portrayal is convincing. Her delicate voice and sweet timbre fit the role very well and allow her to convincingly play the role of a sick, dying woman (unlike some more lush, fuller voiced soprani). Her impeccable control of dynamics are displayed throughout, frequently showing off her pianissimi, for which she is famous. Her 'Ah, fors'è lui' and 'Addio del passato' are both beautifully sung and deserve special mention.     Carlo Bergonzi's Alfredo is one of the major highlights of this recording. Some of his top notes may not be idealy placed and as a result they are sometimes pushed and slightly below pitch, but with his exemplary legato and attractive timbre, combined with the ability to phrase lines with such beauty and style make Bergonzi's Alfredo hard to match. Most impressive is his 'O Mio Rimorso', his work in the duet 'Parigi O Cara' and the final scene; which is particularly moving.     Sherrill Milnes sings a fine Giorgio Germont that is hard to fault. Though I do not feel the combination of Milnes and Bergonzi to be ideal. I feel that Giorgio Germont should sound as though he is actually older than his son Alfredo. I find that the combination of these two singers does not vocally show the age difference that there should be.     Georges Prêtre's choice of tempi is occasionally irritating. The 'Brindisi' in the first act is taken rather slowly. That said, Prêtre seems to be rather accommodating of the singer's needs and allows them to show off their talents.     This Traviata may not be the most intense reading of the score. It IS what I would refer to as a \\"pretty recording\\" (as opposed to for example, the Callas, di Stefano, Bastianini, Guilini recording of 1955 or the Albanese, Peerce, Merrill and Toscanini recording of 1946; both of which I would call \\"dramatic\\"), though that is not to say that this performance is not dramatically credible. I find myself going back to listen to this recording more than many others.     BY MITCHELL BOLDING
1439177783|5.0|I picked up \\"Unbearable Lightness\\" after reading a few lines in Target and didn't put it down until I was finished a day later. The book was extremely intelligent and honest. I read a lot--everything from Dickens and Shakespeare to popular authors like Stieg Larsson.  And this was the most compulsively readable book I've had in a long time. I didn't want it to end (although, of course, I'm glad she's in recovery).<br /><br />This book changed my perception of Hollywood and television. There are so many actresses and models who seem to be \\"naturally\\" 100 pounds. I knew it was kind of B.S., but now I REALLY know it's B.S. For me, Portia blew the lid off that one.<br /><br />I thought it was really, really powerful and something I'd never seen before to put the blood test results opposite the pictures of a skeletal Portia. Without realizing it, people can glamorize eating disorders and there was nothing glamorous about Portia's account.<br /><br />Portia's relationship with Ellen seems really sweet and touching. And I love that Portia came to the approach to eating that she did--it reminded me of \\"Women, Food, and God\\".<br /><br />While I've never had a clinical eating disorder, I've been entertaining some sort of restriction since I can remember. Disordered eating can be on a spectrum, but all part of the same distraction from pain and need for control and perfection. If you're interested in explorting that more, check out \\"Women, Food, and God\\".
1439107955|5.0|The Emperor of all Maladies  is a classic in the field of medical history. SM writes like a seasoned author similar to Nuland, Selzter or Roy Porter. I am surprised that this book is his first for the general public. As a physician myself I have  limited understanding of the complex genetic pathways responsible for the development of cancer. Dr. Mukherjee was able to explain the sequences without overwhelming the reader and  to find a progressive sequence of diagnostic and therapeutic events leading to the understanding of this disease across a period of 200 years. The book is a objective summary of cancer \\"state of the art\\" showing the major advances in the treatment of some types (leukemias, lymphomas and breast cancer )and minimal progress in relation to others (pancreas, stomach, lung). His enthusiasm for his specialty (Oncology) is contagious. I strongly recommend this book to all of us that respect and fear the \\"Emperor of All Maladies\\"    Daniel Sette Camara, MD, FACP,FACG,FASGE
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Really cool.... just awesome. I'm not a big Star Trek fan but my step dad is. The quality was really good, it pins on so it won't come off. I bought the whole set for him for xmas and he really like them. They are about 2.5 inches from top to bottom and they weren't too heavy or anything.
B002MAQSJ8|5.0|This book is thoroughly and dramatically written, presenting a turning-point in business history in a quick 500+ page read. Barbarians at the Gate provides remarkable insight to the greed that was/is rampant on Wall Street, the egos surrounding the LBO era, and names that are still relevant in finance.    As a finance professional, I would put this book in the canon of business books. Although the book at times reads more like a dramatic novel than a financial history, I'd recommend this book to anyone beginning a career in finance who has aspirations of high-level banking, sales, or trading.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Love this show, was really cool to watch it over again on Blu-Ray with a HD TV, the special features are kinda fun with Lafayette talking and stuff, but only if you've already watched the series.
B0039PPW60|4.0|This is a good mixer. I chose this because I was hoping the USB connection would transfer audio between the PC and the mixer without the noise that is usually present when using the PC's line out and mic jacks. Although challenging to get the USB audio to work, it does work and is noise free. If you get this, don't even install the drivers on the CD, and instead go straight to the Behringer website and find the latest drivers because the one on the CD in my package was pre-windows 7. Also, there is a little red button above the \\"phone/ctrl room\\" volume knob that must be in the \\"out\\" or \\"up\\" position else audio won't go from the mixer to the PC for recording.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars instead of five not because of the issues getting USB audio to work, but because once you do there seems to be some missing functionality. There are no mixer controls available on the USB audio channel. Every other channel, you have all the mixing controls and functions, but on the USB audio channel, there is nothing. It is straight audio and you can't do anything with it. If you want to get control over the audio from the PC, you have to revert to taking audio out from the line out jack and into one of the mixing channels, which then introduces the noise that is typical when interfacing in this manner.<br /><br />It is a shame they don't treat the USB channels as any other audio channel and give you full control over those channels to shape the sound as you desire.
0393061310|4.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel is an excellent book with pros being that concepts are easy to understand, many examples that the concepts are applied in, and ultimately the ideas make sense while the cons being just repetitive and tedious at times.     Most of the ideas and concepts that Jared Diamond introduces and explains is easy to follow. Jared Diamond first proposes questions of why things happened in history and then goes about answering it in, on average, twenty page chapters that introduce different ideas and patterns with explanations. He then ties these ideas and trends into a logical way that helps answer the question posed at the beginning of each chapter. If you are not an expert or have extensive knowledge in these fields, then expect to find this book very enlightening and agree with most of Jared Diamond's ideas.    The next positive thing about this book is that it has an abundance of examples to look at. The purpose for the examples that Jared Diamond includes after each concept introduced is to further convince the reader that his views are correct by aiding the reader's learning in the new concept introduced by seeing it in action. But as I read further into the book I started to question whether his concepts are universal or only applied to the examples given, which can lead to some controversy. But nonetheless, the examples given was key to convince people to believe his ideas.    An important good thing about this book is that the ideas introduced in this book are believable and makes sense to most readers. This connection with the reader is the most important thing that the author can do. In this book, basic concepts are introduced and progress throughout the first half or so of the book. Understanding the basic concepts, such as the roles of food production, domestication, and geographic location in affecting human society's development that are introduced in this book, helps the reader understand the book as a whole along with the main idea of thebook which is Diamond's thesis that peoples on different continents histories are different because of environmental factors.     The only negative thing that I am able to say about this book is that at some points in the book the reading becomes repetitive. Many basic ideas of the book are repeated many times in this book which makes it hard to read sometimes because it feels like you are wasting your time. One repetitive thing that comes to mind is the idea that food production allowed specialization and all that other good stuff that allowed the formation of a complex society. But despite the tedious parts of the book, Guns, Germs, and Steel offers a load of interesting stuff. I am sure that there are other negative stuff about this book, but that would require that I be an expert in these fields to validate the information that the book provides.    In conclusion, Guns, Germs, and Steel is certainly an excellent read that brings many new perspectives and ideas that one might have never though of before if you are not an expert in these kind of fields. Although I would rather not read this book again, I definitely recommend this book to any person out there that is learning about world history.

B00009YOQW|3.0|This drum has a great sound, is cute and is more or less well constructed. I was disappointed, however, to see that the joints in the wood on the side of the drum were splitting apart when I took it out of the box.  It was as if the drum was constructed with wet wood that shrunk after the drum was assembled, leaving 1-2mm gaps.  The gaps in the wood are purely cosmetic though, because the sound is fine and the drum seems to be strong.  The rubber tipped mallet optimizes the tone of the drum.  My toddler really enjoys playing with it.  She was really excited to hear the three different tones that she could produce on the same drum.

0316098337|3.0|I almost gave up on this book within the first few pages, but I'm glad I stuck it out.  The book is written from the perspective of a 5 year-old who has never been outside of the room he was born in.  The writing is childish, in the boy's perspective, but also intriguing.
B0032Y8XH8|2.0|A friend of mine told me about this album because I had turned him onto Fleet Foxes way before they had became popular.  I was a little shocked that Sigh No More was not only bad, but awesomely bad at that.  Now, normally I would never review an album by an artist that I don't like, especially if it's a genre of music that's not my thing.  (I'll leave jazz, classical, metal and top 40 pop to the aficionados.)    But these guys are being placed in a category and compared to a lot of artists I really like and listen to a lot.  The lyrics, the songs, the simplistic yet bombastic choruses leave me totally cold.  That they are Brits makes me want to say they are fakes jumping on a trend that has already moved on in the alternative music world anyway.  But I won't say that because maybe their hearts are in the American west and they really do aspire for West London to be some kind of OK Corral or something.    That said, they can play their instruments and sing nice harmonies, so props for that.  Given the positive reviews here and in some music mags, perhaps it's best to leave it as a matter of personal taste. (Though not all the press is enamored with Mumford, read Pitchforks review if you think the naysayers here are crazy.)    Looking at Amazon's \\"Customers who bought this item also bought\\" list I can see fans of Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, Ray LaMontagne, Phoenix, Vampire Weekend, The XX and some others liking Mumford.  Not because the styles are necessarily similar, but there's a mainstream pop sensibility to those bands that might allow you to appreciate these guys.    But if you're a fan of Fleet Foxes, Deerhunter, Beach House, Grizzly Bear, Michael Hurley, Girls, The Black Keys, Joanna Newsom, Cat Power, Devil Makes Three etc, if you're a fan of any of these bands, hopefully you've got better taste than this dreck...
B003L77TZI|5.0|Mrs. Perry-Brand has made my jaw drop for a 2nd time over two albums.  I will not waste your time on review-ish rhetoric, I will just say that:<br /><br />First, get rid of the track 'Peacock.'  Why do these kinds of tracks make the final album cut?  If you love that song, forgive me.  Ignore me, even.<br /><br />There is no \\"Second,\\" I guess - the rest of the album is endearing and invigorating and five-star, which is a rare rating for me to give.  She has given us all the radio plays that are swamping your FM station, AND she has given us tracks that awe me and yet will never be heard on the radio.  FANTASTIC!<br /><br />I am partial to the track 'E.T.'... this is Katy for me.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|George Clooney is one stressed-out assassin. He winces a lot, rubs his eyes, wears a pained expression. He drives alone at night, moody. He walks through dark and deserted streets, moody. There's a lot of moodiness in the air.  Slow-paced films like *The American* disdain sensationalism. They're slow because they want to engage viewers psychologically. You're not supposed to doze off, you're supposed to be thinking about the moral significance of the hit man's actions: Will he defy his handler, protect the girl, get out of this dehumanizing racket?  In one scene, Clooney has grown suspicious of the gold-hearted hooker he has befriended (the stunning Violante Placido). Must be all the stress. So he takes another drive, enters yet another phone booth, calls his spymaster and argues with him, broods in yet another cafe over yet another cup of espresso.  Padding events like this has a purpose if the events raise questions that require time for rumination. But the dilemmas raised by *The American* aren't complex.  Should he get out? Yes. Should he build meaningful relationships and stop being so aloof all the time? Yes. Are the bad guys bad? Well, they're not very good: Director Anton Corbijn fumbles the film's only two action sequences with eye-rolling implausibility.  To be fair, Corbijn often succeeds in creating tension. There's a startling opening sequence in snow-blanketed Sweden. When Clooney drops off the high-powered rifle he has fashioned, you can feel the danger he's in. And in a minimal-dialogue movie that needs a good soundtrack to prop up sagging interest, Herbert Gronemeyer delivers a gloomy, minimalist score full of groaning cellos and blips of electronica.  *The American* also has its location going for it: the hillside town of Castel del Monte (only 400 real-life residents, preserved in a national park, looking much as it did during the Renaissance). Those winding stone stairways make for great chase scenes. They're like a labyrinth. That's it! Clooney's caught in a maze, he doesn't know how to get out, the layout of the town is a metaphor for his quandary. Let's be sure to emphasize that. Let's emphasize that many, many times.
B0000035E7|5.0|this is an album for anyone who is a fan of grunge noise rock punk or anything like that it how ever is not a good choice for casual nirvana fans that only like nevermind or greatest hits so if your a casual fan and you want this cd than get the original version used or something however if your a big nirvana or grunge fan and cant get enough of nirvana than this along with sliver and incesticide is something you should get or the boxset if youve got alot of cash to cough up
0307595579|2.0|I love the Millennium Trilogy of books which is why I chose to purchase this box set despite owning all three books already in UK/International paperback publications. Unfortunately the manufacturer's packaging on this set is severely deficient. I received 2 copies of this from Amazon, the decorative boxes for both copies were ruined by the manufacturer's packaging techniques. The decorative box is oversized for the books (about 1/8-1/4 inch wider inside than the book covers) and the manufacturer shrink-wraps the books into the box, crushing the corners of the box where they are pulled in against empty space. Simply removing the shrink wrap from one of sets revealed several tears in the box, including a 2-3\\" long tear on the top left corner. Both sets (the original purchase and the replacement Amazon sent when I reported the damage) are on their way back to Amazon and I will be waiting for them to resolve this issue, as the sets in my local bookstores (Amazon, Barnes & Noble) do not seem to have this problem. I would advise holding off on purchasing this set until Amazon can sort out their problems with the publisher's packing methods.
0307711773|5.0|We listened to this book on our Holiday vacation and the entire family really enjoyed it.

0545265355|1.0|OMG!!  Over 60 years old and I just wasted several of my few remaining precious hours reading this dribble.    I never liked science fiction and this book only reinforced my dislike of it.    The character development was weak; the characters were undeveloped; the dialogues were trite; and the plot was tata!    However, I did learn that Suzanne Collins is on my \\"do not read\\" list.
0312360258|1.0|This book is simply bad. To say the writing is juvenile would be an understatement -- I wouldn't have been surprised to see the use of emoticons. The writers clearly assume their readers are stupid, as demonstrated by the constant parenthetical asides that either explain a joke that was just made or point out why a comment was significant when anyone with a half a brain could have figured it out on their own.<br /><br />Not only is it just plain bad, it's also offensive. Just over 50 pages in, the narrator describes how she \\"felt like a total retard.\\" Language like this is never appropriate but is especially irresponsible in a book aimed at young readers. Later on, the writers describe a boy's hair as \\"nappy,\\" which I'm pretty sure is also considered offensive. And while they go out of their way to have their protagonist explain her liberal point of view regarding homosexuality, they also imply, and flat-out state, many times that girls who engage in sexual activity are \\"sluts.\\" And not that we needed this mother-daughter duo's opinion on the matter, but one scene near the beginning of the book that describes a situation of almost-oral sex taking place is referred to over and over again as \\"disgusting.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, if you're looking for a well-written, thoughtful, interesting, fun, and original book, Marked is not it.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Awesome collection. This contains everything that is available for this series (save for a few webisodes, which I have seen and they suck anyways) in obviously the highest quality you can get. Basically if you're a fan of BSG and want Blu-ray, this is the only way to go, hands down.

B000LW7N6G|5.0|Based on a true story, Frank Serpico, beautifully portrayed by Al Pacino (better than he was in his Academy Award winning performance in \\"Scent of a Woman\\"), is an honest, ethical police officer.  But he is unable to ply his trade because he is surrounded by greedy colleagues who are forever \\"on the take.\\"  The corruption is epidemic and rises among the highest ranked in the Department.  It is a frustrating experience and gnaws at the guts of any decent, honest citizen to learn that the people who enforce our laws are of such low moral character.
B000002A46|3.0|I like more contempory Christmas music.
B002VECMAE|5.0|I have wanted to see this movie since the trailers were playing on TV, but once it came out on DVD, everyone said it was boring, or didn't have good story, etc.     Well, my husband and I watched it last night, and we loved it. It's not screaming with laughter funny, or a joke a minute funny, it's just relaxed satire. The whole movie is hilarious because the subject material is ridiculous (and true, which is also humorous). The storyline flows lazily along, explaining the story with flashbacks.     The ONLY complaint that I had about this movie, which I won't deduct stars for because I know the filmmakers have nothing to do with making them, is that all of the hysterical parts were shown in the trailers. The rest of the movie will put a smile on your face, but the knee slapping LOL moments were all revealed to me beforehand. Which sucked.     Have a glass of wine and watch it, if it helps. We enjoyed it without wine, but all the negative reviews makes me think some people might need it ;)
6305922756|5.0|This movie must be watched more than once to really understand it but it is definitely the finest ficticious rockumentary I have ever seen.  Rob Reiner plays his part straight and the outcome is hilarious.  To understand the comment about the \\"11 stars\\"  you have to watch the scene where Nigel explains to Rob why their music is louder than anyone else's (their claim to fame is that they are the loudest rock band there is.<br />\\"How do you get the music so loud?\\"<br />\\"It's because we have these special amplieiers.  Most of them stop at 10 but ours go up to 11.\\"<br />\\"How do you know that your \\"11\\" isn't the same as someone else's \\"10\\"?\\"<br />\\"Because it's ELEVEN!\\"
B004EI3ON4|4.0|As an audiophile I am extremely critical and discerning when it comes to recording. Since switching to KS Audio that has even more-so turned into a quest for the perfect recordings. I hear every tiny little speck and mistake that was made down to the minute white noise during the master recording process. Other than that I love the music and highly recommend it. Buy it and enjoy it. Well worth the money. If you are audio expert... you'll still enjoy it.
0385341008|5.0|I'll admit that the style of letters in the very beginning made my brain hurt. I thought there was no way I would ever keep all the characters writing back and forth to one another straight, especially seeing as they seemed to jump right in without much warning or explanation.<br /><br />But before I knew it I was hooked. A wildly fast read, but so utterly lovely. This book is truly about characters; the caring and adorable heroine, the cast of crazy and unusual islanders, the dramatic suitor, lovable child, and intriguing Elizabeth. Something about learning of their lives via letters enables you to feel as if you know them in a deeper way than most narratives which I really enjoyed.<br /><br />By the end of the book I wanted not only to visit the island of Guernsey but meet the cast of characters from this sweet book. A great vacation read.
0393072231|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The Author takes a difficult subject matter and breaks it down in as clear a fashion as possible. Even though I knew the outcome, I had a hard time putting it down. A well done book. As readable as a book on this subject could be.
B003UYV08E|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew for Christmas and it was just what he asked for.  He loved the movie in the theater and wanted to add it to his personal movie collection.  Great movie....lost of action.  Great delivery.
0817439390|4.0|I recommend this for anyone who isn't an experience photographer, or anyone who doesn't regularly shoot in manual or semi-automatic (eg, Av/Tv on a Canon).  I have bought it for a lot of friends who are generally good \\"snapshot\\" photographers (in other words, they are very good at picking out subject matter and composition) but constantly miss out on great photos because of a lack of understanding of how to use lighting to their advantage.  The writing style is good and engaging and the whole work can be taken in pretty quickly.  The videos are a nice addition as well.    My only complaint is that the editing seems a bit sloppy.  There were a few places where the explanations of settings that accompanied photos were either unclear (or perhaps incorrect) which is problematic if you're trying to study what the author did to make the shot.  Another error is in the section regarding graduated neutral density filters: he discusses the soft- and hard-edge varieties, and says that he prefers \\"soft-edge.\\"  But in the accompanying video he says the opposite (I may have that backwards, but it was not consistent).  Well, which is it, and why?  The section on HDR, while not really essential to the book and a sort of bonus, was quite unclear.      Ultimately, none of this take away much from the helpful nature of the book (and perhaps has been fixed in a second printing already).  Buy one for yourself and extra copies for your friends.

B003L77G38|5.0|I am not generally one to gush over a television show, but Fringe deserves it. It makes you think, it is entertaining, contains awesome acting, and keeps you watching. What more can you ask for? I have little confidence in FOX, and fear they will cancel the show. I certainly hope they instead focus on advertising the series. Sci-Fi shows always struggle to gain viewers. This is not your ordinary sci-fi. Anna Torv is not only beautiful, but very talented, as is Joshua Jackson. The real treat though is John Noble. You just can't wait to hear what he will say next. Funny, witty, perceptive, and very warm. Not bad for a mad scientist, right? The depth of his character is rarely seen on television. He alone is worth the price of the set.
0394818237|5.0|Richard Scarry, aside form being a masterful, playful illustrator, has a knack for explaining things in a visual way.   Three examples of favorite stories in this book that you may really like too:    * The ocean liner with all its cabins, cranes, steering, rudder-controls, and storage holds. The whole thing is drawn as a cut-through so we can see all the goings-on inside. The flowers delivered to mom's cabin. The boo-boo cared for in the sick room. The humor everywhere.    * Building a house: The little boy Huckle, when he's missing playmates,  watches the empty lot next door turn into a place of excavation machines digging, then waterlines, sewer pipes, walls are built, wires, floors, heating system, roof and 11 different phones installed ... a house is taking shape before his eyes (and ours). After the last painter is done, and paid, a quadruple-decker bus pulls up with a BIG family of playmates for Huckle.     * Another favorite: Forestry: from seeding and saplings to logging, floating logs on the river, carpentry and papermaking... and oh, all those delicious and intricate gears and levers that transfer the power of the water wheel to all the chipping, hauling and sawing machines inside the saw mill! Follow the little arrows, and see which wheel turns which way!     My young curious lego-builder has loved this book since age 3 or 4, and still does.   This book fascinates and charms with it's subtle humor and cleverly drawn explanations of everyday life.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I bought Contra first and loved it.  While their debut isn't as magical as their sophmore album, this self-titled effort has a fine round of perfect songs.  \\"Oxford Comma\\" offers the best guitar solo I've heard in years,  \\"A-Punk\\" never ever ever gets old, and \\"Blake's Got a New Face\\" is my favorite VW track of all time.  There are a few songs I don't entirely love on this album, but everything here is good.  While I don't see it as well-rounded as Contra, this cd strongly defines their sound and offers a great 11 track listening.<br /><br />Hopefully they just get better and better.  After buying their first two cd's I can definitely say that they are a top 5 band.  This is where great new music is going, and Vampire Weekend's happy/rich/bubbly sound is ahead of the curve.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Considering all the problems Robert Downey, Jr. had a few years ago with the law and various drug scrapes,  I was shocked when he was chosen to play Iron Man.  However he nailed that role beautifully.  I was shocked even more when he was later hired to play Sherlock Holmes.  However he is terrific here as well.  Lets face it, this is no Jeremy Brett or Basil Rathbone.  Holmes is young, athletic and able to mix it up with the best of them.  Jude Law is a different Watson than we have ever seen as well, he is also inclined to shoot first or get involved in fisticups and ask questions later.  One of today's prettiest and charismatic young actresses, Rachel McAdams, is a pleasure to watch as Irene Adler and after this film and \\"Robin Hood,\\" Mark Strong is the ultimate British villain.  The plot is totally wild and often incomprehensible.  The action scenes are great and there is an even Oddjob-like villain's stooge to throw Holmes and Watson around in several very well-staged action scenes.  The sets and production values are lavish and wonderful to look at, the money this film cost is all up there on the screen. The music by Hans Zimmer also adds to the excitement and is fascinating to listen to.  The picture and sound on the blu-ray are fine.  There are several special features on the making of this film, however they are much shorter than the special features I've seen on many other blu-ray films.  As stated previously, this is a triumph for Downey Jr.  It is a wild and exciting adventure and if you are a Holmes purist, there is a good chance that you are not going to like it.  I've been a Holmes fan for many years.  I enjoyed this film greatly in the movies and on blu-ray.  And I can't wait for the next one, which I believe they are filming right now.
B000QJM8Z0|1.0|I love Bridget Jones Diary and have read it several times.  Beware, however, the editing of this book for the Kindle edition was unaccptable - the font changed randomly a few times during the book, a few lines of text were missing completely, and a weird random image of a book cover kept popping up at the most random times throughout the text.  I ended up calling customer service and demanding my money back.  Buy the book, not the kindle edition, if you want an enjoyable reading experience.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Once again rick manages to blend greek mythology with a very modern outlook on it.As also in his other great books he is a elexcent writer and i cannot wait until the spring for the sequal.If  you enjoyed this book you will also love the rangers apprentice series.All in all i give  this book a virtual round of applause &#34;clap&#34; &#34;clap&#34; &#34;clap&#34;
0307454541|4.0|It took me about 40 pages to get into the book, but once I did, I couldn't put it down!!! The author has a way of writing that hooks the reader. The last 80 or so pages were a struggle for me to read as it dealt mostly with the first 40 pages, but in all a really good book!
B001C46P2K|5.0|Got this for my wife for Christmas because we both loved it in the theater. Great HD quality and well worth the purchase for fans of this genre.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|It's different and some will love and some will despise. I would say that there is no middle ground with this one, but I would probably be wrong. My wife and I watched this with another couple and I loved it, the other guy liked it, his girl made fun of it, but kept watching and my wife hated it so much she made nasty comments throughout about how stupid it was and eventually went to sleep. I was glad when she finally did because she was annoying me to the point I was about to turn her into coins just like in the movie.<br /><br />One way or the other, you have to admire the incredible visuals, colors, visions and creativity that knows what it is and doesn't try to please those who will hate. The creators knew that they were making a polorizing movie that some would hate and think was stupid, but they also knew what they wanted to do and they did it with full zesto.<br /><br />SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD is a throwback to an era of videogaming that only those who know it will get it, or appreciate it. As the movie zips and zaps back and forth with creative visuals that have rooms rippling and bouncing as rock music tests the boundaries of speakers and characters fly through the air as if they were living a real life game of MORTAL KOMBAT, it doesn't take us long to realize we are seeing something we've never seen before.<br /><br />The sound throughout the movie is like your walking through a booming claustrophobic arcade room with pinball games bouncing balls off of double score targets, Mario brothers, Pac-Man, Mortal Kombat & slot machines. In fact, SCOTT PILGRIM most likely won't be, but it should be up for SOUND & VISUAL oscars this year.<br /><br />In the middle of all the creative visuals and videogame throwback throughout the film, SCOTT PILGRIM manages to put together an insanely interesting romance story between Scott's vision of dreamy beauty Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), himself and Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), who is still in high school and is out of her mind obsessed with everything PILGRIM related.<br /><br />SCOTT PILGRIM is for all those out there who wanted something different because if you look past the ridiculousness that some people see, you will find absolute brilliance in sound editing, visuals and creativity. The only reason I don't give it the full 5-stars is because the movie is about Scott defeating Ramona Flowers 7 evil exes before he can date her. This gets a little old about 5.<br /><br />Yet, the movie is still not to be missed.verything PILGRIM related.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the Pacific.  It was hit with both of us.  We are now lending it out to friends.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|Just because I issued only 3 stars to SALT, doesn't mean that it isn't a good movie. It is definately worth watching and entertaining depending on your taste in movies. Yet, in recent years, Hollywood, screenwriters and movie producers have taken a poor step in the keep em' happy direction. 'Keep em' happy' in the sense of the movie shouldn't stop. The audience paid for action and their gonna get it.<br /><br />Well, the audience is getting action, but at the expense of character development and setup and explanation and just plain mood. There is little to zero effort by the filmmakers to let us know what is going on inside the main character, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie).<br /><br />The movie opens up with a violent scene of interrogation as Salt is beaten by N.Korean soldiers, accused of being a spy as she repeatedly assures them that she isn't a spy. The audience affectively wonders if maybe she isn't a spy and she is a victim of mistaken identity. Yet, as the scene breaks and she is escorted back to an American helicopter, released by some high power, the movie then jumps to a scene where we discover, quite unceremoniously that, well, she is a spy and an agent for the U.S. government.<br /><br />This pretty much sums up the entire movie from that point on. There are many twists and turns in SALT, but none of them have an ounce of setup or tactic to keep the audience guessing. Everything is right in your face and gets straight to the action, as if the entire movie viewing world weren't smart enough to be toyed with.<br /><br />None of the twists and turns in SALT, and there are many, garner a gasp, or surprise or any reaction other than, \\"where's the popcorn?\\"<br /><br />A good movie that will fall, if it hasn't already, into the pile of movies that will not be thought of ever again, 3 weeks after its video release.
B003WUYQSW|4.0|I had already had my own blog/brand for 3 yrs when I read this book, so a lot of the information I already \\"knew\\" from experience, but the book was still valuable to me and I continue to recommend it. If nothing else, CrushIt inspired me to work harder, really go \\"hole hog\\" and I'm glad I did -- because I ended up getting a book deal and meeting other goals that before felt like lofty aspirations. Every time I read the book, I get new ideas for how to grow my brand -- and that's worth its weight in gold!<br /><br />I also have had the pleasure to meet Gary in person, and email/twitter converse with him -- he is a real gem, and unlike others in this \\"field\\" he truly does want everyone to be happy and successful -- he isn't doing this for personal gain.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|I'm not the kind that holds movies up against other movies as a comparision, but with THE TOWN and HEAT, you can't help it because their so similar in many ways. Both movies gives looks into the souls of both sides of bank robbery: the tormented souls who grew up and were raised in a history and an element of bank robbery that was common place and second nature, and the officers saddled with tracking them down.<br /><br />HEAT had one of the best shoot out scenes in the history of film as the robbers and the police have a shootout that spans a city block and the echoes from the bullets bounce off the tall concrete buildings. Al Pacino ducks from car door to car door as the high powered bank robbers outgun the police. THE TOWN tried to duplicate this, all the way up to the sound of the gunfire bouncing off the tall Boston concrete buildings.<br /><br />There is much to harold about THE TOWN. It is a tremendous film with great performances that is well filmed, well directed and has zero to miniscule fault about it. In fact, I would even go as far as to say that it is one of the best movies of 2010 by far.<br /><br />Yet, its similarities to HEAT are too numerous. HEAT, which is longer and grittier, managed to make us care about both sides of the crime in the same way. We saw into the lives of all characters involved with an equal telescope and we sympathized with them equally. THE TOWN only gives you a deep look into the life of Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) and his dilemma to lead a life that isn't so hazardous. The other characters, with the exception of Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) are only given brush strokes.<br /><br />That makes THE TOWN a good movie and a great movie for 2010, but it pales in comparison to HEAT, which managed to make us care deeper and fuller about all the characters involved, even the bad ones.
0240816250|5.0|There's little reason to reiterate all of the positive comments written by other reviewers.  If one is seeking a complete reference to the technical aspects of analog photography then look no further.  However, what makes Ralph's and Chris's book so different is that the technical and heretofore more esoteric subjects of the analog photography \\"world\\" become more understandable and relevant to everyday practice.  I tend to use WBM, Edition 2, alongside the new edition of Bruce Barnbaum's terrific book ( The Art of Photography ),and the venerable Beyond the Zone System by the late Phil Davis.  Bruce's book has a wonderfully concise and trenchant discussion of the Zone System as obtained and achieved by film exposure and development.  I believe that Bruce's analogy relating film development to the unfolding of a bellows to be the best and most easily understood of any discussion of film processing that I have read. Also, Bruce's approach to making a fine print is to the point, and makes considerable sense. While Bruce Barnbaum is \\"anti-sensitometry\\" and uses empiric methods to great advantage, Professor Davis's book brought sensitometry and the methods of film and paper testing to a larger audience. Phil Davis's work provided the under-pinning to his now classic BTZS methodology, and led to the creation of the ExpoDev program that many large format photographers use \\"in the field\\".  WBM expands on much of the work of Professor Davis, but melds the technical to the practical in ways that will be easily comprehended by many. However, be aware that in general WBM is more of a \\"complete reference book\\", and as such, is somewhat more technical than some might expect. I find the technical details to help in the understanding of the nature of the materials that I use, and the graphs and charts to be relevant.  However, I had already done the requisite film and paper tests before reading WBM, and thus many of the details in WBM( both editions )built upon knowledge already gained. Importantly, if the details of film and paper testing are intimidating, and if the concepts depicted in graphs and charts produce math anxiety, then one might benefit by knowing of the more empiric approach of Bruce Barnbaum. WBM is advertised as a book of advanced techniques, and the authors are to be complimented upon the truth of their statement.  All three of the books noted are worthy of study, and surely can be a help to anyone seeking guidance as to a way to make better black and white analog photographs.  Any one of the books referenced is NOT superior to any of the others; however, the approaches to the more technical aspects of analog photography ARE different. Indeed, one can gain considerable insight by reading relevant discussions of similar subjects concerning analog photography practice in each of the three books referenced.     Note that I  make no comments on the approaches to digital photography sections in WBM, or in Bruce Barnbaum's book. Moreover, since I am not using color film, the sections on color photography in Bruce Barnbaum's book are not relevant to my work.
193413712X|1.0|There is a fine line between poetic prose woven into artful fiction and self-indulgent writing written by an author in love with his own order of words. Unfortunately, \\"Tinkers\\" flies through that line with gusto and careens past self-indulgence from its very beginning and it never looks back. Not since \\"Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer\\" by Steven Millhauser has the Pulitzer been wrongly awarded. This book is only about 200  pages long. Yet it feels much much longer. Bad books like this do a disservice to the good books Pulitzer has recognized through the years. If you must read a small book, even \\"The Bridges of Madison County,\\" with all its overwrought romanticism out shines \\"Tinkers.\\" Only read \\"Tinkers\\" if you are like that insane group of us who insist on reading every Pulitzer Prize winner in fiction.[[ASIN:193413712X Tinkers]]
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The question that everyone asked, myself included, is this as good as Band of Brothers? In a word, no, but that does not mean it is not a good show. It doesn't have the character developmnet of Band of Brothers,we don't get to know them as well, I found myself wondering who was who several times while watching. The story line was little off pace,it wanderd a bit, it just seemed like it was maybe a rushed project. But-- a story worth telling and definately worth watching. Every American should know what our boys went through for our sake, something we can't even imagine today --God bless 'em all! 4 out of 5 stars.
B002ZG98UK|1.0|I ordered this item at least a week before release and Amazon did not ship it until a week after it was released. [[ASIN:B002ZG98UK Resident Evil: Afterlife [Blu-ray 3D]]]
B003UESJH4|5.0|There are many, many wonderful things to say about this film--from performances and script through technical merits--but it's the relationship between Firth's and Rush's characters that is utterly sublime. The interplay between the men is at turns comedic, dramatic, hilarious, and heart-breaking.  Both actors deserve to be giving acceptance speeches at this year's Oscars.  One of the best films this year to be certain.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was reluctant to watch this as it seemed long and I didn't know anything about the story or the actors. I ended up watching because of the reviews, and it was truely AMAZING! So well done, a beautiful stroy that pulls you in to the that time period and hold you there. The love story was just so beautiful as well. Don't miss it!
B00139W3NE|3.0|I loved this book and wanted to see the movie. As usual, the movie wasn't as good as the book. They did follow the story pretty well, although they omitted the last part of the book completely. I'm guessing that was for time's sake. The special effects were nice, especially the bears, and I really enjoyed the demons. I usually dislike seeing life-like animals talk, but it was well-done. The way that the demons changed form was beautiful.     The main thing I really disliked was the way Lyra \\"read\\" the compass. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't read the book or seen the movie, but I don't see any reason why they couldn't have followed the book more accurately to portray how she learned to read the compass. As is usually the case when long books are turned into movies, I think that the reason the movie wasn't that good was that it was event, event, event, without much character development. There just isn't enough time for a movie to develop characters well when a book is so long. So I guess I shouldn't have expected too much.
0688014291|5.0|Very simple, straightforward book. I believe it's a great guide to manage your own personal life, kids, co-workers... Highly recommend it!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|The blu ray version connected to a 1080p HDTV produces the clearest and most beautiful images on the market. A good way to show off what your HDTV is capable of.  And the sound is right up there as well.
B0043X7WLA|5.0|It was a little difficult to listen to this uncharacteristically electro album from Sufjan Stevens, but now it's my favorite.  I saw the concert as well; there's an interesting story behind this album and the artwork.  I recommend you give it a chance.
0671042858|3.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is not Stephen King's best work. It's short, but not very captivating, so it makes for a long read. It had sat on my bookshelf for years, and, after completing it, I'm glad I didn't rush to read it. The main character is young and likable. She's also much smarter than I imagine most kids her age are. The baseball analogies are light throughout the novel, so please don't let that deter you from reading it. If you're looking for a true Stephen King thriller, this may not be the book for you.
0743437497|5.0|This book is amazing!  Especially if you read it before you watch the movie.  It is terrifying.  I could only read it during the day!  This book keeps you guessing and wanting more.  I could not stop reading it.  There is a twist you wont see coming.  Read this if you haven't, it's definitely one of King's best!
B003R0LBVW|1.0|This book wants to be a literary giant. It is a giant, a giant bore. This book makes me wonder who it is that selects books for Oprahs list. I think the only reason this book was chosen was its often referenced liberal slant. As someone who has enjoyed the majority of Oprahs selections, I bought this one without reading any reviews or plot summaries. I found this book boring, trite, and over indulgent. How this book became so highly related in spite of its poor reviews remains a mystery to me. Good luck!
B00280LYIC|5.0|recently i read the book the lighting theif it was an amazing well written book, i for one reccomend this book for all ages, its a book thats hard to put down and is about an interesting adventure evryone can agree on.
B001F12J0C|3.0|Love the movies but very annoying to re-code and burn to enable play on Australian DVD Player :(  Had to use DVD Fab as DVD Shrink 3.2 did not compress disc 2 or 3  If selling internationally please either sell as Region free or in the Region your are posting to.  Or make it very obvious that they are Region 1 discs.
B000002HHB|5.0|I have bought this cd 6 times now.  A new GF has never heard it, I play it for her, she loves it and takes it. Natalie Merchant has a voice all her own.  The perfect melancholy record.  I listen to it when it rains.  She wrote a great song about River Phoenix, and the spectacle after his death.  It transcends even today.  Cowboy Romance is a favorite if you have ever been in a dive bar people watching. The hits Carnival, and Jealousy are on this record. Beloved Wife is extremely powerful, and if you have lost a spouse... remove all ropes, narcotics, firearms, and sharp objects before listening to it.  Your can hear Natalie choke back tears while she is singng it.  Even if you don't know who she is, or wasn't really into the stuff you heard,  this is a great record.  The women in my life agree, that's why they always steal it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Dogs are all like Hachi. They live for their human owners, they love them so much they can't even think living without them. I have four, and I can totally relate. I can see the joy in their eyes when I return home from work, and I can see their sadness when I prepare for a trip where they can't come along (which are very few, so far we have not taken them to Australia because of the quarantine, but they have joined us everywhere else: USA and Europe alike). Hachi is just that. A film about that strong relationship among a dog and his person, which is as strong as the one among a parent and child.  And if you are a loving dog owner, you can't bear to see how sad your dog will be if you can't be with him or her anymore. My family and I watched this movie on TV the other night, and we all weeped for most part of it, even my eleven year old boy who likes to play the tough guy.  However, I would suggest this movie to any perspective owner, especially here in Italy, where many dogs are given as Christmas gifts and then left on the side of streets and highways a few months later. It should be a deterrent...
B000UVT3OI|5.0|A must have for the Garth Fan. It was a gift for my GF, and she has thanked me numerous times. The DVD that comes with the set was worth the price alone.  I personally was never a Garth Brookes fan, but this set changed that.  I also like his cover of Little Feat's Dixie Chicken [not on this set] My GF asked \\"who's singing Garths' song?  I replied \\"the people that wrote it\\". A Google search proved me right, and so she bought me the No Fences cd so I could hear how Dixie Chicken should be done.  The 3 disk set was brand new, and under $15.00.  Well worth the money.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I just don't get it. I saw THE AMERICAN  in theaters when it was released this summer. I just saw the newly released DVD version, and guess what? The whole first scene shot in Sweden is CUT OUT OF THE FILM!! A pivotal scene where Clooney is hunted in the snow by assassins.  Then at the end of the scene he shoots his lover in the back.because she is a witness. My Cynicism tells me they wanted Clooney's character to be more sympathetic in the DVD version. What in hell is going on? DVD's ADD BONUS scenes, NOT ABRIDGED versions of the original release. PLEASE!! Someone tell me what happened?? perplexed-PETE P.S. NO ONE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTION. why was the 1st scene dvd release EDITED FROM THE ORIGINAL RELEASE???

0061714372|5.0|Taking into consideration that nobody has a higher opinion of Dave than Dave, this book is a fun read. He's basically a ninja, invented metal, the internet, shred, the spork, and dollar draft night.<br /><br />If you read this knowing that you're about to embark on an epic tale of fiction written in Dave's candid style, The Tale of Dave The Superhero is a good read.
B002RSDW80|3.0|Interesting movie. But Julia child was way more intersting. Not fun to see someone so self absorbed that she treats her husband so badly because of her blog readers and the stress of finishing this project.

B000FC130E|5.0|I first stumbled into this book a few years ago, and it was about two or three days ago that I finally made the decision to get through the rest of it and finish it. The only thing that I have to say is \\"Wow!\\"<br /><br />The story concerns a place known as London Below, which is a dark and forgotten world that exists \\"under\\" the London Above. It is a memorable world that is inhabited by fuedal warriors, beings of supernatural power, and those who are unfortunate enough to fall through the cracks from London Above.<br /><br />Gaiman's style is immediately engaging. This book has a modern feel to it, and I have fallen in love with the universe that he has created. I have always felt that one of the biggest mistakes that any fantasy writers can make is to \\"explain everything away\\" and supply a reader with appendixes, glossaries, and pages upon pages of facts.<br /><br />So, yes. It was charming, it was magical, and it was beautiful. And so this book deserves the highest possible rating that I can give it.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|the first season of glee will no doubt be an instant classic and to have the whole season on dvd is very convient well worth the price

B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie is absoultely the total package, from the casts, to the story line and to the graphics. I swear it made my IQ go up! It kept me on the edge of my seat and I loved every minute of it. My outlook look on dreams is completely different now thanks to Inception. I love this movie. Definitely a classic.
0439023521|5.0|I had resisted reading this book series as I had resisted \\"The Girl Who\\" series. . . sometimes these blockbusters are just not for me.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />Suzanne Collins pulls her reader in from page one of the Hunger Games, and as Stephen King said in his review, \\"It's a speed-rap of a novel that generates constant suspense.\\"<br /><br />I liked Katniss and Peeta and their way of dealing with the terror and fame thrust upon them.  Gale is also a winning personality.<br /><br />This is not \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"Moby Dick,\\" but I felt the political commentary was clear, the idea of maintaining our sense of self in a celebrity-mad world.  Collins also depicts the have's and have not's with compassion.<br /><br />Memorable writing.  Keeper!<br /><br />And my list of top YA books for 2010 just moved around to make room at the top for the Hunger Games Trilogy.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great!
0312600844|5.0|This book was, to me, the best I have read in a very long time -- maybe forever -- and I'm very old.  I liked it mostly for one reason:  the author is utterly brilliant at dialog and the art of the slow plot.  Most sentences were, for me, pleasing gems that left me stunned at Franzen's talent at words and often laughing sometimes crying.  He is a master craftsman.  Don't disparage a plot that you find \\"unrealistic\\" or \\"unbelievable\\" just because you can't imagine living the lives of such finely drawn characters as his.  To me these characters were both very unlike me and very believeable.  Most characters in fiction could actually exist just as they're portrayed.  We just haven't personally met them yet.
1401310400|3.0|As a fan of the Castle TV show, I really enjoyed the story and concur with the positive comments of other reviewers, but buy the hardcover version! The trade paperback borders on unreadable, with microscopic type, almost no thumb space  and type that goes so far into the binding that one has to guess how lines end.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|This soundtrack fits really well for Daft Punk. I'm really surprised that Disney released a soundtrack this cool. I heard this at a new years eve party and fell in love with it. The whole soundtrack sounded really edgy and cool.This is a must have for any party and long trip. It will defiantely keep you interested!
B002ZG98LO|2.0|First off, I still have yet to see the Predators actually look as bad-ass as they looked in Predator and Predator 2, sleek and organic.  In AVP2, I'll give it credit, the Predator looked sleek and cool, but his face looked like an anvil fell on his face.  AVP 1 and Predators, the Predators look like a bunch of overweight ex-wrestlers.    Doesn't live up to those old suits, sorry.  Also, where are the Predators in this movie?  They're barely in this movie!  I could care less about a bunch of multi-cultural merceranies on their way to try and create the first film.    This movie may have been in the respect that it got people back into Predators the franchise, but just weak.  Topher Grace did a good job, go figure, the guy without any guns.    Predator and Predator 2 are still king.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|My wife is a big fan of the series, I got this for her for Christmas.  Only weird part is that the discs are packaged in 6 cases, one per character, in the box, while there are 10 seasons.  The included book makes it easy to determine which season you are on, but it's not quite intuitive.  Also, our book came with the external cover misprinted, seeming to be reversed and upside down... weird.  In all, a great purchase though.    As another reviewer noted, this is FULLSCREEN, as the original series was shot before widescreen was in use for TV, so no widescreen version is available.
B0042MEQVG|2.0|I loved the first Twilight movie:  in fact, it's what caused me to go out and buy the quartet of books by Stephenie Meyer.  Director Catherine Hardwicke brought the characters and the town of Forks to life with finesse and style.  The directors of the 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse' have done little more than flatten the characters into two-dimensional comic-book fodder.   I'm holding out hope for something MUCH better with 'Breaking Dawn'.
0394721772|5.0|This cookbook and it's prequel show steps in cooking from scratch with quality ingredients. You can learn techniques to make very good food. My daughter loves it, although she is working more with the first volume. She made a fine garlic soup for her guests. I was out of town so I will have to wrangle an invitation to another meal. Fans of the recent movie about a woman who cooked all the Julia Child recipes in the book who like to cook will love it. (movie was Julie and Julia, I think)

Our old friends Buzz and Woody meet some new friends for some new adventures. Buzz speaks espanol(spanish), the toys almost get burnt and the aliens save the day. We recommend this movie for kids over the age of 5 because some parts are scary. Overall, we give this movie 4 stars!
B001EN71CW|5.0|I was so choked when they cancelled this show and I love having it on blu-ray now.  This set is great cause it even has extra episodes that never aired and there are only three discs so you don't have to be changing discs all the time if you want to watch them all in a row.  Great quality, I'm absolutley loving it and now I've got all my friends hooked too!

B0044WUQ3G|1.0|What a terrible film and waste of time. The movie has zero argument and the roles are played poorly. no common sence whatsoever... why would you go skiing with no cellphone, no power bars, no water.... this is a really really really bad movie. DO NOT WATCH IT!!!
B00448SE4S|2.0|This worked until about half way through and froze and I could not see the end of the movie.  Amazon refunded the purchase price.

B000WN8AHA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo19J2VUUBSLWJO]]This is a classic kit that has never lost its appeal. This kit helped Tamiya established itself with a reputation for quality when it was first introduced back in the early 1970's.  The details are great. Every rivet and every bolt is reproduced from the real vehicle to the model. The five figures included are beyond my expectations. They are well detailed and the fighting poses they are in blows me away. I can't get a better model to build at the price I paid.    The kit contains several sprues all carefully wrapped up in plastic bags. Included are two sets of instructions in both English and Japanese. The instructions are very easy to understand and it includes a good history of the Hanomag which is quite interesting. Assembly was straightforward and easy. It only took me a few evenings to build it.     This classic kit is well worth every penny. There are critics who say that because it's old means that it's not worth your time building it. I beg to differ. Just because it's a classic doesn't mean it's a bad kit.  This kit is like a classic car. The older it gets, the more one appreciates its design and looks.
0061544493|4.0|Great book.  I was in love with the way that Victoria's personality was present in her writing.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants a good fashion read or just something to simply flip through to get a few fashion tips!    Pictures were fun to look at too!
0375842209|5.0|There are a lot of reviews on this book that say something along the lines of \\"ANOTHER WWII book, ugh\\". Yes, this is a book that is centered around the war. However, this is told in a different way. It's the story of the Holocaust, of bombings, of a little girl's understanding, and many other things. I have read more books on the war, both fact and fiction, than I can possibly count. It's always fascinated me. When I saw this book and read the summary, I just couldn't wait to get it home and read it.     Being told by Death is a strong point of this story, I think. I know a lot of people don't like that part, but since Death (in more ways than one) is such a huge part of war, being told from that point of view is a great way to tell a story. Death is very empathetic, sympathetic and poetic. He describes situations by using colors. He cares for Liesel and Rudy. He makes sure Liesel's story is told.    When I finished this book, I found myself wanting to know more about what Liesel did in her life. Yes, it does say she did this and that, but it doesn't go into detail. I wanted to know more about Max, and did Max and Liesel marry like some think?     This story will pull at your heart. It does start off slow and does slow down at some parts, but it is worth reading all the way through. I read that a movie adaptation is in the works, and I hope that is true. I would love to see Liesel's story come to life on screen.
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|My daughter has gone through the TinkerBell phase, and particularly likes it because one fairy looks like her, instead of it just being a story of the blond haired TinkerBell.  This movie was enjoyable to watch, certainly more so for kids.  As with the first TinkerBell movie, I found my mind wandering and don't find these fairy stories as uplifting or adventurous like some of the other Disney movies, i.e. Mulan, Pocahantas, Aristocats, Toy Story...  The storyline isn't that much of a new thing, a sort of absent minded parent when it comes to their kids, but of course, it all works out in the end.<br />  The animation is impressive, it is colorful and cheery, but just don't expect a very thought provoking movie.  If your child is a big fairy fan, then you can't go wrong, but if not, the movie might miss its mark.  Still, its replay value is quite limited.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I think the version narrated by David Attenborough is so much better than the one narrated by Oprah. The quality of the Blu-ray is great and fast delivery.
B001E9641K|5.0|I am already a Ticket to Ride (TtR) fan, owning the original game [[ASIN:B0002TV2LU Ticket to Ride]], but because my daughter really likes to play the original, I thought I would go with the Nordic theme.  The advantage this game has over the first TtR is that it is a better game to play when you only have 2 or 3 players.  The playing board becomes tighter and it seems you just can't get to your turn fast enough to do all the things you want.  The original game can play up to 5 players.  As a quick review, with Ticket to Ride games, your turn can only be 1 of 3 different actions available.  1)Pick up 2 train cards. 2) Or place trains on the board. 3) Or pick up 3 more destination tickets.  That's it.  Train cards are just colored cards with pictures of trains on them, nothing written on them to make things difficult.  And you can have 1 train card or 50 in your hand if you want. Simple, yet you need to have a strategy to win.<br /><br />  This Nordic version has full sized train and destination cards also, better than the little ones in TtR.  I was a bit leery about the addition of tunnels and ferries in this version, expecting it to be a confusing addition to the game, but it isn't.  Again, my fears are totally out of line.  The best thing about the Nordic version is that you can't use the wild locomotive cards wherever/whenever you want to.  So, if the route calls for 5 green trains, you need 5 green train cards, no wild cards accepted!  Still, on a handful of land routes, the colored spaces will have a locomotive printed on it, and that requires the use of a wild card.  So, on some you will see 5 green spaces, but the first green space has a locomotive pictured on it, so you turn in 4 green cards and a wild card (which is aka the locomotive card).  Tunnel and ferry routes can use wild cards freely, with tunnels being \\"risky\\" to build on, because it may cost you more matching train cards to build on than than is shown on the route...but again, it might not.  An easy rule to pick up and play with.<br /><br />  Now, if you are reading this and having never played a TtR game, do yourself a favor and try this one.  I would pick it over the original game, unless you will have more than 3 players regularly.  It still kills me how Monopoly, Life, Mousetrap and other kid games are soooo dependent on paper money, cheap cards, cheap components and boxes that collapse, as well as lots of special rules and fiddly things that you have to keep referring to the rule book for.  Ticket to Ride has none of those issues.  And you can play this game in 30-45 minutes.  Easy set up, easy put away.  Do my kids ask to play Monopoly or Ticket to Ride??  Definitely this cool train game wins out, every time.rule to pick up and play with.         Now, if you are reading this and having never played a TtR game, do yourself a favor and try this one.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|This movie was a waste of time. My wife and I sat and watched it (she read the Chinese subtitles), and I listened to the English. Afterward, we were both confused (in our respective languages).<br /><br />The director/ writer tries really hard to be cute/ cerebral/ esoteric (in only that way that Weird Artistic People can be), but succeeds mostly in just looking foolish.<br /><br />Save your money.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|A recent second viewing only made the experience better.  A wonderful movie, dreamlike, bravely acted, bravely written, both tense and comedic, with fabulous cinematography.  This is one I could watch again and again.  Why did it take a film company and director from Bavaria to create such a marvel from the eternal California-truck-stop-cafe theme? C.C.H. Pounder is brilliant --- my fear that she might overdo her character was unfounded --- a treat to watch her in all her moods.  Jack Palance [of all people] was angelic, a wonderful light and loving role, gently done, utterly believable. The score and the theme song are charming.  The director made the bleak desert and its highway enthralling by day and night. This is the off-highway cafe that we all wish we knew.

B002ZG98J6|5.0|This movie was soo much fun to watch! Great effects and wonderful story line that had me guessing for most of the movie. I sat and watched this with a friend, who normally is very critical of everything, SHE loved it! This was a movie that I could watch and enjoy with my 7 year old goddaughter and her mother and they were both hooked! I have watched this several times and I keep catching something new each time I watch it. I was happy to add this movie to my blu-ray collection!
B002ZG981E|1.0|I do not see what everyone say's they see in this. It's not complicated. It's a mess. The explanations we get through the long setup contradict what is happening in the movie. A huge flop.<br /><br />It's about dreams and extracting information from someone. Basically, a thief. However, the twist happens when the victim of a theft wants to hire his thieves to plant an idea in someone's mind instead of extracting. Awesome, sounds like a great movie plot. However, this movie was way too long. With way too much information. Also, as much as people say the ending is jaw dropping, I didn't see that, I saw it coming and I hated it. It's basically, a puzzle with no end.<br /><br />For me there are too many questions and no answers. It was way too long of a movie and about 14 minutes into it my husband stopped watching. I've always had a fascination with my dreams so I felt like I had to hang in there. I kept telling him, it has to get better. Everyone loves it. I've heard nothing but good things. Well, lets just say he's fairly furious that I watched the entire thing.<br /><br />The visual dynamics of the movie were pretty impressive but there has to be more to a movie than that. I guess I just needed more character development and less visuals and way more answers.
B002OFWG7O|4.0|Good range of examples, the earlier of which I remember as heavily played cuts on MTV, (back when they actually played videos) with that distinct Foo-Fighter look & sound. Some cheezy special FX, but character-development & the visual-story, blend in with the lyrics & live-action very well. If you like the music, you probably will enjoy the visual interpretations & performances. Fair price as well.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|The story line is something we've all seen before; if you've ever watched Disney's Pocahontas you're going to think, \\"Wow, this is really familiar!\\" However, this movie takes the tale and adds its own twist giving it a strong and in my opinion, a solid story line. Complimenting the already well done script is the reason why most went to see this film -- it is undeniably visually stunning. It was made for 3D and those who watched it for the first time WITH 3D saw a complete world in a film that was made FOR 3D and where it wasn't later adapted for 3D as an afterthought.    Even without 3D, this movie is still beautiful, flawless and vividly done. I believe it's worth owning. There are not many movies this long that you can watch again and again and get something new out of it. I've watched it 4 times and never felt like it was dragging on, each time learning something new about the story I didn't catch before or seeing something I hadn't noticed the first few times.    When a movie can create a culture, explain that culture, and make you FEEL for that culture (who wasn't on the side of the Na'vi at the end?) you can't say that it wasn't a well written story. It rouses emotions, both positive and negative, and it's worth owning if you enjoyed it when you saw it (or rented it).
B002JIOQCO|5.0|Excellent, hard-driving rock album. Strong Sabbath influences, but a much more varied sense of composition and a cleaner sound. Doesn't break too much new ground, but a splendid realization of the classic 70's rock sound with modern influences and production.

0156027321|1.0|I love to read and I read a lot of books of different styles.  I heard about how great this book was, so I had high hopes for it.    I started to read and got to page 40 and I was so bored and confused and kept having to go back.  I decided not to finish it which VERY rarely happens.  When I saw all the prizes that the book had won, I thought that I must need to give it another try.    Well, I finally gave up on page 68.  I guess it's just not my cup of tea.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|Like most people, I've seen version after version of Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL. It's a great story but I'd never read the ACTUAL story. I finally downloaded this version to my Kindle and dug in.     I was surprised to see how much of Dickens actual dialogue has been used by so many of the filmmakers. The language is dated but seems to add to the appeal of the story for me. If you can get it at the current price of FREE, please don't hesitate to do so.
0439023513|3.0|Ok first things firt if you havent read the book then dont read this.       Every thing is great until the end. Finnick dies(arrg) and so does Prim(boo). That alone made me very dissapointed. Then look what happens next. Katniss lets Gale move! One of the things that bugs me is Katniss dosent take action! She usally has someone else do it(like Gale). I mean yes, she does somethings but not many!So at first Katniss and Gale were doing good, then comes Peeta , who ruins everything for them.(NOT COOL) That and the fact that Katniss THINKS(NOT KNOWS!) that Gale killed Prim.So Katniss lets her \\"BESTFRIEND\\" walk off to district 2!So that made me really mad. It reminds me of all those times she kisses Gale and know she loves him. But most of all it reminds me of her thinking \\"Hes mine and Im his\\" about her and Gale in book 2.So it kind of makes me think that she backstabbed Gale. He did a lot off things for her and look what she did! But I also think that Gale and Katniss need each other. It dosent say so in that book but you can tell it from the last books. So when she just lets him go so easily it kind of wierd. So what im saying is that Gale and Katniss belong together. Not Petta and Katniss.They are so alike the should be insepprable. So if Mrs. Suzanne Collins is reading this ,  i would like to know what would have happened if Petta was killed in the First book? If Katniss came home as lone victor? Would her and Gale be together? Sure if you wrote another book about \\"What if Peeta Dies?\\" It will be about diffrent things , but I dont think Im the only person who is curiouse about that. So if you did right a book like that , make it about Katniss bieng a Mentor, and her falling in love with Gale, and them trying to stop the Hunger Games. To me that would be just as entertaining. Katniss and Gale need each other.So i say the book it ok. And i do recomend the Series to a lot of People. But the thing with Gale deffenitly brings my vote for it down.             From, Derec's daughter Ashley Anderson. [...]      ps:  MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR!!!!!
1400052173|5.0|I have mixed feeling about the information I read in this book, but I know one thing for sure, I am glad I read it.  I received a large amount of information from this book that I never received in my education as a healthcare provider and as a patient.  I really enjoyed learning about the Lacks family and their struggles due to Henrietta's untimely death and immortality.  Good writing and Thank you for the insight and courage to put information about research and tissue samples out their for the lay person to know.
1439133948|5.0|Bujold has always had a deft hand mixing humor with dead-serious (and yes, I meant that to be punny) issues in her Vorkosigan series.  Here, her unlikely yet quintessential hero Miles, in his role as Barrayaran Imperial Auditor, is investigating the hint of something not quite right with the major cryocorps on the planet Kibou-daini, who are seeking to expand their business to the Barrayaran Empire.  Miles is attending a conference on the cryogenics business practiced on Kibou-daini, a planet obsessed with being frozen as a stepping block to a sort of immortality.  Since the process is somewhat expensive for the common man, the corporations have fixed it so that they can get the voting rights of their clients in return... thus becoming major political powers depending on how successful they are at attracting clients.  This and other quirks of a society trying to cheat death figure in the background of this adventure--and adventure it is when Miles is concerned.  For instance, he barely lands before he's kidnapped by anti-cryocorps terrorists.  So much for an uneventful trip to peek at possible irregularities in the corps' figures!<br /><br />Only Miles can make something like being drugged and having a severe reaction to that... and somehow escaping terrorists, then wandering lost among the endless miles of Cryocombs holding dead bodies... and ending up among a building of squatters working on a not-so-legal operation at the edge of town seem like a light-hearted adventure.  And yet for Miles, it is, somewhat.  Sure, he's sick, sleep-deprived and having a totally bad trip, basically out of his mind... but he's not dead (just revived from the dead and subject to seizures... on a good day).  He meets a young boy among the squatters, who is the only one interested in aiding the drug-addled Miles.  So, sure, there are some cute scenes with kids... but the kids are motherless because the mother was agitating for more equal access to cryogenics... which gives Miles another thing to look at concerning the possible hanky-panky perpetrated by the corporations...  And more adventure and danger and suspense ensue.<br /><br />Those who enjoy the Miles books should definitely enjoy this one.  It's not quite like having a planet about to blow up, but the ramifications of what Miles has to deal with are dire enough.  This really is another brilliant and brilliantly different addition to an incredible series.to look at concerning the possible hanky-panky perpetrated by the corporations...

0340203161|2.0|After waiting several weeks to get the book I was disappointed to see the hardcover was a small edition which was not stated in the offering. The print is almosr as small as a soft covered book and since this is a long book I was looking foward to luxuriating in reading a book that would not strain my eyes.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This rules of this game are simple, but its enjoyable for everyone in my family of ranging ages from 8 to 61. It's a four player game, and each game lasts about 15 minutes. We don't play games much, but we play this one over and over again.

B0038M2AZA|4.0|Overall a very inspiring true story, depicting how one woman, with the help of family and friends, faced and overcame the challenges of her autism.<br />Solid story, great casting, good directing, fantastic acting.  Claire Danes should really be up for an oscar for this role (even though I think all those awards shows are a bunch of malarky).<br />The movie is based on two books, which I believe were both written by Temple herself.  I haven't read the books, nor did I know much about this story before I watched the movie.  So you don't have to be interested in autism to watch this movie!  It is that good!<br />The movie follows Temple on her way to college, through college, and after her graduation with flashbacks on her past.  So while it doesn't give the whole story of her life, it gives you a good enough foundation so you have a feeling for what her life and struggles have been like.  She was, and is, and incredible role model for anyone who is faced with any type of challenge.<br />A note, this movie does talk about and show, while not anything gory, the general process of cow slaughter, since that is what Temple became passionate about raising the standard for.  So if that goes against your beliefs, you may have issue watching this movie.<br />My only complaint about this movie, was the flashbacks were a little distracting because I got lost on what time period I was watching.  Other then that, it's a great movie!  Had me laughing and cheering and tearing up!
0786956291|5.0|This is a fantastic introductory product to the game. I had never played D&D before so I thought I would give this a try and at Amazon's pricing I figured even if I didn't like it I would only be out $13. I was not disappointed. It is laid out in a basic fashion with the solo adventure acting as a sort of training in character creation and basic combat, with more details on gameplay in the group adventure. I should mention that I noticed a few oversights in the editing, though these are easy to overlook. Bear in mind as well that this is only an introduction to the game, it will take you up to level 2 and to continue you will have to purchase more literature. Obviously how much literature you buy depends on yourself but after playing this with my friends I immediately went out and spent another $80 on more D&D books because I enjoyed it so much. Another thing that I should make note of is that the characters you make in the starter kit might not necessarily match the characters you would make using the new players handbooks, but it just gives you an excuse to recreate your character, which I absolutely loved. I would easily recommend this product to anyone who has never played the game before and was interested in giving it a shot, it's only $13!
B002ZG983M|2.0|Overall, not as funny as I had hoped for, and a tad more gory then I was ready for.  This was a movie where the trailer was better then the movie.<br />The movie follows a young outcast high school boy, as he decides to change his life, by becoming a Super Hero, complete with outfit and all.  However, his first confrontation doesn't turn out so well, when he is stabbed and beaten to a pulp.  Though that doesn't seem to deter him from trying again, after he mends up from getting out of hospital, which is when he meets Hit Girl and Big Daddy, the real take-no- prisoners-crime-fighters of the movie.  And Hit Girl, is awesome!  But it doesn't take long for the bad guys to find the newest Super Hero, and mistake him for the one damaging their business, when it was really Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  So the battles ensue, with a final blow out battle and somewhat happy ending.<br />It was a great idea for a story, though I felt the movie fell short on delivering the story to screen.  I did like think the idea for the story was unique, as was the inclusion of the comic book story as a way of depicting the story.  It has some fantastic action sequences in it for sure!<br />Though, it wasn't as funny as it could have been, in my opinion, or as witty.  Nor did I find the characters as compelling, as I wanted or hoped for them to be, which leads me to believe that the writing was a little lacking in character development, as well as story.<br />I'm fine going to a horror movie and having some gore.  However, this movie, had way too much for my tastes.  And I don't believe it really needed the gore in it, to make the point or be visually entertaining/interesting.<br />If you're looking for action and gore, with some humor, this might be just the ticket.  Otherwise, if you're expecting a really funny movie, and a great story, you may want to pass...<br />It was somewhat of a let down for me, and one that would not be included in my library.
B003XMXZCW|4.0|Con 30 años de edad y nunca tuve la oportunidad de ver esta pelicula antes, dado que no he visto standard-definition DVD's antes no puedo comparar este release, pero hablando de calidad de video, me parece sorprendente para la edad del film, no puedo dar opinion del soundtrack dado que aun no poseo un sistema de audio rspetable, pero pude ver la pelicula en mi Toshiba rezga 40\\" LCD, 120Hz y los resultados son un detalle unico que solo puede verse gracias al formato. Los Close-ups, las imagenes de la jungla y las secuencias de bombardeos son mis favoritos.    Ver las apariciones de M. Brando y escuchar sus lineas hacen que uno piense que el tipo puede no estar tan loco, y mas bien podria ser el resultado de su brillante \\"carrera\\" militar considerada por muchos perfecta. Le pelicula queda 100% recomendada para aquellos que no la han visto, y para aquellos que ya han tenido la oportunidad de verla y desean revivir las emociones pues adelante, les aseguro que nunca han visto Apocalyse Now en esta manera.    I am 30 years old, and I had never the opportunnity to see this movie, call it teathers, VHS DVD or TV, so I cannot compare this release with others out in the market. But talking about video quality the only word that can describe the quality is AMAZING (please think about the film's age).I cannot write a lot about sound quality because I do not have a good audio system (yet), I have a Toshiba Rezga 40\\" LCD-120Hz and the result is an unique level of detail only possible thanks to the format. The close-us, the jungle scenes and the bombing secuences are my favorites.    To see Marlon Brando and hear his lines makes you think \\"may be this man is not crazy, may be he is the product of his perfect militar career\\". I recommend the movie to those who have not seen the movie yet, and for those who had the pleasure to see it then go ahead I can assure you that you had never seen this movie with this quality
015206396X|5.0|Graceling is another one of those books that makes writing reviews difficult because you can't seem to find the words to appropriately sum up your love for it. This book was simply incredible; an action-packed fantasy adventure with a heartfelt romance and kick-ass characters.<br /><br />Katsa is so strong and independent that it's easy to quickly love and respect her. Growing up in a kingdom with an uncle that prisons her and forces her to use her Grace to torture/kill, she still has her beliefs and dignity in tact, even if she can be stubborn at times. Those beliefs are questioned when she meets Po, a Graceling prince, but Po ... *dreamy sigh* Po is so sweet and understanding that he inadvertently softens her. And it's so admirable that their relationship slowly develops. So many novels make a leap into the romance so hastily, but Cashore leaves us absolutely begging for a first kiss between the two.<br /><br />Even the smaller details and characters of the book contribute to the greatness; Bitterblue, Raffin and Oll, the side characters in Katsa and Po's life, aren't in the novel for very long, but it's enough to make you fall in love with them. And the carefully designed Seven Kingdoms and the personalities of the kings that rule them make the book seem so authentic.<br /><br />Overall, Graceling is a fantastic tale of love, freedom, self-control and self-discovery. It was epic and heartwarming and just - gah - so good. If you're like me and have dragged your feet at picking this one up, take my word for it and run to the bookstore to get yourself a copy! You won't be disappointed!
0385512104|5.0|Having enjoyed  Asperger Syndrome and Anxiety: A Guide to Successful Stress Management by Nick Dubin and hearing from Judith Miller at amazon.com that \\"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" by Mark Haddon and from another friend, Kendra, at Goodreads that  Born on a Blue Day: Inside the  Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant by Daniel Tammet were also exceptionally  good books I decided to purchase them both.  I've not yet read the later; however, I enjoyed Haddon's fictional book told from the perspective of Christopher John Francis Boone, an autistic and gifted 15-year old living in modern day England.<br /><br />While Christopher may not be representative of all autistic people, he was an interesting and believable character that I will not soon forget.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|I loved this book! I'm not usually a \\"romance book\\" reader but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It took me back to my early post-college days and all the possibilities that awaited! Then the reality that those possibilities may not be all they seem.  Such a well written book that I wanted to read it twice.  I think 30-somethings will especially enjoy it

B002ZG98CS|4.0|Don't take MACHETE (the film) seriously.  But you'd better take Machete (the man) seriously--because he means business.  He is a former Mexican Federale whose life is ruined by a drug lord (Steven Seagal, of course), hired by a corrupt senator and his underling (Robert De Niro and Jeff Fahey, respectively).  Pursued by a beautiful immigration agent (Jessica Alba) and a seductive but deadly freedom fighter (Michele Rodriguez), Machete must fight to save his honor--and the lives of his people.<br /><br />The performances are surprisingly strong throughout.  The film rests on Danny Trejo's broad, tattooed shoulders; fortunately, he IS Machete, with the tough attitude (and a surprising level of sensitivity) to carry out this role, even making it slightly more complex than it requires.  Seagal's Spanish is atrocious, but he is the embodiment of cool, even if he is far past his prime (I won't say his acting is good; it's Steven Seagal we're talking about, after all).  De Niro has made a lot of schlock lately, but he's clearly enjoying making a movie that's INTENTIONALLY campy.  Fahey oozes sleaze and cool; his slick-backed, gun-toting crime lord persona is arguably one of the better ones to grace the genre.  Alba and Rodriguez are both solid (Rodriguez usually is; for Alba, this is a pleasant surprise); it's nice to see female characters that avoid the typical eye-candy action role.<br /><br />MACHETE is basically Robert Rodriguez at his best: pulling no punches, taking nothing seriously, just having a grand, gory good time.  It's an action movie with no logical plot or plausible character development; it's a movie where Lindsay Lohan appears in a nun costume, for God's sake (all of the puns intended).  We've also got Cheech Marin as a gun-toting preacher (\\"God forgives; I don't\\"); Don Johnson as a murderous vigilante; and Tom Savini as a professional assassin.  We've got a script that is good for what it is (and that's all it's supposed to be); and the co-directing by Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis is frantic and fast-paced.  There are a few slow spots (hence the four stars) that hinder the movie, but ultimately, if you're a fan of grindhouse cinema (or just like a good, old-fashioned, no-holds-barred action thrill ride), MACHETE is a movie you will thoroughly enjoy.n Maniquis is frantic and fast-paced.

B0041KKYEM|4.0|Vincent Cassel said in a recent 'Fresh Air' interview that there are a couple of roles in one's lifetime that require you to make a physical transformation.  He mentioned [[ASIN:B003OZ2KB0 Mesrine 1 & 2 (2008, France) *ULTIMATE* 4 Disc Set (R0)]] for him - he took on considerable weight for Part II of that film.  Here so, in 'Black Swan,' it was for Natalie Portman.  She's riveting as ballerina Nina Sayers - the once gamine Portman is all sinew, bone and iron here.  She'll get a well-deserved Oscar nomination for sure.<br /><br />Beyond Natalie, Darren Aronofsky's casting choices are excellent.  Barbara Hershey's brittle face (the result of one-too-many scalpels) give her the perfect countenance for someone with her character's infantilizing tendencies (Nina's stuffed animal-laden bedroom is a set designer's delight).  Vincent Cassel was a dancer throughout his youth - his posture, carriage and air of authority all ring true here.  Aronofsky's choice of Winona Ryder as the soloist Portman's character is replacing is his most inspired choice (there's a whiff of Mickey Rourke in that one). Her fallen star and push from the limelight trades a bit on the public's perception of her as a fallen-from-grace starlet.  Ukraine's own Mila Kunis is good here, too - her lithe physique and hard body make her a believable threat to stand in the way of Nina's dreams.<br /><br />There's a joke here about how you get guys to attend a movie about ballet: you put Portman and Kunis in bed together.  It's that scene that have led some reviewers to call this Aronofsky's \\"psychosexual thriller.\\"  Whether that attracts the wrong type of crowd, I don't know.  But I will say that the scene isn't gratuitous.  It figures heavily in Nina's mental meltdown: did she dream that event?  Probably so, but even the audience is left not knowing for sure given Kunis' character's little head game.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Easily the biggest surprise hit of the year, THE AMERICAN isn't quite an espionage thriller (it moves far too slowly), nor is it a romance (though there is plenty of that).  It's really one man's quest for identity, set against his job as an American spy in Italy, and involving his entanglement with some local beauties (who may or may not be who they seem).<br /><br />THE AMERICAN is a mostly-foreign film that certain does not fit the expectations of many of the people who saw it (check out all the negative reviews here for proof of that).  It's a slow-burner, heightened by George Clooney's melancholy performance; he's basically channeling UP IN THE AIR's Ryan Bingham through a watered-down Seth Gecko (FROM DUSK 'TIL DAWN).  We've seen him better, but he's perfect for this role.  The ladies who surround him--names woefully unfamiliar to most of us--easily hold their own.  The entire cast provides that extra touch of reality that anchors the film and gives it that extra bit of emotional resonance.<br /><br />Anton Corbijin's directing is equally top-notch.  The problem lies in the script (I won't comment on Martin Booth's novel, as I have not read it; typically, the book is better than the film, but you know this), which moves too slowly for its own good.  Not that this is a fast-paced story, or should be; but there can be tension in emotional tales, suspense in the mundane--we don't need bullets flying around to put us on the edge of our seats.  Rowan Joffe's script doesn't give us that.  If the script had been up to par with the cast, directing, and cinematography, the film would have been a close contender for status of \\"modern classic.\\"  As is, it's above-mediocre, though it will alienate a lot of people who watch it, expecting something far different.
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|I can't comment knowledgeably on the controversy that this documentary has engendered (i.e., is it fake/contrived or not), but I can say that this is definitely a film worth seeing.  More than any other film I've seen in the last 12 months, it'll get you talking as soon as the lights go up.<br /><br />Give filmmakers Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost credit for realizing they had a pretty good story budding under their noses: Ariel's younger brother, Nev, has struck up a web-based relationship with eight-year-old 'child painting prodigy' Abby Pierce.  From there, Nev's relationship extends to others in Abby's 'family,' most notably her mother, Angela, and (cough, cough) half-sister, Megan.  It doesn't hurt that Nev's charisma and good looks are on par with any top star; nor, does it hurt that the film's producer, Andrew Jarecki (founder of Moviefone), could pass along his mastery of documentary narrative that he nailed in [[ASIN:B0000SXK0Y Capturing the Friedmans]].  But, beyond that, it's instinct and a natural curiosity that lead the older Schulman and co-director Joost to tease the story out. And, yes, in places, to force the narrative.<br /><br />At end, 'Catfish' is a very watchable look at the changing nature of identity in the age of social media and world-wide interconnectedness.

0525423273|5.0|Anna And The French Kiss is one of those rare books that has the entire package. Everything you want in a book. Great romance. Great sub-plots. Likeable male and female protagonists. Even more important, realistic male and female protagonists. Dysfunctional family. Fabulous setting. Likeable secondary characters who fit well into the plot. Even a boarding school.<br /><br />Those are all the formulaic reasons that Anna and the French Kiss is wonderful, but there's something more. Something intangible. There's just something about this book that makes you want to keep reading, then to groan, then to squeal, then to laugh, then to cry, and finally to smile. You become a part of Anna's life. It's like magic.<br /><br />I love Anna and Etienne. I love how real they feel. Anna moves to Paris scared and angry. Those feelings don't just disappear, but neither does she hide under a rock. She's funny, nice but not too nice, a good friend but capable of holding grudges...the list goes on. Etienne is a fabulous guy. He is smart, friendly, handsome but not perfectly so, flirty without being crude, scared of change. I love how they are both 3-dimensional characters. We all know that a \\"good book\\" has realistic, flawed characters, but so few get it right. Sometimes I feel like authors create this perfect person and then throw in some major shortcoming to fulfill their creative writing course formulas. Anna and Etienne (and all the other characters) feel real. They're great people with flaws that aren't huge or weird, but just the type that you or I might have. Moreoever, their flaws fit in with their personalities and the plot of the story.<br /><br />The relationship between Anna and Etienne builds slowly. Particularly because Etienne has a girlfriend. And Anna has a guy back home that she likes. The two are clearly attracted to one another, but they both toe a line of propriety...although stepping over it a few times. Throughout a lot of the book you just wonder why Etienne doesn't break up with Ellie, but that is explored too. Even if it's not the right decision, it makes perfect sense with his character. Despite the slowness of their relationship, the plot never drags. There's always something interesting happening between Anna and Etienne and Anna's life in general.<br /><br />The book is almost entirely a romance, but Anna and Etienne are far from the only characters. You have Bridge and Toph back at home. Then at SOAP, Meredith, Josh, and Rashmi. They are quick to welcome Anna into their circle. It's wonderful to read a story where the school plot isn't predominantly about the protagonist being tortured by a popular, mean girl (although there are aspects of that too). Anna, Etienne, Meredith, Josh, and Rashmi are a close group of friends; despite their internal drama, I really wish I'd found a group as cool as them when I was in high school.<br /><br />And Paris. Who doesn't love Paris? The city isn't actually as big a character as I thought it might be. The story really could have been set in any big city and have been just as interesting. But I love how Paris is used as a supporting character. The sights the characters visit, the influence of French culture. It adds to the book but never overshadows it.<br /><br />If I had any criticisms about this book, it might be the depictions of Anna and Etienne's fathers. They are depicted as one-dimensional jerks. Arguably, this is realistic because teens don't have the best perspective to view their parents as full people. But, still. So that's my only tiny criticism.<br /><br />I cannot recommend Anna and the French Kiss highly enough. It is a model for what contemporary fiction can and should be. Truly marvelous.<br /><br />Rating: 5 / 5ie, but that is explored too. Even if it's not the right decision, it makes perfect sense with his character.

B000EXDS5M|5.0|People enjoy this classic because of the remarkable relationship between Cassidy and the Kid. The story is by no means unique, so it is their interaction that draws viewers. The two, especially Cassidy, have a childlike happy relationship, without any jealousy, and they approach everything with wide-eye delight, wonderment, and fun. The Kid's girl friend is friendly to both although only intimate with the Kid, and this causes no tension. She is the mature party among the trio. All of this is subtle. If it were overplayed, it would lose its charm. Butch's and the Kid's comments on their situations, even when they are facing possible death, make them very likeable. Even the people they rob and the lawmen see them as \\"affable.\\"

Cold Irons Bound, Trying to Get to Heaven, Make you Feel My Love, songs and arrangements that show the master and genius at work.

1449389627|5.0|[Full Disclosure] . I recieved this book as part of the oreilly Blogger review program but the opinions below are entirely my own.<br />I spend the holidays reading a very interesting book, The Myths of Innovation by Scott Berkun. The Books walks us through Some of the Common Myths and why they exist.  This books walks you thru a variety of myths and explains what is behind some of the most common innovations to date.<br /><br />I will start my  thoughts with a Brilliant Observation in the Book<br /><br />\\"Myths are more satisfying to us than the truth\\".<br /><br />This statement resonated very deeply  with me . It is true that  excitement is much more  accepted than the mundane and boring, and this book provides excitement while dispelling the myths.  The Author makes a point to bring in the simple questions that are to date unanswered with the complex one and makes the reader ponder. Do we actually have a solution?.<br /><br />Berkun very brilliantly goes over events like the Newton Apple & even about mythology of various commonly used words today.  The Process of gradual addition is what has lead to a lot of major events but are these  events actually innovations or the events leading to the  final product is the actual innovation. The Author wants us to think about the difference between an innovation and just progress as usual. This is very hard in my mind but  the author does do a good of explaining the concept. The Author  wants the audience and the readers to understand clearly that innovation is not a eureka moment but rather very hard work and involves many many people and many many prior events.[[ASIN:1449389627 The Myths of Innovation]]
B002ELM5HY|5.0|I can't think why it's taken me so long to review this CD. I have no excuse.<br /><br />Every diehard Mark Knopfler fan looks forward to the newest offering from him as eagerly as Pavlov's dog drooled for food. Chatter about a project begins almost as soon as he enters the studio, if not immediately after a tour; any visit to one of several forums is all about the newest music, with much speculation over the format; instruments used; personnel; and what way Mr Knopfler will direct his music. When this album was in production in 2009, discussion reached something of a fever pitch.<br /><br />There are always those yearning for the MK of long ago, with lightning-fast licks and clever bends; the MK of recent years, however, in keeping with his gradual incarnation as an Elder Statesman of the guitar, has morphed into an introspective, subtle storyteller, with an occasional flash of the old fire. In \\"Get Lucky\\", with the exception of a couple of numbers that classify as blues, the songs are folksy, plot-driven, and with that beautiful guitar mastery of Mr Knopfler's flowing through every song.<br /><br />Beginning with the plaintive Irish flute in \\"Border Reiver\\" - an ode to a dependable, if plebian, automobile common in a past era in Great Britain - MK's reliance on his boundless realm of excellent eclectic musicians is well-served. He has, in the past, collaborated with musicians of many stamps; lately he has been exploring his Celtic roots with flutes, violins, and a lot of acoustic guitar as well. He leads a majority of the tunes with his huge stable of beautiful electric guitars, and his signature, warm, affecting touch on the strings. No one can ring out quite the effect he can elicit from a guitar; anyone at all familiar with his style can identify his contribution in any given piece of music.<br /><br />A lot of his songs on this album come from personal reflection. \\"Remembrance Day\\", which is the British name for Veterans' Day, is a haunting etude for those lost in war, chorused by children (including Mr Knopfler's daughters); \\"Before Gas And TV\\", a folk-driven sad piece, addresses the camaraderie of community before the onset of the cyber-age; \\"Piper To The End\\" was written to commemorate MK's maternal uncle, a piper in a regiment who lost his life in WWII; \\"The Car Was The One\\" speaks of his own love affair with race cars, seen through the eyes of an impressionable young man who is more taken with the car itself than the star aura of the ace driving it.<br /><br />There is no one song on this album that I could single out as a favourite; the entire album is exquisite. Those who have matured with Mark Knopfler will be rewarded by \\"Get Lucky\\". It helped me through an extremely rough patch over the past year, when I needed great music and a reliable, familiar voice to soothe my angst. Mark Knopfler is consistent in his quality and ability. He may have evolved past the days of \\"Money For Nothing\\" - he tends toward non-rock in his tours these days - but the evolution is apropos and welcome, and thankfully, he shows no sign of slowing down. So bring on the next album, Mark.

B00005JLKN|5.0|I was really impressed with this movie ever since I first saw it so I figure a review would be good. I liked all the Hannibal Films except for Mannhunter, which this film is a remake of. Mannhunter, like this was based on the original Red Dragon novel. Since Anthony Hopkins became famous for his role as Hannibal Lecter, they decided to remake Mannhunter giving the remake the original book title, sticking close to the story, again having Hopkins play his famous role as Lecter, and making it more like the classic Silence of the Lambs film, just like in the original story. I personally like this remake better and also I feel that it stays close to the book and the movie series containing Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, and Hannibal Rising. In chronological order, it's a sequel to Hannibal Rising and a prequel to Silence of the Lambs. I really liked this film not just because of Hopkins's portrayal as Hannibal, but the supporting cast did a fantastic job playing their key roles, the plot of course was great, the horror/thriller elements were definitely there, and the overall tone of the movie was all out fantastic. This film, even-though I have them all, made me really like the Hannibal character. Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes were great in this movie. Norton does great playing FBI agent Will Graham and Ralph Fiennes fits right into his role as the serial killer Francis Dolarhyde/The Red Dragon. Definitely has some gore and disturbing/sadistic fun elements as well. Another thing I really like about this film is not only does it revert back to the Silence of the Lambs theme ware basically a killer is loose and an FBI agent seeks Lecters help in identifying and capturing him, but it shows more of Hopkins in comparison to SOTL and it shows his incarceration prior to the SOTL. This film may have gotten good reception by fans, but not as good as Silence of the Lambs, but I feel in my opinion that this is my personal top favorite pick in the Hannibal saga. This is another horror/thriller I highly recommend.orror/thriller I highly recommend.

B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I saw these shows back in the day when they originally aired. My spine tingled and my hair stood on end. In these days of endless options for televised entertainment, it's hard for some (younger folks) to imagine what all the mania was about. These shows, in their entirety (all acts, commercials, etc.) really put the Beatles impact in perspective. The other acts on the bill pale in comparison to the electricity that the band generates. And it wasn't a bunch of small-time performers - Sullivan garnered the premier entertainers of the day; comedians, Broadway players and fellow musicians tried to share the stage and were simply blown away.   The video is excellent and the sound, even with the intense screaming, is very good. Loads of hits and spot on performances by the Beatles make this a thoroughly enjoyable ride. From a historical aspect, it's an invaluable document of the first crushing wave of The British Invasion and the beginning of the end of popular music as it was known at the time. A \\"really big show\\" as Ed liked to say.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|In my opinion, this is the funniest show that's ever been on television.  It gets funnier the more often you watch it.  Because you know what's coming, you start laughing before it happens.  The cast is superb.  You can't go wrong buying this show.

He was a teenager living on his own in a run-down area of Memphis, TN.  A friend takes his own son and Michael to a private school where teachers learn that while Michael had not acquired any learning skills needed to do well in a traditional school setting, but that he had latent abilities to listen and learn.  Soon after he entered his new school, a well-to-do family took him in, gave him a place to stay, and provided stability to his life, for all the right reasons...his later success in football was never a primary concern.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Touhy, a strong-willed woman who pulls Michael into her family.  Sometime later when a friend asks whether she is changing Michael's life, she answered \\"No, he's changing ours.\\"<br /><br />When asked about \\"The Blind Side\\" Michael replied that \\"It's pretty much all true, except that Mrs. Touhy didn't teach him how to play football, he already knew how to do that.\\"<br /><br />This is a heart-warming tale of what's best about the human spirit - the ability and willingness to reach out to another person in need and provide what they need.  In this case, love, stability, and support.<br /><br />This movie, based on fact, is a fantastic movie, including elements of drama, comedy, tragedy, and triumph.<br /><br />5 stars through and through!

0312600844|5.0|That's the inscription on a statue located on the university campus where the daughter of the Berglund family attends college, and it's a fitting warning for the characters in this novel.  We are introduced to a group of people that are dysfunctional, sad and emotionally stunted, and we watch in dismay as they attempt to exercise their individual right to self-determination.  For the most part, they fail miserably, but Franzen succeeds admirably.  I can think of no other writer who could make me want to read this type of a story.  Freedom is not a classic novel for the ages, but it's pretty damn good, and there are many points where I as a reader marveled at his prose.  He never tells you what to think about his characters, but it's hard not to go where he steers you.  I think this was well worth my time to read.

B000YM4I4S|4.0|While reviewing a score of one of Schumann's symphonies, Bernstein jotted across the top of the sore the question \\"Whoever said Schumann couldn't orchestrate?!?\\" I tend to agree; despite some muddy passages in the third, Schumann's orchestrations aren't that bad when the conductor pays simple attention to balance. Bernstein was able to achieve great things in Schumann without touching the score and countless others, like Dohnanyi, Zinmann, and Gardiner, have shown us that Bernstein was not alone. Of course, that isn't to say conductors, like Szell or Barenboim, who carefully edit Schumann's sometimes heavy orchestration are doing a disservice. But Mahler took things further than a simple cleaning; there are some instances, such as the great horn call in the third, that are completely overhauled, and not for the better. Some of the opening fanfares in the \\"Spring\\" symphony's slow introduction are very un-Schumannesque and I cannot help but miss the clarinets at the beginning of allegro proper in the second. While not all of Mahler's choices are winners, he does succeed in presenting Schumann with a fresh face, and much of what he does is certainly an improvement. The texture of the fourth is much lighter, and for the better, while all the scherzos have more zest and bounce to their step. In that sense, any admirer of Schumann will find this release stimulating, if not necessarily authoritative.    With that out of the way, we can now turn to the performances themselves. On their own merits, they are spectacular. Chailly was always a good conductor of sonata form, but his tenure with the Concertgebouw has made him a real master of the German core repertoire. His sense of architecture and drive is really exemplary. Take, for example, the first movement of the third. After the aforementioned horn call fiasco - Mahler has the horns muted - Chailly drives into the recapitulation with boundless energy, aided by some spectacularly deep horns and lower strings. The effect isthrilling because, as is so often the case with the heavy-footed and dynamically monotonous third, the arrival of the recapitulation is usually a non-event. Another example is Chailly's handling of the forth's first movement. Chailly woefully fails to observe the expositional repeat (is this Mahler's doing?), but justifies the choice by underlining the unique structural balance of the piece. Nor does he simply blast out the big tutti declamations as others - Levine - have done, which gives greater weight to the coda when he finally has the orchestra really play with all the stops out.    Despite this being Mahler's Schumann, Chailly is intent on brining an appropriately Mendelssohnian lightness to bear. Indeed, Schumann greatly admired, and unsuccessfully attempt to emulate, Mendelssohn. This means that passages, like the relentlessly obsessive central climax in the allegro of the second, do not become unduly heavy. The finales, in particular, sparkle with elvish charm and overflow with boundless energy.    While this certainly doesn't displace the aforementioned reference editions if only because Mahler is so hit-or-miss, the spectacular playing and unique nature of this release deserves your attention. And the first is a performance with which you can certainly live for sometime.
1932100660|5.0|A very good book, and a very clear message: You are what you eat.  This book is simply a must read for anyone who consumes food, period.    Read it or keep believing what the powerful food lobbies and pharmaceutical industries wants us to believe: That all is find and dandy with the way you eat and live as long as you pop a couple of pills and undergo surgery every once in a while, while suffering a downward spiral of life quality and lifespan.    Reading some of the comments here on Amazon of the people who gave only 1 star I can only come to the rational conclusion that they are deep deep in the pocked of the food and pharma lobbies. Just like the scientist and politics that once refuted the dangers of smoking.
B0032JTV74|5.0|I reluctantly bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend as I knew she was going to make me watch it- I wasn'y thrilled with the idea, but I hade her watch LOST, Dexter, Breaking Bad and Fringe with me (and she ended up liking them all), so I didn't really have too much to argue against. I owed it to her to at least give it a shot.    I'm glad I did. It's actually a good show. I have some nitpicks, but I have to accept the fact that it is a musical and look past them (specifically the football episode). We haven't finished the season yet, but we're halfway through. Love the dialog and characters. My only complaint isn't with the quality of the show- but the Blu-ray menu's. They take FOREVER to load. I'm sure there are tons of reviews mentioning this fact, but I still have to rant about it.    In the end, it's not too much of a hassle- just boot it up 5 minutes before you think your gonna be ready to actually watch any episodes. It's a minor inconvenience, but I'm an easy one to forgive-and-forget when it comes to little things like that. It's not enough for me to deduct a star. Although, if I could, I would deduct half of one though!
B002ZG993Q|5.0|This is an excellent, stylish thriller that doesn't scream at you but draws you in with each beautifully-shot scene. It is essentially a European film that happens to star George Clooney, who deserves kudos for delving in to this kind of material with understated ease. But that should not scare anyone who is expecting a typical Hollywood shoot-'em-all. The hero is a lot more believable than any Jason Bourne type, an assasin in the twighlight of his career, paranoid and looking for solace in the Italian countryside. I truly enjoyed this movie.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album flew under the radar for most of 2010 for me, but maybe I'm in the wrong circles. I finally heard it on NPR's 25 best songs of 2010 as voted by listeners. \\"Sigh No More\\" and \\"Little Lion Man\\" are or will be classics, and the whole album reads like poetry it's so well written. The harmonies and instruments are folksy but don't come across as hokey as \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\"; it doesn't make you want to stick a piece of grass in your mouth, crook your arm 90 degrees and swing it to and fro in front of your torso. The musicians are very talented, and the album's well produced. Would recommend to anyone with any taste in music.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I got a kindle for Christmas and needed to choose my first book to buy.  This book stuck out to me immediately because I am a mommy to a little boy named Jack.  I just had to read it.    I thought this book was amazing.  As a new mommy, it opened my eyes up to how children view this world.  Being in a room with only his ma for 5 years and then entering the crazy world we live in must be strange.  Jacks character is so fun to view the world through.  The questions he asks his mom and the way he sees things are so interesting.  It makes you wonder what we'd all be like if we weren't exposed to the cruelties of the world...  and we'd all be perfectly content without all of the \\"things\\" that are must haves in our lives today.
0061980269|5.0|A most thought provoking and relevent theme, given the conflict between ethnic groups and countries around the world today.I love the way the author has woven different ideas and life issues throughout the story, as seen through the innocent eyes of a child, and combined them together to show the reactions of ordinary people to extraordinary events. A must for all young students and should be required reading for all politicians and world leaders around the world. My thanks to Amazon for their prompt and reliable service- I am able to enjoy this book, which was delivered a week before Christmas, through the long, hot summer holidays here in Australia. Keep up the good work!

Engaging characters and story lines that just get better with each movie.
0316098337|5.0|5 year old Jack and his Ma live in one room. Jack has never known anything different; he adheres closely to their daily rituals and truly believes that the world doesn't extend outside the one room. His only view of the outside world is a skylight and he thinks everything that happens there is really just in the TV. He dreads visits from \\"Old Nick\\", the man who visits his mother, and has to hide in the wardrobe every time he comes to visit. When Jack turns five, his mother starts trying to tell him about the world, but Jack isn't sure he's ready to face it.    Just a quick warning, this book is best going into it knowing nothing more than that, and I will be including spoilers in my review.    I had two reactions to this book. I struggled with the beginning. Unlike Jack, I knew what was going on. I knew \\"Old Nick\\" had kidnapped and raped his mother, and that Jack was the product of that rape; it seemed incredibly sad to me how he simply got on with his life as though it were normal. I doubt any mother could have chosen to do anything else, there certainly isn't any sense in raising a child to be miserable, but it was hard to take. I felt stifled just thinking about the life of Jack's Ma. I must admit that I was also quite disgusted at the continuation of breast feeding, though I could see why there was no reason to actually stop.    And then they escape, and I started to appreciate the book more. For me, their integration into the real world was the interesting part. Seeing how much Jack hadn't experienced and how poorly equipped he was for the actual world was, again, heartbreaking. One of the more interesting parts of it, though, was the fact that Jack completely misses out on societal stigmas. He doesn't think it's weird that he has long hair like a girl, or that Dora is his favorite television character. He carries a pink Dora backpack and thinks nothing of it - an interesting, and I think accurate, view on how society teaches us about the differences between boys and girls.    When they emerge into the real world, it's also apparent that Jack has the adaptive ability of his age, while Ma struggles desperately to cope. Despite his confusion over separation from her, he continues to learn about the world and find his own place in it, which in contrast to the rest of the book is heartwarming and gives us hope. I loved the sections when he's with his grandparents and learning little things about the world that he likes. It's really a testimony to the power of childhood. He struggles at first, but he does realize that the outside world is a nice place - and that he can still be with his Ma in it.    Room has garnered quite a bit of attention in the press and on blogs due to its recent Booker prize nomination, so I don't think I'm adding anything new to the discussion; regardless, I would definitely recommend this book. It's dark, but not without its strands of hope.
0316017922|4.0|Outliers--like The Tipping Point and Blink before it--is a fascinating study of phenomena that we all observe but often fail to question and, therefore, do not completely understand.  Many authors provide the slew of data that he does, but without adequate illustration it is difficult to connect to their material.  Still others are great at incorporating anecdotes but do not provide adequate foundation for their conclusions.  Gladwell, however, masterfully combines research and anecdote in this examination of the factors that have shaped the success of everyone from star hockey players to industrial magnates to nuclear physicists to superstar lawyers.    From his opening salvo on opportunity to his disclosure of his own family's heritage at the end of the book, he makes the strongest case I've heard against the myth of the \\"self-made man.\\"  He describes success as being \\"grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky--but all critical to making [outliers] who they are.\\"  (To be clear, Gladwell acknowledges the necessity of hard work in achieving success, but he shows that hard work alone does not create outliers.)    To my recollection, Gladwell does not fully assert his thesis until the conclusion of the book when he wraps it all up with a pretty bow.  He establishes that, by understanding the factors that have contributed to the success of \\"outliers,\\" we can create many more math geniuses, many more Bill Gateses, and more Beatles by simply nurturing the potential that lies within every human being.    In a country that prides itself on independence and self-reliance, Gladwell's assertions are pretty revolutionary and countercultural.  In fact, those of us who are considered successful may not appreciate having our superiority questioned because it means we have to acknowledge the opportunities that were afforded us along the way.  (Gladwell includes a great example of Jeb Bush saying with a straight face that his financial and political success was due primarily to his own hard work with no acknowledgment of the obvious advantages he received as the grandson of a U.S. Senator and son of a millionaire and U.S. President.)    If I have one criticism of this book it is that I wish Gladwell had delved more into how we can proactively influence the factors of success to help more people reach their potential.  He makes recommendations here and there throughout the book, but such groundbreaking revelations warrant at least one chapter dedicated to how societal institutions (families, communities, K-12 schools, universities, government, etc.) can use this research to fortify more of their members rather than leaving success to the privileged or lucky.

B0040QYROK|5.0|I saw this film more than 30 years ago, and it did not make much sense to me.  Beyond the spectacular visual effects, the motivations of the head man and the crazy inventor simply didn't add up in a fundamental way.  With the new footage - a full 25% of the new version - it comes together to a much more coherent conclusion, so that the viewer can participate in a fantastic and complex historical document that also works as a story today.<br /><br />In terms of the immediate film experience (i.e. not the historical interest), this film is a wonderful examination of the future of the industrial city.  On one side, you find the managers and elite, who control the city with a tayloresque precision in statistics, processes, and space.  The elite (or brain or head) reserves for itself the best spaces and activities.  There is a wonderful, re-added sequence of a race between highly trained athletes, whose beautiful bodies are compared to huge statues in a stadium.  Indulging himself in unprecedented riches, the son of the leader (or dictator or CEO) of the city plays sensual games all day in an artificial garden.  On the other hand, you have the  proletariat, who work the massive underground machines and live in the bowels of the city, exhausted and downtrodden but cared for in a certain way.  They are the \\"hand\\".<br /><br />The elite boy has a life-altering encounter with a young visionary from the underground, who is preaching an overtly christian message of brotherhood.  He goes in search of her, discovering the underside of his father's empire and deems himself to be the mediator (or \\"heart\\") that the beautiful young visionary foresees as the salvation and who will change the balance of the Metropolis.  To head off what he sees as a threat to his order, the father allies himself with a fabulous inventor, who is going mad.  They develop a plan to discredit the young visionary.  The recovered footage shows that the inventor and CEO were rivals for the love of the same woman, Hel, whose death split them apart and made the inventor a hidden enemy because of his insane jealousy.  Hel was completely missing from the version released in the US and is the keystone to the entire plot.  Needless to say, the son (Hel was his mother) joins with the girl to realize her vision of a new and more just harmony.  While melodramatic as was the style of silent films, this story is wonderfully moving and thought-provoking with symbolism of both marxism and christianity but also industrial capitalism.<br /><br />In an historical sense, the film is an absolute must-see for any film buff or sci-fi enthusiast.  The scenario is probably the most influential of any futuristic vision in the history of cinema.  Not only is there a vision of cities to come that many urban planners acknowledge as an inspiration to them, but countless later films were inspired by its imagery.  You can directly compare, for example, Blade Runner or the laboratory scenes from Frankenstein to it, though they are lacking when compared to a complete picture of a possible future.  Many of the images were inspired directly from the modern art of the time, such as the robot, when compared to the sculptures of Raymond Duchamp-Villon.  Perhaps most interesting since it was made well before the rise of Hitler, you get a foretaste of what would happen in fascism - from the over-done architecture to the lines of men as they descend to work like prisoners in concentration camps.  It is a tribute to Lang's genius that so many of these images are indelibly etched on the artistic consciousness of the 20C.  Even better, with the re-added scenes the vision is far better realized than the original US release, in particular in the complete sequence of the robots transformation.  I was completely dazzled by it yet again.<br /><br />I wish to note that there are many plot subtleties re-added that improve the drama of the film, beyond the fundamental addition of Hel's presence.  For example, the dictator has an enforcer who dresses like a protestant preacher, a sinister brute in the background.  There is also the transformed man, Jahosafat, who was fired by the dictator and comes to the aid of his son.<br /><br />All in all, this is essential to any film library.  Much of the added print is crude, having been transferred from 16mm replacement prints, so viewers should not expect too much.  Finally, there is a wonderful documentary that covers not just the film itself in historical context, but tells the story of the re-discovery of the original version in Argentina.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.tor has an enforcer who dresses like a protestant preacher, a sinister brute in the background.

I also had recommended it to other readers and everyone had the same opinion-  It was boring, you could not like the characters, and what a waste of money.  I guess someone has a great PR firm.

030746363X|5.0|I am about 135 pages into The 4-Hour Body plus have read The 4-hour Work Week more than once.  I may update this review later after finishing the book but am writing a review now rather than write comments on some of the 1-star reviews.  I do not blame the one-stars as it seems expected that there will be an \\"anti\\" crowd but I think basically they are missing the point and taking the title and some of the chapter headings too literally.  Tim Ferriss has been pretty open about the titles of both books being the result of market research - that fact is part of the whole idea (minimum input for maximum result).      Like most things, the book works best when preaching to the choir.  I have long thought like Tim Ferriss but have not always acted on it.  His books motivate me to act on things I already believe to be effective.  He also has a way of simplifying things that otherwise seem complex.  One example is with the low carb diet or paleo diet.  After earlier reading I tried and achieved about 36 hours without refined carbohydrates (no flour, grain, sugar, etc.) - not much gain there.  With Ferriss' simpler approach I am about 7 days into it without any difficulty and have set higher goals for myself (why just lose weight - now I want muscle gain).     True, I do not intend to take enhancement supplements (4-hour Body topic) and do not intend to try to start a lecture circuit or internet business as a \\"muse\\" (4-hour Work Week).  But the fact that I do not expect this is no more criticism than someone saying you should not read \\"How I Play Golf\\" by Tiger Woods because it is not realistic to expect to play like Tiger Woods.  It is inspiration and interesting.

It was one evolving, involving life story of two artists that I heard of, but never paid attention to - Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe - and the cadre of people who, off and on, populated their worlds and work.  Not knowing of them, beyond shallowly, before this, was definiteley, my loss, indeed!  This is a wonderful book with depth and humor; is a biography of an era as well as of a couple.  If you are alive. can read, and have any penchant for the true life tale of artists making art, making love, making life, as you follow the paths they took, the choices they made, the people they befriended - this book is for you.    Patti Smith grabs you from the first page and never lets go.  Thank you, Patti, for bringing me along as a spectator/reader of this highly interesting life and un-put-down-able story.  A book I will always be glad I read!  She won the National Book Award, Non-fiction prize or her effort.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Every so often, I want to watch a movie that actually has some taste and quality behind it, and when I want that, who do I go to?  Well, Pixar, obviously.  But aside from Pixar, a second choice is Hiyao Miyazaki; a master filmmaker and storyteller from Japan.    Now, before I say anything else, I feel I should say that I place Miyazaki second, not because he's not a good storyteller.  In many ways, I consider him a better storyteller than anyone else in the world today.  The drawback to his movies, which always impedes my ability to enjoy them is their subject matter.    Miyazaki has a fascination with the strange and bizarre, which is no crime.  Disney does too, but where Disney focuses largely on the realm of fantasy, Miyazaki's films too often use the occult as their backbone.  Kiki's Delivery Service was about a witch, Castle in the Sky prominently featured magic crystals and spells, and most of his other films (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, etc...) are steeped in eastern mysticism and bunk spirituality if you look at them too closely.  I consider them all entertaining, and in most cases, fun romps through a welcoming fantasy land, but I hesitate to show them to children, because of the mixed messages that this kind of world view sends.    I only start out with this objection to get it out of the way, because this element is as deep in Ponyo as in any other Miyazaki film.  Magic potions of some type seem to drive the film's alpha plot, not only giving Ponyo and her father their powers to start with, but creating one of the biggest floods in history, and nearly destroying the world.  It's implied that Ponyo's father keeps these potions for constructive purposes, though, so it's not specifically \\"bad guy magic,\\" like with a character like Maleficent.  However, the worst thing is the character of Ponyo's mother.  She's a mighty, inhuman being who seems to embody and control the ocean, which I normally wouldn't have a problem with.  I'd justthink she was a superhero.  However, midway through the film, she saves a bunch of ships from sinking with her powers, and sailors on those ships not only call her a \\"goddess,\\" but begin to visibly pray to her.  Needless to say, I won't be showing this film to kids without a major footnote or something.  We frown on paganism in my family.    That having been said, as a movie, Ponyo is really quite lovely, if a bit misguided from time to time.  The background music is absolutely stunning; some of the best I've heard in any film for a long time, although the characters themselves don't sing; another typical staple of Miyazaki films.  The animation is very beautiful too, with a lot of gorgeous panoramas of harbors, undersea vistas and raging storms.    The tale involves a little, red fish, mutated by a magic potion, who gradually grows more powerful, until she decides to escape from her father; the potion-making Fujimoto.  She washes up on shore, gets caught in an old jar, and is liberated by a boy named Sosuke, who she befriends.  Eventually, Ponyo is recaptured by her father, but decides to use her magic to metamorph into a human and escape.  She accidentally absorbs her father's strongest magic potion, causing a massive flood as a result, and going to find Sosuke.  However, Ponyo is still only a little girl, and doesn't understand all the damage she's doing, which is why Fujimoto tries to track her down after this.  Eventually, he meets with her mother (the water being I mentioned earlier,) and she offers to let Ponyo remain human, if Sosuke loves her enough.    Ponyo and Sosuke need to navigate the flood she caused, but she gradually starts to lose her magic powers, and turn back into a fish.  Soon, Fujimoto shows up and takes them to meet Ponyo's mother, who says that Ponyo can remain human forever, but she has to give up her magic.  She also tells Sosuke the truth about Ponyo, and asks him if that's alright, and if he still loves her, even knowing that she's really a fish who turns into a person.  After they each make their choice, the film doesn't last much longer, but it's implied that things will eventually get back to normal.    As a story, Ponyo is told much like Spirited Away; a lot of things happening at once, and hardly ever are real explanations given for them.  The audience needs to figure certain things out for themselves as the film progresses, and the potential for confusion is high, but in a way, all that does is change the tone of the film to less of a storytelling vehicle, and more of a piece of artwork.  Unlike Spirited Away, this film impressed me with its dazzling sights and beautiful music, and that's a strong word in its favor already; especially when the film specifically makes that it's point.    Ponyo herself is an unusual character.  In a certain sense, she's shrill and often foolishly endangering people.  Bottomlessly selfish in her quest to get her way, and frankly, I don't find her all that cute, though she does sometimes like to help people when she thinks she can without sacrificing her dreams.  Thanks largely to that, I didn't find her a detriment to the movie either.  As a character, she's pretty basic and believable, and she brings out the best in her co-star Sosuke; a nice, responsible little boy who helps out his mother.    Fujimoto left an impression on me too.  He's not menacing in any sense, in spite of his powers, and often, he even comes across as just foolish and inept.  However, he's also not really all that villainous, though he does express a desire to see \\"the human race\\" brought to heel at one point.  Aside from abducting his own daughter and imprisoning her in a bubble for being young and foolish, he doesn't really do anything bad, and his status as a bit of a bumbler makes him a sympathetic character as well, though it does mean that this movie lacks a real antagonist, unless you count Ponyo herself.    My overall impression of this interplay of the characters within the setting of the story was more like an impressionist painting than a fairy tale.  Rather that being clear or direct with its plot points, or trying to tell you about what's actually going on in Ponyo's world, and what kind of adventure she's having, the film spends lots of time instead trying to be beautiful and inspire awe with its sound and visuals, and I certainly will not claim that's not a valid way to do things.  In a sense, I found it refreshing.    When it comes to the messages that this film delivers, I admit that it was hard to find one that really stood out.  I've been told that environmentalism is present in this movie, but I just don't see it.  The environment is beautifully-rendered, but barely features into the plot itself; it's a film about magical creatures interacting with normal people.  I guess you could say that the message is something like \\"don't mess around with magic potions.  Somebody always gets hurt.\\"    However, in addition to this central message, there are also others; messages about family, about commitments made to the people you love, and how important it is to do our best to fulfill them, and to not torture ourselves when the option is taken out of our hands.  They're all subtly-delivered, but they're all there.  That having been said, I only have one more thing to bring up.    Near the end, when Sosuke is approached by Ponyo's mother, she explains to him that Ponyo was a fish who turned into a human, and wanted to know if Sosuke still loved and accepted her, even knowing that.  Two questions are hidden here; does Sosuke like Ponyo as a person; and not just because of her magic?  Furthermore, can Sosuke continue to love Ponyo, even though she's not of the same race as him?  This subtle question about racism was very well-delivered in the Japanese subtitled version of this film, though I'm afraid the delivery was a bit less artfully done in the english dub.  You see, the phrase they used was \\"accept you as you are,\\" while in the Japanese,it was something like \\"Love and accept Ponyo for what she truly is.\\"  I need to say that I prefer the more direct translation.  Why even bring this up?  Well...    The problem is, America is a cultural warzone right now, and a lot of terms and expressions have been co-opted by one ideology or another to serve their nefarious ends.  At the moment, \\"accept you as you are\\" is a very loaded term, and has connotations in America which are just as negative as calling Ponyo a \\"comrade.\\"  I only bring this up to be thorough, however, and because it slightly impeded my enjoyment of the film when I watched it in English.    Lastly, I feel I would be remiss if I didn't mention the remix of the ending theme that was done by the english dub, which is in a very different music style, and is much more discordant than the original Japanese version (which is also included, if you want to watch it with subtitles.)  I didn't think it was a movie-destroying problem, but I know fans of the original would want me to at least bring it up.    For all my complaining, though, my overall impressions of the film were very enjoyable and positive.  I can't give it a perfect grade, but it was a very good film, and when I have a couple hours to myself, with not much else to do, I may just decide to go swimming with Ponyo again.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|\\"The Expendables\\" (2010) should have been mindless \\"B-movie\\" fun. Unfortunately, Sylvester Stallone torpedoes the star-studded enterprise with his turgid script and plodding direction. \\"Rambo\\" was no masterpiece, yet Stallone kept things moving. Apart from a few impressive action scenes, nothing clicks here - even the brief summit meeting of Sly, Arnold and Bruce falls flat. Better luck next time.
0393061310|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of all of Jared Diamond's books, but this one and Collapse are my two favorite non-fiction books of all time. Guns, Germs... does more to explain why the world is the way it is than anything else I have ever read.
0399226907|5.0|I remember reading this book as a kid, so it was the first book I ever bought for my kid.  It's a simple story, and if you're in a hurry, you can read it fairly quickly - great for kids learning to read, too.<br /><br />But if you have some time, this book can take a very long time to read, as you point out the details on every page.  You can explore the holes, look for the caterpillar as he eats his way through food, and make up additional details about the food.
B000MKIR80|4.0|Woody Allen shoots Scarlett Johansson being cute.  This is not a plot driven movie, but relies almost entirely on the friendship and banter between Scarlett's and Woody's characters.  Minimalist and straightforward, this film is shot in the vein of his comedies from the last 10 years.     Take away: slow fade-in/ fade-out of a ghost, is still very effective    If this movie were a meal it would be: celery with too much dip.    Best word from the movie: Woody Allen: \\"...prestidigitator...\\"
B0012GVKVY|5.0|The pictures are detailed and sharp throughout. The dialog, background music, and sound effects (e.g., explosions, physical damage, glass breaking, robot movement) are precise and very clear. The usage of surround speakers is as good as any modern action film.<br /><br />The story line itself is pretty engaging. Good plot. There is some parallels with Star Trek TNG (Data), the good robot goes through self reasoning, realization, and evolve toward better side of humanity. The threats faced humanity from the computer \\"conscience\\" is repeated many times in previous movies, including the likes of \\"War Games\\" from the 80s, and the entire Terminator series.

So for a photo enthusiast, it is big enough. But be ware, the padding inside the bag is not as good as other professional camera bag and it is not weather resistant, so I would rather take more professional bag if going for hiking, I use it when I'm around cities.

B0000041TD|5.0|Years ago, a friend who had majored in opera, dropped this on my desk. I had talked with him about opera, and had expressed some curiosity about it. He was nice enough to surprise me with this, and said, \\"Just listen to this.\\" I had no idea what to expect. I took it home, and began listening to the first act. I remember thinking that Pavarotti's solo, \\"Che Gelida Manina,\\" was one of the most beautiful things I had ever heard. Then, he and Mirella Freni end the first act from the wings of the stage singing \\"Amore.\\" It's stunning. Moving. Emotionally draining. Then Pavarotti hits a high-C, and my jaw literally dropped. I played it over again. I got my wife to come in the room to listen. I was just overcome by how incredibly beautiful this music was, sung by these two artists.    I went back to work the next day and found the friend who had given me the CD set. I gushed a thank-you, and I mentioned the high-C at the end of the first Act. My friend smiled and said, \\"The tenor's score doesn't actually have that in it. It's a lower note. But the good ones -- the virtuosi -- sing it, if they can.\\" Of course, that simply made the recording that much better for me. It was a moment in time when Pavarotti and Freni were at their artistic zenith. When they could do things with their voices that others simply couldn't.     I listened to it again tonight after not doing so in about a year, and, again, I was just amazed and overcome by the beauty of the music. Just listen to it and you'll see what I mean.
0307408833|1.0|Items marketing themselves as healthy should not contain large quanities of frutose, see the except from an article by Dr Mercola about the dangers of Agave:     \\"Most agave \\"nectar\\" or agave \\"syrup\\" is nothing more than a laboratory-generated super-condensed fructose syrup, devoid of virtually all nutrient value, and offering you metabolic misfortune in its place.     Unfortunately, masterful marketing has resulted in the astronomical popularity of agave syrup among people who believe they are doing their health a favor by avoiding refined sugars like high fructose corn syrup(HFCS), and dangerous artificial sweeteners.     And if you're diabetic, you've been especially targeted and told this is simply the best thing for you since locally grown organic lettuce, that it's \\"diabetic friendly,\\" has a \\"low glycemic index\\" and doesn't spike your blood sugar.     While agave syrup does have a low-glycemic index, so does antifreeze -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.     Most agave syrup has a higher fructose content than any commercial sweetener -- ranging from 55 to 97 percent, depending on the brand, which is FAR HIGHER than high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which averages 55 percent.     This makes agave actually WORSE than HFCS.     It is important to understand that fructose does not increase insulin levels, which is not necessarily good as what it does do is radically increase insulin resistance, which is FAR more dangerous. You see, it's okay for your insulin levels to rise, that is normal. You just don't want these insulin levels to remain elevated, which is what insulin resistance causes.     That is why fasting insulin is such a powerful test, as it is a very powerful reflection of your insulin resistance.     In addition to insulin resistance, your risk of liver damage increases, along with triglycerides and a whole host of other health problems, as discussed in this \\"CBC News video about the newly discovered dangers of high fructose corn syrup\\". The study discussed in this news report is about HFCS, however, it's well worth remembering that agave contains MORE fructose than HFCS, and in all likelihood, it's the FRUCTOSE that is causing these severe liver problems.\\"
0385342047|2.0|So we've read enough Becky Bloomwood by now to know that she's got a spending problem and things usually work out in the end, right?  She's one of those maddening people who screw up royally and still end up in a better position than they were at the beginning.  But I think this is the last Shopaholic book I'll read, unless I hear that there's something extraordinarily new in the next one.  I love Sophie Kinsella/Madeline Wickham, but this was just too much of the same old, same old.  With the title, I had expected maybe more about Becky's relationship with her daughter, but it seemed that poor Minnie was just a prop, put there to shine the light on more Becky-shopping, and Becky/Luke drama, etc.  I particularly didn't like Luke in this book.  He's distant at best throughout the whole thing; wooing new clients, taking care of work, saving the Bank of London.  But towards the end we realize that Luke is hesitant to have a second child because he loves Minnie so much, he doesn't think he can share that love with another child, and he doesn't want that child to feel abandoned like his mother made him feel.  Well, the thing is, Luke, I would find that believable if you showed a modicum of interest in Minnie other than how poorly she behaves.  Luke does not seem to make his family a priority at all, and is rarely seen interacting with Minnie.<br /><br />This series should have ended already.  Bummer, because I have really good memories of Becky when I was 24 and in credit card debt myself.  Maybe that's the thing - I did a budget, pared down, stopped shopping and basically grew up.  I wish Becky would do the same.  If she refuses to, I just can't be friends with her anymore.  It's that simple.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I received my copy from Amazon when it was released.  I had my reservations about this movie because I hadn't really heard anything about it other than the previews on television but I purchased it anyway because I like Angelina Jolie.    Anyway, I sat down on a rainy night and decided to watch this movie.  All I can say is WOW!  It was pure action for 55 minutes out of the 104 minutes of the movie.    For you nit pickers out there some details were a little skecthy and may cause you to question accuracy.  However, remember it's only a movie for entertainment purposes not a documentary to provide facts.  In other words just sit back enjoy the movie.

B00428CPUY|1.0|The poor rating is not for the music but for the quality of the discs. For $21.95 it was a disappointment.I had to return the discs because of the quality.  I am hoping that the replacement discs are an improvement. There were skips, pauses, and several of the titles listed on the cover are totally missing. We had seen the concert in the theater (a one time special showing) and it was wonderful.

B003NX6ZDC|3.0|The impulse to compare \\"Flamingo\\" to The Killers' albums is understandable, but is somewhat unwarranted, since this isn't supposed to be a Killers album. Comparisons of \\"Flamingo\\" to the Killers will ultimately be a waste of time because they are comparisons of music made by four men, to music made by only one of those four men. If you take a musical quartet and remove (or replace) three of the members, you shouldn't expect the same sort of result. What this album shows us is that Brandon Flowers is not the The Killers; it's not Brandon and his backing band. Before hearing this album, I believed that Brandon Flowers was what made the Killers, and that \\"Flamingo\\" would be, essentially, another Killers album. I was wrong.    Personally, I did enjoy this album. By no stretch of the imagination can it be placed on an equal level with the albums of the Killers, but that is not immediate grounds for condemning it. Placed next to \\"Hot Fuss,\\" it's rather weak, but placed next to most other pop/rock albums produced in 2010, it stands up rather well. If, while listening to \\"Flamingo,\\" you are constantly comparing it to the Killers, you probably won't enjoy it very much, and will be missing out on what good can be had from it.
B000W93CHC|3.0|Mr. Follet continues his bothersome habit of incorporating contemporary slang in a novel about the 14th century.  It is disconcerting to say the least.  He should also learn the difference between the words farther and further.  His atheism is on full display in this novel and that becomes a downright bore.    Aside from that the book has some interesting characters; although I almost expected Caris to cure cancer by the end of the book and Merthin clearly was able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.  The story was engaging if a bit lengthy.    All in all, this effort by Mr. Follet is \\"OK\\"[[ASIN:B000W93CHC World Without End]]

B00000E3HM|5.0|My favourite observation about Karajan comes from his time in London when Sir Thomas Beecham dubbed him 'a kind of musical Malcolm Sargeant'. Bitchy, yes, double-edged and incomparably witty, but there's more than an element of truth in it; Karajan was interested in self-promotion and appearance for sure, but beneath that was a love of music and gift for its realization developed over decades of hard work, coupled with a huge technical facility and a Toscanini-like memory. He also had an eye for the future and his own recorded immortality. Like Mr Pappolino, I'd have to say that Furtwangler's best records move me more; but nowhere, based on the recorded evidence, is there a legacy like Karajan's. You may hate the idea of him and object to his approach, but the fact is that he produced more great records from more diverse composers than any other conductor: Mozart, Beethoven, Bruckner, Brahms, Verdi, Puccini, Tchaikovsky, Ravel, Sibelius, Schonberg to name but a few. And yes, it's all marked, as Mr Pappolino points out, by a concern for beauty. Perhaps Leonard Bernstein gets close to K's achievement in some ways, though the quality of his legacy is hugely more variable. What's more, considering the conditions which obtain in music today, nobody else is likely to 'beat' this phenomenal achievement. It doesn't always work for individual listeners, but the body of work is impossible to dismiss. There are many Karajan myths, but he was a complex, hugely-gifted man, so it's better not to buy into any of them.<br /><br />It's well-known that he came to Mahler late, like Furtwangler, who played three of the symphonies in Berlin in the 1920s but only chose to record some of the songs, which he, like me, felt contained the best of this composer's output. My feeling is that, for whatever reason, Karajan didn't much *like* Mahler either.<br />Now, Karajan's approach, for me, doesn't work too well in his realizations of symphonies 5&6, although the slow movement of the latter is incomparably done. Either of his celebrated Ninths leave me cold personally, but this recording is beautifully-realized; yes, it has lush sound and some thick textures but there's also a deep feeling for this most 'Austrian' of Mahler symphonies. The first movements have an openness and joy which is very special and the Ruhevoll is raptly-beautiful in a way, again, which won't suit everybody; but string ensemble playing of this quality is very rare. Edith Mathis is wonderful in the finale too.<br />This is a five-star disc, no doubt. If Mahler's your thing then I also recommend Szell and Tennstedt which are both favourably-priced and will satisfy many who feel they're 'allergic' to Karajan. But if Mahler isn't particularly your thing and beauty of sound is a first concern, then this record may be all you want.y done.

B000HT3Q3M|5.0|I happened to be searching for lyrics by Al Jarreau during this past Holiday Season and just happened to find this CD in the process. I have been a fan of BOTH Al Jarreau and George Benson for several years but did not know this project had been on the market for some time. (I had serious illness in my family in 2006 therefore missed the CD news release). When I heard the snippets from this release I knew that THIS CD would be my own personal Christmas gift for me. I have had one of the best Christmases in a while just listening to all the songs that George and Al masterfully exhibited. Their intercharge by way of Al's fabulous voice and George's intensely soulful strums on the guitar are purely intoxicating! I later read this was a Grammy Award-Winning CD of which is NO surprise. If you love either Artist you will LOVE this CD!

B004E3XD1W|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. If you like strong female character then you'll like Katsa and her adventures. But BE AWARE! the ending is diffent from other books I've read!<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />I'm all for independence and respect Katsa's choice about no marriage and no children, but don't understand it! I do have to agree with one the review that it sounds more selfish than anything else. True she's a strong independent woman but Po was her wickness. True she was young at age but she was a mature woman. True Po was her first \\"relationship\\" but after all they been through together there was no way it could have ended the way it did.<br /><br />Call me a fool or crazy or a romantic if you will! but when you love somebody you want to be with that person! I didn't need the And They Live Happily Ever After, just wish the author would be more specific about what will happen to them. It's as if... they are together now, but maybe not later...type of thing.<br /><br />I was hoping that Katsa would change her mind about things, but no. And when the end of the book came, it just ended! left me unsatisfied and irritated. What will become of Katsa and Po relationship? I guess use your imagination. Now I don't lack of imagination but I wanted closure.<br /><br />But overall this was a great book!
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Like the summary states this is a story of two writers, one young and one old.  the older one, Miss Winters, is telling her life story to the younger one, Margaret, and through the telling they both change.    This is a story within a story that begins with the premise \\"Tell me the truth\\" and then proceeds to do so in a brutal way.  I wanted to give it 5 stars because it was so fascinating that once I got into it I couldn't put it down, but it wasn't as good as others I've given 5 stars.  I would give it 4-1/2 stars because it was good, not five because I don't know if I would read it more than twice.  It is part mystery, part love story, and part shocker, and all parts combine to make a great story. You are first confused and then shocked and then confused more until it all comes together and is explained.    *SPOILER*    This is appropriately named as the thirteenth tale for you learn at the end that Ms Winter's story was the thirteenth tale in her original book.  The finding this out is not a shock, but finding out what that tale is.  Her tale is but the sub-plot in the life of the family of Angelfield, and a sad one at that.  The story contained shocking tales of violence and rape, but while in themselves this is shocking they just added spice to the story of a family gone mad.  There are deaths and murders, but central to the story is how Ms Winter rose from the ashes of their madness to become a great storyteller.    In the end you come to understand the power of change and desperation which made Ms Winters the person she became.  While she changes, the greatest change occurs in Margaret as she breaks free of her family and becomes a person in her own right. I am not sure I liked the ending, but it did fit well.  Why will I reread it only once...because I don't know if I could stand to revisit the horrors in the story more than once without being changed.  And yet it has already affected me so I long to revisit it to see if what I took from the book was true.What can I say but what I have already told my friends with whom I share books...READ IT.  It is a book you want to reserve for a weekend where you have the time to read it all.  It has mystery and suspense, with just a touch of romance.  I would avoid it if you have a weak stomach for parts of the book is very graphic and some of the relationships are very twisted. But in the end you understand why she wrote the first book and why all of her life she chose to tell no one who she was. I liked Margaret and how she grew through the course of the book, but it was Ms Winters who won my admiration for taking such a bad upbringing and becoming the woman she was.    Read it, I promise it will change the way you look at things and I promise you will either love it or hate it because such a powerful story leaves no room for weaker feelings.

0859533263|5.0|I was first introduced to this book after checking it out from my local library.  It immediately became a favorite book for my then 15 month old son, so much so that I reached my renewal limit with it and had to regretfully return it to the library.  With Christmas coming up, I knew what would be going under the tree for my son.  The look on his face when he unwrapped it was priceless.  It was like he was seeing an old friend.  We read, well actually sing, this book at least a few times every day.  My son loves the singing, and I love that there is so much to be seen and discussed on each page. This book has bright, vibrant colors, is very sturdy (though heavy for a little one), and is endlessly entertaining.  I highly recommend this book for anyone with young children, i.e. grandparents, parents, daycare, doctor's offices, etc.  It is truly a classic!

0439023513|4.0|Often I wait to find books at the library or for my turn to come up on PaperbackSwap, but once in a while I treat myself to a brand new book. Last year I bought one to take on vacation with me and I decided to do the same this year as well and this was my selection. It took me longer to read than the other two but I didn't have a whole lot of free time to read. While we were on the beach I was playing or watching my children so I didn't even take it along with me. I found myself having trouble remembering the other tributes who were in the Quarter Quell when the rescue took place. I think part of the issue is the way each of names was unique, a variation of a name we might use but twisted in some way.<br /><br />This time I was back to having questions as I read. I wondered how like the capitol District 13 was with their daily schedules tattooed on their arms and the food rationed down by weight and activity level. How nutrition was just enough to keep them going but never any extra. Especially the questions about how ethical different weapons or tactics would be, with the argument that the capitol wouldn't hesitate risk innocent lives so should they as the rebellion be concerned about it.<br /><br />I think if I had it to do over again I would love to read the books back to back. I now can't decide if I should hold onto this one or pass it along in some way. While I would like to reread them all the other two I borrowed from the library and my free time for reading has really dwindled down. I now hesitate about rereading a book, even if I loved it, because I might miss the chance to read something new.<br /><br />I was content with the conclusion of the story but don't want to reveal it so I don't ruin the book for anyone else. I am not sure I would have made the choice she made between Peeta and Gale but it did seem to end up being the best choice in the end.
B002KH4KSY|1.0|This has to one the worst made for TV movie I've seen, never mind it was a remake of a Stephen King Classic. The lead actress really overacted her part, but I really can't blame her with the script she took her lines from. The children aren't even in the least bit scary and the little boy who played Issac recites his lines like he's still trying to remember them. There is absolutely no atmosphere, eeriness or creepiness which the original movie had an abundance of. This version is stale and falls flat on its face. The male lead is the only one who is even slightly believable. Who wrote the script? I had to keep asking myself did they write this for adults.
B004498KPU|2.0|I see no need for a long, impressive review here. I have 2 BIG complaints about this collection. #1 The full version of Ghost is not in this collection. It is some poor montage of the full version. If you never saw the original it would make no sense. Also, just like the MJ dance game, they used the LP version, not the video remix. #2 I have other MJ DVD's and many have poor editing quality and menus that don't work. The same on this set. The biggest pain being this is one of those DVD's that do not let you fast forward or rewind. You are forced to watch the video through completely. No skipping stuff you don't want to see, or rewinding your favorite part. I just wanted all MJ's videos, full and unedited, menus that work, good quality, and use of the simple RW and FF funtion. Seems simple enough. I also want the Victory Tour released.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|I read the book in one day - so yes, it is pretty engaging. Anyway - i wouldn't bother to waste more time on it. Reading this crap i couldn't help thinking of Harry Potter even though both principal caracters can't in terms of ethical and moral attitude be more different. This means Harry being the literal incarnation of high moral standards as friendship, family etc, while Katniss - and this is what most upset me about the book - has absolutly no moral. She has not much of a choice - still is ok with all the decadent comfort and the show (which btw reminds me to american idol or whatever endemol stuff) and ultimately with killing. Her first-ever kill is indeed questioned -in about two frases! Never again mentioned is Peetas stabbing or slicing of a girl. A morally-sane human being would and should shatter.    I would give my kids rather crime and punishment than this so they get don't get the wrong standards about killing.

I don't expect to see amazing results from this but is very good for when I am crunched for time and need to make very second count!

B003YFIUW8|5.0|Easy to read, never got bored, read the whole thing in 2 days, it is written beautifully. I really enjoyed the story coming from Jack's perspective (5 years old), don't let the first 5-10 pages fool you, Jack really pulls you in and you find yourself remembering how you once used to think the say way as a child. This book was different because of the way it was written and I really enjoyed it. My only complaint is that the book was too short!

I could never keep it straight... you never got into any one particular character. I kept reading thinking it would get better... uggg. I have never in my life returned a book after reading it... but after wasting 6+ hours of my life reading this I wanted my money back.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I received the 2-Disc DVD set for Christmas this year.<br />The plot was faced-paced and the scenes action packed.<br />Five stars. Robert Downey Jr. could read excerpts of<br />the phone book and I'd be mesmerized. I adore him. Fans<br />of this dark-eyed, soulful man will not be disappointed.<br />As a personal aside, I would have rather seen someone<br />else play the Pepper Potts role, but that is because I'm<br />not a Paltrow fan.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|What makes life wonderful is when someone blossoms into a true artist. I put this on and couldn't stop listening to it.  The beats, the production are frankly what's missing in today's music. This stuff is off the fosheizie.    To release an album of this magnitude and nature in a year of pop trends and top 40 hits marks the courage  of a true visionary. Thank you Eminem for creating an album that made me fall in love with hip hop all over again.  This will stand the time as one of the greatest albums of all time.. no doubt!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Not his best, I did not enjoy the ghost aspect of Jo at the end. Jo was my favorie character and I didn't appreciate them going 'Oh yeah.... she's not real.' Really? I thought Kevin's character was too over the top for my taste and needed to be toned down. I did although enjoy the suspenseful ending and the orginal mystery of Katie. I would definitely recommend The Lucky One or The Last Song over this.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I was very satisfied with the clarity and picture of this movie in blu-ray.  Im sure there enough reviews explaining how amazing this movie is and how its a instant classic.  I don't care if its a mix of fern gully, dances with wolves and a few other story lines but a good movie is a good movie.  Worth a watch from everyone.  Now if these money hungry companies like Panasonic would not claim 3D Avatar for themselves.. we could see this movie how its supposed to be
0671027344|5.0|i never rate books but this was one of those books that just changed me and got me to see the good in the world again
B001GCUO16|2.0|This was probably the weakest of all the X Men movies. I do not hate this movie like say Spider Man 3 but still it's not good. Directed by Gavin Hood stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth, Danny Huston as Colonel William Stryker, Taylor Kitsch as Gambit & Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox. I 'm going to be honest this movie has a lot of problems. Like Wolverine & Sabertooth are brothers. Basically they join Team X & later due to questionable actions & disregard for human life Wolverine leaves moves to Canada goes under the name Logan he's lived there for 6 years with his girlfriend Kayla. Colonel Stryker tells him that people are killing members of Team X ok this could be like a Commando version of X Men. Kayla is murdered by Sabertooth Wolverine gets pwnd by Sabertooth & he's offered a way to beat him to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium. Logan overhears Stryker say erase his memory. Wolverine fights his way out & hides at a farm. Stryker has his men track him down they kill the owners of the farm. Then were introduced to Remy LeBeau or Gambit he mangles to convalesce him to take him to Stryker's main headquarters at 3 Mile Island. There Wolverine finds out Kayla wasn't killed she's been working with Stryker all along so he will release his sister. It has too many problems the stuff with Wolverine & Sabertooth being brothers wasn't needed cause all we need to know is they have this history they hate each other. Wolverine's woman working with Stryker it was 1 of those left feild things but it just didn't work for a movie. The PG 13 rating didn't help cause in Wolverine's past it's dark & violent it should've been rated R. The CGI for the claws look so fake. CGI or pactical effects when the claws came out in the other 3 movies it looked good. Wolverine losing his memory by an adamantium bullet is lazy script writing. Deadpool looks like Baraka from the MK games. I liked some of the action it has some ok fights. Gavin Hood wasn't the best choice for this movie maybe Bryan Synger could've done a better I don't know but Hood isn't capeable. Hugh Jackman was good. Danny Huston was a bad choice I'd rather had Brian Cox come back. Liev Schtaiber I didn't care for. Lynn Collins was ok. Taylor Kitsch was ok as Gambit but they should've done a better job I mean 4 movies & this was it. There going to do a 2nd Wolverine movie I hope 20th Century Fux are far away from it & it's R rated. I'm not looking forward to The 1st Class mostly cause I'm not a fan of prequels. I'd say rent it to see if you like it.

B002JWD6AS|4.0|What I love most about this story is the language style. It's beautiful, to say the least, and I found it most difficult to put my kindle down. The plot itself is very appealing; completely refreshing from the Twilight-fan-craze, and the characters seem well-developed.    Despite all this, I did have a couple of nags.   One is near the beginning, when Grace stops the hunters by declaring that her friend is out in the woods somewhere taking photographs. Shouldn't that sort of thing have been cleared up by the officer? Shouldn't he have asked anyone if they had seen the girl inside? Searched for her to make sure she hadn't gotten shot? Heck, asked Grace what her name was? (I don't remember him asking Grace for a name, but if he did please just disregard that last one.)  I'm not experienced in these sort of matters of course, it just seemed kind of bothersome from my viewpoint.     The other thing that bothered me was how the father had left a supposedly dead wolf (Shelby) out on the back deck.  This wolf that attacked Grace and Sam, resulting in them getting standard shots for rabies.  Would it not have also been standard for animal control to have wanted to confiscate the body for testing? I know the Dad said he assumed his wife or Grace had dropped it off some place, but it sounded more like a casual thing instead of going by procedure of animal control. I was surprised when the author didn't have them more involved.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Definitely a must for everyone, even people who do not like pop that much, especially dance pop, because there are definitely deep messages and great lyrics that can affect anybody. It's very easy to relate to some subjects Gaga writes about and in an innovative, unique and very personal way.    The Fame Monster can be treated as an evolution of Lady Gaga. She had this strategy in her mind, putting out in The Fame her unique (but restrictedly) and the most catchy songs she had written in the previous years. Then, after she had gained her so desired fame, in the sense of getting her music out so that people would know her better and be prepared for the best Gaga, she put out The Fame Monster, which, though it still had the strong bits and dance thing on, was a much more personal album, being shorter however. Gaga went slowly, playing the easier songs first and then introducing the harsher ones after the audience was prepared for them. And, as the publicity for Born This Way (the new album to be released in late May 2011) gets wider, we can see she has had the purest Gaga right in her pocket all the way through her year and a half world tour (she has mentioned in several interviews that her new album was 'pretty much finished' since August or so).  I have to admit my favorite songs are from The Fame Monster, including her great collaboration with Beyoncé in Telephone, because I feel like, as I've mentioned, the tracks get much more personal and auto-biographical than in The Fame (Speechless is an amazing ballad Gaga wrote when she was on the road and desperately wanted her father to have the heart surgery he needed - although the original lyrics were changed to not so personal meanings, still leaving the melody intact). And taking in the difference between The Fame and The Fame Monster, Lady Gaga gave us the clue we needed to understand how big Born This Way will be.

0439023491|5.0|I'm not going to waste your time reviewing the plot of the book.  You can get that from the Amazon site.  What I am going to tell you is I could not put this book down.  It's gripping right from the start and had me thinking for days.  I finished all 3 books in under a week.  I was captivated by the story.  I'm a first born eldest female, so I could identify with the main character- her protective instincts for her younger sister, etc.  I'm willing to bet most people could identify with one of the characters in the book, in which are thoroughly developed.  This book isn't for the squeamish.  The concept is truly thought provoking, that leads to underlying tones of political metaphors throughout all 3 books.  If you're willing to open your mind and allow yourself to be a little vulnerable with a concept you would never want to think about in a million years, this book is for you.  If you need a happy ending, and hate anything that differs from this norm, don't bother with this book.  It's not cheerful, harmonious, or follow basic plot stories.  It's truly going to stir up uncomfortable emotions and feelings.  At least it did for me, and I loved every minute of it.

0439023513|5.0|First of all, I don't know why this book didn't get as good of reviews as the other two.  IT DOESN'T FLOP.  The conclusion of this triology is wonderful.  If you've read the other two, of course you have to finish!!  Don't be put off by the negative reviews.  It ends perfectly.  It's not the happiest of endings, but really, were you expecting it to be?  This book is just as fast past as the first two, although I admit the first was my favorite.  If you're like me and couldn't put the first two down, then everything will be fresh in your mind as this book alludes to the previous two quite often.  Thought provoking to the end.

Of the famous cover photograph for \\"Horses,\\" Patti writes, \\"When I look at it now, I never see me. I see us.\\"    Her eulogy for their partnership is composed of deceptively simple, amazingly precise, and slowly rhythmic sentences. It's a prose chock-full of mundane details and also suffused, at the end--when she's walking on a stark, windy beach in a whipping black coat--with a gentle spiritual force.      Her book is so beautifully crafted, so expertly edited...I am so happy for her! And I am still crying.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Issued as a respone to the \\"Alpha and Omega\\" bootleg Beatles album (it also had four solo tracks as well from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison)which featured a total of 30 songs from throughout the band's career (and sold via a direct marketing on TV)in 1972, the \\"Red\\" album features 26 tracks on 2 CDs highlighting some of The Beatles biggest selling and best singles (the \\"Blue\\" album for those who don't know collects 28 tracks from the remainder of their career).<br /><br />Remastered by the same Abbey Road team that did The Beatles remasters in 9/09, the \\"Red\\" collection sounds surprisingly good. Yes, there was limiting applied and some mild compression (it was a compromise to give the albums a more \\"modern\\" sound)but these DO sound better than most remasters/reissues coming out now. The packaging mimics the original packaging from 1973 with a gatefold sleeve that houses the CDs and a booklet. It's not exactly like the original album cover of course but very close. \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" still has the alteration to the opening chord due to the mastering that is on the stereo \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" album. It's not clear if the original mastertape was damaged or if the team thought it was damaged and tried to \\"fix\\" it but it sounds slightly different than the original. You can listen to samples here to compare them or to the mp3 file via mp3 downloads at amazon.<br /><br />Some tracks are also presented here in mono because there aren't any \\"true\\" stereo remaining mastertapes for the team to work from on these few tracks. Fans will feel one of two ways about the mono stuff--some grew up on the the duophonic stereo mixes on the original Capital releases and may prefer those or there will be some purists that feel that these should be in mono anyway (and they probably have \\"The Beatles in Mono\\" box set anyway). Just be aware that a few of the tracks here do not exist in stereo and the original mastertapes are long gone which is why they included the mono versions here.<br /><br />\\"Help!\\" as was mentioned by some other reviewers does not have the James Bond intro but that can be had on [[ASIN:B000EQHXQ4 The Capitol Albums Vol. 2 (Brick)]].

0316069485|5.0|Author Michael Connelly is best known for his superb Harry Bosch series, and in the past few years, has added another character to his body of work, that of brash, unconventional defense attorney Mickey Haller. Connelly is now at the point where he can combine and reshuffle characters from each series, creating a familiar community of pros devoted to pursuing justice in Los Angeles. I've enjoyed each and every one of the books that came before The Reversal, and now, without hesitation, can say that this is Connelly's best ever. It's unusual for a writer to be so capable of keeping a long series so fresh, but this guy seems to do that effortlessly, demonstrating the hallmark of a master.<br /><br />In The Reversal, Mickey Haller is tapped by the DA to handle the prosecution of Jason Jessup, whose 25-year-old conviction for the murder of a little girl has been overturned using DNA evidence. Haller is the consummate defender of the underdog, and it is with trepidation that he accepts this challenge, mainly because he is so certain of Jessup's guilt. He requests the services of his ex wife, Maggie \\"McFierce\\", a consummate prosecutor, and of Harry Bosch, the best investigator he knows.<br /><br />The Reversal is a tale told in two threads, that of Haller's construction of the legal case, and that of Bosch's field work. They are opposed by a particularly wily defense lawyer, who is determined that his client go free. As it becomes clear that Jessup is probably a serial killer, the tension mounts, along with the pressure to stop this man once and for all. What unfolds is a chess game in which neither side can ever count on achieving checkmate. By the time all is said and done, it's difficult to distinguish a winner, though losers abound.<br /><br />Bottom line: you'll have to search hard and long for a writer who can do police precedural and courtroom drama on the level that Connelly has achieved. The Reversal is top notch.

B0041KKYEW|4.0|Darren Aronofsky ([[ASIN:B00005Q4CS Requiem for a Dream]], [[ASIN:B001TOD92C The Wrestler]]) has an eerie and succinct way of examining the self-destructive methods us humans employ in forcing ourselves to fulfill our dreams and find the inspiration to become exactly who or what we desire.  His ability to portray the pitfalls of these transformations is even more dramatic and has propelled his status into what has to be one of this generation's truly great filmmakers.  His ability to get the very best performances out of his actors is something even his most scrutinizing critics cannot possibly deny.  All the performances in Aronofsky's Black Swan are worthy of praise.  Barbara Hershey's overbearing and profoundly envious mother will be slightly overlooked among the tall trees in Black Swan, but she is terrific here.  Mila Kunis's unlikely transformation into a serious dramatic actress and not just some cute lifeless mannequin is getting the praise it deserves.  Winona Ryder is appropriately handed the ideal role that not only compliments Portman's character but compelled me to draw interesting parallels between the two actresses careers.  Vincent Cassel is finally given a great dramatic role in a great dramatic American movie, and he is smarmy, yucky, vile, and as convincing as he's ever been; he's brilliant here.  The most amazing performance is of course Portman, who finally gets to showcase that she is this generation's greatest actress.  Those who've followed her less heralded performances ([[ASIN:B00116GEJ8 Goya's Ghosts]], [[ASIN:B00005JNC2 Garden State]], [[ASIN:6305327084 Beautiful Girls]]) know that for Portman it was only a matter of time that she find the right role to obtain the wider recognition she deserves.  Portman plays Nina Sayers as perfectly as can be expected but she clearly did the real life work to become a ballerina first and foremost.  More importantly than even that, she portrays Nina's dramatic and symbolic transformation at the film's climax with certainly her very best work, and some of the best acting I've seen in a number of years.  It is imperative that she win every major performing award of 2010.<br /><br />Black Swan follows ballerina Nina Sayers (Portman) of the New York City Ballet Company as she struggles for the lead role of the Swan Queen, a role that requires performing as not only the White Swan but also the Black Swan, in a production of Swan Lake directed by Thomas Leroy (Cassel).  Leroy feels Nina is perfect as the delicate White Swan but is unsure she can become the sensual and powerful Black Swan.  Nina is innocent and reserved in real life and as a dancer she possesses perfect mechanics, but she needs to let go of herself to find the Black Swan.  She finds an unwitting rival in Lily (Kunis) that may not have the skill set Nina has but she has the carefree attitude in general that is coveted for the role of Black Swan.  The film spirals into a tremendous psychological thriller brought on by jealousy, sensuality, unhealthy competition, and a little bit of drugs and alcohol.  I will say no more as Black Swan is full of turns you may not see coming and it behooves anyone to avoid spoilers for this amazing film.<br /><br />It should also be mentioned that Clint Mansell's soundtrack is outstanding and not only keeps with the film's theme but supports the legitimacy of Sayer's journey during even the most frightening moments.  Matthew Libatique got plenty of great cinematography practice in kitschy-er films, but this is his finest work.  In fact, Black Swan is technically immaculate.  I suppose the only thing that prevents me from giving it a perfect rating is the questions I had by the film's end.  I like questions after movies but unlike say last year's [[ASIN:B002ZG981E Inception]], the questions I ask after Black Swan might produce answer that not only lessen the film's effect on me at large but might even offer some possible plot inconsistencies and concerns regarding whether or not the story worked for me like it could have.  This still gets a very high recommendation.rked for me like it could have.  This still gets a very high recommendation.
B003EYVXXW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It focuses on a brilliant woman, Hypatia, who is a mathematician and astronomer. She is considered a philosopher. Her intellectual basis is classical Greece and it's great thinkers. She is a teacher, and an adviser to the rulers in the both the pagan world and it's successor.    She is in a world that is collapsing. She is in Roman-controlled Egypt,but changes are coming. Christians and Jews are coming to her city of Alexandria in large numbers, outnumbering the number of existing citizens. The immigrants came from a much more primitive society and change the whole character of the city.
B000050HTO|5.0|Bought this double CD set for my son at his request.  He wanted a CD with \\"Like  a Rolling stone\\" on it for Christmas.  With Amazon's help, I found this CD.  My  son went bonkers!  He loves it.  He couldn't get out of his truck cause he didn't   want to stop the CD --it was so good.   He said it is one of the best that he  has!!!

159562015X|2.0|I purchased the Kindle edition even though I read that several people did not receive the code to take the online test.  They all stated they eventually recieved it well it has been 15 days now and I still havent recieved it.  The book is only a little useful until you take the test.  You need to tkae the test before you read most of the book.  I was tired of waiting for the code so I read the rest of the book.  I have sent email out to both amazon and strengthsfinder with no help from eithor.  I do not recommend getting this on the Kindle.  Which is sad because it would be so easy to highlight strengths and review if the there was a code availible.    Disappointed
B0048LPRD2|3.0|As empty as its title would suggest, likely quite intentional, Enter the Void is indeed a void.  There is nothing here and my comments may come with some extra sharpness due to my tremendous feeling of disappointment.  You see [[ASIN:B00009W0U4 Irreversible]], director Gaspar Noe's second film, is one of my favorite movies ever made for all the reasons I've expressed before.  Sometimes a filmmaker is most generative during his breakthrough and can never equal that success, and other times a filmmaker might bounce back with something lesser but work enough that they can care to learn from their mistakes.  Noe's problems are that he doesn't work enough on feature films and also that his fans will welcome Enter the Void just for possessing Noe's dingy style and moments of legitimately shocking realistic shots.  So really, what is there to improve when Noe's goal is to make a polarizing film to begin with?  Aesthetically Noe is strong here but I expected that given his short films and music videos since Irreversible also possess that trademark style and appeal.  However, unlike Irreversible, and even his first film [[ASIN:B00005K9O8 I Stand Alone]], Enter the Void lacks a truly coherent story, or even characters worth caring about.  It's not that there isn't a story somewhere within the shock scenes hooking in the audience Noe has developed, it's just that the story was not compelling enough to draw me in.  That may change for some viewers but I'm betting most will find Enter the Void tedious and gratuitous.<br /><br />The film stars Nathanial Brown, from a first person point of view for the better part of the film, as an American named Oscar, a young man whose parents were killed in a brutal car crash with Oscar and his sister Linda in the backseat, watching and surviving.  Oscar lives in Tokyo and will soon be reunited with his sister.  Oscar deals drugs in Tokyo and Linda, after she settles in a little, quickly becomes involved in stripping.  The story is a solid vehicle for Noe's style but without revealing spoilers I will say that there is certainly room for a more robust interpretation of the story then I would be willing to provide.  So far the film has been extremely polarizing so I'm sure a more enthusiastic viewer can provide solid insights regarding Noe's greater intentions.<br /><br />There is still potential for Noe to create better work but given the amount of time it took to find the concept and actually begin working on Enter the Void, I find this doubtful.  I've had the patience to sit through films that claim to be meditations or cinematic experiences etc., but of those kinds of films I've enjoyed they hooked me in with strong overtones.  Because Enter the Void didn't hook me in, its rampant use of sex and nudity seemed out of place and completely unnecessary.  Visually though Enter the Void is still stunning and provides us with a very different perspective on the Japanese capital.  It's an aesthetic achievement and I can always appreciate it when an artist maintains his own distinct style over time, especially when that artist is talented, innovative, and unconventional.  Of all the praise and hate this film is receiving I'm offering a neutral recommendation.Noe's style but without revealing spoilers I will say that there is certainly room for a more robust interpretation of the story then I would be willing to provide.

0802136834|5.0|I am about half way through this book and I look forward to reading more every day.  I've read lots of books both fiction and non fiction about the Tudor period and Henry VIII, and I love all the detail and history in this book.  It really fills in the gaps that are left by a lot of other books.  If interested in this time period, I would definitely recommend this book.
B000ZI8E5K|3.0|This CD has titles, subjects and highlights on what's in the actual book, \\"Power of the Subconscious Mind.\\" By Joseph Murphy. I thought it was the entire book on CD but it is not. It is still okay but you don't get the meat and details of the book. For the price I paid, I wanted the entire book on CD.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Like another \\"reviewer\\", I'm giving this book five stars for not having read it but the fact that so many rated this book one star simply because of the price.  C'mon people, if you have an issue with Amazon Kindle pricing, lodge a complaint with Amazon and not on the author's review pages.  Based on some of his previous work that I've really liked, what you're doing is not fair to the author.  And because of you, the rest of us now do not have an accurate overall rating to determine whether we want to buy this book or not.  Thank a lot!  NOT!
B0015DROBO|4.0|If you can get through the beginning, you will love this book.  I stumbled over some of the names of people and places, but that did not take away from the story.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|well, i must say i couldn't wait to see this film...mainly because of how much i enjoyed the first one, although part of me was also a little scared at seeing this for the same reason. i was very pleased, however, when i came out of the theatre after seeing this \\"prequel\\". there are so many reasons this was just as good , if not better, than the first one. the biggest reason, for me, was that they didn't try and \\"fix\\" what wasn't ever broken. the first film was so good and worked so well that you'd really have to be a complete moron to try and change the formula for the second one. thankfully, they stuck to what worked, especially in the movie's style...i.e. the documentary feel with the camera. they also were creative enough to give the audience even more footage by having the family stick security cameras all around the house, because of a break in at the beginning of the film. that was brilliant. because of this they were able to keep the same feel of the first film and have many more ways to scare us at the same time. many people are writing in that the acting was better this time around but i disagree. to me the acting was fantastic in both films and wasn't any more or less believable in either one. i think there were more characters in the 2nd movie and therefore maybe people are somehow seeing MORE good acting, making it seem like it was better the 2nd time, but really, if ya go back, the acting is just as good. the directing was just as good, and the script may have been better the 2nd time...and that's saying a lot considering how great the first one was. all in all i came out enjoying this one just as much , if not more, than the first. now i'm just eagerly awaiting the release of the third installment this october, and am hoping it makes this one of the best horror trilogies ever put on film.
0316044938|5.0|I liked the book The Lovely Bones and found it quite compelling. The story of Susie Salmon, although heartbreaking and depressing, interested me. The book, as unusual as it was, was narrated by a 14-year-old girl who was the victim of a heinous murder. It tells of her struggle to let go of what she left behind on earth. Susie shares her perspective on her murderer and life in her family without her. She watches her siblings and has a hard time watching them do things she never had the chance to do, like go to high school and get married. Susie, as time continues in the story, learns to let go, which is when she realizes that she needs to move on so her family can move on too.<br /><br />My favorite parts in the novel were those where Susie connects with her family and friends even though she is now in heaven and the others are still on earth. Alice Sebold nicely described these parts and I found them most intriguing. Although the book has a depressing plot line, Susie is almost optimistic about the whole thing. It's one of my favorite books and I encourage others to read it too.

0486478998|5.0|My niece read this first and kept telling me about it. I got it and I'm glad I did! It is full of life changing information, ideas and thought processes. Everyone should read this book, no matter what religion or no religion at all!.
B0044KU7KU|2.0|I became a mcr fan after hearing the three cheers for sweet revenge album.  after the black parade, i was hooked and even went back and got \\"i bought u you my bullets\\" (which i still listen to now).  i even got the b sides and some other live performances.      needless to say, i was amped to get this album and patiently waited since august for it to come out.  na na na got leaked and it was ok, but i never thought that would be the best song on teh album.  this album redefines suckiness and takes it to a whole nother level.      i understand redefining yourself, but this was like a botched plastic surgery. they should have called the album from 'sugar to shhhhh'.  what happened guys?  I liked the playful dark lyrics of the previous albums.  i liked the high energy pop metal emo dark comic book thing you had going.      i really wanted to like this album, but i just can't get it.  maybe i'll listen through another time or two and hopefully it can grow on me, but if not i'll remember u on the b-side.
076115678X|5.0|I bought the first edition many years ago, and it inspired me to go curly for many years. My biggest obstacle, however, has been the eternal search for a hairdresser who knows how to cut curly hair. I love the fact that this edition includes instructions for trimming your own hair, and I also love the DVD with styling and cutting tutorials. I can now make a trek to Los Angeles or NYC for a good cut and take care of my own locks between expeditions.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|I must say that ive really enjoyed this whole series so far and this book just pulls you into the conflicts if its world and makes you wish there was more when its ultimately ends with maybe a not so perfect ending. The endimg is fine to me and i just cant wait until the fourth book finally comes out.

0425221806|5.0|This book will keep you up until all hours of the night saying to yourself, \\"just one more chapter...\\" It's suspenseful and fun and emotional at times. The characters aren't one dimensional, which I loved. This is my favorite Dean Koontz book, by far.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|By the end of an epic fantasy saga, oftentimes the finale is so obvious that it almost feels like the author is putting words to what everyone knows will happen. Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy does not suffer from that problem. The Hero of Ages is desperate and fast. As the world burns to ash around them, the characters we've grown with shed their personal problems and face the demise of the planet. Much like the previous two entries, the final chapter is filled with heroes you can't help but care about, and thats what makes these books great. With an ending more epic and unexpected than you could hope for, Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy ends on the same high-note it entered with.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|This ultimate edtion to watchmen is a must have for all watchmen fans.<br />This is a great movie. love the characters and the story. this movie is so close to a comic i have ever seen. this movie rocks
0060936223|4.0|Smith's prose is often lyrical and touching. Having lived through the same time period as a young woman some of her recollections are similar to mine..particularly the death of political leaders and musicians. She has been unfairly criticized here as a name-dropper when all she was doing was describing her experiences and her friendships with the folks at the Chelsea--many who did become quite famous. She has a deep and abiding spirituality that permeates the book. Raised as a Jehovah's Witness, her appeals to various Catholic saints was both constant and interesting to me. I suspect she admires the many layers of ritual and tradition in the RC church. Robert was the one raised Catholic and perhaps that provides the real paradox in this memoir. Despite breaking new erotic boundaries in his photographs the parochial sense of orthodoxy could still prevail. I am thinking of his telling Patti when she was leaving NYC with Fred-\\"What am I going to tell my mother?\\" They had lied to his folks and said they were married not cohabitating. \\"Tell them we got divorced! I can't..Catholics don't get divorced.\\" The one overriding theme in this book is that the deep constancy and commitment of a loving lifetime friendship can often outlast the conventionality of romantic love and, in some cases, even add to it. Good on you, Patti, for sticking by your old frineds even as you drafted new chapters in your life.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|I grew up with a Sci-Fi imagination and read the genre to escape the realities of adolescence. I collect films in every genre but \\"horror\\" (which I consider thinly veiled \\"snuff porn\\" sold to an only-too-eager audience).     My response to \\"Splice\\" is unique. I had to shut my eyes through several difficult and uncomfortable moments. Also, I believe all the 1-star and 5-star reviews are accurate. However, it seems clear that the real difference in these two extremes is in how reviewers process their discomfort.     If you are in the habit of rejecting everything that makes you uncomfortable, you won't like the film inspite of the good acting, writing, direction, and production values. On the other hand, if you are intrigued by seeing things you never quite imagined, you will like the film but be unclear about why because it also made you uncomfortable.     As someone interested in science's impact on society, the most intriguing thing I can offer about this film is that it will take you somewhere inside yourself that a sci-fi flick doesn't often take you, and you will either hate the thing that took you there, or be intrigued by it.    Yes, this film uses easily-recognized devices to elicit this emotion or that. Yes, the acting and writing are way above average for the genre. Yes, this film is creepy... but, unlike lesser efforts, it is also restrained in this regard. Yes, it has \\"sequel\\" written all over it (which, if it has the same writer/director and female lead, would be a potentially good thing).     However, what I appreciated most about this movie was the flawed, human context in which scientists are scientists and do science. Their (and our) hubris underlying some of what they have done (atomic, chemical, and biological weapons), and what some of them are only too eager to do in the future (splice together human and non-human DNA) is breath-taking. And, of course, what scenario would be complete without one bright, ambitious moran saying to another, \\"If we don't do it, someone with fewer moral scrupples will.\\"    Interestingly, this film also has an element of Biblical Eve in it. Just as in Richard Kelly's \\"The Box,\\" it is the woman (in the case of \\"the Box,\\" the women) who finds it impossible NOT to cross a recognized moral/ethical line, and is udderly determined to defy the significant male in her life in order to do so. \\"Splice\\" goes further by suggesting that this gender-specific trait will survive the splicing of human and non-human genes.
B0042VJ1PI|1.0|I am truly ashamed of myself for actually finishing this book.  I wanted to like it, but it only took a few pages to realize that it was one of the poorest pieces of mystery fiction I have ever read.  Ridiculous characters, laughable diagogue and a boring plot.  Avoid this one!
B00000I0XW|5.0|Love her voice, although it was difficult to make out the words at times. Overall,the CD was very enjoyable. The Phantom Of The Opera Duets were fantastic!!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I was looking for something a bit different for a break form my usual nonfiction fare. I picked this up and was somewhat skeptical. I had never read anything by the author before so she was unknown to me. I was very pleasantly surprised by how charming and engaging the book is. The writing is wonderful and the characters are well-developed. I am looking into more Kinsella titles.

B004289ZW0|3.0|Got the GPS and it worked easily as stated. Maps/Apps for GPS can be a nightmare and they dont come cheap. If you want to have a GPS to navigate around, best to buy a proper GPS unit like Garmin, etc. The maps are far more accurate and you get them free. The Wi-fi GPS dries up your battery because of the bluetooth and in the long run, your iPad battery becomes an issue. Which leads you to ponder if you first bought the iPad for GPS or its other uses.    Overall, the GNS 5870 is a nice toy to add to the endless gadgets you can buy.
B0033ZJBJK|4.0|This review is for the audio book of Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />I absolutely love the Twilight series. Stephanie Meyer is a brilliant storyteller. As such, I highly recommend the books; however, I do not recommend the audio book.<br /><br />My only complaint with the audio series is that Listening Library/Random House should have commissioned Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner to read Breaking Dawn. From watching the movies, fans have become accustomed to hearing Kristen's voice narrate the thoughts of Bella Swan; but more importantly, her voice is more pleasant to the ear than that of Ilyana Kadushin's voice.<br /><br />Ilyana Kadushin's voice is an interesting combination of a sultry mezzo with a nasal twinge near the end of each word. Listening to Ilyana, it feels more like the character of Victoria is reading the book, than Bella. It is not that her voice is completely unattractive. She would make a great morning radio talk show host. Her voice is better suited for comedy, in my opinion, than the emotional outpourings of a teenage girl.<br /><br />To sum it up, I love the books, but can't stand the narration.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|There's a reason this movie lost to hurt locker during the oscars, it sucks. Nobody cares about the dumb blue aliens w/ squid pony tails riding dinosaur birds or their gay tree. Drop the bomb on \\"pandora\\" and move on. Highly overrated & overpriced, sure huge budget and flashy special effects though.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|This is one of the best products on the market.  It is very fast and is a great processor overall.  I think it is a little overpriced, but for the 6 core processor, it was worth it for me.
B0047VEE0U|1.0|I really expected this to be pretty cool. I have to admit that I am a massive Harry Potter dork and love all of this little packages that they like to charge so much for. In all honesty, this was a huge letdown. I opened the box and immediately felt like this was a waste of money. The score is wonderful, but the rest of this package feels like it was cheapy thrown together so someone could charge loyal fans an additional $50 for a score to a fantastic movie. In my opinion, save your money, maybe so see the movie several more times in theater instead and buy the one-disc CD. Believe me, the 4 pieces of paper in this package and the cheap box it comes in is not worth it.
B002N5N5M0|1.0|I bought this product based on price and saved it to watch for when I was on my Christmas vacation (as I already own the first 3 seasons on DVD), and I regret that decision - the season was shot digitally, which is fine when the transfer is done correctly, but the 4th episode (disk 2) was barely watchable in that the pixels were so far off it was all I could do to get through the episode, and episode 5 was not as bad but was also poor quality - I will probably end up buying it again from a local retailer where it is easy to return if it doesn't play right.
B0033PSH4U|5.0|I am so glad that I found this! I love this movie so much. It's never on tv anymore, and when it is, it's edited for content! Thank you so much Amazon! I couldn't be anymore satisfied!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I love this movie. The acting is superb and the story is well-written. You will really get into their lives and want to give some hugs.
B0001I561E|1.0|I was very upset when I opened this movie for my daughter on christmas only to find out that it was a fake movie. the packaging on the movie was very cheaply made along with the inserts and dvd being very cheaply printed with several misspellings on it. I spent 20$ on this movie only to find out that it was a fake. I truly hope the seller was not aware of this and will do everything in their power to make it right
0061997811|5.0|What a wonderful book!I was so excited when this came and I was even more thrilled as I started to flip through the pages. I did not expect it to be packed with all of this information and detail. The little \\"extras\\" that are included totally put it over the top. For the price this is an excellent gift for a Harry Potter fan of any age, and I have suggested it to several people for the HP fans in their families. This far outstrips the some of teh more expensive movie tie-ins that are of low quality and are produced to make a buck.
B002ZG993Q|2.0|This film is not a thriller by any means.  Very slow with some action thrown in to wake you up.  It seems like an artsy European film that you need to be very patient with.  If you love to just watch George then watch the movie.  The plot is OK but could have been done much better.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This controller is labeled as a video game. Anyways, it works and was exactly what I needed. The cord is very long, which is a plus for me. It works with either system so this is a great deal.
B003ES61EE|4.0|This is a good basic lens cleaner in a convenient pen system that's easy to slip into a camera case.  Serviceable but not top of the line.
1857885082|3.0|As an English ex-pat, who has been living in the US for 12 years, I am enjoying this book. It's a good read and makes me smile.  But there is a glaring, glaring omission - children! Nothing about attitudes towards children, attitudes of children towards adults - nothing. It's like they don't exist. Nothing about  the elderly either. This book is written by a 30-something about a 20 or 30-something's world. The author writes about her life and what matters to her. That's OK and  it's amusing. But it cannot pretend to be a comprehensive or, as is often implied, 'scientific' account of English social behavior when it ignores so much of the population or the population's concerns.
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|The kids loved the idea of having a Lego Camera and everywhere we went people made comments about it.  It is also very durable.  Downside, it only takes 50 photos and then you have to download it to a computer, which may not always be available on a trip.  Also the picture quality is quite bad.  The flash 'burns' the subject's face out and the picture is quite distored when viewed on your computer.  The kids (ages 9,6) loved this toy.  But do not expect it to be something other than that.  If you are looking for a camera, do not buy it.  If you are looking for a toy.. and will be prepared to pay the price, it is a great toy!
B00002SSKI|5.0|The family has a great time with this movie. The soundtrack is a lot of fun and so are the characters. It has great rewatchability!
B000P6XU5G|5.0|This is one of my top 5 all time movies. The BluRay is incredible. I found myself checking out all the little things. The detail is great. If you've never seen this movie I recommend the BluRay version, if you've seen this movie before & liked it, check out this version, you will not be disappointed.
B0015AARJI|4.0|This controller is fun to have.  Most people have them by now though.  Feel like I'm the last kid on the block with one.  Still haven't used it for many games.  It's fun for God of War Collection though.  The thing I really dig about this controller is the weight.  It's slightly heavier than the featherweight non shock controller and that makes it feel so much better in the hand.  Other controller is way to light.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|\\"Salt\\" is an exceptional thriller that keeps one's attention throughout the entire film.  I'm usually not a fan of Angelina Jolie.  However, her performance was superb in this film.  I was convinced that she was a heroine-villain who was part of a very strange plot by the Russian government to knock off the Russian president, with the aim of fueling war between America and Russia.  However, there are twists in this film that make the film quite great.
0345472322|5.0|I bought the book because a speaker had mentioned it in a conference. I found it very useful, and bought more copies to distribute to my teacher friends. All the content may not be relevant for educators; but most of it is, and all of it makes sense. Only, there's a lot of repetition, which is a bit tiring; but you can skip over when that happens.
B0018RWMNM|4.0|This is a great movie. I've been watching the video tape version off my TV since this movie came out. The BluRay version is so much better, although not perfect. The night scenes do not look like BluRay at all, and seemed like they had a much lesser quality to them. Not many night scenes though. Overall this is so much better to watch then the version I had. The scene I remember most is the picnic scene with Angelica Houston & Robert Duvall sitting there talking. The detail of everything in that scene was incredible. The food looked like you could reach over & grab it & the flowers & leaves & grass were all so lifelike, as was the quilt, & the detail in their clothing was unreal. The movie I rate as a 5, The BluRay quality a 4 only because I feel the whole thing wasn't true BluRay.
0307704076|5.0|I got the audio cd of this book after hearing Seth Godin's speeches on Youtube. Very smart guy. Doesn't overcomplicate things.     The most important thing I learned was to ship my product! If I don't ship, I don't succeed :)
B003X8597A|4.0|The vocalists are simply great.  It was difficult to imagine this opera taking place during the time of Mussolini! But it is the only extant video we have of RIENZI, albeit with many cuts.  I think Wagner is turning over in his grave.
0399536108|4.0|Chris Guillebeau's book, [[ASIN:0399536108 The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World]], brings an appealing message that a new kind of lifestyle is possible for anybody who pursues it. He says that we don't need to be confined by others' expectations. We don't have to trade the joy and excitement of life for security. He says that taking the risk of being extraordinary can bring you success as you define it.<br /><br />He quit his last \\"conventional job\\" at the age of 20, made a living on Ebay, worked four years for a medical mission in Africa, came back and put together a blog titled The Art of Non-Conformity, [...], exploring the topics in this book, and has appeared in The New York Times, MSNBC, CNN.com, Business Week, top blogs all over the web, including Slate and the Huffington Post.<br /><br />The Art of Non-Conformity expands on his blog's manifesto, \\"A Brief Guide to World Domination.\\" Part autobiography and part inspirational how-to, the book maintains the breezy writing style and engaging design that we expect from the internet. It's a quick read, not an exhaustive how-to, but an exploration of what's possible, with some bracing examination of the tough choices it might take.<br /><br />The book offers hope for people stifled by the cubicle. In a time when more and more employees are choosing the freedom and sanity of an entrepreneurial life over the so-called security of a steady job, there are a lot of good books directed to the aspirations and questions of that lifestyle. What makes this book different are a couple of points of focus:<br /><br />1. The tradeoffs you'll have to make.<br />2. The importance of community<br /><br />He's certainly not the first to tell people to march to their own drummer, take the road less traveled, live an extraordinary life. He has come at a time when those goals are more doable than at any other time in human history.<br /><br />Chris captures in an intensely practical way the reality that we can meet those longings. It's not easy, it may not be fast, and it entails the risk that all great undertakings entail.<br /><br />He quotes Ernest Shackleton's recruitment flyer for his early exploration of Antarctica:<br /><br />Men wanted for Hazardous Journey.

B002ZG99NG|4.0|I was a little hesitant to watch this based on comparisons made to Michael Mann's classic film Noir, heat.  I am happy to report the only similarity is a bank heist gone wrong.  Beyond that, the main characters could not be more disimilar, which is a good thing.  A well acted struggle to escape a scripted life...  Everyone in this film, even the police, know they are losers with no other choices.  Whether it was Bonnie and Clyde, Heat, or The Professional, we get used bloodshed being the only end...
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|There's not a bad song on this album - I would not be able to praise it highly enough if I tried.    It is one of those rare albums which is an instant hook almost all the way through, and one that grows on you at the same time. Nothing but highlights here, no filler at all. The band's in incredible form here, this should have a 4.5 star average here, I'm surprised it doesn't.    Can't wait for the next album. You don't need other bands when you have Incubus.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|This was a fun retelling of an old classic. I would have given it five stars except it was a little scary for young ones. My kids are old enough to enjoy this movie, but they wouldn't have been a couple of years ago. The other thing I didn't like about it was the ghost of Christmas present. He laughs an uncomfortable ammount of the time he is on the screen. Maybe that's the way he's supposed to be, but I really could have lived with a few less chuckles. Other than that, this was a fantastic movie.
B001U6YI92|5.0|No doubt about.    Sergio Leone's masterpiece finilizing the trilogy.  This bluray comes with a restaured and extended version of the the movie, wich only makes it better.

The case is nice and disappears when put on a shelf. I won't write anymore, because I don't like super long reviews.
B000Z27HLS|3.0|I loved this re-telling of Northanger Abby. I first saw it on television and was amazed and how well I loved the charcters. The only small problem I had was that the video version cut out small parts. However, they were not important scenes and would only be caught by those who had seen the 'full' televised version. Still a great movie were I completly loved Cathrines' innocence, and Mr. Tilneys' charisma.

B000ZOW96Y|3.0|Great movie, keeps you guessing what will happen. Rented it with Amazon's Video-On-Demand and video quality was bad in the second half of the movie. Never had that problem with other V-O-D's from Amazon.
0385738757|5.0|The follow up to, Dashner's Maze Runner, will not let fans down. The Scorch Trials, will have you gripping the edge of your seat at every turn, Dashner's story weaving leave the reader in full suspense at every turn. I highly, recommend this book as an outstanding read for all ages.
0789302691|3.0|The book is great, but as my title said, it could had been better. Pictures are explendit, they are really represetative of the band and at the same time a demostration of the talent of photographers Lance Macer And Chelsterson. My issue is that i`ve seen more of their work on internet and lots of the greatest pictures from these two are not into the book. Plus, I`d liked to see some text on this book. It barely has an credicts page and you`ll see no more text until the end of the book.    I would recomend it to fans of the band if what you want is a soft recordatory from the old days. But would not recomend it to photographers who are seeking a great book for inspiration. For me it felt a little incomplete. Stell there are some great pictures on it.
B003UBTX72|1.0|This is the most boring book I have ever read. I normally read a book a week. It has taken me two and a half months to read half of this book, and today, I give up! I find that I don't make time for reading. I'd rather watch TV - that's a first! I don't even want to pick this book up. I've been reading for 40 years and always finish a book when I start it. I was determened to get to the interesting part and (after reading half the book) it hasn't come yet. Keith Richards rambles on, and on, and on, and on......and repeats things over, and over in the book. He rambles about how to play certain riffs and the styles of other great musicians. I don't want to learn how to play the guitar. I want to know about his interesting life. What a dud! I am moving on to another book. Anything will top this.

0061020680|4.0|I have to say I liked this book of the Discworld series.  Although technically the fourth book in the series, this could be read as a stand-alone quite easily.  The only thing you really need to know about Discworld is that its a disc shaped world, held up by four elephants who in turn are on the back of a giant turtle, and it's a magical world.<br /><br />Mort is kind of hopeless.  All lanky limbs and awkward he definitely can't go into the family business, all his hopes as an apprentice are quickly dashed when the job market doesn't yield a prospective employer for him.  Then, when all hope is lost, and the clock chimes midnight, Death comes for him.  But its ok, really, Death just wants to take him on as an apprentice (although I'm not sure why).  He gets to travel back with Death to his home where he meets his man servant Albert (who is more than meets the eye), his daughter Ysabell (very stubborn and willful and who Albert WILL NOT be set up with if he has his way), and of course learns a little more about Death himself.<br /><br />With all his training comes great responsibility however.  When he's not mucking out the stalls for Death's horse he is learning how to be there for important deaths.  The training goes so well that Death decides to take a vacation and Mort will be in charge.  This doesn't go so well though as Mort doesn't carry through on the death of beautiful princess Keli and throws the whole world askew.  With death enjoying himself in the kitchen, he has to figure out a way to restore balance to Discworld.<br /><br />The characters in this book, with the exception of Death, are only so-so in this book.  I didn't really enjoy any of them.  More detail would have been greatly appreciated and would have helped develop them better.  Ysabell was annoying and Mort was just awkward.  Death on the other hand, was fantastic.  He was very stoic but also had a unique way of approaching the world that made him absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />Pratchett's writing was much better in this novel.  I found parts funnier than in the other's of his I read and the story came together cohesively.  Then he spoiled it with the ending.  I don't want to give much away but it was such a cheap way of finishing the story I just couldn't like it.  It almost ruined the rest of the book for me.<br /><br />I look forward to the next book in this series and hope they keep improving.  It seems that there is a reason why movies have been made and a large fan base formed for this series, and I'm finally starting to see it.<br /><br />Mort<br />Copyright 1987<br />236 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|First heard this music when it was used by a local theater company for background music.  It caught my ear so I asked about it, then bought the CD.  Flo is AMAZING!!  The album is produced well, the artist is talented and creative and is a true musician.  She definitely thinks outside of the box.  Reminiscent of Kate Bush and Souxie and the Banshees.  Very FUN!!

0553381687|5.0|I love a well written fantasy series. What I love even more is the realistic base that this series draws from. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed years of rereading tolkien, and ashamedly have read most of the dragonlance series. However I've grown quite tired of the D&D world of fantasy and often have read more historical based material due to this.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin has created one of the most enthralling stories I've read in years. I've just concluded book 3 in this series and eagerly started book 4. What a wonderful epic and a very serious one at that. It's easy to see why HBO choose to make this into a upcoming TV program.<br /><br />To stick to this book let me just state that you'll find a few better beginnings for a story. It's a quite lull that eventually cascades into a momentous storm of grand scale. If you enjoy a multi-character driven plot and a long journey to the finish line this a great series. However if you often get bored of a single book, or get easily confused with lots of strung together plot points this may not be the story for you. It often leaves you chasing several issues at one time, for the focused reader it's very rewarding. Again, this can be very cumbersome if you don't like detailed and complex story lines.<br /><br />Never does this feel overwhelming, it's just great story telling and gives so much depth. I've enjoyed big saga's before(i.e Dune and it's surrounding volumes) and this story is truly gripping and fresh.<br /><br />If you like to read and enjoy intense, dark and gritty material this will give you a ride worth the admission fee.
0439023521|5.0|I was determined not to read this book. I was tired of getting sucked into the new popular series (Harry Potter, Twilight, Girl with Dragon tattoo etc) Not to mention I can't stand anything (movies, books, tv shows) having to do with a post-apocalyptic setting.  Well I gave in to the peer pressure and purchased the Hunger Games. I read the first hundred pages the first night and went to work tired and bleary eyed. I finished it the next day and haven't been able to stop talking about it.   Honestly, this book has NOTHING in it that I thought would appeal to me. Young adult novel, violent, depressing, post-apocalyptic etc. It was one of the best, most exciting books I have read in a very long time. I think a lot of the negative views are those who once again cannot seperate fact vs fiction.  Enjoy the book for what it is. A high powered adventure about survival.   My only concern now is when are my next 2 books in the series arriving????
1936594234|5.0|This book is actually two previously published books: The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, originally published in 1963, and How to Attract Money, originally published in 1955. This new compilation expertly presents modern day knowledge and fascinating information about the power of our hidden subconscious minds. Murphy, (1898-1981) a new thought minister, believed that the subconscious mind is a darkroom where we develop the images that are to be played out in real life. The conscious mind sees an event, takes a picture of it and remembers it, while the subconscious mind works backward, seeing something before it happens (and this is why intuition is infallible). The subconscious responds to habit and regular habitual thinking. It is totally neutral in a moral sense, and is happy to adopt any habit as normal - whether good or bad. Unaware of our negative thoughts, we let them drop into our subconscious in every minute of our lives, and then are surprised when they find expression in daily experiences and relationships. When we become aware of this process and unearth the gems of knowledge that are hidden, we can become free from the patterns that we have created. A great read with many useful techniques and ideas.<br />-- Jelina Vance, New Connexion Journal
B000M53GM2|2.0|Number 17 in the Bond series is pretty much a compilation of 90's action films and as a result has dated considerably. I consistently see this film put among the best Bond films in fan forums, particularly among the 18-30 age group, either for the sake of nostalgia or the fact that they loved the video game this spun-off of. I don't hate Goldeneye but I am rather annoyed by this film's so-called \\"classic\\" status among Bond fans, and non-fans, alike.     I am just going to be frank, Pierce Brosnan is dead-last on my list of Bond actors. He never brought anything worth value to the role of Bond except having the right looks. It seemed like the previous actors did everything else for him and he was just there to fill in the empty slot. Even Roger Moore, who was a bit too much of a comedian in his Bond films, had a remarkable talent of making the dumbest lines and moments dignified no matter how bad his films got. Brosnan isn't a bad actor but he was a total non-entity. He felt like a coporate logo as opposed to a character.    The film itself moves quickly enough with a standard larger-than-life scheme that would impact the world. A former 00-agent, 006 Alec \\"Janus\\" Trevelyan played by Sean Bean, betrays Bond and manages to take control of a EMP weapon housed in outerspace. The weapon, dubbed Goldeneye, has the capability rendering electronic items useless. Trevelyan was alledgely billed as \\"the man who knows James Bond\\" but the writers never took advantage of this. He does every Bond villian cliche. Does he leave Bond to die in a escapable trap ? Yes. Is he surprised every time he shows up alive ? You bet. Alec even pulls a \\"Blofeld\\" and lets Bond stay in the control room to screw up all his plans. On an ironic note despite my mis-givings of Trevelyan, I always thought that Sean Bean would have made a far better Bond. Bean is a little rough around the edges but he carries himself far better than Bronsnan in this film and actually having the better dialogue.     Basically, this is a very standard action film. Natalya was a decent Bond girl, the other minor villians ranged from great like Ourmunov to the very annoying Xenia and Boris. There seems to be echoes of major action films from the 90's like Terminator 2, No Escape and yes, even Jurassic Park when the film shifted to Cuba inside Trevelyan's base of operations. Eric Serra's film score is lagerly inappropriate making some scenes just far too moody and there is a litter of general James Bond cliches. There were better Bond films made and Goldeneye isn't one of them.        As an aside note, why did this film look so cheap ? They spent far more than they had on The Living Daylights just eight years earlier and yet Goldeneye looks like a TV movie. Sure there was a few good shots in Monte Carlo and Cuba but everything else looked like rubbish. Then what further exacerbated the film's cheap look was the excessive use of minatures. Practically everything that blows up or flies in this film, and it was a lot on both counts, clearly was just a model. If you think I exagerrate Special Effects Supervisor Derek Meddings, who died before the film was released, himself stated he made more models in this movie than any other film he worked on and he had worked on many blockbusters over his long career.

B0049P1VHS|3.0|Compared to other popular sci-fi TV shows, $30 for six episodes is too much:     Farscape: The entire series - $67 for four seasons    Buffy the Vampire Slayer - 122 hours for about $140    Lost: Complete Series on Blu-Ray - 84 hours for $180    Too bad, the show is a lot of fun -- albeit maybe a little longwinded at times.
0887307280|5.0|This is a fine book showing some of the flaws of small businesses and why so many fail. The author uses a fictional small business owner who started a pie shop and running herself ragged. She has a great gift in making pies but is burning herself out. She was thinking about how she her job was making and selling pies when her business could and should be so much more.    Successful companies don't actually sell the products that they make. They fulfill an emotional need of their clients. For instance, Southwest Airlines is not selling airline tickets but a fun way to travel. Disney is not selling you a Mickey Mouse hat but to experience having the innocence of child again. Harley-Davidson is not selling you a motorcycle - but a membership to a rebellious, unbridled culture.    This book finally made some sense about why someone would write a book telling the world their secrets. The author possibly has hit a ceiling on the amount of time he can invest - the amount of money he can make. The only way he could make more money is to leverage himself in making CD's, doing lectures, and yes, writing books.    The third major point this book made was about systems. I really dislike systems in the workplace because they dehumanize the person. However, the author made some of the best arguments against this notion. I'm forced to rethink my ideas on this subject.    But if you are a small business owner or are looking to become one, you really have to read this.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I really like the way Sanderson set up the magic system in this first book.  It's obvious more traditional spellcasting will come into play laer in this series, but Sanderson focuses on a heretofore forgotten class of casters - tank mages.  Though shardbearers/wielders (possessers of magically wrought plate armor and sword of ancient, mysterious origin) are primarily buffed fighters, mentions of the Knights Radiant imply several magical abilities are in the offing.  Soulcasting (read: pure spellcasting) is rather intriguing as well, as it seems to be built on sacrificing certain truths about one's self to extra-dimesional beings in some nether realm.  This is the first magic system I've really gotten beind, and it appears (finally) that the author is committed to explaining it in detail.  As for the style of writing, well, it's a bit unrealistic.  Deaths aren't very tragic (usually peripheral characters), betrayals are poorly planned and executed, and everything ends happily.  This doesn't necessarily detract from the novel, however.  As I mentioned in the title, the book has a fairly fast pace.  All in all, you get an overwhelmingly fun, interesting, and capturing novel you just want to fall into.  If you're looking for a good time, buy this!  It won't disappoint.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|This show is great fiction.  Though so daring in its day, it still wow'ed my friends who are spoiled with today's delayed viewing of movie channels' series.   As for Amazon's delivery and quality of product, it arrived within a few days and was as fine in its physical and technical components as if I had purchased it in a store.
0316098337|5.0|The missing article in the title of the novel is not to be fancy or fashionable. The absence of a `the' or an `a' makes a point. Room is how the protagonist and narrator five-year old Jack calls the place where his mother and he live. It is a room, but not an ordinary one. This room is their world. He calls her Ma - this, as far as he knows, is her name. He has spent his whole life as a captive in this place. His mother has been there for about 7 years.<br /><br />Emma Donoghue's novel \\"Room\\" is a triumph of narrative and character and plot development. It could have depressive, sentimental and manipulative - but she avoids all these traps with her perceptive prose and use of language. There couldn't have been a better choice than to tell the story in the first person, that is through Jack's eyes, perception of the world and sensibility.<br /><br />Jack has spent his whole life inside Room with his Ma, and everything there is his friend, his Bed, his Books and so on. Donoghue overcomes these limitations by his innocence and sense of wonder when he faces discoveries. He and his mother are unpredictable characters, as is the plot development as their world expands.<br /><br />Inspired by a real story that horrified the world, Donoghue searches and finds the free spirit that lives inside every human being. Jack is not an allegorical character, and when the humanism of the novel explode they - and we, as well - realize that freedom is a right to everyone. While Jack was the master of his world when locked in Room, the Outside, as he calls, well, the outside, is as challenging as pleasant.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Anybody who has read Percy Jackson, such as myself, is sure to love this new series.  It introduces new charters but keeps some of the old.  It also brings in new conflicts in the world of demigods, but still contains fudes between the charters that we all know and love, such as Annabeth and Hera.  This book continues where &#34;The Last Olympian&#34; left off.  Yet it still has to bridge the two series together and I thought that it did a wonderful job in doing so.  I cannot wait for the next book to come out so that I can finally learn how it ends up, yet I do not want it to end!!  This book is well worth the money!
B003BKZW1S|2.0|Since I recently had a good experience with [[ASIN:1439192561 Full Dark, No Stars]] I thought I'd give another Stephen King book a go, and while Lisey's Story is well-written - I did not even have a problem with the heavy use of invented language - I was reminded of some of the reasons I originally lost interest in King.    It's quite typical King, even though when it was published it was marketed as his departure into more subtle, emotional, literary storytelling... I remember ads for the book on busses saying something like \\"he's chilled your bones... now he'll break your heart\\".  Maybe he hadn't written a supernatural love story before, but I can list 4 major elements of Lisey's Story that are recycled from previous King books and I don't have a deep knowledge of him.    <Warning: Possible spoilers ahead>    - Obsessive fans of a writer who become homicidal stalkers when they don't get what they want (Misery)    - Continuous interruptions of the current action with flashbacks to repressed memories and childhood memories narrated in present tense, segued into by chapters that are cut off mid-sentence (It)    - Fathers possesed by something evil that wants to kill their kids who happen to be precocious and have supernatural gifts that help them defend themselves (The Shining)    - A female main character in jeopardy having lots of flashbacks and inner dialogue while relatively little happens in the present (Gerald's Game)    Even if the ideas are recycled they wouldn't necessarily make for a bad book, I did get the feeling King was throwing the kitchen sink in there with a lack of confidence that any one element is strong enough to hold the reader's interest, which is a shame cuz there are some moments that did get a few tears out of me. The invented language and its use in posthumous communications from Scott that only Lisey would be able to decipher actually made me relate to Lisey's mix of excitement and renewed grief as she discovered them - perhaps because I share some invented vocabulary with my partner that identifies her for me as surely as her voice, and I imagine missing both equally if we were ever parted.    So Lisey has lost her husband and considering what she's up against in this book she should be one of those strong female leads for which chicks love SK novels, but her excessive reliance on her husband's alternative world to deal with the physical dangers in the book offsets the sense of heroism for me. I felt one of the weakest moments is when Lisey's sister sits around watching an irrelevant video while Lisey spends the time indulging in flashbacks as they wait for the bad guy to show up. When he does, and cuts the power they realize they left the flashlight in the car and her sister chooses that moment to ask what her plan is.    With the supernatural wild cards up the main character's sleeve, a lot of the suspense comes from the narrative's coyness about the book's secrets due to the \\"purple curtain\\" of repression, but I feel like suspense should grow more organically out of the story rather than be manufactured by the narrator withholding the book's secrets.    King can spin a readable book out of almost any idea, but for me that means his books often have a taste and an aftertaste... you can usually get into any Stephen King book as you read it but a few hours after you finish you can find yourself realizing that the actual action that's been described was kind of stupid.
B003Y7L5W8|5.0|I've been an OMD fan since I got the \\"Best of\\" in 88'.  I've bought every disc since along with everything before and was excited to discover they had a new one out.  After getting it and discovering it was the original guys back together made it even better! I am definitely blown away by the sounds they've created here.  These guys write with huge depth and build songs that are catchy and beg to be listened to.  I love the layers of synthesizers and am having a hard time getting past the first 5 songs on the disc.  The 2 History of Modern concept songs are brilliant!  These guys are true to form on this recording and it should please any OMD fan!
B001EYGOG0|5.0|First of all, I love the basie band, so there is obviously going to be some bias here.  This CD swings and sings.  The ballads are well done but the swing tunes are terrific.

0316098337|4.0|I wouldn't quite go 5 stars with it since *spoilers* the rescue does seem to happen too fast and the post-rescue bit drags on.  I didn't mind the repetition in the pre-rescue parts because that helped build up the claustrophobic feeling of living in a small room with limited things to do.  Once Jack is out in the world, he's seeing all these new things but his understanding remains mostly the same (or lack there of) so it drags a bit -we didn't need so many instances of him not understanding common turns of phrase, for example.  But I realized that alot of the post-rescue story was needed to flesh out Ma.  She was shown as nothing but a doting mother up until the rescue and then you realize she was normal teenage girl when she went into Room and wanted to feel that way again when she got out. I enjoyed reading how that played out.  The suicide attempt did seem to come suddenly but it made sense -it was the first time in her life when she didn't have Jack's well-being to focus on so everything else she could think about -the future, the trial, the press- overwhelmed her.     The \\"bad grammar\\" that people complain about makes sense -he's five! His grammar actually isn't that bad, he gets his tenses wrong and his mom almost always corrects him when he says it out loud.  Also, his mother isn't a teacher by trade and has limited tools so if he doesn't have quite the skills of a \\"normal\\" five year old, that would make sense too.  He knows big words because they played the game Parrot and that seemed to be the origins of his seemingly advanced way of speaking, his understanding was not at the same level as the what he was able to say.  The lack of articles -calling things Rug, Table, etc.- was not \\"bad grammar\\" it was him imbuing inanimate objects with identity because, hello!, there are no other people besides TV characters and his mom. I completely understand if reading a book in the voice of a child just bothers you, I thought it would bother me, but I think it is sillyto blame the grammar.  It's a style you either like or don't, but I don't think it's poor writing and it was a gutsy thing for the author to try, even if it had turned out badly (which I don't think it did.)    And finally, the breastfeeding. Yes, it's way creepy for a very bright, verbal 5 year old to be articulating his breastmilk preferences but I am certain that the author intended it to be unsettling.  The best answer to all the \\"ew gross\\" talk is what Ma says in her press conference, basically that of all the horrors of the situation -kidnapping, rape- her breastfeeding is what bothers people? Also, if you think about it for even 2 seconds you realize that breastmilk was literally the only thing she could give him that she didn't have to ask Old Nick for.  It was something that made him happy that only she could give him so would YOU deny him that one thing in that situation when there is no societal reason to stop? It both weirded me out and was touching but also a relief when she finally made him stop!     It was a quick read and really engrossing (I don't typically get swept up with books and read them in one day.)  I like anything that makes me feel something, and this made me feel many somethings -sad, disgusted, happy, etc.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Nina (Natalie Portman), a repressed ballet dancer, experiences breaks from reality when she lands the lead role in \\"Swan Lake,\\" which requires her to explore her dark side in order to dance the part of the sensual Black Swan.    Natalie Portman gives an amazing performance in this intense film, definitely deserving of a best actress nomination.  She is completely natural in a very demanding role that included doing much of her own dancing.  Director Darren Aronofsky reveals Nina's character to us gradually.  At first, she seems like a very together young lady with a supportive mother (Barbara Hershey) and a dream job, but we soon begin to learn that there is much more going on beneath the surface.  Aronofsky's approach allows us to make these discoveries for ourselves rather than laying it all out for us.  At times, we are not sure what is fantasy and what reality.  I felt he stumbled a bit at times (possible minor spoilers here) with some scenes of physical transformation and some business with her mother's paintings that contrasted in a jarring fashion with an otherwise subtle yet devastating portrait of obsession.

030746363X|5.0|I really enjoyed my first copy, so I ended up ordered two more copies so i can give them out as holiday gifts. It's a really dense book packed with interesting information. Don't take every word of the book, but overall it's got some crazy ideas and if you're into that, it's definitely entertaining. It's also has a variety of things, it's bound to have at least one thing that interests you. Great price and good delivery time. I really like Tim, and his writing style is easy to follow. My only complaint would be that it doesn't really address every question that you may come up against what he is saying but he does a pretty good job, considering how intense some of these topics are.

B002ZCY7SW|3.0|A lot of people have already broken down what's good and bad about the final season of 24, so I won't get into that here. While I don't think Season 8 was the best (that's still Season 1 in my opinion), it got a lot better as it went on, and ended the series on a great note. Like most 24 fans, I'm interested in how the show is put together, and that's why I'm really disappointed with the lack of bonus features on the DVD set. Previous seasons have had in-depth documentaries, cast and crew commentaries, and more. But with set we get a few featurettes on the set construction and visual effects of the show (which are pretty interesting), and the Scene Maker segments that were already available on the 24 website for free.     After looking at the special features on the 24 Complete Series DVD set, it seems most of the \\"goodbye\\" bits were saved for that set (including a Season 8 Wrap Party Reel, Jack Bauer: Evolution of a Hero, etc.). This really angers me that Fox only put those features on that set, because fans like me who ALREADY OWN the complete series of 24 don't want to shell out $180 to buy it again! Maybe when the entire series is finally released on Blu-Ray I'll consider buying it, but for now I'll live with the lackluster special features on this set.

006145205X|5.0|It's easy to get discouraged watching the fiscal slow motion train wreck consuming most western democracies. Will bankrupt Greece and Ireland take tottering France and Germany down with them? Will California and New York do the same to us here? As the electoral impetus to shower bankers with bailouts and voters with unfunded benefits empowers the profligate to eat the seed corn of the productive, only the long view offers respite from despair.    This makes Matt Ridley's \\"The Rational Optimist\\" the perfect read to start the New Year. Not since Julian Simon penned the \\"Ultimate Resource\\" has an author so perfectly captured the essence of why the human race will continue to progress despite the depredations of political overlords. Deftly refuting the pessimism of anti-trade zealots, neo-Malthusians, and eco-fundamentalists Ridley takes his readers on a wide ranging intellectual journey that explains how prosperity evolves.    At root lies a characteristic unique to the human species, what Adam Smith called the \\"propensity to truck, barter, and trade.\\" Many animals kill to snatch their sustenance, as man is sometimes wont to do. But only man engages in voluntary exchange with complete strangers, to the mutual benefit of both. Draw enough people into a web of exchange and the innovative power of specialization allows a thousand talents to bloom. Prosperity is nothing more than the steady march of specializing production and diversifying consumption.    Ridley starts by reviewing paleontological evidence suggesting that it was just this factor that allowed a new hominid from Africa to displace the Neanderthals dominating Europe. Big-brained though they were, small bands of Neanderthals possessing tools invariably made from materials within an hour's walk never mastered the art of socially aggregating and compounding progress across space and time. Our own ancestors escaped the grinding poverty of self sufficiency by learning to profit from trade, launching an unprecedented explosion that continues to this day.    Flint, ivory, shells, steatite, bone, lignite, pyrite - early man's trade goods passed hand-to-hand over long distances, ultimately giving the best flint chipper a large enough market to devote the bulk of his time to what he did best, earning his meat and hides from the best hunters and tanners. Ridley makes it clear that untrammeled trade became the engine of discovery and invention that prepared the ground first for agriculture then for civilization, not the other way around.    Wherever trade and specialization flourished, so did man. Where trade withered and self sufficiency returned, regression set in. Progress was invariably bottoms-up, societies constantly re-discovering the timeless truth that freedom, property, and a small body of mutually agreed upon rules and customs invariably outperform any and all forms of coercive central planning.    Of course, accumulated prosperity also attracted parasites, and it wasn't long before man got his first lessons in what happens when thieves evolve into priests and potentates. In case after case civilizations fell when the ruling class sought the plunder of war or the safety of stasis, promulgating taxes to finance the former and rules and regulations to choke off innovations that might threaten the latter.    Yet new civilizations persistently arose whenever a nexus of free trade emerged outside the reach of established warlords and kings. Phoenicia, Venice, Holland, the United States, each new periphery went on to become the center. The cycle of decline was doomed to repeat when these new civilizations were captured by rent-seeking overlords. Alas, Ridley offers no remedy for this affliction. Yet one is consoled by the thought that as long as freedom is alive somewhere the baton of progress will be passed.    Most amusing is Ridley's account of the parade of discredited pessimists that have marched through history, particularly in modern times where McArthur genius grants and Nobel Prizes await those who shout catastrophe the loudest. Free trade and free minds have lifted more people out of poverty in the last 50 years than ever before, yet \\"The generation that has experienced more peace, freedom, leisure time, education, medicine, travel, movies, mobile phones, and massages than any generation in history is lapping up gloom at every opportunity.\\" What does it mean when the president's science advisor can echo a Luddite statement like this and not be hooted off the national stage? \\"Isn't the only hope for the planet that industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn't it our responsibility to bring it about?\\"    Again and again history proves that the solution to secondary problems caused by technology is ... more technology. Nowhere is this more relevant than dealing with climate change. On this point Ridley is at his best. Taking the IPCC global warming predictions at face value he describes what the future might look like if the top-down remedies being prescribed by global elites are followed. He then compares this to a future where bottoms-up innovation is allowed to continue untrammeled.    Read it for yourself and decide which future you'd rather bequeath to your children.  [...]
B003ODL43M|5.0|It might have been a given that this album would be technically excellent (well arranged, mixed, performed) but, I do believe that BG have out done themselves on this one. It was also a nice treat to find the second disc with some really cool bonus material. You will want to own this one!
B002ZG977Y|4.0|An entertaining action movie with an interesting setting and just enough storyline to keep it engaging. The plot of this movie differs so much from the original than it's not really a remake at all, more of a Battlestar Galactica style \\"re-imagining\\". But it's still fun, whether you liked the original or not, and the CGI is, indeed, pretty impressive.
B00192IV9U|2.0|Yes, there are seven genuine Michael Jackson songs on this album and they're worth hearing.  Even though they were finished posthumously, the producers have done a great job in completing them.    HOWEVER...    The controversy is definitely true - \\"Keep Your Head Up\\", \\"Breaking News\\" and \\"Monster\\" are undoubtedly fake.  As proven a number of times around the Net, without any shadow of a doubt, the vocals on these tracks are work of a known Michael soundalike named Jason Malachi.  Malachi has denied any involvement, but comparisons between these and his own songs have shown him to be lying.  In fact, even his own manager insists that he sang these songs.    So just be warned ahead of time.  You are getting a handful of genuine unreleased Michael recordings, but you're also getting three ridiculous fakes.
B00406UK5A|3.0|I had been waiting to see this for over a year and I finally got it for x-mas this year.  As a Roman history buff, I eat up anything rome related, even stupid Hollywood films with little to no historical accuracy.  Going into this, I really wanted to like it, knowing full well it was a \\"B\\" movie.  However, I was disappointed at the end.      First, the good.  Costuming of the roman troops is spot on, one of the best depictions on film of legions in the high Principate era.  Battle sequences were good.  Yes, it was gory, but hey, thats how life was back then.  Good characterization for Quintus and Virulous.  Beautiful cinematogrophy and great landscape shots.  You can really tell that the actors were actually out in the cold freezing their curaises off.  Plot was generally good until the end.      Now, the bad.  Horrid, horrid dialogue.  Every word out of a character's mouth was a cliche.  They could have just spoke Latin, it wouldn't have mattered.  The bad dialogue also resulted in a lack of character development for other characters.  When all everyone but the main character says is f$!@; or I'd like to f#$@ her, it is rather difficult to relate to them.  Most of the rest of the survivors were not developed at all and you hardly noticed when they were picked off.  However, my biggest complaint was how disjointed the movie seemed.  I got the impression that the director filmed one movie and was then forced to re-cut and edit it to make an entirely new one.  Some of the scenes make little sense, and there is a feeling throughout that we were missing something.  The battle at Hadrian's wall made absolutely no sense to me, as the motivation of the last-minute villian was not ever explained.      I did not mind the ending, as some viewers did.  it fit with the theme of the film.  I do, however, wish they would have had more of a buildup to the final battle with the Picts.  I would have liked to have seen a \\"getting ready\\" montage before the attack and would have likedQuintus to actually come up with a battle plan and use to fort to out-trick the Picts.  This really killed the movie, as the final battle seemed like a non-event.  Also, poor editing reared its ugly head here once again, as main \\"villian\\" appears to fit outside the fort and watch her compatriots get slaughtered and only joins the fight at the end.    The use of CGI blood was way too over the top.  I don't mind blood, guts, and gore, but the CGI blood was used so extensively that it stood out and detracted from the realism of the film.  Finally, I do not undertand why the director messed with the historical timeline.  Agricola left Britain in 93 AD and Hadrian's wall was not started until 117 AD.  Furthermore, far from being an \\"invincible\\" legion, the 9th got its a$$ kicked during Budica's revolt.    All in all, I was entertained, but will probably not watch it again.
B0043URV8M|4.0|I love the music for the Harry Potter movies. I own all of the soundtracks and enjoy them all (for the most part). I still consider Prisoner of Azkaban to have the best score. I was hoping that John Williams would be able to return to finish the music that he originated, but that was not to be the case. Anybody would be better than Nicolas Hooper, who composed the bland music for the 5th and 6th movies. When I heard that Alexandre Desplat would be taking the reigns for this film (and Part 2), I was elated. He's one of the best non-John Williams composers working today. I previously enjoyed his score for The Golden Compass, which has a very similar tone to a Harry Potter film, so I was eagerly anticipating listening to his music for this one.     The music for this film is miles better than the music for the 4th, 5th, and 6th films. My favorite tracks include Obliviate, Snape to Malfoy Manor, Sky Battle, The Locket, Bathilda Bagshot, and The Deathly Hallows. Desplat does a good job balancing the music between the fast tracks for the action sequences (i.e. Sky Battle) and the slower, more subdued tracks (i.e. Ron's Speech).    There isn't a whole lot of continuity between this soundtrack and the previous films' soundtracks. Rarely is the \\"quintessential\\" Hedwig's Theme heard. This is fine with me. This film is much different than any of the previous Potter movies, so the music should be different as well, in my opinion. Desplat does a good job establishing new themes that are heard throughout the score. There are new themes for the death eaters, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione as a group, and for the Deathly Hallows.    Overall, I am very pleased with Desplat's score and I'm looking forward to hearing what he does with Part 2.

0930289331|1.0|I'm ready for the negative comments, but for young readers, lovers of Batman's detective work, and those who want a great plot - this is a DUD.    The visuals are outdated for today's readers - no, they're NOT 'classic,' they're dated. So you want some insights into humanity or a plot with great twists; this has no twists and no insights - it is a stylistic exercise PERIOD.     No mystery to solve, like The Long Halloween.    So if art, the World's Greatest Detective aspect of Batman, a great villain, and a clever plot AREN'T important to you, this is useless.    BUT it is historically important and sets a tone some readers like, so there is a vague duty among critics to talk it up. But be honest: not much actually happens. Batman: The Animated Series actually has better plots, and their very first episode is (in part) a takeoff on this story, but with many more elements. Skip the hype, or read it first in the library, trust me.

0596805888|4.0|Cooking for Geeks is the cooking book for the rest of us.  It is the book that was written for those of us who do not naturally feel comfortable in the kitchen.  It is the book that was written for those of us who want to know; Why does that happen? and Why do I need to do that in a certain order?<br /><br />Jeff takes the reader through the science of cooking, through theory and plenty of examples in the forms of recipes, ranging from simple to complex.  While the book focuses on the scientific reasoning behind what happens in the kitchen, Jeff does in an amusing and non-threatening manner.<br /><br />Each chapter is organized in straightforward manner.  Jeff starts off the book by talking about what equipment you should have in your kitchen, then about taste and smell, what happens when food is cooked, baking and gluten to ending talking about commercial and modern cooking methods.  In each case, he does it in a manner that exposes the reader to new concepts in an easy to understand method with examples and the science behind the concept.<br /><br />Along with the science behind kitchen concepts, Jeff provides enough recipes for the reader to utilize in their everyday life, ranging in complexity from simple cooking of eggs to a more complex example of Seared Mussels.  This to me is one of the selling points to the book.  Too many times, cooking books focus on either the simple or complex and do not make it seem as though a kitchen novice would not be able to handle something more complex than making cereal and toast.  This is not the case here, with each recipe explained in a straightforward manner that would allow even the kitchen novice to feel comfortable doing something more complex in the kitchen.<br /><br />Along with a multitude of recipes and scientific explanations, Jeff interviews famous people about their experiences in the kitchen.  These experts range from Adam Savage of Mythbusters fame to pastry chef Dave Lebovitz from Berkley.  This adds to the rich content of the book by giving an outside perspective on cooking and kitchen science/cooking.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book to novice and experienced home cooks.  Jeff has tips and tricks that can be utilized by all level of home cooks without insulting or frustrating either group.an outside perspective on cooking and kitchen science/cooking.

031603438X|4.0|I like music, a lot, but am not a big Stones fan or expert.  Probably have a half-dozen Stones songs on my IPod, and all old enough to be on Hot Rocks. And I don't play guitar.  So, I don't know everything about the Stones or about the different guitar styles and so forth.  Nonetheless, I found this a compelling memoir that held my interest.  The book had peaks and valleys.  Richards is fascinated by ordinary portions of his youthful memories, and the book is pretty slow, until the Stones get going.  At other points, there are dull celebrity name-dropping stories.  For the most part, though, you are treated to Richards' genuine perspective on his own life and the band.  His philosophy, his relationship to women, his drug use and addiction, his relation to authority, his relation to Mick Jagger.  Some thoughts:  Richards' life is very Richards-centric.  While he is rarely alone (always in a relationship, always surrounded by friends and cronies) his life is about HIM.  His kids, his women, his bandmates are all seen in relation to Richards.  I would describe him as narcissistic, except without the grandiosity.  Second, I'm left liking and not liking him.  He is cool, to be sure, fun to hang out with, and with a moral code you can sort of respect, but also childish, selfish, short-tempered and out of control.  Third, the discussion of his drug addiction is interesting and, I think, honest, but I never get a true understanding of its root cause, an apparent need to be out of it, through decades of success (to an almost fatal degree).  It's not for fun, but why?  One gets no insight on that question, which makes one feel something is missing.  Fourth, the relationship with Mick Jagger comes towards the end of the book---worth the wait!  He casts Jagger as the Diva, consistently using unflattering names for women in his description of Jagger, but Richards' own reaction is much more of the woman scorned.  In any event, fun stuff.  Fifth, the memoir has other players'in Richards' life tell little parts of the story that they witnessed.  It is a fun and enlightening technique, used to excellent effect.  Finally, Richards does a wonderful job describing his creative process.  The Rolling Stones and Richards have had an extraordinary lengthy period of creativity and artistic freshness.  How do they keep it up, keep it going, through all those decades and all that drama?  There is no magical answer, but Richards does give you a true understanding, which makes the book ultimately satisfying.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|I totally get why so many fans of the action/assassin/tough guy genre were disappointed. I really get it.<br /><br />And I even get why so many were turned off by the whole 'european' take - the quiet, somber and introspective tone of the film. Believe me, I count action flicks as favorites, so I get it.<br /><br />But this was still an incredible movie experience. And the reason is: It's more true to life than so many of the ubiquitous blood-n-guts-flying-everywhere-and-on-everyone movies that dominates the genre today.<br /><br />This was \\"real\\" in the sense that this is the life of a genuine assassin. It's not glorious, not James Bond, not Tarantino, not living on free & easy street - it's bleeping business, pure and plainly simple.<br /><br />The morbid dryness, the lonely paranoid existence with little beyond fiscal compensation to comfort you - that's the point. Choosing the business of killing means that you're not going to get a normal life - not by a long shot. No pun intended.<br /><br />The proverb about still waters running deep is exemplified in this film.<br /><br />If you're a true fan of wetwork films - I highly recommend it.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|I have no problem giving MBDTF a 3 or 4 star review. Kanye, more than most rappers, knows how to structure rap as actual music with melodic changes and exciting highs and lows. It has texture, it is not just monochrome beats. But what I can't figure out is how critics could put a CD with a song as vulgar as \\"Blame Game\\" on every top ten list imaginable. It should have been kept off the top ten lists and 5 star reviews and every critic should have said \\"Chris Rock's lousy section on Blame Game is the reason why\\". Lost In The World, Monster, Runaway are very good and most songs have a lot going for them and are interesting enough to keep on my iPod and keep in the mix. But Kanye made IMO a really bad decision on Blame Game to let Mr. Dirty Mouth ruin his song and he must be called on it and penalized for it.     I know as an older person not in love with rap I might not get it though. But I am glad I have it. Just beware it should be categorized as good or very good, but not great.

B000UR9T82|5.0|First, a review of the movies. The first Spider-Man movie, while occasionally deviating from the original storyline, was a great movie. It was mostly true to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original tale of the web-slinger. It pulled on the Norman Osborn/Green Goblin storylines and was really enjoyable.<br /><br />The second movie was more goodness and was also really well done. This time we are introduced to Doctor Octopus and we see the beginnings of Harry Osborn going crazy (to later become the second Green Goblin).<br /><br />The third movie was pretty bad, and I am a huge Spider-Man fan. While I really wanted to see Venom as the villain for the third movie, his whole story arc didn't mesh well with the Sandman/Green Goblin arc. And it also didn't help that Topher Grace played the part of Eddie Brock. All I could see is the kid from That 70's Show (not to say anything bad about Topher or the show, I liked them both). But since when was Eddie Brock a puny kid with a grudge? And what's with the symbiote lifting to show his face all the time? This movie had so much potential, but failed to be up to the quality of its predecessors.<br /><br />As for the blu-ray trilogy, it looks amazing! The quality and clarity of the picture is truly great. The only negative I have against the trilogy is the lack of special features for the first movie. With the amount of space on a blu-ray disc, I'm surprised to see so little.
B00G33U7L0|4.0|Yes...a tale of Beowulf, the mighty hero from gothland that will kill the monster that terrorizes the Danes. I said a tale, not THE tale. In many events and motivators it differs from the known poem from the early medieval period. The writers (including the great Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary) &#34;defend&#34; themselves stating that obviously the known poem was already heavily adapted (christhian references in 5th century scandinavia is an obvious adaptation, they were pagans); so this is a story based on the character Beowulf - it doesn't follow exactly the poem (I'm repeating this as a warning to purists - BEWARE).<br /><br />For those who want to see an epic story, ancient/medieval morality (Beowulf is brave, boisterous, lier, loud and proud, he doesn't follow exactly our &#34;nice&#34; code of conduct or morality), a film with great actors, fantastic special efects and an interesting adapted story, I strongly advise this DVD.<br /><br />The extras are worthy, it's impressive how complex is making a 3D CGI film! The suits are quite curious, the scanning sessions, the magnificent concept art, etc. The only extras that aren't that interesting are the cut scenes (they don't add a lot to the story and they are in an embrionary state of imaging development).<br /><br />Why didn't I gave it a 5 star rating?<br /><br />Although I understand the concept of adaptation, this one went a little to far (SPOILER WARNING):<br /><br />Beowulf King of the Danes??? Father of the Dragon??? It was interesting the concept of responsability for our own weaknesses or failings, but that wasn't at all in the original poem! But please, watch the movie with an open mind, you probably will enjoy it a lot.

Considering the fact that Dirty Harry was made in 1971, this Blu-Ray looks like the film was just shot last week. Sound quality is also amazing. Thankfully the audio on the Mus & EFX is only slightly higher than the dialogue. Too many dvd and Blu-Rays double or triple the volume on the M&E. I watch these discs at home not the cineplex. My neighbors appreciate the lack of BOOMS bleeding through.    This set has many wonderful bonuses but for the features themselves, it is more than worth it!!!!    Go ahead, make your own day. You will feel lucky, PUNK!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I cannot WAIT to get my hands on it!  I thought the movie was exquisite when it first came out (I was in a midnight preview showing in 3D), then the extended version was even better.  I understand that Cameron is working on parts II & III now.
B0000089A1|5.0|It is amazing how much better this remaster sounds compared to the non-remastered version by Reprise.  I love the Kinks anyway but have gained an entirely new appreciation for this gem of an album because of the remaster.  The song that benefits the most imo is \\"This Time Tomorrow\\".  This acoustic strumming beauty has great definition and instrument separation in the remaster vs a completely muddy sound in the earlier version.  The rockers like \\"Powerman\\", \\"Top of the pops\\" and \\"Rats\\" really pop.  A great album and possibly the Kinks best overall.  Not really a weak song on the entire album and some great lyrics that one can now hear clearly!!
B0015DROBO|1.0|I do not think i need to say any more.  The title pretty much sums it up.  I started reading the book with high expectations.  heard it was great from my friends.  read it and...  Maybe it just was NOT the right book for me.  Or maybe it was just the book itself.  I must say this book was a waste of my time and money.  Also i will not be reading the next books in the series or any other books written by this author.
B002ZG974M|3.0|Babies unreels the first year of life of four new members of the homo sapiens tribe.  From Namibia to Mongolia to Japan to the USA, the babies are adorable, naturally, and fun to watch as they begin to develop their personalities,  which remain remarkably consistent three years later when, in a bonus feature on the DVD, the film maker visits the four families three years later.   They poop, throw small tantrums, get into slightly dangerous fixes, and learn to stand and, in some cases, walk.  But, for me, Babies relies too much on gorgeous exterior shots of Mongolian open space and feels awfully long despite being under 80 minutes.  Think of it as a home movie times four that proud parents sit their guests down to over after-dinner coffee.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK!  It is way better than the original Percy Jackson series.  I can`t wait for the next book to come out. Sadly the series will be finished by the time i turn sixteen:(.  Keep writing Rick Riordan!!!!!
B004G6009K|5.0|I was not terribly enthusiastic about seeing TANGLED, and in fact, I didn't see it for several weeks.  But a slow Sunday afternoon came around, and having seen pretty much everything else...I was coaxed into attending.  And now the film is on my Top 10 for 2010 list!    This is a Disney picture, with the graphic sensibilities of a Pixar film.  I know the two companies are allied, but what I mean is this:  Pixar has had the corner on smart, modern looking, genre-twisting films.  Nary a fairy-tale in sight.  And Disney has the lock on the \\"princess\\" fairy tale.  Heroine tackles adventures, including some kind of wicked witch-type character, with the help of her animal sidekicks and to a greater-or-lesser degree, the help of a male character destined to be her one true love.  And generally, the Disney movie is in the old, hand-drawn style (such as the excellent PRINCESS AND THE FROG).    But with TANGLED, we get a terrific \\"princess\\" story, coupled with outstanding CGI animation from Pixar.  It's in 3D, and features the best 3D of the year, in my opinion.  There's a gorgeous scene where thousands of paper lanterns are released into the night sky at once, and as they carry over a lake, their number is multiplied by the reflection in the water.  The moment is jaw-dropping in its beauty...and to be honest, it's worth the price of the 3D upgrade.      TANGLED is the story (loosely) of Rapunzel...the girl who is kept in a tall tower by a wicked old woman who accesses the tower by climbing Rapunzel's LOOOONG hair.  In this film, Rapunzel isn't merely rescued by a roaming prince.  She's spunky, smart and naïve about the world about her.  She yearns to leave, even for a short time...and when fate puts a reluctant rescuer in her path (in the form of Flynn Rider...a charming bandit), she sets off on an adventure full of excitement, humor & romance.  And Rapunzel, with her blonde hair and green eyes, looks refreshingly different from Disney beauties of the past.    It sounds very tired...but trust me, Disney makes all the old stand-by themes seem new and fresh.  The animal sidekicks:  a cute-as-can-be chameleon and a tough-as-nails horse.  Song about yearning to see another part of the world:  yep, but it's cute and touching.  Colorful villains: check, but this gang gets to sing one of the funniest songs since Gaston used antlers in his decorating in BEAUTY & THE BEAST.  Chase scenes:  a couple of good ones, including one featuring a collapsing dam.  Pretty scenery:  yep.  This movie has it all.    There are minor problems here and there.  A king and queen who never speak for some reason.  Flynn looks vaguely generic (he's a fun character, though).  But really, the film delivered all I could hope for.  See it...and don't just drag the kids; bring the adults too!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|PPLES.  how can you not like this book?  I read the whole thing in one day!  How can you say RR stop writing this series and write it again! I cant wait for the next book to come out( IT COMES OUT ON MY BIRTDHAY!!!!!!).  Until then DONT WRITE BAD REVIEWS BCUZ THIS IZ DA BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!
B000NDI3SK|5.0|i bought this dvd set as a gift for my father, and he loves it!! he highly recommends it to all history buffs, or anyone in general actually. :) he is very pleased, and so am i.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I think that this is a movie that is most enjoyed by it's intended niche audience. I don't have any children, but I'm really into the whole nature vs nurture thing. This movie was an awesome exploration of it. I actually found the almost zero dialog and narration to be the best part, despite the fact that it turned some people off. Maybe my Early Childhood Education degree helped me understand the point of the movie, but I got it immediately and loved it. I hope this guy makes more minimal-talking documentaries, in the future.
B004047XXO|3.0|I bought this for my 3D tv, not realizing it's \\"fake 3d\\" with the old-school red and green glasses included (to be watched on any tv).  And the quality is bad, while wearing the glasses totally ruins the colors of the movie.  So we watched the regular version.    It's a cute movie - not nearly as good as the first one and I suppose similar to the 2nd one.  At times the story seemed to be \\"too much\\" with one extreme situation occuring after another and the overall story being pretty lame.  Even the Skat (squirrel) character was boring and his story-line was really, really stupid.  Whereas he was the highlight in the first 2 Ice Age movies.  Sigh...
B00319ECGU|5.0|I purchased this for my dad for Christmas.  When he opened it, he went bonkers.  Can't beat the price, it was ~$30 cheaper than if I bought it at Best Buy.  Shipped very quickly and arrived in excellent condition, factory sealed.
0307272702|5.0|Fat is the last politically correct prejudice.  It's okay to malign people who are overweight for their laziness and lack of discipline.  It's just fine to acknowledge you aren't hiring a qualified candidate because of their weight. Physicians and public health experts publicly complain about these obese people who apparently lack rudimentary knowledge of their own obesity and don't comply with their (unscientific) dictims. And nowadays, we even pass those prejudices on to our children.  The campaign against childhood obesity would be a great idea if any of its proponents had the least notion of what to do to actually prevent childhood obesity. Sorry, eating your vegetables is not going to do it.  The only thing we know is that the earlier children go on their first diet, the more likely they are to grow into obese adults.  Thanks to the campaign against childhood obesity, we are seeing parents of children as young as 2 putting them on diets--thus ironically exacerbating the long term obesity epidemic in our country.<br /><br />Gary Taubes argues beautifully for the humanity and dignity--and competence and intelligence!-- of those of us who have never been able to attain an ideal weight. He is articulate and courageous in standing up against this last bastion of acceptable prejudice in our country. He makes his case with cold hard facts and science.  Many of the studies he cites in this terrific book and in his earlier work Good Calories Bad Calories, perplexed the researchers themselves.  They expected saturated fat to cause heart disease and obesity-- but it didn't in their studies.  They expected that if you ate less and exercised more you would lose weight at a certain rate, as if our bodies are mathematical equations. That didn't happen either. When their own research failed to confirm their own mistaken assumptions, how did the researchers react?  Did they say it's time to revisit our assumptions about fat and health?  No, that's left to Gary Taubes. Most researchers conclude that their paradoxical results suggest that more research is needed, to try to confirm these prejudiced assumptions with some kind of new methodology. The result: lots and lots of research and money spent, and no answers in a raging obesity epidemic ironically caused in part by our dogged refusal to question our prejudiced assumptions. Gary Taubes does not claim to have all the answers, but he sure knows the right questions.<br /><br />I've been on a low-carb diet for many years.  It's one of the toughest diets, even though it's the only diet I've been on that doesn't cause hunger.  The problem is the diet is so outside the mainstream of American cultural assumptions about health and weight.  Your friends, family, restaurant workers, and the food industry just don't get it.  If they aren't wondering about your sanity ordering a sandwich without the bread, they are lecturing you about how you are endangering your health by foregoing the skim milk and the low fat mac and cheese. It's a daily struggle! Yet the very fact that the diet is so outside the mainstream suggests it might be onto something.  After all, the mainstream notion of healthy eating has prevailed in a time of obesity and heart disease unprecedented in human history.<br /><br />Gary Taubes gives us in his two books a brilliant compendium of the science behind low-carb living, and in doing so he exposes the myths and prejudices about people who are overweight. I am grateful to him for his boldness and his willingness to stand up to conventional wisdom. It has not been easy. It has made a huge difference in my life and I hope it will help turn the corner in the research, so the next generation of Americans will prevail against obesity, instead of pointing accusatory fingers at the obese.rs conclude that their paradoxical results suggest that more research is needed, to try to confirm these prejudiced assumptions with some kind of new methodology.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|man this is honestly the second best book ive ever read.Dashner does really good in keepin the readers glued to the book but he should finish the third book soon cause im dieing to read it!!!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|What a terrific book! I was hooked from the beginning and could hardly put my Kindle down. Jodi is such an excellent writer and had me totally involved with all the characters from the start. One minute I am heartbroken for Em's parents and the next I am feeling the same for Chris and his family. Hated for it to end but couldn't wait to find out the truth of what happened.
B00280LYIC|2.0|I personally thought that Riordan tried too hard to create the laughs found in every chapter,title, and page. I think Riordan had the right idea but in my personal opinion a few changes need to be made...   I like the way he joined mythology with the modern world but thought that the flurry my friends made over the book was pointless.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Great acting, the filming is top notch and looks impressive on Blu-Ray.  Added bonus to get the combo pack in the mail by Amazon.  Package made it to my house fast and I got to watch it instantly on demand through a promo by Amazon.  Very satisfied with my purchase and I am thankful that the movie lived up to expectations!  Leo D is the best in the business and pairs with Chris Nolan's screenplay perfectly.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|If you were ever looking for a board game that just about anyone can play, features a good balance between strategy and chance then this is the game for you. While the game initially looks intimidating due to the volume of pieces it has, the game play per round is actually very simple and fun.     The build quality is a mixed bag. On the one hand the playing pieces are wood and have a great feel to them, the board however is cardboard which makes the longevity questionable. One other downfall is that it requires three or four people to play. Not more and not less, but if you get the right people together you are in for a true treat as you quickly get into a fun round accusing players and trading with them.     Excellent game.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|If you have never seen Fringe and love sci-fi about time travel, then you will love Fringe. Great writers - great ideas.
B001F3FUK6|1.0|The writers were unable to leave out their politics. Even though it may have cost them millions of dollars in lower sales.    Prior to this movie, Superman was for: \\"Truth, Justice, and the American way\\".    In this version, we get \\"Truth, Justice, and all that stuff\\".  I don't know what kind of motivation or agenda the writers, director, producers have, but I am SORELY disappointed in their cowardice in changing what an American icon Superman has been.    Truth, Justice, and the American Way is not inane, it's idealistic optimism, which is exactly what Superman is.    And then we get this line from Lois Lane: \\"The world doesn't need a Savior\\".    You will find none of this type of dialogue in any of the  previous Superman presentations.    Had they left their politics at home this would be a 4 or 5 star movie.
B002RL7W9W|4.0|what a great toy for a young boy/girl with imagination!  a gift, so I don't know how the 8 year old will like it, but it's what was requested!  received this in great shape and in a timely fashion!

B003XKPPOU|1.0|I try and buy 3D movies for my grandkids. I buy this movie because it is listed in the 3D section on Amazon. 4 disc so I thought it must be 3D! Right? WRONG! NO 3D WHY IS IT IN THE 3D SECTION? I HAVE NO IDEA AND NO ONE AT AMAZON SEEMS TO KNOW ALSO. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 3D DON'T BUY THIS ONE!
B0012U7QTU|5.0|I loved this novel which follows characters over a span of time. I was doubtful that the author could deliver an ending that would be satisfying after making the reader so curious to know what really happened on a long-ago fateful day. But she did...the finale was terrific! This is one of the few books I'd ever want to read again.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|These headphones have excellent sound and work as advertised. They are so clear you can hear where your opponent is coming from and be waiting in CODBO. They won't make you an allstar but may increase you from mediocre to average at least.  Only complaint I have is that if your going to be playing for extended periods buy some rechargeable batteries. This headset burns through your standard AAA in no time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book and its series are right up there with Harry Potter and Rhold Dhal books. Please rad these books and see for yourself!
142311339X|4.0|I'm going to say I liked this book, but holy cow was it poorly edited! I found at least 5 missing words, words that were wrong and just overall poor sentence structure. The first half of the book was fairly good, but most of these mistakes happenend in the second half. No offense to the author, but it appears the editor simiply got distracted. With that said, though, I look forward to the next one and Percy's reappearance.
0756405890|5.0|I read this book twice and each time was great.  It flows well and keeps you interested no matter what is happening on the page.  I highly recommend it for fantasy and non-fantasy fans alike.
0316044695|5.0|If you ever wondering what it was like for our military, particularly someone from an elite SEAL team fighting in Afghanistan, then this book is for you.  It is also so much more.  Meet Marcus Luttrell who was trained as a SEAL deployed to Afghanistan to fight the bad guys.  The story describes his SEAL training, his unwavering patriotism (which is a common trait amongst warriors), his deployment, and the mission he was on with 3 other men when they were attacked by over a hundred Taliban.  They fought back, killing over 50 Taliban, but his other 3 teammates lost their lives.  He was the only survivor.  He spent 5 days MIA in hostile territory and was taken in by a local tribe and eventually the Rangers found him.  The book goes much into much more detail about all these events and I was riveted.<br /><br />I was struck by a couple of themes in this book.  First, the work that our best fighting forces are willing to do on the behalf of the USA is amazing.  They will go anywhere at any time willingly and without question.  They would do what 99.99% of the rest of us would not do.  And second, they would be a lot better at what they did if not for the second guessing and criticizing that they receive from our own media.  Three Navy SEAL members would be alive today if they were not hampered by potential repercussions of a situation they found themselves in on that last fateful mission.  This is expounded on quit eloquently by Mr. Luttrell himself.<br /><br />I am inspired by his faith and the miraculous that took place on that mission.  An example was him never losing his rifle during moments that clearly did not make sense.  He fell down the mountain a few times and bingo, there was his rifle right next to him.<br /><br />Despite some colorful language, overall a great book!  Every American should be grateful for what these men are willing to do to keep this great country free.
0452286751|2.0|Seriously, though: while this book had some interesting ideas, a few great scenes, and good development of the more secondary characters, it mostly made me happy I did not live in Rand's world with these stilted people.  I'm happy living in a world with shades of gray.<br /><br />I would give it 3 stars, because Ayn Rand obviously worked very hard on this book and creating the world within it, but it was too longwinded and repetitive.<br /><br />As for Howard Roark, as a character he is uneven at best.  He had some nice moments, especially when he was kind to the un-appreciated sculptor.  For most of the novel, Howard is boring but confident enough in his talents that he does not care if the world recognizes them.  But that character bears no resemblence to the Howard who rapes Dominique (and yes, I know this has been debated, but the scene as written is rape and Dominique even states very late in the novel and matter-of-factly that \\"he raped me\\") and later goes on to commit another crime that seems driven by ego. Readers have twisted themselves into knots trying to explain Howard, but the reality is that Rand tried to pack all her ideals and fantasies into this one character, and ended up with a contradictory mess.<br /><br />Dominique is just disturbed in the head, quite frankly. Instead of using her wealth and writing skills to make herself happy, she wastes YEARS of her life being miserable because she believes most of the world is mediocre and conformist, and marries not one but two men that repulse her in some perverse protest against the world.  She loves Howard (rape notwithstanding, or maybe even because of it - seriously, she needes help), but is on some quest to defeat him before the rest of the world can do so.  She engages in a lot of self-nullifying behavior and I cannot see her as an ideal or a heroine.
0312600844|4.0|If you can stomach a novel that takes a long, hard, uncomfortable look at the lives of white, privileged, Prius-driving, NPR-listening, middle-class Americans (including people like the author himself, it seems), you might find Freedom an impressive literary accomplishment. Franzen, without a doubt, shows an incisive understanding of the way people make and rationalize bad decisions, then later find them difficult to live with. He pushes his characters to make those bad decisions, lighting a fire under the resentment and frustrations that white, privileged, Prius-driving people often have simmering under the surface, forcing it to boil over. On a scene-by-scene level, the way the characters struggle with each other, themselves, their neighbors, and the country as a whole is believably complex and readable. I often felt frustrated and annoyed with Franzen's protagonists, but the messiness of their lives also felt familiar to me, and part of me wanted them to succeed.  I think that many of the reviewers who attack the book's believability are confusing reasonable behavior and realism. Based on my decade-and-a-half of being an adult, depressed people really do act like Patty, frustrated environmentalists really can turn into seething cranks a la Walter, angry sons sometimes do move out of the family home after big fights, like Joey, and aging free spirits do flit between relationships in a Richard-like way. And it's not hard to dig up real-life examples of shady Iraq war profiteering similar to the one here. It may be a dramatized, \\"literary\\" version of America, but it's the real America.  That said, I do understand a little of the backlash. Some characters are a little uneven and/or stereotype-ish, and could have been better fleshed out -- for example, Connie is a bit of a blank outside her unhealthy relationship to Joey. Though, as a liberal, I thought Franzen could be pretty honest about some of the inconsistencies of the American liberal, there were times when he seemed to be using Walter's heavy-handed rants as a proxy for his own letter-to-the-editor frustrations. And there's the matter of the ending, in which the characters redeem themselves perhaps a little too neatly (though, after the infamous poop and ring scene, the reader may have endured enough ugliness, and might be feeling ready for a turning point). As for the audiobook narrator, his arch tone will either fit the novel, or further compound what people already don't like about it.  Is Freedom the Great American Novel critics want it to be? To me, it doesn't quite have the lyricism, timelessness, and emotional resonance to add itself to history in that way, but I think it's at least a great American novel for right now. Franzen is a skillful and honest writer and there's a lot of insight in Freedom's (many) pages. One of my best reads from 2010.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|There really isn't much more to say once you see this film. You should be mad and actually downright on the verge of taking up arms and forming community 'groups' for lack of a better term to do something about some of this, but ...<br /><br />you won't.<br /><br />And that's the saddest reality and the most painful message in all of this. Add in that the folks that Michael Moore is talking about have successfully turned his name into a symbol of the ultimate pariah making this very clear message even harder to be acknowledged, injested and acted upon.<br /><br />The infrastructure that Moore is reporting upon used to run in fear that this kind of information would be privvy to the mainstream media, but these days they've already figured where everybody stands, how much stomach most people have to fight and by keeping everyone hard at work, it'll make it harder for them to seek out the barest amount of respect in the world for themselves and their families. They know that - for you - the viewer, it's just more consumable media that you'll entertain yourselves with so that you can sleep in a numb haze at night and forget that this place is really in for darker times in the near short term.<br /><br />I read most of the negative reviews of this film and it really is hard to nay-say the information or try to GOP coat-tail and uphold the 'dead peasant' insurance policies, the massive lay-off's during economic booms and the out-right unethical looting that took place by Wall Street ... unless of course you're Tucker Carlson or some other emotionally detached human being with a huge trust-fund or just grossly uneducated in common sense or basic ecomonics.<br /><br />The fact that this film has been out for some time and a lot of people have never even seen it, or wanted to see it, should be an indication as to what's really going on around us. Yes, I finally included myself in this.<br /><br />There's a scene where a little dog is jumping up and down at the dinner table hoping for some food scraps from their owner to fall their way and Moore equates those folks struggling for their vision of the American Dream to be that dog, and the bankers and corporations are the people looking at the dog and doing everything they can to keep the dog in its place. Quite fitting and quite simple.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how you feel about Michale Moore, because you should put that aside and watch this film. You'll learn that he, too, is an American and his father worked in an American factory his whole life giving Michael and his siblings the ideal American life. Michael started his life in film-making by trying to document what went on in the Automobile industry during the Reagan years and which now, has come full circle and fully played itself out - and in the worst possible scenario imaginable.<br /><br />This is a really difficult film to watch because Ronald Reagan isn't the hero, Jimmy Carter becomes the  voice of doom, the death of FDR becomes the turning point in American History for the worst, Bill Clinton sets up some of the pieces of the puzzle that makes the nightmare possible and George Bush just doubles down on all of it multiplying our troubles ad infinitum. This is not a happy film and you're left to just hate the situation and all those involved and there is no answer at the end. This whole thing goes down like Henry V, but with a horrible outcome where Scroop, Grey and Westmoreland actually succeed in selling out the country for loose coin.<br /><br />The film is like the Chimes at Midnight.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I ordered season 1 of Community one evening when I was on twitter and someone tweeted that Amazon had the disk set on sale, along with a promo code to take a % off.  I have to say that Community, in a tight race against Modern Family, was my favorite tv comedy of 2010.  For those that purchase this, make sure to go back and watch/listen to the cast commentary on each episode.  I recommend this for all comedy dvd sets.  Listening to the cast and crew crack jokes at one another, and tell what went into making the episodes is a great bonus.  You also get to hear how episodes were aired out of order, etc.  5 stars all the way!

030746363X|1.0|I was skeptical, but bought this book on the basis of the overwhelming positive reviews and the free sample, which very carefully doesn't give you any of the techniques. Also, in all honesty, I've just got a Kindle and the novelty of being able to get books instantly has led me to buy a little more impulsively than I normally would. When I got into the actual content where he provides advice about how to achieve what you want, I realized my mistake. It's a depressing mix of stating the obvious, embracing bad science, and always going to potentially unhealthy extremes. A heavy restriction/binge cycle, for instance, is a not a good or sustainable diet; it's disordered eating.  It left the bad taste of snake oil in my mouth, and I'm returning it for a refund.
B004G6009K|5.0|My daughter age 6 and I went to see Tangled in theaters (regular version).We liked it so much we also saw it in 3D a week later. We laughed and cried through out the movie. One of my top 5 for Disney!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the best I have listened to in recent memory.  I had high hopes for the movie after having listened to this album quite a bit beforehand.  The music is sweeping, epic and intense.  It captures the \\"essense\\" of Tron quite nicely and really brought the imagery to life for me (in my head at least)!  Unfortunately, I don't think the movie quite lived up to the expectations I'd built around the music.  It wasn't a bad movie to be sure, but it was disappointing after falling in love with the soundtrack like I did.  Daft Punk did an excellent job and they made a smart move in drawing inspiration from the likes of Hans Zimmer and David Powell when writing this score.  Some of it has a very similar feel to the Batman: Dark Knight and Inception soundtracks by Zimmer, which is not at all a bad thing (both scores are fantastic!).  There are moments in the movie where an increase in the soundtrack's volume would have helped bring the movie to life much more.  I found that the music was a bit lost in certain scenes, which was disappointing.    I can't say enough good things about the Tron soundtrack and it's well worth picking up for the paltry amount Amazon is charging for the digital download.  Even without the extra tracks mentioned in another review, you're getting a lot of great music for your money.  I rate this album highly recommended!
B002PLALCO|5.0|I bought this DVD for my father because he's a big music lover. He enjoys heavy metal, hard rock, screamo, etc. He absolutely loves this DVD, despite the fact that it is pop music. It was his favorite Christmas present!
143911000X|4.0|Got it in great shape, Its an awesome book. I finished it in 2 hours, didn't take my eyes of it for one second! I fully recommend it for both girls and boys!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I took advantage of Amazon's great $10 offer for season 1.  Really impressed by the acting and the storytelling.   While the depiction of the early 60's isn't very realistic (beyond style),  this is still excellent television.  If you want something with a bit more intelligence than most of whats out there,  I recommend it.
B002C1BHIO|2.0|I used the HDMI cable on a PS3 to a Sony HD TV.  I installed it in April of 2010 and while using my playstation and switching from Netflix to DVD the screen went black.  Turns out the cable went dead.  Bought a Sony HDMI cable and works great.
0756665949|5.0|This item is a must for any Lost fan. It details so much from the show and is very informative. I love it
B00005AQE8|5.0|this was a good purchase.i got it for black friday, so it was 1/2 price. and i received it in good conditions.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Watched this while chillin over the holidays, great fun. Sandy B does a bang up job as a boss from h*ll. Reynolds matched her comedic skill look for look, barb by barb. They are two very funny actors. Betty White of course steals every scene she's in, man she's a riot. The Proposal has tons of laughs, some wickedly funny scenes and while I find the ending a bit Hollywood, it's still entertaining. Recommended!
B0044XV3R8|1.0|I bought 2 copies of Avatar special edition...one for me one for my sister...and I returned mine, due to  scratches that were there when opened and interrupted the movie, completely freezing it at times! My sister had the same errors on her DVDs(less severe).The replacement copy I was sent also had scratches that cause skipping...that's 3 badly handled DVD's. I think its the DVD designers fault...since the DVD is encased in an envelope slide out (where it can slide around). They were very small scratches, like sand or dirt had gotten stuck in there and rubbed against the DVD 100 times, most were the size of about this - .  It was really disappointing.  The packaging was really pretty.  It doesn't do its job of protecting the DVD.  Id rather durability and proper working order more than aesthetic appeal ...Please!  All three would be proper :)
B0011Z5CV0|4.0|I was expecting it to be a little bit bigger based on the customer images. Maybe, some of the babies are just smaller than mine so it made it look bigger. Anyway, our baby likes it a lot but I do wish the music played longer. It is a glorified stuffed animal, but if it makes her happy then I am happy.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Last Christmas, I received a Blu-Ray player and a small set of movies to get started. These films are Toy Story 3, Batman 1989, The Back to the Future 25th Anniversary Trilogy, and last but not least, The Ultimate Matrix Collection.  This set includes The Matrix, Reloaded, Revolutions, Animatrix, and the Matrix Experience with an abundance of special features and documentaries, as well as a commemorative booklet describing the features.  Unlike the HD-DVD version of this set, it has the 3-part Matrix Trilogy Revisited features and Animatrix in true High Definition, like quality over quantity.  The cases are super thin and help save storage space.  Here are my personal opinions of the films.    The Matrix (1999, 9.4)    The one that started it all and indeed the best of the series.  It was groundbreaking for the time with state-of-the-art special effects, cool action scenes, top-notch acting, and complex story that would keep you thinking in a computer world where anything goes.  It involves computer programmer Thomas Anderson who has a double life as a hacker under the alias of Neo (Keanu Reeves) teaming up with the Nebuchanezzer captain Morpheous (Laurence Fishburne), infamous hacker and Neo's love interest Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and the rest of the crew trying to learn about the secrets of the Matrix while trying to evade the trio of nefarious agents led by Smith (Hugo Weaving) and crew traitor Cypher (Joe Pantoliano).  Behind the cool concept, the plot is kind of like a basic underdog film in lieu of Star Wars, Total Recall, Rocky, The Karate Kid, Terminator series, Slumdog Millionaire, Avatar, some of Disney's animated films, you name it, but still overall enjoyable.    The Animatrix (2003, 9.0)    A great and informative compilation of animated segments that go deeper into the back-story and mythyos of the series with varying kinds of Japanese and computer animation listed below.    *Final Flight of the Osiris - Shown in theaters with Dreamcatcher and involves the Osiris crew discovering that the sentinels have found Zion and are about to launch an attack and one of the members, Jue, sends a message to Zion in the Matrix while the sentinels attack them and destroy the ship. It was made by Squaresoft with excellent and detailed CGI animation from Final Fantasy: the Spirit Within.    *The Second Renaissance - A two part back-story of the origins of the human vs. machine feud, when the machines started rebelling against humans and using them for infinite energy after they made a giant black cloud to block the sun, and how the Matrix came to be.    *Kid's Story - A segment involving Kid being chased by the Agents at school after receiving an invitation from Neo to leave the Matrix and how he escaped the Matrix by apparently committing suicide without a red pill.  Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Clayton Watson are the only three actors from the trilogy to return for this special, let alone the Animatrix compilation in general.  The first Matrix movie hints at the rare and nearly impossible self-substantiation and this, along with World Record do more in-dept on how a person can separate from the Matrix safely without a red pill.    Program - Involves a trainee named Sis battling a test program called Duo in a training simulation and wins, but was distraught from killing him.    World Record - A man named Dan was competing in a track meet to set a world record for fastest time.  He succeeds, but accidentally unplugs himself in the process and needed rehabilitation in the real world before he can safely walk again.    Beyond - A teenage girl called Yoko looking for her pet cat Yuki in an old abandoned shack with a group of children and discover a glitch in the Matrix and can do anything like stop in midair before hitting the ground and fall slowly with item regeneration.  The Agents discover this, evacuate the group, and fix the glitch.    A Detective's Story - A down-on-the-dumps detective named Ash takes a case aboutfinding Trinity using plot-lines, quotes, and phrases from the Alice in Wonderland franchise.  After finding Trinity on a train, they are ambushed by Agents and Trinity had to shoot Ash on the shoulder to prevent him from transforming into an Agent. After parting ways, the possibly dying Ash stays behind to take them out.    Matriculated - A group of scientists on the outside world finding how to turn machines to their side by choice use a Matrix fun-house of various gags and teach them the value of human life like the T-800 from Terminator 2, and anyone who read my review knows my love for it and its predecessor.  After the sentinels attack the base and kill the rebels, the reprogrammed machine plugs the dying Alexa to say goodbye.    *Co-written by the film's writers and directors, the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry).    The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions (2003, 7.9 and 8.6 respectively)    The Matrix sequels involve the group trying to fend off a war between Zion and the machines that the Osiris crew warned them about before its destruction, but they realized that Neo accidentally transformed Agent Smith into a dangerous virus in his attempt to destroy him in the first film and is now able to copy himself at will by transforming innocent bystanders, especially the Oracle, and plots to destroy the Matrix and all of mankind.  After visiting the Architect and rescuing Trinity from her foreshadowed death, he fends off sentinels using his powers from the Matrix that lingered into the real world and slips into a coma that traps him in a train station between the Matrix and real world being held hostage by the Trainman, awaiting rescue from Morpheous and Trinity, and meets a married couple of programs with a daughter without a purpose while the Matrix begins to fall apart.  This is basically one screenplay split into two films and released six months apart on the same year, just like Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic and Knuckles nine years before.  Both sequels are like a mixed opinion kind of thing, some people loved them, some others hated them or one of the other.  I personally hardly heard people properly criticize the sequels without focusing their attention to occasional confusion in the story, which some excuse for stupidity.  I know the sequels are harder to understand than the original, but that doesn't make them suck, but to just need time to grow on you as you begin to understand it.  For some reason, some people I know favor Reloaded most of the time.  People might make fun of me about this, but I think Revolutions is underrated and better than Reloaded which I still accepted as a guilty pleasure and necessary sequel.  Yep, I said it!  One of the recurring themes of the series is about the choices we make and how they affect the future and, like the Angry Video Game Nerd said, should I pretend to be confused and go along with the crowd or voice my own honest opinion and point out details that others might have missed?    Whether you agree or disagree, here are points that some people prefer Reloaded:    -More emphasis on philosophy in the back-story of the series.    -The most action scenes in the series that are all over the place with the addition of a cool freeway chase.    -Character resurrection plot twist involving Trinity getting shot in mid-air and Neo saving her.    -An abundance of officially licensed songs in the credits.    However, here are the points on how I agree with PlanetHell on favoring Revolutions:    -Returning Agent Smith to his sinister roots after becoming a joke in Reloaded with the overuse of weak clones in battle, especially the Burly Brawl when Neo was able to hold off an entire swarm of them without a scratch, while the real Smith actually put effort into a fight.  This is because Neo and Smith would always have equal strength no matter what.    -A more prominent and crucial role with the Oracle instead of just a mere cameo in Reloaded with basic information on programs and choices we make in general that Seraph could have spread to speed up the pacing a bit, but I digress.    -No pointless filler unlike the overlong dance, the Oracle cameo, and subplots that occasionally go nowhere, thus faster paced and more right-to-the-point.    -Action scenes that are more focused, actually have a point to them, and not as over-the-top or excessive.    -The darkest score Don Davis ever composed, but that is not saying much, the scores of the franchise are fantastic.    -Recaptures the darker and more emotional tone of the first movie and doesn't cram as many questions so the characters can convey more emotion while Reloaded was more lighthearted and glossy as well as relies on a lot of exposition that can slow things down at times.    People would have expected the traditional cop-out ending of the main hero defeating the villain once and for all and they all live happily ever after.  Woop-de-doodle-do!  That is not what the Matrix series is about.  Like I said, it is primarily about the choices we make and how it affects the future.  After meeting the Deux ex Machina (Latin for God of the Machine) and connecting to the unstable Matrix and challenging Smith to a final showdown with all the clones standing aidely-by, as well as losing the will to live due to Trinity's actual death upon arrival to Machine City and in a last-ditch effort to put an end to Smith's reign of terror, Neo lets Smith transform him into another clone so that Deux ex Machina can bring the Smith code to the source and delete him, sacrificing Neo in the process and making peace with the human race after the big war.  The recasting of the Oracle of explaining the change in appearance due to a glitch in the Matrix during a rescue attempt is how you should do a proper transition instead of just leaving it at that.  After Gloria Foster fell ill before her scenes for Revolutions and Enter the Matrix were shot and died during production, Mary Alice took over the role of the Oracle and the explanation for the change in looks made the transition easy and unique, kind of like Exorcist 3.  By the way, is it just me, or does Alice give more helpful advice in terms of the sequels than Foster?  Revolutions also features the train station between two worlds concept from Spirited Away and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  In Reloaded when the beginning foreshadowed Trinity's possible death that nearly happened, showing the bit of her getting shot and falling on an oncoming car (ala Lethal Weapon, bipity-bopity-splat!) that early in the film made it feel a little bit predictable to me.  Removing the small bit of the Agent successfully shooting her and only the airborne shootout would have been more effective so that people can keep guessing what the outcome of that free-fall would be.  This is all my personal opinion.  If someone agrees or disagrees, that's okay.  I guess you can say, the Matrix really does have me.    Anyway, this is a great collection of the series to own in High Definition if you are a die-hard fan like me.  The picture and sound quality is amazing and the special features are great.  High Definition is the definitive way to watch these movies.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I had seen \\"Hachi, A dog's tale\\" through Netflix.  I so enjoyed it, I purchased a couple DVDs to give as gifts to other dog lovers.
B004B8DH98|5.0|This is an excellent movie. I knew George Clooney would do en excellent job because he is a great actor. The movie looks ans sounds great in blu-ray. There is beautiful women throughout the movie, gun fire and good action. Although I don't consider The American an action film but a drama about love, regret and someone that is good at his craft. In this case a person that kills human beings. I recomend this movie if you like a good drama and beautfully shot film. And well, how should I put this... prostitutes. LOL.
B00377V6J2|5.0|How great can two guitar players be?  Check this out the way they play off each other truly amazing.  I think Stevie made Mr King play better this night, they obviously had a great time together this night.
1582403589|5.0|I must admit that I had never even heard of the comic until after AMC adapted the story into an awesome television series that I pray doesn't get canceled.  I've always loved zombie flicks and watched them since I was a kid with my father and seeing how the story is always cut short due to the length of the film, I am really happy to have found this as a source to continue the idea of what happens next. And to know that Kirkman is still writing to this day makes this even more appealing, because if the tv show gets to join the realm of the deceased then we'll still have a pictorial reference to turn to.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|Whats to be said about this album is that its pinnacle in metal.<br />I first got into the priest during Unleashed In The East, listening to it off a old Radio station in Tacoma Washington 106 on my crappy radio, then getting into Hell Bent For Leather, then British Steel was an amazing work of Art.<br />The additional DVD is amazing in its suround sound brilliance.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|Johnny Depp has starred in some of the most controversial films made in the last 25 years.  Sweeney Todd is no exception, in fact, may be his most controversial performance yet.  Without ruining it for you, Sweeney Todd is a barber who commits some barbarous acts.  If you love Depp, get it, you'll probably love him in this.  If you don't have a cast iron stomach, this will likely gross you out a bit, more than any other Depp film that I can think of.  As always, his acting is sublime.  The production is very well done.  I see \\"dark comedy\\" as a tag and I think that it is, indeed, very very dark comedy.  I think that the film is for individuals.  There aren't many public outlets beyond libraries and schools of theater for which it is highly recommended.  I give everything a grade and this production I believe merits a grade of \\"B+\\".
B0000AMJEH|3.0|Click Click Boom! Does this story make me get excited and giddy, well the answer is nah the only film worse then this with Paul Walker is \\"In to the Deep\\" but that's another story. What really excites me about his film is that it's a sequel to one of my favorite films of all time. This movie is defintely cheesy and very very unbelievable. But hey I still enjoy it, it's refreshing seeing Paul Walker still young not like in the 4th movie and now 5th movie that's about to be released. Overall it's a fun cheesy film. Enjoy!
B002ZG981E|4.0|This movie was fantastic! The only reason I didn't give the Bluray 5 stars was because there was very little \\"making of\\" material on the disc, just a documentary about sleep and dreams
B00005R87Q|4.0|Great film from my youth I was like 11 when this film came out. Brings back old memories of simplier days. This film is cult classic that is a must watch, just like FIght Club. A rocking soundtrack, fun scenes, cool actors, etc. Great film, watch it and enjoy!
0740797719|5.0|As a Lighting Artist for Pixar I can truly say that this is the best book on color and light I have ever seen and highly recommend it to artists of all sorts who want to increase their skills.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was well written, had a fairly unpredictable plot, and truly enjoyable. Plus, it's very accurate and reflective of East Texas, the setting of the book.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|I saw this film when it came out in the theaters and thought the film had an uneven focus and somehow lacking. Therefore, when I found out about this \\"better\\" Director's Cut from Ridley Scott recently, I decided to give this version a try.    The movie was about 3 hours long and was indeed much richer than the so called \\"action adventure trailer\\" the theatrical was said to be of this full version. With the extra materials, motivations, backgrounds, and character developements were explored much deeper and gave the film the kind of unity it lacked in the theatrical version. Also, this version is much more graphic then the theatrical version from what I remember. Nevertheless, this film, while well made, can't compare to epics such as Gladiator or Braveheart.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|A stunning presentation by McNamara and the director of what he experienced and what he learned from his life and work. Must see.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Keef really brought the story of his youth and the band to life here.  I very much liked the writing although in sections it felt as if the interview transcripts had been used.  Sometimes the story/writing was a little choppy, but that is Richards' style, isn't it? Looking forward to Mick putting his own together.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|I have already written about this movie in one of the discussions here.  This movie seems to provoke some pretty heated discussions.  There are 18 five star reviews, being lead by one reviewer in particular. There are 29 one star reviews, some of which are difficult to make sense of.  I am sort of in the middle.  It is the kind of movie I like, but it has the kind of ending that I hate.  But it doesn't make any difference what I think.  It doesn't matter what anybody else here thinks, or any critic thinks.  In the abstract, there are good movies and bad movies, but it's just that we can never all agree what they are.  There are only movies that we either like or don't like.  Just never purchase a DVD of a movie that you have not already seen in a theater, or viewed as a rental.  You can only decide for yourself.
B002ZG97RE|2.0|I would like to see Matt Damon make an action movie that actually portrays our real enemies as our real enemies. Why does his action films (Bourne, etc) paint the CIA, FBI, Conservatives, and patriotic Americans as the enemies? The Iranians, North Koreans, Russian Rouges, Chinese Communists and other real enemies of America seem to be completely ignored in Damon's films. We, as Americans, are always the bad guys. Does anyone remember the news footage showing a caravan of more that 200 trucks leaving Iraq headed for Iran just before the US led invasion? I guess Matt Damon and Michael Moore believe those trucks contained flowers for Iranian people. A prominent democrat once inferred it was too bad Bush won the election because it robbed Al Gore of the opportunity to be the Commander In Chief of the Iraqui invansion forces. I wonder who would be the enemies of the WMD conspiracy if Gore had been elected.
B0043A0PXU|4.0|Despite some of the reviews, I took a chance on this CD, and I liked it.  If you like Annie Lenox's style, you should like her renditions of these Christmas songs.  Not your typical soft, sweet tunes, but then that's what I wanted -- something different.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I really liked watching this in the theater with my kids but I love watching it at home. The more I watch it, the more lovable and sweet Gru becomes.<br /><br />Steve Carell has done an amazing job of creating this lovable character through the accents, intonations and tone of Gru's voice. The humor is wonderful and the storyline develops nicely. The most touching scenes are when Gru reads about the three little kitties and then later on when he reads his own book. It brings tears to my eyes.<br /><br />The graphics are great and look wonderful on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />I don't need to rehash the plot because it is well described in the product description. But I will say that there are quite a few 'old gags' in here but with new twists. The minions are funny and are like having hundreds of stooges in one room.<br /><br />I like having this set because we can watch Blu-ray at home, DVDs on the road and a little mini-version on my iPod Classic.
0525423842|1.0|I was stuck. My iPad locked after and therefore no Kindle books to read.  I made the mistake of visiting a bricks and motar and picked up Theodore Boone for [...]!    Anyway, I have generally enjoyed Grisham so thought at least I would get some value from the investment as I passed the time on the beach. How wrong was I?  It took me about 2 hours to read,  Double spaced text quickly had me realising i had been ripped off. The pages turned quickly, not because it was gripping, but because there were hardly any words on each page.  I was trying to satisfy myself with the notion that there would be some twists and turns and surprises in the remaining pages, but once again I was left feeling ripped off.    This is with out doubt the last Grisham I will buy or indeed read.  The story was lame, it whimpered out before it got started and got even worse from there.  When I finished I figured Grisham had some last-book contractual agreement to meet and hammered out this rubbish to get a monkey off his back.  What else could explain the paucity of character, tension, plot, intrigue and words?  It is a slap in the face to the book reading public.  For those of you who do decide to read this excuse for a novel, ask yourself a few questions at the end.  What was the point of Omar Cheepe? What if anything did Ike bring to the story? Were you satisfied with the last page - it doesn't deserve to be called the ending because it certainly didn't conclude the story.      OK so I am an adult.  If this book was targeted for 12 year old kids there is nothing on the front, back, inside cover to suggest so. Once again I feel ..     Ripped Off!
B001USHRCK|5.0|Wow, this is a great LEGO set. We have [[ASIN:B003F7YHXQ LEGO® Kingdoms King's Castle 7946]] and many of the other Kingdom sets so this fits right in with the theme/era.<br /><br />This took quite awhile to put together since there is a bunch of mini pieces (vendor booths, carts, etc.) and two, two-story buildings.<br /><br />The buildings are hinged so that when they are open, they look like double storefronts (like the picture on the box) but when they are closed, they are two smaller buildings. There are plenty of details inside each building including a water wheel that turns a mallet inside the blacksmith shop. There is a bed, a \\"beer\\" keg, drinking glasses, a vanity with a brush and bottle, a table with a holiday meal of turkey, butter, and other miniatures, a horse stable with carrots, barrels with products for sale like fish. Additional details include flowers, a tree with flowers, oxen, three birds, a white horse and a treasure chest with gold money.<br /><br />There were some places that were difficult to get enough tension for the pieces to stay together. The tree is shaky and the roof on one of the buildings was difficult, not to build but to keep together.<br /><br />There are 8 mini figures from ladies to guards.<br /><br />Tons of details and fun to assemble. A worthwhile set to add to any LEGO Castle set.

B003Q6BQPS|5.0|This is a fun set to build and to play with. It will make a nice addition to many existing LEGO sets whether it is LEGO City or something else. It can also stand on its own.<br /><br />It comes with a two-story bakery with a large display window. The display window is outfitted with many bakery wares that can be lit using the battery powered light that attaches in the ceiling of the bakery. There is a bakery store with a display counter, cash register and money.<br /><br />Outside is a skating rink with two mini figs for skating. One comes ready with a camera for capturing the moment - like when another skater ends up feet in the air in a snowbank! The skating rink is outfitted with a bench for resting, lamp posts with a string of holiday lights (not actually lit).<br /><br />There is a booth for purchasing your Christmas tree with a mini fig vendor. The horse and wagon will deliver your tree directly to your home thanks to the mini fig driver.<br /><br />Lots of great details to see. Visit my customer images for more close-ups and detail!
0760335540|5.0|Great reference book for the boxster!  Bought my copy and I'm not even a current owner.  I had sold my '99 becuase of fears of IMS/RMS and cylinder issues.  This book does a great job explaining the myths of these engines and shows how to install updated parts as PM for the boxster.  Armed with a little more knowledge I would still be driving my boxster.  Pictures and instructions are clear and easy to follow.  I bought the book to keep on the shelf and always have as a reference.  Until its time to get it greasy that is.  I Highly recommend this book as well as the online support they offer at 101projects.

0312600844|4.0|It was almost painful to be in Patty's pov for so much of the book, but then Walter went from being winsome to a self-righteous idealogue.  Only Richard remained consistent, although a thoughtful, selfish predator with a heart.  But Franzen addresses the existential questions of privileged Americans like no other contemporary writer -- with real sympathetic feeling and seriousness.  For many people his issues are critical.  Most people would feel lucky to have such relationship issues, instead of finding their next meal.[[ASIN:B006KF64QS Islands in My Dreams]]
B001E9641K|5.0|Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries is another great addition to the Ticket to Ride series of games.  The best part of this edition is that it is only for 2-3 players, which can make for a more available game since it can be difficult to find up to 5 players for the other editions of Ticket to Ride.  This makes it much easier for my wife and I to enjoy a great board game without having to organize a \\"game night.\\"  Quality, as always with Days of Wonder games, is top notch.  The cards are similar to standard playing cards, and as such could wear over time, but it will take years and years.  Everything else is made of a hearty cardboard or plastic.<br /><br />Without delving too deep into the game play, there are several things worth mentioning.<br /><br />1. Locomotives (wild cards) may only be used on ferry or tunnel sections, and are treated like normal cards when drawing cards.<br /><br />2. Finding the routes from the tickets can be a bit difficult.  I haven't had much of an issue with this, but several people that I play with often voice confusion due to the cities being difficult to find.<br /><br />3. The 9 train car route is possibly unfair when scoring.  I have played 10-15 times within the past couple of weeks since I received the game, and the person completing the long route has won each game.  It makes for a race to see who can complete this section the fastest.  If you are unlucky enough to get a route that includes this 9 train section, you'd better hope you win the race, or you'll be forced to find another way around.  I don't know yet if this will continue to be the case, but it may warrant a \\"house rule\\" by changing the point total for the section from 27 to 18, or treating it like a 6 train car section.  I haven't made up my mind what to do about this, but it may possibly need to change at some point.<br /><br />Other than a couple of differences, this edition is basically Ticket to Ride: Europe with a different map and for less players.  Another great addition to this incredible game franchise, I still haven't met anyone that does not enjoy playing.  You'll find yourself immersed in no time!hise, I still haven't met anyone that does not enjoy playing.  You'll find yourself immersed in no time!
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|We love this game.  Kids are 11 & 8 & we had tons of fun playing as a family the other night--definitely a family night to look forward to.
0060734191|5.0|A friend recommended this series to me.  Her son had read it and she got hooked.  I read it and I got hooked.  I whipped through all 3 books checked out from the library and then ended up locating and purchasing the trilogy boxed set for myself for Christmas.  I can hardly wait to read them all again.  My friend Susie is 50, her son John is 24 and I am 61--a really good multi-generational read.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|I watched this with a group of people who all thought it was the best movie they had rented all year (2010).  i would recomend this movie!
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|great CD! my daughter loves it..  looked for it in the stores but not available.when they got it  in only 5 cd's at a time.. Amazon is dependable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0307588343|5.0|This is the first book I have read that spelled out in very understandable terms what exactly happened that brought our (and most of the Western world's) economy to the precipice. Not only was all the jargon spelled out, but the writer introduced me to his family, friends, coworkers and all those who were a part of one of the institutions that were behind the debacle. I wanted to meet the heroes who tried to warn folks and I am angry at those whose arrogance made them feel immune from sound economic principles. While I am an accountant and have something of a financial background, I could not understand what was happening in the middle of the 2000's in either the local real estate market- with ever escalating prices and all the mortgage offers in my mailbox- or with the stock prices of companies with price/earnings ratios I had never even heard of in my finance classes. I have read any number of books about the years between the early and mid 2000's as well as followed news about the financial meltdown at the end of the Bush years.I never before could grasp exactly what happened.  This is a must read for any and all folks trying to figure out how our country's economy got where it is today, but were not part of the system that brought us here.

B000WLIEKK|5.0|I bought Blackbird in 2007 and it is still in the disc changer in my truck. This is my favorite CD ever.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|It has been awhile since I've read this but even after finishing it I did'nt think wow. I though of a done! Lets go to the next book. I thought it was good but not amazonazing I liked the scences from France though and wanted to see more.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|My daughter was as engaged by movie as quickly at 3 as I was at 3!  What a wonderful classic that we can share!
0316172324|5.0|I talk about this book so much at work (I am in retail) that I had to buy a copy for others to read.  Very interesting if you like thinking about how people think or make decisions.
1416563156|5.0|My 6 year old son is a huge Indiana Jones fan. He loves to dress up and pretend he is Indiana Jones and he loves this journal. It looks like it could have belonged to Indie. I'm so glad I bought it. It was one of his favorite Christmas presents.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|While this story doesn't trigger a massive flow of emotion, it is one of Sparks' best.  The plot is well thought out and each character serves a specific purpose in the storyline.  The surprising ending is a real treat and is certainly worth the read.
B000PKG6TE|2.0|I've been in love with Queens of the Stone Age for some time now and this CD is absolutely WRETCHED. The ONLY good song is \\"3's and 7's\\". Period. NOT WORTH THE PURCHASE! Just buy that one track and forget the rest of this album.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I really appreciate the quality work that went into this production from the created sets,music,acting,directing and camera angles.  Steve Buscemi was outstanding in his performance along with many others in this fine cast.  Steve was right up there with my favorite gangster performances by Bruce Gordon as Frank Nitti in the Desilu television series \\"the Untouchables\\"  This series is a definite must for a bunch of Emmy Awards.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|If I were to tell you every reason WHY you should watch this season of Who... it wouldn't fit in this text box. This is BY FAR the best Season of Doctor Who EVER. Now that Russell T Davis is gone, the show can really pick back up and be the way it was meant to be.
B004EAQNO4|5.0|even though its a pg 13 movie some of the scenes are still violent. pg 13 is only blood, its got nothing to do with scares or suspense. i thoguht this movie was fantastic from beginning to end. its a small movie but it has a good bite to it. its almost liek a mini horror movie because of the short length. it movies slow enough to make the movie feel somewhat longer then it is which makes you feel liek you definately got your moneys worth.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|I'm a big fan of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp... and Danny Elfman. But this movie is incredibly terrible. Sure, Johnny Depp's interpretation of Willy Wonka is very interesting and unique... but this movie and its music is completely unmemorable and offputting.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|The Unrated Two-disk Special Edition of Saw contains an oil-filled packet (intended to resemble oozing blood) in the front cover of the DVD container.  I purchased a used copy which was shipped in this original packaging.  On arrival, some of the oil had leaked from the packet and made the DVDs unplayable.  I was able to wash and use the disks but I had to discard the fancy package.
0316098337|3.0|There were times I found it totally absorbing --- there were others where I thought the plot and language were totally unbelievable. Like a previous reviewer, I had a hard time walking the line between the narrator's little boy syntax and his very sophisticated vocabulary and mathematical skills. Also got a little \\"hung up\\" on the author's frequent use of British terms, particularly \\"bits.\\"    Still not sure if I liked it or loathed it.
B0031SU2Y2|4.0|I love indie fims and foreign films, and Film Movement is one of the best sources to catch those that are unlikely to make it to the big screen.<br /><br />\\"Welcome\\" (108 min.) is a French movie directed by Philippe Lioret and starring Vincent Lindon as a swim coach in Calais who befriends a 17 year old refugee from Iraq who is desparately trying to get to London to reunite with his Iraqi girl friend who already has moved their with her family. Since he is unable to get snuggled across the Channel in a truck, the boy eventually decides to train and then swin across the Channel. The movie makes excellent use of the Calais scenery including those tempting views on clear days of the English \\"white rocks\\" which look so close but yet are so far away.<br /><br />Vincent Lindon and Audrey Dana (as his divorcing wife with whom he remains on mostly good terms) bring good performances, but they are both outclassed by newcomer Firat Ayverdi as the 17 year old Iraqi boy. Last but not least, I thought the movie did an excellent job in setting the table of the multitude of immigration and asylum issues that plague so many West-European countries. Be aware, this movie is not for the faint of heart, and without giving anything away, don't count on your typical \\"Hollywood happy ending\\". This movie caught my attention from start to finish. Highly recommended!
0060853964|5.0|A hilarious book with absolutely no down-side. LOVE it! There's a  brilliant nature vs. nurture theme here, along with destiny vs. intent. Excellent in every way.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  I have watched it several times and still end up with tears in my eyes.  It is scary too which really got my attention.  The graphics are great and you soon forget you aren't watching real actors.  This will now become a holiday movie I watch every year with my family.
1932907009|5.0|I was a feature film executive who graduated from USC Cinema and thought I had a pretty strong grasp on traditional structure. And I did. But SAVE THE CAT is something special and new because Snyder's Beat Sheet (BS2) helps writers brainstorm specific sections of the screenplay independently.  And the concept of FUN AND GAMES from pages 30-55 is a revelation--if you haven't come up with some amazing Ideas of Value for this section in the outlining stages, there's no reason to jump into screenplay format yet!  There are hundreds of screenwriting books available but when dealing with new screenwriters, and most are useless or even counter productive. I've recommended this book to hundreds of aspiring screenwriters and they always thank me profusely for the recommendation!
0143038095|2.0|About a third of the way into the book I had to wiki up Amy Tan because the language content of the book made me strongly wonder about her upbringing. The language seems to be purposefully exotic-sounding, such as \\"The fifteenth day of the eighth moon\\". I'm sorry, but Chinese people do not speak like that. It's \\"Eighth month, fifteenth day\\". Mandarin is sprinkled in non-dialoge text to make it sound foreign, calling mahjong tiles \\"pai\\"s when tiles (or even cards) are perfectly suited and typically used by English-speaking Chinese. Or another example, \\"... Waverly Place Jong, my official name for important American documents. But my family called me Meimei\\", as though she felt like her name belonged to America instead of herself. Truthfully, this is a common happenstance in nearly every Chinese household, and is not limited to Anglicized names. Nicknames are extremely commonplace today in Chinese speaking countries and households, and one would hardly say their given Chinese names are for official Chinese documents, as though their named belonged to China and not themselves. These \\"family\\" nicknames are not used by persons outside of the family, and so one's proper name would be used, for example, in school and by friends. Thus, one would not really feel separated feeling form one's own name.         Things like that makes the book feel extremely disingenuous to someone who is a first-generation western-born Chinese and already has first hand an understanding of Chinese culture via western perspective. It reminds me of reviews I read for a Jewish New Testament (English Translation), where the reviewers accused the editors/translators of unnecessarily dropping in Yiddish in order to make the text sound more Jewish to appeal to non-Jews. From what seems like extra exerted effort to \\"Chineseify\\" the text, I (incorrectly) suspected Amy Tan was someone who was raised very western/white washed (perhaps 2nd or more generation) and was over-compensating using language.     It's not that the stories themselves are bad or disingenuous, in fact they reflect the culture so much it angers me (because it reminds me of my own upbringing) when I read it, but the language delivering the stories is trying too hard and distracting. I gave 2 stars because the distracting language makes it difficult for me (first gen Canadian Chinese) to enjoy. I think if you are personally further removed from the Chinese language and culture, you will actually enjoy it more, So consider it 3 or 4 stars if you are. Just don't think we necessarily actually speak that way.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|People are expecting 3-5 minute Daft Punk tracks! It's a movies film scored not a real cd. For them doing the Soundtrack to the movie it's a freaking awesome!! I enjoyed the movie a lot and Daft Punk's music made the movie even better! good soundtrack!!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I just rented this off of Amazon Video on Demand and I was very impressed by this movie.  The special effects and storyline are so complex and insanely good.  I loved this movie! I recommend it to anyone that likes a good action movie with an equally good storyline.
1401310400|5.0|I was a little worried when I ordered the book because the price was very cheap. But, I was NOT dissapointed in any way shape or form. This is an excellent book and arrived in perfect condition. The seller did have me a bit worried that the book wasn't coming becuase shipping seemed to be taking forever from the date it was shipped. But, I learned at a later date through email that this was due to the item being out of stock in their US warehouse. BUT, instead of just saying they couldn't fulfill my order and that it was backordered they went the extra mile and had it shipped from their UK warehouse. Any seller that goes above and beyond like that is good in my book. no pun intended. You will be very happy with this book as well as the seller if you decide to purchase from them!
B000Q7ZNEK|5.0|For 'Depeche Mode', Ultra brings out a completely new dimension of sound for this band. I have the basic 'Singles 85/98' & 'Very Best of... which are both great for an avid listener but with 'Ultra, Depeche Mode' blew me away. I heard there were troubles and changes going on within the band at this point. Most of the time, these are things that either make or break a band. For Martin Gore to step up and take control like he did. To reshape their sound with heavier guitar's and tighter tweaked out synth's from the other band members not only showed a much more mature and confident 'D/M' but also helped to keep them from possibly falling apart. Together they created an album with attitude. That's quite an achievement in times of do or die! Every song from 'Ultra' is too cool... so smooth and intriguing to listen to, deeper, stronger, opening new doors. Rather or not you've never even heard 'Depeche Mode', This is an album definitely wourth owning. No dought their best! A can't go wrong purchase...
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I've seen the movie now, and I went out and grabbed this soundtrack. I play the soundtrack over and over, and I can visualize the movie. It's an amazing piece of work.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|I'am a horror/suspense movie snob. I will watch 10 minutes of a movie, roll my eyes and turn it off. I didn't roll my eyes with the Devil. To keep it short and sweet, I felt it was scary, suspensful, and all around a great movie,  I wish I had seen it in the theatres.  I don't think you will be sorry if you buy/rent this film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was just plain amazing! I absolutely loved it and I read it completely in three days. It's a little confusing at first, but it is very simple and an easy read. Definately would recommend this to many people.
1439107955|5.0|Up until the last few chapters, this book was a compelling read and explained so much.  Also the thought processes of researchers - how they make seemingly logical assumptions, have some success then can't abandon their line of thinking even when the proof is there that they are not completely right.  How complicated this disease is and that there is no easy answer.  My only criticism is he did not seem to know how to end the book - it rambled on and on. Perhaps it would have been better in two volumes.  The history and then another later book on current research.
B0045XKJBI|1.0|I seriously don't understand how this movie grossed more than so many other movies....other than that Americans are completely idiotic and easily manipulated by marketing.  I have not seen such a horribly, illogical, and poorly acted movie that happens to get \\"rave reviews\\".....by Twilight fans of course.     Please, save yourself some money (I got it for free via a digital promo) and support a much better movie. There are millions out there
B000002UC5|4.0|That one song is worth the price of admission.  Still wears beautifully after 40 years.  Yes, the album isn'r \\"Double fantasy\\" but as someone else said if you are a Beatles fan or a Paul fan this has to be in your collection.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Super cute movie......bought for nieces for Christmas with all the Disney fairies dolls.  They loved them and the movie is super cute. Another great Disney product.
0312600844|1.0|This was an overrated, under-edited book by an author with plenty of talent and no discipline. The last 50 pages engaged me, but the previous 500 or so were rambling and not at all compelling. Because of all the raves, I stuck with it. But this is no masterpiece. I did enjoy The Corrections far more. The characters were flat and uninteresting. The sex was creepy.   Freedom was a marketing project, not a genuine literary effort. A long, sprawling Franzen book would sell no matter what, so why spend time and money editing it?  But, I appreciate that the book introduced me to the concept of cat bibs. If it's true that 1 million songbirds are killed everyday in the US by domestic cats, I agree that cats should be handicapped with these inexpensive bibs to keep them from killing more birds. Our cat kills mostly mice, voles, and squirrels. I'm hoping that a cat bib will impair her ability to kill these animals as well as birds. We've found the bibs online and plan to order one to try it out. Thank you, Jonathan Franzen, for that.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|There isn't much more to say about this chapter than what has already been said in the product description and reviews. I'm giving it 3 stars because it delivered exactly what we expect from a RE movie. Action, action, action but no real substance. It really seemed like this movie was one of those \\"We'll force you to make this movie or we won't let you make the other movie you want.\\" feeling. It felt like filler.<br />I don't normally write short, lack of information, reviews but there just isn't any more to say than what has already been said.<br />Needed to know before watching...Remember how in the last movie, Alice was now really powerfull and it looked like she would have an army of Alice's? The film makers decided, lets have everyone get drugged (yet again) and have their memories erased and this will explain why we are making yet another film. What??!! Wesker hits Alice with a serum to make her human again? But..He can still track her, she still survives a plane crash (just walks away)? When fighting, she still seems to have these abilities but they seemed dulled down. It was just something that bugged me about the plot from the start.<br />Buy it if you are a fan of Milla and the series but if you arent' a big fan, let it go. Rent it instead of buy it.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|I love that this album has so many dynamics to it. some of them are absolutely heartbreaking, and others are upbeat and poppy. I could listen to this amazing band all day
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Very good show.  I am looking forward to reviewing Season 6.  I really do not have time to catch the show on TV, so your DVDs are good.
1439133948|4.0|I love LMB,  and love this series,  but I couldn't really follow the crime here, and so  never quite understood the plot.  I had just reread Cordelia's honor,  and this may have just seemed too removed from Barrayar for me,  but while I knew the baddies were bad,  I still couldn't actually understand what evil they were planning on the other planet.  I liked Miles,  acting in his usual Milesish way,  and I liked seeing some old characters drop by.  I did like the boy Jin and menagerie and then the ending packs a huge wallop.
0120884674|5.0|This is a very good book! It's got lots of pictures (which are of very good quality), straight-to-the-point captions for images and a list of references that certainly won't leave you high and dry when you're in need of a deeper understanding of some topic. The texts are also very well written, but its most interesting feature is its portability: this book is easy to carry around, so it's perfect to be taken to the field, be it an archaeological site or a forensic lab.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|So after years of being out, I come back to this soundtrack. Every time it comes on in my iTunes or Pandora I always get excited for it. You can't really shake it out of your system.<br /><br />Five stars baby!<br /><br />(old review)<br /><br />When I saw the movie I thought that the Score sounded pretty amazing. However when I downloaded this album, I was disappointed. The songs are hard to differentiate from each other. Most of them start with a soft feel and then build up to the end. It just seemed like it lacked variety.<br /><br />I like Daft Punk but it doesn't seem like their creative juices were really flowing on this one. Sure the motif for the theme sounds really good, but that is all this album has going for it.
