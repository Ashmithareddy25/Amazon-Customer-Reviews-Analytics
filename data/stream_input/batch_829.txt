006135323X|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me and it turned out to be an absolutely great read.  The basic premise of this book is that people do not act rationally and certainly not as the rational agents that one assumes in classical economics.  Instead, we act in ways that would be considered \\"irrational\\" but are often quite consistent (hence the title).<br /><br />Mr. Ariely is a professor in Behavioral Economics in MIT so his case studies are tested through experiments conducted on various college campuses.  For example, one of his case studies examined the appeal of \\"FREE!\\".  In the experiment, they put up a concession stand selling chocolates - Hershey's Kisses at 1¢ and Lindt Truffles at 15¢ a piece (you could only buy one).  73% chose the Truffle over the Hershey's Kiss, even when they raised the prices a penny.  They then took the prices and dropped them a penny.  With the Hershey's Kiss as \\"FREE!\\", only 31% of the folks chose the Truffle. According to rational economics, this total reversal in behavior makes no rational sense (the price difference between Kiss and Truffle remained the same), and yet it does make \\"common sense\\".<br /><br />The book is filled with other such studies of \\"common sense\\" behavior tested empirically through different experiments.  He closes each chapter with takeaway concepts which could be applicable in more substantial situations (i.e. if you want people to get preventative health care, it would be much more effective to make it FREE! instead of \\"really cheap\\").<br /><br />Well written and very readable, it is well worth picking up -- not necessarily a classic tome that I must have on my bookshelf (I got my copy at the library) but is definitely worth the time to pick up and read.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It's a Dual Shock 3 controller.  It works and does what is supposed to.  Yay!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is so wonderfully romantic.  I am a huge P&P fan, but Richard Armitage knocked me right off my Darcy obsession...at least for awhile!!!  This is my favorite movie of all time.  Bar none.
B00168OINK|3.0|Just sat through this with my kids.  Great picture and sound - lame movie, for kids and adults.  Same predictable story line, seems like a half effort.  Jack Black bores the crap out me.  You never get the feeling this is anything more than celebrities voicing another underwhelming animation.  Save your time and see Toy Story, Cars, The Incredibles or Finding Nemo again.
B00004W5A6|1.0|Great album but I was disappointed in my purchase since this is really just a stereo version (albeit better quality) where I was expecting to have a surround sound (5.1) version of the album since it is SACD.<br /><br />I guess I'm spoiled by Genesis/Trick of the Tail and Floyd/Dark Side of the Moon.
0756404746|5.0|I bought this on a whim, and it what a wonderful whim it was.  This is one of the finest fantasy books I've read in years.  Rothfuss claims on his website to have displayed no talents as a child; that is only because storytelling in our culture has been dominated by television.  The man is a born storyteller, and it shines in the book.  I have to warn you though, that the book doesn't take off until 70-100 pages in.  After you finish the book, those initial pages make sense, but they don't exercise the magnetic pull the book eventually exerts on your attention.  Buy it and share.  I did, and will!
B00005JPO1|4.0|Very good for the last of the Indiana Jones series.  Harrison Ford does extremely well, as does Karen Allen, Kate Blanchett and Shia LeBeouf.  The plot is a little thin and could have been a little better, but there is a lot of action, which makes up for the lack of plot.  I own the other three and was happy to add this to my collection.  Anyone else who also has them won't be disappointed to have this one, too.

0374531269|5.0|This book is so interesting that it is hard to put down and if all of this is true that these boys went thru it; it's more amaizing that the human body and mind can go thru so much and survive with some sort of humanity.
0515141429|4.0|Even though I grumble when action movies or 'tough shows' like Law & Order lapse into what I consider to be soap opera (what artistes call 'character development'), I must confess that I LOVED learning more about Reacher's brother. He's a less huge, more thoughtful version of Reacher, a well dressed treasury agent. I don't think I'm giving away the plot to tell you that the murder victim early in the book is Reacher's brother.<br /><br />Maybe Lee Child will write another book that's a retrospective with more about Reacher's brother? I also liked the book with Reacher's mother and brother in it. Maybe I like character development?<br /><br />The plot is pretty interesting and once explained, I thought \\"aha!\\" which is good! The best plots are ones that are completely credible yet intriguing.

B0014DZ2VO|3.0|Knowing that Casino Royale was not going to be an easy act to follow from the outset, I really wanted to go against some of the critical reviews that weren't happy with this Bond outing and to find fault in their criticisms.  However, there was validity in what many found wanting in this effort.    Daniel Craig is a fine, believably tough, James Bond.  He is fit and conveys a convincing lethality.  Having seen him in so many other roles I know he has the ability to play it lighter and with wit.  This being a revenge drama, he logically isn't given that kind of material to work with here.  But I like him in the role, and I like the lean and mean and explosive violence he brings to it, and I will definitely go see the next one.    As to Quantum, it is a relentless action film and it would be difficult to find fault with the execution of the action sequences.  They are excellent and as believable as action in a Bond film can be.  And the continuation of the story from Casino Royale was understandable, albeit the resulting story becomes pretty thin and the perpetual action gives the film the eventual familiarity of an elaborate video game.    So we end up with a lot of great action, carried out by a fine cast (I like Dench's \\"M\\"), that in the end is exhausting and left me unsatisfied.  It felt like what it was, the continuation of Casino Royale, fleshed out with lots of action and locale changes, but is not really a stand-alone film, and can only, we hope, be setting the table for better storylines in future films.  So, we wait and hope.  The table is nicely set, now let's see what they do with it.

B00005JMYI|5.0|Anchorman is a film that only comes around once every decade or so and it sets the standard for any comedies to follow. Arguably being Will Ferrells best it's a film with very ridiculous comedy moments brought together in an extremely intelligent way. It's not something where the jokes are reeled off one by one in an in obvious way, in fact some of the more funny jokes you can miss the first time round as they're very subtle. Along with Will Ferrell this film has a very strong supporting cast with people like Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and Christina Applegate. They give us a great blend of serious acting with very, very silly humour. I'm not usually a fan of the silly comedy movies and I'm sure a lot of people will shy away from it because it looks just that, however, it's something that will surpass all expectations and then some.<br /><br />Anchorman tells the story of 1970s San Diego news Anchor Ron Burgundy and his time as the most respected Anchorman in the San Diego area. Him and his team, Brian Fantana (Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) & Champ Kind (David Koechner) are brought into peril when an aspiring woman Anchor is brought into the team. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is brought into the news office due to complaints of lack of diversity. This woman is strong and no matter how hard the main news team will try, she's not going to be put off from her goal to be Anchorwoman. Ron manages to use his charm and his ability to play the Jazz Flute (No Inuendo intended) to win over Veronica and they end up dating. She wants to keep it quiet because it will peril her career, but Ron being a mans man tells San Diego live on air that they're sleeping together. Through another series of unfortunate events Ron Burgundys dog baxter is killed leading to him being late for newscast. Seizing her chance, Veronica takes charge and becomes Anchorwoman for the one show to the dismay of Ron. Because she was so successful she is promoted to co-anchor and the relationship is off.<br /><br />I'm tempted to tell you the entire story but I wont. It is awesome though and is one of the most bizarre, childish and intelligent comedies I've ever seen. People would try to knock this film slightly by saying it's not as funny as his prior film, Old School but it's definitely much much funnier. The over the top acting of Ferrell is worth it alone as I could watch him in his outrageous emotional state after Baxter was killed, all day. Steve Carell is also another shining light in the film as he plays the dumb weather guy who's the over the top idiot that comes out with hysterically stupid things. \\"I stabbed a guy in the heart\\" the way he said it has to be witnessed as it's just classic Carell.<br /><br />One of my favourite lines from the movie which occurred in the opening credits as it was just so unexpected and very very silly. \\"The human torch was denied a bank loan\\" is an absolute classic which I think many people will agree with. Also the fight between the different channels news teams is also a classic as it features cameos from one of the greatest comic actors in Ben Stiller as the Spanish language news Anchor. I could honestly go on and on about how crazily funny this film is but I would give everything away. All I can say to wrap this up is you will need to watch it more than once in order to catch all the jokes as some you will miss the first time around.off.

B001F0VHEM|1.0|Although my intelligence is vastly superior to the usual targeted bubblegum audience of this music, I gave Funhouse by Pink a chance, only because I was selected to review this album.  I took it to my hostel, listened to it all, wrote notes, then listened to it again.  I did this for 2 hours, then tossed the CD in the trash.<br /><br />All I can say that it was a horrible experience.<br /><br />Unfortunately Pink has denigrated music to the point that anything produced by inarticulate, mumbling singers qualifies as harmonic music.  This is not something one can listen to at all.
B0000042GM|5.0|An excellent set that I've gotten much listening pleasure from, and will certainly continue to do so. Definitely 5 stars!!

1416511946|5.0|I bought this book for my husband who is a big Motley Crue fan and he could not put the book down.  I decided to buy it for him because it was very hard to get it from the local library.  He read the book in a week!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Liam Neeson is one of those actors that although you will admire their work, Taken is a movie you could never expect them to be the lead in. It's a full blown action movie that challenges the 56 year old and his acting ability to appear cool. The film has its drawbacks, but they are all massively outweighed by the better parts of the film.<br /><br />The film focuses around retired spy Bryan Mills (Neeson) whos daughter is kidnapped whilst on a trip to Paris with her close friend. He's a man who wasn't there for a lot of his daughters life due to his job, but is trying to make up for lost time with overprotective, suffocating fathering. Kim (Maggie Grace) and her friend are kidnapped by Albanian human traffickers whilst Bryan is on the phone to Kim. He tells her not to be scared and he will find her, he also tells the Albanian kidnapper who taunts Bryan on the phone. This leads into a series of events where Bryan is investigating the human traffickers in France using vigilante methods, but this is at the displeasure of the French authorities and an old friend of Bryans who simply want him out of France. He promises his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janseen, who quite frankly creeps me out) that he will return her safe and sound, at any cost but the only drawback is he has 96 hours.<br /><br />This is a really good and fast paced action movies that has some excellent chase and combat scenes. Neeson seems to hold his own well and can display some excellent ability when it comes to those action scenes (although I'm sure a stunt double was cleverly placed in those scenes). Some of the dialogue is quite cringe worthy especially when Neesons character is on the phone to the kidnapper and he tells him that he has experience and he will be coming for them. It's something very clich&eacute; and annoying in some respects but quite cool in another. The other gripe I had about it was the accent of Neeson. I'm not sure where his character was meant to hail from but it certainly wasn't American born and bred, or at least I hope not. Neeson's a good actor but he really needs to work on his American accent because it just destroys any role he's in when he's meant to be an American but his Irish accent clearly shines through.<br /><br />It's a great film overall though and I would strongly recommend it to any action movie fan. He's good in this role, but I can't see him doing another role like this ever again as although he held his own, he seemed at times to be quite uncomfortable in what he was doing. The supporting cast are OK but nothing to shout about, the story is well done and seems to be quite intelligent in what it's talking about when on the subject of human trafficking. But what do I know, maybe this is the most inconsistent movie I've ever seen. If it is then it certainly hid it well. I just have one request to any future movie makers, please don't cast Famke Janseen, she's just weird., or at least I hope not.

B000002UAR|5.0|Classic Beatles. The album that started it all - their own sound, that is. Not one of the cheezy reissue comps...  Shipper was accurate and prompt.
B001FSDOZO|1.0|Dark Horse by Nickelback is the type of \\"noise\\" that you just can't seem to get used to. There's always some type of metal head who is going to listen to this rubbish. A cross between mall metal and limpid rock, it's not appetizing at all. Transparent vocals, grindingly tedious guitar work and a dull country music ethic.<br /><br />Not my style at all.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|i have waited since he won american idol for this cd and it was worth the wait.the song permanent had me in tears.and i sing along with light on and time of my life.i highly recommend this cd
B001DHXT20|5.0|Product arrived in good condition and sooner than I had anticipated.  However, that was because I hadn't paid close attention to the shipping information-- I thought it would show up a day later.    I received very good service.
0634022296|5.0|this book is really good if you play along with the chords. the only thing is it doesnt have all the little licks they play, just the chords.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|This is the first Trivium album that I consider worthy of five stars.  As so many others have rightly noted, it is a blend of Ascendancy and The Crusade.  Now, when I heard \\"Kirisute Gomen\\" for the first time, I thought \\"Oh no, they took five steps backward and returned to the Ascendancy-type vocals\\" and I braced for the worst as I headed into the rest of the CD.  I'm happy to say, however, that Shogun as a whole leans a lot more toward The Crusade, at least in my opinion.  Fortunately, the frequency of the generic metalcore screaming has been kept in check on this one, and the cheesy/juvenile lyrics that were sprinkled throughout The Crusade are pretty much gone.  There's no change of direction musically, which is obviously a good thing, and there are plenty of Crusade-like melodic hooks that more than make up for the screamed vocals that are present in every song.  With this album, Trivium has now blown past Shadows Fall as my favorite American metal band.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I ordered Seinfeld Season 9 from Amazon to complete my collection. The dvd's came in the time specified and in perfect condition. I couldn't ask for anything more. Oh yeah....it was cheaper than getting it anywhere else. I checked. I've ordered a number of items from Amazon over the years and have never had a problem. I recommend them to anyone!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Perfect for the ones who have followed the seasons, but a little racy for the kids.  Loved every minute of it.

B001FSDOZO|3.0|I'm a huge Nickleback fan and was so excited to hear that they're back with a new album. I pre-ordered the album and couldn't wait to listen to it. Then the disappointment came Nickleback is such an awesome band but they went wayyyy to mainstream and that's a huge disappointment for me. I mean the album is good but it's completely different.....I miss the old Nickleback the Nickleback before \\"All the Right Reasons\\". Hopefully they will come back soon....
0439023483|4.0|The Hunger Games is an awesome book! I read it in one sitting. It had me hooked after the first few lines. I totally agree with the reader who's review read \\"another reader said The book is entirely compelling, then instead of an ending, it has \\"End of Book One.\\" $%&#! I wanted to read a whole story, not the first episode of another franchise,\\" I agree totally and wish writers would stop with trying to get on the money train and just write one book with a greqat ending.  I am sick of series after series that ruin the greatest of the first book installment, which I feel is what happened with the Twilight books. I hope Ms. Collins can repeat her brilliance in the next installment but I am doubtful. I hope she proves me wrong.
0740748475|5.0|Think about it for a moment with me.  I already own every Calvin and Hobbes book that has been published, so I own every one of the strips, some of them in multiples.  So why would I, and many others, slap down nearly $100 for something we already own? Granted, given the weight of this collection, it's still cheaper, per pound then pretty much anything you'll find in the grocery store.<br />Is it perhaps that we felt gypped out of truck loads of Calvin and Hobbes merchendise?  Maybe if Bill Waterson had caved in on his \\"No Merch\\" policy we wouldn't feel the need to buy this.  A couple of coffee mugs and a t-shirt and we would have stayed happy with our paperback copies.<br />Well no that's not it.  The fact is this hefty collection just seems the perfect way to preserve the Calvin and Hobbes legecy.  For most of us who followed the strip through it's decade long run, it took on a deeply cherished place in our lives usually reserved for more formal forms of literature.  This is because Waterson didn't just master the art form, he transcended it.  With the simple tale of a boy and his tiger, he dug deeply into childhood, adulthood, and life in all it's forms, both pleasant and not so much.  He hit all the notes. He didn't just make us laugh; he made us cry, think, and warmed our hearts with something as simple as a watercolor of Calvin and Hobbes walking in the snow.<br />And so yes, I spent my hundred dollars to re-buy a bunch of comic strips that I already own.  And I, like most of the fans out there, was very pleased to do so.
1400063515|4.0|Enjoyed Black Swan.  It was an easy read and addressed some interesting high concepts around probability theory.  The math toward the end of the book likely sent a few things over my head, but I didn't feel anything was purposefully pedantic.  As for the main premise, I am not quite sure that today is more extremistan than yesterday -  notwithstanding current dysfunction in the capital markets.  I do think our expectations for normalcy have been heightened given our current propensity for risk (or lack thereof).  So stuff feels much more extreme.
0486409511|5.0|I am so excited to have this book!  It is a beautiful book.  The first section sketches a brief history of Copperplate, the second teaches how to make the letters (with both correct examples and incorrect examples and plenty of explanations).  The last section provides a few guidelines and ideas for how to work out your layouts and projects to get you started.  This book seems to be an excelent book on the fundamentals of copperplate.  As I said before, it is a beautiful book, and I can hardly wait until I finish my pressing projects to start workin on my Copperplate.
0375714839|5.0|Persepolis, originally published in two volumes, is an autobiographical graphic novel by Iranian expatriate Marjane Satrapi. It chronicles her childhood in Iran during the Islamic Revolution, her coming of age in Austria, her return to Iran and her second departure, to France, after her failed marriage.<br /><br />Satrapi's black and white art is thick-lined, simple and spare, and it fits the book well. The vignettes of everyday life she presents are fascinating, because of Western unfamiliarity and because of her tremendous openness and honesty.<br /><br />Ultimately, Persepolis is an engaging, many-layered work that gives an honest, revealing view of a way of life that most Westerners are extremely unfamiliar with.
B001DHXT20|5.0|Edward Norton is a great hulk, He has the geek thing down pat and He really looks like a man running away from something in this movie.
B00129H7VS|5.0|First off, the Blu-ray edition of this mini-series is visually stunning!  I also own the standard DVD version and there is a great difference.  In addition the DTS-HD Master audio track is excellent and brings out every sound imaginable.  Now to the series itself.  It is, in my opinion, the best mini-series ever produced for television.  Everything from the production to the acting and the writing is top notch.  I have seen Band of Brothers a minimum of 10 times and it never gets old.  It shows the sacrifices that those men made for their country and the world in a real way.  It can be exciting and moving at the same time.  From the first episode, 'Currahee', to the last 'Points', it is a captivating view.  Everyone will be moved by every episode.  In particular, the episode 'Why We Fight' shows not only the horror of the Nazis, but the compassion of our American soldiers.  The 2 episodes regarding the Battle of the Bulge would be one of the best WWII movies ever had these simply been release in that format.  Throughout the series, we see the best of the men who save the world.  We also see the faults and humanity of these same men.  This series should be required viewing in all high schools so every person can see what these men did to, in my opinion, save the world.  There are many standout performances throughout the series.  Ron Livingston (Nixon) and Damian Lewis (Winters) gave outstanding, though controlled performances.  Donnie Wahlberg's portrayal of Sgt. Lipton stands out among an excellent supporting cast.  Do yourself a favor and watch all the extras.  These give you a unique insight into the actual men on which the series is based.  This set is worth every penny and is my absolute favorite of every DVD/Blu-ray that I own.  You won't be disappointed by Band of Brothers.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The best movie that covers a lot of the eastern way. I was born there.  My grandparents where seperatet from us between east and west. I visitet every year from the time I was 8 years old to 14 years old. I had various exeriances crossing the border and livering in the comunist country 6 weeks every year. There be lots more canvas for other movies.  Exellent viewing and exellent as far as facts go.
B001GQO50I|4.0|If your a fan of the doors,you'll like this release.It's from a early time in there career, before they made it big, March 67. The music is good and you'll hear the doors like you never heard them before. There's a big stink about this release because it was not sourced from the master tapes,which are owned by peter abrams blah blah and blah.Like I said, if your a fan of the doors you will like this release.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Heath ledger is phenomenal in his performance as the joker! Christopher Nolan has re created the Batman franchise into something batman fans can be proud of.

1899618740|1.0|Not at all what I expected. Would NOT have purchase had I realized it was 3 inches by 4!  You also have to cut out the 'film' from the first page and then hold over the pages to follow. Too much $.  I am stuck with two...maybe a stocking stuffer.
0786838655|5.0|A young man thinks his biggest problems in life are his ADHD and dyslexia, maybe a bully or two, but then he discovers that he's half god.<br /><br />This very clever book (written primarily for middle school to early highschool students, but rewarding and enjoyable for adults, too) imagines that the Greek gods are still around and still up to their old ways-especially going out and having children with mortals. The writing is very witty; the author had me laughing out loud more than once. The plot is great and never slows down.<br /><br />Readers are rewarded for knowledge of Greek mythology by having an idea of where the author is going with his story. You can read the beginning of a description and know right away which monster or god it is. Keep in mind, this is a book written for young adults, so don't get too happy when you figure out the Oracle's prediction way before the other characters do. Also, seeing as this is a book about the gods' influence on Earth, don't be suprised by the large amount of deus ex machina in the plot.<br /><br />My one and only complaint is that I felt the chapter headings contained too many spoilers.

B000JU7NCE|5.0|A great overview of one of the pioneering and most unique rock band to grace the scene with their best songs. I've recently attended their Concert here in Singapore and I'd a great time and I'm still mesmerizing with the songs they performed.     This is a great Concert captured on DVD and they constantly captivate the audience with spectacular lighting and again a great rock band!    I strongly recommend for those who just want to seat back after hard day at work and enjoy the great performances by The Cure!

B001L4NJIO|5.0|WOW..  this is one of the great trios of all time..  I'd have to put them above Hendrix because his partners weren't on the same level..and a notch above Cream who also sported 3 insanely wonderful musicians. These guys are a few decades past their founding and biggest hits and they absolutely bring it..both on performance and energy!    This is an amazing  set list of dead bang classic tunes and a beautiful DVD from all aspects..well  worth my investment (at BEST BUY they have  the exclusive) and like  the other reviewer said...the bonus documentary is pretty good  as well.  you also  get the concert on two CDs!    All  in all  a great package showcasing  what was the biggest and  baddest reunion tour in some  time.  I'd put these three  up against any current  band and  certainly over weak corporate shlock like The Eagles.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Best action movie in a while.  This beats out any superhero movie made in the last 20 years.  P.S. Watch after the credits.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Overall, this is a great film.  It's fresh, well-written, surprising, and just the sort of \\"small film\\" that is so difficult to get right.  Most films that take this sort of honest evaluation of typical middle-class life in the contemporary United States end up being unwatchabley pretentious or stridently political.  Juno is neither.  Rather than continue to sing its praises - which has been well done in earlier reviews - I wanted to note a couple of flaws that kept this from being a five-star film for me.  First, while I love Ellen Page and her performance makes the film, she seemed too old for the part.  Looking up her bio, she is currently 21, which would have made her about 19 when Juno was filmed.  The character is supposed to be 16, which is a crucial plot point.  A key to the film is that Juno is precocious and very young - not just a high schooler, but a young high schooler.  In watching the film, I didn't buy for a minute that Ellen Page was 16; if anything I thought she was in her early 20s, or older than she actually was.  I'm sure the producers tried to find someone the correct age and were willing to tradeoff Page's brilliant performance for her being too old, but, unfortunately, this lessened the impact of the film for me.      Second, [SPOILER ALERT] I thought the only real false note in the film was the ending.  I can certainly buy the idea that Juno is willing to give up the baby to the Jennifer Garner character because Juno believes that character will be a good mother to the child, despite her divorce.  But it just seems very unlikely to me that someone as sensitive and self-aware as Juno is would be so blasé about the decision - unwilling to even look at the baby in the nursery before Jennifer Garner takes him away.  This seemed particularly implausible after the film has brought Juno and her boyfriend back together and shown that she has hopes of a long-time relationship with him.  In those circumstances, not to even discuss keeping the baby?Seems unlikely.      Overall, though, this film is a must see and worthy of the acclaim it has received.

Unfortunately we have to wait for the next one till Jan and they have not made many of these books he has all of them and read them all very quickly. It keeps his attention from cover to cover and doesn't put it down till he read the whole book.  He absolutely loved the do it yourself book he had a ball filling in all his details. I would definitely recommend this book.
0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals will probably endure as one of my all time favorite books.  As an educator I have witnessed first hand the benefits of collaboration.  Effective leadership depends upon identifying and utilizing the strengths, talents, and abilities of every team member.  It involves an absence of ego and a strong sense of purpose aimed at the collective good.  An environment of acceptance and respect is also an essential element of creative problem solving.  As per Doris Kearns-Goodwin Lincoln was the quintessential collaborator steering a course through the most divisive time in America's history accompanied by a diverse team of extraordinary statesmen.  How right she is.  Her book is a masterpiece and a joy to read.

B000YAA68W|4.0|Movies don't come much more boldly original or stylistically unique than the animated hit \\"Persepolis,\\" an autobiographical tale of life under a totalitarian regime as seen through the eyes of a spirited Iranian girl named Marjane Satrapi, who, after immigrating to France, wrote the graphic novel upon which the film (co-directed by Satrapi herself) is based.  Satrapi was a wide-eyed, inquisitive youngster when, in 1978, the Shah of Iran was toppled and a new era of freedom appeared to be dawning for that nation's people.  Unfortunately, as is so often the case with revolutions, the new regime - in this case, the fundamentalist Islamic Republic led by the Ayatollah Khomeini- turned out to be even more cruel, dictatorial and repressive than the one that got overthrown.<br /><br />As the central character in the movie, Marjane is both an observer of and a participant in the many events that play out in the story, as any number of her own relatives and neighbors fall victim to the systematic purging of all those who refuse to adhere to the present regime`s newly enacted draconian measures (women must go out in burkas and head scarves, lovers are not allowed to hold hands in public, etc.) - while those who remain behind live in constant fear that they will find themselves in jail or up in front of a firing squad for a simple, perhaps even inadvertent, code violation.  Yet, despite all the bleakness and repression, hope and freedom of thought somehow miraculously flourish and prevail in the human heart, as exemplified by Marjane who refuses to yield her rebellious spirit (she buys bootleg Iron Maiden CDs from hawkers on the street) to the forces that would suppress and imprison it.<br /><br />In terms of style, \\"Persepolis\\" relies on old-school cell drawings rather than computer graphics for its animation.  The starkness of the times and of the setting is enhanced by the simple, \\"flat\\" look of the largely black-and-white drawings.  Yet, the movie is a veritable cornucopia of visual delights, thanks to the animators' generous use of surrealism and magical realism throughout the picture.  (If the movie reminds us of any one film, it is probably \\"Yellow Submarine\\").<br /><br />In quick, bold strokes, director Satrapi, along with her co-director Vincent Paronnaud and their team of expert animators, chronicles not only her own experience but that of an entire nation as well.ights, thanks to the animators' generous use of surrealism and magical realism throughout the picture.

037571457X|5.0|This book provides an interesting look at a relatively dark and largely misunderstood period of time.  Told from an interesting point-of-view - that of a child - and in a unique way - as a graphic novel, this book brings new insight to this time in history.    As the story begins, the young girls are being forced to wear head coverings, yet the young ones do not understand why.  As the story progresses, the reader begins to understand the vast difference between what is portrayed in popular media and what actually occurs.  The reader also begins to understand that the thoughts and beliefs of the people are not always reflected in their government.  The book tells the story of the rebellion of the Iranian people against their government.  What makes it more interesting is that the book is told from the perspective of the child of revolutionaries.  We see her parents participate in protests, her parents' friends arrested and tortured, the vast class differences that exist in that culture and their real implications on the people who live in that society, and finally, we watch as her parents send her away to receive a better education and \\"better life\\" in France.      The other aspect of this book that makes it so intriguing is that it is a graphic novel.  The drawings are all black and white two dimensional drawings with short dialogue, much like you would find in a comic book only without the color.  These drawings actually help the author treat the violence very clinically.  The drawings evoke a lot of emotion and convey a lot of information and feelings without any of the gore or graphic images.    This book would be well suited for a history classroom, especially side-by-side with a true historical text or textbook.  Using this book this way helps provide students with multiple perspectives on a series of historical events.  It could also be used as a primary source, because the woman writing this book is doing so from her first-hand account of the events.    A word of caution...this book should be used with high school students or older.  Younger students may not be mature enough to fully understand the content.
B001E75QGG|5.0|The movie itself was not that good, but Amazon.com was.  Just curious.

Only good reviews get published here?
B0014DZ2VO|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Those anticipating a smart, savvy follow-up to the superb, revivifying \\"Casino Royale\\" from 2006 will be sorely disappointed by \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" an instantly forgettable entry in the ever-popular James Bond series.<br /><br />A muddled, barely coherent storyline - featuring a hitherto unknown group's involvement with some sort of badly explained eco-terrorism - is no match for the overwrought and overproduced nature of the film, in which Daniel Craig's 007 goes from being a complex, conflicted character in \\"Royale\\" to a soulless killing machine here.<br /><br />The action sequences are hectic as all-get-out, but with no one at the center of them for us to really care about or root for, they quickly loss their luster and impact.<br /><br />Here's hoping for better things from the franchise next time out.
B001DHXT20|5.0|This movie is everything the first movie should and could have been.  Great action and Edward Norton does an exceptional job as Bruce Banner.    This film is much closer to the comic book and it shows.  It's FUN!
0670020745|4.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously.  I saw the author, Jill Bole Taylor, interviewed on Oprah prior to ordering the book, and was intrigued by her story.  There were a lot of technical references and maybe a little too indepth description of how the neurons connct with each other, etc......, however the life changing information I took from this book, (understanding the effects of positive/negative energy on the patient, knowing I can personally control my thought processes without going through a brain trauma, and the correct approach to someone who has had trauma to their brain)is something I will use for life.  It's definitely a good read for anyone but especially someone who has a dependent relative and/or close friend.  I believe the book speaks for those who are either temporarily or permanently unable to speak for themselves.
1416562605|4.0|Although I personally would 3-star this book, I realize that's due to my subjective tastes as a reader as well as my dislike for the protagonist -- poor reasons to lower the rating of a book.  Rather, I am 4-starring it out of admitted admiration for the writing.  It's clean, fluid, and insightful.  Author Aravind Adiga embeds admirable figurative language throughout.  And it makes a political statement about the class society of India -- one that is bigger than India, in fact, and would apply to many countries in this have-and-have-not world.<br /><br />So, take stock of yourself as a reader.  I liked it less because the driver/protagonist, Balram Halwai, who lives under the boot of his master, Mr. Ashok, is a bit of a psychopath.  In fact, I felt shades of Dostoevsky's CRIME AND PUNISHMENT (only without the \\"Punishment\\") the whole time I was reading this book.  It's a keenly psychological novel where you must adapt to the first-person point of view of a murderer (however justified) who takes you in his confidence through the course of seven days.  Pepper the stew with a bit of unreliable narrator and you realize what you're up against.<br /><br />There's no denying this work is unusual, however.  Unusual and well done.  So if you like Dostoevsky's stuff, love to be in the head of intelligent madmen (Poe, anyone?), and don't mind a little violent crime mixed in with gallows humor, grab the tail of the WHITE TIGER and enjoy the ride.  Although it wasn't to my reading tastes, in fairness I must give it its due.
0517543052|5.0|The first time I read this book back in the 70's I wrote to a friend of mine saying, \\"My mind...my mind is blown.\\"  Thirty years later my mind is still blown by Ram Dass. He was at the forefront of a cultural revolution which allowed milllions to find a more spiritually rewarding way to live. What was once a New Age way of looking at the world is now firmly imbeded in our culture.  In my memoir, Hitchhiking from Vietnam: Seeking the Ox[[ASIN:0978909305 Hitchhiking From Vietnam]] I use what I learned from Ram Dass to help me straighten out my life after returning from Vietnam. Be Here Now is a delightful hodge podge of stuff that will help the novice spiritual seeker sort through the voluminous literature of self actualization in a very accessible way.  Like Ram Dass would say, \\"It's all just stuff,\\" but what mind blowing stuff it is.  I highly recommend this book.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|First came Iron Man. We all knew that would be great based on the many trailers and all the news and hype surrounding it. But Marvel wasn't saying anything about The Incredible Hulk and we didn't get any trailers until just before it came out, so understandably people were worried. Especially after Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003. But thankfully Marvel proved to those that were doubtful that they needn't be and they are now 2 for 2 when they have complete control over their movies. Incredible Hulk was everything Ang Lee's movie should have been. Not only did the movie pay respects to the comics but to the TV series as well. Norton was great as Bruce Banner and was much improved over Eric Bana. The Hulk also looked notably better than he did in Ang Lee's film, a little less cartoonish and tougher like we'd imagine him. The story was much better in this one and there were many references to S.H.I.E.L.D., Stark Industries, Iron Man, Captain America, and the Avengers. Also there were small parts for the soon to be Doc Sampson and The Leader which should set up Incredible Hulk 2 nicely. There are many bonus features including cool deleted scenes and an alternate opening which was cool and as you all know has the faint image of Captain America's body in the ice. It looks amazing on blu-ray and is a must have for superhero fans or fans or Edward Norton.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I don't usually listen to music like this (Metal is my poison of choice), but after hearing a song or two from this band on my girlfriend's iPod I was convinced that I had to investigate this band further.     What appeals most to me about this band is that the music is FUN. You can tell these guys are just jamming out and if a song hits #1, great, and if not, oh well.     Alot of the guitar and piano (?) parts sound really simple, yet they're amazingly catchy.     I love the twangy guitars in \\"A-Punk\\", \\"Mansard Roof\\", \\"Campus\\" and \\"Bryn\\". But above all I love the piano in \\"Walcott\\", which is by far my favorite song.     (Note to self: \\"I Stand Corrected\\" would make a great forgiveness song)    Kudos to the band too for rhyming lyrics. Call me a traditionalist, but I love rhyming lyrics, whether they make sense or not.     The vocals are also worth mentioning. Like I say, I listen to alot of Metal and it's nice for once to hear someone sing in such a way that I can hear every single word without having to refer to the lyrics booklet included with the CD.     Speaking of the lyrics booklet, all the lyrics are there and in a nice large print. Your squinting grandmother would approve.     Are all the songs worth listening to? No. There were a few that I didn't bother inducting into my picky music library, but on the whole, this is a very good CD, hence the 4 star rating.
0670020745|5.0|I found this book to definitely be insightful. I have a close friend that had a stroke at the age of 35 and this really helped me understand what she was going though at the time and now after two years of healing.  Also, I found many tools for myself to reflect on regarding inner peace.  A worthwhile read..
B001EOQWEO|4.0|For a movie with a message about consumer culture, the dvd comes with a ridiculous amount of packaging.

B00005JPO1|3.0|This Indiana Jones had lots of action, and it had a good plot until the ending.  It did not have the same affect on me as the original 3 films, but Harrison Ford was a whole lot younger then.  The romance was kind of like an old man making it with much younger women and his age showed in several shots.  He is not quite as caviler as he had been, and did not have that sane old pizzazz, but that might have been in the screen play.  For the most part the performance was good though and the movie was worth adding to my collection.  I felt the worst part was the ending, talk about corny, this even tops AIs ending in that category.  So I give it a 3 out of 5.

140120306X|1.0|I usually don't write these reviews much, but I had to have my say.  I felt bamboozled after reading this graphic novel.  The first two had a sense of adventure, imagination and took the reader on a unusual journey that was just plain fun along the way, at least for myself.  After reading the Black Dossier I felt that the writers and artists threw this together in a couple of days to receive a hefty paycheck.  No imagination or fun, it was like watching a \\"made for tv\\" movie.  This will probably be my last Alan Moore graphic novel;  if the rest of his career he throws up this \\"dreck\\" I will wait for more of his stories to be made into movies, at least then I may have only wasted 4 dollars at the video store instead of almost [...] bucks.
B001F290E4|5.0|I heard \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" played on the R&B station I listen to and was surprised the artist was Seal.  I thought he did a great job on the Sam Cooke classic.  I then listened to his rendition of Curtis Mayfield & The Impressions \\"People Get Ready.\\"  At that point, I knew I was going to buy this CD regardless of the low ratings viewers have given this album.  Obviously, Seal fans are used to his \\"rock\\" style and aren't ready for such a soulful, classic, melodic CD.  The brotha really goes deep into the roots of African-American R&B of the earlier groups, puts his own spin on them, but his delivery is superb.  So, old school baby-boomers and post-boomers will really appreciate this CD so aptly named \\"Soul.\\"  Soul it is, and definitely R&B!  I listened to every track and never took it out of my CD player while I ran errands for about four hours.  Frankly, I was sad when Track 12 played because I knew I had to listen to the CD again.  Beautiful CD!  Old Schoolers -- you'll love it it if you like the ballads of Wilson Pickett, Al Green, Sam (the Impressions), and of course, the wonderful balladeer Sam Cooke.  \\"I Can't Stand the Rain\\" is sung like a man (as opposed to Tina Turner) would sing the song, and I didn't have a problem with his rendition.  I love this CD, and I've never bought a Seal CD in my life!  Also, you'll remember Luther Vandross covered a lot of songs and took home lots of Grammy's.  So, if you can cover a great song but add your own flavor, what's wrong with that?  Beautiful music remains beautiful if the artist can sing!

B0019T9FL6|5.0|Prior to buying this CD, I loved \\"Spotlight\\", but after reading the reviews, I was a little apprehensive.  Trust me, the negative reviews must be coming from rival artists because this debut CD is fantastic.  There is no reason to skip a track -- it has music for all genres.  I was forced to listen to Rap when my son was growing up, thus developed an appreciation of that style of music, but T-Pain and Ludacris are mainly providing background vocals, Jennifer definitely takes the lead.<br /><br />This is a great CD, and I'm definitely an R&B fan.

B001GQACGO|1.0|I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS EXCITED ABOUT AN ALBUM RELEASE IN YEARS. I NEVER TRY TO COMPARE ALBUMS BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE BORING IF THEY WERE THE SAME BUT IF YOU HAD A MAGIC RECIPE THEN IT MIGHT BE WISE TO SOMEWHAT STICK TO THAT RECIPE. I HAVE LISTENED TO IT 3 TIMES AND IT'S HONESTLY DREADFUL. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SONG EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE MINUS SINGLE LADIES LIKE FREAKUM DRESS, GET ME BODIED, OR GREEN LIGHT. THE SONGS THAT SHE SAYS ARE SUPPOSE TO BE R&B SOUND LIKE YOUR TYPICAL BRITNEY SPEARS OR RHIANNA POP TRASH AND I WAS SHOCKED. NO HOOKS, NO MELODIES, NO UNIQUE SOUNDS. NO FUNK. THIS IS COMPLETELY A COMMERCIAL SELLOUT. THERE A MILLION BALLADS ON THIS ALBUM AND EVERY SINGLE ONE SOUNDS THE SAME.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|Wall*E was never just a kid's movie. It's got your requisite cute, starring characters and supporting cast, but it's more than that. Much more. This is one of PIXAR's best and brightest stories and visual accomplishments.<br /><br />The story starts with what seems like a simple little robot working to clean up the mess left on Earth. Grabbing garbage, pulling it inside, compacting it into a small cube then stacking it neatly. As the day moves on, you can see this has been going on for a long time. Piles higher than skyscrapers line the streets, each with neatly stacked cubes of trash.<br /><br />Wall*E is really the only thing you see moving around doing anything; his companion is a happy little roach, cheerfully watching and following Wall*E around. Every so often Wall*E finds something and puts it to the side. When he goes home to his storage trailer, he does things that any of us would do: taking off his 'shoes', turning on the lights and turning on his 'TV', a video iPod with magnifying screen.<br /><br />Soon, you can see why he's left alone: all the others units have stopped working. You can get a real sense that Wall*E is the only thing left. And all he wants is someone to be with, just like in the movie he watches and listens to while working, someone to hold hands with. A really cute and endearing theme that stays through the movie.<br /><br />Soon, the arrival of EVE, a slick, hovering robot with a mission arrives. Wall*E soon is fascinated by EVE and they eventually begin to find each other as friends. When Wall*E gives EVE a present he'd found earlier, it triggers her main directive and original reason to be on Earth. When EVE is forced to leave, Wall*E has to follow her.<br /><br />EVE goes home to the star liner that left Earth long ago. There you see where everyone from Earth went; to a simple life filled with automated everything. This is where the supporting characters find their way into Wall*E and EVE's path, a bunch of misfits and malfunctioning robots, all trying to help EVE and Wall*E fulfill her directive. Here, you also get the first real look at what life without any kind work has done to the human population.<br /><br />EVE's directive pushes the story along to find the main antagonist who's kept the humans on the star liner and plans to keep them there no matter what. From here, the race is on to show both EVE and Wall*E's humanity. EVE wants to do what her directive tells her to, but doesn't want to hurt Wall*E. Wall*E just wants to be with EVE and help her any way he can.<br /><br />The whole time I watched this movie, I'm rooting for Wall*E to just keep working his way along, getting a simple pleasure of out watching him do what he does: collect things, spending time with his pet and even dance. Then when EVE shows up, it's like watching the awkward boy try and meet the popular girl. You want them to be together because he deserves it, it's all he wants anymore and helping her makes him happy.<br /><br />I'll also admit I choked up a few times when some events happened. The characters had hooked me pretty hard. I didn't want bad things to happen to Wall*E; I didn't like it when they did. The way the story is made, you feel for Wall*E. They did well in getting the characters just right so that you can and should connect with them earlier and often.<br /><br />Once you start to really look at Wall*E and the rest of the robotic crew, I stopped thinking of them as animated cartoons and as real as any regular movie. The animators were so detailed many times I couldn't think of what I was watching as anything but real. For example, there's many shots of Wall*E's three fingered hands. Taking a close look you can see the weathered, scraped, dinged and scratched fingers of someone who's put in a lot of hard work. Then you look at EVE's smooth, almost silky white fingers and you could almost reach out and touch them both.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend this movie for anyone for anytime they want an excellent story with great characters.<br /><br />Of the added extras, the best one was the PIXAR short: Presto. Simple and short and full of comedy. It's the story of a magician with two real magic hats. The first is the top hat, the second is a magician's conical hat. The magician has one assistant, Alec, a hungry bunny. All he wants is his carrot. Without the carrot, he uses the hat combo to keep the magician from simply pulling a rabbit from his hat. The entire time, Alec uses everything around to humiliate (in true comic form) the magician while on stage to the roars of laughter from the crowd.one was the PIXAR short: Presto.

HER VOCALS HAVE CHANGED BUT SHE IS AN IMMENSE SINGER WHO KNOWS HOW TO MAKE POWERFUL HOOKS AND MELODIES. SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID SHE HAS CHEESY BALLADS AND I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IF YOU LISTEN TO THE LYRICS, THEY ARE POWERFUL AND WELL PRODUCED. MY FAVORITES ARE FUNHOUSE AND BAD INFLUENCE.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is awesome!  The board and pieces are beautiful and the game itself is challenging, yet not too complicated.  There is just enough complication to keep you coming back.  You will need to play with the rulebook open for the first two times or so, but once you know the rules, it's a cinch.<br /><br />I like the way it mimics real life; people who invest early in their infrastructure/business/education end up earning more at each \\"cast of the dice.\\"<br /><br />My husband and I play it without the \\"Robber,\\" because it seems to take it from \\"I want to win\\" to \\"I want you to lose.\\"  We still have whoever has more than 7 cards put half back, and whoever rolled the 7 still takes the card of their choice, but no placing the robber on anyone's square.
B000063V8S|5.0|This was a seamless purchase. It came as promised, quickly and without a hitch. The product itself is in top condition and I am very pleased!
B001GQACGO|4.0|At first I was a little skeptical of Bey's direction for this album, as it was something new for her.  I listened to snippets, and picked a few songs that I thought might appeal to me.  I opted for the deluxe version because it had more songs that I enjoyed.  The cd has been on constant rotation since I received it!  I love the I Am...tracks over Sasha Fierce. Her vocals have improved and I Am...displays them nicely!     I think some were expecting the same old Beyonce, and were disappointed because they didn't receive that.  This album shows growth.  There are still fun songs on the Sasha side, but I Am...is about love.  My fave tracks are IIAWB, Halo, Disappear, Broken-Hearted Girl, and Ave Maria(simply beautiful).  Single Ladies(makes me want to dance), Sweet Dreams, Hello, and Scared of Lonely are my fave tracks from Sasha Fierce.  Overall I think the album is a turn in the right direction for Mrs. Bey!
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|I'm not sure when plot became a focal point in determining the worth of any of the films in the James Bond franchise but, apparently there are those who've decided to take issue with the (perceived) lack thereof in \\"Quantum of Solace\\", the latest entry in the series.  Whether the plot is complex to the point of being indecipherable, or non-existent--I've heard both--it's a good idea to have seen this film's immediate predecessor, \\"Casino Royale\\", in order to grasp the very basic mechanics of the story.  Picking up where \\"Casino Royale\\" left off, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" finds Bond brooding over the lost and lamented Vesper Lynd, his one true love (??!!), as he seeks to avenge her death while dealing with dastardly baddies attempting to mine water from the Bolivian desert.  Okay, so the central conceit of corraling water for one global conglomerate isn't that enthralling.  Who cares?  There's more than enough action, colorful locales, and non-stop excitement to make up for it.      Daniel Craig is, perhaps, the most interesting Bond since Sean Connery, and his rugged good looks are suggestive of the late Steve McQueen.  To their credit, the scriptwriters of both the newer \\"Casino Royale\\" and \\"Quantum of Solace\\" have reinvented Bond as a tough, quick-thinking, manly man with depth and emotion, eliminating the witless bon mots and dry sarcasm that epitomized prior incarnations and almost sank the series.  Craig's Bond is a spy for this millenium, morally ambiguous with an edge, and one who eschews the outmoded cocktail banter and uber-cool suavity of his predecessors.  You can dress this Bond up and send him to the opera but there's always the coiled animal roiling just below the surface; he's a Bond who actually has a soul.      Olga Kurylenko, as femme fatale Camille, is both beautiful and worthy of the Bond Girl title.  Tall and dark, she's a tough and resourceful cookie, who gives equal time to rescuing and being rescued.  Mathieu Amalric, while not a world-class villain, is still suitably slimy and possesses the requisite evil sensibilities to make us root for his demise.  The great Giancarlo Giannini is pretty much wasted in what amounts to an extended cameo, as he reprises his role of Mathis, the agent who discovers, too late, that he should have stayed at his Italian villa with his statuesque beauty queen.  Also reprising a role is Dame Judi Dench as M, Bond's boss and mentor, who can't quite decide what she wants to do with her wild-card, 007.  And in a scene lifted directly from \\"Goldfinger\\", lovely Gemma Arterton, a temporary Bond bed-mate, finds herself coated and drowned in oil and laid out on Bond's bed (in \\"Goldfinger\\", Shirley Eaton was coated and smothered in gold paint and laid out on Bond's bed).     Despite occasional lapses in logic and the self-referential pilfering of the Connery/Bond films, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is still a fine addition to the series, as good as \\"Casino Royale\\", and infinitely better than many others.
B000UJCALI|4.0|This of course is an older movie but still one of Nicholsons best.This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.
B000006NPY|5.0|Adore is one of the greatest albums ever recorded in the history of music, and probably the most misunderstood. There is a reason why it sold poorly and why so many fans dislike it, but it has nothing to do with the quality of songwriting. Songs such as \\"Behold! The Night Mare\\", \\"Blank Page\\", \\"Crestfallen\\", \\"Daphne Descends\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time\\" are the most melodically gorgeous songs Billy Corgan has ever written, and make the songwriting on Siamese Dream seem amateurish by comparison. The real reason why this album is disliked is simply because it doesn't sound like The Smashing Pumpkins. The people who will appreciate this album are people who are most likely to never hear it.<br /><br />The sound and tone of Adore are so different from their other releases it could have been done by a different band. The Pumpkins always had a distinctly American sound, but aside from songs such as \\"Ava Adore\\" and \\"Perfect\\", which sound out of place on this album, that sound is absent here. If the late artist Edward Gorey (who was also from Chicago) made music, it might sound something like Adore. This is dark, ethereal beauty (I don't want to use the word \\"Gothic\\" because most people have a strange view of what constitutes goth nowadays).<br /><br />In conclusion, it is unfair to call this album \\"garbage\\", but if you are a Smashing Pumpkins fan it's definitely reasonable to assume that you will not like this album.
B000E41MS6|5.0|My brother who was on holiday over from Britain ordered the second seires for me last year.He also ordered the third and fourth ones this year so it got me into getting the first one my self .I am happy to be able to get them from Amazon as they dont sell them here in the shops in Canada,and the delivery time is great.  As for information on the product I think Dr. Who fans all know they are getting the best with way more than just the episodes ,there is video diarys and special segments on the making of the series which is great behind the scenes stuff,a must for all fans and Si.Fi. fans any where.Any older fans like myself dont have to worry about it not being the same as they have kept it in the same kind of format but with use of new tecnologyfor special efects.Once you see one episode you will fall in love with the series all over again,Happy viewing.  From Helen in Canada
0312427646|4.0|The Uncommon Reader is a lighthearted and winsome little novella, a pleasant break from the heavier tomes of capital 'L' Literature, but no less smart for it. In his fictional scenario, Alan Bennett follows what might happen if Queen Elizabeth II went to fetch her corgis out of a traveling library and, to be polite, checked out a book. And then found that she actually quite enjoyed reading. And then began to take less pleasure in her queenly duties because of this newfound hobby. The novella shows an internal development spurred by reading and compellingly notes that one who reads begins to see others in a more empathetic way. While part of the fun of this novella is playing with the idea of the Queen as a fictional character, book fans will also enjoy The Uncommon Reader's many allusions to other texts.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|This is a Disney movie that is a must have, and if you can't wait until 2010 when it's re-released(including on Blu-Ray), then it is worth the money.
B001DU8T6S|2.0|Paul Rogers doesn't cut it!  Freddie was the King, the King is dead, may he rest in Peace.  There is a reason why it has been so long since Queen released any material with Paul Rogers, he SUCKS.  His work in earlier bands was pretty good.  He is so out-classed it is actually sad hearing him try to fill the huge void Freddie left behind.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I really enjoyed the music while watching the movie and couldn't wait to get the CD.  If you enjoyed the movie, this cd will pleasantly surprise you.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|This album is typical Keane, you get what you expect but it's full of fun, singalong tracks that can put you in a good mood.  Really enjoyable.
1577316517|5.0|....of going through the book myself to extract the key concepts to better reflect upon! I highly recommend it; the presentation is of a photo stand mini altar; it is very beautiful and easy to use; totally worth the price.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I can't believe how GOOD this movie is.  Really I can't.<br /><br />The color graphics are UNREAL.<br /><br />Though the content is mature I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.  ESPECIALLY for the artistically inclined.<br /><br />GO SIN CITY!!!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I LOVE this movie! I can't believe I've gone my whole adult life and never heard of the series of books from which it was born. I know it was intended as a kid's movie, but I found it to be entertaining and delightful myself. (Of course, that may speak more to my child-like imagination than to the movie itself.) However, if you enjoyed the Harry Potter series as an adult, this movie is for you as well. Go for it - let your inner brat out for a bit and splurge!
B000G03Q2S|5.0|Another release of the excellent Pet Sounds album by the Beach Boys.    Although released previously in boxset form and as a DVD-A disc,this release combines the best of them in one stand alone set.One disc with the entire album in both mono and stereo,the second disc has the entire album in 5.1 surround sound and HI-RES 96kHz/24 bit PCM stereo as well as video footage from 1966,a 1997 edited making of and an edit of an interview with Brian Wilson from 2003.The packaging is great ,the front cover is embossed with the albums name and the booklet inside contains the lyrics of the songs on the album,technical notes on its  recording back in 1966 and its digital remastering,the stereo remix and some photographs as well as the albums standing in modern music then and today.   This is a superb introduction to Pet Sounds at a good price for anyone with an interest in good music.
0792839749|5.0|I had not seen this movie in well over 30 years but remembered loving it as a small child. I recently bought it for my 4 yr old son. He absolutely loves it and asks for it repeatedly. I find all of the content acceptable and age appropriate for him.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|No more megabuck copieson Ebay now since it's nowe reissued in a brand new 2 DVD set from Criterion!!! Yes,very shocking movie,much more than most horror films!!! NOT FOR THE KIDDIES OR PEOPLE w/ WEAK STOMACHS!!! The transfer of the film is superb,and the extras are first rate!!!
B00000ING2|5.0|This is the hidden gem of the Coens' ouevre - arguably on a par with Lebowski. Tight, witty, darkly humorous dialogue and outstanding performances by Tim Robbins, Paul Newman, and especially Jennifer Jason Leigh - with smaller, yet essential, roles by Charles Durning and Bruce Campbell. Even a peek of Steve Buscemi. Great score, fabulous art direction, and writing credits shared by the Coens and Sam Raimi. Buy it, and watch repeatedly.
1932100660|5.0|Reading this book could save your life.  It is not light reading but it you want the truth about the best diet possible read this.  Knowledge is power.
B000000OQF|5.0|This will always be known as one of the greatest rock albums of all time!
0393316041|4.0|Before readnig this book I knew very little about Physics and never even heard about Richard P. Feynman. After reading the book, I got a greater appreciation for Physicists and what they do.    Feynmans witty attitude keeps the reader awake and yearning for more. He describes physics with such simplicity that a child could understand. His great attitude and vivid imagination help you conceptualize his experiments both as a child and as an adult. Great book overall!
B001DTPZNY|3.0|I really liked most of the Indiana Jones movies and even caught some of the Young Indiana Jones on tv now and then.  I really wanted to like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull also, but the movie is just missing the fun spark from the past ones.  The writing for Shia's character just is not good, he's given a stiff language to try to act with, he has much greater range then he's given the opportunity to display by the writing/script...actually almost all the characters are boxed in by the lack of good writing.    I didn't think the premise for the ending was all that bad or outrageous especially considering the \\"pulp\\", mystery powers, adventure seeker background the original movies Speilberg and Lucas tried to capture originally.  The movie could've been so much better, but at least it's good enough where they may be able to renew the series -- though without Harrison Ford who did look just too old and tired at times in the movie.  Overall the movie isn't as good as Raiders and is more akin to Temple of Doom but falling short in quality compared to that one also.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|they could open up a Western Union. I watched this thing on a plane and even with the crappy audio, I could always figure out what was coming next. From the initially disaffected kid to the purdy icelandic \\"guide\\", the screenplay writers didn't so much write a script as they did a bunch of set-up and payoff lines with really lame jokes. And they even provided a rollercoaster ride a' la the Indy Jones movie. And if one carnival ride is worth doing, its worth over-doing with two more.     Still, it provided an hour and a half of mindless entertainment which was successful at passing the time. Its probably fun for the young kids without being too scary but if you have other things to do, you're better of doing them instead of watching this.
0375826726|1.0|Slow paced and boring.  Not anywhere near the level of either of the first two books.  In fact, if it this had been the first book of the series, I know I would never have finished it or started the series.    I know that he must set up the fourth (and hopefully final) book with some new characters and anticipated plot twists, but this book gives us very little of anything else.  Even the small amount of foreshadowing is lost in the hundreds of pages of drivel that is written.    I think that when the last book comes out, we will find that it could have stood alone with the first two as a complete trilogy, eliminating the need for \\"Brisingr\\" altogether.
B001C08RHA|5.0|These Marvel comic movies just keep getting better. A must watch, and for a comic fans, especially, a must buy.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|This series is great! I've watched many shows about Rome(a notable one being I, Claudias) but this is my favorite. I like that it's told from the point of view of the common soldier. Vorenus and Pullo seem as though thay really existed.    The show was shot in Rome and used Roman extras, and this added a sense of realism to it. If you are bothered by full frontal nudity, you may not like it, as there is a lot of sex.    I do confess I have a crush on Kevin McKidd who plays Vorenus. And his character is a man of great honor and a firm believer in standing by his friends. The actor is now a regular on Grey's Anatomy if, like me, you get attached to him.    I highly recommend this DVD. You won't regret buying it.
1594200106|1.0|Dear Lord The Shadow of the Wind is a stinker.<br /><br />I had bad feelings about it even before I started reading it...just looking at those absurdly gushing reviews on the back book cover from various newspapers in Germany, I had a premonition that the readers were blowing smoke.<br /><br />If this yawningly stupid and overwritten book had not been given to me as a birthday present, I wouldn't have even bothered opening it up. But, to be fair to my friend, I decided to give it a try. Okay, I've given it a try and now I say, Phooey. I've read a little over half of this nightmare and have no intention of finishing it. I don't care about any of the characters, what their problems are or what happens to any of them. Good riddance.<br /><br />Amazon, you need a rotten tomato or a stinky-looking fish to click on for those of us who really dislike something and want to warn the public.<br /><br />And now there's going to be prequel? Yikes.
0920668372|5.0|This book tells the story of the 'circle of love'.  It really touches your heart when you read how the mother took care of her little boy and when she became frail, the grown up son took care of her.  Wonderful gift to give a new parent.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|I tried this album on a recommendation from Amazon based on other purchases and it is a winner. This band reminds me of a cross between  Crosby,Stills + Nash, The Grateful Dead and very early Genesis (which is not to say Fleet Foxes don't have an original sound - they do - I am just reminded of those other bands). An excellent album.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my best friend, so I have not personally seen it. However, he has raved about it.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Movies like Iron Man restore even the most bitter critic's faith in Hollywood. This movie is the way films should be - entertaining, yet though-provoking; exciting yet educational; realistic, yet futuristic; and more importantly, well acted, well directed, and well written. Its main characters self-prophecies to have flaws, but this movie hardly has any. With superb special effects, amazing gadgets, and stunning visual effects - this movie was meant to be seen in Blu-Ray.
1400063515|5.0|An excellent read during this time of troubled economics.  A challenge to those who rely completely on statistical significance in all aspects of life.  Thought provoking.

B000NVDMT2|5.0|The first read was on the way to Sturgis for the rally. It was about a man and his son on a bike ride across the top of the states. The second read was about how reality is only now and then it is the past. This third read is bordering on insanity and how , pretty much, none of this is real. We tame time and space to fit our needs and what we can handle in our perception of time and space. Man, everything (all molecular structure) is moving! Color doesn't exist. Time and space are constantly shifting. I'm getting \\"it\\" and must choose to continue to go along with mankind's charade or go totally insane. What a damn choice! I feel like I'm copping out. There are guides to this book, and I might get them next time. I'm flying without a net for now. Great book.
0743270754|5.0|This well written book will be a joy to read for history buffs. Lincoln knew how to choose an effective cabinet and at the same time essentially eliminated political rivals by incorporating them into his cabinet. Lincoln kept his friends close but his enemies closer. Often you felt that the President was being overly cautious or hesitant, then discovered his reasoning to be so much more clearer and accurate than given credit for. Our country has been blessed with great leaders, but none greater than Abraham Lincoln.The author does a wonderful job of leading you through the story and through the thought processes of the President.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|If you've heard claims of overproduction on David Cook's self-titled album and have your doubts, look no further than the album artwork. What makeup artists and airbrushers did to David's face, the production team did to his music. So, if you like the typical AI fare for the masses, this album is for you; if you were hoping for the risk-taking material that set David apart on AI, don't expect much here.     Much ado is being made over David \\"writing or co-writing 10 of 12 tracks,\\" but it doesn't really matter much who wrote what, as most of the tracks sound pretty much the same once they've been through the AI production wringer. After all, even Chris Cornell's co-penned song gets easy-listening treatment.     Despite these annoyances, David's voice does sound good, and the music is harmless enough. I have no problem having to listen to it for years to come while I sit in doctors' waiting rooms or shop in the local mall. But I think David has more substantial music to offer. I also think he has the potential to escape the Chris Daughtry comparisons and the perceptions of artistic credibility that haunt the AI crowd. This album is not going to help him get there, unfortunately.
B00005OM4K|5.0|Geat Music if you are a CCR Fan and if you aren't, You will be by the time you finish listening. CCR had a Very distint sound and some great music came out of that sound.<br /><br />Other reviewers have done a much better job of reviewing this CD set, So there's no need to repeat what's already been said. It's a Great collection that can't be beat.
B00005JKG9|5.0|It's just a great movie with lots of star power.  Who couldn't love Al Pacino as Roma, Alec Baldwin as the sales \\"motivator\\" & Jack Lemmon as the has-been?  Ed Harris as the wanna-be, Kevin Spacey as the Sales Manager & Alan Arkin as the simple guy just trying to make a buck also do wonderful jobs here.  If you are in sales or more likely, if you are a sales wanna-be, you'll love this movie.  If you're looking for something to make you feel content find a cartoon movie with some woodland animals in it.  You won't find any warm fuzzies here, but you will find wonderful examples of playwriting & acting.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I recently watched this movie, and I have mixed feeling about it.  While it is true that historical accuracy is stretched and the dialogue isn't exactly period, I enjoyed the performance given by the actors chosen for the role, and much of the movie on its own account.  However, the movie generally is choppy, not unlike a Reader's Digest version of something longer...I am left with the notion that this DVD is actually meant for Prime Time Television, edited for time allotted between commercials, and so left me feeling cheated. I wonder if Justin Chadwick (the Director) just lost interest in the project.  SO, not a movie to buy, but not too bad a rental for a rainy day.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This album pulls you in from the very beginning and keeps you wanting more. David is in wonderful voice. I highly recommend it to everyone. Wonderful job! 5*****
B00168GYFK|5.0|I got this first edition because I wanted to have a hardcover of this book.  This man is just awesome.  He writes so well.  I learned so much about how government runs by reading it.  I would say, if you are thinking about reading this book, do it.  You won't regret a moment spent.
B001EO2UKO|3.0|Being a fan of Dido and all her previous work.  It's hard to not compare this album to her previous two releases.  But this one is very different from past efforts and normally it isn't a bad thing.  But I had a harder time really getting into particular songs on the cd with the exception of \\"Don't Believe In Love\\" which I really had a great time listening and the video is different from the norm as well for the song.<br /><br />But really apart from that and maybe \\"Grafton Street\\" and a couple other songs.  It left me more than a little disappointed, not in the overall effort of the record.  It just felt like I song was running right into the next as there was no change of pace or anything for even one song.  It would've made the trip home a bit smoother.  As it stands right now though the ride left me wanting (some, even a little bit) of her past efforts to show on this one.  I'm not going to stop being a fan or anything like that but with this amount of time between records and the end result.  It might leave some folks a little bit sour.<br /><br />Me...I still love her voice and style as much did the first time i heard \\"Hunter\\" off her first cd.  If you choose to buy do like one of the other reviewers said and listen to a few songs first.  Maybe on Itunes or another music site to preview before buying.
1416562605|4.0|After reading the reviews and noting that this slight volume had won the prestigious Booker Prize, I ordered a  used copy from an Amazon seller.  The book, in excellent condition, arrived quickly and I dove in.  This scathing and yet hilarious satire on India's political, social and cultural systems had me roaring, for instance when I visualized the main character driving a cab through horrific traffic while pouring drinks over the back seat for his passengers.  A must read.
B001GQACGO|5.0|I absolutely love this Deluxe Edition!!!...I think that it's original and both cd's offer a different side of Beyonce' that we don't often get to see...Simply put...Job Well Done!!!

B001BJ690Y|5.0|YES!!! If you like this movie, BUY IT!  The picture and audio quality are SUPERB.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Love this soundtrack! I start my day getting ready for work by listening to \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\"--how can you not be pumped up after that!  All the other songs are great, too, and of course there's \\"Bella's Lullaby\\", so beautiful, but at only 2 minutes, not quite as long as I would like.
0345479092|3.0|I found this book to have a great deal of helpful information.  It did give us a better understanding of infant sleeping habits and personalities.
B000063V8S|5.0|As a Trekie, it feels good to own my own DVDs of the series and no longer watch my VCR tapes from the time I originally watched the shows.
0312427999|5.0|This is a remarkable book.  Although I understood a lot of the things that Klein talks about in her book, I had never put it all together into a whole before.  I feel like I understand what the battle lines really mean now, much better than before.  Far better, she explains why these things have been obscured--e.g., why we haven't understood the necessary relationship of the conservative theories of Milton Friedman and the brutal policies of torture in those countries that have put those theories into effect.  We have treated the totalitarian policies of torture as a humanitarian issue and economic theories as a choice between two competing economic theories.  This book is a tour de force in bringing together historical facts in various places (Chile, Argentina, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Iraq, England, and now the U.S.) with the economic wars that are being fought on many levels throughout the world.  Despite its sometimes repetitive nature (it could have been edited into at least 2/3 of its present size), I think this is the most important book I've read in the last two years.  I think/thought that Kevin Phillips, AMERICAN THEOCRACY, was an extremely important book a few years ago--this is even more significant, and I recommend it without qualification.
0060899220|5.0|I had such a fun time reading this book! I think the afterword was lame...make no apologies Bourdain!
1582701709|4.0|I think the book is okay for those looking for positive reinforcement, but i dont think you have to read it to know \\"the secret\\" ie the fact that whatever you reflect will be attracted to you, so goes for positive and negative thinking as well. The trick is, how to stop putting yourself down, and stop deprieving of all the things you deserve. Its easy to think positive in good times tho, but what about when things go wrong? I dont think a book can tell you that, what u need is to have faith within. So what youre really looking for wont find in a book, but in yourself. This book wont make u happy, you will. Thats the real secret.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Excellent video. Cover a little worn, but in very good condition. It arrived in only a few days and I'm having a great time wathcing it. I love it!!
B000009HF2|5.0|This stands the test of time and is truly one if not the best live album ever made. With a mix of the overall genre of Rock music Frampton captures the mood of the seventy's perfectly.  His use of the voice box and the guitar solos is forever captured when he was at his prime with this record.  What can i say, I love it!
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins' classic book on creating a great company contains success principles that apply to big corporations, small clubs, and even families.<br /><br />* Level 5 Leadership (Leaders with humility and strength, but no ego)<br />* First Who, Then What (Get the right people first before deciding the direction)<br />* Confront the Brutal Facts (Create systems to face reality)<br />* Hedgehog Concept (Focus on One Big Thing that Unites Everything Else)<br />* Building Your Company's Vision (Focus on the Core Ideology and Envisioned Future)<br /><br />There are so many profound truths in this simple, yet well-researched, book. Two insights that changed my life are those of \\"Level 5 Leadership,\\" and \\"First Who, Then What.\\"<br /><br />We tend to get caught up in the charismatic, egotistical leaders that seem larger than life. Yet, these leaders' success often starts and ends with their involvement. Their legacies do not continue without them since everything depended on them. This was a big shift in the way I thought and acted. In the past, I was focused on doing everything my way. Now, I'm focused on scalable systems and replicable recipes that can grow my dreams, even without me. While you will always influence your company's culture, it is vital to create an organization that will always thrive, with or without you.<br /><br />There's a saying in venture capital that we should bet on the jockey, not on the horse. All the best laid plans are doomed to failure without the proper people who can execute on them. Everything in our lives depends on our relationships and networks. We should build those first before we build the imaginary theories and plans. You must have a sense of the direction and the strategy BEFORE you go out and make your team, but your team ultimately matters even more than your plans. Your team decides how those dreams become reality.
B001ED7C58|3.0|When I first picked up the soundtrack, I was epecting the music score to be on here. Oh well, that happens with movies, the score either gets thrown our or it's own separate track.    Anywhos, besides that the music is as expected. I feel like we've raided Meyer's personal playlist for the books. (Muse is in here as well as Linkin Park which were two of her biggest inspriations according to her web site.) Some I'd never heard before, but some sounded vaguely familliar, maybe the local alternative station played them and I happened to be listening.    Overall, every track was actually included in the movie (unlike some where you hear songs \\"inspired\\" by the movies) and I was able to envision which scenes it was. It's more driven and inspired, which is good, because I would have been mad if it lagged any. And I was not unsurprized. I will allways enjoy these songs. (I hate remixes that a lot of soundtracks do as well.)    As a fan however, I was only dissapointed by two things. 18th floor balcony was not included into the movie (but it's good enough without it) and I was surprized by the lack of any real piano music for Bella's Lullibye. (in my head it's been more complex, but alas.)

While many gave into despair and gave up their will to live, Frankl fought on to create some meaning from these horrible experiences. He believed that anything in life can be dealt with as long as we are able to find meaning in it.<br /><br />This book saved my life when I had lost everything I ever worked for. All my life I fought to be a champion. I got close to my dreams with national shows and sponsorship requests at 18, but I got severely injured.<br /><br />Doctors said I would need painkillers and Prozac for the rest of my life.

But the whole thing was about this woman's shallow thoughts and feelings here and there and her boring journey with her exaggerating some unimportant happenings in her life and making an annoying cliche out of them. I forced myself to finish this book and could easily throw it in the garbage afterwards. I don't recommend it to anyone.

0887307280|5.0|\\"Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It\\"<br /><br />The problem with small businesses is that most people work in it, rather than on it. People turn what was once a labor of love into a love of labor. They focus so much on trying to capture the moment that they stop being in the moment.<br /><br />Gerber, the world's number one small business guru, points out that there are three key roles one must master to create a successful system: the entrepreneur (the visionary), the manager (the planner), and the technician (the doer). He shows us how to create a step-by-step turn-key franchise that leverages the power of a strategic system to make a world of our own.<br /><br />This book transformed my life and my businesses to create replicable, scalable models that would succeed on their own. In the past, I wanted to do everything on my own. Because the companies relied on me to succeed, they could not function without me.<br /><br />This book shows you how to build lasting legacies that allows others to experience your version of the world.<br /><br />My life transformed with martial arts, philosophy, and psychology at 12. The next revolution happened when I was 20.<br /><br />I never realized how businesses and martial arts are exactly alike until I read this quote in The E-Myth, which was taken from Joe Hyams, who wrote the book Zen in the Martial Arts.<br /><br />\\"A dojo is miniature cosmos where we make contact with ourselves -- our fears, anxieties, reactions, and habits. It is an arena of confined conflict where we confront an opponent who is not an opponent but rather a partner engaged in helping us understand ourselves more fully. It is a place where we can learn a great deal in a short time about who we are and how we react in the world. The conflicts that take place inside the dojo help us handle conflicts that take place outside. The total concentration and discipline required to study martial arts carries over to daily life. The activity in the dojo calls on us to constantly attempt new things, so it is also a source of learning -- in Zen terminology, a source of self-enlightenment.\\"<br /><br />Gerber says, \\"That is exactly what a small business is!\\"gs, so it is also a source of learning -- in Zen terminology, a source of self-enlightenment.\\"    Gerber says, \\"That is exactly what a small business is!\\"
B001DHXT1G|2.0|Hulkamania is back on the screen! He's green! He's mean! He's ...uh ...green and mean.<br /><br />With less than five years separating Ang Lee's 2003 version entitled simply [[ASIN:B001DRF84W Hulk]], French director Louis Leterrier (who's done a few questionable films in the recent past, including [[ASIN:B000JSI7BW Transporter 2]] and DANNY THE DOG aka [[ASIN:B000A2IPQY Unleashed]]), takes up the Marvel comic book reigns and takes a shot at the pi$$ed off Bruce Banner.<br /><br />Replacing Erica Bana ([[ASIN:B000F1IQN2 Munich]]) as the Hulk/Bruce Banner is film star Edward Norton ([[ASIN:B000NOIX48 The Painted Veil]]). Norton's film repertoire up to now has been fairly superlative: [[ASIN:6305313687 American History X]], [[ASIN:B00006CXI1 Death to Smoochy]], [[ASIN:B00003W8NM Fight Club]], [[ASIN:B0000B1OFL The Italian Job]], [[ASIN:B000GDH9NM Down in the Valley]], The Illusionist, and several other high caliber films decorate his resume, so I was expecting another engaging film from him. Although I found his performance to be good, the story suffered from a lack of direction; it's goal seeming to be only to tell you that another film is coming with the Hulk's involvement. In other words, no plot.<br /><br />Marvel has had a couple of successes lately, though, and one can't necessarily knock them for doing what they're doing, which is setting comic book fans up for \\"something big\\". Their highest claim to fame is undoubtedly Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr. I loved Iron Man. Downey Jr. encapsulated the character and was both funny and cocky. A great match. But here, with THE INCREDIBLE HULK, we get a mish-mash of quality.<br /><br />Part of the problem is undeniably due to the fact that this film comes off the heals of Ang Lee's version. Lee's Hulk was anything but perfect, let's make that perfectly clear. But it did reinvent Hulk and gave us a unique look at the dynamics behind the character. Here in The Incredible Hulk, we get a forced love story (with no background, really), an intro to the Abomination, and lots and lots (and LOTS) of guns. The Abomination's inclusion will obviously play a vital part in upcoming films, and I appreciate that, but let's tell a good story along with it. Lee's Hulk, at the very least, did that.<br /><br />There are a few positive qualities here, though. The cast is fairly strong except for another wooden performance by William Hurt (Into the Wild). He seemed to be just going through the motions. There's also the fact that the film feels more like the television series, jumping us right into Bannon's life and his isolation due to his medical condition. We also get a glimpse of the original Hulk, Lou Ferrigno (if you pay attention).<br /><br />But these positives do not outweigh the negatives. Lacking any real direction, The Incredible Hulk is interesting eye-candy with plenty of action but little substance ...which made me turn a bit green.Abomination, and lots and lots (and LOTS) of guns.

Sadly, they shipped a product that was damaged before they processed my order.  The CD case was severely cracked with pieces missing.  The missing pieces were not inside the shrink-wrapped packaging which lets me know it was damaged prior to packaging, and they shipped it anyway.    There was no info on what to do if an order was damaged or how to return an item.    I am a techno-dummy and am not very computer savvy, but I do know this much.

B001DTPZNY|2.0|Still the same bad plot and horrible ending. Some movies, especially those recently revisited by Lucas, grow on me over time. I'm a big Star Wars fan, and Episodes 1-3, for the most part, did. I really wanted to like this movie since I still have fond memories of seeing the first three in the theaters as a kid. This one, with it's over the top plot, bad acting by Cate Blanchett, and low marks on the believability scale, just doesn't fit in with the other three Jones movies. It just could have been so much better. No wonder Harrison Ford held off on making this one for so long. He wanted to be old enough so the memory of it probably wouldn't last too long.     Maybe my son will like it someday since it's really a kid's movie. Until then, it'll be on the shelf collecting dust.

So I finally gave in and was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  My son did have to explain a few things for me (he had watched it in english class), but it really is entertaining.  Plus it gave me some quality time with my 17 year old son.  Another plus was the great music.
0767821629|4.0|Unlike what other reviewers received, and contrary to Amazon's product description, I actually got a \\"flip disc\\" with the full screen version on one side and the 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen version on the other.    The video/audio quality is very good, the scan has good contrasts and the print shows no scratches or dust. The extras are OK, but there is not much.    Compared to the previous movie modeled after \\"Simulacron-3\\" (which I have not read), \\"Welt am Draht\\" by Fassbinder, this version has few hollywood style \\"feel-good\\" changes to the story. It's a decent movie on it's own, but I missed some of the elements that made \\"World on a Wire\\" stick out, and there are a few plot holes.
B0000057D8|4.0|Pinnock and the English Concert manage to imbue these popular pieces with both originality and good taste on period instruments. Other ensembles might throw all caution to the wind in striving for a sort of punk Baroque, still others might strip them of excitement and make them appropriate dinner music, but Pinnock and company take a just-the-other-side-of-moderate approach which is both ingratiating and mostly enlivening.<br /><br />I had once been put off by extended listening to the often strident tones of the period instruments here, seemingly exacerbated by the early digital recording (1982). However, a slight cut in the upper-treble and slight boost in the mid and lower-bass seems to have alleviated that problem.

0767802519|5.0|Jean Reno as \\"The Professional\\" brings to film a killer version of a man who is hesitant about life and rigid about relationships. That the movie comes under the guise of a hitman, or cleaner as Leon calls himself, is merely the dressing for the real story--the relationship between Leon and Matilda.<br /><br />Matilda is the 12-year-old daughter of a scumbag, small-time drug dealer, who has little control of himself, eases his frustrations through his hot wife and against his young daughter, Matilda. She is supposed to be in boarding school and out of the way when a DEA officer comes for his cocaine or retribution. Gary Oldman is the agent with his staff of crooked cops and dope dealers. Matilda escapes murder when her neighbor, Leon, takes her in.<br /><br />Natalie Portman as Matilda is pubescent and childishly provocative in an unintentional way. Their relationship deepens as he trains Matilda in the craft of \\"cleaning.\\" Trust buds. His heart, so closed, much like Silas Marner, gradually opens to Matilda's openness, much like Eppie's. The difference is, of course, the time period. Silas and Eppie had a father-daughter relationship because it was merry ole England in the Victorian Period. Leon and Matilda live in the Italian area of New York--he is a killer, she is the daughter of a drug dealer. Boundaries are much less strict.<br /><br />Even though Leon always remains fatherly toward Matilda, given time, that stance may have changed, and probably would to the satisfaction of them both. But that Lolita position never arrived because the Oldman character intervened.<br /><br />The story with all its corruption of character, hardness of heart, violence to the max, ends in a pastoral-like scene. Matilda is rooted.

B001C08RHA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It's one of those rare events where I felt as though someone had climbed into my head and figured out what I'd like. The special effects never get in the way. You kind of only know they are there because, well, we know we can't do some of that incredible stuff in real life today - not yet anyway.    When I heard Robert Downey Jr. was playing the lead part, I had my doubts, but I now stand convinced he was/is the right guy for the role.    I hope though that the criminals in the next installment have higher IQs than those in this one. At the beginning when Tony Stark was captured and locked in the cave, why would they place him in a room full of weapons to make weapons, not put men in the room to supervise him directly and not expect him to use all that technology to break out? After all, he is a well reknown genius.    Nevertheless, this movie is definitely watchable and re-watchable. Jeff Bridges worked well in the movie too, though I couldn't help thinking he was playing Kris Kristofferson playing the role of Obadiah.    All said, it is, in a word, fantastic.

B001EYGOEM|4.0|I fell in love with \\"Fearless\\" after only one listen! I have been a fan of Taylor's since \\"Tim McGraw\\" and I thought her debut was superb; yet her sophomore album blows the first out of the water.    On \\"Fearless\\", Taylor writes and sings about what she knows best - teenage love. The emotions seem so genuine, the hooks are catchy, and the music is infectious. Although I am in my early 20s, I find myself relating to almost every song on this album - which for me is the sign of a great music. Taylor's voice makes you relive your first kiss, your first day of high school, your first heart break and everything in between.    My favorite songs are \\"Fearless\\" (who hasn't loved someone who made us feel fearless?), \\"Hey, Stephen\\" (such a fun, cutesy, catchy song), \\"You're Not Sorry\\" (not only can I relate to this song, but I love the piano background) and \\"The Way I Loved You\\" (because sometimes we can't appreciate what we have when we want something else). Out of the 13 songs, I really enjoy them all except for the last two (\\"The Best Day\\" and \\"Change\\").    Overall, the only critique I can see about this album is that regardless of what Taylor and Nashville tries to sell us - THIS IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC. Not at all. While this is still a GREAT cd, there is little on \\"Fearless\\" that says \\"country music.\\" This may bother some fans of country and country radio as Taylor (and her contemporaries) have come to dominate the country scene. If you're looking for great, tradtional country music by a female; try LeAnn Womack's \\"Call Me Crazy\\" - another 4/5 star album.     Lastly, some people have complained about the lyrics and storytelling on \\"Fearless\\"; I have heard gripes that all Taylor sings about is \\"teenage love drama\\" - which may not appeal to everyone. Well, what do you expect from 18-year-old Taylor? Songs about loveless marriages and cheating affairs? Taylor writes - and sings - about what she knows and that is what makes her song so special and memorable.    I LOVE \\"FEARLESS\\" AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE!!!
B000000WFF|5.0|First off I'm quite amazed, it seems EVERY other review on here is about the movie!! Well this is not the VHS, DVD or blu-ray, you have clicked on the CD version of Spiceworld, aka the very bearable soundtrack to the movie.    This album is great. Listening to it makes me realise what a lost society we live in now, where barely an original tune is released anymore. Spiceworld takes me back to not only my early teen years, but back to when music was great. The melodies are superb and catchy, and the lyrics mean something worthwile. Now for my song reviews:        1. Spice Up Your Life - 3/5. My least favourite track on the album, the one time I felt the girls had been pressured into a particular type of song to appeal for the first single. It's not bad, but it's not up to the Spice Girls standards.    2. Stop - 4.5/5. Terrific, a lot of people's favourite track. It's upbeat, and fun, and has a terrific climax.    3. Too Much - 4/5. A very sweet yet sexy sort of song that cold be construed as this album's \\"2 Become 1\\". Listening to it, you can just tell it's classic Britpop (what ever happened to that, btw?).    4. Saturday Night Divas - 4/5. Another of those fun songs that could easily appeal to the brainless no-taste kids out there who only like music to dance to, but it also packs a very catchy original tune, and it just gels really, really well. Will get stuck in your head for days.    5. Never Give Up On The Good Times - 5/5. My person favourite of all Spice Girls songs. I remember when I first heard it, I was sure I'd heard it before somewhere. Never did find out, but I guess I didn't, perhaps it's just that original that you feel like you've heard it before because it's so good.  Anyway, this is a long one (clocks in at 4 and a half minutes!!) but that's because there's so much there. It starts of with frogs (yeah, frogs), and then jumps into a head-nodding beat, and then the strings come in and take over the show. As usual, Mel C's strong and unique voice is used to good effect here (Never give it up, no; never give it up, no). Can't get any better than this, if it's your sort of thing.    6. Move Over - 3.5/5. Generation Next, which I sang as Generation X for about 10 years... This is another fun one that goes just that one step further so it doesn't seal its fate as another forgettable pop tune. It's probably near the bottom of the pile in terms of favourites, but it's still very good and catchy.    7. Do It - 4/5. From the get-go Mel C's voice \\"duetting\\" with itself tells you that you're in for a great original British song (aren't we the best?). This song is about doing what you want and not caring what others think. I can't get over how such a cool, hip tune (even in today's society) is able to add genuinely touching moments in between. Quite wonderful and catchy.    8. Denying - 4/5. Same as above. Hip, catchy as hell, and with touching moments. This song has just that bit more substance than the rest because it's dealing with someone who thinks they're better than everyone else.    9. Viva Forever - 4/5. The prettiest song on the album, it's clearly inspired by Geri \\"Ginger\\" Halliwell's background. Very Spanish sounding, but with those awesome strings put to good use again, and a tune that is actually remarkably beautiful. If the music video hadn't been so stupid, I'd give it 4.5.    10. The Lady Is A Tramp - 4.5/5. What fun! Scrap the past 40 years of music development and go straight back into the good old jazz/Chicago-esque style. My Dad, who's in his late 60s, loves this song. And so do I. It's just so completely unexpected from the Girls and it's original to boot. Go back in time and release this as a record single, nobody will know the difference and it'd be a hit then too. The ending is terrific and sends chills down my spine. As with every song on this album, I recommend playing it really loud on an excellent sound system.      So there you go. I honestly believe every track on this album could have been anumber 1 hit had they been given the chance, but the fact that the album was #1 for so long shows just how terrific the music is. I'd say this album will go down in history... just as soon as these emo people stop taking over the music world and brandishing everything as shamefully lame. I'll sit and listen to this while I wait. :)

It's another film I found on a \\"most controversial movies\\" list and decided I had to watch, just because I could.  I read a lot about it before I decided to view it and truthfully, it felt like an endurance test to pass so I could say I did it, but I never want to look back!  It does need to be seen to believed, but it's not enjoyable and I feel a little less human after voluntarily watching it.
B000UD0ESA|4.0|I think Blade Runner was one of Harrison Ford's best movies.<br />  The version I first saw when it came out in the theaters had the Harrison Ford voice over and I will probably purchase that some day if I can find it since my old copy on VHS has dissolved.<br />  The second disc was interesting in all the background it gave, but I really enjoyed the original version with HR giving a from-the-gut narrative<br />like the PI's of old radio fame like Bull Dog Drummond et al.
B000002ITW|4.0|Yes there are moments on this recording that will make you wince or smile.  It depends on your perspective.  But there are other times (deep in jams of 'Carry On' or 'Southern Man') where these creative minds mesh and it is a wonder to behold.  A second or 2, as the songs end, a pause as if the audience's jaws have to close before they can voice their approval.  And it's easy to visualize the grins flashing between band members as the sonic dust clears.  In my opinion, get this, Allman's  'live at the fillmore', and Stones 'get yer yaya's out', and you would have a pretty good idea of how live rock oughta be. Whatever the decade!

This book delivers that, as well as well-drawn, nuanced characters, sly wit, and tremendously detailed and thoroughly researched descriptions of life at sea in the Napoleonic Wars. Rarely do I return to a book once I've read it, but I've revisited these novels again and again, and they never fail to entertain me.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|The title keeps it's promise. Very enlightening and historical setting. I DO wonder how much anti-capitalism sentimentalism affected the reality or accuracy of some of the plot.  Upton Sinclair was a big socialist-- I read his book, the JUNGLE, during my first year working in a beef packinghouse.  Also, very enlightening, as long as you know the mindset of the author.    I suspect that it WAS very cut-throat back then.  Still, I feel like there was some liberal interpretation in the story telling.  STILL-- IT IS A GREAT MOVIE.  Scotty/Sioux City

B001FW2R5I|5.0|The album is really fun music with an 80´s kind of influence in the arrangement of Keane´s beautiful melodies plus lyrics that convey a deep sense of being that connects instantly with anyone who listens.
B001KO3FFW|4.0|I'm not an American Idol avid viewer, but David Cook here has got some good material. I most definitely enjoyed the song \\"Heroes\\", it sounded like an Our Lady Peace song. The album shows David's vocal versatility, I would say there's a fair amount of diversity in this album not to make you bored.     I think this album sounds like Lifehouse,and Nickelback, gearing towards the POP audience rather than the ALTERNATIVE music audience. After all, David Cook is the winner of a pop star search. Like I said I'm not a solid AI viewer, but when I heard of David Cook's version of \\"Always be my baby\\" I became a fan of his, and wasn't surprised that he won the contest, he deserves it.    On another note, if any of you ever heard of his former band AXIUM I think they sounded like CREED, I think I expected this album to sound the same , but it didn't.    All in all, the album is worth listening to, and I think David Cook fans and alternative music fans won't be disappointed when they get their hands on this album.

B000WTBMBK|3.0|Slightly too technical. There are few good ideas, but unfortunately the whole album is repeating itself. Although the album is probably meant to serve completely different realms of style, surprisingly the vocals and beats composition remind me of nineties beginning house style. I'm not sure if we are far enough to recycle that already. I don't know about the composer(s), but there is a strong sense of youth in it. Whoever they are, they are young. But please, I do not regret this buy.
0670019925|1.0|If only the novel had lived up to its breathtaking opening paragraph, which the author read with such dead-on sensitivity in a recent WNYC Lopate interview. What an ear, even from the near-silence of the head. I expect we'll see more and better work from Lodge yet--maybe more in the vein of this work's astounding opening and his existing oeuvre. Many reviews of this work seem to be in the publisher's pocket--many of Amazon's &#34;Editorial Reviews&#34; first among them, of course. Peter Kramer's review in Slate (also viewable online for free in a click) nails it--thanks for telling the truth instead of selling out, Mr. Kramer. I try to take most editorial reviews with a bale of salt--they want to sell you the book, just as the publishers and authors do. It's helpful to try to include objective, non-lobbyist professional reviews from elsewhere before buying.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|Frankly, in the mist of time back to the days of my childhood, I was both fearful and delighted by the stories and illustrations of the famous English children's' book writer and illustrator who is the subject of this film, Ms. Beatrix Potter. Perhaps it was fear of the size of the animals in the editions that I would receive from a great aunt. Or because that aunt was poor but thoughtful it might have been the black and white illustrations in the editions that I received. (I was rather startled to see in this film that her work during her lifetime, at her fervent request to her publishers, was done in multi-colors.) Be that as it may be there are a couple of points that I want to make about this very interesting and well-acted film (particularly by Rene Zellweger as Ms.  Potter) which on the face of it would seem outside the parameters of the kind of thing that would interest me and the kinds of subjects that I tend to write about in this space.    I am not sure how faithfully the creators of this film were to the biography of Ms. Potter's life, however, for my purpose that is neither here nor there. The story line here concerns (aside from the various romantic interests which a commercial film seemingly cannot do without even with accomplished middle class educated women like Ms. Potter or Ms. Jane Austen) the public flowering of the her story telling and illustrative talents under the guidance of a member of her publishing company (and eventual doom-struck lover) in early 20th century England.     That, of course, is a feat worthy of recognition in and of itself as this is the height of the Victorian period in that country. Her pluck and fortitude as she runs up against the ill wishes of her middle class but very class conscious parents (particularly dear Mrs. Potter) is one of the themes that drive this film. Another is the fate of a thirty-two year old unmarried woman who, moreover, is not concerned about being married if it interferes with her chances for artistic success. Fair enough, but Mother England (to speak nothing of Mother Potter) does not approve.   Finally, this film is a nice look at the fate of the creative artist who is in searching for her self-expression faces at least some condescension for being, merely, a children's' book writer (especially when she could be a ...wife and mother).     Those are the interesting themes presented in this film. The way that Ms. Potter struggles and perseveres to become an independent person with her own resources and navigate her own course through life is another in a now long series of female \\"uplift\\" films.  This one is a worthy addition to that genre. As to the downside of Ms. Potter's story. The period under discussion was one of great social turmoil in England. This is, after all, the heyday of the women's suffragette movement led by the like of Sylvia Pankhurst (and her sister and mother) and of the emergence of a British Labor party led by Keri Hardie as well as other social experiments. There is no sense in this film that Ms. Potter was aware of such movements or much interested in them.     No one expects an artist, a creative artist to boot, per se to devote their talents for the greater good of their society in a political way. However it helps. Ms. Potter did begin to display a little of that consciousness toward the end of the movie, after she broke from her family and set on her own course, and set up independently in the country and attempted to preserve her Lake District surroundings. But rather than belabor that point let me end with this thought. When we fight for and get a more just society than we have now then maybe there will be time and space enough for a thousand thousand Beatrix Potters to flourish. Until then watch this film and do not be afraid to read her little books with those little animal drawings.
B0010X745K|5.0|This is what movies are all about! It's gripping, suspenseful, eerie. I rent movies and easily get distracted if the movie is boring or stupid. This movie was so worth watching, I preferred to hold my piss until the movie was finished. I didn't even know my wife was sitting next to me during the film. I highly recommend it to anybody. The ending is shocking, however, the movie has a message and not just a brainless sci-fi thriller with cool special effects. Great cinematography, excellent casting, and pretty original. I read some negative reviews here but I'm afraid this movie was actually a lot better than what I read. Thanks Stephen King because now I want to buy it. Classic film work for me.
B001IF252C|1.0|Frankly, I find it offensive that Apple would release the new Macbook Pro's with Displayport connectors that are NOT backwards compatible with their 30 inch Cinema displays WITHOUT this hundred dollar cable that's STILL not available.<br /><br />Here's why this sucks.<br />1. Proprietary cable means nobody else makes one, so we're stuck waiting for apple.<br />2. Apple dragged it's butt getting these out the door. Nearly 2 months after the new Macbook Pro's were delivered.<br />3. A hundred bucks for the cable? Are you F'n serious? For a DVI cable! That's blasphemy!<br /><br />In closing, I expect more from apple, and as I sit here with my new Macbook Pro, looking at my 30 inch display that I'm unable to use until Christmas because of a cabling issue, I find myself disgusted.

055358894X|2.0|Desperate to find something to read in between Hobb's, George R.R. Martin's, Guy Gavriel Kay's, C.S. Friedman's and Donaldson's latest, I chose this title primarily based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I've been reading fantasy for over 25 years and appreciate all the aspects of world building, so was considerably dismayed when I saw my very own American foul language peppered throughout the pages of this fantasy.  And despite all the rave reviews, I would argue the plot plods, the characters are two dimensional and the \\"twists and turns\\" become annoyingly repetitive and predictable half way through the tome. I feel no pathos for the orphan who only finds purpose in life when he seeks revenge. To keep this review short and put it bluntly, this book bored me enough to write my second review ever.
B0017M8XS6|5.0|This is basically the ultimate version of Brain Salad Surgery, and while I probably wouldn't suggest this as a first-time purchase for any newbie to the works of ELP, it's nice for the dedicated fan.  Here, you have the album in 3 forms--the original, remastered, on CD #1, which is the same remaster, as other reviewers have noted, as the one initially made for the now-defunct Victory Music label in 1993, the first time the ELP catalogue was properly remastered away from the first CD run with Atlantic (and I have memories of the CD version of The Best of Emerson, Lake & Palmer--a mix so low you had to crank the volume to 11 just to hear anything, which made \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\" sound as if the mics were placed near the back of a medium-large auditorium and the band recorded in that position).<br /><br />On CD #2, you have the outtakes--the first attempt at \\"When the Apple Blossoms Bloom in the Windmills of Your Mind, I'll Be Your Valentine\\" (which didn't see official release until Works, Vol. 2, in late 1977) and the completely unreleased-until-now title cut, \\"Brain Salad Surgery,\\" which has elements of all the tracks that did appear on the album (save perhaps \\"Benny the Bouncer\\").  In addition, first mixes of \\"Toccata\\" and \\"Karn Evil 9: 3rd Impression,\\" and new stereo mixes of all the tracks, plus an excerpt from the New Musical Express interview flexidisc of the time.  Worthy additions all, for the completist fan.<br /><br />And CD #3?  A hybrid SACD of the album; this is the 5.1 Surround Sound mix used on Rhino's DVD-A release of 1999 (Rhino R9-75980), but it is improved notably.  My problem with DVD-As has been that, often, the mix is such that certain tracks seem to have been lowered inexplicably (a problem I noted especially with the DVD-As included in the Genesis remasters and in the DVD-A of Richard Thompson's Rumor and Sigh album--hey, EMI, could we have a hybrid SACD of that one, please?).  This problem, thankfully, does not exist with the hybrid SACD, and this remix sounds better.<br /><br />So if Deluxe Editions of this type are what you're looking for in your favourite classic rock albums, Brain Salad Surgery will be a worthy investment for you.  (As of this writing, we're still waiting for a similar version of Black Sabbath's Paranoid, which was initially slated for release at the same time as the Deluxe BSS--Amazon's US site notes the release date as having been pushed back to 6 Jan. 2009, so we'll see what happens.)sounds better.

1594201927|4.0|Niall Ferguson has published another sweeping book, this time in his purported field of expertise in financial history, not in political economic history, where he had most famously written 'The War of the World.' For that one must be grateful, since his neo-imperialistic views, sensational support of empires and subjugation, and controversial justifications of Nazism, were just too jarring.    Here he makes an ambitious attempt to tell the whole story of finance. It begins in Mesopotamia and ends in the credit crisis of 2008. The title is a play off the title of Jacob Bronowski's Ascent of Man. Overall it is a considerably worse book than Birth of Plenty by William Bernstein, and even more so when compared to Empire of Wealth, a recent book on economic history. It cannot replace Peter Bernstein's trilogy, including Against the Gods, Gold and Capital Ideas. It lacks the details of Vincent Carruso's Investment Banking in America or other detailed tales of financial history. Yet it lacks synthesis too, certainly when compared to Birth of Plenty or Bernstein's trilogy.It is worth buying though, hence the 4 stars, but only for a quick jog through history, not for an understanding of it.       The book does not delve deep into the details, which  is its weakness. It does not give a bird's eye view either, because the vignettes he chooses, the facts he emphasizes, and the stories he stresses are generally the unimportant ones. That flaw is not only true of ancient finance, about which he may not be an expert, but also so of medieval and modern financial history, an area in which he should have better selected the stories he chose to emphasize.     What the author ends up doing is overemphasizing stories about the Rothschilds, who he covered in a bio years ago, or about current events, including ones about the current credit crisis, which seems oddly placed (and likely added at the last minute, once the markets collapsed and the book likely appeared too  optimistic). Thereare at least two references to the compensation of Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, anecdotes which would be out of place in any serious history of finance. Then there are the detailed discussions about some obtuse scandal in Britain but hardly the same space to Enron or Milken or other scandals which have plagued history.    Not only is the selection of stories poorly done but the level of the narrative also fluctuates between sweeping statements unsupported by the facts (a habit of Niall Ferguson) or minute details about this or that, very often irrelevant to boot, leaving the book appear put together in a hurry (which too is a longstanding weakness of the author). There is the mathematical formula of the Black-Sholes, which seems out of place in a short history of finance, and especially so since the author claims he does not even understand what it means. The points made could surely have been driven home without the formula.    Third and worst still is the decision of the author (or his research assistant) to summarize issues into five or six bullet points, a la a McKinsey presentation. This occurs in several places, with paragraph headings (!) and summaries, a style unsuitable for a history book, and truly not even used by newspapers. One does not buy a book to rush through issues in bullet points!    Fourth, the author has tacked onto the end of the book a note about the Descent of Finance. Clearly he does so to tone down the story, to fit the current collapse of the markets, but there too he insists on playing on Charles Darwin's Descent of Species, much as his title plays off Jacob Bronowski's Ascent of Man. The only problem is that the title of the Epilogue must convey the current sad state of affairs, and it does, but to explain the title as having a double meaning, that it also refers to the organic evolution of finance, is too kitchy and clumsy. Such clever simplicities pervade the book.    Finally, the book inevitably also misses the mark on account of the messenger. Niall Ferguson is at his best a neo-imperialist who believes in the superiority of one dominant empire, versus today's multipolar world. Such a stance cannot but weaken both his credibility and capability in explaining finance, which is at its core a diffused, democratic, even chaotic, system. In sum thus, this book is too quickly written, too carelessly put together and too clumsy in its conclusions to have a long shelf life.

0451169514|5.0|Well, every author disappoints at SOME point in their career, but this is not that point for author Stephen King.  Though the title is simply one word, it conveys all the eerie simplicity of the book itself.<br /><br />The story jumps between contemporary times (1985, contemporary when the book was written and published) and the horrifying experiences of seven friends' childhoods, in the summer of 1958.  While most books of this intensity cover spans of 20 years in epic form, this book takes place over the course of just three months.<br /><br />Seven 11-year-old kids battle the unspeakable evil that has permeated their small Maine town of Derry.  King captures the creepy feel of small New England towns in a way that grips the reader, making it impossible to put the book down even as the descriptions grow grisly and nightmarish.  These seven youngsters are brought together in adulthood to repeat their fantastic journey and defeat that same evil once and for all, if they can recapture the magic of childhood.  A task every adult in the world attempts at least once.<br /><br />Most of Stephen King's fans know he writes himself into almost every story.  Some part of him finds its way into the characters and places, giving the reader a glimpse of the man behind the book.  In \\"It\\", we see not only a glimpse, but an entire novel of King himself, played out in the twists and turns of his own fantasies.  This fact makes the book all the more haunting, chilling, and terrifying.<br /><br />While I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good long scare (it takes a solid week to read through, as it DOES jump around a bit), I would not recommend this or any other King novel to those young enough to still think of that favorite four-letter-word as \\"the f-word\\".  Like all his other works, It does not scrimp on the foul language, nor does it balk at concepts no child should entertain (physical and sexual abuse, kids smoking, grisly deaths, not to mention the psychological ramifications of a demonic clown that can change into any monster it wants).hat can change into any monster it wants).

B001GQACGO|3.0|So I really like Beyonce and have liked her since Destiny's Child and all her past albums I have played to death.  However...this one, eh, not so much.  I will say that her slow songs are pretty nice-I like Halo a lot.  On the flip side, a lot of the songs sound the same to me.  But I did like her take on Ave Maria.  However, the upbeat or fast songs-HATED IT!  I am not feeling them AT ALL...the beats get on my nerves, and even her voice on a few of the songs, such as Radio, irk me too.  I really am not even all that crazy about Single Ladies, although it's grown on me slightly.  I was pretty disappointed.  I know some people say you have to let the album \\"grow on you\\" but I have played it like 3 times straight and I just can't get into it.  Ironically, Solange's album that came out a few months ago is pure fire and I play it over and over again.  Who knew?
1573226521|5.0|When utopia goes wrong! A very good read - definitely a new favorite. I don't think it has the makings of a classic but interesting characters, great environmental descriptions. And here's a surprise, better than the movie (which was also good).
B000XTLUW0|4.0|This is a great album.  The music of Muse is going to be great no matter how you listen to it.  I tend to prefer studio albums to live ones, which is the only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5.  So I think the degree to which one would enjoy this album has to do mostly with whether you like live or studio.  In the end, it is still a great collection of songs from one of the greatest bands around.  Definitely worth buying.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|This was the hulk movie I was waiting for.  This had a nod to both the tv show and the comic books.  I loved it because Edward Norton is a great actor and it is connected to other parts of the marvel universe such as Iron Man.  I did not hate the last Hulk movie, but it was not as good.  If this were a basketball game this would score 20, and the 2003 version 5.  I would say people who are Incredible Hulk fans of the TV show or Comics should watch this
B0000AUHPG|2.0|A previous reviewer said best western ever. NO WAY. It has the star power but EXTREMELY SLOW going and way too many cliches. Waste of the star power!
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Hard to be sure if this film's \\"must-see\\" factor would have been as intense had Ledger not died before its release.  Certainly the previews looked good, and the viral marketing campaign was interesting though not compelling.<br /><br />This film was, is, and will forever be anchored by Ledger's performance as The Joker.  Too bad the rest of the film doesn't match his level.  Truthfully, I liked \\"The Dark Knight\\" a lot.  Saw it several times in the theatres.  But it most certainly has its flaws.  There are plenty of lapses in logic (narrative flow, not \\"realism\\") and several moments that are just not done very well.<br /><br />Many fans of this movie are touting director Christopher Nolan as a \\"genius\\" for the way he crafted this movie.  \\"Genius\\"?  Please. Let's ease up on the fanboy hyperbole, shall we?  He did a competent job but he is no genius.  Any one of several talented writer/directors could have done equally well if not better.<br /><br />Don't let your enthusiasm for the product, which was quite possibly stimulated and inflated by well over a year of pent-up excitement for the film's release, color your objectivity.<br /><br />The previous Nolan \\"Batman\\" film \\"Batman Begins\\" suffered from some choppy editing that was jarring and distracting.  This film has slightly less of that but still has pacing issues.  The movie feels more like a series of moments strung together rather than a story with a smooth flow.<br /><br />During my first viewing of this film I was thoroughly entertained by several segments of it but thoroughly bothered by moments that we handled lazily, sloppily, and even amateurishly.<br /><br />This film is an improvement over \\"Batman Begins\\", but it is bouyed by a much more interesting villain. The bad editing that sank so many parts of \\"Batman Begins\\" crop up in this movie here and there too.<br /><br />I don't know if Nolan will helm another \\"Batman\\" film, but if he does I hope he chooses a better film editing team.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|[[ASIN:B001DDBCUA Sex and the City - The Movie (Widescreen Edition)]] I didn't expect to like this movie and was pleasantly surprised.  It had all the same emotion and fun of the TV series. The stars remained true to the characters they had created for television and we watched them grow into their new lives and still remaining best friends.  The men in their lives understood this sisterhood and embrassed it, therefore becoming integral to these women.  All said I have watched this movie three or four times so far and all of my girl friends have equally enjoyed it.  Give it a 4 star, hands down.

B0000542D2|5.0|When you are dealing with a myth you have to look for what was new at the time when that myth appeared. And the Beatles are such a myth. This film reveals the fabric the myth is made of. Pure cinematographic and even photographic silk. The four boys have to be running because at the time everything young and new was on the run since it was chased by the establishment in order to be pilloried and exposed. But it also had to show how these four young men had to be able to capture the attention of other people and bring them into the running, first of all young people, particularly girls, and second the best representatives of the establishment, coppers. The film also had to be in black and white to be out of time, eternal because looking old, even odd or oddly even. Then and but their music did not have to convince their audience. It was new, fresh, lively, light, slightly rocky and rather smoothly rolly, with some drums but not too much, and a lot of harmony and melody, but the main attraction was the use of simple catch phrases to express love, freedom, desire, alienation and yet liberation in a mellow and sweet wrapping, like the cute title of the film taken from one of the songs.  Finally the film had to satisfy the audience on the lifestyle of the Beatles and on their surrealistic reality. That is done with a plot based on their real life as musicians, etc, and at the same time with constant reference to impossible, at times absurd, breaches in this realism into some impossible meaningless or humoristic pranks. In one word the film is so real that it reaches beyond reality and even the virtuality of a life imagined as being out of logic.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

B000MR9D5E|3.0|This film is crucial if we want to understand the present debate on climate change. The climate is changing as it has always done. But it seems to be changing more dramatically and warming up slightly though it is still a long way cooler than it was at the time of the dinosaurs. The position defended here by Attenborough is moralistic more than anything else. We are supposed to feel compassion for polar bears and to be afraid of the future. Such a fascination for apocalyptic predictions is quite typical of the Jewish or Christian tradition, with some roots in older Indo-European religious mythologies. This apocalyptic literature is often, and by far, the best and most inspiring inspiration in these traditions. But does it have any real foundation? According to Attenborough it is the truth, full stop, period, dead end, let's get ready for it. He follows the model of the now famous carbon dioxide and green house gases and global warming up theory. And exclusively this one. Then he considers the main cause is the production - or liberation - of carbon dioxide by human activities, particularly the use of fossil fuels. In other words he uses his pointer a little bit too much and of course ends up pointing at the Chinese and their becoming the first polluter in the world, ahead of the US, but he forgets to say they are at least four times more numerous for a level of development that is evaluated by the CIA to be around 80% of the US. When he is not pointing at people he is pointing at the only things we can do to reduce our production of carbon dioxide. And he does not see this totally negative approach cannot really work because people do not want to be made to feel guilty all the time, and then, in this perspective, we will have to set regulations and a cop behind every human activity. He forgets the basic human principle, and even vital principle for all that is alive at least on this planet, that has been totally negated by western development, by this short-sighted development at all costs, the fact that humanity has managed to emerge by using the basic living principle that all activities must produce more energy or value than it consumes and that the consumption of energy has to be as low as possible for the profit margin to be as high as possible. To be soundly economic life has to be economical. And our free and extremely wasteful consumption of energy - and everything else, including human life - is anti-economic because it is un-economical. That is the very first principle we must refer to: we must not use one gram of energy more than what we need. The second principle is also basic to all forms of life: a living being uses his environment to live - and/or survive - but it does not pollute it. And strangely enough humans seem to have been only interested in visible pollution. All that is not visible does not seem to bother them. That's the only positive aspect of the film: it reveals one invisible pollution, carbon dioxide. It also reveals that what is not immediately catchable by human senses does not seem to exist for human beings. I personally think here that it is better to mobilize the sense of cleanliness human life has always demonstrated - even if that sense has been increasing across centuries and will go on increasing - rather than the guilt we are supposed to feel when thinking of our grandchildren. This argument about our descendents is the reversal of another human principle. In all civilizations including ours till recently, the younger generation was there to take care of the older one when needed and not the reverse. The argument used by Attenborough means that we consider the younger generation is unable to assume their responsibilities. We are making them childish and dependent. We should expect them to be more reasonable than us and not the reverse, which does not excuse our own foolishness which is foolishness in itself and not as for the consequences on our descendents. This leads me to a final remark. Has the West been developing along a line that negates all human traditions and logic? I have like the impression that yes it has. We must then reverse that mistake but not with cops and regulations or guilt complexes but with economic  and economical arguments. And that should not prevent us from studying other climatic models particularly the one based on water vapor, which Attenborough does not do at all. Note, as a final kick at the sandbag of blind if not biased ideology, that Attenborough does not even take into account that if we learned new cooking method based on microwave oven we could cut by half our consumption n of energy for all forms of cooking, and frying being a bad dietary habit, the light browning we can get with microwaves has to be healthier than all that carbonizing we produce in a frying pan.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesk.

B0010X73ZG|5.0|Just loved this movie. Bible thumper is a real convincing act. Painful end. I actually rented it a few times before purchasing. Love Thomas Jane and King so the purchase was inevitable.
B0000509C4|3.0|Creepshow was a howling horror classic.  With a great set of stories, and fun twists in the story lines.  The animation in this second film set the bar much lower than the first.  It is only the first let down among the many revealed in the stories told.  These stories could be considered the story lines rejected for the first film.  All of them are below the standard of the first.  If you are looking for an equal to the first Creepshow you will be disappointed.  If you expect less it may be entertaining to see... once.  I have seen loads of crap DVD's so it still gets 3 stars.
0312370849|4.0|I picked this book because I'm interested in World War II fiction. This one tells about a little-known event, the Velodrome d'Hiver roundup in which hundreds of Jewish families were arrested and kept in the velodrome before being taken to the German concentration camps.    The first half of the book cuts back and forth between a story of a young girl caught in the roundup who hides her brother in a secret closet; and the first-person narrative of a middle-aged American expat journalist in 2002, sent by her editor to do an article on the sixtieh anniversary of the Vel d'Hiv.    The stories are utterly different. Sarah struggles to survive, to escape, to make it back to Paris and find her little brother again. Julia's problems are an overbearing husband with a midlife crisis and a set of in-laws who still can't seem to accept her after decades in Paris. Yet they converge as Julia realizes that her husband's family's apartment is the one that Sarah's family lived in all those years ago, culminating in a horrifying revelation.    The second half of the book is told only by Julia as she tracks down the people who knew Sarah, trying to find some kind of closure. At the same time, her marriage is on shaky ground. The sadness and rage that she finds in the trail of Sarah's life illustrate vividly how war and injustice can scar people for decades, even across generations.     I won't give any spoilers, but I have to say that the happy ending seemed more than a little contrived. That was the only major disappointment in this book.    Also, the author's identity itself has a little twist. Since the narrator of the story is an American expat in Paris, one tends to assume the same for de Rosnay, but she actually is French. Anyway, she also does a great job of simulating the perspective and emotions of someone who's lived in another country for a long time.
6305841861|4.0|Loved this movie when it came out in the 80's.  It's not scary as much as gory.  Crazy chaotic evil fun.  What the devil can happen to this guy next?  Good for making the date squirm in her seat.  There is something somewhere that will gross out just about anyone.  The FX are old school but the story is a fun rollercoaster ride of demented evil.  Enjoy!
B00009Y3L4|5.0|The play 'Cabaret' seems to evoke the atmosphere of 1930s Berlin and the tawdry desperation of that time.  The movie version is very good with vivid costumes, color and music, though I've seen a version by a local small-town theater group that I thought had a better story line.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I managed to pick this up Saturday, Nov. 22, and watched it sat night. Great Work by the boys from up north. First the sound quality is really, really good, the setlist is great. (I saw them on each leg of Snakes And Arrows tour, and they played the best I have ever seen them play.) What makes this DVD Really special is the camera work, they focus on the boys playing and on stage interaction. All concert DVDS should be filmed this way...
B00011F5DK|5.0|I originally bought this game for my classroom. The students (16-21) loved it. It was very interesting to see students who were not generally successful with more traditional classroom games thrive with this game.    I am now considering purchasing a second copy of this (and Blokus Trigon) so that I can have a copy at home and at school. It's an excellent addition to your collection.    My only concern is that with such small pieces, they could get lost very easily in my classroom. I was pleased to see what I thought was a very reasonable missing piece policy on the internet. I have not had a single piece go missing, but in the future, I will use plastic bags for my classroom copy of the game to prevent loss.
B000002AGN|5.0|Dave Brubeck Quartet's \\"Time Out\\" is a classic jazz recording and anyone who appreciates jazz needs this gem in their collection.<br /><br />The year 1959 proved to a big year for jazz having produced many of the genre's most important releases like Miles Davis' \\"Kind Of Blue,\\" Charles Mingus' \\"Mingus Ah Um,\\" Bill Evans' \\"Portrait In Jazz,\\" and John Coltrane's \\"Giant Steps.\\" This year also proved that the Dave Brubeck Quartet were force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Employing odd time signatures and ethnic timbres not widely used in jazz at the time, \\"Time Out\\" proved to be a groundbreaking success. To Columbia Record's surprise \\"Time Out\\" spawned a hit single \\"Take Five\\" and it was ranked #2 on the Billboard charts.<br /><br />All of the elements that made this group great are in place on \\"Time Out,\\" but it is my strong opinion that they made plenty of records that were just as good as this one. I would challenge anyone who's interested in this quartet to explore his other work with Paul Desmond. You will quite surprised.<br /><br />This is a classic album that is without a doubt recommended, not just by me, but the other 171 people who gave it 5-stars.
B001EO2UJK|1.0|After reading a few reviews that claimed this box had not been as badly compressed as the previous two, I went for it. Unfortunately, I have no idea what people are talking about. This box has been remixed in the same way that the last two were. It is horrible. HORRIBLE! I see some of the good reviews up here and I wonder if people have some kind of amazing new stereo that makes these sound halfway decent, because on my system these mixes sound really hard on my ears. I bought the Def. Edition CDs when they came out and I am not saying those were the best either, but I agree with those who say that this sound does not sound right for Genesis.      I won't say I feel ripped off or anything because there are lots of extras that I am enjoying. Like the Jackson Tapes and I kind of like the new mix of Happy The Man (although this also sounds really compressed), but overall I would only think this to be worthwhile if you are a Genesis freak like me who wants everything you can get. If you just want the albums, there is nothing here for you. Keep your old CDs! I did not hear the 5.1 mixes yet, so maybe those will be better, but when I saw all the good reviews for this set, I have to say that I was dumbfounded. Maybe my ears are worse than some others but I agree with those who say these sound loud and I can hear the compression clamping down sometimes (like the end of Return of the Giant Hogweed!). :(    I think Lamb is maybe the best remix here, but that's only because it isn't as trebley as some of the other albums. BUT, it still sounds so compressed! Arrggh! I miss the way Phil's drums were soft and then loud on this album and now they just sound loud all the time! The kick drum doesn't have the power it always had!! It sounds louder in volume but softer in attack. This boxset is a very frustrating listen.
B00005JPO1|3.0|After so many years Mr. Ford put on his hat again, holstered his guns and grabbed his whip along.    In the past Indy had adventures with a supernatural edge; the basics were always human in nature. It was this humanity that made the movies so great. Special effects and action scenes never make up for a loss of that.    In my opinion the supernatural has taken over. The enemy blatantly displays more-than-human abilities which borders on the banal to me and the endgame is more than over the top, instead of merely being an apotheosis of the quest that runs through the movie.    But the action was good. Fun and with an enourmous wink woven through it all.    I liked the movie, but it wasn't nowhere near the quality of the Indy's of the past. I wouldn't mind seeing another one, but this time with Indy jr. in the lead. Maybe something like young Indy Jones series, only with a bigger budget and better story.
B001EOQWFI|1.0|Wall-e is a very weak movie. The plot is extremely thin, the characters (human or otherwise) are forgettable and, worst of all, it's boring.  I can't see why people are calling it the best animated movie of all time. It doesn't work for adults because its plot is so childish and feeble, and it doesn't work for kids because it's just plain average.  The proof is in the repeated viewing. My kids will (and indeed have) watch Toy Story, Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, etc again and again and again. I can happily watch them again and again!   They never get bored with those movies and they want a Buzz doll, a cuddly Nemo, the book of Monsters Inc... they just can't get enough.  But they watched Wall-e once and maybe a half times more and that was it. No more interest. Back to Buzz and Woody and Sully and Crush.  Let's just hope Pixar's next offering is better.

B000MQC9H4|4.0|Amanda in L.A. (Cameron Diaz) and Iris in Surrey (Kate Winslet) are both having man problems: Amanda's just broken up with her cheating boyfriend, and Iris's sort-of ex has just gotten engaged. They both decide a vacation is in order, and with the help of a house-swapping website, trade houses for two weeks.    The \\"comedy\\" part of \\"romantic comedy\\" comes in when the two women have to adjust to different lifestyles. I've never been to either England or California, but it rang pretty true to me, and didn't seem too exaggerated. The jet lag was definitely a realistic factor.    Amanda's first night at Iris's cottage, there's a knock at the door and she opens it to a very drunk, very good-looking man who turns out to be Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law). She decides a one-night stand with a perfect stranger would be a great way to get over her ex. Graham's drunk, but he's not an idiot, so he obliges. They're both a little more affected than they expected, and they reluctantly start a romance they know has no future.    Iris, meanwhile, answers the door to a couple: Miles (Jack Black), who's a friend of Amanda's ex, and his girlfriend. Iris and Miles get a romance, too, but it moves much more slowly, and is much more complicated. Iris's ex, Jasper, doesn't want to let her go despite the fact that he's marrying another woman--he calls and sends his manuscript for her to proofread, and tells her he can't do without her. The distance is helping, but keeping busy is better, and Iris manages that when she befriends one of Amanda's neighbors, an elderly screenwriter.    Unfortunately, more time was spent on Hollywood's idea of the prettier couple--Diaz and Law--despite the fact that their story was less complex. On the plus side, the movie was over two hours long (138 minutes), so neither story felt too rushed.    Iris and Miles's romance was more believable. They were both dealing with similar break-up issues, and because of the slower pace of their relationship, it was easier to see them becoming drawn to each other and appreciating each other's strengths. Iris's issues were extremely familiar, so that likely had something to do with why I was more drawn to her story.    Amanda and Graham's romance seemed to be more simple chemistry, and while both characters were likable and were dealing with issues that were solved by the relationship (Amanda keeps relationships on the surface, and Graham's got some emotional trauma and responsibility), it wasn't really clear that each was the specific person the other needed in their life.    I do have to say I appreciated the ending. Without spoiling it, I'll say that it was satisfying and hopeful without being too unbelievable.    If I tried, no doubt I could come up with a dozen or more quibbles, but it was such a cheerful movie that I'd rather not.

B00005JMJG|5.0|This DVD was a gift to my daughter, and we watched it with her. She says it's the best movie she's ever seen. I wasn't quite as enthralled as she was, but I enjoyed it very much anyway.<br /><br />When the movie opens, Joel (Jim Carrey) impulsively skips work and goes to the shore, where he meets a blue-haired woman, Clementine (Kate Winslet) and they hit it off. But then strange things start happening.<br /><br />Turns out, Clementine has had boyfriend Joel erased from her mind. When he gets the letter from the memory-erasing clinic informing him of this, he decides to have her erased from his mind as well.<br /><br />The movie jumps back and forward in time, which can be a little disorienting, though I think that was the point. Oddly enough, the story flows well that way, as things learned in one scene impact the meaning of the next regardless of where they fit in the chronology, and the story is much more effective than if it had been told in strict chronological order.<br /><br />I suspect part of the difference between my daughter's \\"best movie ever\\" and my 4.5 stars is that I've read and watched a lot more science fiction than she has, and the concept of erasing memories isn't a new one for me. I did enjoy the details of the technique in this one, though I'd have liked to see it explored a little more thoroughly. For example, much was made of needing to find every single object connected with the person to be erased, but we never saw the consequences of missing something.<br /><br />I was surprised, though, that she liked the romance of the movie--she's usually pretty cynical about such things. I, of course, loved the \\"true love conquers all\\" as well as the twists when things started going wrong.

B000O78KW4|5.0|The director from the first Die Hard is back, as is the concept of the bad guys being super-thieves. Both of which, I think, make this one better than Die Hard 2. The presence of Samuel L. Jackson doesn't hurt, either.    Cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back in New York, but he's suspended from the NYPD and going downhill along with his marriage, when he's called back because some crazy bomber calling himself Simon (Jeremy Irons) has set bombs all over the city and is threatening to blow them all up unless McClane does exactly what Simon Says.    The first thing he's required to do is wear a racist signboard in downtown Harlem. A store owner named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) comes to his aid and ends up getting roped into the game as well.    The games were... mostly... fun, but I had a little trouble believing them--it was an awful lot of effort for the small reward of making McClane run all over the city and keeping the cops focused elsewhere. Seems like the same result could have been achieved by just the bomb in the school.    And speaking of school... I was a little insulted that both McClane and Zeus had trouble with the \\"St. Ives\\" riddle--didn't everyone learn that when they were schoolkids? One of them at least should have recognized it.    And of course, there was the requisite CB (aka \\"crazy bitch\\"), who's pretty much just there for shock value, but since the CB is so awfully common (well, this was 12 years ago, so maybe it wasn't so common then?), the shock value's pretty diminished.    Other than that, though--and those things are easy enough to ignore--it's action-packed, full of twists and turns, and exciting.
B000OPPBEQ|1.0|I purchased three items from this seller and never received my items. I spent over $150 and waited over two weeks for it to arrive. I contacted the seller and never got a response.  I then looked at the reviews and this has happened to many other buyers. Be careful buying form this seller.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|There was a huge amount of controversy in fandom surrounding Daniel Craig as the new James Bond, most of it negative, and mostly centered around his appearance. I've mentioned before that I'm really not a visually-oriented person, so maybe that's why such objections never made any sense to me. It's vastly more important to me that the actor is convincing in the role, and Daniel Craig fit this role in this film very well.    Of course, Casino Royale is a different sort of Bond film from the most recent ones, and substituting Daniel Craig's James Bond for Pierce Brosnan's really wouldn't have worked. Nor would Pierce Brosnan's James Bond have worked in Casino Royale.    As for those who complain that Casino Royale is mucking around with the tradition--yes, this is vastly different from Die Another Day. But this is not the first time the franchise has shifted direction. It's happened pretty much every time there's a new Bond, though it seems to have been a more gradual shift from Moore to Dalton to Brosnan. What makes it more acceptable is that Casino Royale takes place at the very beginning of the Bond mythos, so even if one doesn't view the movies as disparate entities, it's believable that when he first became 007, he was rougher around the edges than he was later.    Casino Royale shows the very beginning of James Bond--how he becomes 007. The start of the film was a dizzying blur, partially in black and white, depicting his earning that 00 status (two kills required--the first one's the hardest). It was brutal and stark, and only the distance created by the film techniques kept it from being too graphic.    There's a requisite busy action scene, with a chase scene that was so long and involved such Jackie-Chan-worthy stunts that I started laughing, earning a glare from my older son. Whoops. No, I wasn't loud. I'm not one of those people.    But then we get to the meat of the movie, with Bond against Le Chiffre, a terrorist financier who's also an inveterate gambler. Bond's mission is to join the high-stakes game and win--or rather, keep Le Chiffre from winning, bankrupting him, and forcing him to accept the government's offer. Enter Vesper Lynd, the treasury agent who comes along to ensure that Bond isn't wasting the government's money.    You can tell it's been a long time since I read the books, because I kept hearing her name as \\"Vespa\\", which made some of the jokes a little nonsensical.    It's not a spoiler to say that Bond falls in love with her and she eventually betrays him--after all, James Bond cannot have a HEA romantic ending, particularly not at this juncture, because we know from earlier films that he's single. Don't try to sort out the timelines--it'll give you a headache, particularly if you try to reconcile Judi Dench's M with Goldeneye.    All in all, an exciting film. A change in direction for the franchise, to be sure, but one that was necessary, I think, to re-energize the series. I'm looking forward to Bond-22, whatever it is.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|While I watched American Idol and thought it was great that a \\"rocker\\" won, I'm not really sure in that contest if it's a good thing.  Once you win, you have to conform to the record label and more times than not, that's not a good thing either.  The record opens up with three pretty catchy tunes, one written by Chris Cornell, but other than that each song is pretty bland and pretty generic.  Listening to Cook on the show and how much he likes to rock, I was really expecting an edge to this album.  It just isn't here, at least for me.  Remember, IMO only because I know there are a lot of 5 star reviews, but I'm not entirely sure if this is just because everyone was glad that the cd came out.  I listen to a lot of music, from rock to alternative to progressive and this album is definitely lacking something.  Maybe, it is because it's his debut on this record label and he has to conform, but I'm hoping his sophomore release delivers more than this did.  The hidden track \\"Kiss on the Neck\\" is fine, but why do I have to wait through approximately 8 minutes of silence to hear it.  And then there's the bonus tracks from various retailer's.  Couldn't they just all be on one cd?  Not like there isn't enough room here to put them on, but then again it's all about getting you to purchase all the various copies to get that one extra track.  Best tracks for me would be \\"Declaration, Heroes, Light On, Life on the Moon, and Bar-ba-Sol.  Other than that, just another generic rock album.  And the closer \\"The Time of My Life\\" I could do without.  While I rate this at 3 stars it might worth just a touch more and if you're going to compare to another Idol contestant who didn't win as in Daughtry, I don't believe there is a comparison although with time most of Daughtry's album rocks.  His cover of \\"Feels Like the First Time\\" is excellent and he would be a fine stand-in for Lou Gramm if Foreigner would ever consider that.  Or, let's compare to the rock album 'Blackbird' by Alterbridge released this year.  Now, that's a five star rock album with no sap thrown in.  The problem with record labels is that they put their artists in a box and don't allow creativity as seen on the indie scene and this is why the indie scene delivers so much more musically.  If you're happy with a middle of the road pop / rock album then this would be for you.  But if you're looking for more as in a touch of FUEL thrown in then this might not be your cup of tea.  Personal tastes, plain and simple.released this year.  Now, that's a five star rock album with no sap thrown in.

076790592X|5.0|This book is amazing.  I can't believe I'm almost 50 years old and not read it yet.  It should have been required reading in High School.  This book has depth and perspective but also it is written with an amazing, easy to grasp style that makes it a classic for almost any age.  I immediately bought two more of Mitch Albom's books plus another written by Morrie Schwartz himself.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants to be gripped by a story about life and happiness, and to be introduced to an author who is in a class by himself.
B00005R23X|3.0|\\"Bram Stoker's....\\" represents the last gasp of Coppola's once-formidable talent. Like \\"Godfather 1 & 2\\", \\"The Conversation\\", and \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (the original release only), this film has personality and style to burn. The difference, and this is nearly fatal, lies in Coppola's casting choices. Clearly Winona Ryder and, especially, Keanu Reeves were chosen to grab a younger audience. That ploy may have worked at the expense of period credibiity and thespian gravitas. I enjoyed Oldman and Hopkins in their scenery-chewing glory, an antidote to the flat readings and performance of Reeves. But, what makes the film remarkable is the production itself: the sets, costumes, score, and old-style \\"in camera\\" low tech effects created by Coppola's boy Roman create an absolutely unique vision. Too bad that Coppola, who once famously fought Paramount for Pacino over Redford, and for Caan and Nino Rota, so easily capitulated to get the film made. If that was the sole way to get Columbia to greenlight the project, then it was worth it. However, the casting and, to a lesser extent James Hart's script, prevented \\"Bram\\" from being a true classic. And yet, after watching \\"The Rainmaker\\" last night, a purely journeyman effort without an ounce of cinematic personality, one longs for another effort as interesting as this \\"Dracula\\"
1400063515|2.0|First of all, I must say I agree with most of Taleb's philosophy. The book shows the deep understanding of the human epistemology and the overlapping fields, and a certainly proper way to see the uncertain. However, everything is over at this point. His philosophical thoughts could be condensed in a fraction of the book, and Taleb could spare us a lot of digressions, pointless cultural references and dull stories. In addition, the writing style is hard to follow, somewhat boring and bombastic, and not necessarily cultured, and it displays a (maybe exaggeratedly) notorious cockiness. Mandelbrot's popular works (being him one of Taleb's heroes) state many of these ideas, proving other people wrong (or going against them), without being so insulting.    The impression I had, while and after reading the book, is that Taleb's intention (or desire), maybe hidden and unconscious, was aimed at writing a compendium of his thoughts, much like the work of all these philosophers he tells us about through the book (Popper, Hayek, Huet, Montaigne...), capitalizing on his previous best-seller and his reputation as a leading quant-finance professional. But he fails, giving too many distant stories and a lack of structure that does not match the depth of his philosophy. The book ends up being a narration, precisely one of the things the author warns us against (a fact already noted in the preface).    In conclusion, a badly conveyed but great philosophy.
B0018CMJSU|3.0|I don't have a HD TV and my television is old so maybe that's why there was nothing in this restored gift set that looked even slightly better than I ever saw before. I'm not complaining, because I'm trusting it will look great once I get an HD TV even if it's on dvd and not Blu-ray.   I find myself buying DVDs for the special features and that was the case here with two DVDs devoted to special features. Coppola's commentary is fantastic and there are some deleted scenes as well as some clever, interesting and then sometimes desperate, \\"I'll use anything,\\" special features.   On the back of the supplements dvd of \\"The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration,\\" it says one of the special features is \\"The making of the GodFather.\\" I don't know how long  I spent going over the special features looking for \\"The making of the Godfather,\\" but it turned out to be a long upsetting night for all involved. I came to realized the main reason I purchased this box set was for this one special feature and it doesn't really exist. There are featurettes  that talk about an aspect of the making, like the music, or \\"filming locations,\\" or if I want to sit in silence squinting to read bio's I might find a trinket of something about the actual shooting, but where is the making of the Godfather? Where are those great screen tests I've seen before of Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert De Niro auditioning? How about the Brando 's home made screen test? Come on Frances what's da matter with you? I paid over fifty bucks here!
0393327345|5.0|What can I say more the typical \\"this is your life and it is ending one minute at a time\\"? I love this kind of narrative style, but what makes the book so special (apart from the mentioned style) is the philosophical message it carries. I was too young when I saw the movie, but when you get a mainstream job, you clearly feel in in your flesh: you are not special. So accept it and let things happen. Obviously, there is no need to follow Tyler's path and set up a fight club. People just need to focus and follow their own nature. Discard whatever that makes you pain, retain whatever that makes you happy, and that's the whole message.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I've been meaning to see this 2007 award-winning film for a long time.  I'm glad I finally did.<br /><br />This is a comedy but it is more than that.  It is a heartwarming story of an off-beat and lovable 16-year old girl who becomes pregnant.  She is exceptionally wise and savvy with one of the most lovable personalities I have ever seen on the scene.  Ellen Page is cast in this role and is absolutely perfect for the part.  I don't think any other actor could have done as well.  I applaud her performance and want to just keep applauding.<br /><br />The screenplay is wonderful too and a great vehicle to showcase her acting.  It is heartwarming and not maudlin as we share her experiences with her understanding family and the prospective adoptive parents who she interviews and bonds with.  There is also good upbeat music throughout which supports the theme of the story.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few bumps along the way.  Her boyfriend invites a different girl to the prom.  The prospective adoptive father becomes enamored with Juno romantically.  She has to deal with her own bulging body and the stares of her classmates.  And there are times that her situation seems too much of a burden for her.<br /><br />This is a really fine film and I highly recommend it for everyone.  Enjoy!

0307237702|5.0|An Enlightening insight into our new president.  Agree or disagree, the throngs who claimed during his campaign that he offered no specifics simply needed to crack a book.<br /><br />Showcasing his unusual ability to fairly and accurately include other opinions in defining his own, Obama's comprehention of contrary philosophies shines forth in a distinguished and diplomatic prose.<br /><br />Well grounded in common sense, candor and hard work, Mr. Obama brings us into his world and his thought processes.  One comes away with the distict feeling that even if you don't agree with the author's conclusion, you can trust his reasonable and measured approach to problem solving to rule the day.<br /><br />I find it a rare privilege to have such a window to a newly elected president.  No other sitting president duing my adult life had ever authored a book.  Obama not only wrote this alone, he gave us his very policies, in advance.  The availability of such a text should not be taken lightly.

1400063515|5.0|Enlightening book.  Nassim Taleb has questioned at length the (empirical and philosophical) foundations of our public thinking. He operates from high ground as he foretold our current global economic story. To illustrate: Imagine an aspiring politician who predicts that her policies will create one million jobs, or the incumbent politician who reads his tea leaves and announces that his policies have created two million new jobs.  You, like me, have probably wondered:  \\"In such a big and complicated world, how do they know the impact of their actions, and more generally the future, with such singular clarity and absolute certainty?\\"  Taleb describes in detail why their (and our) confidence is not justified and he points us beyond the chatter of our society's big talkers\\" and toward the minds of Benoit Mandelbrot, Karl Raimond Popper, and Fredrieck Hayak'(while are providing reasons to be skeptical of Carl Freidrick Gauss and the bell curve). Taleb connects their ideas to the hard realities we face today. This book is ultimately an essay about mathematical empiricism, philosophy, reason, risk, uncertainty, and real life.  But what makes it a great read is that Taleb actually takes the time to \\"dis\\" entire professions (if not individual professionals and public figures) on the solid grounds of intellectual merit.  There's not enough of that in this world. His willingess to do it makes the book even more interesting and harder to ignore.
B001DHXT20|4.0|Like Batman, this Hulk is a basic \\"redo\\" of the franchise. I liked the 1st Hulk movie... its greatest crime was not enough CG, too much focus on real people. Well, this version remedies that problem.  The final confrontation was possibly the best CG free for all battle I have ever seen. Without spoiling anything, let us just say the military got a big surprise in their conflict. I liked the movie enough to run out and buy it.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Disney's classic fairy tale SLEEPING BEAUTY is timeless.  It is as lovely today as it was in 1959.  Full of warmth, saturated colors, and an enduring story, SLEEPING BEUATY continues to enchant princesses of all ages.<br /><br />We purchased this DVD for my three year old as a Christmas gift, but could not resist a sneak peak at Grandma and PawPaw's house over Thanksgiving.  The animation was stellar in 1959, and I must say, it certainly holds its own against any animation of today.  The vibrancy, detail, and charm still capture the imagination, submerging the viewer the fairy tale world.  The story itself is eternal:  good triumphs over evil and love, true love, concurs all.  The music is a perfect accompaniment to the tale, and \\"Once Upon A Dream\\" ranks up there as one of the all time best Disney songs.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed watching this with my two girls and the rest of my family.  It was a beautiful way for the entire family to spend a small part of Thanksgiving week doing something memorable together.  I was surprised about how much of this movie I did not remember from when I saw it 40 years ago, and I was surprised how much detail my 11 year old remembered from the first time she saw it.  The three year old was simply enchanted by the entire movie; from the fairies to Princess Aurora.  She was enraptured the magic and the majesty of the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this dvd as a treat for the entire family.  Little ones, teens, parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles will all have a wonderful time together.  It will make your time together a little happier and a little brighter.  And that is what memories are all about.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This BBC 5-disc, 14-episode series blew me away!<br /><br />OK, what makes this series any different than the myriad of other nature shows out there?<br /><br />1) Planet Earth filming crews made it a point to visit remote places that are seldom visited<br />2) They made it a point to locate and film many endangered species that have seldom if ever been filmed in the wild<br />3) The film crews were not satisfied to only film these animals, they succeeded in filming many seldom-observed behaviors of those endangered species<br />4) The film crews included not only footage of the animals they sought, but incredible footage showing the habitats those species rely on for survival.<br />5) The \\"how-they-did-it\\" video short features accompanying the episodes were fantastic.<br /><br />From all indications the BBC did not cut any corners or leave any filming techniques unexplored in order to compile video footage and then produce this masterpiece.<br /><br />When our copy of \\"Planet Earth\\" arrived we decided as a family to watch one episode a week.  After only the first episode the entire crew wanted to watch more, but we decided to stick with our original plan.  We set aside a designated time each week to watch an episode and no one missed any of those showings.  That's incredible considering the fact that we have a HS senior, a HS junior, a HS freshman, and a 4th grader.<br /><br />The episodes satisfied and intrigued children, teens, and adults alike.  We were sad when we reached the final episode, but we all agree that it was a highly enriching experience.<br /><br />If you are looking for intelligent, meaningful, and well-done programming to add to your personal video collection, look no further.  Planet Earth is a MUST HAVE item.<br /><br />Nature video experiences just don't get any better than this!  And, I should know - I've been teaching biology, zoology, and environmental science at the college/university level for over 15 years.<br /><br />5 stars all the way!  And this is not just any 5 stars - a solid, A+ 100% 5-star rating!And this is not just any 5 stars - a solid, A+ 100% 5-star rating!

B001KQIAXM|5.0|I'll be completely honest, when I first heard there was going to be a 2 disc album one for Beyonce and one for Sasha (Fierce).  I was extremely skeptical, I mean how can any artist showcase their alter ego, but somehow Beyonce pulled it off brilliantly. I am... or Disc one is the more down to earth Beyonce that shows off a different side we have yet to hear thus far, this one is more for the listeners that want to hear the ballads to mid tempos. while Sasha Fierce allowed B to be more edgy and street than we have heard before.  To me with this album she appeased every fan, and I absolutely love it.
B00129H7VS|5.0|blu-ray case is noticeably smaller than dvd case. thin metal case without any sharp edges. when case is opened and inside is pulled, all discs are attached to one long roll except for the last (6th disc), which is stationary to the bottom of the case. the last disc is the special features disc, which not all the contents are in 1080p resolution, rather, some segments in the special features are in 480 resolution.     from the beginning to end, there will be parts of the film where there are heavy grains in the picture, especially during intense \\"in your face\\" action sequences. the grains are intentional to keep the mood of the time period and the gritty documentary feel. 2 parts per disc with total of 10 parts equals 5 discs + special features 6th disc. each disc features picture in picture commentary from the original surviving members of EASY COMPANY as well as a neat feature called \\"interative field guide\\". the IFG is simply a feature where there is a time table line on the bottom of the screen and moves along with the movie to give an in-depth educational points of interest to let YOU the viewer choose an icon and educate yourself on anything from army ranks to old WWII film clips. very intuitive and intelligent feature. kudos to HBO.

B001GQO50I|1.0|What many reviewers are complaining about regarding the sound quality is true. For this CD the sound quality is okay at best, and at times pretty bad.     Excellent sounding master tapes of The Matix concerts exist, but they were not used on this CD.     It is heartbreaking to hear clips of the original master tapes, the sound for those are incredibly good.

1416594884|1.0|This seemed to be a well written book but certainly fell apart at the end. Did the author think we had never heard about renditions? Was I supposed to be shocked at the \\"American\\" behavior? I can't help it if Bush was somehow given the election for president twice and then ran roughshod all over everyones rights. Other than that, what was the point of the book? Nothing that I could see. Virtually everything about the plot and subplots were left unresolved.   A real stinker.
1433502402|5.0|This is a great edition. ESV is my favorite translation. Although I don't agree with everything that is stated in the notes and introductions, I respect how it is stated without bias.

This edition makes reading the Bible a great experience. (not that it wasn't great before)  :)
B001GQACGO|5.0|If you are a fan of Beyonce's voice, you will love I am Beyonce.  If you have seen Sasha Fierce in Concert, you will love I am Sasha Fierce.  If you are a fan period, YOU WILL LOVE THIS ALBUM.  She has expressed herself by revealing her more mature side, yet keeping it dance driven for her true fans that love to see her be the ultimate performer (as she alwasys does in concert).  I am not sure why anyone would actually come on here and make a negative comment about buying the album when the entire thing is on the internet??  If you didn't like what you heard online, why would you spend the money to buy it... just to come on here and say it's garbage?  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but having one just for the sake of saying something negative is so 2008, only 1 more month, then it is out of style for good....
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I just saw this film and i am speechless, i have literally no words to describe this movie.<br />Its unlike anything i have ever seen and with unbelievable performances by Heath Ledger as the Joker (The Glasgow Smile was a fantastic touch to the evil) and surprisingly Aaron Eckhart as Harvey two-face.<br />In my opnion, the key in this film was the editing, it was just too good with the scene sequences and flow being there and clear.<br />The double-triple-quadruple climatic/anti-climatic/ anti-anti-climatic plot and script was really the best.<br />I think this is Chris Nolan's Taj Mahal.<br />I hope it makes it to the AFI's list of top 10 movies of all time.<br /><br />For Heath Ledger: Rest in peace, you gave us a great great gift with your performance, beyond cool, just beyond.....
B0013FSL3E|4.0|This movie is absolutely amazing! I went to see this movie in theaters with a few friends and my girlfriend. I wasn't too fond of seeing this movie, and was already bashing it as we were walking into the theater. This movie shut me up! Pixar had my undivided attention throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />As for the DVD, however... I bought it off of Amazon; and didn't expect to receive a cardboard sleeve type of box. The Dvd doesn't click into place in the box; instead, it just rests in place. This really worries me because I feel like it moves around in the case and gets scratched easier. I would definitely prefer a traditional plastic case for this movie.<br /><br />Movie: 5 Stars<br />DVD:  4 Stars

B001GQACGO|2.0|I liked Beyonce before, when there were 4 members of DC, then when there were 3, and then her two solo albums. I Am... Sasha Fierce is not up to par.   Her junior album falls far short of the hype and expectations. I see what she was trying to do and I appreciate it, but her voice was wasted on those attempts at crossover songs on the first disc. There were maybe 2 non failures on it, so it wasnt all bad. I do have to say Ave Maria.... really B? Really?    Disc 2 Sasha Fierce, better, still not great, but better. My 2 qualms are that Diva and Video Phone are like 2 remixes of A Millie.. and Im A Millied out. This album has its moments, but are very few and far between.

1595141979|5.0|...but even more, importantly, I had to finish this book, the latest installment in the Vampire Academy world.<br /><br />Excellent. First word to last. As usual.<br /><br />I'm already on the list to buy to buy the next one, as yet Untitled.<br /><br />If you're not already hooked into this series, this author, by all means GO. Buy. Read. Definitely including this, the third book in the series, they'll all be well worth your time.<br /><br />Skillful writing. Tight plotting. Excellent characterizations. Multi-layered motivations. The events in this book are carried forward by some really *good* writing of the very finest escapist-fiction variety. The usually so-obvious and solid line between good and bad takes a bit of a hit, too, here in the third Vampire Academy book.<br /><br />This is a remarkable book in an extraordinary vampire fantasy series, a type of book which has, since the publication of LKH's 'Guilty Pleasures', become a _vastly_ overcrowded genre.<br /><br />This book (and the series from whence it comes) adds another sparkling, sizzling book to the magic of the genre we call 'vampire fantasy' or 'vampire romance' or 'dark fantasy' or 'urban fantasy' or urban dark fantasy'. (Please insert whatever combination of adjectives you like best ['dark vampire romance urban magic blood bond fantasy'] in the appropriate place in the previous sentence.)  Bottom line: This is a wonderful read, and the field needs more wildly imaginative and painstakingly perfectionist writers like Mead.
0739308742|3.0|I really enjoy the series George R.R. Martin creates a twisting tale of deception, that keeps you reading, or in this case listening. The previous three books had Roy Dotrice as the Narrator, and he did an extremely good job, with different voices for each character. For some reason however, Martin used a new Narrator for this book, John Lee. The pronunciation of words sometimes is a bit overdone, and almost all of the characters are indistinguishable from each other.   Why fix something that is not broken Mr. Martin?

B001GQO50I|1.0|I'm a monster Doors fan. I've bought just about everything they've ever released and never regretted it.  I bought  The Matrix show 'cause I've had the bootlegs for years, loved the performances and looked forward to this official release.  I realize now that I was swept up in the hype of press releases.  The Doors should have purchased the original master tapes from Peter Abram and released the shows as good as they can sound and as complete as they could be.  I've heard clips from the masters and they clearly sound better.  Disappointing. At least they could have given the guy who originally recorded the shows an honorable mention in the liner notes, no?  People Are Strange indeed.    I hope that somehow, someway, these shows will still see a proper release.

B000N3ST7A|3.0|Stevie Nicks deserves a better compilation than this.  Most of the live songs (\\"Edge of 17,\\" \\"Landslide,\\" \\"Rock and Roll\\") are inferior compared to the original versions.  It's nice to hear the live version of \\"Rhiannon,\\" but Stevie's performance from Fleetwood Mac's \\"The Dance\\" was better than the performance selected here.  So, these live versions ultimately take up space that could have been occupied by actual hits (\\"After the glitter fades,\\" \\"Nightbird,\\" \\"Needles and Pins,\\" \\"Sometimes it's a Bitch,\\" \\"Has anyone ever written anything for you,\\" etc.).  It would have been nice to have other Fleetwood Mac songs too (\\"Sara,\\" \\"Gypsy,\\" \\"Gold dust woman,\\" to name a few).  So, this compilation ultimately misses the mark despite being a decent listen.  Fans wanting her best songs and hits should probably stick to \\"Timespace\\" and \\"Fleetood Mac's Greatest Hits.\\"

Songs like Sour Girl, Down, S*x and Violence, and my personal fave Atlanta are excellent tracks but the rest of the album is pretty much filler.

Um ok...my only complaint about the book was that it was predictable and there wasn't a single \\"plot twist\\" that you couldn't see coming a mile away (i.e. pregnancy, jacob imprinting on said child even before she was born, the volturi NOT fighting...ALL of it was incredibly predictable, but it's literature for teenagers so predictability can be forgiven)...anywho my point is, I firmly believe BD stayed true to the story while at the same time resolving itself.
B001EO2UJK|4.0|Music: 5 stars, DVD extras: 4 stars<br /><br />I bought the \\"Genesis 1976-1982\\" box set last year, and couldn't have been happier with what I got. I passed on the \\"1983-1997\\" box set but was eagerly looking forward to the third and last box set, covering the earliest years of the band.<br /><br />\\"Genesis 1970-1975\\" (7 cds, 6 dvds) brings the first 5 albums of the band's catalogue, plus one CD of various outtakes. I'm not going to discuss the merits (musical or otherwise) of the 5 studio albums here, but will instead focus on the extras found on the DVDs and the extra CD. The DVD extras vary greatly. On both \\"Trespass\\" and \\" Nursery Crymes\\" the extras are limited to the 2007-taped reissue conversations (I guess no usable video of live shoes are available). The conversations on all of the DVDs are markedly longer than on the 1976-1982 set, in the 40-45 min. range, not that that is a bad thing. It's great to see Peter Gabriel reflect on all these albums. Anthony Phillips makes a nice appearance on the \\"Trespass\\" conversations (explaining he left the band due to stage fright). Things get a lot more interesting on the \\"Foxtrot\\" DVD extras, with excellent footage (about 60 min.) from a 1972 Belgian TV show, clearly taped live. Fascinating to watch the band in this early stage. The \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" DVD extras brings excellent footage from a 1973 TV show (mostly Foxtrot-era songs) and a 1973 French show. The most disappointing extras come from on the \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" DVD. Frankly I had hoped for a video recording of the entire album, I mean, they toured this album extensively, playing it over 100 times. Didn't any of these shows get taped on video? Instead, we get footage of a 1974 French TV show, not bad, but with only pre-Lamb songs. I like \\"Supper's Ready\\" as much as anyone, but it shows up three times in its entirety in the various DVD extras... As to the extra CD (10 tracks, 46 min.), it is quite nice with songs like \\"Happy the Man\\", a post-Nursery Cryme single, and \\"Twilight Alehouse\\", a Trespass-era song. There are a number of other Trespass-era songs as well that didn't make the album.<br /><br />In all, there is much to love with this box set. The albums are of course fantastic. The sound quality of the albums on the DVDs is outstanding if you have the right home theatre setting (which I happen to have).

B000S9HVZU|4.0|Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) was a lyrical but highly experimental writer whose novels frequently deal in both the endless details and transitory nature of life, shifting back and forth in time, and frequently employing a style that is commonly known as \\"stream of conciousness.\\" With THE HOURS, writer Michael Cunningham referrences Woolf's concerns and style while interweaving the stories of three women: Virginia Woolf herself in the 1920s, as she begins to write the novel MRS. DALLOWAY; Laura Brown in the late 1940s, who reads MRS. DALLOWAY while struggling against the confines of a middle-class marriage; and Clarissa Vaughn, a book editor who is known to an old friend as \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and who spends of her day in activities that reflect Virginia Woolf's MRS. DALLOWAY.<br /><br />The novel is essentially a series of \\"literary conceits,\\" concepts and ideas which constantly reference and imitate the original MRS. DALLOWAY without actually copying the novel itself. Cunningham strives to capture Woolf's tone of voice without exactly copying her style, and is largely successful; the three stories are interesting in and of themselves and they ultimately merge in a surprising manner; and the entire thing is written with tremendous style and grace. It is also a fairly easy read, a novel which can be consumed over the course of a day or two.<br /><br />But for all its charms, there is no getting around the fact that THE HOURS is fundamentally gimmicky, and the gimmicky quality of the book is actually emphasized by whatever knowledge the reader may have about Woolf and her novel MRS. DALLOWAY. In consequence the whole thing feels a little affected and a little sterile, too much of a literary game, too little of an organic whole. I certainly enjoyed reading it--once. But it is not a work to which I believe I will return in the future, for it gives up all its secrets in a single reading.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
1433502410|5.0|First look: As good as I imagined    Here are my first thoughts after opening my splendid, inspired little treasure:    PRINT VERSION    The pages are of the finest quality, super thin paper.  Or as the Hebrews would say, thin-thin. Called Primalux and made in France, it is like gossamer, like a zephyr, so handle gently, slowly, and lovingly.  My advice is simply to set your printed copy aside for occasional use, because the online version is what this book is all about. I'm not kidding.    The text is very readable, even with significantly more white space between lines than I would have expected.  My suspicion is that the length of the book (2,752 pages) is due to a generous amount of white space.  The is extremely smart of Crossway.  If you can't read a book, you can't use it.  It's that simple.  You will use this book.  The spine is smyth-sewn (pronounced like blithe), and the book opens beautifully.    It's big, but it's not a Strong's Concordance.  Don't worry; I doubt you'll be trucking it around, unless you are a preacher, teacher, or show-off (yeah, you, show-off! :-)).    ONLINE VERSION    The online activiation code is in the brochure in the back of your book.  It's a bit hard to scratch off, but be careful you don't scratch too hard -- you might scratch the page and remove the text altogether.  As I said previously, the cross-referencing is amazing.    The notes are very apt and easy to access while reading.  The articles are so well written.  They are not like the dusty study Bible essays of old; they are written for a modern reader with a modern lifestyle (fast-paced and no time to waste).  The sheer amount of the extra-Biblical material is absolutely staggering.  And I fully expect new online features to be added for all of us to enjoy as the years progress (can you imagine a book this large where you can fix typos and translation errors without going to press?).    At first glance, it appears -- thankfully -- that the publishers are very careful about not making emphatic statements when the scholarship on a subject is varied or not in agreement.
0671027344|5.0|My younger sister bought this book and then after gave it to me-and it is one of those books that I will pick up and read again and again.  It is so beautifully written and continues to leave the reader with a new outlook each time it is read.  I am in college now and have passed this book along to others to be read and every one of them has loved it so far.  It is by far one of the best books I have ever read, hands down.  I would recommend it for everyone to read!

B000AARKOO|5.0|Happily, I did not see this firm when it was first released, and was unaffected by a butchred commercial version.  But then, except for STAR WARS, which I saw the day it opened at the Paramount, New York, I make it a point to avoid first release showings on most films.  Here, my caution was rewarded and I was able to enjoy a rare experience undiluted and at my leisure.  This is, as most reviews see it, a very good, very  unusual film; something one expects from Ridley Scott.  Myself, I say that's only the beginning, and for more than a month I've been racking my brains to remember when I've seen anything as magnificent and as cinematically successful.    The viewing time?  Too long?  Not for me.  I'm a confirmed Wagnerite, and my motto is \\"If its good, don't stop.\\"    The cinematography?  Absolutely on the highest level.  If many of those battlefield shots were blown up and presented like Matthew Brady's photographs of the killing fields of our Civil War, they would be hailed, heartily praised as exmples of the very best kind of that photography.  In color and sweep and with the cast dressed -- so incredibly well -- in the armor of the medieval Islamic period, one has the impression of watching vast Delacroix historical paintings come to life.  The photography is very often breath-taking.  Affictionadoes of war or, call them ancient or antiwue battle movies with swords and spears and horses, will will be able to examine closely and to enjoy one panorama after anotehr from very long shots showing position and movement of troops over terrain, to mid-shots of charges -- a couple plainly in homage to Olivier's brilliant charge of the Knights at Agincourt -- and close-ups of the carnage where one almost cringes for fear of being spattered with mud and blood.     The sets are sublime, and there are so many of them and of such wide variety, both inerior and exterior, and of widely differin scale, one's mind is overwhelmed.  To imagine the city of Jerusalem a century afterthe firsr Crusade, and then to present it in a numer of ariel views and in different kinds of light, is a feat of successfully convincing visualizaion unknown to me.  Though I have seen photographs of the Crusader castles in Palestine, their architectural character has never been so clear.  And neither has he city itself.  City of Abraham, prince of Chaldea, this is one of  only a very few cities that deserve to be called Holy,      What about religion?  Well, both the Director and Scenarist are diffident about it, to say the least, for though it would be ridiculous to create an historical film about Crusading knights in and around Jerusalem without engaging in some way in the discussion or the depection of occult traditions (as well as disguised motivations) that swirl about everyone in the story, from the lowest to the highest, my personal impression is that although the film story is intensely concerned with personal morality and faith, it is accutely anti-clerical.  In symbol it appears to this reviewer to be aseries of contrasts between characters symbolizing  Roman Catholic practice and other characters symbolizing Potestant Chrisian practice.  The Kingdom of Jerusalem is several times called a Nation of Conscience -- which might fit in with what Luther had in mind when he thought and wrote about the christian practice of faith -- bur it stands in stark contrast with the words and the inetntions of Innocent III, who intended that all humankind should be ruled by the Papacy, once conquered by the hordes of semi-barbarous marauders he sent East.  But one must resist the urge to be sucked into chuch history.  Nevertheless, it would probably be fair to say that the film is as profoundly spiritual and sincere as it is anti-religious, or heritical.      Did I mention that it is utterly engrossing?  It is.  Ane here one ought to think about sound.  This master director knows how to utilize and synthesize both found sound, sound effects, and music with the spoken wordin such a way that the ear is constantly refreshed, and the mind always stimulated -- both by what one hears and what one almost hears or thinks one hears.  Or even what one might heave heard.  Its a kind of auditory confusion few directors can work well, but which he understands and uses like a virtuoso.  For example:  Immediately after I finished the movie I realized there were parts of it, details, that I didn't understand, and thinking I hadn't heard them, I was prompted to watch the film again (weeks later) with the volume adjusted and sitting closer to he speakers..  After the next viewing I realized I hadn't missed much at all; that rather, I'd been tricked.  This is how: when a dull person wants to get your attention, he shouts at you.  When an intelligent one wants your attention, he lowers his voice, forcing you to pay closer attention to what he has to say.  The wrier had given to the director a script allowing the director to tell the story mostly with pictures, which is what a good director does.  One doesn't go to the movies to listen to movies.  That's what Radio shows were for.  By using the camera skillfully to show the performers in shifting angles as they move through the scenery not always talking, the director is able to give us more and better information than he could were he only to film conversations.    ORLANDO BLOOM:  This actor is well cast in this story.  He is different from the othr males that surround him; not only is he younger and though physically fit and muscular, he is somewhat smaller than they are.  But, within the story it is established that he is yes, a blacksmith, (as well as a silversmith) but a man who can design and oversee the  building of a new cathedral; he has already established hmself as one who builds fortifications and siege mchinery.  Later, in Jerusalem, he demonstrates his unusual abilities by designing and constructing an irrigation system based on a knowledge of hydraulics.  The young man is obviously a genius.  So, it is not surprising that he designs and captains the defense of he city against he formidable might of Saladin.  In addition, and preeminently, he has inernalized the knight's code -- which includes the command to \\"protect the weak\\" -- and become a practicing christian.  Bloom plays a \\"perfect Knight\\", both an ideal and an idealized figure, and distinguishes himself as a Parcifal or Sir Percival of Arthurian legend.  In every aspect, therefore, the choice of yet anoher heroic fighter, like Russell Crowe, or any other actor of the muscle-guy type, woulld have been wrong.  The characte Bloom plays is formidably a warrior who fights with his mind and soul, and character.  Orlando Bloom's masculine beauty dramatizes the differences between his character and those of the other men who have been hardened and coarsened by intrigue, battle and murder.    The cast is wonderful; all very, very interesting-looking, and talented.  Whoever cast the movie accepted quite a challenge, for most of the actors' faces are interesting and have something to tell us about the story, from the stars to the extras.  The faces of the Muslims were thrilling in their variety and beauty.  It is daunting enough to imagine Saladin, but to imagine his sister is even more so.  Both hero and heoine are beautiful and beautifully matched.  One could go on and on about hem, but why?  You have eyes.    In short, the film is in every respect an embarassment of riches.  Most of us have seen and enjoyed his other films, and have begun to see what that peculiar gift is that he possesses which runs through all of them.   His primary concerns appear to be about men; that is, about duty, strength of character, loyalty and personal inegrity.  To my mind KINGDOM OF HEAVEN may well be Ridley Scott's ultimate masterpiece.  His identifying mark or motto is something like \\"A Scott Free Production,\\" which leads me to think he may have produced it, (or raised the money for the film) himself.  If so, it musthave been a staggering sum.  But, the difference here is that in KINGDOM, every farthing of the multiples of millions of dollars and/or pounds is clearly visible.  He made them all work double or tripple duty, and the result is all for our benefit.    Stop!  It just dawned on me as I submited this review, that if you want to get an idea of how really and truly amazing this movie is, you should find a copy of De Mille's THE CRUSADES, and watch  them in sequence.  Your choice.

0316067601|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" is a terrific tale of terrible hardship, fear, heroism and a refusal to give up, physically or morally.  We are given a front row seat as to SEAL training and indoctrination and, then, we see these things in action against incredible odds.  The reader comes to realize that SEAL training is not so much about physical hardening--as a matter of fact, much of SEAL training probably weakens hard bodies--as it is about finding those very few men who will seldom, if ever, give up when in impossible situations.<br /><br />This is basically what we see in the combat phase of this story.  Four SEALs are assaulted by 200 or more Taliban on steep, virtually impossible terrain.  The Taliban aren't wimps.  They are dedicated Jihadists willing to take casualties.  Take casualties they do but during the course of a confused, hours long, verticle battle, they succeed in killing three of the SEAL team and badly injuring and shooting up the fourth [Luttrell].  Miraculously Lutrrell survives by throwing himself multiple times down clifflike hillsides and, even more miraculously, always comes up with his rifle, managing to kill and wound more of the enemy.<br /><br />Broken, battered and wounded Luttrell is finished to be resuced by friendly Afghans who decide to give him the blood-oath sanctuary of their protection.  The Taliban nevertheless try to take him away and execute him but the tribal chieftain will have none of it.  He not only protects Luttrell but the old man singlehandedly walks to a U.S. base and tells them of Luttrell's presence.  Luttrell is rescued but we wonder about the fate of his rescuers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cost of an earlier resuce attempt is a helicopter, full of elite troops, downed with the loss of all hands.  Only one criticism I can level at the story.  The detail is, perhaps, a little too good.  The vast majority of individuals going through a Luttrell-type experience would simply block part of it.  The pain, fear, disorientation and shock while falling and wounded tend to play hovoc with memory...but...perhaps SEALS, by nature and training, remember...<br /><br />Incidentally, I quite agree with Luttrell about the miserable and biased U.S. press.  I also agree that our 'rules of engagement', generally speaking, are articles for defeat.  I also disapprove of sending military attorneys [political commissars] into combat situations to approve or disapprove of the legal 'correctness' of a military action.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexicond wounded tend to play hovoc with memory...but...perhaps SEALS, by nature and training, remember...

B001ACH4DS|4.0|When I first got this cd I was not impressed. I made myself give it a chance though, and it has quickly grown on me. For me there are two ways to rate this album:    1) vs. Analog Heart - I really enjoyed Analog Heart and think that Analog Heart is a better album.  2) vs. Chris Daughtry - It may be a little unfair but given their American Idol background and style I think you have to do this comparison. I will give Round 1 to Chris Daughtry. What Daughtry excelled at was making music that had a high marketability factor, which I think is reflected by the high amount of air time that his songs got. Although David Cook's album is good there aren't really any catchy songs that could get into the mainstream and pull some non fans onto his side (I think this can be seen by how quick his debut song has dropped on the charts)    Overall I am happy with this CD. I will admit that my expectations were very high and don't think they were quite met. If you are already a fan of David Cook then I would definitely recommend. If you are on the fence I would still say give it a listen. If you can though, try to get your hands on a copy of Analog Heart which is excellent (this album puts into question how David Cook can be considered an amateur by American Idol standards, but that is for a different debate)
0060899220|5.0|Kitchen Confidential is a must read for anyone who has ever set foot in the backrooms of a restaurant.  Bourdain captures the environment with all its stresses, off-colored language and cooking pride.  Kitchen Confidential reads similar to a feature on VH1's Behind the Music as Bourdain battles with his own demons and finds success after many years of debauchery.  I have been a fan of Bourdain's No Reservation on the Travel Channel for quite awhile and now as an author.  The book lead me to another Bourdain project called the Les Halles Cookbook which has inspired me to spend more time in the favorite room of my house, the kitchen.  Thank you, Tony!

It's not that she sounds bad but the camera angles (on top of the music) wasn't where it could have been. It may have been better to not keep the camera on her so much... she seemed nervous. I appreciate the occasional audience clip but that wasn't there. The direction could have been much better.

0525457585|5.0|Like many people, I first knew about The Neverending Story through the movie. At first, I didn't even know about the book. Then I didn't really care. After all, how many of you actually care to read the book of every movie you might have seen?<br /><br />But lately out of a bit of nostalgia, I went back through my video library and watched the first and second movie. Still craving more, I decided to bite the bullet and order this book. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />As I'm sure you've read from other reviews, the first movie barely covers half of the book. Even then, at the end of the movie it started to stray way off of what the book had. The second movie just borrowed a few characters and one or two of the plot devices and went its own way. As much as I may love the movies, they pale in comparison to what is in the book. The book is richer and a lot deeper than the movies. There are key concepts and morals that never made their way into the films, too many to go into in this review. But over all, the first movie seemed to try to just get the story that was in the book while missing the whole point of why the story is important in the first place. The second movie didn't even bother to do that much. If you like the movies you really owe it to yourself to read this book.<br /><br />I would also suggest getting this hardback version. I've seen the paperback at a local bookstore. The cover is nowhere near as pretty. It's missing all of the beautifully drawn illustrations that this one has. Above all, the duo-colored lettering adds so much to the reading. Michael Ende does a lot of clever little things that help draw the reader into experiencing this book more than simply reading it. A lot of what he does includes the lettering and the many illustrations that are found in this book. It's worth getting the hard cover version just for the way it deepens the experience. You won't regret it.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I loved David's Analog Heart (purchased here before being pulled) and what I was quite pleasantly surprised with was how my 'favorite' changed (and still does) with time.  I've NOT been a CD buyer because, like alot of us, I got tired of paying $16 for one or two songs I like.  Not.  Analog Heart is a staple on my Zen player.    Again, I am pleasantly surprised.  I know there are lots of fans that thought \\"Light On\\" was great.  I wasn't all that impressed with it...at first.  Like some of the tracks on Analog Heart, tracks on David Cook grow on me with each listening. First favorite...Lie.  I love this song.  Declaration, A Daily Anthem, Avalanche, Bar-Ba-Sol...dug them at first listen...the rest?  Growing on me in the same way everything on Analog Heart did.  This album joins Analog Heart as another staple on my Zen player.

0792843584|4.0|After having absorbed the originally released extended director's cut for years (the 2-vhs set), I was disappointed to see two crucial omissions from this version. One, the incredible roller-skating sequence is presented here in color, matching the basic tone of the rest of the film (mind you, nothing wrong with that). My original print shows that same sequence in a deep, rich sepia-tone tint. It never failed to give me chills every time I experienced it, and I couldn't believe this print did not have it. Also (and even more head-scratching) is the fact that there are no English sub-titles! Most of the speeches in the heaven's gate hall toward the end are in a Eastern European dialect and you miss what's being said.  Also, please note that this is not a true 16:9 wide-screen dvd. It's presented in that format within a standard 4:3. So you have to zoom in to fill your wide-screen monitor, and from what I could discern, the print is not all that consistently focused.  I guess I'll have to wait until a better version shows up someday, maybe a double-disc with commentary!

B0013FSL3E|4.0|I'm not much of one for animated movies; not sure why.  The only other Pixar offering I've seen in its entirety was \\"Toy Story\\" (I enjoyed it, of course).  But something attracted me to \\"Wall-E,\\" something about the simplicity of the story: A robot, stranded on an abandoned and (mostly) lifeless Earth, who develops human emotions.  Then, when another robot (EVE) comes in search of life, WALL-E falls in love, and eventually has to go on a quest to \\"rescue\\"  EVE from a city-sized spaceship run by maniacal machines and inhabited by overweight, oafish humans.<br /><br />Well, in that context, \\"WALL-E\\" doesn't sound so simple after all.  And, truthfully, it isn't.  There's the delightful story, brought to life by vivid animation and \\"vocal\\" work; WALL-E is perhaps the most \\"human\\" animated character I've ever encountered (God, that's a cliche if I've ever heard one, but it's true).  This little robot says very little, but you are absolutely enamored with him.<br /><br />Then there's the subtext.  It's not very subtle, of course: It's right there in your face, with grotesquely overweight humans who can't even walk anymore, driving around obvlivious to the beauty that surrounds them.  It's in the billboards advertising Buy 'N Large, the company that first took over the world, dumped all its trash into orbit, then had to leave the planet when the environment became too inhospitable.  This is an anti-consumerism movie at its grimmest, much in the vein of the old Disney cartoons (which were often based on Anderson's fairy tales, but had a lot of Brothers Grimm in them, as well).<br /><br />The thing is...this movie is hopeful.  That is perhaps its ultimate triumph: Not only does the film make you fall head over heels for what is essentially a sentient trashcan, it planets a seed of hope in you, a ray of light amongst the trash-strewn world the film inhabits.  \\"I don't want to survive,\\" says a character, just realizing who he is.  \\"I want to live!\\"  And you will, too: \\"WALL-E\\" is hopeful, powerful stuff.  It's also hilarious, heart-warming, and beautifully animated.  Watch it for the message; watch it because it's a good movie.  Either way, you're going to be entertained.stuff.

0765316897|5.0|The Hero of Ages is a very well written and satisfying end to this great trilogy by Brandon Sanderson. As in the first two books, \\"The Final Empire\\" and \\"The Well of Ascension\\", Sanderson does a great job telling the story through his characters. Each and everyone of his main characters seem very real and life like with all of their strengths and weaknesses. Also, Sanderson continues with plot twists that very few will see coming, as well as a shocker of an ending. But the climax and ending of this book fits in very well with the books' themes. If you have not read any of Sanderson's books, and you enjoy epic fantasy; then I recommend the Mistborn Trilogy with a Five Star rating and my highest possible recommendation. I promise you that you won't be disappointed.

B000063DHK|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Maiden, in fact they're my favorite band of all time and I own all the albums, DVDs, Live albums, and have seen them live in Concert, which was the single greatest experience in my life. I will never forget June 6th 2008, the best night of my life when I saw them live.<br /><br />Recently I just went back and listened to this album, after not having heard it in so long. Honestly, I dunno what the fans are on when they say this is the best live album they've released. Perhaps they haven't heard \\"[[ASIN:B000063CPL Rock in Rio]]\\" yet??? This, to me, is a very OK-at-best set performance if you ask me. Now I will go through which songs are featured:<br /><br />POWERSLAVE<br />SONGS: Aces High, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Powerslave, Rime of the Ancient Mariner<br />COMMENTS: Bruce really struggles on \\"Aces High\\", which is rather unfortunate since it's the best on Powerslave. Everything else is pretty good, except they play Rime way too fast. When I saw them earlier this year, they played the above 4 songs better.<br /><br />PIECE OF MIND<br />SONGS: Revelations, Flight of Icarus, Die With Your Boots On, The Trooper<br />COMMENTS: I liked the faster approach to \\"Revelations\\", but Flight of Icarus... no. They butchered the living hell out of that song with the faster approach. The Trooper is pretty awesome and well-performed, Die With Your Boots On is OK, however again- Bruce struggles.<br /><br />THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST:<br />SONGS: 22 Acacia Avenue, The Number of the Beast, Run to the Hills<br />COMMENTS: Although Bruce doesn't sing the highest bit, RTTH is still well performed. NOTB is awesome as well and 22AA is pretty good as well.<br /><br />KILLERS:<br />SONGS: Wrathchild<br />COMMENTS: Bruce, I love you, you're my hero and favorite singer in the world, but let me just say... I'm glad you don't sing Wrathchild like THAT anymore.<br /><br />IRON MAIDEN:<br />SONGS: Sancturary, Running Free, Phantom of the Opera, Iron Maiden<br />COMMENTS: Gotta cut back on the yelling a bit. Bruce's SHOUTING instead of singing on Iron Maiden is really distracting, But seriously, Sanctuary and POTO are the 2 best songs performed off here. POTO is worth the price of this alone- Bruce sounds great here and the band tightly performing as usual. ANd Running Free is some good fun too, I love Bruce's comments in the middle. \\"What are you doing, sitting on your neighbor's [...] or something????\\"<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent live album but NOT thier best!!!! Maiden are my fave band and I I'll always own everything they release. Just know There IS better, and that Maiden are the best, that's all you need to know! UP THE IRONS!!!racting, But seriously, Sanctuary and POTO are the 2 best songs performed off here.

B00006FDCD|4.0|I bought this item .  Because I saw the movie via DVD rental .  From my local Blockbuster video rental store.  The story I thought is very good.  unlike most horror movie's /which I'm a big fan of the genra.  This movie has a very good story to it.  Eventhough the DVD rental was quite watchable I had a little troube with it skipping and freezing up/but it was still good enough fore me to descover a classic.  So I could not find the movie in my area.  So I looked online and found it on Amazon.  So I bought it online .  The DVD is in much better condition then the copy that I rented.  I had no trouble at all with it and was delighted that the movie s also widesscreen.  A aspect raio that I much prefer over Full screen.  Anyone who is thinking of buying this DVD can't go wrong with Amazon .com.  I'm very satisfied with my purcase from Amazon.            Paula Bettencourt
B001FMYOFY|4.0|I happened to have seen them, live, in Omaha, NE, and I was unaware of this album. I checked a few clips, and remember some of the songs They are mesmerizing.  Their style is what it is. Eclectic for sure, but their own. Not outstanding, but excellent.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is not your typical zombie fare. It's a book about what will happen if a major apocalyptic disease spreads through the world creating major devastation. And how one might survive: how nations may survive; and how we may continue on following such.   It covers the oral histories from the small individual, the famous person, the corporation and the governments. All very intersting. Some dispicable, some brave, some heroic. What fun.

B000002UW1|5.0|R.E.M. ended their tenure at IRS Records with their second 5-star album, \\"Document.\\" Having flirted with mainstream production with Don Geham on [[ASIN:B000002UVZ Lifes Rich Pageant]], the switch to producer Scott Litt kept the smoother, more arena ready sound, but brought back some of the band's trademark atmosphere. \\"Document\\" also became R.E.M.'s first album to sport a hit single, the breakout \\"The One I Love.\\"<br /><br />Along with The Police's [[ASIN:B000PHX4VA \\"Every Breath You Take,\\"]] \\"The One I Love's\\" tale of obsession and paranoia marks one of the most deceptive Top 10 love songs of the 80's. It also sported one of Peter Buck's heaviest riffs. Paired with the high speed rant of \\"It's The End Of The World as We Know It,\\" (which might as well have become a hit), \\"Document\\" boosted R.E.M, from the arms of its beloved cult and into the arms of the mainstream.<br /><br />Even with that new-found appeal, it's amazing just how political the band was becoming. \\"ITEOTWAWKI,\\" \\"King Of Birds\\" and \\"Welcome To The Occupation\\" all some charged lyrical content, upping the ante from \\"Pageant.\\" There was still plenty of jangle-pop and Byrds-ish chiming to go around, like \\"Finest Worksong\\" and \\"End of the World,\\" but by finding a sympathetic soul with Producer Litt (who would helm them for the next few albums and their peak [[ASIN:B000002MG1 Automatic for the People]], \\"Document\\" was R.E.M. hitting their stride and setting themselves up for the bidding war that Warner Brothers ultimately won ([[ASIN:B0006IIPEY Green]]).

B001GJ3VYG|5.0|I purchased No Angel 2 days after it came out in 1999. Back then, no one had heard of Dido. It took about a year before she even had a sizable fan base. And then with a combination of Here With Me's appearance on Roswell and Eminem's sampling of \\"Thank You\\" her career exploded.<br /><br />Since then, being a Dido fan has had it's ups and downs. The downs mostly consist of the long wait between albums. Long waits can be good for artists. It gives them a chance to live a normal life so they don't end up writing songs about things that are boring to most other people (like songs about touring or trying to write songs, for instance.) The down side is that expectations can be raised through the roof.<br /><br />The problem with the latter, in the instance of Safe Trip Home, is that this album isn't really about first impressions. On a first listen, the album can be listened to without any one thing really striking you. It's pleasant and pretty but it can sort of go in one ear and out the other. Some people may never get past this step. This is usually a problem for me. Not that I want an album full of pop hits, but I do like at least a few songs that hook me right away.<br /><br />But this isn't that type of album. For one thing, it very much feels like a complete unit. Dido comes back to the same themes again and again. The predominant ones seem to be death and love on this one. Some people might call it repetitive, but she never tackles them in the same way and dealing with the same themes isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, as long as you're saying something new. And in fact many of the songs can be read in a variety of ways if you don't just rely on Dido's bio info.<br /><br />The thing that might surprise some is how the album works it's way into your brain. It only took a couple repeat listens before I realized I was often humming parts of songs. The album reveals itself as more layered and complex then you might imagine on a first listen. I keep finding little things I missed before. I realize there's a greater emotional and tonal range then I first realized. I do miss having a real roof-raiser like Take My Hand on it, but Northern Skies is a lovely, more measured ending to the album.<br /><br />Dido's voice is the best it's ever been. It's incredibly confident - at the front of the songs, and relating emotion in a measured way rather then having to shrilly belt it out like some wannabe diva.<br /><br />As for individual songs, Don't Believe in Love, Grafton Street, It Comes and It Goes, Burnin' Love and The Day Before Today are definite standouts.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend spending a little extra on the deluxe version. \\"For One Day\\" is an amazing song that is far catchier then it's subject matter might suggest.<br /><br />So far the critics seem to love this one, and the general public seems to be a little mixed about it. I think, given time, people will see this for the masterpiece it is.I realize there's a greater emotional and tonal range then I first realized.

B000001F75|4.0|Pretty much the ultimate example of Thin Lizzy's genius is THIS album, because it covers so much variety and talent from the band.    You have the bluesy, funky rock of \\"Mama Nature Said\\", the cool funky beats and SMOKIN' guitar playin' of \\"The Hero and the Madman\\", and even more funkiness and blues with \\"Slow Blues\\".  However, those are NOT your typical blues and funky kind of songs- these are creative in a way that make them distinct to Thin Lizzy's style.  NOT ordinary songs!    \\"The Rocker\\" has some magnificent guitar playing at the end, \\"Gonna Creep Up on You\\" reminds me of an energetic pop band such as Sweet or Slade, and \\"A Song for While I'm Away\\" just has a very pretty melody.     Let's buy this great album, though personally, the first two Thin Lizzy albums are my favorite.  I recommend the debut album first because there's something REALLY special about that one!  Must be the diversity and creativity.  However, this is one fantastic album too.
0307386171|2.0|The premise of the book is nice....a young couple and the struggle to consumate their marriage on their wedding night. Only it falls very short.   It's boring, and lacks a lot of character build. It seems like the wedding is only about the consumation, and not because these two people want to be together. Well, it sorta is....there is not enough here to fill up a book, and it's a half hearted attempt. Ian McEwan can, and has done better. This book was a quick read, but was boring, and was not remarkable in any way. There was nothing special about this book or the story. The only thing that makes it readable is that Ian McEwan is atleast a good writer, his style is good, so it was not completely awful to read. I feel like he spit this one out though, as I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did.   I've read worse,but I've read a lot better too.
B00000FCBC|2.0|When I found out Metallica was doing an album of cover songs years ago, I was skeptical right away.  How can a thrash metal/speed metal band make it believable and create versions that surpass the originals?  Well, they couldn't.  This is just really really bad.   The entire collection.    Two hours of cover songs, and every single one of them inferior to the original versions.  The worst part is how many people went into this album probably not even aware of the original versions anyway, and just assumed \\"Well, it rocks, so Metallica's back!!\\" while completely ignoring how tasteless this collection of cover songs really is.     Maybe it's the vocals that ruin the entire thing?  Yeah, that's probably it.  Or maybe Metallica just wanted to abuse their thrash metal style by covering songs that do NOT -in ANY way- belong as part of a collection of thrash metal songs, such as the Blue Oyster Cult, Bob Seger, and Budgie tracks?      I think the Bob Seger song is the most offensive one to me personally, since people actually think it's superior to the Seger version.  It's actually far worse because Seger's version had a very good \\"late night smokey bar\\" atmosphere that THIS version lacks entirely, in addition to Seger's incredible voice on that track.      The lead singer from Metallica doesn't have a voice like that.  He's designed to be a heavy metal singer, not ANYWHERE close to Bob Seger's style.      I can go on and on about how these songs are inferior to their original versions, but I'll stop there.  Oh ok, one more- Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Astronomy\\" stinks here because it doesn't have any of the moody piano parts that the original version had.  Another inferior version.      Wanna know why \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" morphs into \\"A National Acrobat\\" halfway through the song?  Because the lead singer is incapable of singing the jam that finishes off \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\", and in fact, he doesn't even sing the middle section of the song either (you know, the \\"lovely lady\\" part that Ozzy Osbourne mastered).  Or maybe Metallica just didn't want to actually attempt the fantastic piano jam at the end.  Who knows.    Two hours of one inferior version after another is a bit much for me, however, just the fact they attempted such a daring thing is pretty historic for a band with their kind of reputation as influential metal Gods, so the album can't possibly receive a 1 star rating.    But, come to think of it, maybe Metallica was going through a dry spell coming up with new material and didn't know what to do?  Well, turning original songs into junk wasn't exactly a great idea.  You can't even tell most of these songs apart.  Maybe a band with more diversity would have been better for a cover song collection.    People need to be aware of the original versions before commenting on this album.  That way they'll see how inferior these cover songs are.  I bet if everyone was familiar with the original versions before writing a review for Garage Inc, the overall rating for the album would be down significantly
B001C3KCSY|5.0|This is one of the best groups to come around in awhile.  Great musicians, great song structure.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|I loved Coldplay's newest album \\"Viva La Vida.\\" To me the music was more polished and mature than their last two releases put together. Strong musicianship, dark progressive overtones, and sweeping soundscapes made that album powerful and majestic, something the music world desperately needed in these times of manufactured garbage the RIAA seems to throw at us daily.<br /><br />The songs on \\"Prospekt's March\\" were remixes, extras, and other bits and pieces from the \\"Viva\\" sessions. Most of what's here resembles what was on \\"Viva\\", and is just as powerful and exciting to listen to. \\"Life in Technicolour II\\" is an expanded version of what we heard on \\"Viva\\", and was actually slated to be the first single (with the lyrics) before Chris Martin axed it and the band decided to do something different with it. \\"Lovers in Japan\\" also appeared on \\"Viva\\" and appears here as well, in more of a remixed form (Osaka Mix, as it's called). The beautiful \\"Glass of Water\\" is majestic, and \\"Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground\\" could've easily been a single on its own.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the awesome song \\"Lost\\" is marred by the rapping of Jay-Z. I'm not sure what that was all about, and I suppose I should applaud Coldplay for their creativeness, but it just doesn't work. \\"Lost\\" is an epic piece that fit snugly into the \\"Viva\\" story and this version here pays horrible tribute to that song. This is not to disrespect Jay-Z, it's just that \\"Lost\\" is a masterpiece on its own, and interspersing rap bits over it just doesn't work.<br /><br />All in all, though, it's nice to have an EP release like this. Bands don't do this much anymore, and it's nice to have the sophistication and musicianship of a band like Coldplay which allows us to hear the scrapped bits, if you will, in addition to the more polished material.<br /><br />For those who are vinyl buffs, this is available on a limited edition LP as well. Amazon is stocking that as well.<br /><br />Happy Listening!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|... but how should I rate it?    I realize this is Enya just after some first notes of a song.  I can't predict what's next in the melodies.  I can memorize each song after just one listen.  Should I call it \\"more of the same\\"?    Some friends of mine, who are not Enya fans and did not like Amarantine, like this a lot.  Should I call it \\"for fans only\\"?    After listening to the whole album for quite some time now I'd say And Winter Came has melodies even more refreshing than Amarantine. Enya's strongest album might be another one, I admit.  But should I lower the rating for this one if I gave that one 5 stars?    Of course not.
0307237699|5.0|President Barack Obama (Sounds great, doesn't it?)from Illinois and the Democratic Party's new rock star, is that rare politician who can actually write -- and write movingly and genuinely about himself.<br /><br />His 1995 memoir, \\"Dreams From My Father,\\" written before Mr. Obama entered politics, provided a revealing, introspective account of his efforts to trace his family's tangled roots and his attempts to come to terms with his absent father, who left home when he was still a toddler. That book did an evocative job of conjuring the author's multicultural childhood: his father was from Kenya, his mother was from Kansas, and the young Mr. Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia.<br /><br />And it was equally candid about his youthful struggles: pot, booze and \\"maybe a little blow,\\" he wrote, could \\"push questions of who I was out of my mind,\\" flatten \\"out the landscape of my heart, blur the edges of my memory.\\" Most memorably, the book gave the reader a heartfelt sense of what it was like to grow up in the 1960's and 70's, straddling America's color lines: the sense of knowing two worlds and belonging to neither, the sense of having to forge an identity of his own.<br /><br />Mr. Obama's new book, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" -- the phrase comes from his 2004 Democratic Convention keynote address, which made him the party's rising young hope -- is much more of a political document. Portions of the volume read like outtakes from a stump speech, and the bulk of it is devoted to laying out Mr. Obama's policy positions on a host of issues, from education to health care to the war in Iraq.<br /><br />But while Mr. Obama occasionally slips into the flabby platitudes favored by politicians, enough of the narrative voice in this volume is recognizably similar to the one in \\"Dreams From My Father,\\" an elastic, personable voice that is capable of accommodating everything from dense discussions of foreign policy to streetwise reminiscences, incisive comments on constitutional law to New-Agey personal asides. The reader comes away with a feeling that Mr. Obama has not reinvented himself as he has moved from job to job (community organizer in Chicago, editor of The Harvard Law Review, professor of constitutional law, civil rights lawyer, state senator) but has instead internalized all those roles, embracing rather than shrugging off whatever contradictions they might have produced.<br /><br />Reporters and politicians continually use the word authenticity to describe Mr. Obama, pointing to his ability to come across to voters as a regular person, not a prepackaged pol. And in these pages he often speaks to the reader as if he were an old friend from back in the day, salting policy recommendations with colorful asides about the absurdities of political life.<br /><br />He recalls a meet-and-greet encounter at the White House with George W. Bush, who warmly shook his hand, then \\"turned to an aide nearby, who squirted a big dollop of hand sanitizer in the president's hand.\\" (\\"Good stuff,\\" he quotes the president as saying, as he offered his guest some. \\"Keeps you from getting colds.\\") And he recounts a trip he took through Illinois with an aide, who scolded him for asking for Dijon mustard at a T.G.I. Friday's, worried the senator would come across as an elitist; the confused waitress, he adds, simply said: \\"We got Dijon if you want it.\\"<br /><br />In his 2004 keynote address Mr. Obama spoke of the common ground Americans share: \\"There is not a Black America and White America and Latino America and Asian America -- there's the United States of America.\\" And the same message -- rooted in his own youthful efforts to grapple with racial stereotypes, racial loyalty and class resentments -- threads its way through the pages of this book. Despite the red state-blue state divide, despite racial, religious and economic divisions, Mr. Obama writes, \\"we are becoming more, not less, alike\\" beneath the surface: \\"Most Republican strongholds are 40 percent Democrat, and vice versa. The political labels of liberal and conservative rarely track people's personal attributes.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Obama eschews the Manichean language that has come to inform political discourse, and he rejects what he sees as the either-or formulations of his elders who came of age in the 60's: \\"In the back-and-forth between Clinton and Gingrich, and in the elections of 2000 and 2004,\\" he writes, \\"I sometimes felt as if I were watching the psychodrama of the Baby Boom generation -- a tale rooted in old grudges and revenge plots hatched on a handful of college campuses long ago -- played out on the national stage. The victories that the 60's generation brought about -- the admission of minorities and women into full citizenship, the strengthening of individual liberties and the healthy willingness to question authority -- have made America a far better place for all its citizens. But what has been lost in the process, and has yet to be replaced, are those shared assumptions -- that quality of trust and fellow feeling -- that bring us together as Americans.\\"<br /><br />His thoughts on domestic and foreign policy try to hew to this consensus-building line. Some of his recommendations devolve into little more than fuzzy statements of the obvious: i.e., that America's \\"addiction to oil\\" is affecting the economy and undermining national security, or that the education system needs to be revamped and improved. Others echo Bill Clinton's \\"third way,\\" methodically triangulating between traditionally conservative and traditionally liberal ideas.<br /><br />Mr. Obama writes that \\"conservatives -- and Bill Clinton -- were right about welfare as it was previously structured: By detaching income from work and by making no demands on welfare recipients other than a tolerance for intrusive bureaucracy and an assurance that no man lived in the same house as the mother of his children, the old A.F.D.C. program sapped people of their initiative and eroded their self respect.\\"<br /><br />He uses the Bush administration's tough language to talk about national security in the age of terrorism (\\"if we have to go it alone, the American people stand ready to pay any price and bear any burden to protect our country\\") but adds, crucially, that \\"once we get beyond matters of self-defense,\\" he is \\"convinced that it will almost always be in our strategic interest to act multilaterally rather than unilaterally when we use force around the world.\\"<br /><br />He assails President Bush for waging an unnecessary and misguided war in Iraq and for promoting an \\"Ownership Society\\" that \\"magnifies the uneven risks and rewards of today's winner-take-all economy.\\" Yet he also takes the Democrats to task for becoming \\"the party of reaction\\": \\"In reaction to a war that is ill-conceived, we appear suspicious of all military action. In reaction to those who proclaim the market can cure all ills, we resist efforts to use market principles to tackle pressing problems. In reaction to religious overreach, we equate tolerance with secularism and forfeit the moral language that would help infuse our policies with a larger meaning. We lose elections and hope for the courts to foil Republican plans. We lose the courts and wait for a White House scandal.\\"<br /><br />This volume does not possess the searching candor of the author's first book. But Mr. Obama strives in these pages to ground his policy thinking in simple common sense -- be it \\"growing the size of our armed forces to maintain reasonable rotation schedules\\" or reining in spending and rethinking tax policy to bring down the nation's huge deficit -- while articulating these ideas in level-headed, nonpartisan prose.

B000IU3XTM|5.0|While I do prefer \\"O\\" to \\"9\\", this CD is still very remarkable. Damien Rice was bold with this CD, especially with his \\"Rootless Tree\\" where he swears \\"F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, and all we've been through. Leave it, leave it, leave it. It's nothing to you. And if you hate me, hate me, hate me, then hate me so good that you can let me out.\\" Although the swearing is definitely loud and bold, it is sung in a remarkable, breathtaking way that just makes you want to scream it at the top of your lungs. This is an amazing song for after a break up. This song got me through a really tough time when the guy I loved for two years told me we couldn't be together anymore. Naturally, I usually run for the sappy love songs that either talk about two people falling deeply in love or someone being alone for the rest of their life, but instead, I opted for \\"Rootless Tree\\" and my heart sped the entire time I had it on repeat. Damien Rice's music is theaputic.

My son is allergic to eggs and dairy, and this book has made the transition to removing those items from our home so much easier.  My only complaint is the amounts given - my rule of thumb is that for whatever it says it will make, I'll get almost 2x that amount from the recipe.
0385493622|5.0|\\"Fermat's Enigma\\" is a first rate crossover book that bridges the gap between the math focused academic's world with that of lay person who is interested in math theory but lacks the in-depth training to fully understand advanced concepts. While I enjoy math and passed calculus in High School, my father reminded me of Andrew Wiles and can see how the search (or really quest) can consume a person.<br /><br />The book is very well written and is engaging form start to finnish. The examples and side stroies are also enjoyable and presented in a way almost anyone can follow.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book just as much as the other three. Finishing the story was bittersweet. I can't get enough of the characters, yet the saga has to come to an end. I'm sad to see the end of the Twilight Saga. I hope that maybe Stephenie Meyer writes more stories about these lovable, wonderful characters.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series.  We love it!    It is set as a sci-fi western, complete with cattle rustling in a space ship.  A group of  \\"honorable smugglers\\"  cruising the galaxy trying to make a living get caught in the drama of  a young doctor trying to rescue his sister from the clutches of the \\"Alliance\\".  Funny, but not a comedy.  The acting is great. The characters are very real-- very believable.  The script is well written with subtle humor (some a little dark).   Plenty of drama and action.    There are sexual references and some graphic violence, so may not be suitable for younger viewers.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I never enjoyed \\"war\\" movies and wasn't looking forward to sitting down to watch this miniseries, but my husband really wanted me to see it after watching it himself.  I was surprised at how amazing and interesting this story is, and I am humbled to witness the integrity of these men, their fear, how many of them were able to put aside this fear and persevere in the worst conditions.  Their conviction is truly admirable.    The action scenes are exciting, and I find myself watching this miniseries, or parts of it, over and over.    Highly recommended.
B00000IQC8|3.0|--------------<br />[first lines]<br />Dante Hicks: [phone rings and Dante falls out of a closet] Hello. What? No I don't work today, I'm playing hockey at two.<br />=====================<br /><br />'Clerks' is the debut film of Kevin Smith, inspired by Richard Linklater's 'Slackers;' and it is the first movie in the 'View Askew' universe, a series of Kevin Smith films with interlocking characters and references. 'Clerks' is a student film financed with credit cards and loans from friends. An interesting bit of trivia is that the entire production cost only $26,000 and securing the rights to the music cost $27,000, more than the cost of making the film. With over 50% of the budget in the music, you'd think they'd have some really great songs, but you'd be wrong. Just run-of-the-mill punk and metal.<br /><br />--------------<br />Coroner: What kind of convenience store do you run here?<br />=====================<br /><br />Based loosely on \\"The Divine Comedy\\" by Dante Alighieri, there are nine breaks in the movie to signify the nine rings of hell. Did I mention loosely? James Joyce's 'Ulysses' and the Coen Brothers' 'O, Brother, Where Art Thou?' were both based on Homer, and they were based loosely, I'd say--but to really say 'Clerks' is based on Dante's 'Inferno' is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />--------------<br />Blue Collar Man: Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt, but, uh, what are you talking about?<br />Randal Graves: The ending of \\"Return of the Jedi\\".<br />Dante Hicks: My friend here's trying to convince me that any independent contractors who were working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when it was destroyed by the Rebels.<br />=====================<br /><br />The clerks in 'Clerks' are Dante and Randal. Dante is the slightly more responsible of the pair. Though he resents being forced to clerk at Quick Mart on his day off instead of playing hockey, as he was looking forward to, he soldiers on--albeit closing the store briefly to play an ad hoc game of hockey on the roof and to attend a funeral. Customers constantly interrupt his reveries.<br /><br />--------------<br />Cold Coffee Lover: What do you mean there's no ice? You mean I gotta drink this coffee hot?<br />=====================<br /><br />Randal, who works at a nearby video store, is slightly less responsible. He embodies 'customer disservice' throughout. He leaves his video store because he wants to rent a video, a good video at a good video store--NOT the one he works at. The rest of the time he spends shooting the breeze with Dante at Quick Mart, or abusing his customers.<br /><br />--------------<br />Indecisive Video Customer: These are the same two movies! You weren't paying any attention!<br />Randal Graves: No, I wasn't.<br />Indecisive Video Customer: I don't think your manager would appreciate it if-<br />Randal Graves: I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.<br />Indecisive Video Customer: I beg your pardon?<br />Randal Graves: Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.<br />Indecisive Video Customer: I was only pointing out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.<br />Randal Graves: And I hope it feels good.<br />Indecisive Video Customer: You hope *what* feels good?<br />Randal Graves: I hope it feels so good to be right. There's nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?<br />Indecisive Video Customer: Well, this is the last time I rent here.<br />Randal Graves: You'll be missed.<br />=====================<br /><br />Kevin Smith actually worked at the Quick Mart where 'Clerks' was filmed, and he was only allowed to film at night. Thus, the shutters had to be drawn and the premise for this was that pranksters had put gum in the locks of the shutters. He makes a sign with shoe polish so people will know the store is open which leads to a running gag about how he smells like shoe polish. It wasn't funny the first time, and gets less so with each repetition. But that ishow he rolls, improvising around obstacles and limitations.<br /><br />--------------<br />Dante Hicks: This is different, this is important. How many?<br />[long pause as customer buys something]<br />Dante Hicks: Well?<br />Veronica Loughran: Something like... 36.<br />Dante Hicks: What? Something like 36?<br />Veronica Loughran: Lower your voice.<br />Dante Hicks: Wait, what is that anyway, something like 36? Does that INCLUDE me?<br />Veronica Loughran: Ummm... 37.<br />Dante Hicks: I'm 37?<br />=====================<br /><br />'Clerks' introduces the characters of Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers who hang around in front of the Quick Mart. Silent Bob is played by director Kevin Smith himself, and he says little, to allow motor mouth Jay more airtime. When he does speak on occasion, you listen. curious as to what he will finally say.<br /><br />--------------<br />Silent Bob: [His only line] You know, there's a million fine looking women in the world, dude. But they don't all bring you lasagna at work. Most of 'em just cheat on you.<br />=====================<br /><br />Dante's dilemma, apart from him being dissatisfied with his station in life and being forced to clerk on his day off, is that he has a girlfriend but can't get his ex-girlfriend out of his mind. He has been communicating with her, and they may get back together again, but he is conflicted.<br /><br />--------------<br />Caitlin Bree: I'm offering you my body and you're offering me semantics.<br />=====================<br /><br />'Clerks' is an interesting student film with loads of flaws--yet it has a certain charm and promises better things to come.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|OK, bear with me a bit here. I need to explain something.    I am a Star Trek fan of long standing, 35+ years at this point.     When I first heard that the original series was going to be re-released with all new effects, I was less than thrilled. Maybe this attitude is foreign to the younger people, but there is, for me, a certain charm in the original effects. While I acknowledge that the effects in the original Star Trek are sometimes not slick as you see in modern films, people need to realize and appreciate that they were working before the time of computer generated graphics -- and on a television budget. In short, the effects on the original series stand as an example of what dedicated, talented people could do when it all had to be done \\"the hard way\\". And it seemed disrespectful, at least, of that achievement to replace the hard work of those people. In fact, it seemed to me, at first, to really be just another way for more money to be milked out of both the fans and the series.    Then I started thinking. And reading. And considering. And, finally, I decided to take a peek for myself.    What I found is that the new effects are, as expected, as perfect as only a computer can make them. Perfect effects are, really, getting to be a ho-hum thing to me. I realize and recognize that it still takes talent and skill to create effects using a computer, but, honestly, when you can realize on the screen literally anything you want as easily as anything else... well, it just isn't the same. There just isn't that sense of \\"Wow, how did they DO that?\\" anymore.    But...    What I also found was that great and loving care was taken to preserve and actually enhance the original episodes through the use of this new technology.     Regardless of any debate on the merits of doing it or not, it's done -- and the results are superb.     The accompanying \\"bonus features\\" are also quite good.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|This is a great product.  I've had it for 6 months and I've had no problems with it.  I'm not sure why some people have problems with the pole.  I use it all the time to pick up messes.  Please do not expect it to replace your vacuum cleaner or your broom and dust pan.  This product is not intended to sweep your whole house.  The battery doesn't last that long and the little dust pan is small.  What this is great for is to pick up in between cleanings.  Do you ever have company over and little pieces of chips spill on the carpet?  And have you ever had to drag out the vacuum cleaner to vacuum the area where your guests were, like the living room or dining area?  Or do you have small kids and they spill around the kitchen table?  Then you'll love this.  It's light and doesn't require plugging in.  Pull it out, sweep the mess, clean out the tray, and put it away.  For that, I love it.  It's like a broom for your carpet.  I don't expect it to clean my whole house.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|I've read some of the reviews for  Evolver, I wonder what type of music they listen too. I love this John Legend CD. True; I still listen to Once Again everyday, because I think the choice of songs on that cd or more laid back and groovy. Evolver is great it takes you to another place, it reminds me that some artist still make good music. If your Grown and Sexy purchase this cd. You want be disapointed. \\"I can't wait to see Mr. Legend in concert\\".
B0019EXZY4|4.0|I went into \\"The Bank Job\\" thinking it would be a rather formulaic cinematic take on the bank heist genre.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised.  This is quite good stuff!  I especially liked the 'Extras' on the DVD, which reinforced how much of the tale was snatched from a real-life event.  Hats off to co-writers Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais for wrapping a taut thriller around that.<br /><br />I was looking for a way to characterize my feeling about Jason Statham.  Then, I read this pitch-perfect gem from reviewer Monkdude on these pages:  \\"I'm not the biggest Jason Statham fan, mainly because he always looks and sounds the same in every role, but here he shows a little more range and is quite likeable.\\"<br /><br />Exactly!  He'll always be Handsome Rob ([[ASIN:B0000B1OFL The Italian Job (Special Collector's Edition)]]) in my book.  Lucky for me, he continues to play slight variations on that role.  Hey, why mess with success?  The guy's carved out quite a good career, despite having started as a model.  [Guy Ritchie put him [[ASIN:B00007ELEP Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels (Widescreen Edition)]] straight from a French Connection UK ad shoot.]<br /><br />What struck me in the Extras is how Statham's managers picked and shepherded this film as a project for him.  [I think this was Steve Chasman discussing this point - he's a producer of the film.]  I'm impressed.  As I mentioned earlier, Statham's got a nice little career going.  Good management has definitely played a part in that.  Good show, Steve Chasman.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Well I really loved the soundtrack, and not just because I'm a huge Twilight fan. I haven't even watched the movie yet, because it's not released yet in my country.<br />For a person who mostly listens to alternative rock, this CD is really great, and it's up to my expectations! I have already been a fan of many bands, including Muse and Linkin Park. The songs vary from pop/rock, to a little bit of electronica and funky beats. When I listen to it, it really reminds me of Bella and Edward, and I would recommend it to everyone!
B001E75QGG|4.0|\\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is an entertaining Indy film.  It's no \\"Raiders\\" or even \\"Crusade,\\" but it's good for what it is.  Over-the-top action, a little romance, some vaguely paranormal archeological mystery: it checked all the boxes.  Those who consider it unbelievable may want to look at the premises of the previous movies.  You have to be willing to suspend your disbelief and accept the internal logic of Indiana Jones World.  Ultimately, the film hewed to its own internal logic, moved at a decent pace, and was entertaining.<br /><br />Shia LaBoeuf takes a lot of flak from reviewers, but I thought he did a good job with the material he had to work with.  I cringed when he made his Brando-ripoff entrance, but that wasn't his fault - he didn't set up that shot, pick out his wardrobe or select a motorcycle.  Frankly, he held up well against Harrison Ford, and although I'm not keen to see a Young Indiana Jones movie with him as Indy the Third, he was fine in this movie.<br /><br />I loved Karen Allen in the original \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\"  She stole that movie from Harrison Ford in virtually every scene, and Marion Ravenswood was as much as part of what made \\"Raiders\\" a classic as Indiana Jones.  She was the girl next door who could also drink you and an Mongolian yak herder under the table.  But in \\"Crystal Skull,\\" I don't know if it was Allen or the script, but she came across as flat and unengaging.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is at least worth a rent.  And while you're watching, ponder the fact that 5000 year old civilizations had robust technology and elaborate traps that still work 5000 years later, while you probably have a hard time getting your car to start reliably.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is indeed a beatifull video. Most of the video recordings were made  on high definition. I loved the video and never get bored. I trully recommend it.
0375842209|4.0|An interesting take on the Holocaust, with Death taking a staring and sympathetic role.  A young girl without family is taken in by a couple who become her only mother and father.  Her interactions with the children of the town and its adults, especially the mayor's wife, shows a maturity beyond her years.      She arrives at her new home with a book about grave digging that she has retrieved from the cemetery where her brother was buried.  Not being able to read the book her new father teaches her to read.  This occurs nightly when she awakens after having nightmares and he spends the nights in her room to comfort her.      The horror of the Holocaust becomes real when a young Jewish man comes to their house to hide.  The two become friends and reading and writing becomes integral to both of them as they seek some sense out of the disaster happening around them.    Over time she pilfers more books, most of all from the Mayor's library with the tacit approval of his wife, who suffers from the death of her son  in the previous war.    The book offers a somewhat sympathetic portrayal of German townspeople caught up in the war and the extermination of the Jews.  Some, including her father, are sickened by what they see and try to help but are ostracized and sent to fight in the war.  Others caught up in the government propaganda against the Jews show how easy it is to debase their own humanity.    I do recommend the book, it's written for the young adult audience but older readers would find much to value in it as well.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|WHat a great album.  Burn it to the ground, is probly my all time favorite NB song.  Top notch.  Thanks guys for the good music
B000UOOT1W|5.0|All the selections are very good especially the alternate version of the song, \\"The Game of Love\\" by Tina Turner which is really special.
B001AIRUOU|4.0|I bought the special edition DVD for my husband on our anniversary.  We were all excited to watch it on Halloween...as we were watching it my husband realized that they cut out some parts...the best part of \\"This is Halloween\\" song.  My husband was disappointed b/c he loves that song and he noticed that a few lines from the song were cut.  We don't know if our DVD skipped, got a bad copy or if this was actually cut from the original version.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Good songs if you like Shania you can't go wromg with this cd. I give it 5 stars!!
B0000009SG|5.0|I have wanted this on disc for many years, I think its great that it is still available.
6305428042|5.0|No matter what age you are you will enjoy this movie.  I can watch it many many times and not get bored. Good movie I due recommend it!
B001F290E4|3.0|I love Seal. I completely respect David Foster's talent.  The combination of the two, however, does not make for a good \\"soul\\" record.  Any soul that Seal brings to this project is quashed by David Foster's stale, limp, elevator music arrangements of these outstanding soul classics.  All of the production and instrumentation on each and every track sounds exactly the same, a very monotonous affair indeed.  Why Seal didn't get someone with a bit of soul to produce this record is beyond me.  A total swing and a miss.  Though not offensive, this is Muzak for the masses.
141694740X|1.0|Okay ladies, sure we can read this book to shock us into the truth about our guys, but didn't we know it anyway?  I think back how many times I tried to convince myself that things between a man and myself were acceptable and good, \\"if only he'd......\\" (fill in the blank.)  Bottom line is, I just wasn't willing to admit to myself what I ALREADY knew was true - he wasn't working out, it's not \\"really\\" a fit, and I include in the not-a-fit category that if I think he's the one, and he doesn't think I am the one, then it is NOT a fit.  So I decided NOT to read this book (although I had several years ago) for the new guy I'm dating.  Had I read this book, I would have jumped ship with this great guy I'm dating way too early and it would have never come to be what it is now - the perfect guy for me. (Gorgeous, 6'2\\", smart, living from his heart and 11 years younger.)  INSTEAD of following the book, I trusted my gut and that never lies and have the guy I hoped for.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I agree that this film is an absolute masterpiece, so I'll just review it's Blu-Ray attributes.  The digital mastering and sound is simply superb. On a 1080p display, the picture is so clear that it looks like a 3D live puppet show happening in your living room.  The audio is absolutely stunning too.  On a surround sound system, this disc simply rocks.  With all of the added commentary and bonus features this Blu-Ray Disc is an absolute must for any Hi-Def aficionado.  Highly recommended.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|I love the CD.  It has better songs than the last CD and shows that he has definitely evolved.  Love it!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The collection is excellent. It was only the CD #1 which came with some scratchs. However the film can run normally. I decided to keep it instead of returning just for that. It's an excellent collection. Now I'm going for another one...
0385338724|4.0|Lexi suffers from amnesia after a car accident, which has her forget the past 3 years of her life.  As a result, she has no recollection of the man she married, the promotion in her job, the fallout with her best friends, etc.  She tries to carry on with everyone as if it was 3 years earlier, but in fact, it isn't.  In the midst of all that, Jon is claiming they were having an affair and are deeply in love, while Lexi swears she would never do such a thing.  As the story progresses, she uncovers that her husband Eric isn't all he's cracked up to be, and Jon might have some validity to his claim.  While a situation like this would be devastating, Kinsella approaches the subject with humor, as she always does, leaving Lexi to pick up the pieces and mend relationships she had broken before the accident happened.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, because I felt there were many questions left unanswered and I wasn't ready to say goodbye to Lexi's story just yet.  Could this mean a sequel is in the works?  I sure hope so!!
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|All right, so I've bought and listened to \\"And Winter Came\\", just as I have bought and listened to all of Enya's other albums. I'd like to think that I am one of Enya's earliest fans, since I was 16 when I saw the video for \\"Orinoco Flow\\" on VH1 in January 1989. At the time, no one I knew had ever heard of Enya, and I was the first on my block to introduce her unique musical vision to the people in my circle.<br /><br />Since that time, Enya's albums have been interchangeable. I guarantee each Enya album has at least six good songs on it, surrounded by five or six others that are just okay. To me, this means any Enya album is five stars or, and minimum, three stars, depending on your point of view.<br /><br />I listened to \\"And Winter Came\\" with several observations. For example, this is supposed to be a Christmas/seasonal album, but really it seems more like a regular Enya album. There are a few songs that specifically mention Christmas, but \\"And Winter Came\\" does not sound like a Christmas album to me. This is good.<br /><br />Next, for the first time in a long time, I actually felt that Enya stretched herself musically. Maybe not as great of a stretch as I would truly like to see from her, but still, \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\" is as Beatles-ish as anything she's attempted. How refreshing to hear drums and guitar in her music for once. This is what I have been complaining about since \\"The Memory of Trees\\". It's still undeniably Enya, but if this is an indicator of things to come, I have a renewed interest in her music.<br /><br />The other tracks I liked were \\"White is in the Winter Night\\", \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\", \\"Dreams Are More Precious\\", \\"Last Time by Moonlight\\" and \\"One Toy Soldier\\"--again, a song that puts Enya outside her comfort box. It's slow marching beat, like a wind up toy soldier, is just unusual enough to be something out of the ordinary for Enya.<br /><br />So this is how I put \\"And Winter Came\\" into context with her other releases:<br /><br />1986 Enya/The Celts: Three Stars<br />1988 Watermark: Three and a Half Stars<br />1991 Shepherd Moons: Four Stars<br />1995 The Memory of Trees: Three Stars<br />2000 A Day Without Rain: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 Amarantine: Three Stars<br />2008 And Winter Came: Three and a Half Starsand a Half Stars  1991 Shepherd Moons: Four Stars  1995 The Memory of Trees: Three Stars  2000 A Day Without Rain: Three and a Half Stars  2005 Amarantine: Three Stars  2008 And Winter Came: Three and a Half Stars
0446402389|5.0|Leo Stepanovich Demidov is a member of the MGB, the State Security Force for the Soviet Union and one of MGB's top investigative detectives. When it comes to loyalty, Leo is the most loyalists of men. He serves his country well and for that he is rewarded handsomely. In a country where any talk of disloyalty whether it be from reading a book or talk of being a traitor, can be punishment by death.<br /><br />Suddenly Leo finds himself in a moral situation. He is put in charge of investigating his wife, Raisa. Accusations have been made against Raisa saying she is a traitor to her country. Leo now has to make a choice whether he turns his wife in like a good agent or stand up for him and his wife. The choice is obvious. Leo gets demoted to the lowest of lows when he is sent away to be part of the militia. His duties now consist of him cleaning prisoner's cells. When the body of a fourteen year old girl is found with her mouth filled with dirt and her intestines ripped out, Leo believes this was no accident but indeed a murder. He starts investigating and what he discovers is more heinous than anything Leo could imagine.<br /><br />I kept seeing Child 44 showing up everywhere on the web. People were saying good things about this book. I am proud to say I too can't stop saying wonderful things about Child 44. This can only be achieved by an author like Tom Rob Smith. Mr. Rob Smith fused this book with such raw emotions of love, loyalty, loss, and trust. When you take a character like Leo, who experiences all of these emotions at the same time you end up with something truly amazing that will leave readers talking about Child 44 for a long time to come. I know I will. Child 44 is Tom Rob Smith's first novel. He should be proud of it. I give this book five stars and if I could give it more I would. I anxiously await his next novel.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|This CD contains songs that show Taylor's abilities as a songwriter and singer.<br />She is extremely talented and her songs are heartfelt and appealing.<br /><br />\\"Love Story\\", \\"Hey Stephen\\" and \\"Change\\" are favorites- the whole CD is just extraordinary!<br />I look forward to all her future endeavors.
0765360969|5.0|I came across this Sanderson's series after reading Patrick Rothfuss's amazing book, THE NAME OF THE WIND.  I soon found the author's blog, began reading through it, and saw a recommendation he made for this series.    This first book of Sanderson's MISTBORN trilogy introduces readers to a world where a hero has already \\"won\\" against the evil (called \\"the deepness\\") but has, since then, controlled the world for a millennium as its Lord Ruler, maintaining order with an increasingly tightening iron fist.  Sanderson has created a complex but well-developed system of magic - a world where the consuming and \\"burning\\" of specific metals gives those with the talent for it the ability to do great feats, from pulling or pushing themselves through the air to affecting the emotions of those around them or even seeing the future.  While most with such talent - called Mistings -can only use one of the eight metals, there are a few, called the Mistborn, who can burn all eight.  One of these Mistborn, Kelsier, gathers a group of talented Mistings - including a young female street \\"skaa\\" named Vin - to fight against the oppressive regime.  But there's more to his plan - and to his young recruit - than we might expect.    The world Sanderson crafts is distinctive and engaging.  His characters and creatures - the charismatic and erratic Kelsier, the quiet yet brave Vin, the reserved, wise Terrisman named Sazed, the horrifying Steel Inquisitors - provide a panoply of personalities and types both new and reminiscent of mythological types in epic tales.  It didn't take long for the story to hook me, and I'm now speeding through the second tale - THE WELL OF ASCENSION - and looking forward to reading THE HERO OF AGES.  For lovers of new fantasy worlds - and for those who just love great stories! - I'd highly recommend this series.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|When the music started, I stopped; and I didn't get up again until the last tune had run its course.  I was mesmerized, and felt as though I had been taken on a journey through the icons of the Winter Solstcie Season.  I was a fan of \\"A Winter's Garden,\\" and have always wondered what a new full length CD from Ms. Mckennitt would be like; now I know.  _And this CD was definitely worth waiting for -- it is a tapestry of poignant emotions, sensual touchstones and richly imbued musical artistry that has not a single cliched \\"holiday\\" tune on it.  The five pieces from the earlier CD are integrated into a new playlist that does not merely bookend the old line-up with new songs.  There are two instrumentals on the CD, (\\"Un Flambeau, Jeannette, Isabelle\\" and \\"Breton Carol\\"), both with interesting instrumentation and arranement.  There is an a capella tune -- \\"Gloucestershire Wassail\\" that provides an unexpected punctuation in the line-up.  The version of \\"O Come O Come Emmanuel\\" sung in Latin is full of a joyful melancholy--just as it should be.  Overall, I get a deep sense of beauty and peace from the CD, and I imagine I will have many Christmas dreams while listening to it, as the Winter Solstice comes and goes.  I highly recommend it.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|The Set List is Great!! Oh By the Way , I was at the Show in New Orleans the Earlier Part of the Tour, and at the end of the Tour in Atlanta, and in Atlanta they were at Their Best!!! So if you buy this DVD Just for the Atlanta Disk Itself, it would Be Worth Every Cent!!! Andy Lee
B000A5044C|5.0|Nobody Knows (Dare mo shiranai) is based on a true story of children left on their own for months on end to fend for themselves in a Tokyo apartment. Cautioned to remain hidden, as the landlord only knew about one child instead of four, the three younger ones constantly stay inside, away from any contact with the rest of the world.<br /><br />I was struck by several things about this film. First, what may be a cultural difference between Japan and America - the gentleness and slowness of their lives' rhythms, down to the way the children put books into the shelf or take dishes out of the cupboard. I found this pace, combined with the sweetness to their communal laying around instead of isolation in individual bedrooms with technology to occupy their minds, beautiful and inspiring - even if it is intended to show the ennui that eventually comes with being continually trapped indoors.<br /><br />This brings me to the second point. I am surprised that Koreeda didn't show the kids showing any ill effects from being cooped up like that. They had no way to use their bodies in real physical activity, and no connection with nature, dirt, weather, or other animals. This would surely drive a person mad - yet these children remain sweet to each other and even creative.<br /><br />The children seek nature and their own wild selves anyway, drawing pictures on whatever paper is available (such as an overdue water bill) and posting them all over the walls; and their one illicit outing led to their collecting precious seeds of \\"weeds\\", which they then carefully planted in leftover ramen containers to bloom an unkempt wildflower garden on their balcony. The film shows the poignant human yearning toward Beauty, no matter how dire the circumstances.<br /><br />The oldest girl cannot accept that her mother has abandoned them, and scenes like her wistfully fingering a stain on the floor left by a spilled bit of nailpolish from their last time together just breaks your heart.<br /><br />The oldest boy who's left in charge, played by the very deep Yuya Yagira, is much more pragmatic about facing the truth about their situation. He also exhibits a lot more maturity than the mother, taking on responsibility for his siblings and letting go of all his studies except math, in order to calculate their dwindling ability to deal with the household expenses. Although clearly out of his league in terms of the responsibility loaded onto him, he does what he can to keep them all fed, bathed, and happy; and to get money to achieve this, from seeking out several of their missing fathers to trying to get a job even though he's underage. Yet he refuses to sink low even in dire straits - (mild spoiler coming) - he won't steal food even to keep his new pals, and he won't accept money from another friend gained through means he disapproves of. His nobility of spirit is one of the shining forces that makes this film so compelling.<br /><br />The kids rarely show any sort of emotion, another trait of this movie that I found odd, and wonder if it may be cultural. Even when confronted with death, there are no tears. This stoicism, exhibited even in the youngest, makes the few moments when subtle anger or despair do show all the more powerful. When a crisis strikes and the oldest boy tries desperately to contact his mother at a number where she's obviously gone off to form a new family, he gets told to wait so long that his payphone coins run out. He slowly puts the receiver down and collapses his forehead against the phone. This simple action conveys more bleak, aware despair than any wailing would.<br /><br />The ending was initially unsatisfying to me because there really isn't one. You know darned well that these kids can't go on this way for very long, that something will have to give - the landlady will come back again for the unpayable rent and kick them out; they will be discovered; something. But on second thought, I realize that maybe this unsettling aspect is part of the film's genius. People live like this in cities all over the world, and this sort of situation does go on and on and on with no resolution.<br /><br />If you want to know more about 'the real story' this film was based on, I found Wikipedia to provide the clearest and most concise source. ([...]  Reading it, one can see how the director deliberately changed the story to avoid an easy `good vs. evil' theme. He also chose to alter the storyline to eliminate the sort of blood-n-guts scenes so ubiquitous to American films.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|For those looking for an improvement over the DVD and VHS releases, Blu-Ray is here!  With the awesome quality of most blu-ray movies being released today, it is easy to get spoiled. Older films rarely look truly hi-definition when compared to current releases. However, when it is a truly great film like this, I do not mind spending money on yet another version of the same movie, provided it is significantly better than the previous versions. All too often this is not the case. Here the studio has done an exemplary job of restoring the original film. I never saw it in the theater, but I cannot imagine it looked any better at my neighborhood theaters back then. This film will always deserve 5 stars as a movie. However, this 5-star review is for the restoration!
B00007KWHG|5.0|Excellent quality from Frankie Valli & 4 seasons, as well as purchasing vehicle. No complaints!
B001GQACGO|5.0|Love this album!!  I can't enough of the Beyonce side, I haven't even listened to the Sasha Fierce side yet.  If you like mellow mood pop, while doing homework or just to whine down from a hectic day, or music to soothe you in the morning before facing chaos, this is side for you.  Favorites of mine right now are \\"Halo\\", \\"Disappear\\" and the oh so beautiful wedding song, \\"Ave Maria.\\" This is the Beyonce I can get use to, B'Day was so superficial, but this is so much softer, loving and human (I'm speaking of the I am....Beyonce side) She's definitely matured in her music. I don't care how everyone else feels, this album to me is her greatest work, I like listening to different styles of music and this album bundles so many genres into one.  Did I mention that I love this album?! LOL! What are you waiting for, go buy it!!!
B00007EDY5|5.0|While it does not regulate voltage for use with older strobes it works very well with modern strobes. It also works with any camera with a hot shoe mount. It is not brand specific.     If you need to add a Sync terminal to a camera that does not have one built in, this device is money well spent.
B001BR5F4C|3.0|Two of my favorite movies. got both for [...] thru amazon. Great deal. But I am not sure this title benefited greatly being put out on blu-ray. Colors look a bit off. You could stick to the DVD on this one.
B001FEA9QU|4.0|First off let me get this right out of the way, Death Magnetic rocks!  It clearly demonstrates that Metallica's passion for heavy music has not diminished over these 20+ years of recording.  In some way this fully completes the bands metamorphosis that began with St. Anger and returns them to their roots musically but retains the \\"fresher\\" and more personal style of lyric writing that James Hetfield has employed since St. Anger.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-- Solo's have returned (Kirk Hammet is better than ever)<br />-- Songs leave room for extended riffs and breaks<br />-- Lars drum sound has improved since St. Anger<br />-- Robert Trujillo is a masterful addition to the band who makes his presence felt all over this record<br />-- First ever appearance of a Piano track on a studio album (it does not suck)<br />-- There is an instrumental on this record, much like Kill'em All, ...and Justice For All, and Master Of Puppets<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-- The mastering/sound quality of this album is awful in places and \\"not bad\\" in others.  \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" sounds worse the longer you listen to it, no matter what media/format you play it on.<br /><br />Overall this is a \\"Neo-Classic\\" Metal album that I am not ashamed to put up their with the likes of \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"...and Justice For All\\".  I consider it a must have for any lover of Heavy music, or a lover of any music for that matter, well maybe not Polka.
B001AQO41E|4.0|\\"Poltergeist\\" is one of my favorite horror pictures and I just introduced my 18-yr-old niece to the film with this blu-ray edition.  She found it very scary and was stunned it was only rated PG (considering the year it was released).  The picture and audio quality of this edition are both wonderful but, as noted by other reviewers, there are no real extras.  Because of all the behind-the-scenes drama I have a feeling it will be a very long time before we see an edition which includes some really meaty extras.  The book was nice, and had a few facts I wasn't aware of (the change from an \\"R\\" rating and the use of real skeletons on set...eww!)<br /><br />Be aware, however, that like all previous versions the really severe edit between the family kitchen and the neighbor's house is still there - I don't think there can be a clean copy anywhere in Hollywood if this is still going on.  I know it supposedly has something to do with Pizza Hut being dissed in the scene, but since it was one line I really think they could've muffled it and kept the complete scene instead of cutting a big chunk.<br /><br />This is a classic, highly entertaining horror movie and well worth watching again.  If you have an older version of the dvd (or even the vhs tape), now is a good time to upgrade it to blu-ray.
B001GQO50I|1.0|This is a CD sourced from a Cassette tape that made it's way into Reels by the Doors people years ago, while the REAL MASTERS TAPES are out there in possesion of the owner Peter Abram, is really sad to see how the Doors label BMA arrange a release of one of the best Doors recordings ever from inferior sources and bootleg material while the Masters are available to be discussed with the ownewr Abram, hopefully they will fix this mess and release the real thing and uncut.  This CD isnt't complete, has effects and clean work added and the saddest is about the inferior source (2nd or 3rd generation) and bootleg material (Kiss the Stone Bootlegs).    Is highly advised to wait to a properly release with the Peter Abram's Master tape uncut, complete and so beautiful sound.
B001GQACGO|3.0|I have been a huge Beyonce fan since Destiny's Child when the original group first came out. She was the most beautiful, had the strongest stage performance and was just the overall breakout person to me...in saying that all of my friends and family know anything with Beyonce on it I am \\"all over it\\" because she is my girl and I try to support her...    After I heard \\"If I Were A Boy\\" and \\"Single Ladies\\" I was so excited about this album I couldn't even contain myself I stopped at the store on my way to work on album drop day to purchase it...I put in the \\"I Am\\" side first and waited for that breakout slow song or songs that I would be rocking over and over that day...didn't find one. Because she got married I really thought this side was going to take her album \\"Dangerously In Love\\" to another level on that side with the nice ballads and love songs...but I actually did not find any breakout song besides \\"Halo\\" and \\"Ave Maria\\" and they are still not one of my favorite songs out right now...    So I moved on to the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" side ready to jam at my desk and I enjoyed Single Ladies of course...the Radio song kind of dragged on...then I got to Diva it was a cute catchy song....but after that it was all ballads and I was confused! I thought Sasha Fierce was the party side but I didn't get that and the Scared of Lonely should have been on the \\"I Am\\" side...I listened to both sides back and forth hoping that I would fall in love but I did not...as a die hard Beyonce fan I was extremely disappointed and I understand she wanted to try something new but if anything I wish she would have added more songs to the Deluxe...like 10-12 songs on both cds ---the 8 songs on each cd really feels like its not enough.     It hurts me to the core to write this review because I \\"LOVE\\" everything that Beyonce does but even true and loyal fans should always be honest with their artist and let them know when they have missed the mark and for me she missed the mark and even though she has nice singles I would have to say I really only like 5 songs out of the 16 that she chose. I really hope she goes back to the drawing board and puts out a much better album or I will have to save my money in the future. It pains me as a fan to say this but I want her to keep pushing herself but only if the material is good for us...Bee we love you, but you have to step up your game before Rhianna, Alicia Keys, Keyshia Cole, Ciara, etc...completely take over and leave you completely behind. Don't abandon your fans...
B001GAPC1K|5.0|this is one of the funniest wittiest and most intelligent movies of the summer! gr8 action scenes! buy it!
B001DTPZNY|2.0|The only thing missing from the plot of this movie is the kitchen sink.  Rather than plot, and letting Harrison Ford have his usual sardonic romp, the writers and producers went through their \\"to do\\" lists from previous Indiana Jones movies and threw all that stuff in without regard to whether it moved the plot along, or was even entertaining. The result is a movie bloated with \\"stuff\\" and peopled with actors who are going through the motions and counting the minutes until the camera finally runs out of film.
B0013ND30W|4.0|This is probably my favorite of the classic princess stories produced by Disney because Prince Philip is actually a character and doesn't just ride up at the end to sweep the girl off her feet.  He has his own trials to get through before all ends happily ever after.    This is a beautiful edition on blu-ray and the aspect ratio is a big part of that.  It just looks more sweeping than prior editions.  Color is spot-on throughout, and the audio is lovely.  The fight with the dragon is gorgeous. I haven't had a chance to go through all the extras or the bd-live yet, but I hope to in the near future.      I am also happy to have the standard DVD included so I can watch the movie on other DVD players or let relatives without blu-ray machines borrow it.  I wish more blu-rays included this option instead of just digital copies.    All in all, a beautiful addition to your blu-ray collection.
B000000OU6|3.0|This is an OK CD, if your a Slash fan you'll like it otherwise you may want to pass on it.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|It's fairly obvious to me that the staff at Pixar has sold its souls to de debbil. There's no other way to explain their staggering success, is there? Hard work? Long hours put in? Talent? Creativity? No, man, it's de debbil!<br /><br />Seriously, though, the folks at Pixar Animated Studios - who last I heard haven't actually signed their names in blood or decapitated goats or anything - well, they've done it again. WALL-E is absolutely terrific. In its artistry and emotional richness and its ability to evoke that sense of wonder, this film ranks right up there with Pixar's best.<br /><br />WALL-E is mostly about a wistful robot in love. There's a damning environmental message, sure, and it's impactful yet not all-intrusive. But it certainly forms the premise of WALL-E's world. In the near future, wasteful consumerism has taken its toll on the planet, its by-product of discarded garbage transforming Earth into a toxic global landfill. While a clean-up program is implemented - to render the planet again habitable - Earth's population is temporarily transferred to a massive luxury liner-class starship. Seven hundred years later, they're still on the ship.<br /><br />Robots aren't supposed to feel loneliness or have dreams and yearnings and such. But, after centuries of quietly toiling away, WALL-E has gone a bit strange, or is the word \\"evolved\\"? WALL-E stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth Class, and our little guy is a rusty, antique trash compactor, designed as one of very many. But he's also equipped with huge, surprisingly evocative binocular-looking eyes, so there's no startlement when we're promptly charmed by him. WALL-E is the last of his kind, and, other than his pet cockroach, is the only creature left inhabiting Earth. Every day WALL-E still does his job, faithfully striving to put order to a messed up planet. It all seems futile.<br /><br />WALL-E has over time become a curious collector of things, knick knacks which to him are mostly of indeterminate nature and function. Man's legacy, as seen thru WALL-E's eyes, consists of bubble wraps, cigarette lighters, egg whisks, and Rubik's Cubes. There are two meaningful items he unearths: a video tape of a film musical. And a little green sprout. WALL-E whiles his evenings away by screening the film and perhaps marvelling at the intimacy portrayed on screen. WALL-E's loneliness only grows.<br /><br />One day, a space ship lands and the sleek, shiny probe EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) emerges and shatters WALL-E's placid existence. EVE's programming directs her to search for signs of ongoing photosynthesis, to see if Earth is again ready to sustain life. But, really, she's there to serve as a romantic foil for WALL-E and an impetus to the plot. Soon, WALL-E finds himself venturing beyond his day-to-day drudgery and into a mad quest for romance. Along the way, he ends up saving humanity.<br /><br />Director Andrew Stanton confesses, in the audio commentary, that in preparation for WALL-E he and his crew viewed plenty of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton silent films. This pays off as, even with the dearth of dialogue in WALL-E, there is an eloquence in the evocation of moods. Much of the storytelling is conveyed thru the film's other elements. Thru lighting, thru the score, and thru the robots' limited expressions and thru their physicality. The first half hour is a wonderful study in minimalism of dialogue, as WALL-E and EVE manage to express depths of meaning merely with how they say each other's names (sound designer Ben Burtt, by the way, who voices WALL-E, is priceless). The two droids' voices may be synthetized, but the soulfulness shines thru. WALL-E reminds me quite a bit of a post-apocalyptic episode from The Twilight Zone, in which Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery are the last two people left on earth, in the aftermath of a devastating war. This episode, poignantly marked with a near absence of dialogue, is titled \\"Two\\" and remains one of my favorite Twilight Zone stories. It's worth noting that Bronson and Montgomery play two soldiers from opposite sides of the war. Okay, back to WALL-E.<br /><br />The film juggles dystopia with hope, and somewhere along the way it finds moments to take wicked digs at greedy consumerism and our over-reliance on technology. 700 years from now, the life of leisure has been taken to extremes. It's a bit disturbing, gazing at the future of humanity, having grown languid and uniformly obese and wholly dependent on hoverchairs for mobility.<br /><br />I'm not into HELLO, DOLLY! (see [[ASIN:B00005JL1P Hello, Dolly! Widescreen Edition]]), but, undeniably, the inclusion of the relentlessly cheery \\"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\\" and the romantic \\"It Only Takes A Moment\\" are pivotal. The opening lyrics to \\"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\\" fits, tongue-in-cheekly: \\"Out there is a world outside of Yonkers...\\" This, even as the camera pans out over the desolate garbage planet.<br /><br />Can one give enough props to the animation department? Pixar's CG stuff is remarkable yet again, and, in spots, even groundbreaking (again). WALL-E and EVE aren't rendered anthropomorphically, not much anyway. But still the animators figure out a way to make them so expressive. WALL-E, that lonely custodial robot, is brought to amazing life on screen. EVE, the streamlined, ovoid-shaped droid, is nearly as endearing. EVE, in fact, has the longer journey to travel, internally. WALL-E is already in that place. EVE has to get past her programming and learn how to be truly alive.<br /><br />What I have is the single disc movie. The bonus features include: an audio commentary by director Andrew Stanton; the hilarious theatrical short \\"Presto\\" - a stage magician and his rabbit have a falling out over a carrot; the all-new original short \\"BURN-E\\" (Remember that robot soldering a lightpost on the ship's exterior? More stuff happens to him); two deleted scenes, with optional intros by the director: \\"Garbage Airlock\\" (same scene as in the movie, except that WALL-E and EVE's roles are reversed, 6:52 long) and \\"Dumped\\" (in the completed film, this scene between WALL-E and EVE and the plant takes place in outer space, 2:38 long); The 18-plus-minute-long featurette \\"Animation Sound Design: Building Worlds from the Sound Up\\" focuses on Ben Burtt and the use of sound design in the film.<br /><br />WALL-E, as is typical with Pixar, caters to all ages. For the young, it's the sheer wonderment of the visuals and the affecting love story. For the young-at-heart, there's the aforementioned stuff, yep, but there are also nuances to savor. And, as this film demonstrates vividly, whatever the age, it's never too late to hold hands with that someone.e of my favorite Twilight Zone stories.

0439023483|4.0|It was a very good book.  The only downside is that the characters built and built and just when it was getting where I really couldn't put it down, it was over.  I didn't realize it was going to be a series.  This one just came out, so now I just have to wait until the next one is done!
B001DHXT1G|4.0|I enjoyed this version of the Hulk and think Edward Norton was a wonderful choice as Bruce Banner.  There was a lot of surprise when they decided to remake this film so soon after the Ang Lee version, but I think it was a great call.  I saw that version as well, but can't really remember much about it!  The majority of people who saw it probably feel the same way - it just wasn't very memorable.    Picture and audio on this blu-ray are wonderful.  The sweeping overhead shot of the rows of housing up the mountainside is spectacularly clear and detailed.  The sound design immerses you in the movie throughout (love the cave sequence during the storm).  This is an entertaining movie with a lot of action and effects, so blu-ray is a perfect medium for it.    Enjoy!
B00005JNQA|4.0|Director Sydney Pollack creates a well-crafted thriller in his film, The Interpreter. Tapping into the global paranoia of a post 9/11 world, the story acts as both a standard political thriller and a rallying call for peace through better communication. The screenplay was written by Charles Randolph, Scott Frank, and Steven Zaillian.    When Silvia Broome, an interpreter for the United Nations, overhears a conversation concerning a plot to kill a controversial political leader from Africa, she is thrust into a dangerous world of international intrigue. When she reports what she's heard, no one believes her. When a government agent named Tobin Keller is assigned to uncover the validity of the potential threat, he at first disbelieves Silvia's story... until she herself becomes a target. Then Tobin, who recently lost his wife in an automobile accident, begins to bond with Silvia, who herself has a tragic past and is very familiar with loss. As it becomes clear that there really is a plot, Tobin and Silvia must rely on one another in order to find out who is behind the conspiracy. But the more that Tobin learns of Silvia's past the more apparent it becomes that it was no coincidence that she overheard the conversation to begin with. Is Silvia involved in the plot or was she targeted from the start? And can Tobin protect her from the many dangers that they now face?    The film stars Nicole Kidman as Silvia Broome and Sean Penn as Tobin Keller. The supporting cast is filled out by Catherine Keener, Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, and Curits l'Cook. Director Pollack also has an uncredited role as Chief Jay Pettigrew. The entire cast gives great performances, and Kidman, in particular, gives a powerful sense of loss and moral confusion.  While the film may not be Pollack's most impressive directorial effort, it is a remarkable written and acted film with some surprising twists. Unlike most thrillers of this kind, the two main characters never consummate their relationship in a sexual manner. Instead the screenplay allows Kidman and Penn to give subtle performances with nuance and believability. What makes The Interpreter so suspenseful is that we, as an audience, are given time to become emotionally invested in the characters as they are tested emotionally, physically, and morally.  Also adding to the believability of the film is the fact that many scenes were actually shot at the United Nations, which had never before allowed a commercial film to shoot within their walls. So in a way, Sydney Pollack has made movie history by earning permission to film there.    The DVD includes an alternate ending, deleted scenes, Sydney Pollack at Work: From Concept to Cutting Room featurette, Interpreting Pan & Scan vs. Widescreen featurette, The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations featurette, and an insightful audio commentary by Pollack.

B00006IUL7|4.0|Christopher Nolan, the acclaimed director of [[ASIN:B0000640SE Following and Memento]], delivers another gripping thriller in his remake of the Norwegian film [[ASIN:6305389519 Insomnia]]. Utilizing his adept understanding of the human psyche, he creates a film that is both haunting and suspenseful. Though it may not keep you lying awake at night, Insomnia will surely keep you on the edge of your seat.    When Detective Will Dormer and his partner, Hap Eckhart are asked to leave behind their native city of Los Angeles to help solve a murder case in a small Alaskan town, they have no idea of the dangers that await them. While in pursuit of a possible suspect Will accidentally shoots and kills Hap, having mistaken him for the suspect. But was it really an accident? Back in L.A. Hap was being asked to testify against Will, who had been using some unorthodox and illegal methods to serve justice. Will reluctantly covers up his role in Hap's death so as to avoid suspicion as to whether or not the shooting was intentional. Now Will is consumed by guilt and is unable to sleep. His insomnia grows more intense, and as he's in part of Alaska where the sun doesn't set for months, he blames his sleepless condition on the light. Yet there are two people who know what's really keeping him awake at night. Ellie Burr, a young and intelligent Alaskan detective, begins to see that Will is clearly disturbed by something and she is compelled to find out what. Meanwhile a strange, reclusive pulp novelist named Walter Finch begins calling Will. Finch says that he witnessed Hap's death at Will's hands, but he won't tell the authorities so long as Will agrees to help him in return. What presents a problem is the fact that Walter Finch is the very murder suspect that Will was pursuing when the accidental shooting occurred. And there can be no denial that Walter Finch is a killer. The two men find themselves forced to work together to conceal their mutual guilt, but when Detective Ellie Burrstarts to uncover the truth, Will is faced with a moral dilemma. Shall he admit his faults, lose his job, and suffer the legal ramifications for what happened in L.A. and for what happened to Hap... or shall he choose to align himself with sociopathic Walter Finch in order to save himself? And what of Ellie Burr, whose youthful enthusiasm and integrity Will has come to respect and admire? Can he protect her from the truth that incriminates him and will inevitably lead her to Walter?    Abandoning the complex narrative structure of his previous film Memento for a more straightforward storytelling style, Nolan manages to maintain a high level of suspense. He also uses numerous visual tricks to keep viewers interested in the conflicts of the characters. As Will Dormer becomes more exhausted the lights become brighter, things seem to move about him without reason, and he begins to experience hallucinations and extreme confusion. What is so remarkable is that, through all of this the viewer is able to follow the sequence of events and differentiate between reality and illusion.  The cast features Al Pacino as Detective Will Dormer, Robin Williams as Walter Finch, and Hilary Swank as Detective Ellie Burr. Not a member of the cast gives a bad performance and each of them manage to hold their own, which is a feat in itself. Hilary Swank, in particular, is great as the young idealistic Ellie Burr. Also adding an unforgettable presence to the film is Robin Williams who creates a truly frightening villain, and yet at the same time he's so charismatic that you almost sympathize with him. As for Pacino, he gives a strong performance but it's nothing that he doesn't normally do on a regular basis.

B001LMRCP2|5.0|If you are a true Coldplay fan then I'm sure you have listened to Viva La Vida so many times that you know all the words. This small collection of songs will be sure to feed your appetite for new Coldplay. The songs here are all amazing and add to the huge collection of awesome Coldplay music. Also the price is amazing. This is almost a full album of songs for half the price. It can't be beat. I especially love \\"Life In Techniolor II.\\" I absolutely love the original and this version adds lyrics to make the sound even better! :)    Bottom Line : Buy this album if you love Viva La Vida and want more amazing Coldplay!!! :)

B000RZIGVS|4.0|I really enjoyed the series when it was originally broadcast. I watched the repeats whenever I got the chance. I think it is one of the best shows and could easily make it on any, \\"top 100 shows,\\" list.<br /><br />It is as entertaining, thought provoking and thoroughly engaging today, as it was back then. The quality of the video and audio of this set, overall, is good.<br /><br />The video does show signs of age, some dirt here and there. There were a few moments where the image was too dark. They could have used a little remastering to clean up the flaws apparent throughout.<br /><br />The audio is clear (5.1 or stereo) and English subtitles are optional. A good choice for any casual or adoring fan of the series.<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />The packaging is very cheaply manufactured. The discs come in three plain book type, flip through style, DVD holders. The holders are held in a plastic book end type case with a flimsy cover.<br /><br />There was no care nor style put into the design of the set or in the labeling of the discs. This is made apparent by the repeated use of the same image of one character spanning several discs in the collection.<br /><br />Also, reading through the reviews, I can understand the complaints made about the packaging and the damage that might have occurred during shipping.<br /><br />One of the holders was chipped on mine and I used some glue to repair it.
0060254920|5.0|This is one of the only books I remember from my childhood. Instead of your typical cutesy little kid story, you have something with real imagination and fun.  It's an original story line with very unique illustrations.  I know many adult artists who still love this book for its artwork.     I used to spend hours studying these illustrations as a child and now I'm a successful artist and I still love them. The point of these illustrations, or rather, any illustration is to supplement imagination, not create it. When I was a child these gorgeous artistic illustrations were far more interesting to me than the typical disney style.  Even as a kid I could appreciate this book for its originality.  Then again, I had imagination of my own, and was able to bring these creatures to life. Kids today have video games to do that for them.     I think people who rate this book as poor just can't see the value in it as art. This is a complete artistic vision executed as both literature and visual art.  I can't see how anyone couldn't like this book unless they have absolutely no imagination, or if they have no appreciation for art whatsoever.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I really don't know what all the fuss is about.  Yes, Perfect Symmetry is quite different from Keane's first two albums, but there's nothing wrong with that.  I've been a fan since I heard the first glorious melodic notes of \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\", and I've loved the dark, evocative quality of their music, but I'm not adverse to change.    When Spiralling debuted I found it refreshing and exciting, as I have with the rest of the album.  I put the CD into my car stereo on October 14 and it's still there now where I listen to it practically every day.  The songs are catchy and toe-tapping and I usually dance (well, as much as you can while sitting down) and sing my way to work, something I never really did with Hopes and Fears or Under the Iron Sea - these two albums are dark, brooding, and wonderful, but they're just not as uplifting as PS.    I don't mind Perfect Symmetry's 80's sound, or that \\"Better Than This\\" starts off sounding a lot like a David Bowie song I know.  \\"Better Than This\\", \\"Spiralling\\", \\"The Lovers Are Losing\\", and \\"Pretend That You're Alone\\" are among my favorite songs on the album, and make me want to break out of my skin and dance.  Then there's the title track \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" and \\"Love Is The End\\", two poignantly beautiful songs that are more like the old Keane.  I like them all.    To put it simply, it's a great album.  Just buy it and find out.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I have purchased The Matrix since it was on VHS.  It is really amazing to see the difference between VHS, DVD and now Blu-ray. The special effects still are fun to watch (especially the vaunted lobby scene).  I loved the first movie but is seems that the path was somewhat lost on the last two.  The last two films are not bad just seem to take a different path than what was originally projected on the first film.  Special effects are over the top as would be expected from the genre. Lots of fun to watch...

B000OY8NII|4.0|Is funny, highly entertaining, dramatic and definitely worth watching. For the fans of Light Sci Fi, is a must.  The package on the other hand is really bad. Is fails to keep the Disks in Place, and is unnecessarily bulky.  3 DVD's, I recommend them.
B0000X61VE|5.0|About 16 years ago I purchased the \\"Cindy Crawford Shape Your Body\\" VHS tape!  It helped me to lose 30 pounds back then.

Of course, it's not as easy this time, I'm 16 years older now!  LOL.  Perfect for someone who wants to have an exercise regimen in her home - great music with it too!
B001LMRCP2|4.0|For $5, you can't beat this.  That is as much as a Starbucks latte.    The songs are a nice addition to the Coldplay repertoire.  Nothing incredibly new or amazing, but they have vocals on Life in Technicolor, which gives that beautiful arrangement new life.    yeah, buy it!
1594201927|4.0|This book is fun to read (a phrase which could well be taken as both praise and criticism). The book provides a great deal on the history of markets, the evolution of financial instruments and periods of crises.  This wealth of historical information is in fact the most worthy aspect of the book.  I also feel that the book's central theme is accurate and timely: Money, banks and innovative financial instruments produce value by improving the efficiency of financial intermediation. This point needs to be appreciated today in the face of populist attacks on banks in response to the current crisis. (My own view is that the current crisis is a failure of regulation and not inherently the fault of the complicated derivative products that many criticize.)           The style of writing is neither academic nor rigorous. For a lay reader that, of course, may well be a plus. But on the other hand, if one is looking for an in depth analysis of our current crisis or indeed some substantive proposals to lead us out of the crisis, you will not find it here. An underlying theme of the book, however, does ring loud and true. All economic activity is fundamentally based upon confidence. The only solution to the current crisis is to re-establish market confidence.      All in all the book is a great read and is quite informative.
0452289963|5.0|I have read this book three times since I bought it. Each time I get new ideas from it. For anyone who wants a life that is more fulfilled, who wants to contribute to the world in expanded ways, or who wants to step out of sadness or loss, this is the book.    After I read A New Earth I went back and purchased Tolle's previous book, The Power of Now.[[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]] It was a good read, but in A New Earth his concepts have matured, his descriptions are sharper, and he brings it all home in a more personal way. Read it with an open mind and a willingness to be honest with yourself and it will be powerful.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|In late 2007 Jeff Beck played several shows at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London and he awed and enthralled the audiences with his searing, exquisite and ethereal guitar virtuosity. He's a complete master of the fretboard and whammy bar whose guitar can sound angelic and then suddenly thunderous. Many of his most riveting and agressive songs were played including \\"Becks Bolero,\\" \\"Big Block,\\" Brush With The Blues\\" and the intense \\"Scatterbrain.\\" His eastern influences also resonated on wonderful songs such as \\"Nadia\\" and the psychedelic \\"Blast From The East.\\" Jeff Beck's most tender and complex songs really impressed the audience and UK music critics. Examples are \\"Angel (Footsteps,)\\" Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\" and the inimitable \\"Were Were You.\\" Beck's majestic rendition of the Beatles' \\" A Day In The Life\\" is utterly captivating and it has rightfully won a 2010 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. \\"Led Boats\\", \\"Behind The Veil\\" and \\"Stratus\\" are also spellbinding highlights on this flawless all instrumental CD. Jeff Beck can literally coax, caress and strangle a universe of sounds from his guitar without using hardly any effects.     Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour, Brian May and Tom Scholz have all declared that Jeff Beck is the greatest solo guitarist. This CD verifies their erudite assertions.

1433502410|4.0|There is a lot to like about the ESV Study Bible. It brings a wealth of mostly sound and up-to-date evangelical scholarship together, often with a distinct conservative and Reformed flavor. Needless to say, this Bible is rather bulky and the font of the study notes is quite small; such is the price of combining a mass of information in one volume.     There is one thing I don't like about this Bible, and it is costing it a star. All the contributors who have written articles or study notes are male. With 95 such contributors, this has to be deliberate. The promotion material states: \\"The contributors come from 9 countries, representing nearly 20 denominations and more than 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities\\" - but only one gender. I have only found two women listed among those who have worked on this study Bible (assuming I have correctly assessed gender in all cases), and they deserve to be mentioned by name: Sherah Grose, \\"Assistant to the Project Director\\" (and therefore not a threat to male supremacy, I suppose) and Monica Gee, \\"Bible Production Coordinator\\", whatever that means.    The study notes to controversial passages like 1 Corinthians 14 and 1 Timothy 2 indicate this Bible takes a clear anti-Egalitarian position. On numerous debatable issues such as a late or early date for the exodus, the meaning of the millennium in Revelation 20, and the overall approach to the book of Revelation, this Bible presents an overview of the main evangelical positions. This is what I expect of a good commentary or study Bible; it should do justice to the spectrum of evangelical opinion. It is very unfortunate that the ESV Study Bible does not do this when it comes to the issue of women in the church.    There can be no doubt: this is a male study Bible.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|When I first saw the move \\"Mamma Mia!\\" advertised I wanted to see it.  I don't go to the theater much anymore, I rent movies all the time, but I called my daughter and made a date with her to go.  We LOVED it!  It swept us away from all our troubles, gave us a good laugh, and made us want to get up and DANCE in the aisles!  When the movie ended everyone in the theater applauded out LOUD and exited with a huge SMILE on their faces.  I will definitely buy this one for myself, my daughter, and my two daughters-in-laws.  Meryl Streep really suprised and delighted us with her performance, as well as Pierce Brosnan.  We need more musicals like this in our lives.  HIP HIP HURRAY!!!

B001EO2UJK|1.0|Jeff Carney's review hits the nail on the head. The music of Genesis golden era has been compressed down to appease the iPod generation. There are literally no dynamics left in this music...and just because they didn't use brickwall limiting to push the level to the ceiling (this time) does not mean it wasn't compressed to death along the way. A signal can still be compressed without it's makeup gain being cranked up. There are no peaks and valleys left in the waveforms. It's all basically the same volume! That's why you hear all those little nuances you couldn't hear before. But you know what....that is nothing like real, live music! It's fake. It's processed. It's fast food. Without dynamics, it's unexciting, unmusical and just plain boring. If you like these simply because they're *louder*...try finding the original versions Jeff speaks of and turning your stereo UP. There's a concept. Once you hear what excitement and realism, dynamics in music brings...you'll be using these as coasters.

B000I0QM04|5.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is loud, noisy, silly, unbelievably ridiculous, and it's one of the most fun experiences I've had watching a movie in the past six months!  This is a movie that whisks the audience off into a long forgotten era of filmmaking that I for one am grateful to see it put back on screen with the advancements of today's technology.  I was just amazed that anyone would actually have the nerve to go back into the realm of camp, and cheese of the old shows and actually try and take it seriously (I don't mean the actual movie, for it is very tongue-in-cheek).<br /><br />This is fun for the entire family; the action will entertain children and the visuals will entertain older audiences, especially ones who are fans of old movies and serials.  This movie has lots to offer as popcorn entertainment, and I was entertained throughout.  I loved the way New York City looked, and I loved their jungle homage to the original \\"King Kong\\" towards the end of the film.  This film just is all visuals, and for the most part they're all good, and I never once felt the film overstayed its welcome.<br /><br />The movie is set between World Wars I and II (though the advanced technology won't have you believing that for a second) and starts off with a story about scientists who have started to mysteriously disappear.  Soon we find New York City under siege by giant robots that fly into action with their arms spread out straight and then start to lumber up and down the streets (They look like they flew out of \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\").  Events like this apparently happen quite frequently judging by the looks of things and the people are quick to call their hero Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), or as they call him Sky Captain, a man who flies around in an airplane and seems to fight against to forces of evil with his own private air force, complete with science lab and Bond-style gadgets built into his plane.<br /><br />Bad things are happening worldwide, and the authorities are balled.  Who could be doing this?  Leave it to Sky Captain to find out these events are orchestrated by the evil German scientist Dr. Totenkopf, who wants to retrieve two cylinders which were given to Joe's obsessive reporter ex-girlfriend, Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), and soon the two of them are put together in an adventure to stop Totenkopf from destroying the world!  Along the way they're thrown into a serious of ridiculous action sequences, or moments where you expect to see the screen freeze and bold letters surface stating \\"Too be continued...\\" This is all part of the fun that is \\"Sky Captain.\\"  This movie knows it's ridiculous, and that's the entire point, which it exploits whenever possible.<br /><br />Giovanni Ribisi is Sky Captain's gadget supplier, and is obviously inspired by Q from the orginal Bond films and Angelina Jolie also shows up as a sexy British pilot (Her British accent really hasn't improved that much since \\"Tomb Raider\\") in charge of a massive flying airstrip, which utilizes one of the most fun, if not most unbelievable designs in the entire movie.  Robots and flying airbases are only a few of the unbelievable, yet fun creations you get exposed to during this movie.  Everyone on the special effects team of this film must have had a lot of fun!<br /><br />The film is shot almost entirely with blue-screen and that gives the filmmakers lots of freedom with their visuals.  They could've gone overboard with this, but I feel they took it just far enough to capture the idea of the old serials and movies, and it all looked very nice on Blu-Ray.  I love this little effect they do that fades to colors to make it look like an old film.<br /><br />I just really like the feel of this film.  The actors know this is ridiculous, they know it's absurd, and they obviously have a lot of fun with the whole thing.  They could've played it to death giving winks to the audience, but they never do.  They act serious, but with an underlying message that they know what they're doing is silly.  They find a fine ground between campy and too serious, and just make this film very good as homage to those long forgotten films.<br /><br />The thing that got me was that in an age of serious films where we typically have emotionally confused heroes, and incredibly serious plots Director Kerry Conran actually went through with making a movie that paid homage to the movies, and serials of the 1930s-1950s.  Every character, every set piece, prop, and robot seems to have walked out of that early age of entertainment, and in my opinion the industry was in serious need of a retrieve from the barrage of serious films and a look back into a simpler time.<br /><br />This movie was an escape for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love serious movies, but I feel we need some movies like \\"Sky Captain\\" every now and then to help even out the industry, or else we may become too serious.  I don't want every movie I see to reflect the gritty horror that is reality and would like to every now and then escape back to childhood daydreams of airplanes that convert into submarines and where every character is clean cut, being really good or really bad.<br /><br />For people who enjoy special-effects or the old serials of the 1930s-40s \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is a must, or even for the people who enjoy the original James Bond films where just about anything seems possible.  This is Grade-A, no brain entertainment at its finest!is silly.  They find a fine ground between campy and too serious, and just make this film very good as homage to those long forgotten films.

B0017M8XS6|1.0|I agree with Jeff's review below. The sound on this thing is horrific. It's mega-compressed and overly bright. The more they mess with this album. the worse it sounds. Go back and find the original Atlantic version...crank up your stereo...and enjoy the *dynamics* of the music.

B001HDO4Z6|5.0|I've been an avid fan of Coldplay since A Rush of Blood to the Head, but never did I think they would become something too beautiful for words. Truly, if you haven't heard any of their music after X&Y, you will be completely surprised.     As a historian, musician, and rather open-minded person, I've found both Viva La Vida and Prospekt's March to be absolutely fantastic works of art. There's a story here. Listen to Violet Hill, and then listen to Prospekt's March. Take in the music, but don't forget the history behind it. Figuring out exactly what they're talking about is one of the most exciting things in the world. I won't spoil it here.    As for the new tracks on Prospekt's March, well, they're not new. They're leftovers from Viva La Vida, which is actually a great thing. These songs won't be left to the depths of history and never heard again.     1. Life in Technicolor ii is perhaps even better than the original. Why Chris axed it is a mystery to me.    2. Postcards from Far Away: A short piano session, but beautiful in its sound. It really reminds you of a postcard or connection from a distant place.    3. Glass of Water: Epic. The buildup is fantastic. I won't even try to explain it here.    4. Rainy Day: Somewhat similar to Viva la Vida in its use of some orchestral instruments. Very varied. It's like a hundred things are happening at once, and the lyrics go well.    5. Prospekt's March: In sound, opposite of Violet Hill. In lyrics, possibly one of the most beautiful songs in recent times.    6. Lost+: Nothing new here, you could've gotten this weeks ago from the Lost EP. It's the remix with Jay-Z; while it doesn't sound that bad, it's not crazy or anything. Good effort by them to branch out, though.    7. Lovers in Japan (Osaka Mix): Basically, Lovers in Japan without the ending piano session. Also, this song was mastered slightly differently, as Chris's voice is further and various instruments are closer. If anything, it sounds more like the music video.8. Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground: Somewhat reminds me of Til Kingdom Come, but still an amazing song nonetheless. A good finish for an EP.    Overall, it's not a completely different beast. It's just a great addition to an already amazing line.    Heartily recommended.
0307269752|5.0|Alright, you've heard the hype, here's the story. Really good, like chocolate cake for breakfast good. The pace is quick and the characters are multi-dementional. The plot is, nearly perfect. It's a mystery that won't necessarily keep you guessing, but you won't care. The story is not the mystery. The mystery is the backdrop for the characters to play in. And you will love the characters. p.s. book 2 in the series is released in US in Aug. 09. but in UK in Jan. 09 - Amazon.co.uk delivers!

It is very well written..a 'page turner'   and truly shocking about what it reveals the U.S. the IMF and the WORLD BANK have done around the world since the '70s causing immense suffering and bloodshed in  forcing poor countries to have 'FREE MARKETS\\"       I have already given away 11 copies and just bought 5 more to give away.      It's a MUST READ if you want to understand our current economic problems.

0375826726|3.0|I thought this was to be the last book of the \\"trilogy\\" but nope, it's now a cycle.  It took me to the last couple chapters to realize that it was going to be hard to wrap up, pretty frustrating.  I hope the next book doesn't take so long to be released.  I questions the author's motives for not ending it with this book.  He claims it's because there is so much more to write about, but could it be that there is so much more money to be made with another book.  The story itself is intriguing and it leaves you wanting more.

0887307876|5.0|What can I say? Scott Adams has been revealing the \\"Real-Life-In-The-Office\\" for a long time and with great success. I have been reading his daily comics (in Canada) religiously. This book covers --and uncovers--many harsh and unpleasant facts about the wild-and-crazy world of the office business wonderfully well.

0439023483|3.0|I thought this was a riveting read... until the old cliffhanger ploy. At least if you're going to do that... mention it in the beginning - and have the next volume ready.    I really didn't like the way it left it. Instead of wrapping up the whole ordeal and making us wonder 'what's next?' it just made me angry with Catnip!!!
031606792X|2.0|Book three should have ended with the honey moon and Edward making her a vampire. Something like \\"I'll see you when you wake up\\" right before the bite. Everything that followed the honey moon was just too much and too...disgusting. When she said \\"I think I'm pregnant\\", I almost threw the book across the room. She's what?  Are you serious?  At the end, Meyer made the mistake that so many authors make...she introduced new characters. Far too many characters. She even had to put in a characters list in the back so the we could keep it together. the whole book leads up to a battle that doesn't happen. Bella's change is so un-extraordinary that it makes us wonder why we ever cared about her being turned. All the superpower abilities turn the book into a farse. Is living forever and being able to lift cars not super enough for Meyer? And the Volturi?  Meyer really had something going with the whole \\"normal vampire\\" thing. They're just regular people who happen to drink blood, but when she started on this Volturi stuff, she became Anne Rice all over again.
B001ED7C58|5.0|When I first listened to the soundtrack I thought is was good.  But as I listened more and more I fell in love with each song.  The soundtrack has a little of everything.  So good.  Just hit repeat when it's finished.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I'm really torn about this album... Shall I like it or not?     It is raw, fast and definitely reminding me about the early Metallica, the one I came to love. However, in comparison with the Kill'em all - Master of Puppets era, many of these songs just seem way too \\"thick\\" and too long for how heavy they are. I think that's partly because the mix sounds \\"very close\\". They had more hall in the stated early albums, making the heavy sound more atmospheric and easier to deal with. On DM, the sound of the fast songs actually makes me tired in a way that I'm relived, once the song ends. That's not good!    Melodies are here, but they don't stick in my mind as long as those on the above stated albums. Good to hear Kirk making solos again, but since a couple of years he's been using that wah-pedal way too much for my taste live, and it's the same on that album.     I believe I should just be thankful that these guys still manage to bring out albums with such power and I should just get over the fact that we & them are not in the 80's anymore. I do appreciate Metallica's attitude of making the music they currently feel like doing and that they don't simply play what their fans expect, while still playing for us despite their \\"advanced\\" age and wealth.    My dream would still be that the next album would sound like a mix of their first 3 albums, but I guess this just ain't possible (anymore). To me, one of the biggest unanswered questions ever really is: how would Metallica sound today if Cliff was still here?
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This film is an over-the-top-hyper-real-simulucra of madness. It is also a complete comedic masterpiece. Think about it: a movie about a movie that was about making a movie based on a book-which happens to be a fraud. There are so many delicious layers of maddeningly convoluted meaning that even the most trained semiotician would prefer dissecting air. Thus, I shan't even try to summarize the plot. Rather, I will let the reader of this review enjoy the pleasure. As an avid watcher of films such as Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, etc., I could not help but notice the crazy pastiche and satire. From start to finnish, this film is hillarious. Bravo to Mr. Stiller.<br /><br />As a postscript, I think if there were any justice in this world that Robert Downey Jr. would win the Oscar for his amazing performance. His acting is absolutely brilliant. Honestly, Heath Ledger's Joker has nothing on Downey's Lazarus.<br /><br />Brilliant!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Better than her 1st album, if that's possible. She is in constant development in both lyricist and arranger abilities. All songs are great, and Fiona defined the feeling of the late 90s.<br /><br />On the Bound is a sensational song, with extreme power and depth. The production is high level, and her voice delivers exactly what we expect from the mood of the song.<br /><br />She is a true artist, label that is given so easily by the media these days, to the so called \\"talents\\". But not with Fiona, she deserves all acclamation that she got, and much more.<br /><br />This is a true masterpiece of modern intelligent music!
0312360266|3.0|At first, when I started reading this book, it completely bored me.  The story line consisted of fluff, and was obviously copied from other popular series.  The characters were boring, and unoriginal.  The first few chapters were HORRIBLE.  However, I forced myself to read this book because I kept thinking it would get better.  Towards the middle-end of the book, it started getting better.  The writers seemed to have realized that readers needed more substance and kicked it up a notch. The characters started getting depth and originality to them. It actually got interesting and I no longer had to force myself to read the book.  I finished it fairly quickly because it had started to get better.    Even though I did not like the book at first, all in all, it wasn't too bad of a read.  After reading the whole book, I would say that I liked it, despite the beginning of the book. It is very short, and could have used a couple more hundred pages; some parts seemed really rushed.   I would recommend his to anyone who wants to explore different types of books. (I am not a fan of sci fi/fantasy at all but wanted to branch out..) If you are serious and don't want to waste your time, I would def. not recommend this book to you.    I thought the first book was good enough to buy the second. I really hoped that the last half of the book was an indication that the writing and characters were getting more complex. After reading the second, and third books, I can now say that I actually am fond of the books.  I am glad I stuck through the first book because the other books in the series are WAY better, and def. worth reading.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|Funny, funny Funny, Anyone who has worked in a \\"cubicle\\" atmosphere has to get this DVD. !
B001KO3FFW|5.0|This Album is Brillant because it is the First professionally produced album by this Artist and there are no SKIPS on the album. There is something for everyone, Pop, Rock, Power Ballads.(you will sing,dance and cry) The Album is full of \\"Energy and Passion\\" the more you listen the more hooked you become. The single \\"Light On\\" is good but many of the other songs are better. Cook has been compared to Daughty, Lifehouse, Nickelback and I would say to Cook, \\"Take It\\" those are comparisons anyone would want. Those of us who have followed DC know his talent and his \\"Unique Voice\\" and ability to write and play music he is a \\"Gift\\"!  If you don't own it \\"DEFINITELY BUY\\" it how often do you find a Rock/Pop Album with no Skips?
B000002BE9|4.0|This is Fiona's first album. Although not yet fully developed, her talent was already impressive here.<br /><br />Criminal was a big hit, but the album is great all the way, with nice and easy listening songs all through it. Her voice blends so perfectly with the piano chords and Brion's producing is high quality. The band that plays on it is also extremely professioanl.<br /><br />And let's face it, how many real talented women do we have nowadays singing rock? By far my favourite female voice!

B000X5SPBI|4.0|Season three was only disappointing in that it was shorter due to the writer's strike.  It was funny, heartbreaking and thrilling as always.  I loved the role reversal this season with Sam trying to save Dean and Dean showing his softer side and admitting his fear about going to hell.  As a huge fan of the series I was not disappointed with the direction the show is going and looking forward to season 4.  To me, the show is only getting better.  This was a worthwile purchase.  I do wish there were more special features on these disk but I guess you can't have it al.

B000SFJWLU|5.0|I usually don't get into the whole \\"growling\\" type of metal (death metal? I'm not sure). I can never understand the lyrics, and the growling usually interferes with the music.    5FDP has the growling, but it works really well. You can hear the lyrics clearly, and it definitely doesn't interfere with the actual music. The vocalist has a nice range, switching between growling and singing nicely. The music is a pure \\"punch\\" to the face. Oh my god. I haven't been this excited about a metal album in a long time. I'm 41 years old, and I had begun to think metal was dying out (again!). But there are some good upcoming bands out there, and 5FDP has to be in this group.     My favorites: The Way of the Fist, The Bleeding, Can't Heal You, Never Enough. These are the ones I listen to most, but the whole album really kicks a$$. There's not a weak track on here; even the acoustic version of The Bleeding is pretty cool. This album is not for the faint of heart, which is just the way a good metal album should be.

Dire Straits has some other great songs, but this is their only CD I put on regularly and listen though to almost the end.  Some really great lyrics in here \\"She tortures taxi drivers just for fun - she just let a big truck crease her hip\\" or \\"Oh, Romeo, yeah I used to have a scene with him.\\" Give it a try.
1577314808|2.0|This book is not for anyone who is below a certain echelon of spiritual enlightenment, which is relatively high.  It can induce a veiled apathy which is dangerous towards the true lessons learned in one's life.      It is almost nihilistic in its attitude towards reality, this guy is RATHER egotistical, and although I do not doubt his spiritual path, he fails to see the VAST variety of paths which one can choose towards enlightenment.  Save your money.

B00000K0E5|5.0|This 1995 movie is the first of 4 Bond films that starred Pierce Brosnan, and by far, I believe his best.  This is also the 18th Bond (if you include Never Say Never Again).<br /><br />I tend to favor Pierce as my favorite 007 because he has the wit and sex appeal that I feel Bond should have.<br /><br />This movie begins with a stunt that only Bond could do---bungy cording down a dam.  It makes it special because they used Hoover Dam (near where I reside) as the location.  They had to insert trees and vegetation, because we all know that you can't find that in the Mojave desert.  I just moved here when they filmed this scene and I remember it being on our news.<br /><br />Bond does everything right again and saves the world from Russian nuclear weapons.  With this you get a very action packed adventure, complete with gadgets, car chases, beautiful scenery and the whole wonderful Bond package.<br /><br />While Daniel Craig has taken over as the new agent 007, nothing can replace Pierce, but Craig (I know) will continue to do an excellent job.<br /><br />This version plays so good on a 5.1 surround sound system, it makes you feel like you were there in the midst of the action.<br /><br />Watch this movie. Sit back and relax as it is Pierce's best Bond film and one of my top favorites.

0684803356|5.0|Hemingway's novel \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (1940) is toughly realistic in its depiction of the butchery of warfare.  The book has the no-nonsense, fact-intensive style of a reporter. Yet, in its themes of love, death, heroism, and human brotherhood, Hemingway's novel is, in spite of itself, romantic in outlook, but romantic with an edge.<br /><br />The novel is set in Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).  The Spanish Civil War was a multi-sided conflict between the democratically-elected government, the Republicans or loyalists, and its right-wing anti-communist opponents, the nationalists (fascists). The Republicans during this conflict had the assistance of the USSR.  Their enemies, the nationalists, were assisted by Nazi Germany and by Italy. Hemingway was a correspondent in Spain at the time.  His novel tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American instructor in Spanish at the University of Montana who had earlier spent much time wandering through Spain. In 1936, with the outset of the conflict, Jordan volunteered his services to assist the Republicans and became an expert in explosives. Jordan idealizes his grandfather who had been a hero in the American Civil War.  Jordan's father had committed suicide.  When the novel opens, Jordan is assigned to destroy a bridge in furtherance of a Republican offensive. He works with a group of guerrillas in the mountains.<br /><br />The story unfolds over a time of three days. Hemingway's book offers portrayals of a group of Jordan's Spanish compatriots, in addition to Jordan himself.  Chief among them is a 48-year old woman, Pilar, physically unattractive, earthy, and strong-willed.  She is the de facto leader of her group and is as central to the story as is Jordan. Pilar is the \\"woman\\" of Pablo, who was once a formidable fighter but who has become disillusioned by the conflict.  The novel includes several scenes of high tension and near violence between Jordan and Pablo. In his efforts to blow-up the bridge, Jordan is assisted by Anselmo, an aged man who despairs of violence and killing but is devoted to the Republican cause.  And, in the three days of the novel, Jordan meets and has a passionate love affair with Maria, a lovely 19-year old who has been saved from the nationalists by Pablo.<br /><br />Hemingway is known for a terse, elliptical writing style, and it is on display in this book.  But the writing is highly varied, with long stream of conscious digressions by Jordan as he reflects upon his past life and upon the conflict in which he has thrust himself. Much of the writing is both figurative and digressive. Hemingway tried to transcribe much of Spanish idiom directly into English, particularly the use of \\"thou\\" for the intimate Spanish \\"you.\\" He also makes considerable use of untranslated Spanish phrases. The book captures the speech patterns of soldiers under tension, with much use of colorful language.  Hemingway does not reproduce this language directly but, in English, uses phrases such as \\"obscenity\\" or \\"unprintable\\" in place of the words themselves.  In addition to telling the story of the bridge and its destruction, all the characters engage in long discussions of their thoughts and their prior lives.  These discussions generally are directed to the brutality of the war.  In an outstanding passage, Pilar tells of the destruction under the command of Pablo of a group of fascist leaders who are forced to run the gauntlet before being thrown down a cliff.<br /><br />Hemingway was in love with Spain, both for its beauty and its brutality.  The novel has many discussions of bullfighting, largely told by Pilar as she recounts her experiences with earlier lovers.  Pilar also has a power of clairvoyance in the story, especially as it relates to impending death.  The book includes several vivid battle scenes. One of these scenes tells of the gunning-down by aircraft of a group of five of the guerillas assisting Jordan at the top of a small hill.(Aircraft has a large and fearsome presence in the book.) Another effective battle scene tells of the difficult destruction of the bridge and its aftermath.<br /><br />The love relationship between Robert Jordan and Maria comes to dominate the novel. The two become passionately attracted to each other and quickly consummate their relationship.  The passages describing the couple's lovemaking are central to the story and effective. The inhumanity of war is juxtaposed against human commitment and the beauty of the everyday. Robert Jordan realizes that he is in love with Maria, Spain, and with life. This love, in the book, reaches its peak in heroism and self-sacrifice.  Jordan comes to realize what in life he values.  It is because of his realization, that he ultimately must give up the things he comes to cherish.  Within its language of toughness and machismo, this novel has the theme of inevitability and of romantic tragedy.<br /><br />This is a book I read in high school many years ago when it was far beyond me. It is not an easy book, and not every part of it is successful. But it is an extraordinary novel. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to revisit the book when I was able to try to appreciate it.<br /><br />Robin Friedmane presence in the book.)

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Yes, this release sounds much like other of Enya's releases, but that's very much a positive comment.  I wouldn't consider it a Christmas CD only because you could easily swap tracks from earlier works into this effort and swap out songs into earlier CD's and have essentially lost nothing in the change; however, it gets five stars because it's Enya and none of the magic is lost in this latest release.

B00133KDM8|4.0|Fans of Sarah Brightman or Renaissance's Annie Haslam will find a lot here.  Tarja Turunen is the former singer of Nightwish, a Finnish band reminiscent of a Goth-oriented Trans-Siberian Orchestra.  On this solo outing, Tarja drops much of the dark crunch of the Nightwish sound, instead embracing an icy symphonic sheen on which to lay her semi-operatic vocals.  No, she hasn't gone all Enya on you - her fiery cover of Alice Cooper's \\"Poison\\" begs for volume at 11.  But the production surrounding her powerful vocals typically includes fuzz-drenched power chords, clouds of real strings and woodwinds, and choirs raising the roof in soaring harmonies or percussive, Carmina-Burana-esque clips, as well as minor-key interludes for breathing space.  Eighteen songs comprise three distinct suites - this is not an album to be sampled in little bits.  \\"Sing for Me\\" is the majestic, northern-lights showcase of an album whose angst-laden, Wagnerian fantasy is perfect for those dark, midwinter nights.
0307269752|5.0|This isn't the sort of book I would normally read, but after hearing a very positive review, I decided to try it.<br /><br />The author sets the stage for the drama by describing the lives of the main characters: Pressed flowers being sent anonymously to a wealthy aging industrialist; a crusading journalist taken down by a libel suit; a young woman whose boss sees her as a talented private investigator and a disfunctional enigma.<br /><br />From there we watch as the author creates a clever story about murder, abuse, and the dark side of Sweden using these people and the people around them. The journalist is coerced into taking a job offered by the industrialist to find out who murdered the industrialist's niece, a girl who disappeared 40 years earlier. The dysfunctional PI becomes the journalist's assistant in the search. As the two of them get closer to the truth, new twists are discovered and the tension continues to get ratcheted up.<br /><br />As I got further into the book, I found myself thinking about it when I was busy doing other things, wishing I could read a little more. I finally got up early one morning to finish it, and since then, have been wishing I hadn't. Not because I didn't like the ending, but because I wanted more. I immediately got online to see when the next book in the series would be released.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|Taylor Swift declines on this record from her debut album.  The songs here are unremarkable, rather bland, some almost boring.  This album is acceptable more as background music than as something you'll pull out and listen to the songs for the lyrics.  The fun and creativity of the debut album just aren't present on this one.  So 3 stars, which is my ranking for \\"average.\\"  Fortunately, Taylor is only just going to turn 19 so she has time to recoup.  Hope she does.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|I grew up watching Speed Racer after school.  I was not sure what to expect from this movie, but all I can say is that it gave me goosebumps at times - especially the subtle music cues.  Sure it's a bit cartoonish - but that's the point.  My only problem with the movie is that for some silly reason, they decided to have Spritle 'flip the bird' which doesn't fit with the overall tone of the movie - otherwise I would be showing this to my kids right now.

B0013K1ALE|4.0|For the longest time if you were a Zeppelin fan this was your only chance to catch a glimpse of them live, and even then you had to wait to see it at a midnight movie.   OK, I'm showing my age and I know I'm being a little nostalgic. Sure, the fantasy sequences are a little cheesy and even then, we noticed that sometimes Jimmy's hand's weren't syncing up quite right with the music but it didn't matter, this was Zeppelin live! Anyway, they've remastered the soundtrack, the picture looks a lot better and the second disc of extra footage makes it essential. If you're a fan, you either have it already or you need this.

B001HDO4Z6|5.0|After their massively successful, and amazingly good, \\"Viva La Vida,\\" Coldplay found themselves with leftovers from their recording sessions. So, just in time for the holidays, Coldplay gives us their musical gifts in this tight EP, complete with new tracks, remixes, and new versions of old favorites.<br /><br />But let me first say that this album cannot be compared to \\"Viva La Vida\\" in quality with the new tracks. The great production values are still there, but they simply don't match up to the standards of 'Viva.' It wasn't until the third listen that the quality of the songs really started to shine on their own. They're still not 'Viva,' and it's probably best that they were left off, but they're still great songs in their own right. From the completed \\"Life In Technicolor,\\" or the new \\"Glass of Water,\\" each new track has something to give. Coldplay also goes purely acoustic on \\"Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground,\\" which surprisingly works from the sometimes over-produced band.<br /><br />However, there are some questionable tracks on here. Mainly the \\"Lost\\" remix, featuring Jay-Z, which sounds like Justin Timberlake's \\"Until the End of Time,\\" with Beyonce just implanted over the song. It adds absolutely nothing, and the rapping is bad. Sorry Jay-Z, you got lost in there somewhere. \\"Lovers in Japan\\" is also supposed to be a remix, but there is no noticeable difference between it and the original. It's placement on the album therefore is rather mystifying.<br /><br />Overall, if you loved \\"Viva La Vida,\\" or you're just a fan of Coldplay, then pick the album up. Clocking in at a little under half an hour, the EP has songs that shine apart from the main album, which is what the best EPs do; provide a home for good songs that don't really fit anywhere else. And that's exactly what this EP does, even with a couple of misfires.<br /><br />Real Score: 4.5
0810979772|5.0|My son LOVES this book since I bought it for him he can't put it down & can't wait to get a new one!! I think it really brings out the creative thinking in kids, he has always loved reading but never liked writing much, this book is a great combination of both!! He is only 8 and has no problem with this but  he is a high achiever in reading also.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|This is, to use an overused term, a must-see documentary. Moore powerfully shows how bad the U.S. health care system is at this time. He shows how different (and) better things are in European countries with \\"socialized\\" medicine. If Sicko doesn't convince you that we need health care reform nothing will. Having said this, I disagree with Moore's sanguine view of Cuba's health care system. The World Health Organization actually rates Cuba's system as worse than ours. Notwithstanding this criticism, I highly recommend Sicko.
B000YKE87W|5.0|Yes he is the living end.  Really.  A gorgeous sound and amazing technique.  And if you think this cd is good, go and see him in person.  You won't believe it, for he is even better live, smooth as silk and phenomenal in performance. You will be swept away!!!
B001ESYAJY|3.0|Let me start by saying that I am a big David Arold fan; he has been excellent for the Bond movies and has captured and built on sound styles that go back to John Barry but improved them by making more exciting music and more complex pieces; he also does the slow stuff extremely well in the same Bond genuine flavor. That said, I am baffled at the stingy use of the JB Theme in this film and that goes with my disappointment with the movie itself which was edited and filmed in a ton of tight close shots and fast edits that robbed the viewer of a clean sense of the action and plot. The director presumably dominated Arnold by asking for minimal use of the JB Theme and the fact many movie scenes jumped around horribly also made the music have to accomodate that with many shifts from fast to slow the fast and so on. The theme song also is messy so Arnold could not adapt parts of it well for use in other parts of the film. The soundtrack music is the best thing about the movie (and I criticize the filewith the note that I am a tremendous fan of the Bond movies, so noting that this blockbuster was an expensive waste of what might have been a good Bond flick gives me no joy). If you like Arnold via Tomorrow Never Dies, World is Not Enough and Die Another Day, you will find some things to enjoy in the Quantum of Solace soundtrack but recognize that what is good in this current album is probably good for true fans only; if you are looking for an album that is more typical and has the JB Theme in it - try Tomorrow Never Dies instead of this one or go back to the beginnings and buy a copy of Goldfinger.
0783229526|5.0|It's good. I enjoy it. A lot. That is, I enjoy it more than a little. It's good. Funny. Rather humorous. I recommend it.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I saw this movie 15 times with different friends and family.  I loved it... poo poo to the critics.  This film leaves you happy and singing.  I saw the broadway show and my husband and I were on our feet the last 15 minutes clapping and singing.  This movie is what it is... a feel good happy film.  And thats how you leave the theatre.
B00004U45G|5.0|Jimmy Page & The Black Crowes were simply amazing that night at the Greek ! What can I say, they honored Led Zeppelin's arrangements, musicianship and excitement, with AXE MAN EXTRAORDINAIRE Jimmy Page in great shape !

B001C3KCSY|5.0|Recently my sister was able to travel from Canada to Seattle to see Kings of Leon, and based off of the strength of Only By The Night, I wish I could have gone with her. The Followill's are new to me, but after hearing \\"Sex On Fire\\", I had to find the source of this distinct blues pop fusion. And find it I did, in Only by the Night, KOL's fourth album (clearly I've missed a lot).     I was taken by the distinctive and refreshing sound of this band. \\"Closer\\" begins with a haunting, subdued build-up, leading into an eerie display of vocal angst as the singer emotes the suffering of a lovesick vampire. After the warmup, \\"Crawl\\" picks things up with a curiously familiar dominating riff and a politically charged lyrical theme. Politically it is an intelligent song that peppers in some interesting religious doctrine. Very topical and rather smart if I may say so myself.    \\"Sex On Fire\\" propels things even further into intensity with its' fast-paced, sexually charged lyrics and screaming passion. Caleb Followill is one of the best vocalists in the business right now. From his angsty inflection to the natural bluesy roughness, it's not something you'll hear on the radio as much these days, and that's a real shame. \\"Use Somebody\\" changes things up a bit with a nice, charming ballad sound. The next song, \\"Manhattan\\", is a curious and unexpected departure from the rest of the record. It has an amazing groove about it, making you want to get up and dance to the infectious beat. The bassline is some of the best stuff from recent memory. This would be an absolute blast to see live.    \\"Revelry\\" is one of the stronger tracks on the record. I found the song just stuck in my head forever. A song like this may not fare well over radio waves but it fits perfectly on Only By The Night. Despite some nice bass work and a couple good hooks, \\"17\\" is on the weaker side as compared to the rest of the record. Gladly things pick right back up with \\"Notion\\", my favorite track on Only By The Night. It possesses an infectious, multi-layered musicality interwoven with some of the smartest lyrics I've heard from these guys. This is without a doubt the catchiest track on the album. The next two songs aren't very inspired or interesting, but fortunately it all ends nicely with the subdued, bluesy ballad \\"Cold Desert\\". The song has a charming sensibility to it, and I thought it a fitting way to end one of the strongest releases of 2008.    I plan on picking up the rest of the band's work. Consider me officially \\"blown away\\".
B00005JPO1|4.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a little less than I had expexted as far as quality and content.
6305428042|5.0|This is a great family movie to watch during the Halloween season.  All ages will enjoy this.  There is some adult humor as well.  We have been renting it for years, and decided to just purchase it so we'd have it.  It's entertaining, and has really good music too.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|Shark is an absolutely enjoyable experience!  This is the kind of lawyer I want if I ever get into trouble.  James Woods is an incredibly good actor.  I've seen most of his movies but Shark has to be the high point of his career.  Next best would be the film \\"Best Seller\\".  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute.
B0001I55SS|4.0|I could watch this movie once a month for the rest of my life and still not be able to figure out why I like it so much. The dialog and acting is laughable and the special F/X are cheesy but the images and cinematography are absolutely beautiful. The exterior shots of the Cygnus are breathtaking and Commander Reinharts control room is fantastic. This is the kind of movie that in some ways looks so good you are willing to overlook its weaknesses. I guess maybe its how I would imagine what it would be like in outerspace even though I know that scientifically much of it would be implausable. I think the biggest problem this movie has is that it could never really figure out its target audience and therefore lacks direction and believability which is such a shame because in the right hands this could have been a very good flick. As it is it is still a guilty pleasure for me and one that I don't take too seriously I can just kill a couple of hours on a late Friday night with a smile on my face.
B00005JPO1|5.0|\\"Crystal Skull\\" is a fitting ending for the Indiana Jones chronicles.  It maintains the magic of the earlier films as well as the humor so necessary to round out the personality of Dr, Jones.  It's too bad that Sean Connery wants to stay retired.  He would have been a super plus to this adventure.  However, bringing Marian Ravenwood (Karen Allen) back to complete the circle, so to speak, was really a master stroke.  You can easily see that the underlying passion between Marian and Indy is still alive and well.  They have each grown as individuals but have always maintained a subtle and unseen connection through the years.  The moment this is evident is when they are tied up in the back of the cargo truck, get free and then Indy climbs through the tarp at the top of the truck.  Marian says something like, \\"I suppose there have been other women in your life since me.\\"  and Indy answers, \\"Yeah, but they all had one problem.  None of them were you.\\"  The look and smile on Marian's face tells it all.  The bond is still there.  Some people may be put off by the hard science at the end of the film - interdimensional travel - for example.  It's best not to panic.  Einstein predicted a multi-dimensional universe and considerable work has been done since his time in expanding on the concept.  For example, some sub-atomic particles seem to have the ability to be in two places at the same time.  This has been verified too many times to be a fluke or a fake.  It's probably best to keep in mind that quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet, \\"There are more things in heaven and earth than are thought of in your philosophy, Horatio.\\"  If we can only keep an open mind, the marvels of God's universe await us.  Hopefully, we will be mature enough to appreciate them.
0143038095|5.0|This is a powerful book about love, tragedy, and ties that bind immigrant familes.  It's the story of four immigrant Chinese women and their American-born daughters.  The moms arrived in San Francisco long ago as young adults, and while they love their now-adult daughters they often cannot understand them - the moms also remain reluctant to reveal parts of their tragic past in their still-beloved China. The four daughters are now in their 30's and also loving, but too Americanized to always understand their China-raised mothers. Are such sentiments universal among immigrants?  We meet Lindo Jong, who'se over-bearing pride in her talented daughter Wavery creates problems.  Ying-ying St. Clair left a bad husband in China, married an American out of respect but not affection, and is hurt to see her daughter Lena passively stuck in another loveless marraige.  Perhaps most moving is Suyuan Woo, forced by war's circumstance to abandon baby twins in China in 1944 - if they are alive and can be located her American-born daughter Jing-mei \\"June\\" will have to meet them.  This story describes the moms and the daughters, their loves, husbands, kids, careers, struggles, etc.       This powerful tale was adapted into a very good 1993 film.  Many say that THE JOY LUCK CLUB is a \\"woman's\\" book, but more than a few of us guys also like it.  Also highly recommended female-written books about China and family: WILD SWANS and RED CHINA BLUES.
B000002MTR|5.0|Now, to set the record straight, I only started listening to RHCP's music after Californication and I was weaned on hits like GET ON TOP and DON'T STOP. The poppy (for lack of a better word) sound of their music from that album onwards were what got me hearing them in the first place. I never knew what albums like One Hot Minute and Blood Sugar Sex Magik sounded like. So I thought why not start on some of them.    So there I was, listening to One Hot Minute and I thought it really sucked. I was convinced it sucked because it sounded so different from their latter albums. I also knew the hype of this album before I plunged in, Dave Navvaro taking over as lead guitarist and all that, so I was prepared to hate it alot.     But I started listening more. Then I started listening more after that. The sounds really weren't bad after a few listenings. Then as I listened to my favorites again (Coffee Shop, My friends, Aeroplane, Walkabout), I began thinking that this album might just be the best I've heard from the group. What a turnaround!     The pace of the songs are sort of slower to my relatively untrained ear and the sounds are darker and sadder like they said, but the catchy guitar rhythms started surfacing in the songs and me, being a guitar player who likes catchy riffs, really found myself swinging to the unique beats of this album. They were that good.    Make no mistake, this album is very different from Californication and upwards, but I guarantee you will find yourself liking the sounds nevertheless.    Now, I don't even recall me liking CAN'T STOP and GET ON TOP. That's a great testament to the greatness of this album.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|I read the first few reviews and was disappointed that most referred to 'greed' and 'lust for power' and other such tropes better left to the Daily Kos.    The protagonist, Daniel Plainview, is a self-starting entrepreneur who just wants to enjoy the fruit of his labors free of railroad price-gougers or vainglorious religious opportunists. He is single-minded, focused, and supremely confident. For you liberal anti-capitalist types out there, know this: this country was built by people like Daniel Plainview, and your comfortable existence was made possible by the enterprises of people like him.    Excellent performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, and the film is a paean to muscular no-nonsense capitalism.
0307455874|1.0|As I write this, Mr. Obama is, now, President-elect Obama.  I have listened to some of his speeches and read many of his written words.  The man is a very good speaker and a good writer.  However, I tend to believe in actions more than in words. I wonder if his actions will be true to his words.<br /><br />My own political beliefs are different from President-elect Obama's.  I hope I have not let that harm my judgement of the value of this book in determining what the man actually believes and will do.<br /><br />We have yet to see what sort of President our country has elected.  I worry because Mr. Obama; the citizen, the state legislator, and the US Senator; did not always act when he had the chance and never showed any willingness to embrace conservative notions such as limits on government, limits on governmental spending and limits on taxes.  He has been an observer and he has, apparently, mostly admired leftist and socialist political thought.  So, will he be as moderate as this book claims?  During the campaign, there were a few instances where Senator McCain chose to be more active in some issues where Senator Obama was less active.  But, while claiming to be moderate, most of his actions were those of a left wing liberal.<br /><br />I find that I hope that President Obama will understand the diplomatic issues, the military issues, the economic issues, and all the other issues that a President must address as an active leader of our country.  I hope that he believes as strongly as I do in democracy, freedom, individualism, and liberty.  And, I hope he will be true to those principles.  However, this book does not convince me that he will act as he has claimed he believes.<br /><br />This book is written well enough.  However, I see so many areas where President Obama may not act well enough that I worry.  I worry that he has not written the truth of his beliefs and aspirations.  Thus, I must also rate this book with low grades, because there is little here that convinces me that this is the person we need as President.  I suppose that I must wait for his actions.the person we need as President.  I suppose that I must wait for his actions.

B000W8OM5Y|5.0|\\"Every man dies - Not every man really lives.\\"<br /><br />\\"Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live... at least a while.

Whenever I feel scared or down, I watch that battle scene, feel that speech, and act that soul.

B000WC3A0S|5.0|Fighting is the only sport that mirrors life itself. In basketball, football, and others, you don't have a chance to win if you're 20 points behind and there is 1 second left on the clock. Yet, in fighting, and in life, even if you have been knocked down, messed up, and left behind, you still can turn it all around with just one more punch...one more inch...one more step...<br /><br />Rocky is the hero within all of us.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|If there's anything I've learned about quality music, you can't judge on its initial listen or two. A good rule of thumb for me has become: If I like your CD instantly, I know I won't for long. If I don't like it when I first hear it, I will probably love it. So I have no review at all to give to Dido's new output. I bought it, I've heard it four times, but trying to say what it means at this point would be like trying to tell you all about winter on the very first day of winter. You just can't know it all based on the first day of the season.<br />I'm an ardent fan of hers, but just like her last two albums, her lyrics, her songs, the beats, her voice, it all has ways of dropping in on me at odd moments, whether I'm actually listening to it or not; a year later I may find that Safe Trip Home will be an album I can't live without for the rest of my life.<br />I'm a fan of the Turkish singer Berdan Mardini. I have three of his albums and was convinced that his latest was basically a waste of space. But a funny thing happened over time, and many months later, Berdan's soft voice and strong music made his way back into my car cd player. Now I don't know how I lived a year without it. Dido's safe trip may not make it into overly critical or impatient ears, but I'm sure that she will make a safe trip home to my heart and mind, and she will get there in her own time.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is the story of seven samurai who stood up for the forsaken and abandoned souls of society. They risked their lives for these peasants against a band of bandits.

B001F290E4|5.0|Seal brings back the glory of a wonderful period in music.  Great classics by Sam Cooke, James Brown, Otis Redding et al. No one can sing a song like the original artists, however, Seal brings goose bumps to the surface with his silky voice.  I have played his CD at a couple of dinner parties I've had and people get out of their chairs for a slow dance, especially to Sam Cooke's \\"A Change Is Coming\\".  Everyone that has heard his CD has enjoyed how Seal has brought this music back to life!  I have already gifted this CD to four people. Everyone else that has heard it is buying the CD. Enjoy!!
B001EO2UJK|5.0|So, we finally come to it at last: the third & final Genesis box set in the band's box set trilogy. And this time, we're going all the way back to the band's beginning! \\"Genesis 1970-1975\\" is the Peter Gabriel era, the early days of the band when Phil Collins stayed behind the drumkit (or, in the case of \\"Trespass,\\" wasn't even in the band yet), and Peter Gabriel was the frontman, dressing up in all of his wild, wacky costumes. Five albums included here: \\"Trespass,\\" \\"Nursery Cryme,\\" \\"Foxtrot,\\" \\"Selling England By The Pound,\\" and \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway,\\" all remastered and remixed by producer Nick Davis, with lots of fantastic early concert footage, and insightful interviews with the various bandmembers, recorded in 2007 (NOTE: the group's 1969 debut album, \\"From Genesis To Revelation,\\" is not included in the box set for legal reasons). The box set also comes with an exclusive bonus disc of rare tracks and exclusive footage, and a handsome 42-page booklet. All five Genesis albums featured here are 5-star classics in my book, and the sound quality and remixing on all of them is nothing short of superb (thank you, Nick Davis!). Like the two Genesis box sets before it, Davis has once again brought the vocals more up front, as well as some of the instrumentation, so you can now hear notes & passages played & sung that were previously buried. \\"The Lamb,\\" in particular, is a whole new album! I heard stuff on this new version of \\"The Lamb\\" that I've *never* heard before (there's even a few more seconds added to Mike Rutherford's mystic strumming on \\"Fly On A Windshield\\"---I never knew the track had been edited!). The bonus disc of rarities is a real treat---most of these rare cuts have already been issued on the \\"Genesis Archive 1967-1975\\" box set, and they're all fabulous (including the phenomenal \\"Twilight Alehouse\\"), but the main attraction here is the previously-unreleased 15-minute tape called \\"Genesis Plays Jackson,\\" a never-finished soundtrack the band recorded for an aborted BBC documentary about the painter Michael Jackson, and the band would later raid some of this material for \\"Trespass,\\" \\"Nursery Cryme,\\" and \\"The Lamb.\\" It is *very* fascinating stuff to hear. And the video content on this box set is sensational, with lots of amazing vintage concert footage of Peter & the boys in action, including the priceless, rare 1973 concert film shot on the \\"Selling England\\" tour (it's about an hour long), and  equally-priceless TV performances recorded in 1971, '73 and '74. And listen to this: while there is no \\"proper\\" footage included from \\"The Lamb\\" tour---regretfully, the band never filmed the \\"Lamb\\" show in it's entirety---the 5.1 DVD of \\"The Lamb\\" offers an outstanding, visual reconstruction of the concert, including the band's original slides from the show, bootleg footage, and photos. It is absolutely breathtaking to watch, and probably the closest we'll ever get to an actual film of Genesis performing \\"The Lamb\\" themselves. And the 2007 interviews with all the guys are terrific, very informative and insightful. The *only* debit I can think of about \\"1970-1975\\" is the unfortunate omission of \\"From Genesis To Revelation,\\" but I won't deduct any stars from my rating for it. Besides, \\"From Genesis To Revelation\\" IS available if you want it. It's not the greatest album Genesis ever made, but it's very good and you should still get it, AND you can complete your Genesis studio-album collection with it, too. I'm thrilled beyond words---my all-time favorite band have finally been honored in a huge, huge way with these three box sets. Pick up \\"Genesis 1970-1975\\" right now, and, as Peter Gabriel sang on \\"Cinema Show,\\" take a little trip back with Father Tiresias. Thank you, and long live Genesis!
B0002STNQ2|3.0|worse than Jurassic Park. Stuck square in anonymity, this book would never have had more than a handful of reviews if not for the author. Attach a big enough name to anything that isn't awful and some people will love it.    Others have summarized it, you can read those reviews as well as you can this one, so I will save time and point out what is right and what is wrong.    First, the good. The characterization is better here than it is in most Michael Crichton novels. This is refreshing, although he still can't write an intelligent and dynamic female character to save a novel. Strangely. In any case, Jack Forman, our protagonist, is much more three dimensional than previous, and later, Crichton characters. It was too bad that it was really a one-time thing.    The bad. The ending was lame. Really lame. I saw it coming about halfway through the book. And it could have been so much better, too, which was even worse. Also, all of the characters except for Jack Forman are awful. Truly, jaw-droppingly bad. Many of them are retreads from other books by Crichton. As if his Word file says, \\"Insert ubiquitous fat, obnoxious, computer expert guy here.\\"    The science in this one is also bad. No matter how you build nanotechnology, Escherichia coli cannot live in the desert. It is too dry, there is too much UV light, etc. At least this time, though, the people who he has villainized are merely a single company, and not an entire business, like lawyers or molecular biologists. It is more reasonable that a half-dozen people could fall into the mental traps that appear in this book than the entirety of an academic discipline, which is just awful.    Worth reading, but probably only once. Worth owning for Crichton fans, who will like it.    C    Harkius
B001GAPC1K|5.0|You simply can't go wrong with bluray, especially with a great movie like Iron Man!
B0013N3DSE|5.0|Tnis is a Christmas gift for my son but this has to be one of my favorite all time movies.  I love Errol Flynn and his athleticism and his anything goes attitude made this a fun movie to watch.  The cast was a oerfect match and played well off each other.  A must see on regular dvd so it must be really spectacular in bluray.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Great movie from the sixties, I remember vaguely some of the highlights but now I was able to relive it. I am very pleased.
B001ER4CNY|3.0|BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU OPEN THIS. THE DVDs ARE NOT SUPPORTED WELL ENOUGH IN THE BODY OF THE JEANNIE BOTTLE. MINE TUMBLED OUT, HIT THE FLOOR AND WELL ... WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. EACH DVD IS HELD IN ITS OWN SLEEVE; ALL THE SLEEVES ARE GLUED TOGETHER IN AN ACCORDION-LIKE FASHION. THE DVDs ARE TOO HEAVY SO THAT'S WHY THE SLEEVES BROKE APART FROM ONE ANOTHER AND THE ENTIRE SET FELL OUT.  THE CONCEPT IS AWESOME. THE FINAL PRODUCT, NEEDS SOME WORK. I'M NOT ENTIRELY DISAPPOINTED THOUGH. THE PRICE I PAID IS LESS THAN BUYING THE SERIES SEPARATELY. A TRUE \\"I DREAM A JEANNIE\\" FAN TO THE END.
B00015YVDG|1.0|I'm not sure about this particular DVD because after it was delivered to my house, someone took it. I didn't even get to open or watch the movie. I've seen it through borrowing from people or libraries-it's one of my favorite MEL GIBSON movies.
0061122416|2.0|I was expecting more from this book. Unfortunately, it did not deliver. The author borrows heavily from earlier writings, showing little in the way of true originality or creativity. His ideas seem simplistic and shallow (e.g., Personal Legend), while the repetetiveness of certain words like \\"omen\\" and phrases (e.g., Language of the World)are laughable. Worse, he seems to believe that \\"when a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help him get it.\\"  What nonsense!  On the plus side the story was somewhat interesting. However, the central ideas are simply not seminal and to be perfectly blunt, the book seemed amateurish.   If you are looking for a great spiritual book written by a true master, read Journey to Ixtland by Carlos Castenda. His other books are almost as good. Hermann Hesse is another terrific writer with something important and original to say.    Enjoy!!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I absolutely love this album. It's the best I've bought in years. Can't stop playing it and don't want to - the more I listen, the more I love it. Every single song is fantastic. I hope David gives us one after another like this. Great voice, amazing lyrics.
B000000OQY|5.0|Guns N' Roses hit back with their follow-up sophmore album \\"GN'R: Lies.\\"  This album of course contains the original EP material from \\"Live Like A Suicide.\\"  Known for its big hit \\"Patience\\" as well as its controvertial hooks in \\"One In A Million\\" this album I believe has stood the test of time, and really gives another side to the original band that dissipated long before their time!    1. Reckless Life -  A true rocker of a song that kicks right into the GnR format fans had come to know from their AFD debut.  You can tell right away how young Axl's voice was, and really how young the band was at the time of this recording.  Still, a very solid track with great guitar work and harmonizing of vocals on this one.  4.5/5    2. Nice Boys -  The first \\"cover\\" the band was able to showcase on an album.  This song is one that truly grasped what the band was about.  Axl boats \\"Nice boys, don't play rock n' roll; I'm not a nice boy!\\"  Amazing guitar work on this one, and the bass stands out hard as well.  Great track. 5/5    3. Move To The City -  This was one song that took me awhile to really get a feel for.  While good, I feel the band lacked something on this track and didn't really put their all into it.  Vocals are good, but something's missing here.  Good rocker overall, but somewhat forgettable. 4/5    4. Mama Kin -  The band strikes back with their cover of the Aerosmith classic.  A very, very strong output by the band here.  Everything comes together where the last track may have fallen.  Where cover songs can fall short at times, young GnR does this song major justice! 5/5    5. Patience -  The stand-out track on the album, and aside from SCOM, the first real ballad from the band.  Acoustic elements take the forefront here, which I think is good, as it shows another side of the band.  Hard rocking bad boys at heart, even they can tame themselves for a time!  And yes, we all do need just a little patience!  5/5    6. Used To Love Her -  This is my personal favorite on the album!  A simple song, with a simple message; it however has a killer hook that will be stuck in your head for days!  Awesome guitar work on this one, and the vocals are top-notch! 5/5    7. You're Crazy -  A song fans may recognize from the AFD album.  However, this version is stripped of the electric guitar and replaced with an acoustic sound.  have no fear though, because this version rocks!  many times I find myself perferring this version over the other.  Great tight work by the entire band on this track! 5/5    8. One In A Million -  One of the most controvertial songs the band has ever written; and by today's standards may not even be that bad.  I think the band was just having fun on this track and trying to get that rise out of people.  Well, at the time I guess it worked!  Great song and a pretty cool way to end their sophmore album! 4.5/5    So there you have it, sophmore slump?  I think not.  Little did us fans know that this was in some ways the last time we'd see the true \\"hard rocking\\" GnR.  Of course, next up was their great dual 'Illusion' albums.  If you're a fan of Guns at all, then you have to get this album: Lies and all!!
B001EO2UKO|5.0|No, this CD isn't No Angel.  Just like Jewel will never have another Pieces of You.    Yet, Dido managed to make a beautiful CD with a more mature sound and appeal.    Artists have to move on to survive in the music business, yet Dido takes her amazing voice and emotion and puts it into a CD sure to be one of my all time favorites!
B000000OSE|5.0|Some say that this was the end of Guns N' Roses.  The dual output of the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums.  They say Axl Rose was to theatrical; and instead of focusing on the music, he was too concerned about creating a visionary masterpiece.  Well, aren't some of the greatest geniuses in history, visionaries?  And, if you still think that Axl didn't focus on the music as much, take a listen to UYI #1 and you'll see that not everything you hear is the truth.    1. Right Next Door To Hell -  This is the classic GnR way to begin an album!  Hard hitting right off the bat.  Although this song itself may be considered one of the weakest songs on the album, it still shows that the band has that raw edge!  4/5    2. Dust N' Bones -  I love this song becuase it has two great GnR elements tied into one song.  A rawness and a \\"don't care\\" attitude, yet it has that softer, visionary feel to it where I think the \\"Illusion\\" album really takes off.  Both the bass playing and guitar work are exceptional here as well! 4.5/5    3. Live And Let Die -  What would GnR be if they didn't have at least one good cover on an album?  This time, they pick the Paul McCartney classic, and boy do they let it all hang out!!  There is no denying Slash's guitar work here as he just shreds it up!  Not the best all aroun cover I've heard, but very GnR-like!  5/5    4. Don't Cry (original) -  This is a stand-out ballad for the album!  Although I perfer the alternate version whic appears on the second album, this is right up there!  The vocals are haunting, and you really get the sense that there is some real heartache going on.  Filled with a lot of imagery, and as evidence by the music video, very theatrical as well.  Awesome song, again showing the bands versatility.  5/5    5. Perfect Crime -  I love this song!  GnR get back to their raw basics on this track and Axl holds nothing back.  On the other side too, the listener can hear the very subtle growth between this album and AFD.  Great song, with fun,killer hooks all around! 5/5    6. You Ain't The First -  For me this is one song where the album just seems to be lost.  I can see where the band tries to make it fit, but something is off just a bit.  Not a bad song overall, just not a terribly good song that sticks out.  Very rare for the band that, despite the bad placement, still plays very well here.  3.5/5    7. Bad Obsession -  This is another one of my favorite tracks on the album.  Just has a sick groove to it that is hard to describe.  I would say its very mediterranean sounding.  Very cool vocals that really describe where the band was at during this time! 5/5    8. Back Off B!tch -  To me this song is a follow-up to the previous track.  You know what?  It too, is killer!  I love the guitar work by Slash on here, and again Axl seems angry and very passionate about what he has to say!  Great song!  5/5    9. Double Talkin' Jive -  To continue, I also feel that this is a follow-up tp BoB.  If this is truly the case, than this string of songs make for the true meat of the album!  I truly enjoy how the band was able to put this song together; seems to flow nicely and, while fun, there seems to be a lot of emotion into it as well. 5/5    10. November Rain -  The grandiose EPIC of the album!  The Queen-esche rock opera that made people stand up and say \\"Wow, Axl has amazing song writing skills!\\"  While others stood up and said \\"Wow, this is the downfall of the true GnR.\\"  There is no denying the power behind this track.  From Axl's vocals, to the killer guitar solo from Slash, to everything else!  This song is amazing and really captured I believe, what the whole \\"illusion\\" sessions were about!  5/5    11. The Garden -  Fresh of the heels of the \\"November Rain\\" epic, comes \\"The Garden\\"; one song I never could truly get into.  For me there was just too much trying to be crammed into one track and just seems jumbled.  Not overly bad, but a weak link on the album. 3.5/5    12. Garden Of Eden -  This track againtook me awhile to really sink my teeth into, but soon enough, I can see that it is a very solid rockin' track!  Solid guitar playing here and the bass stands out very well!  One can sense the mixture of AFD attitude, and UYI storytelling.  Good song. 4/5    13. Don't Damn Me -  A very, very cool song!  Caught my attention right away and I believe it is a hidden gem on this epic story of an album!  The vocals are very tight, and the ban just seems on their game 100%.  Great song to rock out to!! 5/5    14. Bad Apples -  Another song that took me awhile, but again turned into being a very solid rocker, and one that I look foward to hearing every time!  One could argue that Axl was talking about himself and the impendig end of the band when he screeches, \\"One bad apple can spoil the whole damn bunch!\\"  Killer guitar work, and just a fun track! 4.5/5    15. Dead Horse -  if it were me, I would have a=switched the placement of this song and \\"Bad Apples.\\"  It just seems to me, coming off the heels of the solid rocker, this song just seems to fall a bit.  However, the following track more than makes up for it, and this song isn't that bad overall.  Good guitar work.  3.5/5    16. Coma -  A grand, grand end to the first part of this new GnR journey.  A song that you think ends about three or four times and just keeps coming right back kicking your teeth in!  A very awesome track, that while on the long side, signals the next part of Using one's own Illusion!!!    There you have it, UYI 1.  There are in my opinion more rockers on here than on part two, so if you want the GnR with a bit more attitude and less flashyness, you'd perfer part one.  But, if you're a real fan of Guns...get them both!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|She has done it again!! Another stellar performance by this most awesome artist! Chock full of goodies, including my favorite track,the hit-bound, \\"Sober\\". Enjoy!<br /><br />JR
B001AQO3WY|1.0|Sure the firefights and comraderie is in here, but the one UNDERLINING, SUBLIMINAL point it makes in each episode is the wontan killing of civilians and collateral damage the US military does in Iraq.  The sheer joy and amusement of the military at the destruction it is causing is harpped on, and on.  I saw the whole serise(except the last episode)and the writers also just love to show men defacating and urinating and shooting civiliand, women, children, structures, etc.; as long as they're showing guns spitting spent shells and having that cool sound of M-16/M14 goin off.    I also read the book and it seems the author was also fully engrossed in only recording the civilina casualties.  Each time they came in contact with the enemy, woemen and children were the only ones that got paragraphs and paragraphs of details.    Oh and there were Syrians and Iraqi jihadist that got killed also, but you get a sentance and then on to the chilren and innocents getting shredded left and right.  It did happen, I read it on \\"One Bullet Away\\" by Nate Fick, the guy featered in Gen. Kill the book and tv series, but come on, give the guys some credit.  By the way, \\"One Bullet Away\\" is a waaaay better book than Gen. Kill.  The Gen. Kill authore just like to let you know how many times men in war go use the bathroom.  He also details it over and over and over.  We know guys out there don't have nice restrooms or private bathrooms, okay.  It goes without saying.  But to write about it over and over...  The tv series also likes this aspect of the tale.  You get to see guys butts alomst every 15 minutes.  You sure don't see that on Platoon by Oliver Stone, or even implied on Tour of Duty(the '80s tv series).    The brutality of war is shown, but mostly how it affects women and children in the line of fire.  The real bad guys don't get much time in the book or the tv series.  In no way does this compare to Saving Priveate Ryan and Band of Brothers.  Those movies/series were about the heartof the US military, not the heartless ones they are portrayed here.    I for one will not be buying it on DVD, nor do I recommend anyone else to do so either.  Unless you like to see the killing of innocents by our incompetent military(which is what the book and series paint our miltary to be).  I did 12 yrs in the US Navy so I know a little about military comraderie.  It's show here, but in a deceitful context.
B000H7I6CU|1.0|It´s unbelievable.  The package says that it is in Spanish, but it is completely in English.  It does´t have even Spanish subtitles.
0312427646|5.0|Eminently readable highly original and mildly sarcastic spoof centering on the Queen of England and her entourage. Very funny.
B0010ZR160|3.0|I liked the story of this movie and I thought the acting was good, however, the overuse of the \\"f\\" word detracted from it.  If someone cannot be more creative with words than that, something is wrong.  And if people really talk like this then they need an education.  Using the \\"f\\" word to describe EVERYTHING shows a lack of creativity.  The problem is in this day and age most movies are full of profanity.  Using such language should not become mainstream or the norm.  Actors, writers, directors, etc. should be ashamed of themselves!
B001CSQIMI|5.0|To R.Lapine: No, this is not a remaster. Unless I'm totally mistaken all the ECM Touchstones are 'just' repackaged (cardbox instead of tray- fine with me!) budget issues of the older CD versions.<br /><br />As a recording engineer and music lover, I'm come to despise most 'remasters': More often than not, remastering means nothing but more loudness and therfore less dynamics. It's become an unfortunate trend in recent years and it's especially sad when done to jazz records or anything 'acoustic' in general.<br /><br />As for the music on 'New Chatauqua' it's always been on my my fave Pat Metheny recordings. 'Strumming' is the central theme here and it's interesting to note that this hasn't been doen too often with jazz guitar. Pat himself pointed that out in a recent Intervew and to my knowledge, only John Mc Laughlin has worked with this very guitaristic technique on some on his early records like 'Extrapolation' or 'My Goal's beyond'.<br /><br />Metheny though builds this whole record on the bright, ringing sounds of his 6- and 12-srting acoustic guitars and the results are outstanding. This recording sounds as fresh and sparkling today as it did back in the day.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0007NOL46|1.0|I know most of the other reviews say this is a great album . well it is , however during this sacd version there are many drop outs not found on the dvd audio version . you can really here it on John's voice during the acid queen. also the dvd audio lets you enjoy this masterpiece without changing discs . get the dvd audio version for the best reproduction of this classic.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory,  but seldom get a chance to watch it or tape the show.  This was the first time I purchased a complete season of a television show...it was great, no commercials and I was able to get a handle on the characters as they developed.  Looking forward to season 2.
1400032717|5.0|This book takes the reader into a different world--the world that seems the same as our world, only this child sees the information in another dimension.  The character, Christopher Boone, takes the reader into the world of autism.  I am currently using this book with an 8th grade reading group, and we are reading it aloud. Reading the book aloud brings the difference in thinking and processing and the humor and pathos to the table.   The kids are fascinated by the out-of-the-norm way this character views the world. To them, it is a mystery how this child thinks and functions in our fast-paced society. I highly recommend this mystery for children and adults.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|What can be said about Daft Punk that already hasn't been said?? They are simply the greatest electronic music group in the world.  Although there are many talented DJ's out there, no one beats Daft Punk, and this album proves it.  Its a non-stop party from start to finish, with Daft Punk in complete control of the audience the whole time.  If you want to feel good, put a smile on your face, and give yourself a great feeling about life, then pick up this album.  Put it in, turn up the volume, and get ready for music that will blow you away.  They seamlessly mix songs together, intertwining sounds, beats and other noises to form one awesome sound.  A truly classic album from a truly legendary duo.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This CD is absolutely brilliant! The only thing I have bad to say about it is that there aren't enough tracks! Vivia La Vida, Lovers in Japan and Strawberry Swing are my favorite. I was always loved Coldplay but never have owned a CD of theirs until now!
0743270754|5.0|The thing I appreciated most about this book is that Goodwin allows us to experience the voices of women and the importance of the women around Lincoln, Chase, Seward, and Bates.  Although it is changing, so much American history is delivered to us through the voices of men.  Not only is this a great book about Lincoln's political genius, some that was new to me, but she highlights the role of those intelligent and strong women that shaped these men and influenced them in their views.  I found their stories very compeling and I honor them in all the work they did to shape history to the present.  I disagree with those who say that this book is dry and academic.  Goodwin presents a perfect balance between academic history and a very good page turner.  It was hard for me to put down.
0143038583|5.0|As omnivores, this book proposes, our lives are complicated by the question of what to eat in this landscape of plentiful food.  The author starts with the most common options--processed supermarket foods and fast food.  Tracing these meals backward, he finds an unbelievably tangled system that urges farmers to grow vast amounts of unneeded corn at low prices that are then subsidized by the government.  Getting rid of this excess of corn then becomes the driving force behind factory farms, where animals are kept in deplorable conditions and pumped with antibiotics to keep their bodies from breaking down.<br /><br />Pollan's investigation of mainstream organic farms didn't paint a much better picture, despite the assumption that organic animals are better treated.<br /><br />Moving toward smaller farms, though, Pollan finds an entirely different attitude, a respect for animals and the rhythms of nature.<br /><br />Pollan finishes off his quest with a hunter-gatherer mission, and he experiences the difficulty and satisfaction of killing and scavenging a meal from his immediate environment.<br /><br />I liked the details of this narrative, and the way the facts of factory farming were presented in a way that made the situation clear without seeming to be overly sensationalized.  I also liked that Pollan discussed in detail his thoughts about vegetarianism and the reasons why he chose not to go that way, even after seeing how animals were killed and prepared.<br /><br />Before reading this book, I had a vague idea of the meat industry, of course.  Reading this book clarified the situation for me, though, and made me start thinking about the sacrifices I might be willing to make in my own life and my own budget in order to eat more fresh and local foods.
1582701709|3.0|First things first.  Although it is an uplifting book (the video is even better) it is basically a marketing vehicle for the speakers in the video.   If you research it - you will find that, while it may have been Rhonda Byrne's brainchild - The organization behind the books, DVD's, and the website actually belong to about a dozen motivational speakers all of which are featured in the DVD as speakers.  of course Ms. Byrne is one of them.      This is not purely a criticm.  The DVD and book are very good at INTRODUCING the viewer/reader to the basics of \\"Law of Attraction\\".  However, unfortunately, the reader will gain little more than motivation from this introduction that they can use.      \\"The Secret\\" accomplishes what it was seemingly designed to truly do.  It leads people to the speakers who are featured on the video where you can purchase coursework from them.  Jack Canfield is one of the featured speakers and he has been a motivational speaker that has touted Law of Attraction for years.  It would seem that all of these speakers (again, about a dozen or more) came together, formed a partnership along with Rhonda Byrne and they put out a brilliant bit of advertising that they did not need to pay for since we all purchased the book and DVD's from them.  It really was marketing genius at it's best.      In closing, yes, I do believe that the Law of Attraction is valid.  It is not a new idea.  It's been around for ages by different names.  Ms. Byrne may exagerate it's origins but the basic concept is indeed very old and you will find it paraphrased in Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism etc.  So again, yes, I believe it is valid.  And I believe these \\"Secret gurus\\" can and are willing to teach it to you.  In fact their complete courses are very affordable.  They range from $15 to $120 which is not enough to kill anyone's budget.  And the courses are complete.  The Secret - however, is not even close to complete.  All it is going to do is exactly what it wasdesigned to do - make you purchase materials from one of the speakers on the DVD.      My advice - skip \\"The Secret\\".  Go online to get a list of the speakers in The Secret (for free).   Then go to their sites (or even Amazon for most of them) and pick up a REAL complete course.  You can even download the audio forms of some courses on iTunes.
B001GQSY5U|3.0|Most fans of the Star Wars movies will enjoy this animated filler that gives us some background information about what happened between Star Wars Episode II and III. The graphics won't impress you to the point you say, wow that's good, but they are decent enough that you shouldn't mind watching them. The storyline is also good enough to hold the interest of most people that liked the movies. Worth at least a rental. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury\\".<br /><br />CA Luster

Richelle did such a good job and this book will make you go crazy and want more!!I cried, laughed, screamed, and was so anxious. Rose has grown up so much and I really love the Dimitri and Rose thing going on but hopefully she gives Adrian a chance! he's a cutie :-) I'm so excited for the next book, hopefully it comes out soon! These novels are gonna be a hit and hopefully better than Twilight :-) Totally worth the money guys! don't judge these books by it's cover.
0143038419|2.0|I read this book for the sole reason that it had been on the best seller list for a long time.   The good thing about this book is that it shows how the author saw herself through the bad times and was able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm sure a lot of people can relate to it and learn something from it.   However, it was unbearable to see everything in the book being about herself and nothing else. Her every interaction with people has a sole purpose. Herself.  She talked about a girl she befriended in the ashram in India. She says that the girl wore spectacles that had broken lens but that didnt keep her from wearing it.. For some reason I got stuck on that line.   Even when she supposedly falls in love, it is all about how he treats her/compliments her and such.  Also, It wasn't very convincing to see someone change from one mode to another seamlessly (Eat pray love) and become oblivious of the previous mode.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I hesitated to give this album a good mark. I don't approve of the way Waters hijacked the Pink Floyd name for this solo project, already having dominated production of The Wall.  And the premise of the album (angst over the Falklands War) seems really misguided and irrelevant. War is war, but Waters could hardly have picked a more innocuous one to whine about.    Ultimately, though, the album succeeds in one very real way: I enjoy listening to it. This is the only Pink Floyd album I still listen to with any frequency.     Maybe this reflects my personality, which would imply, I guess, that I'm somewhat depressed and low key. But I think that's an oversimplification. Waters can play loud and fast, for example in \\"Not Now John\\" and again in \\"Two Suns in the Sunset.\\" I think he knows joy as well as pain and much of what he communicates is not just sorrow, but remorse at what could have been.    The lyrics of this album are also well done, and better than most of the pseudo-intellectual stuff that Gilmour would produce after the split. From \\"Two Suns\\":    The wire that holds the cork  That keeps the anger in  Gives way  And suddenly it's day again    The sun is in the east  Even though the day is done  Two suns in the sunset...  Could be the human race is run    That stands on its own as poetry and I don't see anything like that coming from Gilmour's Pink Floyd. I must also admit, though, that the albums Gilmour did without Waters are also some of my favorites.. I think both men benefited from making their escape.     In summary, this album feels like a good drink with someone older and wiser, taken at a bad moment in life to make one's self feel a little less alone. The bitterness is real, and it can be refreshing to know that it's shared.
0393327655|1.0|This is probably one of the worst books ever written on the subject of atheisim and the end of religious faith.  Harris should be taken to task on a number of issues, one, which cannot be overlooked, is his simplistic view on torture as necessary to secure vital information...Has Harris not been paying attention to the Iraq War in particular Abu Ghirab?  Has he not read anything by Chalmers Johnson-someone who is more experinced than he is-on the subject of torture and information.    The other area of diagreement should be evident from Harris suggesting that people are becoming more rational and are leaving churches and religious beliefs behind them-Harris believes this is true in any religion but his own spirituality.  He has consistently praised Buddhism and Hinduism while at the same time he has critised Christian teachings..I mean, I am an atheist, but this is just beyond the pale of rationality.  So readers, stay with Daniel Dennett or Richard Dawkins.
B000UJ48U4|5.0|When one loves such a divisive and widely-knocked film as Eyes Wide Shut, it's inevitable that a puzzled friend will eventually beg the question: &#34;Why? What do you like about it?&#34;<br /><br />And I honestly have no clear answer. Why, in fact, do I love this film so damn much? I don't know. All I know is that its dreamy, Christmastime haze suckers me in every time. All I know is that it's hard for me to hear Shostakovich's Waltz #2 on its own terms without feeling an immense surge of emotion. I don't cry, mind you, but I feel like I could.<br /><br />I like the film because of its subtleties; the small, odd gestures and movements that each character makes. The things they say and the unique ways in which they say it. I adore the film's late-night, wintertime vibe, and its gorgeous colors and striking images. I like how the film can be read in seemingly endless ways. Only Kubrick could make a film that's interpreted as anything from an expose of the Illuminati to a psycho-sexual Freudian odyssey to some sort of sociological lampooning of Tom Cruise's shattered ego.<br /><br />Most of all, I like how Kubrick went out with this one. Just a subtle, unassuming flick about a few days in the life of a rich doctor following some silly misunderstanding over the events of a Christmas party. No over-the-top violence or grand statements about the evolution of humanity, just a curious sexually charged Christmas Carol for the 90's.<br /><br />And I wouldn't want it any other way.
1400034205|5.0|A stable of characters that you will never forget.  The author brings them to life in masterful fashion.  This is what people mean when they speak of character development.  WSM understood women and men, their relationships, and their strengths and weaknesses.  Its' message is as resounding and absolute now as it was decades ago....perhaps it is even more relevant in this time of McMansions and the 15000 Dow.  I have met a few people like Larry in this world.  They always had a great affect on me, leaving me yearning to become more selfless, more generous and kind.  This wonderful novel instills in me the same feelings; it inspires the goodness of man.

B000ZLFALI|1.0|First off let me relate a story that will demonstrate my clear bias to this film going in - My wife had bought the CD based on some review that she had read or on someone's recommendation, it doesn't matter which. She played it for me in the car one night. Before it got to the third song I pulled it out of the deck and tossed it. The music was so bad it was insulting. I couldn't believe that anyone could possibly consider these basterdized renditions of some of the Beatles' greatest songs as music fitting to listen to other than corporate CEOs who only cared about how much money they might bring in with sales.<br /><br />Now, if you had to rank this film against others of its nature, say, Hair or Jesus Christ Superstar, from that era, then, you'd have to rank it 5 stars. The movie accomplishes what it attempted to do with each song matched to entertaining visuals, though more often than not the songs' content don't match to the lyrics or to what the Beatles were saying or living at the time they wrote and performed them.<br /><br />But this film wasn't made in that era, it isn't that era, it is today, here and now.<br /><br />Fast forward to the future, some time into the present. I was preparing to do my wash as a good documentary (Shut Up and Sing - the story of the Dixie Chicks controversy - no I am not a fan, but the film was good documentary coverage of what they went thru) had just ended. I took a quick scan of what was next offered on the movie channels that I subscribe to and saw this film's write up, thinking, a movie revolving around Beatles' songs, how bad can it be, besides, I'd be in and out of the room doing the laundry, so if I missed any of it, at least the songs would help me pass the time. How wrong I could have been never crossed my mind.  Unfortunately I didn't put the CD and movie in the same context until I was well into the film.<br /><br />Just to set the record straight - I stopped paying attention to this film before it was halfway through - I only wish I had a fast forward function on my set as I would have liberally used it during the time I was watching the film. I also want to state that I did not turn the film off, I did not walk out, I just tuned out.<br /><br />Given there are well over 400 reviews in this Amazon posting I didn't read them all, though I did my best to read as many of the negative ones as possible, once again, showing my bias. I started by reading the positives and found that they were basically all along the same lines, praising the greatness of the artists, the director, the visuals, and the accomplishments of all of their visions. I guess they were the same people that Mama Mia was created for.<br /><br />About all I could add to the line of positive thoughts about Across the Universe is that the film did its best to follow thru with an exploration of that era's look, feel, and philosophies, while attempting to include all sorts of events and music innovations (was that woman supposed to Janis and her boyfriend Hendrix), although, those were basterdized as well, ala Woody Allen's Zelig style, and later Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump.<br /><br />Maybe I'm thinking of Across the Universe was a mutation birthed by a copulation of the films Hair and Godspell.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie with Beatles' songs in it see Hard Day's Night, see HELP, even go see Yellow Submarine (not one of my favorites though great music) but whatever you do, don't see Across the Universe and then walk around telling people you just saw a great Beatles film because all you saw was this bad piece of crappy celluloid. If you want to hear great Beatles' songs, listen to the Beatles. Listen to any one of their songs, song by them, and then compare it to the songs in this film. If you think these were as good, came even close, or were actually better, then . . . you, my friend, are just a fool without a hill.<br /><br />[Note: I'm not a fan of the films Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and Tommy (OK, not a Beatles' film but all of these films are of the same mindset, look and feel), but this ain't no Tommy, it ain't no SPLHCB (though I guess that was what they were thinking), and it ain't a decent attempt at properly portraying the Beatles' songs.]<br /><br />PS: I find it extremely unfortunate that the writer, director, and producers felt they needed to coop the aspects of British music history (the way they used the Beatles' final roof concert as a plot dressing in the closing of this film turned my stomach) that they did in this film and morph them into some sort of American basterdization of life seen thru American eyes during that era. But I guess that was what this movie was all about, morphing life into their desire to make money.

0140364536|5.0|I came across Watership Down about a decade ago, at a flea market, operated on the parking lot of Dongcheng Public Library of Beijing, China.    Upon turning over the first page, I never let it out of my hands until I finished reading the last line. I still clearly remember reading this book in a mini-bus with my colleagues on a business trip. The bus bumped and turned on a rough road, my eyes fixed on the book. One of my colleague asked, \\"Don't you feel dizzy reading in the bus?\\" \\"Not at all,\\" said I, \\"So long as my eyes are on the book.\\"    The copy I bought at the flea market was a Penguin edition published in the seventies, if I remember correctly. Its ridge was so worn out that the pages fell out. So several years later, I asked a friend to bring me a new Puffin edition, when he asked what souvenir I'd like to have after his visit to the U.K.    Richard wrote Watership Down for his little daughter, but his brain-child did and does fascinate many adults till today as well.
B001CB2A1I|4.0|King brings the horror to your homes, ladies. (and gentlemen)  This is the type of book my wife avoids as her OWN imagination is bad enough.  She can imagine the WORST possible scenarios to kidnapping, assault, abduction or home invasion but King is, of course, king.  Unsettling and a bit monstrous, the title is a subterfuge to relax the reader before the hammer falls. (or axe, or blade...)

B000X1R4S2|4.0|King weaves another tale of terror that follows children into their adulthood.  A beast that haunts a tight-knit group of kids and returns years later to reap vengence against the adults they have become.  The character development is awesome.  It's as if I know these people.  The storyline is great...until the end.  I'll leave it at that.  No spoilers here. Almost a 5 star.

B00129H7VS|5.0|I can only assume that if you're reading this, you've probably already seen or heard of how great the Band of Brothers mini-series is.  With this in mind, I'll spare you the review of the actual series, and just say that this is a great addition to a growing Blu-Ray collection.  I already owned this on DVD, but when seeing that the Blu-Ray price was only $10 more than the DVD for hours upon hours of entertainment(compared to the average 2-hour movie on Blu-Ray charging a $10 to sometimes $20 premium over it's DVD counterpart, I just couldn't pass up on this.  It was well worth the repurchase.  And my DVD set won't go to waste, as my younger brother has been eyeing it ever since I got it, so now he benefits as well.  The picture and sound quality of this set is superb.  As far as my modest Blu-Ray collection goes, this is by far the crown jewel as of now.

B00122PIMA|5.0|This was one of my favorite albums from the '80s. Robert Plant and company put together a sound both hauntingly classic, and freshly new.  How can you not like the remake of sea of love, or the jumpin good rockin at midnight. A perfect album for fans of big band/early rock.
B0013XS8A2|4.0|Never really cared for Mike Oldfield's previous works, I enjoyed Tubular Bells the song but not the Tubular Bells album.  I own \\"The Best of\\" album but wasn't really inspired enough by that to purchase any of his other albums.   So when I purchased \\"Music of the Spheres\\" I felt I was taking a real chance and might not enjoy it - fortunately I was wrong.   Strong melodies are supported by orchestra and choir.  It's like a sound track to a movie where they used only the most beautiful and melodic pieces.  This is not Tubular Bells and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys beautiful orchestral music.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of animated films, but I was completely blown away by \\"Wall-E.\\"  The story is simple - a lowly trash-collecting robot is the last remaining inhabitant of earth until a probe robot lands; romance blossoms.  What makes \\"Wall-E\\" so special is Wall-E, the robot who persistently (stubbornly?) continues cleaning earth 700 years after his assignment ended.  Over the years, Wall-E has developed a human-like curiosity and personality.  As he cleans (scooping trash into his body and turning it into a compact cube), he runs across items that intrigue him - a spork, a lighter, a rubrik's cube, a cassette of \\"Hello Dolly!\\"  He takes them back to his home (a truck) that he shares with his pet, a nameless cockroach.  These scenes portray heart-breaking loneliness and isolation better than any movie with human actors; they make \\"Wall-E\\" a work of art.<br /><br />After he meets the probe robot, Eve, he falls in love.  He tries vainly to get her attention, but she's far more advanced and has no time for a silly trash compactor.  However, his persistence is once again his strength, and she eventually takes notice of him.  The first time they speak to each other is one of the sweetest scenes in movies, and Wall-E's longing is more palpable than you'll see in any given flavorless romantic comedy.  The movie then shifts to a grander scale, as Wall-E follows the probe into space and meets the humans who abandoned earth.  Some of these space scenes are as grand as anything filmed by David Lean, with Wall-E always adding a touch of humanity to each scenario.  Superficially, Wall-E may seem like a cross between ET and R2-D2, but he's unique.<br /><br />\\"Wall-E\\" isn't just the best animated film ever, which I think it is.  The movie is bound to become a timeless classic, transcending the \\"cartoon\\" label.  There are very few movies in history that are better plotted or that are, ironically, more human.  The fact that the creators sneak in a timely \\"eco-friendly\\" plot is just a plus; \\"Wall-E\\" doesn't need to be topical when it's so brilliant.ll-E\\" doesn't need to be topical when it's so brilliant.

B000006MS3|2.0|I bought this because it's probably one of Kate's most celebrated albums, but I was terribly disappointed. Yes, the music is great, but the sound on this CD is very harsh and compressed. It sounds like a poor mp3 download really, with all the sound mushed into the midrange. Very unkind to the Kate's layered sound, it's almost unlistenable. I don't know whether this is because it was recorded in the early days of CD technology or whether this copy is simply from a bad master. The CD copy of The Kick Inside that I bought at the same time was fine.
0143036742|4.0|This book starts with a broadly comic familiar premise (86-year old, recently widowed, Ukrainian emigre Nikolai marries a blond gold-digger 50 years his junior, to the horror of his two daughters) and you can't help wondering if you've signed up for a predictable romp, maybe spiced up with some Ukrainian local color. Fortunately, Marina Lewycka has something more interesting in store than low comedy and lazy stereotypes and the story that unfolds is more nuanced than its initial premise would suggest, while still managing to be quite funny.<br /><br />Although Valentina, the blonde with the boobjob, is indeed a gold-digger, Lewycka is smart enough not to demonize her altogether. Furthermore, Vera and Nadezhda, Nikolai's adult daughters, are no saints either - they have issues of their own and as the story unfolds it's a tossup as to whose behavior is more reprehensible. The marriage of Nikolai and Valentina sours once money runs low, and Vera and Nadezhda must put their own differences aside to look out for their father's welfare as relations between him and Valentina careen from bad to worse. Against this background Lewycka also weaves in the story of Nikolai's early life in the Ukraine. The result is a surprisingly moving account of a family's dealing with a parent who refuses to grow old gracefully.<br /><br />This book reminded me strongly of Mark Haddon's second book, \\"A Spot of Bother\\" - it has the same kind of sprawling plot, idiosyncratic and exasperating characters, and is highly readable. A memorable first novel.

B000WTNCYA|5.0|When I heard Melody Gardot's cut \\"Worrisome Heart,\\" I was at work with my headphones plugged into an iTunes smooth jazz station.<br /><br />I had to stop what I was doing and listen to the song. For a minute, I thought it must be a previously unreleased Eva Cassidy tune, but then I checked out the playlist saw the name Melody Gardot. I had no clue who she was, but I went to the Internet, read her story and ordered the CD.<br /><br />The CD has been playing on my iPod for days now and the only criticism I have is that it's too short. Love her voice. Love her songs. Love her style.<br /><br />Can't wait to hear the new release. Would love to see her live. She's only 23 ... she'll be around for a long time, and aren't we lucky to enjoy the ride with her?

B0016Q2D5M|4.0|3D on TV isn't going to be anything like high tech IMAX, but it isn't all that bad with proper colored lenses. I have a sample pack of \\"Lee Filter\\" colored \\"gel\\" lenses 1.5\\"x3.5\\" that I got at a company that sells colored gel lenses for theater and band spot lights. What I did was start the movie and pause it at a place that showed 3D artifacts. The halo colors I saw were green and pink. They might be different on your TV depending on how your color is adjusted and that is the main point here. I don't think one pair of colored glasses is going to work well on all TVs. In this case, I started with light colored pinks and greens and kept trying darker samples of each color until I could no longer the see pink halo through the green lens or green halo through the pink lens. At this point all one should be able to see is a single object in the picture without any halo. I held the sample pack up to my eyes with the pink sample out to the left and the green sample out to the right. By changing the angle of the lenses between vertical to 45 degrees (darkens and lightens the image slightly) and rotating the lenses so one lense is closer to one eye than the other, I could fine tune the image. After I found the sweet spot, I sat back and really enjoyed the movie. Some of the 3D images actually left the TV but mostly it was like looking through a window at another 3D world. Until 3D format become uniform industry wide, I think this will work the best whether for red and blue or red and green and all shades in between. A person could remove the lenses from the sample pack and make their own glasses, but the next movie might not work with those exact colors.    BTW, the colors that worked for me were \\"Primary Green and Bright Pink\\", but again, it may be all in how the color scheme was set up on my TV.  Also, I have a 62\\" Toshiba Rear Projection DLP TV and I sat real close.    Good Luck. I hope you get to see this movie in 3D. It's fun. 2D is ok too, but not nearly as fun when riding through the mine shaft or when the birds that glow start flying around.

B001G1ACVY|5.0|Continuing the highly criticized practice of re-releasing hit albums to increase sales, Atlantic Records gives the royal treatment this week to Jason Mraz's runaway LP \\"We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.,\\" which remains high on the charts after six months, with a limited edition deluxe version.<br /><br />The re-release is backed with a second disc collecting the cheekily-titled \\"We Sing.,\\" \\"We Dance.\\" and \\"We Steal Things.,\\" three acoustic EPs he released leading up to the launch of the album containing stripped down versions of many of the tracks. The biggest asset, however, is a DVD of his performance to a sell-out crowd at Manhattan's Highline Ballroom on April 14. Many consider the rehashing of previously released material paired with new, exclusive content pure record company manipulation, and that is a valid point, but the addition of the concert alone will make this 2CD/DVD rechristening interesting for both curious casual listeners as well as the previously initiated.<br /><br />And there are certainly a slew of those curiously casual with the longevity of the album's lead single \\"I'm Yours\\" serving as a barometer of public interest. The song has had an uncanny journey that began circa early 2005, when Mraz began playing the song during live set lists in spite of Atlantic's final word on not including on it on his sophomore set \\"Mr. A-Z.\\" It garnered a life of its own, becoming known to scores of listeners in countries across the world on account of live recordings as well as the original demo, which found limited release on Mraz's \\"Extra Credit\\" EP.<br /><br />Due to this cult popularity Mraz and Atlantic made the decision to re-record the track to be the lead single from \\"We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.,\\" releasing it to radio and retail in time for Valentine's Day. Slowly but surely increasing in further popularity, it finally reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 in September, where it remains this week. That is quite a ride for one song to take.<br /><br />Still, there is more meat to Mraz than \\"I'm Yours,\\" and that is ably proven by the entirety of \\"We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.\\"  Second single \\"Make It Mine,\\" with its engulfing sing-a-long chorus, effervescent vocal performance and infectious feel good vibe is even better song than \\"I'm Yours,\\" while Mraz also cuts straight to the heart of problems both at home (\\"Love For a Child\\") and abroad (\\"Only Human\\"). He also utilizes an entrancing singing/rapping style on the haunting \\"Dynamo of Volition.\\" The breezy \\"Lucky\\" features Colbie Callait, while James Morrison stops in to add verses on the brooding \\"Details in the Fabric.\\"<br /><br />Mraz's talents only come across more strongly with the inclusion of the lo-fi acoustic disc, which brings out the essence of his songs to let them breathe, and the energetic Highline Ballroom concert proves his growing reputation as a live act to be justified. He is smart to recruit supremely talented musicians in the studio, but he outdoes his contemporaries by bringing them on the road with him as well.<br /><br />Indeed, \\"Make It Mine\\" and \\"No Stopping Us,\\" a slice of ear candy from his debut album, sizzle with high-octane energy courtesy of Mraz's scintillating trumpeters. Non-album track \\"1000 Things\\" invokes a lush, lullaby-like dream state, and \\"Fall Through Glass,\\" a duet with Mraz's friend Bushwalla, teems with swing and intrigue. Along with Mraz's clowning stage presence and impressive vocal range, these moments creates a thoroughly unique musical experience.<br /><br />To be sure, re-releases from major labels are always highly polished cash grabs, and this one is no different.

0141439831|3.0|After finishing, I mostly felt like I just slogged through the novel out of duty instead of excitement. The characters in general are very entertaining, and the variety of their situations truly is fascinating. And it is a joy to get immersed in that era, with its cultural and economic strata so deliciously scandalized. But, it just felt very long, with one situation after another feeling drawn out. Perhaps I missed a sense of psychological complexity in the characters that I appreciate in Dostoevsky. And his writing style is very direct but not poetic in itself. And I didn't like his first-person narrative commentaries.    Overall, it's an entertaining epic, and I loved the depiction of that society most of all.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout, very intense.  I'm not sure I'd recommend for brand new beginners, but it's definitely something to work towards. She does give beginner versions of most of the exercises though. I consider myself advanced when it comes to fitness/weight lifting, and this dvd gives me a run for my  money.  Jillian kicks my butt as always (I have most of her videos) with this no fluff workout, and I love it.  Because each workout is only 20 minutes long, you will work every minute of it, and you'll hate her after only a few minutes into it, but you'll love yourself for pushing through it in the end.  The workouts are very similar to those given in her Making the Cut book (which is a great book, and also gave me awesome results), only tailored to fit into a smaller segment of time w/no rest in between.  If you're looking to take your fitness to another level, I'd highly recommend it.   I don't care what people say, I love Jillian!
B0009W5JR8|2.0|I haven't seen the original [[ASIN:B00005JL3K xXx]] but I'm doing my best not to be prejudiced by the lazy mediocrity that is its sequel. As big and competitive as the modern action/adventure genre is, \\"State of the Union\\" brings surprisingly little to the table, with promises of big fights, big guns, big shootouts, and big excitement left unfulfilled by a director (Lee Tamahori, [[ASIN:B001EDVNNU Die Another Day]]) who seems to have thought that simply putting rapper/actor Ice Cube into the starring role would be good enough to account for everything the film lacks. When judged against everything else that was and is on the market, \\"Union\\" brought a peashooter to a gunfight and was swiftly and rightfully forgotten by most folks.<br /><br />The story: when the xXx program is infiltrated by an insurrectionist splinter faction headed by a corrupt general (Willem Dafoe, [[ASIN:B00005JKCH Spider-Man]]), a new agent is chosen in the form of an incarcerated Navy SEAL (Ice Cube, [[ASIN:B002O3Z4Z2 Three Kings]]). With aid from both new and returning allies, he must uncover the insurgents from within to thwart a plot to overthrow the US government and assassinate the president.<br /><br />As I understand it, the original film's premise was to mix action with extreme sports. \\"State of the Union\\" has no such foundation. It's simply your run-of-the-mill \\"gotta-stop-the-bad-guys\\" take that has been done about a thousand times throughout cinema history. Absolutely nothing about the film stands out: no high-risk stunts, no extraordinary special effects, no revolutionary characters, nothing. I can't help but go on about how little and how bland of action the film has to show. There are approximately two hand-to-hand fights, about the same number of shootouts, a car chase or two, and a somewhat cool encounter between two tanks - the lot of them almost completely by the book. Ice Cube makes a decent (if somewhat stereotyped) action hero, but with so little to work with, he's got no chance to live up to Vin Diesel.<br /><br />There's nothing much to fall back on: with the exception of the performance of Samuel Jackson ([[ASIN:1558908242 Pulp Fiction]]), there's nothing beyond decent that Dafoe, Scott Speedman ([[ASIN:B0000VAFO0 Underworld]]), Peter Strauss ([[ASIN:6300151875 The Jericho Mile]]), Xzibit, or Nona Gaye ([[ASIN:B00005JKMQ Ali]]) bring to the table, and there's no meaningful underlying message or even particularly good humor to divert our attention. While the movie is competently made, technically, it feels nothing short of toothless. Before the end of the first half, you'll have seen just about everything there is to see, and unless the producers choose both a different star and a more competent writer, there'll be little reason to look forward to for the inevitable \\"xXx 3\\".<br /><br />Unless you're a fan of either Ice Cube, Xzibit, or a particularly diehard fan of Sam the Man, there'll be no need to pick up this poorly-conceived actioneer. The two stars you see at the top of this review acknowledge that the film was shot in English and was in focus; if I were basing my review on how memorable the flick was, it'd get less than one star.Vin Diesel.

I definitely recommend that any fan of the book or the show to watch the entire season.  The only thing that can hold me over until next season is going to be the dvd's!  So glad it is coming back to HBO for another (and hopefully more) round!
B00003CX8Y|4.0|This will be a Christmas gift so I haven't actually watched it yet.  However, I am pleased with the timeliness of the shipping. The dvd looks to be in great shape. The price was about what I expected.  Overall, all has been great.  I just couldn't give the 5 stars yet because I haven't actually watched it.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Even tho it's from the 50's and in B&W (a turnoff for a lot of people) the movie is wonderful, the scenes are still fresh & funny; delightful scenes of Rome and Life in the 50's. She stays all night, still a virgin in the morning?  everyone isn't having sex with everyone on camera?  No one gets MURDERED??? no gore? Believe it or not, if a film is written and acted brilliantly - and here you have 3 of the great actors of all time -- a movie doesn't need shock value to be great, and this film proves it!
B000000OAH|5.0|Layers of talent, varied content, completely original and fun. This is Queen at their best. No one has heard this album before (I just got it myself for the first time) and that makes it a great find. Buy it and enjoy it (Mustapha!Mustapha!). Awesome stuff.  I literally can't stop playing the damn thing, it's making my girlfriend nuts!  I only wish there were more Queen albums to discover.
B000002C2E|4.0|As is typical with Dylan,if there is at least one or two really good selections on the album it is worth it.....my two favorites are \\"It's not dark yet\\" and \\"Standing in the Doorway\\".   J.K.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Our whole family (ages 21-53) could not wait for the next episode when this aired on HBO. Just a very well thought out and presented life of a presidential family we never paid all that much attention to. BRAVO.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh groban sings so amzing. I am his biggest fan ever, and I love this cd, closer. It shows his ability to sing very well and I love his song called confession. He sings that song very well. I also love songs, in her eyes and so she dances. Becides being very cute his voice maches his looks + better. He is so amazing! I highly recamend this cd
031606792X|5.0|I loved the twilight saga, can't wait for this last book to become a movie.  The book had a lot of depth to it, and ended very well.  I love that edward and bella got their fairy tale, that's what they deserved.  Never like the whole Jacob triangle thing until the end when he destined for her daughter...I love Edward Cullen!
B00005QGAT|5.0|it seems like the good old days are gone,I met some very nice girls when this album came out.these were the days of club life,the real good times. Nice times.
B00003CXB4|1.0|this lion king platinum edition was scratched and was useless to me. I found out once I opened the movie package.   janet kaplan
B001LRJH0U|4.0|\\"Appaloosa\\" combines the best of traditional and modern Westerns. Ed Harris, who directs as well as stars in the film, has created a great combination of the two perpectives in this adaptation of the Robert B. Parker (Spenser For Hire) novel.<br /><br />Harris plays Virgil Cole, who with his partner Everett Hitch (played by Viggo Mortensen), roams the West as hired guns who come in and tame towns where lawlessness reigns. Such is the case in Appaloosa, which is run by rancher Randall Bragg, who killed the town marshal (an old friend of Cole's) and his two deputies. Cole and Hitch begin the cleanup process straightaway, but everything becomes complicated with the appearance in town of Allison French (played by Renee Zellweger), a young widow who captures the heart of crusty Cole and soon, the hardened lawman moves in on her. But later, she comes on Hitch, setting the stage for issues of life, future, and loyalty to be explored while the lawmen deal with the woman and the wily Bragg, who has a few tricks up his sleeve.<br /><br />The look, feel, and the tone feels very traditional, but the screenplay and action are more modern in their staging, which means the language is saltier, and the action faster, just as it would be in real life. Harris and Mortensen seem like they have been acting in Westerns their entire career. Zellweger hits the right notes as a woman  who does what she has to do to survive.<br /><br />This is a great film, and one that most Western fans should readily enjoy.
0670020745|5.0|After watching Jill on Oprah, I couldn't wait to read her book.  When I received it,my husband picked it up and began reading it.  Together we have enjoyed this awesome journey.  Her insights are amazing and really helped us understand her struggle.
B00002DE0S|5.0|These performances of the two Chopin concertos by the great Polish pianist and his hand-picked group of young Warsaw players constitute one of the great CDs in my extensive collection. Zimerman and company find revelatory complexity in these often shallowly played romantic pieces. The range of color, the beautiful instrumental sound, the light-footed gravitas - this is an astonishing achievement, Chopin made new.
B000069AUI|5.0|It may not transcend [[ASIN:B00004U9MS Parachutes]], but this is a very decent sophomore effort.  Sure it's mopey; sure it's resigned.  That's the whole point.  The question then becomes, how well does it achieve its goal to mope you out?  Well, as it turns out it's pretty damn effective in that department.<br /><br />Most of the songs are mid-tempo, with lots of dynamic shifts and volume-tweaking.  Coldplay have been criticized as being Radiohead Lite (for one thing) but that isn't really true.  Coldplay is a lot more melodic than Radiohead; more conventionally \\"pretty.\\"  While that may sound like proof of the very charge, I think the comparison is made more for the quality and timbre of Chris Martin's voice.  The similarity to Thom Yorke's voice is sometimes uncanny.<br /><br />There are some problems, though.  Sequencing \\"Daylight\\" immediately after the beautiful, shimmering \\"Clocks\\" was a mistake as although they are structurally different they have virtually identical rhythms.  Great songs both, particularly the former, but a little close for comfort.  Another problem (not a serious one, however) is the pacing of the rest of the album.  As I said, most of the songs are mid tempo and some (\\"Green Eyes,\\" \\"Warning Sign,\\" \\"In My Place\\") even have a quasi-country lilt to them which is nice, but there's a certain sameness that gets to be distracting:  instead of just losing yourself in the lushness of it all, you might find yourself critiquing it instead.  Like here.<br /><br />But when it's good, A RUSH is great.  \\"Clocks,\\" \\"A Whisper\\" (particularly the coda), \\"God Put A Smile On Your Face\\" are all required listening . . . in fact, nothing on this album is anything less than very good.  Oddly, however, I find the title track to be the weakest of the bunch, mainly because of its length (nearly six minutes).<br /><br />So, I keep coming back to this album - - more so than to the debut.  I didn't like it much at first. But there's a certain closeness to it - - a certain confessional quality I find compelling.  So . . . I guess it transcends PARACHUTES after all.mpelling.  So . . . I guess it transcends PARACHUTES after all.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|Hellboy 2 continues the story of Hellboy and his work with a paranormal agency. He is still surrounded by friends and a new leader who reminds me of the Brain of Morbius from Doctor Who. What transpires during the film is a battle of the Earth between Humans and Elves/Goblins/Ogres/Trolls, and Humans are almost wiped out by the Elves Golden Army of giant robots. But in a moment of compassion the King of the Elves decides to not finish off the remaining Humans and calls a truce that Humans may build their cities but leave the forests to the Elves and Trolls. Years pass and humans have forgotting the truce and have taking over to much of the Elves and Trolls land. The prince of the Elves has decided his Father is to weak to do anything about the Humans and decides it's time to wake the Golden Army again.  Filled with tons of action and a mean twist on what it is like to be different, Hellboy 2 delivers the goods.  Also included are the following special features: 6 deleted scenes, Troll Market Tour, Commentary, set visits and an epilogue animated comic.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Great album from Paul and Youth. Paul always seems to shine when he takes on a different persona and just lets loose.
B000002AS3|5.0|On the occasion of the release of the band's seventh full length cd I thought that I would pull out all of their cds and re-assess each one. In doing so I must first admit that the combination of a series of disappointing records, childish in-fighting, idiotic public pronouncements and generally boorish and juvenile behaviour have not exactly endeared these lads to me over the last decade and a half. So, let me wipe clean the slate and, as George Michael once suggested, listen without prejudice.<br /><br />This is most definitely English music. Oasis has always worn its influences on it sleeves - Beatles, most obviously, but also Stones, Kinks, Small Faces. This \\"Englishness\\" is a logical reason why certain British artists have been less successful in the US than at home and else ware. Starting with the great Small Faces in the 60's and continuing through Queen in the 70's and 80's to The Arctic Monkeys more recently there has been a long line of Brit bands that have been tremendously successful at home and less so on the southern half of this continent. From the beginning of rock and roll I have always recognized a musical hall or theatrical element in much of the popular music from the UK. I suspect that for many in the potential American audience this is off-putting. To the American ear these artists can sound affected or pretentious and are therefore often described as poseurs. To the British ear, and indeed the Australian and Canadian as well,  they are merely continuing a long recognized and much revered tradition. I may be totally out to lunch on this one. However, there has to be a logical reason why, over the course of over forty years, a slew of bands who were immensely popular in the UK struggled to make headway in the US but were able to carry that popularity to, for instance, Canada. The aforementioned Queen, Supertramp and Genesis are other examples. Now I do appreciate that each of these bands had varying degrees of popularity in the US. However, they were each much more successful in Britain AND in Canada. It isn't the accent! We up here in the Great White North sound much more American than we do English - even if we tend to use English spelling!<br /><br />Maybe starts of with the snarling rocker Rock `n' Roll Star. The record never lets up. Live Forever is one of my favourite anthems from the 90's. Supersonic is another driving, snarling, gem that, like many of the band's best songs, has silly lyrics but is ideal for screaming along with at parties or alone in the car. After its initial and welcome excitement, grunge, like most \\"new things\\" in music, became repetitive and lost its way. Straight ahead rockers like Bring it on Down and Cigarettes and Alcohol were therefore a breath of fresh air. Slide Away, the penultimate song, is another anthemic party piece. The album closes with Married With Children - just the kind of innocuous but catchy little ditty in which The Beatles specialized.<br /><br />Definitely Maybe is a sterling debut album. To me it is cleaner and less cluttered than the later releases (purely subjective observations of course). The variety of the music and the brevity of the recording allow the listener to play the entire thing without any risk of the onset of boredom - something that, regretfully, I cannot say of their post 1995 catalog. The band's second effort is even better. Therefore I'll give this one four and a half stars and save full marks for Morning Glory.ch much more successful in Britain AND in Canada.

B001LMRCP2|5.0|For Coldplay fans this is more of the same; an ability to add variety while keeping their consistent sound.  They diversify a bit with the LOST track here with Jay-Z.  I thought that could have been better but is good in a different way nonetheless.<br /><br />The track Postcards from Far Away is just awesome piano and really goes well with this EP.<br /><br />Overall I'm thankful that the band released the album so quickly after Viva La Vida (following such a long layoff) and for Amazon selling it for $0.99...what a great deal.
B000006YO2|5.0|Thank-you for sending me this album, I still buy vinyls and it came just fine.  I put it on right away as I missed hearing Bryan Ferry.  All my friends and I were listening and enjoying it so much.    Thanks again,    Tina
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I caught a song from this artist on a taping of \\"Eli Stone\\", researched it and ordered and so very glad I did.  I adore this man's sound; the whole package!!  I will be definately be ordering additional words from him.  I also received my order sooner than expected, which only let me enjoy to tunes quicker and with more gratitude!
0439023483|5.0|This book was very exciting from the beginning. I had a really hard time putting it down. The characters were really good and I hope she does a follow up on this one so I can see exactly where all the characters went after the book.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This used to be on television about a hundred times a year until somebody realized that it diminished its value.  Now rarely on tv, this dvd is an entertaining, heart-warming story.  It only takes a viewing of this movie spectacular to put me right in the mood for Christmas.  James Stewart plays George Bailey who has led his entire life giving of himself to help others when a banking error by his uncle could end it all for poor George.    An angel comes to his rescue and shows George what life would have been without him.  With the beautiful Donna Reed as his wife and gruff and mean Mr. Potter played by the highly talented Lionel Barrymore, this dvd is a must for any collection, and epecially any library of Christmas classics.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Pros:  -great characters, curious and quirky  -deep and meaningful messages  -burn-e short brings a whole new perspective to the same timeframe of events from the eyes a fellow robot  -brilliant production values  -intricate details and visual effects approach realism  -tidbits of funny pixar references and trivia  -as always, amazing sound sound effects fill your surround sound and music is fitting and catchy/enjoyable    Cons:  -live actor appearances should have been computer animated  -slow for impatient viewers, won't get the message through because there's more heart than laughter    pixar tries to reach out to audiences by addressing trash and consumerism, but falls short of delivering a lasting impact. it's interesting to see the future imagined as a mindless material land, not too far off from what would happen if our society continues in its wastefulness. my only hope is that people do get the message to give back and get out of our consumer ruts.    wall-e is the most dominantly human character of the story. the other robots are cute and entertaining, but less relatable. wall-e as a non-human reminds me of little mermaid and johnny 5, collecting fascinating trash even while not knowing its use. you discover wall-e's curiosity and loneliness are the core of his survival and ingenuity, but also fuel is hunger for contact and a companion to share his treasures with.     it's sad that pixar narrows their audience with their wall-e gamble. many will find it too deep/slow to be a pick up and watch, but true older fans will admire and love every part this movie and extras have to offer. it is another priceless pixar disney feature that no future robot would ever find in my trash.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|This movie is hugely underrated, and often poorly misrepresented. At least it appears so from a lot of these reviews.  Perhaps as others have said, it was and still is marketed incorrectly, as some believe the absence of \\"War-like Violence\\" leaves much to be desired.  But define war?? At least in its true, non text book sense and this movie will speak volumes.  It's an incredibly intelligent, poignant and heartbreakingly honest film, driven by 'the wait' for an enemy that never emerged.   Perhaps our ignorance for such a film proves our ignorance towards the true mechanisms and often extreme waste that war is.  Mission to kill?  We seem to forget the stories of those who did nothing but kill time in the desert.   As the film concludes; \\"He will always remain, a jarhead. And all the jarheads, killing and dying, they will always be me...  We are still in the desert\\"  5 stars...  If you're intelligent enough to understand it, you'll never forget it
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele is ridiculously talented and gifted with a set of pipes that would make Aretha do a double take.  She puts it all on show on \\"19\\".  Both the original compositions and Dylan cover showcase her range and, mature beyond her years, emotional depth.  The comparisons to Amy Winehouse are inappropriate; I don't think the two are after the same sound.  Winehouse is all about mining the girl group doo wap of the Supremes, et al. to accompany her frank, sometimes debauched lyrics.  (I suppose she thinks she's being gritty)  Adele doesn't dwell on the base with her lyrics mostly of love, requited and not.  The album is made up of ballads and jazz-like numbers that are punctuated by heavy bass.   The instrumentation is often spare - all the better to highlight her outstanding voice, which is an instrument in itself.  If this is what she can do at age 19, I can't wait to see what the future holds for her and the listening public.

B001DTPZNY|1.0|This is another example of George Lucas getting lost in his own head and ruining a perfect, simple action franchise. The straightforward, world-traveling exploits of Dr. Jones are gone. In their stead is a movie with bland settings, meaningless fights, bad CG, and a leading man who seems like he's delivering his lines at gunpoint.<br /><br />If you love the Indy franchise, and somehow managed not to see this one yet, do yourself a favor: pretend it doesn't exist.
B001G5IJVK|1.0|There.  I said it.  We've been angry...for so long...over the lack of new material...and their exclusion from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Their (or their record company's) insistence on re-packing old material is the reason Kiss is now dead.  They do NOT belong in the Hall of Fame if this is the best they can give us over the past 8 years...re-packaging of old (albeit classic) Kiss song is not the way to continued success.  KISS is dead.  The \\"current\\" Kiss is a tribute band--and when Gene and Paul are dead, KISS is going to try to keep going on as some sort of weird Barnum and Bailey's Circus...where they keep the circle going with \\"new\\" members...we're, hopefully, not this stupid.  Don't give them ANY more of your money.  STOP!
B00005JNX0|5.0|I have seen this movie more than I can count, and I laugh hysterically everytime! Each animal character has their own issues (personal baggage). The hypochondriac giraffe; the conceited lion, a charming hippo and a zebra with a low self-esteem. I can't listen to \\"Staying Alive\\" anymore without picturing Marty, the Zebra, sashaying down the city streets, to the beat..We still find ourselves quoting the penguins, \\"smile and wave boys, smile and wave\\"...The animation is perfect for kids, but the inside jokes and innuendos are classic adult! I highly recommend purchasing this movie! I can't get enough! Madagascar 2 is hilarious as well! Can't wait to get that on DVD also!
B000LE16VW|5.0|[[ASIN:B000LE16VW Ghost (Special Collector's Edition)]]<br />Its hard to imagine virile, very-much alive PATRICK SWAYZE as a ghost. But that's what he becomes when he is shot by a mugger while walking home with girl-friend DEMI MOORE. Swayze can't figure why he's been left to roam the earth, but it doesn't take him long to work out that he's there for a purpose and that's to protect DEMI from those who had his killing rigged to look like a casual shoot-and-run affair. This isn't easy ( as DEMI can't see or hear him and he can't move objects ) until he latches on to a PSYCHIC (WHOOPI GOLDBERG) and takes lessons in telekinesis from a sub-way Ghost, VINCENT SCHIAVELLI. Whoopi isn't enthusiastic: Why don't you get some chains and find a house to haunt? she complains. But Swayze makes himself a nuisance enough to force her hand. This film, could have made a first-rate off-beat romantic thriller (and even more money); for the reason it's only effective in patches. Look no further than the running time, far too much is spent in pseudo-erotic moonings. Never mind, enjoy the thriller plot (though the villain isn't difficult to spot), the special effects and WHOOPI GOLDBERG'S lively, ACADEMY AWARD WINNING, performance.
0321544080|3.0|I very much enjoy looking through this book and in a few years may understand more of it's contents.  There are many terms I have not yet experienced, although I've been a camera buff for around a decade.  It appears to be very informative and I look forward to future use.
0670020745|5.0|This book is a must-buy for anyone who has suffered a stroke and for their family and friends.  It offers an outstanding description and understanding of aspects of strokes and the aftermaths.  If this could be rated a 5+++++ - I would do it!
1401219268|5.0|This book is on Times 100 Best Novels since 1923 for a reason, it is one of the best stories I've ever read.  An avid comic book fan since youth, this story is unlike any comic or graphic novel I've ever read, chock full of text, thought provoking ideas, and a theme that adapts itself to todays society, this book paved the way for modern comics and comic book movies.  There never would have been a Dark Knight or Civil War without this groundbreaking novel.  This edition is beautifully rendered in high-quality glossy pages, and as nice as the dust jacket is, the true beauty of this product lies beneath it, a handsome faux-leather binding with a clock set appropriately set 10 to midnight clock on the front in high contrast yellow.  I recommend this to anyone who had ever enjoyed reading  a novel or comic book.  So good it will astound your average novel reader who is reading \\"comics\\" for the first time.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Our copy of The Lion King had gone missing and this one is just as good!
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|All I can say is it's their best \\"live\\" effort since \\"Exit Stage Left.\\" Saw both legs of the tour live and this was just as good IMO. Lifeson has found his tone again and is playing the best I've ever seen him, Geddy's vocals are \\"spot on\\" and Neil is well just... the best rock drummer of all time. Anymore more words would be a waste....    But the DVD buy the CD, you're not going to find better work out there by anybody anytime soon. Yeah, it's that good.
B001F12J48|1.0|Whatever happened to this dvd.The 3D  is apalling in the close ups with double images all the time.Like those 50's 3D films I used to watch.The background is okay  in 3D however. Why wasn't it  done properly in the transfer to dvd?
B00006LSM3|5.0|This album just may be the most heartfelt and spiritual recording by any artist released in the new millennium. SENSATIONAL from start to finish. Thank you George for many years of inspirational and spiritual music, see you after I'm done too living in the material world. PEACE.
B0018M6J90|4.0|MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY is a sweet, appealing way to spend a lazy afternoon.  Set in London at the onset of WWII, MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY tells the story of two very different women whose paths cross briefly, making a huge impact in each other lives.  This film leaves you feeling happy, with a big smile on your face.<br /><br />Amy Adams and Frances McDormand are perfect foils for each other.  Amy Adams plays the young, carefree, morally questionable, gorgeous young starlet (Delysia Lafosse); Frances McDormand is the plain, unassuming daughter of a clergyman, who makes a rather unsuccessful living as a governess (Miss Pettigrew).  Miss Pettigrew has just been fired from another job, and Delysia finds herself in multiple romantic entanglements.  The two women find each other, and each makes a big difference in the life of the other.  Delysia Lafosse learns what she wants most in her heart, and Miss Pettigrew learns to live.  In the end, both get everything that they deserve.<br /><br />The performances from the entire cast are very pleasing, each person playing their somewhat stereotypical characters to a tee.  The costuming is perfect for the period and simply lovely; I really enjoyed all the clothes in this one.  The cinematography is muted and soft, working very nicely for the time period portrayed.  Overall, this is a very well done film.<br /><br />A cross between Cinderella and Pygmalion, MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY is a thoroughly enjoyable film, a charmer for the whole family.  A real life fairy tale that leaves you contented and satisfied, everyone lives happily ever after.  Which is exactly what you want.
B000JCEUE6|4.0|This album is great. The sound quality, perfect. The only problem is changing the record every 5 minutes. The bonus song is good and songs like \\"Missing Frame\\" and \\"Prelude 12/21\\" sound fantastic.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This dvd is still amazing. I really enjoy the quality of the movie. I liked how it is restored. The special features are great too. Just be careful about the digital copy. Disney forgot to include my code so I could access the digital copy. But besides that, I really enjoyed my purchase. I can't wait to watch it again. Love it!

0385340990|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as it gave me an insight of what it may have been like in Guernsey during WWII.  I read and listened to the book, and the readers were excellent!<br /><br />This book is great to take on a trip, as you can read it in pieces and still follow all the characters.<br /><br />This book would make a great gift for any holiday and if a movie ever comes out - it will be a great \\"chick\\" flick.
0670020745|5.0|It is seldom a patient has such total recall of such a horrific event and I found her story fascinating.  Perhaps the most enlightening part was to discover the difference between the left and right brain and how we really do have more control than we might have imagined.    This is a book I will lend but not give away!  I want to be able to refer to it in the future.
B00129H7VS|5.0|These extraordinary (yet excruciating, raw, violent and emotional) episodes capture in an incredible narrative the ups, downs, glory, horrors, trials and tribulations of common men becoming soldiers and enduring what has become known as the Last Great War.    Like Saving Private Ryan before it, this Mini-Series tries to put you in the middle of the daily wear and tear of this war. But this time, not in a small unit to save one man, which can be viewed as an exception in the great scheme of the war, but as one more soldier in the middle of the \\"great and noble undertaking\\" that was World War II. Great and noble, yes, but also not an easy one as Eisenhower told the D-Day troops: \\"Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle hardened, he will fight savagely.\\"    Coincidentally or by Providence, the same dedicated people behind that Saving Private Ryan, fascinated by the accounts of these real-life soldiers (found on the book Band of Brothers by author Steven Ambrose), decided to spare no expense to bring this incredibly real, and incredibly raw in the human scale, story to life. Now in blu ray, this Mini-Series begin to get the respect it deserves. Though, in my humble opinion, this series should one day be presented in cinemas.    There is definitely R-Rated material here. Children need not be exposed to the war in order to avoid it. But teens and youths sometimes do forget that their freedoms costs; so this is, I think, great material to see and explore together with parents and gives excellent chances to engage in fascinating and profound conversations about war, life, principle, and definitely, God with their kids. This particular Mini-Series, focuses on the day-to-day hardships that a man must endure in this life; some days are good, some are bad, some better, some worse, some simply extraordinary. Some things are worth fighting for, even dying for; but it is equally important to be clear on WHO, WHAT and WHY we are fighting or dying for.    The Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan, many other great WWII films, and now this superlative Mini-Series in all the glory of High Definition.     May all these help us NEVER forget that simple men are capable of accomplishing world-changing feats.
B001E75QGG|5.0|Great movie for the real Indiana Jones fan.  It's great to see Harisson Ford back as Indiana.  The movie is filled with special effects and you should really see it in Blu-Ray (on a full HD or HD ready screen).  The sound is also very good!!   You won't regret this purchase.
0385340990|3.0|Obviously well-researched and beautifully written, this book of letters transports the reader to Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands belonging to Britian, during the time of the German invasion.  The island characters are immediately likable although it is initially hard to keep them straight.  The islanders escape some of the hardship when on the spur of the moment, Elizabeth initiates a reading group.  Because the invaders and locals share the isolation and face the same difficulties, it is understandable that the lines blur.  The story becomes more interesting as this happens.  While the historical anecdotes and references were believable, the characters became overly sacchrine and unreal and by the end I was happy to put this book down.

1416594884|5.0|After a while, spy novels can seem somewhat formulaic and routine, even when they tackle post-Cold War subjects such as \\"The War on Terror.\\"  \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" was a great read due to its complete unpredictability and originality.      A bizarre, young half-Chechen man named Issa arrives in Hamburg and almost immediately complicates the lives of an incongruous group of people while also arousing the suspicions of several theoretically cooperating espionage organizations from different countries.  Hearing his \\"back story\\" from diverse perspectives reveals the paranoia - not wholly unwarranted - that has evolved since 9/11.  Which contacts with which Muslim groups are suspicious?  How reliable is \\"evidence\\" adduced from torture?  How does the torture affect the victim's behavior in that, if they weren't a terrorist before, would they become one in response?    Early in the story an idealistic young human rights lawyer agrees to try to help Issa, whose plight in Germany seems pretty dire.  He claims to be the heir of a Russian officer who had a stash of money secreted away in a private bank in Hamburg.  Shortly thereafter the naive lawyer and banker get caught up in the machinations of international spy networks, all of whom think they know the \\"true\\" situation and/or threat of danger.  It is scary to see how they project their biases on their interpretaions of events (e.g., someone who is lost and backtracks must be trying to evade a tail).    Most of the characters are well-developed and, within the confines of the suspended reality of the story, believable.    I hate spoiler reviews, so I won't say much more.  However, I couldn't put the book down for the last 100 pages or so, even as dinner guests arrived.  (Definitely don't get yourself into that dilemma, is all I can say!)
B000022TSY|1.0|You can watch this movie on fast forward and not miss anything. This movie is WAY over-rated... It might have been great to some people in its day - but that is now almost 40 years ago. Anyone who hasn't seen it, dont waste your time. The longer time passes the worse this movie will get. I watched it because it was a \\"famous\\" movie but as many of the older famous movies are, they just are on a completely lower level than todays great movies.

B001GZ6QDS|1.0|the fact that everyone thinks that heath ledger made a good joker is unbelievable it just shows that no one has seen the batman made in the early 90's starring jack nicholson, i will admit that christian bale has made some good movies (equilibrium for example) but this is sad that heath ledgers final performace was so bad.  the man is a good actor but his portrayel of the joker was completely and utterly wrong in keeping with the actual character from the comic books. he looks different acts different and does not use tactics as crude as the ones that they had him using in this farce
1596434252|4.0|The video preview of the book is very convincing and so is the price. That´s why I ordered 2 of the books, just in case. I was then a bit disappointed by the sometimes grubby manufacture. One of both covers had a stripe of sticky glue on one side and the overall handling is not as easy as in the video. But well, pop-up books involve a complicated technique, especially if you want to include exciting effects. This is not a book you \\"read\\" everyday, so I think it simply is a nice collectors piece for everyone interested in playful graphical objects. Just get one (or two), the price is hilarious and the idea gorgeous!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|[[ASIN:B0002F6AH0 The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)]]  I have purchased many DVDs about WW2 and this one sits near or at the top of the list. The 50 minute episodes make it easy to keep track of the many events during WW2. The episodes are interesting and informative. The series has excellent footage and the narration by Sir Laurence Olivier is top notch. The recent price reduction really makes it an exceptional value. I think it is a \\"must\\" purchase for any WW2 or history buff.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I love this book!  I am 20 years old and I read this book in the 8th grade.  It was awesome.  I have read it, along with the rest of the trilogy every summer since then.  It has everything I love about book taking you away in a fantasy world.  I liked how there was a love story under the main story line.  I still recommend this book to my family and friends who want to add a great book to their collection.  You will not be disappointed!  At least I hope not :)<br />~EG
B000FDFVZ6|1.0|Like many others, i was so incredibly intrigued by the opening sentences.  I read so many raving reviews so i just had to read this book.  As I read the book I became more and more depressed.  I was hoping so badly that it would get better or that there woudl be some sort of resolution but there never was.  It was horrible. Don't waste your time or your money.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|AC/DC has been a band to stay on course with the music of it's preceding album since 2000's Stiff Upper Lip.    Eight years later, Black Ice is no different.    As the 100th reviewer for Black Ice, standard edition, I bring you my review.    Each of the songs here remind me of the combination of several AC/DC tracks post Back In Black. Depending of your personal tastes pertaining to the diversity in your music, you will see this Black Ice as a \\"thankfully they never change\\" band or a \\"no, not another one of their old albums again\\" band. I'd go with the former, simply because there aren't too many groups that have been around 20+ years who stay on track like AC/DC does.     I won't reminisce on each song, only the stand out ones, because there are a few on here. Good solos by Angus Young, but Malcom Young really stands out on this album with his rhythmic guitar riffs.     The opening track, the 1st single, Rock N Roll Train, is the one everyone is familiar with now. It is such a great track, and my favorite on here. Great opening hook, killer riffs, and outstanding chorus sung by Brian and the brothers. Love the intro kick of the solo before the 2nd chorus finishes. Short, but in-your-face.     The next track, Skies of Fire, another of my favorites off here, begins with Phill Rudd's drum and cymbal beats. Malcom starts off the song with an interesting riff. Solo mediocre, but the brother makes up for it. The song reminds me of an older AC/DC track with Brian on vocals, but I can't put my finger on it now for the life of me. Sorry.    Next we have Big Jack. The song immediately grabs you, another in-your-face beat. Brian wastes no time starting up the 1st verse. This songs wants to make me sing Big Guns!! One of many that I feel end too early.     War Machine, the fifth track is my favorite behind Rock N Roll train, quite possibly a future single. This song really gets your head banging after the song fades in. It begins with a Cliff bass riff, reminisant to Live Wire....or possible even The Jack.     Two tracks later, we have Spoilin For A Fight. Excellent rhythm section thanks to Malcom and Cliff. Though many AC/DC songs serve for good bar songs, this one climbs toward the top, in comparison with many of their others. Bar fight anyone?     And what's an AC/DC album without singing about a girl? She Likes To Rock N Roll is just that. I personally like girls who rock n roll, but that's beside the review here.     Rock and Roll Dream also stands out. Another favorite of mine and a different style of the stylistic AC/DC present throughout the album.     The title track, Black Ice is stuck at the end, and serves as not a bad closer to the album. Song a little short in my opinion, but their songs did get shorter over the years.     As far as the rest, like I mentioned, I only described the stand out tracks, briefly, but not to imply the rest aren't good. Overall, another typical upbeat album featuring partying, and rocking. Not so much booze these days, but that's alright. No darker material, like Hells Bells, except maybe the title track at the end. I'd have to say the Young brothers & co. are in good form here. Brian can still sing like he did 20 years ago, and he's over 60! The musicians themselves rock like they used to as well, though I would expect a little more from Angus. But that's my opinion. Good job guys! Great record!!
B00080Z53O|4.0|There is no question that this movie is a work of art; it represents a powerful slice of life. What disturbed me about this film was not so much the message, but the way it was told. Ramon Sampedro, a poet, has been injured and left a parapalegic, and is thus convinced that life for him no longer has value. His crippled condition eclipses all else, and he is consumed with a desire to end his life. I I have to question if this is truly death with dignity--what is dignified about determining the worth of human life by these standards? Does a parapalegic have no dignity? But on another level, I saw a very stacked argument being played out: those who were pleading for Sampedro to see more to his life, who saw the possiblity for his art to carry on, were all portrayed as backward morons, while those who fought for his right to die were the only ones who seemed to have intelligence and empathy. I far preferred [[ASIN:B00104QSOC The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]], also a powerful film of high artistic quality (you see his life through his eyes, literally)--the main character is also a parapalegic who struggles with his condition, and yet he grabs what life he has left, and gives a far different meaning to \\"death with dignity.\\" If you watch The Sea Inside, you should also see The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, and compare the lives of these two men.
B000M53GM2|5.0|This is the first Brosnan Bond picture I've seen.  I actually tried watching it, and was bored by the point he reached the hotel casino, but decided to try it again.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This was an above average Bond movie.  It will not replace my favorites (\\"Diamonds Are Forever\\", \\"You Only Live Twice\\", \\"Man With A Golden Gun\\", and \\"For Your Eyes Only\\"), but it belongs in the group picture.<br /><br />Being a \\"Remington Steele\\" fan, I'm not surprised to see Brosnan succeed in this role.  My favorite of the bad guys was Bruno; he was a riot.<br /><br />The back of the DVD commented on the eye-popping opening sequence.  My hunch is it was talking about a stunt that was as spectacular as the necessary suspension of disbelief -- could that have happened in real life?  I doubt it.
B001ESYAJY|4.0|OK, here's this James bond film and the soundtrack is missing the James bond theme. In the movie, it gets played with the end titles, so I guess 007's been replaced with some art director's idea of a better cut.<br /><br />No matter, the score is richly blended instrumental stuff with plenty of power and deep bass. Arnold's score punctuates the film's action nicely, but is far more provocative as a stand-alone soundtrack CD.<br /><br />SOLACE is a joyless film full of latest-fad editing and not enough plot to wipe itself with. The score on this CD is part of the best of SOLACE. Great work and worth listening to while driving one's Aston Martin.
0596522347|1.0|I had high hopes for this book. It looks very nice. It has the right nods to Tufte early on. But...     But the true content is very thin, includes a load of chart junk (the anti-Tufte - I guess the true cue is in the title, this is a PowerPoint book) and page after page of abstract diagrams demonstrating \\"flow\\" - much like the woeful second half of \\"Say it with Charts\\" which is about 50 pages of arrows.     Very very disappointing indeed.
0307236722|5.0|I bought this cookbook when it first came out a few years ago and could not be more pleased with it.  What I love about it is that it is the perfect combination of tried and true tips and techniques and mouthwatering recipes.  The result is a book that I turn to not just when I am looking for a great recipe, but also for points of information that will make me a better baker.  It is a very thorough cookbook and I have found that if I am looking for a standard or classic baking recipe, whether sweet or savory, there is a good chance this book will have it.  In addition to this cookbook, I also own [[ASIN:0881505811 The King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion: The All-Purpose Baking Cookbook]], but find that I turn to Martha more often for the following reasons:  -The color pictures.  There are far, far more of these in this book than there are in The King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion.  These not only make the book a more mouthwatering read, but provide great visuals when making the recipe.  -The flawless results.  For me the proof is often in the pudding.  Every recipe I have made from this book has come out as expected which makes it the perfect book to turn to when I am making something for the first time.  I have made her peanut butter sandwich cookies, oatmeal raisin cookies, sugar cookies, royal icing, chocolate scones, challah, english muffins, and one bowl chocolate cupcakes and all were winners.  I think a lot of this is due to the fact that the recipes are clearly well tested and the directions impeccably written.  -Recipes and advice for every skill level.  When I first bought this book I was a beginning baker and found the recipes and tips as relevant as I do now.  I love the fact that as I grow in confidence as a baker there are always more things to learn.    Overall I am thrilled with this cookbook.  However there are some things that other baking books have that this one does not.  For one, The King Arthur Flour cookbooks are great at having nutritionalinformation, even for recipes that are not low fat.  This one does not, but considering how much cream, butter and oil are in these recipes, it is probably all for the best.  This book also tends to lean more towards classic flavor combinations rather than more unusual ones so you're more likely to find fusion-type recipes elsewhere.  Neither of these points take away from its value in my book, which is why it is still a 5-star handbook to me.    Overall, I highly recommend it.  I think it's a great purchase both for new bakers as well as those who are more experienced and interested in honing their skills.  Thanks Martha for such a fantastic resource.
B001HDO4Z6|5.0|Coldplay's new release \\"Prospekt's March,\\" is a collection of b-sides from [[ASIN:B000RPTQ1C Viva La Vida]] and is simply fantastic. From the very first track, \\"Life in Technicolor ii,\\" Coldplay shines. I thought Viva was on of their best albums to date (tough call between it and [[ASIN:B0006L16N8 X&Y]] for my favorite) and its wonderful to have a nice collection of songs in a similar musical style. If you liked Viva, you will probably love this album.<br /><br />These songs are definitely b-sides. They are less polished, but still beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Postcards From Far Away,\\" is a more of a musical interlude between track 1 and 3; sort of a musical 'pallet cleanser.' It is short, sweet, and a little haunting.<br /><br />\\"Glass of Water,\\" is driving, rhythmic, and hopeful, and probably my favorite track. It could easily have made its way onto Viva, and likely will see some air play (or at least it should!).<br /><br />\\"Rainy Day,\\" is a fun song with a sort of \\"Brown Eyed Girl,\\" rhythm to it. It captures something of early sixties pop, but with understated singing and a lovely combination of base, piano and strings.<br /><br />\\"Prospekt's March/Poppyfields,\\" is a slower song, similar to some of the tracks on [[ASIN:0711996067 A Rush of Blood to the Head]] in sound. It is haunting and has interesting lyrics that have caused me to listen to it more than any other song on this album. I'm looking forward to understanding it better.<br /><br />The next two tracks, \\"Lost\\", and \\"Lovers in Japan,\\" are remixes that are enjoyable alternatives to the originals on Viva. I'm not as excited about remixes as some, so while I enjoyed these versions, I was not as engaged with them as the completely new songs.<br /><br />\\"Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground,\\" which is full acoustic, has fantastic lyrics and competes with the 'hidden track,' on X&Y for being one of the most intimate songs Coldplay has ever sung. You feel like you're just hanging with the band while they pick out some chords and write some lyrics. For a band that usually has such tightly wound songs, it feels fantastic. My only complaint is that it is fairly short.<br /><br />One of the things I've always enjoyed about Coldplay is their ability to balance melancholy (\\"The Scientist,\\" \\"In My Place,\\") with joy (\\"Speed of Sound,\\" \\"Yellow\\"). Rarely do they over do things, and this album is no exception. It is well balanced with songs both simple and complex, melancholy and hopefully, always carefully nuanced. Lyrical, and with phrasing as good as bands like the Beatles or U2 (I would contend that in another 10-15 years Coldplay will have the reputation of those legendary bands) their music is powerful and beautiful and amazing.<br /><br />It's been fascinating and enjoyable to watch Coldplay grow and transform as a band in the years since [[ASIN:0711989249 Parachutes]] was released in 2000. I can't wait to see where they go from here with their next studio album.<br /><br />5/5 stars. A must have for any music fan.ually has such tightly wound songs, it feels fantastic.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|McCartney gets slagged down by people who are musical hacks.  Hell, we are all musical hacks compared to him and only a select handful of others.  Yet, despite that fact (oh, I'm sure some people will argue with this statement but it's pretty much an absolute fact), people feel compelled to rip this guy a new one on virtually every album he does.  While most reviews for this brilliant album were very, very positive, I did read a few mediocre reviews and in those, you can tell the reviewer didn't even listen to the album.  Like anything associated with McCartney automatically gets an \\"F\\" grade.  Let's face it, while he has made some mistakes here and there, the guy takes risks and has made better, more impactful songs, whether pop, political, heavy, classical, jazzy, avant garde, new wave, dance, country and blues than almost anyone else on the planet, whether living or dead.  It amazes me how some people can just give this album one star.  Yeah, like you or almost anybody else could do any better.  One star??!! Come on... what a joke!  At WORST, it is a 4 star album... at worst.      The varied songs on this album have so many different treats and varied melodies... The songs range the full gamut and create a wonderful sonic landscape.  'Sing the Changes' probably should be the first single.  From the first track \\"Nothing Too Much\\" to \\"Two Magpies\\" to \\"Highway\\" to \\"Dance 'Til We're High\\" to \\"Lifelong Passion\\", so many genres are covered yet they still maintain the classic McCartney melodic form yet with new twists.  From the Beatles until now, McCartney was never afraid to experiment, he was a musical revolutionary that was barely recognized compared to John... but he certainly should be:  Sgt. Pepper, a declaration of freedom by becoming a new band within the real band, the culmination of climactic sound at the end of A Day in the Life which really supercharges the song into possibly being the Beatles all-time greatest song, the tape loops on Tomorrow Never Knows,writing Helter Skelter which was a bridge to the Heavy Metal movement, the Carnival of Light track, the sound links of Abbey Road Side 2, and even Yesterday which bridged pop and classical music (Beach Boys and the Stones with \\"As Tears Go By\\" helped here as well) were all his contributions.  I'm not knocking John - he was an amazing songwriter and a genius in his own right... but just because we are lucky to still have McCartney alive doesn't mean critics can just kick the guy around and pretty much consistently give him mediocre reviews all the time.  This album is truly special.  And it should be acknowledged that McCartney has had quite a run of late, with Memory Almost Full, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard and now this, we are fortunate to be living during this genius' time on earth.
B0019EXZYE|2.0|The Bank Job has more nudity and blatant semi-porn than any movie I've seen in a while. Unless you're a thirteen year old male, or want to watch porn without the stigma of actually having to rent it, you might find this movie a bit boring. I'm all for period pieces that are free from cliched car chases, violent shoot-em ups, or two-dimensional characters, but sadly this movie lacks the former but without the compelling plot of a true drama. There is a haphazard quality to the film. At times I was expecting it to go the direction of Oceans 11 and be a 'lovable set of criminals' movie where each character contributes their set of skills to accomplish a goal; a sort of criminal 'magnificent seven.' The Bank Job starts down that path, but then abandons it in mid stream.<br /><br />Aside from Jason Stratham's character, all of the criminal gang are faceless and pretty unremarkable in the end. There is little likability among them. Also, the stakes feel fairly low until near the end of the film, when they are jacked through the roof, contributing to the unbalanced quality of the narrative flow. Most importantly, one of the best plot elements is left relatively unexplored: the story of a female MI5 agent who has infiltrated a domestic terrorist organization. Deeper examination of her story would have provided a very interesting parallel to the main action.<br /><br />This is a busting at the seams steam fest with crud loads of gratuitous sex, nudity, and titillation, but with very little real substance. If you want a cleaner alternative, check out [[ASIN:B001662FIW Flawless]]. If you want a more traditional, more action packed heist movie, watch [[ASIN:B000X6ZFKG The Italian Job]]. If you want something in the middle, there is always [[ASIN:6305657947 The Thomas Crown Affair]].
0312370849|5.0|I always enjoy historically based fiction.  This is one of the best novels I have read that's based during WWII and the Holocaust.  I had no idea about that Jews were rounded up like this in Paris.     The book is well written and takes the reader back and forth between the present day and the events of 1942.  The story is really brought to life and you will find yourself drawn into them and at times just heart broken.  This isn't a light read but is wonderfully written and you will remember it.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I am very pleased with David Cook.  This is a solid album, but frankly, he could sing \\"Hot Cross Buns\\" and make it sound edgy and passionate. I have waited eagerly for this CD for six months, and it was not in vain.    I rated it with four stars only to allow a little wiggle room for his future live album, which will be even better. Thanks, Dave! You made me very happy.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This may be the greatest heavy metal album of the 1970s, and simultaneously one of the greatest progressive rock albums of all time.  The songwriting, vocals, and all around musicianship are on the level of the very best of Floyd or Yes, as well as Led Zeppelin or Deep Purple.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest guitar albums of the decade, and the same could be said for the drumming, too.  Ritchie Blackmore contributes the finest compositions of his distinguished career as a hard rock/heavy metal composer.  His guitar playing on this album influenced everyone from Kirk Hammett to Randy Rhoads to Yngwie Malmsteen.  The man is a master.  Cozy Powell gave one of the supreme metal drumming performances here--his work ranks with the best of Bonham, Binks, Ward, McBrain, Dave Holland, Phil Taylor, and the other luminaries of classic metal.  This was the last album Cozy recorded with Ludwig drums before switching to his beloved Yamaha Drums the next year.  He played Yamaha exclusively for the rest of his distinguished career until his death in 1998.<br /><br />What can one say about Ronnie James Dio?  He is more than just a great vocalist (Halford is his only true rival in metal, followed by Dickinson); he is also one of the finest melodists in metal, and his melodic sense has been evident in all his work until at least the mid-1980s.  He does the finest songwriting of his career here with Blackmore (he also did exceptional writing later with Tony Iommi, but his chemistry with Ritchie is unsurpassed).  His vocals are powerful and genre-defining.<br /><br />Listen to \\"Stargazer\\" to hear the greatest hard rock/heavy metal epic of all time, easily surpassing even \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"  Listen to \\"A Light in the Dark\\" to hear where speed metal came from.  Finally, don't forget the truly extraordinary work by keyboardist Tony Carey.  This is how hard rock keyboards should be.  Carey is an amazing arranger and his playing is elegant and virtuosic.  This album alone makes himworthy of mention with other greats like Wakeman.  Every rock keyboardist should study his amazing work here.<br /><br />Finally, Jimmy Bain simply rocks as a bassist.  His lines are powerful and melodic.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this album.  I'm glad to see it get so many rave reviews here.  It deserves it like few other albums do.  Rainbow will always be a cult band of sorts, but for true metal lovers they hold a special place as one of the greatest bands of their time.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|People may say I'm crazy, but I think this cd is tied, if not slightly better, than the Black Album.  As far as I'm concerned, the Black Album was their downfall.  Don't get me wrong....I still love the Black Album.  At least these songs are something I can look forward to watching them play live.  I can't say the same for Load, Reload & St. Anger (which was just a shame).  Death Magnetic is their best release in years.  Lets be honest with ourselves.....we won't see anything like the Master of Puppets era ever again, but this is the best that we can hope for.  My favorite song on here is \\"All Nightmare Long.\\"  They threw in a few good, \\"old school\\" thrash riffs that are half-decent.  I definately recommend this album with an open listening heart.  I loved it at first listen, but some of my friends took a while to get into it.  Give it a few tries and it grows on you.  METAL UP YOUR....!!!
B001F7XIJW|5.0|If you can actually sit and listen to this incredible album from start to finish, you will need to either: a) listen to it again, or b) just go to bed!  It's some of the best metal out there and actually quite serious.  Gojira, forgetting for a moment the incredibly stupid band name, have a message to tell, and, despite my general lack of interest in entertainers delivering a \\"message\\" (be it politics, state of the world, etc.), I can't help but be interested in what they have to say.  Much like their last great album \\"From Mars to Sirius,\\" which dealt with the fact that humanity is killing the planet, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" is more epic in scope.  From what I can tell, kind of deals with nothing less than life and death, etc.  Anyway, the music is delivered here with a deft hand and utter technical mastery. You won't find a better metal/concept album this year.  Maybe Mastodon's new one will top it next year, but for now, and especially if you haven't heard Gojira yet, give it a spin...you won't be disappointed.

0316066524|3.0|Of course this is an excellent book for anyone familiar with David Foster Wallace...my only gripe is that (like many other times) book arrived in the mail looking like it had been kicked around and stomped on before it got to my door. Book appears to be in far-from-new condition. This is a battle I have fought with Amazon many times (although I rolled the dice and ordered Genesis 1970-1975 and had to admit it was in excellent and new condition but only after I had sent an e-mail after ordering it to be sure it arrived in new and not beat-up condition).

Based on the comments here, it looks like I will NOT be disappointed.  I was lead to this book by my friend Ami, who says (and I quote):\\"This book changed how I interact with EVERYONE. It changed who I am and how I see everyone in my life and it helped me to understand why some relationships don't work, and some do. You'll love it!\\"    With this kind of testimonial, how could I NOT give it a try?!?!?!  I have just ordered the book, so I will be back AFTER this exciting read.  I can't wait!!!

B001ED7C58|3.0|You know, I listen to a lot of music being an artist myself, and was really looking forward to hearing the soundtrack to this movie.  I was really left hanging, a tad bit disappointed and at lost for words.  Most of the songs on the cd are boring, not even touching the depth of the books or the movie for that matter.  I don't know who was awarded the right to pick the songs, but they suck.  I only gave 3 points for this soundtrack because at least 3 songs managed to \\"touch\\" the storyline.  The Black Ghosts' Full Moon with it's gothic broody tune probably is the best song here.  It's the only one that has any similarity to the story.  Linkin Park's \\"Leave Out the Rest\\" is okay.  It falls short, and leaves you sort of hanging at the end.  The words are decent, but no great lyric writing here.  The only other song, Rob Pattinson's Never Think, has decent lyrics, and it is underproduced, leaving an almost bare sound, but that is okay.  Hopefully for the next soundtrack they will look around a little better.  Mira has the almost perfect songs on both her cds \\"Projekt\\" and \\"Apart\\".  Songs like \\"Plastique\\", \\"Cayman\\" or even \\"Hollow\\" would have been much more appropriate for this soundtrack.  Autumn's Grey Solace, Ivy, and even some of Sarah Brightman's songs would have been much deeper and more meaningful if they had been included.  Hopefully, we will get a better selection next time.  For now, just wait for the musical score to come out and save yourself a few dollars.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|Again only 5 channel audio for such a huge release.  The studios are really getting lazy and putting out trash.  For this reason alone I cannot take Blu-ray seriously.  Until we start really utilizing the technology this format is a lost.  I'd expect at least a DTS ES 6 channels or ideally full 7 channel HD audio.  For this reason I would suggest people boycott buying these HD formats simply because the studios and Sony are ripping people off.
B00004X10B|5.0|Great bag very nice layout I use it with two Nikon bodies five lens and two large flashes and then a ton of other stuff in the many compartments.  Bag seals up very well and the strap is of a great design too.  All together i think anyone that has more than one camera body should have this bag.
0783240287|5.0|I saw the musical on Broadway several years ago, and I have to say that the film does an excellent job of capturing the engery of a live performance.  The cast is superb, the music is still fresh, the jokes are still funny, and the layers of reality are done exttremely well.  I recently viewed this and Joseph: King of Dreams back-to-back, and there is no doubt that this is the far better retelling of the story.    This mucical is appropriate for even small children, but it is not a children's show.   I would recommend this to just about everyone.
1577314808|2.0|I do believe people can benefit from focusing on the present moment more, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.  Duh.  Did it need to be repeated ad nauseum for however many pages though?      Also, what's up with this dude just \\"declaring\\" that he's all enlightened?  Says who??  Him??  Well gee, how convenient!  And  he just HAPPENS to want your money, too - what a coincidence!  Don't you think if someone really was in such a state of peace and joy and love all the time, he would be doing this for free?  OK, if focusing on the present moment works for him and he wants to write a book about it, cool -  I respect that.  But he makes a lot of declarations without telling us how he supposedly knows these things.  He seems to be banking on the fact that people are just going to believe everything he says w/ out thinking critically about it.  Unfortunately he seems to be right.    He says \\"humanity is evolving\\", and this can be achieved only thru focusing on the present moment.  I'm not saying this is false, it COULD be true, but how does HE know that?  Did God tell him?  Is he psychic?  Does he \\"just know\\"?  Well I could claim to \\"just know\\" something too, and write a book about it, would everyone just believe me too?  Who the hell is this guy, anyway?  He doesn't appear to have any qualifications.  All I can gather is that he had a \\"spiritual awakening\\" in which he sat on a park bench for 2 years in a state of utter bliss and peace.  Ummm, did it ever occur to anyone he could be mentally ill?  I'm just saying that maybe we shouldn't accept everything this man says just because he says it.      Also, I have yet to hear an explanation for how he was able to sit on that bench for 2 yr and still survive - did he live in a cardboard box?  It sounds like he wasn't working.  Was he independently wealthy?  Oh, that's another thing, if he was that enlightened, why would he just sit there contributing nothing to society for that long?  I would think he would be either out doing something to help others, like Mother Teresa or Gandhi or somebody, or teaching people, like Jesus or the Buddha.  How is sitting on a park bench helping anything?  I'm just saying it sounds kinda suspicious.      I think if a REAL spiritual leader ever comes along again, we will know it, b/c they will want NOTHING from us.  Not 1 single penny.  Why would they?  Not saying this dude is ill-intentioned; maybe he means well.  But until someone comes along w/ a message about spirituality who does NOT want my money, I take everything these people say w/ a grain of salt.      OK, other issues: 1) He claims that if we are in the \\"now\\", we will not harm our environment.  Well how do you figure?  If we're only thinking about right now, then why would anyone recycle, conserve natural resources, etc.?  It seems to me that the only reason people do these things is because they're concerned about the FUTURE of this planet, and the planet we will leave for our children.  2) I have a problem w/ his section on menstruation.  I am a woman.  As a man, I don't think Tolle really has any right to speak on this subject.  Again, how does HE know all this?  He just speaks on it as if he's the voice of authority we should all just believe w/ out questioning anything.  But where did he come up with his \\"theory\\"?  Tell me where you're getting your information from first, then I will decide whether or not I believe you.  3) He warns us not to get \\"caught up\\" in our emotions. I've done and tried this many times, it only makes things worse - the emotions are still there.  If you don't allow yourself to feel them, you're asking for problems. Speaking for myself, whenever I've tried to not feel what I'm feeling such as by focusing on \\"the present\\" and deluding myself into thinking I really have no problems, I either am literally unable to keep it up, or if I can, then the feelings pop up later, often in the form of nightmares.   I don't appreciate people telling me how Ishould feel.  If God didn't want us to ever feel angry, sad, unhappy, scared, etc., he would not have given us these emotions.      Last but not least, if you're a fan of Oprah, remember that a) she promoted The Secret.  BTW, if you want a really good laugh, pick up The Secret (don't buy it though, just flip through it in a bookstore or something).  b) she's responsible for Dr. Phil and c) in her magazine, she advertises things like skirts for $3,000, or a coat for your DOG for $1,900!  Meanwhile people are starving in the streets.  I don't think she's a bad person, but she's detached from reality b/c of too much money and fame.  I don't think we can put good faith into things she recommends.
B001GQACGE|3.0|I have the upmost respect for Beyonce as I have followed her since the 1st Destiny Child's album. When Beyonce entered her solo career, it was suprising and scary however, I lOVE her 1st and 2nd albums!!!    Now on to the release of the 3rd album: My honest opinion surfaces around 2 things: love for music and the artist's history. Beyonce has been around for 13 years so I can relate to her style and she has matured and grown tremendously. When I first bought the new album, I was asking who is Shasha Fierce. Okay, an alter ego.......wow is all I can say.     She was smart to split the love ballad/slow songs from the up tempo songs but she could have comprised that on 1 cd. Especially since I hate playing a CD with 5 or only 6 songs on it it. The First CD presents a mixture of emotions: disappointment, shocked, and definitely could tell that Beyonce knows how to switch her style to appear as though she is part of any culture or race. I like Tracks #1,2, and 4. The other tracks represent country and contemporary urban.     DISC 2: I can honestly say that Tracks 1, 3, and 5 is to let black people know that Beyonce knows her roots. She represents different people on each track, so I see where that alter ego fits in. Wow. I couldn't get into Track #2 and I love Track #4 Sweet Dreams.    I gave her 3 stars based on creativity, diversity, and sex appeal. She would have scored higher if she could have found a way to blend all the songs on 1 cd. Also, she could have scored higher if she tried to stick to being her own individual instead of representing multiple people. All I can say is don't let marriage change you and hopefully if there is another album, refer back to this one for improvement.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I found this great.  It exposed me to bands I had not listened to before, which I always enjoy.  It is one of the first things my children request when we get in the car.
0375826726|5.0|Just as with the first two installments, Brisingr is an enjoyable read.  The story is compelling and the level of detail is impressive. My only criticism is that Paolini (on a few occassions) focuses a bit too much on meaningless details when he should be pushing the plot. Other than that, Brisingr is a very satisfying read and I can't wait for the fourth and final book.     As for the negative comments, everyone is obviously entitled to their opinion, but it will be interesting to see how many of those who left less than positive feedback still read the fourth book.  I have a feeling that (just like those who left negative reviews for books 1 and 2) they will be back again with more comments the next round --which is telling.  Why do some people continue to read these books if they don't like them?
0596007124|5.0|This is awesome! All developers MUST have this book. You can apply to not only Java but other programming language, Ruby, PHP, C# etc. But you have to have basic knowledge of Java to read this book though. Anyway, you should get it one now.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I love these movies first off or atleast one and two.  I have the DVD box and now the Blu-ray.  I can definetly tell a difference.  Is it worth buying again?  That is debatable but since I love these movies and bought them with a gift certificate and there is a rebate, I am completely satisfied.<br /><br />If you don't own these movies yet, get the Blu-ray ASAP.  If you do own these on DVD then you may want to wait and see if the price comes down or ask for it as a holiday gift.
0446402389|5.0|I keep waiting for the world to wake up and figure out that this deserves to be a Top 10 best seller. I can't imagine a more engrossing debut novel.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Well I thought I would repeat what others have said in case someone is still having doubts about it. If you are a fan of the Matrix there's no reason not to buy this one.    Video - 4.9/5 The quality is just great, and it looks impressive and far superior to any other format, period. The only reason I'm not giving it 5/5 is because there are some points where you can notice some insignificant details due to the source material, not the transfer itself.    Audio - 5/5 True HD audio is beyond amazing, if you had this on DVD you'll be blown away even if you are listening to it using headphones. And if you have a decent sound system you'll simply toss your DVDs to the recycle bin and never look back faster than you can say \\"I know Kung Fu\\".    Aditional Features - 4.5/5 Many people don't like digital copy only for the first movie, and while they have a point you wont really notice the loss once you watch the Blu-ray movies. Besides, that's just icing to the cake, so you'll probably be better off with a portable DVD player/laptop (and your old movies if you didn't toss them to the trash by then)for those cases anyway.    And the rest of the features is very complete with the only \\"complain\\" being about the 480p DVD format content. Which anyone who has watched it will probably agree that isn't even a loss considering you'll only watch them once or twice (specially compared to the 100 times you'll watch the BD movies.)    Long story short it's worth it, big time. Just make sure you have a display that makes these movies justice and at least a decent sound system.     You'll thank yourself. d(^^d)
0071410945|2.0|There are common themes among idea producing books that cover all aspects of developing the necessary state of mind to produce valuable ideas.  Young covers the basics in this book but offers little else.  At best this book represents an outline of the common themes, and at worst is it a 20 page book stretched into 47 pages (very large font, small book, less than 20 lines per page - likely 15-20 pages for standard sizes).<br /><br />I rate this book as a two instead of a one as it does momentarily capture the essence of idea production in the following statements:<br /><br />\\"An idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements.\\"<br /><br />\\"The capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on the ability to see relationships.\\"<br /><br />\\"The habit of the mind which leads to a search for relationships between facts becomes the highest importance of the production of ideas.\\"<br /><br />Beyond these quotes the book encompasses little else other than a three page chapter about taking action.  I sincerely believe that if you understand the above quotations as well as the notion that once you have the idea, you have to actually use the idea for it to have value, then you already know everything this book has to offer.<br /><br />I highly recommend much better material on the subject found in \\"How to Get Ideas\\" by Jack Foster; a book that will not disappoint you as it is laced with real world examples, applications, and exercises to produce countless ideas.
B000AM6OKS|5.0|The band were on a roll at this time coming out with two great albums near the end of the 60s Beggars Banquet and Let It Bleed, unfortunatly then the band had too face the horrific events that happened that signaled the end of the 60s, altamont. But than the band came back in 1971 with Sticky Fingers an album containing rockers like, Brown Sugar, Bitch, Cant You Hear Me Knocking, and more. Classic album and was one of there last really great albums they came out with.
0385504209|5.0|Ignore the religious truth or whatever. This is a fantastic thriller with great writing. Angels and Demons is slightly better in my opinion, but this book is on the top of my list as must reads. Absolutely fantastic writing.

B0014DZ2VO|3.0|Now the green corporation is a front for the evil<br />international conspiracy. Bond is saving the world from eco-terrorists<br />in this new versions of a super-bad super agent.<br />He does roof flying oriental style without kung fu.<br />Some how he manages to chase and bed his way to new highs or maybe lows?<br />Not as many high tech gadgets, but several new bond girls<br />get the British best. Since Britain is Green central, I doubt they will be happy with the Prince's hobby horse being called subversive?<br />Hollywood has probably sold out on this one?
B001ED7C58|3.0|I don't claim to be a pro-music critic, but I just wanted to put my two cents in since everyone else is!    I listened to the previews before watching the movie and thought it seemed way out of whack with the mood of the story...but after watching the movie, I could see that it does goes along.  The movie was pretty teen angsty, which is why this soundtrack fits.  The upside was that the song \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" was extremely catchy and made me finally check out Muse...they're completely awesome.  Really.  Also, I loved that this song was chosen for the baseball game scene, which was my favorite part of the movie...  And I already loved Iron and Wine, and the song that's on the album is blissfully dreamy.      After a while and much debate, I just got sucked into the whole Twilight obsession and just bought the darn album.  Just give in.  It's not worth fighting.  :)  It's fun to listen to any day.  And if you're more into the instrumental, you should check out the movie's score soundtrack which was composed by the ever-dramatic, moody specialist, Carter Burwell--which was a pleasant surprise!  I haven't heard his stuff in the longest, and I used to be obsessed with his music from Gods and Monsters.  (off tangent, but yeah...)    So that's my take!
B000002OCP|5.0|After first listening to this album I thought I had made a mistake. I knew going in that this was not a traditional Muddy Waters album. I had been used to \\"Fathers & Sons,\\" which is an AMAZING album. At first listen I thought that Electric Mud sounded like a jumbled mess that with two musical styles that didn't mesh so well. After a few listens this album gre on me big time!. Electric Mud will be added to the other classics in my collection and will be listened to for many years to come. My advice, keep an open mind and give it a try!
B001GV09FS|2.0|If you're buying this because \\"Chiquitita\\" (which should have been on the original release) is listed as being on the CD in this new version, save your money because it is NOT. One of the main reasons I bought this was so that I could finally have that song.<br /><br />The other reason I wanted this was for the DVD since the description gave me the impression that there would be a good \\"behind the scenes\\" look at the recording session for the CD. The \\"Behind the Music\\" featurette is 12 minutes 39 seconds long. There's a great deal of footage from various stage productions around the world, old footage of ABBA, clips from the movie but VERY LITTLE footage of the recording of the CD. For what it's worth, I haven't actually watched the featurette yet, I've just fast forwarded through it to get an idea of what's in it so I can write this review, but from what I've seen, it's not at all what I was expecting.<br /><br />You'll be hard-pressed to find a bigger fan of this movie and soundtrack than me. I've seen the movie more times than I should probably admit and the CD hasn't left the CD player in my car since it came out. The second I found out about this \\"deluxe edition\\" of the soundtrack, I pre-ordered it. I can honestly say that I wish I had saved my money. There's no difference in the CD's themselves, all you're paying for is the new packaging, a 12 minute featurette that very easily could have (and probably should have) been included on the DVD release of the movie, and the video for \\"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme\\" which is included on the two-DVD special edition of the movie. If you don't already own the soundtrack then yes, this is worth buying but if you do already have the original release from July then this one really isn't worth it.
B0019CSXAM|4.0|How I Met Your Mother season 3 starts off a little slow, but really picks up quick.  Season 3 puts HIMYM in the upper echelon of comedy shows on tv right now because it is maintaining a high level of excellence without faltering like other popular shows such as the Office.
0439023483|5.0|It's not often you find a book that doesn't have a single wrong note to it, but this is one. This book really has it all, from suspense to a little bit of political philosophy to unrequited love. Collins takes all the elements of this story and puts them together in a tightly-woven narrative that keeps its pace throughout. Her message, about government and the masses, is not very subtle, but the book is so well written that it goes down very smoothly. I could gush on and on, but I won't. I will say that I'm very skeptical about the proposed sequel(s), because they couldn't possibly be as good as this one!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|If you are sick of sanitised period peices then this is a fine example. The lighting is has a very natural quality, there's dirt and it is an honest attempt at Jane Austens book. Well done.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I think my favorite song is \\"Life on the Moon\\" (I have this one on repeat so much I'm afraid my neighbors are going to start complaining) but \\"Avalanche\\" with the glorious high notes and touching words, and \\"Declaration\\" an upbeat rocker and \\"Light On\\" also an upbeat song, with the distinct Cornell flair, are all close seconds. Then of course there is \\"Barbasol\\" which is crazy good. Can't forget \\"Kiss on the Neck\\" which reminds me of good old Elton John's earlier music only upgraded with a more relevant sound. \\"Permanent\\" is a masterpiece, but you better be somewhere you can bawl your eyes out, because this one is a heart wrenching tear jerker, people! I totally expect men to cry when they listen to this one. And \\"ADAM\\" (A Daily Anthem) is unbelievably beautiful. \\"Time of My Life\\" just made platinum, and it is a great song. Just wait until you hear these other songs on your radio. Can't get enough! I play my music loudly, and my cat leaves the room when I join in, because my high notes don't sound as good as David's!!! I heard someone compared David to Rob Thomas. Forget Rob Thomas, I loved his earlier work, but this guy will be bigger than the Beatles.
1594201927|5.0|Only the educated are free -- Epictetus<br /><br />I think if your interested in how the world has worked, does work, and will work, you would benefit from reading this book.  Ferguson has taken advantage some of his excellent previous work (e.g., The House of Rothschild, The Cash Nexus, Colossus, Empire) and created a well written account of the history of \\"money\\" - in all of its forms, from ancient times to May 2008 (hardback version).<br /><br />I particularly like his dividing up of the subject in logical chapters: Chapter one is all about \\"cash\\"; Chapter two is \\"bonds\\"; Chapter three is \\"stocks\\"; Chapter four is \\"insurance\\"; Chapter five is \\"property\\"; Chapter six is about \\"currency\\" and (globalization and deglobalization).  The last chapter is more about human and societal nature.  The last chapter is insightful and informative, as is all his chapters.<br /><br />So obviously I recommend the book, but since I doubt I can contact Dr. Ferguson personally, I will take this forum to quibble about some fine points that he does not realize he is unaware of.  Namely his good and insightful analogy between biological evolution (Darwinian) and human societies. Yes, they are related. Actually, there is more here than meets the eye.  Ferguson acknowledges that societal evolution is similar but not the same as Darwinian eucaryotic evolution.  His comparison is pretty good.  But there is Lynn Margulis' work at the procaryotic world (e.g., Mergers & Acquistions in societal terms) that one can use to understand a broader view of biological evolution, which has relevance to the standard neo-Darwinian dogma of Dawkins and Gould AND societal evolution at the corporate level (and the web) that Dr. Ferguson outlines so well in his book.<br /><br />Otherwise it is a great read.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|This CD is fantastic.  Out of the whole CD, there is only one song that I don't like.  I haven't taken it out of my CD player in weeks.

B000EHSVOG|5.0|Irwin Allen's follow-up to \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" was a star studded spectacle with wonderful special effects and lots of suspense.  Starring Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Faye Dunaway and William Holden.  Music by John Williams.  Look for Maureen McGovern singing \\"We May Never Love Like This Again\\".
B000002J09|5.0|purchased this in vinyl format when at first release.  Saw the show at Madision Sq Garden both nights, \\"Song Remains the Same\\".  If you love Led Zepplin then the remastered version is one for your collection.  I'm glad Jimmy Page gave his blessing on the remix.  Well done all around.....

031606792X|5.0|Stephenie Meyer gives her fans everything they want and everything they need in this book to give a fufilling and riveting finale to their story.  I stayed away from spoilers before I read BD and I was so stunned and excited as I read this book.  The story of Edward and Bella comes full circle, and their love is the paramount theme.  I would caution moms about letting young girls read this-- the material is mature.  That being said, older readers will find themselves lost in Bella's new and wonderful world.

B001GQACGO|2.0|I usually listen to a new album at least 3 times so that I know for sure whether I like it or not and I can give an honest opinion on it. That's exactly what I did with this album.  I was only impressed with 3 songs which are Halo, Disappear, and Sweet Dreams. The rest of the songs on the Beyonce side didn't hold my attention. The Sasha Fierce side was dull to me as well. It's like she took a step backwards. Songs like Radio, If I Were A Boy, and Video Phone sound adolescent and doesn't even sound like something she should sing at this point in her career.  I guess I was expecting a lot more of a mature sound from her since she said she has been working on it for over a year and she recorded over 70 songs. I was expecting to hear some standout production that would be timeless and that I could keep on repeat and groove into, but that wasn't the case for me.  I recommend that people preview the whole album on You Tube first. All of the tracks are on there by now. If you only like some of songs like me, just purchase the singles you like.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|I've loved this band since the early 1990s, and to have a DVD with virtually all the videos to their greatest songs on it is a must have for my collection. I'd have to say that my two fav videos are November Rain and Don't Cry. Axl has a unique and unmistakeable voice while Slash would have to be rated up there as one of the greatest lead guitarists of all time.    Long live Guns n' Roses!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|WOW! What an Entertainting and Visual Feast EXperience this is for the Human Eyes and what a Magical Concert Experience this must have been for those Fans Live in London.

ONe of Very Few Artists that Knows how to Put ON a Damn Good Show and Have a Blast while doing it. I will sum UP this Review by saying that ...that was NO 50 Year old Preforming Women UP on that Stage..that was A STAR...and a STAR She WAS!!@! ps..Live CD portion that comes with this package Reeks..bla

0670020745|5.0|I purchased the book \\"Stroke of Insight\\" for my friend and my granddaughter as gifts.  I saw the author interviewed on Oprah and thought it would be a wonderful gift for my friend because she had almost died from a stroke and would like a better understanding of what had occurred. My granddaughter is studying to be an RN and I felt it may help her with patient care.
B001GKYBXA|2.0|I don't like this album!    Where's the fantastic paul McCartney that crafted fantastic songs that made you snap your fingers and tap your toes?  The brilliant pop and rock master that could write a hit song at the drop of a hat.    Some reviews here have made some negative remarks about McCartney's Wings and solo albums, well I'll take any of them over this disjointed, unstructured, out of place noise!    This album doesn't even come close to being one of McCartney's best!  The only good song is Highway, and I do think McCartney should perform it live on his next tour, Dance Til We're High is decent, those two songs are the reason I gave this album two stars, but other than that, forget about it!    I'm amazed that some bash his Wings and solo albums, but here he throws together a bunch of weird fragments in one day that sound like something for belly dancers and some people are falling all over themselves over it!    Some people don't want well crafted songs, they rather hear some weird, out of left field, experimental whatever?      To each his own, but give me the masterfully crafted rock and pop of Wings and albums like Memory Almost Full, now that's McCartney at his very best!    Electric Arguments is just a bunch of weird sounding thrown together noise!!  Just like McCartney II and the other Fireman albums this is one of McCartney's absolute worst!!
B00005JPS8|4.0|Now here is a \\"comic\\" book movie. They didn't mess too much with the costume, it didn't take itself waaaay too serious and it stayed fairly faithful to the source material. Plus we got that real cool set up for the Avengers. When I saw the movie in the theatre all the fanboys went nuts for that little bit at the end of the credits, and I was impressed too. I wish I had thought of it. Downey Jr. is great as Stark (unlike Christian Bale with that silly diguised voice.) It shows that you can stay pretty faithful to the source material and still make a good film. It pleased the fans AND the general audience, AND it really was Iron man. Not a guy in an armored batsuit who usually has the intellect of Sherlock Holmes but (in this movie version) gets others to do his thinking for him. Oh right.... that was another summer film. Iron man was the film of the summer as far as I am concerned.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|This is horror with the required blood and violence, but with out the all out wanton violence in such movies as Kill Bill or Saw.    The extras are cool too! Behind the scenes home movie footage.
B001ED7C58|4.0|The majority of the songs on this CD are really good.  My favorite is the Black Ghosts song.  I have listened to the CD many times now and I think it's a great soundtrack.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|I love this cd and am thrilled that he took things in this direction. Once Again was good but in my opinion too slow. Get Lifted is a classic and Evolver has the energy of Get Lifted with and evolving sound. Nice soul throughout with tastes of hip hop and reggae. Very listenable. Favorite tracks: Green Light, Quickly, No Other Love & Satisfaction.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|I watched this a few years back, and I still remember all of it. The revenge plot may be simple, but it starts to become much more when the movie progresses, and the ending is purely disturbing at many levels. I'm not going to give much on the plot, but I will say that this movie is not for the sqeamish. There's lots of gore, sexual content, and (arguably) surrealism. This isn't one of my favorites, but I did get alot from it.<br /><br />A-
0670020745|5.0|I too am a stroke survior.  This book is both liberating and difficult for me to read.  I have tried to describe to family what I experienced but could not articulate the way the author does.  It is difficult to read as it brings up so many issues for me too.  The loss of self and my previous life is the worst.   I did think it gave my husband a greater understanding of the day to day struggles -even though everyone thinks I have 'recovered'.   If you have a loved one that has had a stroke, please read this book.
B00005JN0T|2.0|I have the movie in full screen. I wanted a wide screen version to play on my computer lcd monitor.    Oops!! it quit playing about halfway through.  Tested on a stand alone DVD player same thing.    Dispointed...
1577314808|5.0|[[ASIN:1577314808 The Guide to Enlightenment]]The Power of Now:spiritual  If you have not heard of Ekhart Tolle's The Power of Now by now, you must have been living in a cave.  The Power of Now which was promoted by Oprah has \\"it\\" all.  Living in the present is where our \\"power\\" is to experience our lives in the ultimate fullness we were intended and designed to do and isn't that what we all want to be capable of achieving.  The Power of Now reveals how to accomplish this goal presenting all the pitfalls that delude us into past or future thoughtforms. how to revise and change those thoughtforms. What many may think of as \\"power\\" is not power over others however the power of ourselves to experience our lives owning our own power which is the way of not only living our lives being self empowered and experiencing the divinity and peace that lies within all of us.
0307276902|5.0|By far an excellent book, and easy to read. Very enlighting to a subject most parents fear. Highly recommended!!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is an excellent CD and would be great for the family.  Chosen music gives clear picture of the show.
1565847032|5.0|\\"Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky\\" is the best book I have read of his after completing \\"Profit Over People\\" and \\"Failed States\\". The short monologues make this book most accessible, and the large amount of topics make it incredibly interesting and engaging. The style of the narrative is echoed and cushioned often with sentences beginning with words like \\"So\\", \\"Look\\" or \\"See\\". His dissident voice rarely gets old and sometimes reverberates (you hear a lot about latin america and Nicaragua specifically.) When speaking of democracy, he is relentless as usual, attacking America's current doctrines, particularly our free market capital system, discussing all the special interest that grows with it (government working with corporations and vice versa.) When discussing struggle or even activism, he breathes relief and some hope about America. It's a little absurd and incorrect to say Chomsky's views are \\"anti american\\", perhaps it is \\"anti institutional\\", in the sense he is nothing more than a free thinker who doesn't mold into our mostly ill-formed institutions. It's really a relief to find someone who stands outside these models and paradigms, even so he is spatted on and ridiculed for his huge, grand dissident voice. Reading Chomsky is a celebration of what the intellectual mind can manipulate and deliver to those who are willing to hear it.
B000065K8F|5.0|So many people are surprised by this movie.  The fact that David Lynch could make a simple, straightforward, sweet story has left many surprised and dumbfounded.  Have all of you forgotten about ELEPHANT MAN??? He portrayed John Merrick with a sweet and sensitive disposition. In the end David served up one of the most sad but poignant endings more so than the straight story. I'm only surprised that he never made more of this style.  He is equally adept at this style as he is to his bizarre plot provoking mind twisted movies.     If you have the slightest hint of impatience then this movie then this is not for you.  If not then you in for a gem. Richard Farnsworth performance as Alvin Straight is nothing short of brilliant. It's a sad shame too many people missed it.    This movie is a beautiful portrait of simple america portraying it's ideals, folkways and convictions. Something we should be reminded of more often.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I also hope this movie doesn't leave out so many of the exciting events from the book.    I feel sorry for people who don't understand what fantasy fiction is - it's not real and it doesn't cause people to become oppressed by demons.  I wonder if \\"Sam\\" has even read a Harry Potter book. Probably too afraid.  If you read these books you see themes of friendship, loyalty, honesty, compassion for others, persisting against obstacles, standing up for what is right & good, fighting evil, sacrificing self for others, so many admirable themes I can't even list them all.  It's sad that some people only judge a book \\"by the cover\\". I am a Christian my entire life and I don't believe these books corrupt anyone.  You are corrupted by what is inside you, Sam, in your heart.
B001IQMCZQ|3.0|I was so excited to hear Jennifer's new album but was quite disappointed when I did hear it. Too many producers on it so there are too many different sounding songs. I am not saying an artist shouldn't have different sounding songs but each producer has their own influence on a song. It should have been a couple of producers for this album helping it to have a more consistant feeling to it yet letting the listener feel it all didn't sount alike. I really only like the first 5 songs then it gets uninteresting. If Jenifer didn't have a huge amount of artistic input on this album, hopefully next time she will. Best wishes to Jennifer and her family as they pull together to give each other strength in their time of need!
0316017922|5.0|In OUTLIERS, Gladwell has produced a thought-provoking book that not only aims to describe a phenomenon but urges new thinking based on the conclusions that he outlines. If you are a school teacher, you might not like the idea of a year-around school but you will have difficulty arguing with the logic that the author puts forth. If you are a person who believes that people are always raising themselves up by their own bootstraps in the struggle for success, you are going to have your thinking challenged. At the same time, if you have ever wondered about the formula for success you will find some research that will provide the different factors that you have to account for if you are striving for success. As with Gladwell's TIPPING POINT and his subsequent BLINK, you are going to find some of your long-held beliefs at least put up for questioning?     So, what do Candadian hockey players and computer moguls have in common? What does growing rice have to do with success in school and why might 10,000 be the lucky number? Those questions all have answers in this book, which is engaging, challenging and more personal than you are used to reading from Malcolm Gladwell.
0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins explains his views in a very intelligent and thought provoking manner.  He bravely delves into the myths of religion and why they are fiction and not facts.  He explains that science is always asking questions, people who promote one religion or another ask us to just believe and not ask questions.    I recommend this well-written book to everyone who has an inquiring mind, especially regarding science and religion.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South was a class production from beginning to end.  The actors (most of whom I did not know) were excellent and well-cast, especially Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack.  The story was engaging, educational, and well-developed.  The scenery and props were wonderful!  I rate it a 10 out of 10.
0307346617|4.0|Book got here in good time. It was a great book. Loved the realism behind the fantasy type story.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|After listening to this CD a few times, I realized that the filler had to go.  I made a mix of the odd-numbered tunes: 1,3,5,7,9,11.  Beautiful, lovely, varied, her talent, depth and celtic touch really shows through.  I don't know what is the story with the other tunes but they are just too monotonous, slow-moving, non-melodic for me.  Maybe over time I will seek them out. But I fully enjoy the ones I am listening to now.  Dido's great, deep, no one else out there compares.
1416594884|5.0|Anyone who likes John LeCarre's books will also like this one. Reminded me a little of the \\"Little Drummer Girl\\", but was not so elaborate and refined in the description of the protagonists. Enjoyed reading it and would definitly recommend it. Make probably a good gift too for Le Carre beginners.
B000Q66PXE|4.0|The BBC has a justified worldwide reputation for producing top-draw dramas, and HBO has a reputation for producing hardcore dramas such as The Sopranos.  Although I was a bit skeptical about this tie-up, it worked pretty well in Rome. I ordered both Season 1 and Season 2 from Amazon, and loved every minute of both of them.   It's a crying shame that there will be no Season 3, because the viewer numbers were not good enough. Everyone wants reality tv these days, it seems....humph!  My only real criticism of the shows, and it's more a question-mark than a criticism, is how did on earth did they get so many cockney accents in Rome at the turn of the millenium? Not only accents, but the slang used was very London Docks.   I have read other criticisms that have pointed out that none of the major battle scenes were enacted, and although it wouldn't have been a bad thing to have included these, I think the show was more about the people than the historical battles that took place.   Fantastic shows, well done the Beeb and HBO.
0783227434|5.0|The third movie of the Evil Dead trilogy and the best of the three. Enjoyable for the uninitiated and loyal Deadites as well.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This is a great collection of the GILMORE GIRL tv series. It is so fun to watch. If you love the show, you will love this collection of the entire series!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|So the Holiday is a typical romantic comedy and the outcome is predictable but it is fun to watch and will keep your girlfriend snuggled up close. There are some claissic moments that everyone should enjoy. For the price on Amazon it's certainly worth owning.
B000687M48|5.0|I only have one word for this album and group--FANTASTIC!  Oh, and Amy Lee is gorgeous!!
B000H1QYXY|5.0|Had the dvd went missing, replaced it with cd excellent 10/10 quality everything.Well recommended Marty
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I watched this movie three times the first day I got it.  It's not perfect, but it's pretty dang funny.  There aren't any parts that are really slow or fail to evoke emotion.  The voice actors rock.  There is actual meat to each character.  None are forgettable.  If you watch this movie, you will have fun--every time.
B001DCQIAU|5.0|Let it be known!...This box set will soon be discontinued by DG.  It is \\"limited edition\\", which means that they will only produce so many copies.  (DG already stopped producing the Oliver Messiaen 32 CD Complete Edition box I found out from my local classical distributor, which only came out last week!)<br /><br />This Karajan edition really stunts all of the other recent Karajan editions that have been coming out.  Everyone knows that these are his greatest recordings from his golden years of the 70's, not to mention the sound engineering on them were Karajan's best from his entire discography in terms of quality, depth and range...so I will save my praises on each of the cycles, since they've been sung endlessly already!<br /><br />I will just note that this is a small hardcover box with slip sleeves.  The booklet only has the cd listings and track timings...NO LINER NOTES WHATSOEVER.<br /><br />But with the the price of the box not even a hundred dollars...and with each of the seperate cycles going for roughly $50 to $100 anyway...that makes this 38 CD box irrisistible and a lifetime investment!<br /><br />WOW is all I can continue to say!
B000WC4A8O|5.0|Dear friends,    This is the best Led Zeppelin vynil pressing EVER! The sound is amazing making us wondering how other vynil records are pressed... - The masters are the same!  The theme selection is the same as the other 2 previous compilations but with this one we have the whole group playing just in front of us with the perfect space between the players!!! The mastering is better than we could possibly imagine! It seems that the band was recorded with today's state of art equipment. Is a unique experience. Congratulations.
0974872407|5.0|This is a great book by all means, it is very well written, very good and different story, great caracters, it's a page turner. I highly recommend it.
B001CZVVVO|5.0|I have had the standard dvd version since it was released however I was shocked to see the vibrancy of the colors, the clarity, and hear the incredible uncompressed sound of this blu-ray. Opera has never sounded or looked this good- we are very lucky indeed.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|as with all his books gladwell entertains and informs,  well constructed, fast read not too in depth
143911000X|1.0|I'm gravely dissapointed at this book, since hardely any of the articles correspond with what Barney has said. Since the previous authors have no clue I felt the urge to inform all potential buyers not to buy this copy. For example, we all know that Bro Code Article 89 is:  The mom of a bro is always off limits, but the stepmom of a bro is always fair game IF she initiates it and/or is wearing atleast one article of leopard clothing  In this travesty Amazon call The Bro Code article 89 is: A Bro shall always say yes in support of a Bro    Do NOT buy this \\"book\\"
0143035711|5.0|As a vet of this war, and someone who has read several dozen books on the subject, this is my personal favorite.  Just bought this copy for a nephew who has become interested in the history of this conflict.  HIghly recommended.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|This comes with a set of 4 (four) 3D glasses and the 3D effects on the television monitor are nothing short of SPECTACULAR!!!!!  My 8-yr.-old niece really loves watching this and it's a real treat for her since she never has had the opportunity, at her age, to see the old 3D movies that were released in theaters in the early 1950s.  I have been praying for the ability to be able to watch 3D on the television screen for many years now and, finally, here it is!  I highly recommend this product!
B0014Z4P6U|5.0|The reason for the price on this blu-ray is because it's an IMPORT... It costs more to bring it in from the UK...
B000000OPQ|5.0|This is an awesome soundtrack.  I recommend to everyone.  Especially if you are into wrestling.
B000002UDB|4.0|I had the original vinyl EP (wonder where it is now?) and I bought the CD a year or two back mainly for nostalgia.    All the Beatles stuff from around this time has a strange feel.  It's a combination of that very English sound and a kind of world-weary feel that suddenly they had aged 100 years in the space of a few months.  The songs have a dreamy spaced out feel but at the same time can be very aware and simultaneously almost childish.  Listening to this again, it's hard to believe that they had been writing songs like Please Please Me only a couple of years back.  Life would never be the same again.    . . . Oh yeah, and it's a good album, even if it's cobbled together from the EP plus a few singles!
030014332X|5.0|This book clearly meant for young readers is engrossing for adults also. Makes what many believe to be boring  fun!
B000M5AJQI|4.0|Just look at the cast and you'll know right away this is a must have. This movie has it all, great acting, twists, and tons of suspense. It's a must see for everyone and a terrifically made movie. Another masterpiece from the master himself, Scorcese.    Get this Blu-Ray!
B001DDBCUK|5.0|Just a little consumers point of view about this movie:  Everyone was dying to know what happened to Big and Carrie, how was life for Miranda after her moving, what went on with Samantha and her relationship that was really lasting and, of course, what happended to our beloved well educated Charlotte.    I believe the end of this series left a void for women, women who where finally seeing their inner voices speaking back at them from the TV set.  It was amazing how friends gather around to do what a lot of people called the Sex and City therapy sessions.  Everything was there:  4 women daring to speak on behalf of millions and giving men a clue on what´s really going on inside a woman´s head when it comes to sex.    You must purchase this movie or your collection wont be complete!!!!
B000E5KOJS|4.0|This DVD of Cosi Fan Tutti is a gift, so I haven't watched it and cannot comment on the quality of the performance, but it shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition.
B000001EUR|5.0|with two kids of my own, I know why my mom hated that album cover! I still dig it though!     Love at First Sting is if not the best...one of the top two albums the 'Scorps released. It still rocks 24 years later and unlike many bands/albums of my head-banging past, I still enjoy listening to these cuts. Even now I occasionally break out the axe and jam along with these tunes....they never get old....unlike me. ;-)
B001E75QH0|5.0|These are excellent movies to watch, they were great when they came out years ago and now that they are on DVD it is that much better. Makes a great present for the Indiana jones fan.  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas on her request and I am sure that she will enjoy them.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I gave it a 5, i figure it will be good. But, I think they are milking the live stuff. Live albums are easy to produce. Suggestion? How about make a new album of new material! And record it live?
0307455874|5.0|The CD version has 5 CDs. Consider getting it because to hear everything spoken by the man himself is something. You realize how intelligent he is and how much America needs this person and how lucky we are he came to the forefront of American politics at this time.
B00005JKBC|4.0|\\"It's Muir's last day before retiring (clich&eacute; alert!)\\" says Amazon review. Lol. That is true. Why they gotta do that? SPY GAME is a good movie though. It's got good acting, was directed well, tells a good story and I always appreciate seeing lots of Europe in a movie. It doesn't paint dark enough a picture of the CIA, an organization that has done enough harm in the world that socially responsible filmmakers should never miss the opportunity to really let those creeps have it, imo. But of course sending a message is not even close to being the whole point of telling a story or making a movie. I'd say, just don't make 'em look good. And SPY GAME does sort of come close, what with none other than Brad Pitt and Robert Redford together on screen. Two of Hollywood's best looking and most charismatic actors. They're cool together. Basically as a young soldier Pitt is recruited by Redford to the Company. They do some work over the years (the hot spots: eastern europe, the middle east)and eventually Pitt becomes disillusioned with spy games and all the shenanigans and murder. Pitt falls in love with a woman. Pitt and Redford go their seperate ways, but before they do Redford has made clear his belief that one should  never stick their neck out. Pitt then gets caught by Chinese authorities trying to save his woman. I'll leave the rest for you to enjoy. I recommend SPY GAME
B000RP4LEO|3.0|The first classical music I ever heard was by Beethoven and the Piano Concerto No. 5 in particular. It showed me that classical music so couched in cobwebs could be hard-core and uncompromising.    After school, I tried to track down that recording but found the swamp of different versions a little hard to handle. After about four different versions, I finally found the one that I deem as perfect.     After many years, I thought I would take the plunge and buy this new version by Hélène Grimaud. It seems that all modern classical albums have a sexy bird on the front cover and I keep asking, are the best all so beautiful?    Not so in this case. I found this performance rather uninspiring and the finger work unsubtle, when compared to my favourite pianists.    In my humble opinion Beethoven's music has a lot to do with rhythm. He obviously had great natural rhythm himself and the best exponents of his music exploit that. Hélène Grimaud is lost in this respect and so the performance comes across as mechanical and soulless.    I suppose it is time to say which is my preferred version of Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto. It is by Wilhelm Kempff and the Berliner Philharmoniker, conducted by Ferdinand Leitner in 1962. No other recording has had such an influence on my appreciation of classical music.
B000000OAN|5.0|Well I am first gonna say that I am not your normal Queen fan, in fact in my younger years I pretty much hated them. I don;t have a good reason for it, it's just that I didn't car for their kind of music, but as I got older I have found some of their songs aren't really that bad. Sot I just bought the album for a few of the song's on it, the rest of them well grow on me in time I guess. The one song I wanted wasn't on this album, that song is \\" We Are The Champions \\"    Well that all I got to say on that matter.    Carl Pierce
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Great show, it just keeps getting better! Both actors are super and work very well together and the story lines are interesting and different.
0316017922|5.0|Outliers, exposes the myth that many people hold that great accomplishments are achieved solely by one's self with no help from anyone else.  Young people just starting should have this information to help them understand that great accomplishments come from a community of efforts and not just from superhuman abilities. Many of the people mentioned in Outliers (Bill Gates, Bill Joy, Paul Allen, Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt) are not often forth coming about how they achieved their greatness, the advantages they benefitted from. Outliers does an excellent job of exposing \\"successful people don't do it alone.\\"
B000M53GM2|4.0|So Bond may be a \\"dinosaur\\" but he took a slight evolutionary step forward with Pierce Brosnan who at the time seemed born to play Bond. So it was the 90s, the coldwar had thawed out, so-called political correctness was in the air and so what's a \\"sexist\\", coldwar warrior, relic of the 1960s to do? Well, pretty much what he's always done. Because really the world hadn't changed so much that women don't no longer go for cocky, smooth talking alpha-males (no matter how p.c. things get) and governments don't use remorseless assassins to spy and kill for them. Heh, Bond's new boss, a woman (it's the 90s see) by the name of \\"M\\", calls Bond a dinosaur but she sure does need him and he's still popular with movie goers. Somethings don't change I guess and sometimes that's a good thing... A James Bond that doesn't know how to have a good time would be Bond in name only and having dumb lighthearted escapist fun is what the Bond franchise is/was all about. (In fairness to the newest Bond, getting serious and tougher is fine, but not caring about your drink and smooth talkin' the ladies is going too far! Bond ain't, and never can be, Jason Bourne) GOLDENEYE surely ranks amoung the top 5 best Bond flicks.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is one of the most eclectic collections of music I've ever come across in a soundtrack.<br /><br />And fairly awesome, brave choices on behalf of the Director, although they fit very well with the characters of the book.<br /><br />I love it and definately recommend it to everyone - fan or not.
0452286379|5.0|I bought a used book in good condition. This book arrived very fast and of course was in a better condition than my expectation. I am happy with my current purchase and would like to continue in future.

Do me a favor and save your money the album has about two ok songs and its not a B'Day ..no good party songs, no good songs period , i thought overall the album sucks and i posted it on ebay and sold it .....thank goodness
031606792X|5.0|I loved Breaking Dawn. One must understand from the very beginning of the Twilight Saga that these vampire stories do not adhere to the conventional vampire lore. Infact, I had a hard time even starting this series because I was sold completely on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles and their very definitive world; in other words, nothing could compare to them-ever. However, when I finally caved in and started reading the Twilight series, I found Meyer's world to be very refreshing indeed.    Of course, in Breaking Dawn the most distinctive variance in vampires occur. Let's just say, I never saw that coming! However, I feel Meyer made her case very clear, defined the \\"how did that happen,\\" and I bought it completely. The entire saga is very compelling, and like I said from the beginning, a complete and finally refreshing take on vampires.     Upon hearing that Meyer's readers did not take to the change as easily as I did astonishes me. Again, from the beginning, most saw and accepted that Meyer's world was extremely different, so why should the ending be any different?     Needless to say, I LOVED IT, and am hoping for more from Meyer. I truly hope that if you enjoyed the first three novels, you are not swayed from other people's opinions, and that you simply read for yourself. Enjoy!
B000MXPE7O|2.0|The main character is a tool and I don't like him and I don't like his terrible life but that's not why I didn't care too much for this film (of course). It's entirely possible to do a movie about an unlikable and even bland character that makes him interesting and sympathetic. In this character study the creation of an even mildly compelling character whose life we take any real interest in was simply not accomplished. This isn't to say Matt Damon did not act well because he seems to have turned in a decent, understated performace that was befitting of the role. The fact that this is a story about a strange man whose life is his work that is also the story of the birth of the CIA lumps it together with a whole slew of movies that affect for the worse my reaction to this espionage, cold war spy drama. Seems like it could have been a lot more engaging to me, and no I don't mean more action. THE GOOD SHEPHERD is an odd film.
B001FBJUKE|5.0|This is a very interesting item in that Rhino chose to release a painfully accurate reproduction of the original package that puts things back as they were instead adding things that were never there. It seems that over the years each pressing of this record (legitimate and otherwise) has taken a little more of the original away. This package brings it all back home on a fine quality of wax.    A review of the contents of the music is pretty much pointless. We all know what it sounds like. It is loud and hard. We know the songs and thought we knew the order. One of the fixes this makes is that it puts the songs back in the order they first came in. In the end most people are buying this as a piece of history so they will never hear a minor difference like that.    Frankly I would be happy if this closed the lid on this piece of musical history. It would be a fitting end to the means. I still think this album in any form holds its own in any format.    The one downside to this release is that some sellers will almost certainly try to pass it off as the original hoping that some sucker wont notice the Rhino logo. Other than that it is a nice addition to the endless stories in the history of the one and only studio album the Sex Pistols recorded and everybody else releases.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Really enjoyed this CD of Bob Dylan's.No wonder it is considered his best.  If you want to try Bob's music, try this one and you will be happy you did.  The service was amazing and very fast.

Bryson is not only a very funny guy, he has a keen eye for detail, especially the traits that make us all human in our own particular, regional way.  I've already started another Bryson book.
1593080255|5.0|This was a rather difficult book to get through.  Lots of old English and lots of footnotes describing what the words or phrases meant.  I struggled through about 3/4 of the book, but then it picked up and I managed to get it read.  In the end, it was worth the time and effort but does take some patience to get through.  Not for everyone.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|For fans of old Hollywood, you'll love this movie!<br />Burton and Taylor are just about at their best here.<br />The constant jab and poke that these two go for is amazing, both looking the vocabular knock out punch!<br />It remans one of my all time fav movies to watch.<br />I encourage everyone who has the slightest interest in how<br />great the old studios made movies to watch this film!
B0007TKNII|5.0|the dvd was amazing and the time they shipped it to me was great it was delivered very fast
0316017922|4.0|Though the book appears to be somewhat boring at one point or the other in what the author is trying to conclude onto, still it has very basic truths and a great insight.    This book really speaks the truth and worth reading once.
B0013DDN5M|5.0|I still play this one all the time. Been a Priest fan since about the time SFV came out. I have nearly their entire catalog, and this is the best in my opinion. To me there are no fillers, and every song is great.  I have an older cd without the extra tracks and re-mastering. The sound quality is wonderful. The songs are very strong. From the opening track to the final \\"I believe I can't stand it any more\\" from Devil's Child an awesome Judas Priest album. Powerful and solid bass work and superb drumming lay a super strong foundation for Glenn and K.K. to trade off  great solos. And this one is chock-full of perfect solos! And Rob as usual  displays the wares of maybe the greatest metal singer of that era.  I know it's kinda cliche', but if you get only one Judas Priest album this should be the one. Thanks for checking out my opinion.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Having seen four shows over both legs of the Snakes And Arrows Tour 2007-2008, I have been counting down the days until this release.  In fact, I have been doing everything in my infinite power not to die before watching this concert video in it's entirity.  One word - AMAZING, AWESOME, SPECTACULAR, TERRIFIC, HOLYCRAPTHISKICKSASS!  Yeah, I said one word - take your pick.  This is the new gold standard on which all future concert dvd's will be judged.  Excellent camera work, great sound and enthralling energy from start to finish.  This is the one - operators are standing by.
0321544080|3.0|I am a landscape and flower photographer so I was disappointed by this book.  It was not the writing, but the subject.  Had it had more landscapes in the process it would have been better for me.  For those that use artifical lighting this is a great book.
0786888628|5.0|Memories are the building blocks of identity, and psychologists have long known that, more than recollections of the past, memories are narratives that have built into them clear lessons consistent with an individual's worldview. What individuals do naturally for themselves historians do for society: write narratives from known facts and events to help bulid a national identity. And that is what David Halberstam does superbly in his masterwork \\"The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War.\\"    In \\"The Powers that Be\\" and earlier works David Halberstam writes in a folksy and plain-speaking manner that comes across as pretentious and arrogant but in his last work this same style has rendered stories and heroes awesome and memorable. Mr. Halberstam is a wonderful storyteller, and he seamlessly weaves from the macro of the political times to the micro of village battles. And as a wonderful storyteller he has rendered the main players fascinating and knowable and the events relevant and immediate.    In Mr. Halberstam's narrative the Korean War was both tragically inevitable and shamelessly avoidable. A war eventually had to be fought between the newly victorious Communist Party of China and the United States, sponsor of the CCP's adversary the Kuomintang. Moreover, the Soviet Union's North Korean puppet leader Kim Il Sung was just as reckless and uncontrollable as America's South Korean puppet Rhee Syngman. Both sought to manipulate their sponsors to grant them Korean unity.    And while war was inevitable the type of war was determined by the stupidity and vainglory of the book's chief villians: Kim Il Sung, Mao Zedong, and ultimately General Douglas MacArthur. Douglas MacArthur may have been responding to a North Korean invasion but by pursuing the North Koreans so far north he forced the Chinese into the war; here his arrogance (that he was the greatest general ever) was supplemented by his racism (that the Chinese were peasant cowards, and wouldn't dare risk a fight) to make a severe miscalculation that would cost thousands of American lives when the Chinese army trapped America's 8th Army near the Chinese border, forcing an embarrassing and deadly retreat. And even though McArthur's advance forced Mao to enter the war no one forced Mao to believe in the indomitable will of his troops, and to hurl tens of thousands of good Chinese infantry against superior American technology and weaponry. For Mao a just ideal is worth more than hundreds of thousands of good soldiers.    The Korean War was forced upon the Americans by the grandiose imperial ambitions of three great dictators (Kim Il-Jung, Mao Zedong, and Douglas McArthur), and was deeply unpopular at home. Worse the Korean War was unwinnable because for the Americans to advance into China would trap them, like the Japanese before, in an enemy country with a seemingly infinite number of enemies. And a Chinese defeat would bring the Soviet Union into the war.    So the Americans led by General Matt Ridgway chose to fight a limited war to inflict the maximum number of casualties against the Chinese, and it was at the fierce seige of Chipyongni that the Americans finally proved to the Chinese superior tactics and technology could defeat their devastating numbers. And by humbling the Chinese without devastating them Matt Ridgway deterred future Sino-American clashes, an important Cold War achievement if not a total victory.    In the end Douglas McArthur was recalled, and even though Mao Zedong cost China the lives of hundreds of thousands of good men he would live another twenty years to kill tens of millions of Chinese. The only winner seemed to have been Joseph Stalin who goaded on the Chinese and whose death finally permitted the Chinese to sign a truce with the Americans.    \\"The Coldest Winter\\" is historical journalism and story-telling at its very best but there are two main problems with the book: the first is that it's written by a great journalist, and the second is that it's written by a great story-teller. Journalists are tremendously adept at researching and reconstructing events but they are not intellectuals, and David Halberstam may be a great journalist but he is still a journalist. Towards the end Mr. Halberstam writes about the historical significance of the Korean War, and the final section feels weak and thin and not at all convincing.    The second problem is more perturbing. The blatant arrogance and flagrant stupidity of the book's villians are too tragically real so it seems as though Mr. Halberstam needs to compensate by diefying the book's heroes: Harry Truman, General Matt Ridgway, the Chinese General Peng Dehuai, and the dozens of American soldiers and officers who fought so bravely and selflessly. If Mr. Halberstam is right about Ridgway then the general was omnipresent and omniscient -- and while Ridgway may be good it's hard to believe he's God.    David Halberstam's \\"The Coldest Winter\\" is a book about the classic battle between good and stupidity, and while historians will question his narrative there's no question that Mr. Halberstam's clear and simple narrative is consistent and coherent with America's larger vision of itself as a good and simple nation sometimes thrown into the nastiest of nightmares and always responding with upmost honor and bravery. That is how Americans want to remember the Korean War, and that is how the Korean War will be remembered.    \\"The Coldest Winter\\" will be the definitive history of the Korean War, and it is the late David Halberstam's proudest achievement.
0452286751|4.0|In the Fountainhead, Ayn Rand presents her philosophy of objectivism told through the lives of her characters.  The protagonist is architect Howard Roark who portrays the epitome of the heroic individual standing against mediocrity.  The villain is media figure Ellsworth Toohey who is known for raising up what is insignificant and tearing down what is excellent.  Don't be surprised if many of the events and dialogue in this book rings true in regard to current events.<br /><br />I read Atlas Shrugged before Fountainhead and found Atlas Shrugged to be much more compelling and a better presentation of Rand's philosophy.  Fountainhead is still worth reading but is not quite as good.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|considering this movie is 14 years old, we think it looks very very good. we also have the original dvd and there is definitely a real smooth look to the blu ray and not so choppy as many regular dvds are on hi def tvs. ours is a sony bravia 1080p resolution and we are very impressed. there's only so much they can do to restore the films. we have other older films on blu ray (the shining, clockwork orange, and a few others) and this one looks more fresh and clean than they do. considering you can get the blu ray for only 20 bucks, it's well worth it. many regular dvds are that much. plus the movie is amazing. we dont normally rate products on here but when we saw all the comments saying the blu ray sucked we just had to speak our minds cuz we think these people are expecting way too much out of a film that is over a decade old.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|I've been trying for years to get this film, and finally it's here.  Just as thrilling as the day it came out.  Now I've got 3 of the 4, fingers crossed the 2nd one becomes available soon!
B001GJOL22|5.0|Although 'Snakes and Arrows' wasn't my favorite Rush tour/set, this is their best Live product they've put out. R30 and \\"Rio\\" were very good. This is even better. The HD looks terrific. The sound is great. The camera work is great. Even after 30+ years, Rush still knows how to put on an unbelievable show. Every live release should look and sound like this. Rush could have easily \\"overpackaged\\" this and sold it for twice as much, but they didn't. They put over 3 hours worth of great music together, and released it to their fans on Blu-ray for $20. Thanks Neil, Geddy, and Alex.
0723257639|5.0|I bought this product for my mother-in-law (at the request of my mother-in-law) who is 79.  She had just seen the movie Miss Potter with Rene Zellweger on TV and wanted to read the books.  I got on Amazon and told her the choices - nothing would do but the boxed set.  And having received it she talks every day about reading one of the little books.  She absolutely loves it.  The illustrations are of course, beautiful and the stories sweet.  The books are as Beatrix Potter thought they should be - little for little hands.  It's a beautiful set.

B0019CSXAM|4.0|Though I could've done without the stunt casting of Britney, How I Met Your Mother Season 3 didn't disappoint! (Plus, since it came back post-strike there are more episodes than a lot of series, so more bang for your buck!)   This series continues to be one of my favorites that I can watch over & over whenever I need a little pick me up!  Highly recommend it!!
B001GM0GNC|1.0|Great shows, some say the best of the tour.  But the audio was mastered by a VIP (very incompetent person) and sounds \\"too loud\\", compressed and lacks detail and dynamics.   Volume stays the same all along the concert...sad

B001GQACGO|2.0|After so much talk of the newly anticipated album, featuring her alter ego Sasha, I was quite surprised.  A lot of ballads, not a typical for a Beyonce CD, but understanding she wanted to do something different.  There is a lot of mixed genre on this CD, appearing as if she wants to crossover into mainstream. I personally did not like the album overall. I went from track to track, asking myself what the hell am I listening to. No clear sound, not R&B, not hip-hop, not pop...WTF! In fairness I am attempting to force my self to listen to it again and again hoping that it will grow on me.  Outside of Single Ladies and If I Were a Boy, there is nothing worth mentioning. Again, my opinion.  If you are expecting Beyonce the way you have heard in the past, this CD is NOT it.  To sum it for  me, I think its garbage. Disclaimer, review before you buy.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|If you have a 1080P TV with 120HZ and high end cables, Wall E is a must own. The picture is literally 3D during the Space Walk Chapter. Other Reviewers are slamming the movie for various reasons (fat people portrayal, not for kids, etc).     If you hated the movie in theaters, why are you clueless &^%$# reviewing the BLuRay when you dont own the disc.     Wall E is really made for Adults and they used a cute robot to make it enjoyable for kids.  Pixar injecting Hello Dolley songs into the movie will probaly introduce a new audience to that movie.  Wall E is a Classic.

0140274111|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is a true American classic.  At 100 pages, it is a quick read, but a must for the faithful reader.  The other 3 short stories included in this compilation are even quicker at about 20 pages each.  Very entertaining.  Good for a light read.
0307269752|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a sprawling thriller that follows financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist as he tries to solve a decades-old murder while simultaneously attempting to resurrect his reputation after being convicted of libel.  In the course of his research into the quirky family of a Swedish industrialist (the beloved uncle of the murder victim), Blomkvist uncovers several more plot lines and bumps into plenty of interesting characters, including a sidekick with a dragon tattoo.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is populated by a large cast of characters, many of which have only small roles.  The principle characters are well-developed and sympathetic, but it can be difficult to keep track of the minor players.  Parts of the story stall in long descriptions of Blomkvist's research methodology, and the book is a bit longer than it needs to be.  Despite these faults, this is an engaging page-turner sure to entertain fans of thrillers and mysteries.

B001ESYAJY|4.0|While the latest Bond film was full of promise but disappointing in the end, one of the aspects of the film that wasn't was David Arnold's score. In fact Arnold follows up his excellent score to Casino Royale with a score that, while not as original as Casino's, is up to the task. The result is an enjoyable score and an enjoyable album.<br /><br />After creating one of the most original scores of the series in Casino Royale, Arnold adheres a little more closely to the traditional Bond score for the film and this album. After making the James Bond Theme non-existent in Casino Royale, Arnold allows it to slip in without it being intrusive. In fact Arnold with one moment in particular perfectly captures the feel of the earlier John Barry scores with the scene of Bond and Fields (Field Trip on this album). While most of the album is terrific, unfortunately the main title theme Another Way To Die is amongst the series worst with some odd lyrics and an odd performance (the duet was a good idea if only the song had been better).<br /><br />Arnold uses Quantum of Solace to show off his ability to make a good Bond score. While it might not be up there with the scores to Casino Royale or On Her Majesty's Secret Service, there is plenty to like about the score to Quantum of Solace is a fine piece of film. Unlike the film, it isn't disappointing in the end.
0618918248|5.0|Now, I am a Danish native speaker and, albeit reading a lot in English, I have only read \\"The God Delusion\\" (\\"Illusionen om gud\\") in Danish translation. However, having read most of the books of Dawkins in English, I tend to believe that I have got the message right. Thus having covered my most used bodypart and further wish to disclaim any professionel knowledge on the subject (I only have an old Danish masters degree in Social Science), it is nevertheless with delight to comment on this book.    It is a book written with humor and charm, knowledge and reason. Four keywords to the writtings of Dawkins in general. But the special thing about this particular book is that it addresses the opposite of all four in one. The book presents a fierce and well documentet attack on religious dogma in an intimate-with-the-reader way (as Dawkins masters so well) and never falls into the trap of becoming dogmatic itself.    After all, the central postulate is that the existance of God has never been proven or even made likely, and that the Hypothesis should be dealt with as any other (failed) Hypothesis. It should at least be testable by reason (if not, \\"especially\\" problematic in this special case, by experiment!) and it has failed to do so. The God delusion as a real comfort may have an appeal (\\"faith in faith equals more comfort\\"), but it still remains pure faith, not an argument for the actual existance of God. Dawkins makes a solid case for challenging God as existant or as of comfort. In fact, I find the stance of Atheism so clearly spelled out that I wonder, why Dawkins makes no reference to Albert Camus (\\"The Myth of Sisyphos\\" etc.), because, in the existentialist Univers of Camus and others, I find grand overlaps to the Darwinian stance. That, in my humble oppinion, is a shortcoming. Dawkins makes a major case - rightly so - of the American \\"Creationism\\" as the religious opponent to scientific reason. I completely agree and I worry too. \\"Gods own country\\" has become tooreligious!     Here are my main concerns with the book. Although Dawkins here and there refers also to Islam as a dogmatic religion, his main target is \\"only\\" Creationism. It seems to me that he avoids - not ignores - the danger to the West posed by the rise of Islam during the recent decades. Religion is a cause of conflict. Overall, the book is predominantly opposing Christian Creationism, not Islam. I wish the critical voice on religion would have sharper teath against the fundamental problems of Islam (not Muslims) than the book presents. That is probably more than is realistically to be expected from Oxford, were the rich elite from muslim countries come with many money to study. I have another problem, which I guess everybody share. Dawkins claims that \\"replicators\\" only had to arise once. Logically true. But in a discussion of God, pro or Con, one cannot avoid discussing the existance of the Universe, which, given the value of \\"six Numbers\\" (Martin Rees) is extremely likely not to give rise to life. Dawkins comes up with astronomical likelyhood figures for life given the Universe, and I personally believe the Universe is full of life, but, it seems we run out of argument for or against God when reversing time to Big Bang. Dawkins has no answer to this. Ultimately he therefore cannot prove or disprove God. God may be a designer. Personally I think of no designer, just a Universe more complicated than physicists can explain. But ultimatly it is no argument concerning God (sorry, Mohammed, bleshed be his name, the Prophet).    Basically it is a very intelligent book and it is full of challenge to othodoxy, dogma and irrationality. This is where Christmas comes in! Dawkins is a civilised person and I guess he too, has a Christmas Party. But this is not religion. It is culture. Santa may be out of reach, but the Christmas Carrols and the Turkey is of this world, and they tune in so well and taste so well that they make heaven on Earth. Even a month before Christmas. Read Dawkins and become a little more clever. We do not believe in Santa, The Banana God , Allah or God as such. I do not.
B00125WAXC|5.0|It's a fabulous film because it gives an overview of historical events in the US and the acting is excellent
0525478183|4.0|I need to keep this short because I don't want to spoiler it, it's the kind of book where the reader just needs to give up control to the author and just go along for the ride and see where it leads. In this case it's a road trip through Florida but metaphorically speaking of course it's a sort of coming of age of a teenage boy.<br />Protagonist Q idolizes next-door hottie Margo and when she disappears he believes that she's left him special clues to find her, so he takes his friends Ben and Radar on a road trip to find her. Yeah it sounds pretty schizophrenic, right? But like I said, let your skepticism go and put yourself in the position of a geeky naive teenage boy and you can kinda see where he's coming from. Attention from a pretty girl can be like a narcotic. He kinda tries to be the white knight and rescue Margo, problem is there are two sides to every story.<br />This is a different kind of book, a bit of a predictable ending, I didn't love it enough to give a five but it was too well written and unique to give a three. I have to be honest, I didn't like either Q or Margo so much, Ben & Radar were much more fun, as sidekicks sometimes turn out to be.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Electric Arguments is indisputably the most surprising and inspiring CD of the year. Paul McCartney surfaces with a masterpiece of experimental music and great vocals that fuse ambient, hard rock, blues, trance, ballads and electronic music. Producer Youth was integral to this CD. It contains arguably the greatest medley of Paul's songs ever commencing with \\"Sing The Changes,\\" \\"Travelling Light,\\" \\"Highway\\", \\" Light From Your Lighthouse,\\" \\"Sun Is Shining,\\" and \\"Dance 'Till We're High,\\".  MACCA and Beatles fans will love this trippy and psychedelic CD becuase it has vintage tracks similar to great songs off the White Album, Ram and Paul's other masterful Fireman CD the cosmic\\"Rushes\\" wherein he expertly played several guitars, cymbals and resplendent keyboards.  MACCA'S roaring, soaring and refined vocals and ambient virtuosity at age 67 are priceless. This is the most vindicating CD of MACCA'S career because it showcases his virtousity as a vocalist, musician, composer and lyricist ! It's safe to say that Lennon would have been impressed by this amazingly creative CD.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|I just got this album and what a musical treat, this is pure Mccartney magic.
B000002LAB|4.0|Here's the thing, recorded in the 80's it has a heavy synth feel to it.  You've got your opinions on synth, it means synthesized, NOT synthetic.  They are still real instruments, being played by real people.  Add the haunting melodies of Miles Davis and you get an incredible juxtaposition of old and new.    Now for the not so good part.  This album was really the forerunner of the bland soft jazz that has been regurgitated for the past two decades.  Sadly it created the groove for programmed backgrounds with moderately talented horn players to try their thing.  IT'S STILL GOING ON.  Heck, it's pretty much soft porn music.    If you're familiar with that type of soulless jazz, you might get a feeling of it from this album, but this album has soul, make no mistake.  Every classic has a thousand pale copies.    I think if you can leave all preconceptions behind, you'll enjoy this album.  It's solid.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|This is a throwback to the Noir style of the 40's and 50's.  It is carried out with style and excellent acting.  A not to be missed movie if you love old fashioned movie making
B000EBD9TY|4.0|The film, A Streetcar Named Desire, is based ultimately on the extreme cultural differences between Blanche Dubois and Stanley Kowalski.  Blanche, a vicarious and unlucky Southern Belle, shows up on her sister's (Stella) doorstep in New Orleans after arriving there on a streetcar route named \\"Desire.\\"  Blanche has a rough background and is hesitant to share the truth of her visit with her sister and brother-in-law Stanley.  She tells Stella and Stanley she lost the family mansion, Belle Reve, because of problems with deceased family members that ultimately resulted in financial losses aka Belle Reve.  In reality, Blanche was fired from her job as an English teacher for having an affair with a 17-year old student and couldn't afford the home anymore.    Blanche tries to keep this past a secret from everyone, but Stanley is skeptical and makes it difficult for her.  Coming from a hard-working, immigrant family, Stanley resents Blanche's luxurious lifestyle in a beautiful mansion in Mississippi.  When Stanley learns the reason for Blanche's visit he sets out to make her life as difficult as possible.  After being raped by Stanley and confronted with his knowledge Blanche has a nervous breakdown.  Stanley commits her into a mental institution and tries to reveal her horrific past.   The 1948 Pulitzer Prizewinning drama, A Streetcar Named Desire, is a sure classic.  Tennessee Williams, an American playwright, opened the play on Broadway in December of 1947 and closed in December 1949 at the Ethyl Barrymore Theater.  Since day one this play has been a hit.  With acting from Broadway's finest like Marlon Brando (Stanley) and Vivien Leigh (Blanche), why would this play not be a sure classic?
0374531269|5.0|In this autobiography, A Long Way Gone, Ishmael Beah tells the story of his Civil War experience. In his tragic story, Beah is trying to share his struggles with the world so that people are aware of what had happened to children in Seria Lone.  Throughout the book Ishmael looses his parents, sister, brother, and friends. For a month or so he is alone until he finds a new group of boys. These boys go though a lot together and end up becoming close friends. Later in the book they find a campsite that is willing to supply them with food and shelter, just what the boys need, in return for one thing; they had to become soldiers to help protect that campsite from the rebels. Ishmael had never planned on becoming a soldier so he was a little hesitant at first, but finally agreed. . As the months went on, Ishmael started to learn to love his life as a soldier and didn't want to give it up, until one day when he had no choice. Ishmael was picked up by a rehab center that helped children stay away from war. He finds out that life outside of the war is a lot different.   Ishmael did a great job in explaining his experience without leaving out any details. I felt his struggle and his emotion that came with it while I was reading his book.   Personally, I loved this book. Most of the time it was hard to put down. As a high school student, the book's descriptions were so vivid and realistic that it almost felt as if it were a movie. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good nonfiction book that is hard to put down.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Liked \\"Blood Diamond\\"? This one concerns drug companies testing new drugs with fatal side effects, only life is cheap in Africa. So there's a coverup. Actually, the film is a love story. Very well made, quick paced, lots of jerky camera work trying to give the illusion of immediacy. You don't have to be a bleeding heart to appreciate the quality of this film.
B001GKYBXA|1.0|I'm a fan of Paul McCartney, but I'm not a fanatic.  This is why I can tell you that it sucks.  Unless you're a collector I wouldn't get this cd, but if you're curious get a friend or a relative to burn you a copy if they have it.  It's not the usual McCartney album.  It's just a buch of music with some vocals thrown at it.  I'm glad I didn't get it.  I really hope that he puts out another cd soon something like \\"Flaming Pie\\" perhaps.  I gave it one star only because I had to.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|-This review pertains to the Director's Cut edition of Donnie Darko-    WARNING: This review contains spoilers! DO NOT READ THIS UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!    In Richard Kelly's Director's Cut of his cult classic, Donnie Darko, we are given nearly twenty minutes of additional footage, which pulls us deeper into the tangent universe. In 2001, Donnie Darko was praised by critics and audiences during its exhibitions at film festivals, however during its theatrical release the film failed to grab the attention of the mainstream U.S. audience. It wasn't until British filmgoers hailed the film as being one of the most original movies of the decade that the film was given a second chance. Now with this 2-disc Director's Cut edition, we can explore the fractured world of Donnie Darko in greater detail. Though the theatrical cut has become a cult classic, the Director's Cut is an even more complete film. Now that Richard Kelly has established himself as a noteworthy director, he's able to reclaim creative control and reassemble the film to match his original vision (20th Century Fox executives ordered the film to be shortened and simplified after a disappointing showing at the Sundance Film Festival). In this new cut, the characters are given more attention, which is wonderful as each member of the cast gives an amazing performance. The story, which will still likely mesmerize most of its viewers, is clarified with the addition of new dialogue scenes.    The story is set in the year 1988, in Middlesex, Virginia. Here Donnie Darko, a troubled teenager, begins to have disturbing blackouts and hallucinations. During these episodes he loses track of time and often regains consciousness only to find himself in some strange place with no memory of how he got there. Donnie's home life is also stressful, as his emotional problems lead to conflicts with his family. One night, after a confrontation with his mother, Donnie is awakened by an eerie voice. It's the voice of a man in a rabbit suit, a man named Frank. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. After Donnie wakes up the next morning in the middle of the country club's golf course, he walks home to find out that a jet engine landed on his family's house, destroying his bedroom. When Donnie returns to school the following day, he is treated like a quasi-celebrity... and he meets the new girl in school, Gretchen. Donnie and Gretchen are immediately drawn to each other. On his ride home from school, Donnie's father almost hits Roberta Sparrow, a reclusive 101-year-old woman, who tells Donnie, \\"Every living creature on Earth dies alone.\\" Donnie confides in his psychiatrist, Dr. Thurman, and tells her about his problems and anxieties.  Meanwhile, Frank tells Donnie to flood the school, which he does by taking an axe to the school's water main. When school is canceled Donnie walks Gretchen home from the bus stop and they develop a close relationship. Donnie is given support by Gretchen, but also by his bohemian teacher, Ms. Pomeroy and his science teacher, Dr. Monnitoff. However he also faces obstacles put in his way by Mrs. Farmer, the school's puritanical and patronizing gym teacher and by Jim Cunningham, a self-righteous and hypocritical self-help guru, who uses cheap New Age philosophy and pop-psychology to control people. Donnie rebels against these two negative influences when he makes an obscene comment to Mrs. Farmer and accuses Jim Cunningham of being the anti-Christ.  One day Donnie asks Dr. Monnitoff what he knows about time travel and Dr. Monnitoff gives Donnie a book that was written by none other than Roberta Sparrow. The book describes an anomaly in which one universe is split into two by a disruption in the space-time continuum. The tangent universe, or secondary universe, is made unstable and will collapse upon itself. This is only preventable if one can travel back in time and stop the tangent universe from being created.If the tangent universe cannot be unmade, if the timeline cannot be corrected then the tangent universe will collapse destroying both itself and the primary universe. Donnie tries to explain these discoveries to his psychiatrist, Dr. Thurman, but she sees no connections between Roberta Sparrow's book and Donnie's \\"hallucinations\\" of Frank. Dr. Thurman believes Donnie to be a paranoid-schizophrenic. Unsurprisingly, Donnie isn't convinced that that's the case. There are too many similarities, too many parallels between the chapters of the book and what Frank has been preparing him for. Donnie consults Dr. Monnitoff about the nature of time travel and how it would be possible, but when the discussion takes on theological overtones Dr. Monnitoff ends their talk.  One night Frank reveals his identity to Donnie, by taking off his rabbit mask. Frank is a young man, not much older than Donnie, and his right eye is missing. Frank tells Donnie that he must burn down Jim Cunningham's house. Donnie torches the house while the rest of the town is at a school talent show. There, Donnie's little sister, Samantha, is part of a dance team called Sparkle Motion. When Sparkle Motion is invited to appear on Star Search, Donnie's parents must accompany Samantha on a plane trip to California. While his parents are away Donnie throws a party for his older sister, Elizabeth, who's just been accepted to Harvard. Donnie and Gretchen leave the party prematurely and a series of incidents lead to Gretchen being killed when a car hits her. Donnie, using a gun he stole from his father's closet, shoots the driver in the face, in the eye. It was Frank. Early the nest morning Donnie watches as a black hole forms in the Earth's atmosphere, dissolving the Earth's gravitational pull, dramatically affecting the weather, and pulling apart the jet that his parents are on. Using the knowledge that Frank gave him, Donnie sends the jet's engine into a wormhole, back through time where it lands on the family's house, destroying his bedroom. By doing this he prevented the creation of the tangent universe, thus saving the world. But because there was no longer the threat of absolute destruction, Frank never died at Donnie's hands; his death was effectively reversed, so his ghost never went back in time to warn Donnie that night that he went sleepwalking. Donnie was in his bed, laughing at the realization of what he'd done, when the jet engine crashed through the ceiling, landing on him. He sacrifices himself to save Gretchen, his family, and the world.    Donnie Darko may very well be one of the most complex, thought-provoking debuts for a filmmaker. Not only does Richard Kelly direct, but he also wrote the meticulous screenplay, which utilizes a knowledge of quantum physics, psychology, mythological archetypes, religious concepts, and modern moral and family issues. The film's multi-layered characters are portrayed by a talented ensemble cast including Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie Darko, Holmes Osborne as Mr. Darko, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Elizabeth Darko, Daveigh Chase as Samantha Darko, Mary McDonnell as Mrs. Darko, James Duval as Frank, Patrick Swayze as Jim Cunningham, Beth Grant as Mrs. Farmer, Jena Malone as Gretchen, Noah Wyle as Dr. Monnitoff, Drew Barrymore as Ms. Pomeroy, and Katharine Ross as Dr. Thurman.    The 2-disc Director's Cut DVD includes an audio commentary with Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith, Production Diary documentary, They Made Me Do It Too- The Cult of Donnie Darko featurette, Storyboard-to-Screen featurette, #1 Fan: A Darkomentary featurette, and the Director's Cut trailer.

B00097E4A6|5.0|There is nothing more exciting than putting the Lego Duplo Thomas series together with my 2.5 year old. The bridge is a bit complicated to figure out at the beginning but it helps to keep the box for a few days to look at the picture. Now we can put it together in no time. It not only lets him practice hand-eye coordination but teaches him how three dimensional objects fit together. Great toy, especially when you have other parts of the Thomas series to add on to it.
B001DU8T6S|5.0|Call me a purist but I love things the way they are. Queen died when Freddy did ( God rest his soul). I think the stuff Queen did in their hey dey, is classic and is what rock bands today should look up to. However to call the band Queen is a crime. Nothing against Paul Rodgers, hes amazing. Hes one of the best vocalists out there. Ive admired him with Free, Bad Company, The Firm, and even The Law. Hes top notch and he has my repect.Roger Taylor has always been one of my favorite drummers and hes as good as ever on here. He also co-writes all of the songs. I just have a problem with Brian calling this outfit Queen. I wish he wouldnt do it.    On the flip side . This album is great. Its what classic rock n roll purists crave for. Brian is at his best, the backing vocals are amazing and of course Pauls vocals are as good as ever. Getting the band in the studio was a brilliant idea. I hope this isnt a one shot album and i hope the boys plan on making more. The songs to down load are .... C- lebrity.Say its not true. Warboys. Surfs up... and Voodoo. If your a Classic rock fan. Buy this album . Its a great one. I cant wait to hear them live.If you spend the dollar more theres also a deluxe version which features the boys from their last concert.

B000FVQM2Y|4.0|In up and coming director Rian Johnson's film Brick, audiences are treated to a truly unique and memorable mystery film. Inspired by the literary work of the great detective novel writer [[ASIN:1883011671 Dashiell Hammett]], who is best known as the creator of Sam Spade and The Thin Man, Rian Johnson set out to create a hip, contemporary noir film. While simultaneously following in the footsteps of great mystery writers like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, Johnson succeeds in revitalizing the detective genre for a new generation, and he does so by making a drastic departure from the traditions of typical film noir. Rather than setting his story in a decaying metropolis full of smoky rooftops and shadowy alleyways, Johnson places the story and its characters in the suburbs of modern day Southern California. He transforms the hard-bitten stereotyped figures of pulp novels into world-weary teenagers and he updates the all-too-familiar dialogue of detective films, turning it into something more improvisational and poetic, almost as though the film's dialogue was part of a jazz song. Though the highly stylized dialogue limits the commercial accessibility of the film, it is arguably what gives the story its refreshing flavor. Using a combination of 1940s slang and modern pop terminologies, Johnson dislocates viewers from reality and relocates them in a \\"shadow world\\", where every darkness hides behind it a secret and every soul is haunted by their misdeeds. Yet somehow the film avoids pretension and self-importance, which is truly remarkable in itself.    When Brendan, an anti-social and extremely street savvy high school senior, receives a distressed phone call from his ex-girlfriend, Emily, who cryptically asks him to help her, he doesn't know what to do. They had broken up a few short months earlier when Emily began hanging with the wrong crowd; the rich, the snotty, the over privileged and then the low-level drug dealers and a host of other less than savory peers. Brendan had tried to protect her from their corrupting influence, from their world of drugs, sex, and violence, but his efforts failed and Emily left him for a drug dealer named Dode. Now Brendan sees his chance to help her, to save her from self-destruction if it isn't already too late... but it is. Learning that Emily was meant to meet someone for a late night meeting in a tunnel, Brendan shows up hoping to talk to her. Instead he finds her dead body. After hiding her body, Brendan begins to set into action a plan to find those responsible for Emily's \\"downfall\\". Naturally Brendan, being somewhat of a lone wolf, doesn't have direct access to the same cliques that Emily did. He goes to his brilliantly resourceful friend, Brain, who seems to have the dirt on just about everyone in school. With Brain's help, Brendan infiltrates a world of drug dealers, of adolescent femme fatales, of snitches and sneaks, and of conspiracies. Soon the trail leads him to a local urban legend regarding a drug dealer known as The Pin (short for The Kingpin), who lives in his parents' basement. When Brendan finally makes his way into The Pin's circle and meets his \\"hothead\\" bodyguard Tug, and his slinky and seductive gal pal Laura, he has no clue of the level of danger and deception that surrounds him. As the intrigue is elevated so too are Brendan's troubles. It doesn't take him long to figure out that \\"there's not much chance of coming out clean.\\"    It should be pretty obvious that Brick is in no way an attempt to portray high school realistically. Rian Johnson has, in fact, succeeded in making high school even more oppressive and agonizing. Who knew that was even possible?  Another great strength of the film is its use of atmospheric and highly evocative music. The [[ASIN:B000EDWLHI beautifully haunting score]] was created by Rian Johnson's cousin, Nathan Johnson, who heightens the story's emotional subtext and the dramatic tension in a devastating manner.  The film features a talented young cast including Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Brendan, Lukas Haas as The Pin, Noah Fleiss as Tug, Norah Zehetner as Laura, Matt O'Leary as Brain, Noah Segan as Dode, and Emilie de Ravin as Emily. The cast also features Meagan Good, and in a cameo role, Richard Roundtree of [[ASIN:0790743752 Shaft]] fame. The entire cast is really spectacular, especially when you consider the difficulty of delivering such strange, stylized dialogue with a sense of sincerity.

B000PFT1ZU|1.0|No matter what anyone thinks or says (including Julian Schnabel) this is not a great album by any stretch of the imagination.  It's mostly a collection of leftover Velvet Underground songs linked together.  Incredibly overproduced (horns, strings, choirs, etc.) and nearly unlistenable.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Great set list, super camera work and perfect sound. I really don't know how they could of done any better with this other than the digipack it comes in. This is the best concert DVD I have seen or heard to this day. There also is some real funny bits sprinkled all over this baby that had my wife and I laughing throughout the show. This is not a greatest hits package but an awesome compliment to the two previous live Rush DVD's. The Snakes and Arrows material is some of their very best and goes over well live. A must have for any die hard or casual Rush fan.

B001HDO4Z6|4.0|With their current album just 5 months old and still warming up the upper reaches of the charts, Coldplay release an EP of out takes, remixes, and outright new tracks, with the threat of a new album for fall 2009. Are they prolific or what?<br /><br />\\"Prospekts March\\" comprises 8 songs, opening with \\"Life in technicolor II\\" which is essentially the instrumental \\"Life in technicolour\\" from \\"Viva la vida...\\" with lyrics and and more of the upbeat parts. The chorus of this appears again in the closing acoustic (almost Folk) ballad \\"Now my feet won't touch the ground\\".<br /><br />\\"Postcards from far away\\" is a 48 second long piano sonata which is simply beautiful but too brief. \\"Glass of water\\" is a towering stadium-esque rocker, the type they do so well these days. \\"Rainy day\\" is an upbeat song filled with violins and faint dance effects.<br /><br />\\"Prospekts March/Poppyfields\\" as its name implies is a suite of two songs, a laid back dreamy acoustic song (\\"Prospekts March\\"), and a chiming 40 second long coda (\\"Poppyfields\\").<br /><br /> \\"Lost\\" (which always lent itself to a faint Hip hop beat, in my opinion) features a (rather pointless) rap from Chris Martin's chum  Jay-Z, while \\"Lovers in Japan\\" gets a vaguely discernible makeover as the Osaka Sun Mix.<br /><br />For Coldplay die-hard fans, worth it just for tracks 2, 3, 4 and 5 alone.

B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B0009FU0ZQ Stone Cold]]    Very good made for TV film, three others have been made as well based on this series. Selleck is excellent as Police Chief Jesse Stone. Terrific supporting cast esp. Viola Davis as the hard to impress deputy/dispatcher.  Fans of Magnum may be surprised to see the Jesse Stone character is quite different, much darker, more flawed. Selleck plays this role with gritty realism. Definitely a don't miss for Selleck fans or lovers of the murder mystery genre.

0307388840|4.0|There's no doubt that Ian McEwan is a terrific writer. His prose...the interplay between the intricate thoughts of the characters and the descriptions of the settings are beautiful..I loved that line about Cecilia's dress worshiping the curves of her body. Those war scenes..like a piece of a Heironymous Bosch painting. So many other great bits too, but to me, I find it part of the English writing tradition to have a stew of simmering passion, often detached over-wrought and intellectualized, just below the surface which carefully never spills over. Words never said. Somber looks exchanged. Clipped cryptic meanings. Me, I happen to like things a bit more messy and expansive. Still, I enjoy Ian McEwan's measured pleasure.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|The story starts with Emma Thompson's voice narrating an ordinary morning in IRS agent Harold Crick's (Will Ferrell) life, a perfectly normal beginning to a movie, until he looks confused and looks around, and the voice stops, then resumes. He's hearing a voice narrating his life, and naturally, it causes a lot of havoc.    He tries to ignore it, but the strain starts to show, so a co-worker gives him the \\"easier\\" of two audits--a baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Of course, it's not easier, because the baker is not only a free spirit who'd dropped out of law school to become a baker and who's refusing to pay the percentage of her taxes pertaining to the defense budget, but he's also extremely attracted to her.    Harold consults a psychiatrist, though he's sure he's not crazy, then a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman), who after initial resistance, finds the problem fascinating. Turns out Harold Crick is the main character in novelist Kay Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) latest book, and he's screwed, because she always kills her main character in the end.    Ms. Eiffel, meanwhile, is suffering from writer's block, and her publisher sends an assistant (Queen Latifah) to help prod her along.    It's such a clever, fascinating story--the collision of fiction and real life, and it's twisted just a little differently from other stories I've read about fictional characters coming to life, though maybe I just haven't read the right stories. What makes it wonderful, though, is that that isn't all there is to the story.    There's also the love story between Harold and the baker, which was sweet and believable. Her free spirit is a perfect foil for his regimented existence. He makes missteps that aren't silly or cliched, but rather in line with his character, and she reacts in character as well. Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal bring the characters to life so convincingly you forget they're just acting.    There's the story of the author's writer's block and her attempts to foil it--standing at the edge of her desk trying to imagine jumping from a tall building, and the hilarious scene from the previews when she's going through the hospital looking for dying people. The assistant's calm but determined demeanor works so well with the author who's alternately stuck inside her head and going off on flights of fancy. Again, Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah are just perfect in the roles.    And the whole thing makes Harold reevaluate his life, which in turn makes the audience think, and we discussed it for days afterward. My men enjoyed it as much as I did.
031606792X|1.0|Firstly, I really enjoyed reading the first three books in the Twilight series.  Even though they contained a dose of cheesy, I kept on reading because the romantic love story of Bella and Edward was compelling.  I have to add that I do not think much of Ms. Meyers writing abilities but I could forgive her the lack of those while the story was still well imagined and the cheesy was kept in some balance.  Breaking Dawn simply bulldozed through all the barriers of acceptably cheesy, tasteless and completely irrational.  The scale just tipped so far to that side that it was no longer the story I enjoyed so much in the beginning.    From the point where Bella realizes that she is pregnant (which isn't too far on in the 800+ page book), I felt that I could comfortably predict the ending Ms. Meyers had in mind.  I already knew the ending and still had over 600 pages to go.  That can't be good!  I hoped (faintly) that there would be some kind of a twist further down the road but all I got were some wild, cheesy, completely irrational and impossible (even in the world of fantasy, and that's saying something) behaviors and events.  Bella is no longer Bella but some crazy pitiful martyr mother wannabe.  The fact that Edward could suddenly spawn little vampire children who butcher their mother's bodies prior to being born made him look quite repelling to me all of the sudden too. If Ms. Meyer's intended message was pro-life (which some have assumed), I think she may have inadvertantly made a stronger case for the opposite.    The point I'm trying to make is that what made the first three books worth reading was that you could vicariously live the female fantasy through Bella by identifying in some way with her (she's clumsy, insecure and human but she's loved unconditionally by a handsome, wealthy man with superpowers) and by yearning for an Edward of your own.  By the time I got to page 400, I was repelled by them both. The charm of their characters was gone and it was replaced by feelings of pure pity.  All of the sudden they were both so pathetic and arguably even mentally ill.  In my opinion, one last chapter in book 3 should have replaced the entire fourth book and Breaking Dawn should never have been written.

This one was done right!  The transfer is beautiful!  I saw things watching this version that I have never before noticed, like how the recently staked Marco's dried blood on the Frog brothers resembles sparkly fairy dust in the sunlight as they escape the cave; a nice nod to Peter Pan there.  Good disc, worth adding to your Blu-ray collection.

0375826726|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I am not mad at the storyline. The storyline is still good. It is a creative story which draws on past success but most greats do. My problem with the book is the fact that he decided to turn it into a 4 book cycle instead of the original trilogy because he could not tie up all the loose ends in just one book. I can not figure out why. This third installment of the book was easily 300-400 pages of fluff. Over half the book could of been cut out or condencesed and the parts of book four could of been added maybe the book would of been 100 pages longer at the end then this one but it would still of been smaller then one of the Harry Potters and smaller then most of the Wheel of time series.<br /><br /> Travel was a good part of this book with nearly 100 pages devoted to one or both of the two stars traveling yet other then that nothing happening. I found myself wanting to skip entire pages and just skim over them to find out when they reach there destination since nothing else was going on. It was getting kinda irksome by the end.
B0006AZMFM|4.0|In the midst of the hype surrounding her debut album, Aussie singer Delta Goodrem found out that she had cancer. It's not surprising, then, that the majority of the tracks off her sophomore record are about dealing with a deadly disease. With one foot in her early years and a lyrical glimpse at her future recordings, \\"Mistaken Identity\\" truly straddles two worlds - innocent child and mature adult.    Delta Goodrem became well-known for a variety of reasons: one is surely her voice, which often draws comparisons to that of Celine Dion. The second is her piano playing. Like her debut, \\"Innocent Eyes\\", this album is full of the piano, from simple ballads to sweeping orchestral-like arrangements. 'The Analyst', in particular, features an unforgettable piano accompaniment.    Like everyone else, I have some favorite tracks from the record. 'Be Strong' is a gentle look at life's tough times, while the title track is a jazzy nod to the changes in life that we don't ask for. 'Electric Storm' clearly details the difficulties that can accompany love, and 'A Little Too Late' describes the frustration that a teenager who has been through more than most feels at the way the world insists on treating her like a child.    Overall, the common thread weaving through the album is undoubtedly the disease that plagued Delta in the years before it was released. The lyrics are raw and vulnerable, nearly painful in places. It's rough around the edges, but this only adds to its charm. And, while I prefer both \\"Innocent Eyes\\" and \\"Delta\\" to this one, \\"Mistaken Identity\\" is a unique record filled with emotion.

The venue is intimate (around 350 people), acoustically incredible and there's truly not a bad seat in the house. I consider it one of the highlights of my life to have seen this stellar musician live.  This DVD definitely does not disappoint!

0385340567|2.0|Jack Reacher is truly a wonderful character, but this book loses touch with him.  The ending is hurried and struck me as contrived, rather than polished, which is the norm for Lee Childs.    I'm sure it's very difficult to create new and interesting material repeatedly, but this character deserves the extra effort.  As an idea, why not try bringing the character full circle with a reason and desire to stop drifting and become involved in a current real-life military or geopolitical situation - maybe working with something like Blackwater or the like?  Thanks for one of the more interesting and enduring characters around!  Please try again - great reads until this one - all other Reacher books are worth every minute and dime spent on them!

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Yes, all Rock fans should have this one in their collection.  Rush and all that were are part of making this DVD completely got it 100% perfect on this one.  This is how a Rock DVD should be.  They missed the mark in their last 2 DVD's with poor sound on the RIO DVD and then R30 didn't include the complete concert material; however on this Snakes & Arrows DVD you get a full complete concert and then extras with the Atlanta show completing the added songs for the 2nd leg of the tour.  I was able to go to 4 shows in all on this tour and was excited to see that this DVD brought back some great memories of the shows I attended.  The picture quality is perfect, the filming of the shows has a feel like you are actually there at the show and the sound quality is by far one of the best concert DVD's I have in my large collection.  I listened to it in 5.1 and also Stereo and I actually found the Stereo sound to be much more fuller and a much more real sound.  Try them both as they are both exceptional.  This is a must for all Rush fans as I know we Rush fans already have this and a great start for many new fans as well as all Rock fans.  Enjoy!!
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|I hope people are not trying to make AC/DC out to be more than they are. No, there's nothing diverse here. No, it's not going to be album of the year. But c'mon man, it's AC/DC. Pure and simple. I think too many people are looking for them to change, and it's not going to happen. Although I think this album is way better than the last one, it's still the AC/DC formula: straight ahead, simple rock and roll. If you're searching for a killer metal album, don't look here. Besides, AC/DC isn't a metal group. They're a hard rock/bluesy type of band. However, if you want a cool AC/DC album that you can put on and listen to some crankin' tunes, this album won't let you down. The boys have been doing this for over 35 years, and they can still rock. \\"Rock and Roll Train\\" by itself is worth the price of this album. But I think all the tunes are pretty cool. Just don't try to be a music critic when listening to it, and you'll be alright.

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I've been a Rush fan since 1912... kidding, since 1976.  The 'fossil' that I am, i've probably seen them at least 40 times live beginning with the 'Farewell To Kings' tour way back when.  I have all their CD's and DVD's.  I have played their LP's (vinyl records) on an old 'Fisher' tube stereo receiver with 'Realistic' (Radio Shack) speakers, and 8-track tapes back in the day (70's).  As an older '40-something' audiophile now thankfully making more than a high school kid did back then, I can now listen to them via high-end McIntosh equipment and Magneplanar hi-res speakers.  Rush never sounded better!  That said, and with my high expectations, this 'Snakes & Arrows' live DVD is INCREDIBLE, visually and sonic-wise!  THIS IS HOW A LIVE CONCERT DVD SHOULD BE DONE!  The camera work is stellar, with a good mix of closeups, medium range, and whole stage shots.  Audio is excellent, both in stereo and in 5.1.  And best of all, Rush is in absolute top form, moving, playing, and singing as if they were 25 again!  This is a MUST OWN concert for Rush and/or prog rock fans!

This is All the Right Reasons with an over-polished \\"electronic\\" sound to the drums and guitar.  Mutt Lange has mastered some phenomenal albums over the years, but this is not one of them.  At one point I really thought I was listening to \\"Animals\\" then realized it was track 5 \\"Next Go Around\\", just substitute the words.  More boozing, partying, and girls that are sang about as desirable, but actually sound like festering pools of STD's.  I did find the one song \\"Just to Get High\\" entertaining, because it sounded like they were watching Boogie Nights and wrighting the song, which I really like that movie.  This album is alright, but not one to get speeding tickets over getting to the store.  If you are not a huge fan, this one can sit.

B00005JL3A|5.0|Paul Anderson's \\"Resident Evil\\" was released in 2002 and is based on the video game of the same name. I don't play video games so this review is based solely on the film.<br /><br />Since its release I never gave the film any thought, but the red poster & DVD cover with Milla Jovovich in a ripped red dress somehow snuck into my subconscious over the years. Then I caught a 15-minute snippet of the film while channel surfing (not knowing it was \\"Resident Evil\\"). The part I saw was near the beginning where Milla mysteriously wakes up in a shower in a mansion. She obviously doesn't know who she is or where she's at and wanders around the mansion trying to figure things out when -- BAM! -- something happens, but I don't want to give it away.<br /><br />That's all I saw. I didn't have time to watch anymore but I decided right there to pick up the DVD. The set-up is intriguing and brilliantly executed.<br /><br />***PLOT SPOILER*** (Don't read the next paragraph unless you want to know the basic plot)<br /><br />A biological \\"accident\\" causes the supercomputer that runs an underground complex to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. This installation is called The Hive. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and a commando force is sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer -- the Red Queen -- to shut down the facility and kill the people. It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies, which may sound totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable, for a sci-fi movie anyway. Milla and the commandos slowly discover the truth. Can they get out alive?<br /><br />***END SPOILER***<br /><br />POSITIVES:<br /><br />- As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.<br /><br />- The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.<br /><br />- Milla herself is stunning. The entire film she runs around in a red dress with a slit up the side. Her face and expressions are magnificent.<br /><br />- The story itself and the delivery (sets, etc.) ring of brilliance. This is sci-fi of the highest order.<br /><br />- The film features a cool eerie score highlighted by some rocking nu-metal acts.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:<br /><br />- Although \\"Resident Evil\\" is original in many ways it's sometimes reminiscent of other films like \\"Aliens\\" and \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". Hence, some things are predictable; for instance, you know anyone who gets bitten by a zombie is gonna eventually turn into one.<br /><br />- To be expected, the mystery build-up in the first hour is better than the last half hour, which is action-filled. Why? Mindless action with numerous quick edits somehow always becomes boring. Wouldn't it be great if a sci-fi-horror film like this ended in a truly unconventional blow-your-mind way (like the original \\"Planet of the Apes\\")? But the final sequence makes up for it, sort of. Besides, since the film is based on a video game the slaughter comes with the territory.<br /><br />The film runs 95 minutes before the credits roll.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: A-f is stunning.

B001GQO50I|3.0|I received my copy of Live at the Matrix last week and did not have time to listen to it. After reading all the negative reviews, I made it a point to listen to the cd's to determine if I was ripped-off. For those unaware, Rhino has had lapses in quality control. Go to the Grateful Dead's web site [.....] and review some of the customer comments on the Dead's latest live releases. These are all released by Rhino. I have ordered most of the Dead's latest live releases and have experienced some of the issues myself. I even purchased a 10 disc set for [.....] with skipping problems on disc two.  That being said, I did not find the Live at the Matrix released that bad. I heard all the warnings on the sound problems (Light my Fire), but I have to admit I enjoyed listening to this from beginning to end. I actually listened to it again right after the first listening still I think it is still a good purchase. Maybe I have become immune after all the Grateful Dead problems. I don't understand why the sound wasn't cleaned up (Light my Fire) before release unless the disc's are defective similar to the 10 disc set from the Dead. Unfortunately, don't expect Rhino to come forward and fix these sound issues or defective discs.  I still recommend this Door's release but Rhino needs to get it's act together.
1594201927|5.0|\\"Those who don't learn from History are doomed to repeat it!\\"  - George Santayana<br /><br />The current financial crisis has got almost everyone re-evaluating their financial situations.  I am no different.<br /><br /> Knowledge is power and with all the shenanigans on Wall Street today it is critical for financial survival to become as knowledgeable as possible about money and finances.  This is accomplished by reading top notch information that can help you make wise decisions about your financial future.<br /><br />Fortunately we live in a time when quality \\"just in time\\" information is available.  Ferguson's book fits into this category.  It is a crucial piece of the knowledge needed to understand the history of money and what others have done in the past when they were faced with financial Armageddon.<br /><br />Although history doesn't repeat itself exactly, it does provide important clues to today's economic meltdown and how the survive...and maybe prosper in the future.<br /><br />As Ferguson states in the Introduction: \\"The more integrated the world's financial markets become, the greater the opportunities for financially knowledgeable people wherever they live -and the bigger the risk of downward mobility for the finically illiterate.\\"<br /><br />He goes on to say: \\"The rewards for `getting it' have never been so immense. And the penalties for financial ignorance have never been so stiff.\\"<br /><br />There are many excellent historical examples in the book that provide key elements to the mindset of the best financial experts who have ever lived.  How others in history (such as the Rothschild family) made their fortunes...and mistakes, teaches how proper planning and execution can be applied successfully to make money.  It also teaches how chance and fate work their way into the equation.<br /><br />Ferguson's book is a key element in learning about money.  He occasionally delves off topic and can lose the reader if not cautious; however this is a small price to pay for the knowledge contained between the pages of this book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0137142900 Financial Shock: A 360º Look at the Subprime Mortgage Implosion, and How to Avoid the Next Financial Crisis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0470292776 Chain of Blame: How Wall Street Caused the Mortgage and Credit Crisis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0595437087 The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking]]ges of this book.

B000683VI4|5.0|I so enjoyed the DVD/ Story. Have seen it twice and will be viewing it again soon. N. Sparks doesn't write a bad story!!
0575081406|1.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a book-seller at a leading book store retailer. I told her I was looking for something in the Tolkien genre and this was her choice. I will always from this point on not base a book selection solely on a book-seller's endorsement.    The paperback version is over 700 pages long. Don't waste your time! I still can't figure out if this is a Tolkien wannabe with some elements of Harry Potter? It is neither.    It is the winner of the Quill Award. I'm not sure what that is, but after reading this I don't care what it is and would never make a reading selection on the basis of this award.    There is little character development with the exception of the leading character Kvothe. Outside of wanting to attend the \\"University\\" and seeking revenge for the murder of his family to an evil, mysterious Orc wannabe group called the Chandrians, you learn little about him. You won't want to know anymore about him.    We again have another wannabe in the form of \\"The University\\" It is no Hogwarts. What little we know about the faculty is they are cruel, petty and vindictive. The curriculum is totally a mystery and I quickly lost any interest in needing to know any more about it. The highlight of the University is the whipping post, perhaps the author thinks every institution of learning should have.    I was getting so bored reading this I skipped at least 50-100 pages to get to the end and try to figure where this story is going. I still don't know, nor do I want to know.     I believe there is a sequel and this story will become a trilogy. I will certainly not waste $7.99 plus tax and more importantly my time on them.
1591841992|2.0|It's a cute book with a heart. Its novelty is eschewing computer-generated graphs in favor of good old fashioned stick figures. At one point, this nostalgia goes too far: the multivariate plot of the accounting software landscape needs visualization software. In fact, often. The book's case study unwittingly makes the anti-case for pictures; for several business challenges, a simple picture belies a situation that, in real life, would demand a deeper analysis.     Does the book give \\"a new, better way to solve problems and sell ideas?\\" Nope, sad to say. Few usable takeways. Instead, a painstaking parsing of the *very* familiar. The anchor is the journalistic six ways of seeing: who and what, where, why, when, how, and how much. I did enjoy being reminded, but still felt empty at the end.     There are a couple of highlights, including the discussion of simple versus elaborate (i.e., the opposite of simple is not complex). As the author says, \\"the real goal of visual thinking is to make the complex understandable by making it visible, not by making it simple.\\"  Then he proves the point with a story about Jeff Hawkins, who uses two versions of a diagram to show how the brain works, a simple and a complex. He typically shows both versions of the brain to both newbie and scientific audiences, but what's cool is that the order of presentation matters, depending on the audience!    The case study at the end, to pull everything together, falls flat. If client problem were addressed this way, precious time would be wasted, er, doodling. It looks fun, don't get me wrong. Each challenge is reflexively met with the question, what picture can we draw? This turns out to be its own kind of error. With most examples, the case tends to either (i) over-reach in almost comical proportions; e.g., using a single bubble chart to set an entire strategy or (ii) pictorally trite; e.g., building an org chart is unnecessary graphical overkill to remind ourselves that we sell to different buyers within the client.    Perversely, then, the case study, by insisting that every step (even the obvious) be met with a picture, manages to undermine the valid premise of the book. It proves: not all problems should be, or need to be, met with pictures. The book does not succeed because it really never gets much beyond a \\"see Jane run\\" sort of metaphor; it never uses pictures for an adult challenge. It is much nearer to an introductory tutorial on basic chart types than insight into information design. One irony of the book is that it is filled with Tufte's chartjunk: visual elements that do not add information.    Two stars because (i) the degree of difficulty is really high (solving problems with pictures is a big hairy audacious goal, a goal with solutions far beyond this book) and (ii) one star feels impolite to the fun vibe of the happy face stick people.
0316067601|5.0|Marcus Luttrell, the lone survivor of a clandestine military operation by Seal Team 10 in remote Afghan mountains, decided to tell this story because he heard someone who was not there had the same plans. It was the largest loss of life in SEAL team history but Marcus wanted to honor the memory of his teamates; Danny, Shane, James, Axe and Mikey. What results is a totally gripping story of courage and heroism against insurmountable odds, infused with surprising morality and sacrifice by Americans and Afghans.     Extremely well written, captivating and moving, Luttrell takes the reader back to his own decision to join the SEALs, the arduous training and the unique camaraderie that develops within the SEAL team. He describes the modern day warrior mystique and the bullet proof mentality that results. Necessary ingredients in the type of soldier capable of answering the call when missions like Operation Redwing are in order. \\"That's my kind of stuff. Backs to the wall. Never give in. Courage, risks, daring beyond compare\\".    In a very intimate way, Marcus helps you to know his teamates as if you had met them or briefly been part of the team. Their individuality, hopes, plans, dreams and family connections. There is no better way he could have accomplished the goal of paying honor and tribute to each of them. \\"Danny, Shane, James, Axe, Mikey and Marcus. Here on business, trained to the minute, armed to the teeth and all set to drive the armies of the Taliban and al Qaeda right out of the mountains\\".    Not long into their mission, the team is discovered by goat herders. Unarmed civilians. To preserve the mission's integrity and their safety they should have killed them but they take a vote, which results in their release. Within an hour the team is under fire from nearly 100 Taliban fighters from which only Marcus survives. They fought relentlessly for each other's survival, never giving in or assuming that they could not overcome.     Marcus had been the deciding vote for their release and now, nearly every waking hour of his life since, Marcus thinks of that fateful decision. \\"No night passes when I don't wake in a cold sweat thinking of those moments on that mountain. I'll never get over it. I cannot get over it. The deciding vote was mine and it will haunt me till they rest me in an East Texas grave\\". Marcus went to the families of each of his fallen brothers and described their courage and heroism. He also went back to active duty and served until very recently.    This story is heartwarming and heartbreaking. Luttrell's ache over his fallen comrades is palpable. Yet, meeting these extraordinary individuals is absolutely inspiring. Their dedication to each other, to the mission, to the SEALs and to our country will improve your patriotism and your confidence in the calibre of our brave military personnel.
B001FSDOZO|3.0|I actually don't understand why everybody loves this CD.  I thought it was really high school and juvenile.  I think I was expecting more \\"If Everybody Cared\\" and less \\"I need to get laid.\\"  If I just listen to the music and don't listen to the lyrics, I enjoy the album.  But when I actually start listening to the songs, I have to wonder what grade people were in when they wrote the words.
B000FIMG68|3.0|I was hooked on this show after the first season. I thought it was brilliant and constantly kept me intrigued and enthralled. The second season lost me a little. It wasn't bad. It was still entertaining, but just started to get a little bit ridiculous in its plot. Still good to watch, but nowhere near as good as season one.
0060594896|5.0|I've read many self help books over the years and Jack's book, The Success Principles, is by far the best! It's easy to follow and so helpful - forces you to do something about your life with the work it tells you to do. It's simply invigorating! This book has already changed my life to be more positive, uplifting, and to live my life to the fullest! I was so thrilled with this book I bought my husband and my 2 sons their own copies. Thank you, Michele :-)
0143034901|5.0|I didn't want this book to end.  I read it slowly to savor every word.  When I find books like this, it spoils me for other books and I have a hard time finding what to read next--because nothing seems as good as this one.  I can't wait until 2009 when this author will publish another book in English. If you liked The Historian, you'll love this book!
0385340990|5.0|This was a great book - I liked the letter format and learned about Guernsey and the occupation of that island during World War II that I was not ever aware of.  I recommend it and would like to read more stories like this one.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Like I said, best action hero movie in a long time: humor, not too-corny, great special affects and great acting.
B001FEO6PK|5.0|This is an incredibly beautiful and diversified mostly instrumental album. A must have for electric guitar fans. There are some tunes featuring the prodigious Jason Becker playing before he came down with ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Although now paralyzed, he still composes with the use of technology and his music is majestic, passionate and uplifting. To perform his compositions he has vocalists and symphonic strings as well as some of the best guitarists around. Contributing guitarists include Steve Hunter, Steve Vai, Greg Howe, Marty Friedman, Joe Satriani and Michael Lee Firkins. These monumental artists do a wonderful job conveying the  soulfullness of these compositions. Every number is a gem. A very impressive album.
1594201927|1.0|Mr. Ferguson has a set pattern in his writings of lots of magician tricks to make the audience believe the show is real by telling them Jeopardy question facts before moving on to not pointing the real finger of Truth at anything.  If you want to read a skewed version of not the entire subject, then read Mr. Ferguson's books. One should note that just not anyone can get published in the literary industry unless you have the blessing of the very people you are exposing. In noting that, this book could be more looked at as \\"A Robber Barons' Guide to the Galaxy in how we snookered the world\\" with Niall Ferguson as the guy running the spotlight who keeps flicking that light onto other areas.    The current financial crisis is an attack on the United States proper which was engineered out of the central banks of Europe. If one bothers notice, France was the banking house which set off the same shock waves in housing and derivatives collapse.  There are no coincidences in this as it is all staged just as Warren Buffett was bragging about over 30 billion in profits which came out of people loosing money in their 401K's until he was exposed and then the headlines were planted, \\"Poor Warren his stocks are falling too\\".  Amazing how over 100 billion in a company, a billion for each of his children in a trust which can not be taxed and being a billionaire makes one poor when you have the president elect's political ear with all the other financial titans who are profiting off of all of this.    Mr. Ferguson's credentials mean nothing as he is no Victor Davis Hanson at Hoover. Mr. Ferguson is the Dinesh D'Souza of fellows in writing a great deal in things he explores from other people's work.  No one is pointing out in this the devaluation, the constriction of the economy, the way money is being flushed out of the Stock Market so the financial houses can sweep it up or leave savings accounts with devalued dollars nor are they pointing out all of this just did not happen.  Iceland was the control to see the effects and is imploding. England will be the next implosion with America the final implosion leaving the central Europeans in financial control while looking to Chinese and Indian slave labor or military fodder backed by Russian oil and arms.    The great minds have noted a Eurasian world war is coming and what is happening in this attack upon the United States happened during Lincoln's era, happened during the 30's and again in the 70's. What is brewing now is a shift from this economic warfare for global superpower to a world war in which Eurasia implodes.  Mr. Ferguson not taking the entire picture into account in how this is a direct attack upon Anglo American finance, assisted by many traitors to their own nations highlights his book is either inept or the only reason his book was manufactured just in time to herd the masses into thinking it is all just a typical event is but propaganda from the very people behind this financial manipulation.    I would not purchase this book. I would instead invest the money into something sound that the financial titans can not get their hands on.    There is an even older lesson that is free in economics:    Stay out of debt. Invest in things which can not blow away and always make certain you have your own home paid for.    Follow that advice in what is coming or read someone like Mr. Celente published online who has been predicting quite accurately the economic problems and you will be farther ahead than knowing what Mr. Ferguson is selling.    May God keep us in the times ahead. Amen
B000UOOT1W|3.0|Just what we need. Another essential, ultimate, best of Santana album featuring, you guessed it, Black Magic Woman and Evil Ways. You're better off buying a few well-chosen Santana albums based on your musical preference. If you like the popular hit songs, buy the first self-titled album, Abraxas, Moonflower and Zebop. If you like the more ambitious instrumental stuff, pick up Caravanserai, Welcome, Love, Devotion and Surrender and the live album Lotus, all from the '70s, arguably Carlos' most creative period.
B001EN71DG|1.0|Pros: The box is attractive.  Cons: You probably already own these several times over.    To those defenders and 5-star reviewers, bear in mind this is a product review, not a film review.  I'd be first in line for the Blu-ray or even and remastered (non-SE) DVD editions.

1401203078|3.0|This did not live up to the high standard set by the previous 2 volumes in the series. In fact, it doesn't seem like Alan Moore even tried very hard.  This is not so much a story as it is a bunch of loosely connected ephemera that was probably a lot of fun to create.    Don't get me wrong - there are some real gems in here. Short stories that are more or less self-contained which will delight anyone familiar with literature of the 1920's and '30's (the crossover of P.G. Wodehouse and H.P. Lovecraft was brilliant). It's not a worthless volume, just not much of a plot overall and it is in no way a satisfying sequel to the second volume.

B001ACH4DS|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Analog Heart, which should be released as it is phenomenal. David was in control of his music then, which made the record completely his and showed his originality and talent.  This debut since his AI win is great! While there are a few songs that took a few listens to really  like, the standouts are Permanent, Declaration, and Life on The Moon. Overall, a really awesome record, with multiple hits to come.  I'm hoping that he will be given more latitude on his next to rival even Analog Heart!

B001GV09FS|1.0|Decca Broadway has completely missed the mark on this \\"deluxe\\" release!  Most people I know are interested in the Mamma Mia Deluxe Edition soundtrack only because they thought the new CD would contain the songs that were missing from the original release, namely \\"Chiquititta,\\" \\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do,\\" and \\"Waterloo.\\"  Well folks, put your wallets and pocketbooks away, because the CD-portion of this set is identical to the original release right down to the track order and the DVD is skimpy to put it mildly... most of which will probably end up as bonus features on the DVD anyway!  In short, save your money for the DVD release and be sure to write Decca Records asking them what the heck happened to the missing songs from the movie!

I believed the press release that stated this is from the \\"first generation reels, and never sounded better.\\"  What a bunch of LIES!  I still can't get over that they did this to their fans. Money beats soul every time, as a great poet once said. The Doors now have to win back my (and all fans )trust and respect.     In my opinion, the only way for them to save face and make it up to their fans is to obtain the original master recordings from Peter Abram for official release.   Samples of the master recording can be found at the Wikipedia page \\"Live at the Matrix 1967.\\"   If you are shocked by what you hear, let your opinion be known!      [...]

0517223546|5.0|As a fan of James A. Michener's historical fiction novels, a friend recommended \\"Sarum\\" to me.  Since I always wanted to understand how England's history developed, this novel was received favorably.<br /><br />I found Rutherfurd's writing to be just as much compelling as Michener.  In fact, he tells a wonderful story with rich characters without bogging down the reader in excessive historical detail (as Michener sometimes is prone to do).  I found this novel to be a real page-turner, and although it is over a thousand pages long, it is really a fast read, as the story-line is so interesting.  One learns a lot of history along the way as well. It is very well written and offers a capsulization in chapters by era of the island's rich history.<br /><br />If you enjoy history, but don't like dry historical textbooks, try this book on the history of Salsibury, England.  It is a wonderfully interesting book and you will remember the distictive characters for years to come. Thge chapter on Stonehenge is worth the price alone.<br /><br />Welcome to the world of historical fiction Mr. Rutherfurd!  I will look forward to reading your other works as well.<br /><br />Jim Koenig
B000MXPE7O|3.0|This was an engrossing, if dry, film for those who like Le Carre novels and the Alec Guiness-starred movies based on them. But it's not clear from either the product description  or the reviews if a) there's any director or actor commentaries on the film; b) any making-of featurettes; or c) any documenatries about the real CIA or historical figures, such as James Angleton, upon whom the movie is based.              Since there's no mention of any of that in the product description, I assume there's no commentary track or other features. Is that correct?
B001LMRCP2|5.0|so supposedly these are the tracks that didn't make the cut for viva la vida...  In my opinion they should have been included!  The 6 new tracks are all very good, life in technicolor II is especially interesting after listening to that song instrumental for the past few months to hear Chris' voice chime in is a little different :)

Holiday Inn had its premiere at the New York Paramount Theatre in August 1942. It was a runaway success both in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, proving to be the highest grossing film musical up to that time --- The big song had been expected to be \\"BE CAREFUL, IT'S MY HEART\\" --- While that song did very well, it was \\"WHITE CHRISTMAS\\" that topped the charts in October 1942 and stayed there for eleven weeks.<br /><br />Story line and plot, In the first of two films Crosby and Astaire did together the other being \\"Blue Skies\\" (1946), the characters are remarkably the same --- Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire) is the elegant and charming show business professional who's ambitious for success --- Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby) is the talented, but lazy partner who just wants a life of ease and comfort and not to work more than he has to --- Small wonder that their double act broke up --- But now enter a complication --- They both get interested in the same girl who in this film is Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) --- Plus Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale), who becomes Fred's dancing partner with some wonderful routines in fine fashion.<br /><br />\\"BE CAREFUL IT'S MY HEART\\", the Valentine's Day song, sung by Crosby and danced to by Astaire and Reynolds --- Fred Astaire gave a tour de force performance, singing, and, of course, dancing his way through this delightful piece in rare form --- It is said that he worked so hard during rehearsals that he wasted away some 25 pounds by the time he filmed the firecracker number --- He might just as well have been weightless, because he defies gravity with his every move.<br /><br />Under the production staff of:<br />Mark Sandrich - Director / Producer<br />Claude Binyon - Screenwriter<br />Elmer Rice - Screenwriter<br />Dave Abel - Cinematographer<br />Irving Berlin - Composer (Music Score)<br />Robert Emmett Dolan - Musical Direction/Supervision / Composer (Music Score)<br />Ellsworth Hoagland - Editor<br />Hans Dreier - Production Designer<br />Roland Anderson - Art Director<br />Edith Head - Costume Designer<br />Wally Westmore - Makeup<br />Charles C.

0440243661|4.0|In Bad Luck And Trouble, Jack Reacher gets a coded message for help, from a member of his old army unit. A member of the old unit has been found dead in the desert, and a number of others seem to be missing.<br /><br />This story varies slightly from other Reacher novels, as Reacher is working against the bad guys, with the help of a few of his former colleagues, and not by himself.<br /><br />I found Reacher's army colleague's interesting, and I was rooting for them all the way, even though we do not learn too much about their characters, or past, other than there were all once very close. It was good to see Reacher's character working with other people, though, in searching for clues, making plans, and putting those plans into action.<br /><br />However, I thought the bad guys were very one-dimensional, and not really fleshed out, at all. For me, this made the ending something of an anti-climax. Overall, though, an enjoyable read, as always, but not the best in the series.
B0012GN404|5.0|...because she makes this album worthwhile..as expected. While it is interesting to hear the early little folky sounds of BBHC it is even more interesting to hear Janis Joplin in her early BBHC days.<br />This album was the first release for Big Brother from a failing record company called Mainstream. The album's producer Bob Shad was a 'scout' of sorts at concerts and shows in San Fransisco or anywhere he thought he might find the almighty dollar. Well we can sit and listen and be thankful for Mr. Shad's capitalism. This is an awesome little buncha tunes.<br />This album was produced and recorded in a studio with people who were reportedly not used to hearing the loud freak-out sounds of BBHC so this is not as big sounding as Cheap Thrills. It IS however a great trip back in time and it sounds more like Janis does folk rock rather than the usual trip-out and boogie kind of stuff. ALL the songs are great but its Janis that makes them great. Her own songwriting comes to life here and even though the band werent allowed to record at volume levels that suited them- this is NO cheap bargain bin disc. (by the way an original vinyl copy of this album is worth a pretty penny and is a GEM for collectors and fans alike)<br /><br />Its a young vibrant Janis doing great tunes with an underground feel. I bought this a long time ago and I have enjoyed it more than I can say here. Its a glimpse into a youthful, innocence that a lot of people dont see or hear very often with typical Janis stuff.<br /><br />STANDOUT TRACKS (in my opinion) ARE:<br /><br />*Easy Rider<br />*Call On Me<br />*Intruder (great lyrics by Janis herself here)<br /><br />Extra tracks were added to this later and those CDs are still very available.<br />This version of Bye Bye Baby is heard on Janis' Greatest Hits album/CD. Some of these songs on this album have double tracked vocals and it makes Janis' voice stand out and brighten the songs.<br /><br />Even tho' BBHC were NOT the best band in the world- this album/CD makes you love Janis even more. Its Janis in her youth- and as I said before- its the sound of innocence and playfulness that makes this so special.er youth- and as I said before- its the sound of innocence and playfulness that makes this so special.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|The new Indy film seems to continue all the elements that made the first three Indy films so enjoyable. In many respects, it recaptures the fun and magic of the very first Indy movie. There was even a brief glimpse of the Ark of the Covenent during the brawling fight in the Warehouse at Area 51. I hope they do, as rumored, go ahead and make yet another film in the series. Maybe next time they can use actual aliens as the bad guys. Indiana Jones Vs. Gort?
B001GQACGO|1.0|Solange's album is 1000% better. If SONY was looking to cross her over more than she already is they may succeed but have left urban listeners behind completely!
B000FA57US|4.0|HALLOWEEN V: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS is not the best of the Halloween saga sequels, but it's not the worst either although HALLOWEEN 5 had some bizarre twist & turns in this movie that didn't make sense that were also unsatisfactory as well along with the fact that this films on-screen titles don't even display \\"The Revenge of Michael Myers\\" subtitle which was used in all of the promotional materials such as TV spots, theatrical trailers, and merchandise.<br /><br />For instance, they showed a guy with a hat wearing a black trench coat & some boots not explaning to us who or what he is or what he has to do with the movie or with Michael Myers, but for some reason they had shown that mystery man shoot up the police station and to free The Shape leaving us another cliffhanger at the end, just like they did in HALLOWEEN 4:THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS, except I don't think HALLOWEEN V was as good as HALLOWEEN IV or even the first 2 Halloweens for that matter either, which reminds me that HALLOWEEN 5 came out in the movie theatres the same year A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART 5: THE DREAM CHILD and FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 8: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN were released in the movie theatres, since FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART VIII and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART V were both released in the Summer of 1989 shortly before HALLOWEEN V was released in the Fall of 1989.<br /><br />HALLOWEEN V: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS  also begins with a recap of HALLOWEEN IV: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS after Michael Myers(Don Shanks)falls down in a mine shaft & stumbles into a nearby river flow & becomes comatose for a year, but you can tell this sequel had a different guy playing The Shape and was wearing a different mask from its predecessor due to George Wilbur who played Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN 4 didn't express interest in returning to play The Shape since Wilbur had to wear hockey pads to appear having a bigger build, unlike Shanks who already had a larger build, but Wilbur returned to play TheShape again in HALLOWEEN VI: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS in the Fall of 1995.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Jamie's sister Rachel(Ellie Cornell) dies off in this sequel while Michael awakens again from another coma on Halloween Eve of 1989 to stalk his psychologically traumatized niece Jamie(Danielle Harris)again who is now committed to a psychiatric ward while Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance) gets hot on Michael's trail again to stop and kill Michael once and for all again after so many failed attempts, except this time Dr. Loomis gets Haddonfield Sheriff Meeker(Beau Starr)to help him attempt to stop Michael for a second time in HALLOWEEN V, even though Chief Sheriff ends up dying off at the end this time.<br /><br />Meanwhile Michael goes on another killing rampage in the sleepy town of Haddonfield, Illinois stalking Rachel's friends Tina(Wendy Kaplan), Samantha(Tamara Glynn), Spitz(Matthew Walker)and Tina's boyfriend Mike(Jonathan Chapin).
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones on this album does what music is supposed to do, cut out the world and just listen to her voice, her words and her music. \\"Feels Like Home\\" gives me the feeling of being at home in comfort and not wanting to leave. I will listen to this album over and over and keep it forever high on my list of most favorites.
B001GM28HO|1.0|Sorry... I think so many other people sound just like her, the electro stuff has been done before, and others have done it better, She is the last in line of  performers with this sound and look.     The music is a c, and i guess this why i have never ever herd of her or her music.. until she started riding a famous person's coat tail.    ___ COPIED CHRISTINA DO YOUR RESEARCH PEOPLE!!! CAN NOT FOOL HER FANS!!!!
B000002IOJ|5.0|&#34;Practice What You Preach&#34; is definitely one of Testament's best albums, and a true 80's thrash metal classic as well. While Testament's first two releases &#34;The Legacy&#34; from 1987 and &#34;The New Order&#34; from 1988 were both straight up headbanging thrash classics and they're both among some of my favorite 80's thrash albums, but &#34;Practice What You Preach&#34; (which was released in 1989) is more melodic and better production wise, but it still thrashes and dashes everything in it's path from start to finish, and that's exactly how a thrash metal album is supposed to sound. Lead shredder Alex Skolnick really steals the show here, I mean his solos are simply fantastic and well complexed, they'll just tear your bare flesh off and have you air guitarring like crazy. He is definitely one of the most underrated, yet respected and gifted lead guitarists not just in the thrash metal subgenre, but in METAL period. Eric Peterson is a very underrated rhythm guitarist, and an excellent one at that, as he provides great heavy riffing as well. Greg Christian's bass lines are just sick, audible, and pulse pounding throughout here. Louie Clemente's drumming is fast, loud, energetic, and heavily pounding, and last but certainly not least, singer Chuck Billy delivers an awesome non stop performance on vocals. One minute he can sound aggressive and the next he can be melodic at times as well. Chuck is definitely one of thrash metal's best singers and one of my favorites as well.<br /><br />As far as the songs go, well let's take a look at some of the favorites on here.<br /><br />The opening title track &#34;Practice What You Preach&#34; is one of Testament's best songs ever, as well as one of the best songs on here. It features thrashy chugging riffs, loud, thumping drum beats, great vocals from Chuck, and of course an excellent lengthy, wailing solo from Alex. Another heavy favorite of mine on here track six &#34;Greenhouse Effect&#34; is another one of Testament's most popular songs and their most lyrically accomplished song as well which of course is highlighted by more heavy chugging riffage, great vocals from Chuck, and of course another wicked solo by Alex. The verses and choruses in this song are awesome as well. &#34;Perilous Nation&#34; is another favorite that features more great perfectly executed soloing and of course we have some great fast, pounding drum work from Louie. Track four &#34;Time is Coming&#34; is highlighted by more thrashy chugging riffs, and excellent thrashing tempos in the drums, and another shredding solo to boot. Track five &#34;Blessed in Contempt&#34; is a wicked in your face thrasher that features fast, savage, hammering drums from Louie, monster, thrashing riffs, energetic vocal work, and of course more great soloing as well. &#34;Sins of Omission&#34; is another favorite of mine that is highlighted by catchy, blowtorch riffing, and an excellently executed complexed yet crazy shredding solo from Alex that has several different parts to it which make it sound excellent of course. &#34;Nightmare (Coming Back to You)&#34; is a short but sweet catchy headbanger while the longest song on PWYP is none other than track eight &#34;The Ballad&#34; (which clocks in at 6:03) which of course starts out as a nice ballad with some nice acoustic plucking including an acoustic solo all in the beginning, but as the song goes on, it builds up momentum, and then around the 3:45 mark, the song turns into an all out thrash raid with pounding, straight ahead drumming, and thrashing riffage, and there's also another wailing, soaring solo to boot. For the entire song list, please read on.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. Practice What You Preach (4:54) - 5/5<br />2. Perilous Nation (5:51) - 5/5<br />3. Envy Life (4:17) - 5/5<br />4. Time is Coming (5:26) - 5/5<br />5. Blessed in Contempt (4:14) - 5/5<br />6. Greenhouse Effect (4:53) - 5/5<br />7. Sins of Omission (5:00) - 5/5<br />8. The Ballad (6:03) - 5/5<br />9. Nightmare (Coming Back to You) (2:20) - 5/5<br />10. Confusion Fusion (instrumental) (3:07) - 5/5<br /><br />Overall, this album is simply to put another classic headbanging thrash metal gem from these Bay Area thrash masters. True, Testament may not have invented thrash, but they've sure mastered it, and this album is indeed proof. So if you're a fan of Testament, thrash metal, bay area thrash, or just heavy metal period, then by all means, you must buy this album TESTAMENT RULES!!usion (instrumental) (3:07) - 5/5  Overall, this album is simply to put another classic headbanging thrash metal gem from these Bay Area thrash masters.

B001CLG6RC|5.0|It's been a while since new sounds have come from Enigma and the wait was worth it. It has some new things like a little more in deep tones. Great sounds. Great ear candy.
B000002U82|5.0|Anyone who gives this cd anything less than 5 stars is an idiot and your village does'nt want you back. This music collection is so unique that it has held it's popularity from generation to generation. (The only true test of greatness). This particular example of creative prog rock puts Pink Floyd up there in rarified air with all the heavyweights, like Mozart,Beethoven,and Tchaikovsky. Great music is intellectual , and that is why some people don't get it. The majority of people are looking for a cd chocked full of little 4 minute ditties because they have the attention span of a knat. Dark Side Of The Moon is meant to be enjoyed over an expanded period of time. You put DSOTM on and you light some incense, dim the lights, and then you do something that really takes dicipline, YOU LISTEN! Even after reading this some people won't get it, because they are afraid to leave the shallow end of the pool. So go ahead and continue to drink budweiser, watch t.v., listen to country music, and vote republican. Those of us with a brain will continue to enjoy Pink Floyd's best work- Dark Side Of The Moon!!!!

You can build a tertific physique if you would follow sensible routines buy real world authors- Mark rippetoe, stuart mcrobert, mike mentzer, ellinton darden. Please heed this advice.

031606792X|3.0|The book, Breaking Dawn, was a slow read, but it had its moments. Jacab was the best part of this book. I think Stephenie Meyer raced through this book in writing it; but it turn out to be an ok read.  Although it lacked the captivating quality of New Moon and Eclipse, it did, in the end, have a good ending; boy and girl live happily ever after.
1401216676|5.0|One of the best Batman stories ever, followed by the hand of one of the masters in comic book art. The best drawings of Batman I've seen. Great quality of this hardcover, too.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Gossip in the Grain is a great CD.  The music is both relaxing and energizing.  La Montagne's voice is one of kind.  His lyrics are smart, witty, sad, sharp, lyrical, and pertinent.  Everyone I've played the CD for has really enjoyed it even though none of them had ever heard of La Montagne before.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Finally, after more than a decade a taste of the old Metallica. Anyone who is from the old needs to pick up this album. Right from the start it lures you in and doesn't let you go without the impact. \\"It's about time boys, welcome back!!\\"
6305718954|5.0|In French we say \\"Dieu est amour\\" (God is love) and we all understand that what \\"is\\" (reality), is important.  I think the movie addresses this issue in a very interesting way.  I was concerned by the way the universal church is portrayed, for one must never forget that Jesus said to Peter, \\"Peter you are the rock and upon this rock I will build the church\\" etc... The church is the house of God and God is love (Dieu est amour).
B001F7MSFW|5.0|The Golden Army - an army made to keep humanity in check because humanity has a problem with consuming everything around it. Of elvish thought and goblin design, it has the power to do things that only the desperate - or a madman - would want. The elvish kind figure that out, split their toy up, and let the army rust. Unfortunately for humanity, rust is an arbitrary word and the Golden Army is something that never stopped being a threat. And when the powerplay begins to emerge, the BPRD are the only ones around that have the skills to stop it.<br /><br />When I heard what the source material for the movie was, I knew the director/ Migola knew what they were doing BUT it frightened me a bit. I say that because Hellboy II was creatively based on a novelization between Christopher Golden and Mike Mignola and is not truly reflective of Hellboy. It had a good idea and some good creature-features but, in the end, the book was a mild disappointment. Fast-forward to the book and you saw what a good director could do with something that needed a golden (pardon the pun) touch. The toothfairies, Wink, the elemental, the goblin, the angel (if you want to understand that little beastie and what it says more, check out the backstory to Anung Un Rama and the way the beast was created. This takes place in a short story and highlights some lovely little things that a person should see for themselves to truly understand everything) and all the characters in-between. Happily, the casting has always been good, the direction is fabulous, and Hellboy is portrayed the way Hellboy should be portrayed.<br />This means that he thinks with his fist, has a gun the size of a small man, and is not really filled with a little thing called respect.<br /><br />As far as what the movie offered, let me just say that it had a bit of everything. The action was quite good, the human (and I use human loosely) elements of the tale were fantastic, and the movie explored some more of what the BRPD is. They allowed viewers shapshots into the each person, into their likes and their wants, and they added a new character that translated oddly from book-to-movie but still translated well as a character. Ron is a perfect Hellboy, too, and he lets this shine in this new installment. In the part with the elemental you can see how much he is impacted, and in the fights with specific beings you can tell he doesn't want to hurt them. He wants to be liked by everyone and understands the plight of the things that \\"threaten\\" humanity. Del Toro adding that in made in amazing because that is one of Hellboy's things in the books - enough so that the BPRD and he really have some major problems.<br /><br />If you like Hellboy and you want a movie on the subject, this is good work. I know there have been a lot of complaints here and there about certain aspects of the film, but Hellboy is a solid follow-up and fans of the novels/ the first movie will enjoy themselves. If you pay extra attention to the details involved you will find all sorts of good stuff hidden in the backdrop, allowing a peek at what Anung Un Rama is struggling with as a demon-made-human by his own choices. You can also see potential elements that could have ramifications for the world and everyone inhabiting it - I liked that a lot as well. Combine that with a LOT of extra (we even get a comic that moves about to keep the ADD watchers in us sated), and you have a second helping that explores what the first movie could only build.<br />Highly beloved.shots into the each person, into their likes and their wants, and they added a new character that translated oddly from book-to-movie but still translated well as a character.

0375826726|5.0|I love this series of books, they're always great reading.  The movie Eragon (the first book) didn't do the book justice, so if you've never read it because of the movie don't hesitate, I highly recommend reading the book Eragon.  The author uses a made-up language, which just like any foreign language can be hard to pronounce and understand, so he puts pronunciations and meanings in the back.  It makes it much more enjoyable reading.  I was really excited to find out that there will be one more book for this series.  I can't wait to read it.  Thanks Christopher Paolini, keep writing.
B00006AVRK|5.0|There are no flaws in this series based on the splendid stories of P.G. Wodehouse.  The setting and backgrounds are beautiful and the writing is excellent, especially in the episodes which were drawn from multiple stories.  The true masterpiece of this series is the acting of the two lead characters.  Stephen Fry's work has flown under the radar in every instance and his portrayal of Jeeves ranks with the great comedy character depictions.  Hugh Laurie is equally brilliant.  Those who only know him as House seriously need to watch him as Bertie Wooster.  After that they should check him out in Blackadder and A Bit of Fry and Laurie.  I can't watch him as House because it is such a step down from the brilliance of his performance as Wooster.  I also can't take the American accent, it doesn't do him justice in his ability to steep any sentence with layers of nuance.

0711986746|3.0|My intrigue for Freddie lead me to buy this book. I'm fascinated with his singing and showman abilities, and wanted to know on a personal level his more personal life. This book is more an account of his music and when and where it was made, which I really did not care much about, and took up much of the book. There is some little tid bits of information of how he felt and thought, but not many unknown personal stories. Much of what was written about him I had already learned from you tube videos. So I'm giving this account a 3 star which if possible I would probably give a 2 1/2 star.
B001C08RHA|4.0|The movie is fun to watch.  It's not too serious but it isn't campy either.  The effects were top notch and the Robert plays a great Stark in my opinion.  The only thing I sort of dislike is the ending, the bit after the credits.  It reminds me of all that crossover nonsense that happens in the comic books which really kills comic books for me.  Plus I find Samuel a tough actor to like now a days.  But that's just me.
B001I8A76A|3.0|I like Pink alot.  I think she has an incredible voice.  A few tracks into this disc all I could think was that I'd be so glad when her next one comes out.  It seems she needed to make this disc as part of a personal healing process.  I've always appreciated her spunk and her sass, and this has it.  This 'divorce' album just wasn't for me.
6303257801|5.0|The Turner 1989 colorized edition of RKO's KING KONG (1933) is skillfully rendered. One thing that's more apparent than ever with this new version is the beauty of Fay Wray, all natural save for a blonde Max Factor wig.<br /><br />Color schemes for the jungle sequences have an almost comic book quality-- misty orange skies prevail; they make an already frightening part of the story that much more ominous.<br /><br />Colorizing fails, as it often does, in crowd scenes-- here the many dozens of native villagers are broad-brushed in a fashion typical of early colorization. On the other hand, certain other aspects were quite naturalistic: torch fire had a proper tint, with the tops of flames appearing a bit deeper than the rest, also, wafting cigarette smoke doesn't interact with colors beyond-- the slight obscuration it causes appears most normal.<br /><br />Skin tones are good, background hues in man-made settings appropriate. The tints of the climactic skyscraper scene include well-defined cityscape and sky backdrops. On a 1 to 10 scale, I'd rate the enhancements a 7. The movie itself remains to my mind a solid 10.<br /><br />KONG TRIVIA--<br />The pilot and machine gunner that kill the giant ape are the film's director, Merian C. Cooper and producer, Ernest B. Schoedsack.<br /><br />The heavy-set native woman who sees Kong at her window is Etta McDaniel, Hattie's sister.<br /><br />The Great Wall was originally used in Cecil B. DeMille's silent epic, THE KING OF KINGS (1927).<br /><br />Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe has a cameo as a native dancer.<br /><br />Jean Harlow refused the lead in this picture.<br /><br />The 60th Anniversary edition of the b&w KING KONG includes a documentary.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|The DVD is amazing and will keep it for posterity. my sellers turn around was amazing!!!
B001GJOL22|5.0|I saw this tour in the Quad cities ( i-wireless Center also known as The Mark.) in may 2008. This was totally different sounding than my home theater and dvd.  The concert was much louder and had overblown bass especially at the beginning of Subdivisions. God it went through my body and all.  The drum solo was also loud and seemed shorter than the concert dvd.  The cymbels and snare and all pads blended together and really sounded bad.  The Dvd concert drum solo was awsome.  It was much different than the previous concert dvds (Rush in Rio and R30).  What I enjoyed most about this concert tour is that they played Witch Hunt and YYZ and Red Barchetta from one of their most popular album.  Would have liked if they played Time Stand Still, But  perhaps another time.  The Sound of the concert Recording was excellent as was the picture.  I remember the green lasers at the live concert I attended and they were mesmerising.  No T.V. or Dvd can reproduce the real thing so I'll leave that at that.  I take my hat off to those reviewers who reviewed this dvd before its release and gave it 5 stars.  It is a 5 star dvd Blu-ray or regular ray.  I Feel the disc was well Mixed (soundwise)  Alex's Guitar was probably a little louder than the drums and Geddy's voice was about right.  They could have boosted the drums a little.  They seemed a little louder on Neil's solo.  The crowed noise was perfect for me.  Not covered up at all.  I know that some people thought the crowd noise was rediculously overbering in the Rio dvd.  In a live concert you do hear the crowdnoise.  Definitely worth buying.  P.S. I forgot to mention that Geddy did admit to the crowd after the first set that they had chicken and there was plenty of it cooking on stage.  But the guy who was messing with the rotisseree was a regular Joe at the concert I attended.  Also the guy sitting in front of me had a copy of the set list of the show and at  the bottom it say's Version 3.  I practically begged him if I could buy it off him and he gave it to me.  What a night it was.
B001B67VR2|4.0|OK, the other two reviewers have a bone to pick with Amazon, Pepsi points and other things completely unrelated to Rihanna's music.  If you like Rihanna, this is an excellent album.  Not many to choose from yet, being a young artist.  But, IMHO this is a better album than her first \\"Music of the Sun\\", which is not an insult of her debut either.  I almost gave this 5 stars just to counter the crappy, unrealistic and unrelated reviews provided by the other two people here.... but I resisted.  This really is a 4 star album, with solid music, vocals, and production.  if you've heard of and like Rihanna, you'll like Good Girl Gone Bad.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This album is awesome! David Cook is so talented, and this album was everything I hoped for and more. All of the songs are great, and David did an excellent job co-writing the lyrics. Can't wait for his CDs in the future!
B00008977N|5.0|Secret World is the Best Live Show I can imagine! The mix of excellent impassioned songs, great sound, great stage presence of all the band- they were all having fun! plus the cool stage presentation make this the best concert!!  When we play this dvd we all end up \\"dancing in the aisles\\". The girl singer- Paula- mixes so well w/gabriel and has one of the best voices ever. I've been to a decent amount of shows and this has to be the best- from the living room. It goes so well with a cranking sound system and big screen!  It's interesting because I had the secret world live cd for years and it was amongst my favorites. I was thrilled to discover the dvd and the couple of \\"dud\\" songs on the cd that I used to skip over have some pretty cool stage theatrics in the dvd that make them riveting.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|AWESOME BUL-RAY HI DEF QUALITY MOVIE WHICH IS MUCH BETTER THEN 2003 HULK MOVIE. EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE, A MUST OWN FOR ANY HULK FAN.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I just finished my first workout with this dvd and wow! I work out once a week in an advanced yoga class with lots of plank holds, push ups, and lung type exercises and thought this dvd would be easy/medium for me.  Boy, was I wrong. I just did the first class a few hours ago and my arms are sore already. (I did just do another bootcamp video yesterday and I am sore from that too.) Jillian kicked my butt and I'm ready to go back for more!
0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick is an utterly delightful read for children and adults will enjoy it as much as the kids do.  Since the graphic novel MAUS was awarded the most prestigious award several years ago, graphic novels have been much acclaimed by critics and bibliophiles as authentic literaturee, and now the excellent art of Selznick brings it into the realm of outstanding children's literature.  With a captivating and mysterious story of a young orphaned boy who lives in the walls of a train station in Paris, France, you will find this a page turner.  But you will stop many times to pour over the excellent full page drawings of this work of art.  Brian has built this fanciful story based on a real person who created some of the world's early films, Geroges Melies, and a few of Melies own drawings appear in the book also, as well as some historic art, reprinted with permission. The early days of film-making play a central part as the mystery unfolds, and of course, everyone lives happily ever after.  This is a treasure of a book for the family!  And you'll want to order more by Brian Selznick who has many to his credit.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|(3 & 1/2 stars) This new EP is a nice companion piece to Viva La Vida, containing some very good songs of its own.  Nothing ultra-amazing, certainly nothing to approach V-La-V's glorious title track, but still some material worth exploring.  In fact three of the eight songs are variations of tunes from the full album, a more rocking \\"Life in Technicolor ii,\\" an alternate mix of \\"Lovers in Japan,\\" and \\"Lost+.\\"  The latter is the weakest of the three \\"Lost\\" versions on a recent 4-song download, but the other two V-L-V revisits are interesting enough.  Of the new tunes, I really liked \\"Postcards from Far Away,\\" a short but lovely, classical-sounding piano instrumental, and \\"Glass of Water.\\"  The EP's closing number, \\"Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground\\" is a relatively disposable folkish tune.  Overall, though, I appreciate the additional material supplementing Viva La Vida.
B001GQACGE|2.0|I've always loved Beyonce from Destiny's Child to her album B-day.  On her Sasha Fierce album it seems like she's trying to change her sound... a little more Country Rock and Popish.  Not her normal modernized old school sound.  The song \\"Radio\\" will definitely make it big but it sounds like something Rihanna would sing to.  Too many slow songs on this album.  Hopefully we'll get the old B back on her next album.  She's still extraordinarily beautiful and her voice is more amazing than ever.  Just don't care for the producing much on this album.
B001BKG9SK|4.0|David Gilmour plays like no other , and you will enjoy his guitarlicks.I would like to give this 5 stars , but for that he had to play even more Floydsongs...If you can buy the 4disc-set , you have a great deal.It is very cheap for a set with 2 cd's and 2 excellent dvd's.One more thing : this concert is recorded with HD-cameras and it shows!
B00003CXCT|5.0|For Star Wars aficionados.  It has the latest special effect additions and better resolution than the same period VHS tapes.  Interesting bonus disk.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|[[ASIN:1603780904 Metallica - Death Magnetic (Tab)]]  This new Metallica CD is AWESOME! It totally rocks! I would recommend this CD to any and all Metallica fans.
B001GQACGO|5.0|This is some of Beyonce's best work. As an artist she has grown and is learning to venture out and try new sounds.    My Personal Favorites:  Halo- a nice emotional well written ballad. Has a Leona Lewis meets Rihanna feel to it but Beyonce definitely nails this one.  Hello- has a catchy melodic hook and good lyrics  Sweet Dreams- upbeat tempo with an addictive hook  Single Ladies- enough said  Scared of Lonely- well song ballad with a nice musical background  Radio- very playful fun song. Nice for playing while driving.  Disappear- shows the more acoustic side of Beyonce and has good lyrics
B001E1GXPA|5.0|Not having ever heard Ember to Inferno, I can only compare this to Ascendancy and The Crusade.  In Shogun,Trivium returns to the screams which pulled me in, but does not leave out the harmony and vocalization which made The Crusade a great record. There are a few instances where, within a track, the beat changes oddly, and the album varies oddly from track to track a bit, too.  But the content easily rivals that of previous albums while not sounding like the same old music.    I would actually give it 4.5/5 stars, but, alas, I cannot.
0307341550|4.0|Have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers that it was difficult to believe this was a first novel.  The writing was wonderfully vivid and dead-on, and the characters, believable and haunting. I was sucked right into the story from page one, and though I'm normally not drawn to such dark topics, I couldn't put it down. Ms. Flynn isn't afraid to show the uglier sides of life in a way that makes you at once repulsed and sympathetic.  With \\"Sharp Objects\\" she has written an incredibly perceptive book and I can't wait to read her others!
B000000OA6|4.0|1991 was a year of change in the music industry. Nirvana released the essential 'Nevermind.' Guns N' Roses released the 'Use Your Illusion' series that year. And who could forget U2's classic 'Achtung Baby'?    But the real surprise in 1991 was Queen's 'Innuendo.' Freddie Mercury, a sick and dying man when this was recorded, sounds better than ever, and Brian May's guitar is easily at it's best since, say 'Sheer Heart Attack' or 'News Of The World.'    Another pleasant surprise was Queen's return to heavy metal. The title track and 'Headlong' are really great early '90s heavy metal songs, and Mercury proves he still has the vocal range to sing metal -- and effectively.    'Innuendo' features two great, showstopping ballads, 'The Show Must Go On' and one of my personal favorites, 'These Are The Days Of Our Lives.' Mercury's voice is undescribable, it's just so great.    My personal favorite here is perhaps 'I'm Going Slightly Mad.' Mercury shows his bold, operatic range, and it's easily one of the greatest, most dramatic performances Queen ever did.    After 'Innuendo' was released, Mercury stepped in the studio to make a batch of final recordings that would later round up the 1995 album 'Made In Heaven.'    On November 23, 1991, Freddie Mercury announced he had AIDs. A day later, November 24, 1991, Mercury was dead at the age of 45. Elton John, David Bowie and the rest of Queen (May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor) all attended his funeral. When Mercury died, the music world truly lost one of it's greatest vocalists.    Overall, if you haven't already, listen to 'Innuendo.' It's not their best, but it's certainly one of their best. Mercury's voice is as fine as it's been in years.    I highly recommend 'Innuendo' to anybody who loves Queen or even appreciates them. Mercury purists should enjoy this album too.    ENJOY!!!
B001F7MSFW|1.0|It could have been so much better. And who's stupid idea was that lame musical interlude? ( the duet )
1401300529|3.0|If you want to read a book about the Korean War, read T.R. Fehrenbach's \\"This Kind of War.\\"  If you instead want a book that is about Washington insider politics of the era, then maybe Halberstam's book is for you.  The serious military historian will not learn much from Halberstam, though it does provide one man's view of the impact Far Eastern political turmoil had on internal U.S. affairs.
0670020745|4.0|The book was very well written.  It was about a brain scientist who experinced a stroke and then wrote about it.  I really enjoyed it!
0385340567|2.0|I have enjoyed other of Child's Reacher stories but this one I should have missed.  First we go to Hope and then to Despair and Reacher keeps going back to Despair, the town.  In this story Reachers keeps fighting with the poor miserable inhabitants of this town and it is just overkill and Reacher comes off as more of a thug.  There are absolutely no surprises in this book except for how ill-conceived it is.  The Reacher character works better when he is up against tough characters, not weak ones.  The ending to me was just a, \\"Huh\\"?  Why he detonates a Depleted Uraniun/TNT mega-bomb makes no sense at all.  Maybe after 10 years of wandering Reacher needs a break.
B000OPPBEQ|1.0|I have had no problem with my high quality Blu-ray player except it will not play these discs.
B0012GMZMW|5.0|This is one of the best Journey Albums. It is by far the best album that Steve Augeri did when he was the lead singer for Journey. Their best lead singers (Steve Perry, Steve Augeri & Arnel Pineda) all have their own unique style. My two favorite songs on this album are Higher Place and To Be Alive Again. Both songs have an incredible sound, which is what you would expect when you listen to any of Journey albums. Steve, Neal, Jon, Ross & Deen are second to none. If you love Journey, like I do, you will certainly want to purchase this album. It ranks right up there with my personal favorites which are the Live Escape Album & their newest one, Revelation. I would also recommend purchasing their dvd from the Arrival tour in 2001. They have a song on it entitled Fillmore Boogie which I really wish was on a cd. It is one of the most enjoyable instrumental songs I've ever heard. You can tell that they all had a lot of fun playing this song too.
B001DPC52C|4.0|The DVD is amazing and a must-have for anyone who has never had a chance to see Within Temptation live, and a should-get for those who have (since this particular concert was special and different from their normal ones).  The cd is kind of a blow-off, though.  It is basically the first half of the concert, minus a couple songs, and is pretty much The Heart of Everything cd done live.  Still, Black Symphony is worth buying for the DVD, which has rare songs, some great duets, and behind the scenes footage.
B001GQACGE|1.0|Well she could and its called I am Sasha Fierce? What she wants to be a drag queen now? Okay she's already got the look for that.   Beyonce doesnt deliver anything new on this turd on an album with the exeption of Helo maybe. A pretty enough track though better suited for the likes of Leona Lewis.    I'd recommend that you DON'T get this album. It stinks even worse than all her previously efforts
B001GQACGO|1.0|I was so excited when I heard that Beyonce was coming out with a new album. I even was at Bestbuy a week early to purchase it only to find out that it was to come out the next following week. This album was HORRIBLE. It sounds like soft country music. What was she thinking? Dangerously In Love was here best solo album yet. I try to support the Artist I love and trust me I'm Beyonce #1 fan, but this crap made we wish I could have saved my money and downloaded it. I'm so Dissappointed, words can't even describe. Not to compare her to Jennifer Hudson's album, but those who have her's can agree that her album was way better than Beyonce's. I halfway like 1 song on disc 1 as well as 1 song on disc 2! Please don't waste your money. Save it for Keyshia Coles' album I'm sure she want let us down! Get it together Beyonce, that first disc was so dreadful, I even tried to listen to it twice to make sure I wasn't tripping, but it was still horrible. Use to be her #1 fan, now I'm not a fan!
B00003CXCQ|4.0|The over-all movie quality was superb, colors were vibrant, and the sound was clear.  Happy to have this classic in my collection now (though the discs were scratchier than anticipated, everything still plays fine so far).
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I loved this movie growing up as a kid (even though I was only born in 1988) and I still love it to this day.  Very funny and yet can scare you if you are not ready.  You will laugh, cry, scream, laugh and cry, and just scream non-stop.
B00003CXB4|3.0|I recieved this new dvd in the mail and the corner of the box was damaged.  The Dvd inside had been sliding around and there are some signs of scratches. I have not watched the dvd yet to see if has effected it.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|I remember watching this growing up.  It is a funny movie with witty comments as well as nerd jokes.  Also, not to mention \\"robots do not feel things, they run programs\\", well clearly not Johnny 5.    I bought this to show my wife where they came up with the design for WallE (the face) and she thought the movie was going to be stupid but she loved it to and has watched it several times since we got it 2 weeks ago.
1401200923|5.0|This is the climax to a great Batman story. If you've read Loeb's previous work then you'd know he's worked on stories involving Batman's early career. After reading Dark Victory this feels more or less like an indirect sequel to that story. This is definitely the same Batman, but he's far more experienced now, and much more sure of himself (until he falls in love...or does he?) Anyway. Pick up part one, and part two. You won't regret it!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I read reviews after I bought the 3-disc set on pre-order and thought to myself \\"Oh no\\".  However I am glad I bought it.    I bought it for my wife for an early Christmas present.  I am not going to spoil anything but for those that claim Disney is saying \\"fat people cause everything\\".  No, they are not.  If you look at the cut scene of pictures (will not describe them any further so I do not ruin the movie for others) it is a progression over time.  What you see on Earth in the start of the movie is caused by ALL of human kind.  People need to read into it and not just assume what they see, didn't we learn that in school?  I know I did atleast. For the person that asked if Al Gore produced the movie, at first it seemed like it huh?    As for the movie, it is fun for children and the colors make babies just stare and giggle at it. I liked the movie and it was worth buying.

0441009425|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, but in the end I just can't recommend it. The ideas are fantastic, the universe is engrossing and even the plot is entertaining and interesting. But there is not a single likable character in the story, with the occasional exception of a minor character here and there. All of the main characters, and most of the secondary characters, are not only unlikable, but they're all exactly the same: arrogant, sarcastic, monomaniacal, an joyless. In fact I would say that's the biggest flaw of Reynolds' writing: there is no joy in the characters or (rare for British writers) the writing itself. I actually cheered when any character died, because I cared so little about them.    Aside from the characters, the narrative construction is annoying, jumping endlessly between three widely-separated subplots on almost every page, and withholding vital information from the reader (even when the characters themselves learn the important information) for no point other than cheap cliffhangers at the end of each extremely brief scene. Think Dan Brown.    The core of this story is wonderful. If you're good at assembling a story from intentionally confusing storytelling style, and you can deal with endless cynicism and sarcasm, the underlying universe and plot are worth the read. But I think you'd be better served reading the synopsis on Wikipedia.    I've heard Reynolds' writing improves in some of his later books. I'll probably check one of them out and see for myself, as he does show himself to be a promising writer.    Instead of this book, however, I would recommend another far future, Einsteinian physics, big-picture first novel from a new author: the Golden Age series from John C Wright. It's far and away the best sci-fi I've read in the last decade.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|The graphics are absolutely fantastic and the story line is excellent.  I'm looking forward to the sequel already.  Bring on some of the other comic book heroes, like Green Latern, the Flash, and Green Arrow!
B001E75QGG|3.0|We enjoyed this movie but it was just more of the same.  The ending was deeply thought-provoking, but the only place in the entire movie that was so.  Great photography/cinematography, good acting, and good guy versus bad.  However, not as much fun due to the sameness of the earlier movies, except for the ending, which will challenge your intellect.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The Fall is stunning not only for it's epic visual style but also for it's intimate emotional scenes. Lee Pace and Cantinca Untaru provide the heart of the story as patients at a California hospital who become friends. Pace's character Roy spins a fascinating yarn for the young Alexandria (Untaru) as he tries to gain her trust. The scenes of the \\"bandit\\" story showcase director Tarsem's signature work with color and landscapes. All-in-all the film is delightful, with it's unexpected touches of humor and whimsy and the completely unaffected performance by Untaru.
B000002NCW|4.0|Voyager is not your momma's Celtic.  When the Celtic rage first took the music scene by storm it was refreshing.  However, within a very short time Celtic music started to get old real fast as an over abundance of the style flooded the music scene and it all started sounding the same.  Oldfield provides tastefully outstanding arrangements of the traditional music chosen for this project.   Voyager is one of Oldfield' best.  I found it refreshing and completely different from all the other Celtic albums.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Wow!  Just bought the CD, and it's incredible!  From the opening, very heavy track (incredible 'Helter Skelter' type vocals), to more layered songs, it is FAR from a typical McCartney album, including his last 2 more \\"experimental\\" albums.  This album sets Paul free from the confines of needing to write some sort of catchy tune that he would play in concert.  The total freedom allows for a very modern, experimental sound, but not heavy-handed in any way.  Just damned good!
031606792X|5.0|Ok.. I finally agree with the vast majority of reviewers about Jacob. I enjoyed his bonding with Edward, to an extend. I felt like he was overstaying his welcome-- moderately. Bella's desire for him was irritating. Hearing Jacob's perspective on his \\"Alpha\\" status first hand was interesting. But when he decided he'd fallen in love with Bella's child-- I was disgusted and took a break for about a day before I decided I wanted to know what happened. (I cheated a little.. flipping to the end. I wasn't going to continue reading if the entire last book was devoted to two parents condoning a pedophile).<br /><br />Somewhere in the last book with Bella's narration... He eased up a bit. He stopped interfering with Bella's attempts at motherhood (and seriously.. she deserved the opportunity given the fact that her pregnancy was like 100 times worse than usual....). I wanted them to kick Jacob out and keep him away. (Although.. knowing pesty Jacob.. he probably would have attempted to steal 'Nessie' and make her hate her parents or something). -- and what is up with the name Renessie anyway? Ew?<br /><br />Come page 718-- I felt like Meyer was really trying to end the series. She spilled out all the political tinges to her book. .. Letting go of family feuds by becoming friends with an enemy that never really was (kinda like racism) ... Standing up for rights or letting your rights get taken away (kinda how protests form today.. and the big debate on the news currently in politics with womens rights... gay rights).. The biblical-like story where you have a battle, there's good versus evil and some are too afraid to fight and run in fear. Anyhow... from 718 on like.. five pages, it was filled with these sorts of analogies. I get that her book was kind of like that all along-- questioning our way of thinking.. making us understand various perspectives (even when they were annoying... like overly-sensitive-way-too-apologetic Bella). Meyer made everything make sense... but I felt like she needed more time to kind of mesh this nicely into the book. Instead, I was reading page after page of nonstop lecture-format dialogue. (Not that I didn't enjoy the subject matter... It just felt rushed).<br /><br />She did a great job. I didn't mind the happy ending... although I do with they would have killed off the Volturi as opposed to anticipating getting picked off one at a time. It seems to me like the second novel where they didn't anticipate Victoria coming back to avenge her lovers death... Or Irina for that matter. Meyer left us with limitless possibilities for thinking about the \\"future\\" of the characters.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the relationship Bella had with her baby... I think I read a few reviews that said otherwise when purchasing the book. I was only upset that she was allowing Jacob to take away not only HER opportunity to bond with the child, but Edwards too. I was even kinda pissed off when she had Rosalie protecting her while pregnant... like Edward would reeeally go out of his way to hurt her. She made him miss out on the moment. And in her case.. it was only happening once. ::sigh::more time to kind of mesh this nicely into the book. Instead, I was reading page after page of nonstop lecture-format dialogue. (Not that I didn't enjoy the subject matter... It just felt rushed).    She did a great job.

I think I read a few reviews that said otherwise when purchasing the book. I was only upset that she was allowing Jacob to take away not only HER opportunity to bond with the child, but Edwards too. I was even kinda pissed off when she had Rosalie protecting her while pregnant... like Edward would reeeally go out of his way to hurt her. She made him miss out on the moment. And in her case.. it was only happening once. ::sigh::
B0019CSXAM|4.0|...it seems right to post this review at this time.  Being a latecomer to HIMYM fandom, the coming of Season 3 on DVD was very exciting for me; I'd been finished with the first 2 seasons for months by the time it arrived!  I think the show holds up well, overall, with the aforementioned \\"Slapsgiving\\" episode providing more laugh-out-loud moments for my husband and I than anything else in recent memory.  The reappearance of Robin Sparkles, the follow-up/lingering question mark of the Ted's-30th-birthday-goat-in-the-bathroom story, and of course the oft-lauded 2-minute date sequence are season highlights.  My only great disappointment was not feeling like we, the audience, got to know Stella enough to fall in love with her the way Ted did.
B001LMRCP2|5.0|Has there been a glitch in the system because these songs are worth way more than $.99 combined.  Normally you pay $0.99 per song, and this EP has 8 songs.  Not to mention, it's good.  Anyways, totally worth every cent, though I feel like Amazon could have sold it for a lot more.  Afterall, they did spend the money and time in the studio to make this EP.

B001GQO50I|1.0|First of all, its great to see the Doors release an early gig. However, its not cool that they sourced their \\"first generation from the master\\" from already circulating bootleg copies. Its not cool that they decided to release half of the Matrix shows. What happened to BMA's motto \\"new releases will be presented in their entirety and unedited\\" that gracefully adorns the front of their web page?  Its also not cool that they did not even offer to pay the original Matrix taper for his recordings. The guy has been in contact with the Doors since 2002 but they have just given him the cold shoulder. Thanks to the original taper, some sound samples of his original master copies were uploaded to the internet a week ago and sound so, So, SO much better than this junk the Doors released. Don't waste your money on this release until (hopefully) the Doors release the TRUE master copies.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|The greatest thing about Nickelback is they can Rock hard as well as sing a great love song. Id have to say my fav track on the album is Never Gonna Be Alone, but im a sucker for a catchy ballad, why this was not one of the first two Singles eludes me. Though I diddnt change the station I was a bit disapointed at the Singles they relesed and was hoping for more of Nickelbacks harder edge songs on the release, I was relived to find a few on the track list. As far as the lyric complaints they have always been about Livin the rockin Roll lifestyle. So get over it!!!I leave you with \\"you look so much better with something in your mouth.\\"
B000BBOV8U|5.0|this is a wonderful collection of the singles of mr. bryan adams, since that he start a pop rock career, his singles of soundtracks and unplugged, his single with miss tina turner, but in this collection  is  missing a great hit of around 1991-1992 that call \\"DO I HAVE TO SAY THE WORDS\\", very very beautiful, in my opinion one of the best single of mr. bryan adams.
0452289963|4.0|I think the book is an excellent way to learn how important it is for each of us to know our life's purpose. I had the wonderful opportunity to read this book during the final months of the 2008 presidential election. As I read this book and watched the election process, I understood the life affirming principles and illustrations shared in this book and made the connection with millions of people around the world who chose to know our life purpose.      The book is timeless, comforting, and allows us to remember and tap into the richness within ourselves. Fear=ego and neither is an option to the path we will follow after reading this book. Instead, I hope that millions more will read this book and share it with others. It shows us how to we can \\"change our minds, change our world\\" to discover, live and pursue our own healthy, wise and fulfilling life purpose.
B00000425L|4.0|For the price this a very good collection to own to complete your collection of the Rachmaninoff preludes. Although you will find better individual performances of the preludes from pianists such as Moiseiwitsch, Ogdon, or Cliburn, you will not find many complete sets of the preludes. Ashkenazy handles them all well, and in addition he performs the 2nd sonata. For the 2nd sonata I don't think you cant surpass Horowitz, but this set for the works is worth the low price by a one of the great pianists of our time.
0670020745|4.0|I enjoyed this book and found it very informative.  My husband suffered from an AVM also and brain bleed but he had a different procedure than surgery.  However, the commonality was that he has had to retrain his brain just like this author.  She is not the best writer in the world, as the book could have been much shorter with the same information as it seemed she kept repeating herself on certain stories.  She is an extremely smart woman and being able to relate her experience is very interesting.  An amazing story of her recovery that could have taken a different path!!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband, but I love it!  The pictures are amazing, they really can't be described.  I bought the BBC version because I love the guy's accent.  This is a must see series!
B001F290E4|5.0|This is my first Seal album - I am enjoying it so much - reminds me how much I love Ray Charles - if you are looking for soul with a touch of new and old sounds, you are going to love this CD.  This one is a hit as far as I am concerned!
0307276902|4.0|English majors may find the fragments and run-ons distracting, but Frey cultivates a unique style that is sure to provoke a reaction from even the most stoic readers.      This reader found his transformation convincing and realistically difficult.  The book clearly gives insight into living with addiction.  One wonders, though, which parts were fictionalized or sensationalized.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW MUCH MY HUSBAND AND GROWN SON LOVED THIS MOVIE--IT IS \\"NOT\\" A CHIC FLICK.  THE CAST IS PERFECT AND THE STORY IS WONDERFUL.  DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE!  I WILL WATCH IT MANY TIMES.
B000E1MTZE|2.0|It said it came with the animatrix dvd but all I got was a coupon to download it from xbox live that had expired in 2007. Should have splurged on the blue ray.
B001GQO50I|1.0|This release could have been the best of the band, unfortunately :  - sound quality is average, 4 songs are really poor and evidently bootleggs sourced  - order of tracks/shows is not the one of the show, some tracks are missing  - the master source always owned by the original taper sounds much more better (see circulating clips)  Even the sound is better for several tracks than what we have with bootleggs you would wait for a master release before buying an official release.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Who didn't cringe a bit when Sony unveiled the unsightly, boomerang controller with the PS3, oh so many years ago?  So when it was revealed that the controller was going to be the same shape & function as the DualShock 2, I let out a huge sigh of relief.  But my relief was tempered by the announcement that there was to be no 'shock' in the new wireless controller.  \\"Oh well,\\" I thought, \\"At least it still 'looks' like the dual shock.\\"  But then I heard that the reason for no 'shock' was that it wasn't compatible with the sixaxis feature.  Now I'm no electronics engineer, but I know enough to know that there are ways to counter such incompatibilities.      I thought correctly when they released the DualShock 3, Sony's next gen gamer's Excalibur.  Same awesome design that fits oh so perfectly in my hand, same game enhancing vibration function as the DS2, and now with the sixaxis control feature & it's wireless!  What more do I need to say about it?  Sure there are other after market controllers out there for less money, but why?
B00005NGAK|3.0|Had I known it was \\"Lord of The Dance\\" all over again I wouldn't have purchased the video.  Oh well, live and learn.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|I thought this one was much better than the Hulk that came out a few years ago with Eric Banna. At first I wasn't really sure what they were thinking having Edward Norton as the Hulk, but I gotta say I thought he did an awesome job! The fighting scenes were great and I really liked Liv Tyler as Betty. So, a good movie overall.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I was overwhelmed by this production of Hamlet.  Kenneth Branagh is wonderful and plays the part of Hamlet with such sensitivity and vitality - makes the unabridged lines accessible, even to people unused to Shakespeare.  Kate Winslet is excellent.  The whole cast and the scenes - especially the scenes - are staggeringly good.  The only Hamlet on film, worth watching!  Kenneth Branagh is a genius.

B000HCO8IQ|5.0|I first heard the Scissor Sisters at social dances (ballroom and club dancing). After a while, I realized that some of my favorite songs from the dances were by the same group. They're fairly inappropriate for many social situations, but certain not for dancing, or even listening to in the car.
0312427646|3.0|This one had been lurking for a while on my Mt. To-Be-Read, and last night I was looking for something to lightly amuse me on a very cold night. Being the inveterate Royal-watcher that I am, I knew that this was one novella that I needed to read, so I settled in with a good, stiff cup of tea and started to read.<br /><br />Alan Bennett, a very successful author, takes on England's monarchy in this cheerful little tale of subversion and literary adventures. With spare prose, he poses the question of what if The Queen, England's current monarch and head of the Commonwealth, turned into a reader? And we're talking not of those many documents that she reviews in her special red boxes but novels? And as with readers who come to love their books, what if she turned into a passionate, compulsive reader?<br /><br />Such is the premise here, when the Queen's troop of corgis take off after a van fitted out as a lending library. In an attempt to be polite, she checks out a book by Ivy Compton-Burnett. And she meets a young man who works in the Palace as a kitchen skivvy, Norman Seakins, who actually does read books. Gradually, the two develop a sort-of friendship, and Norman incurs the jealousy of palace staff, and the Queen's knowledge of literature grows apace with poor Norman's rise to becoming as it were, the Queen's Reader.<br /><br />Soon enough, the Queen starts to resent her official duties as Monarch, preferring to spend her time reading -- and that natural corollary to being bookish, thinking about her reading. Some think she's getting senile, what with the notebooks full of her thoughts and scribbles, and the eventual chaos that erupts when the outside world learns that she's a reader. Books, not flowers, are being presented to her on royal walkabouts, and slowly there is a growing revolution growing in the palace.<br /><br />This rather tongue-in-cheek story had me chuckling in spots, thoughtful in others, but at the end, disappointed. While I did enjoy Mr. Bennett's use of very clever prose, it was the ending that finally ruined the book for me. Too, Mr. Bennett seems to be taking a backhanded swipe at everyone who doesn't read, at least doesn't read what he likes, and especially at the institution of monarchy itself. By the time I got to the end of this one, I was heartily bored, and just glad to see the story end.<br /><br />It's good for an hour or two of reading -- it's less than 120 pages in length, and printed in a small format -- but I won't be wasting any of my time on a reread. Somehow I think that Britain's Royals are not this vapid or befuddled, and while I do know that this is satire, it just didn't feel right or too believable.<br /><br />Depending on your tolerance for the silly, or the weird, or mockery of conservative establishment, this might suit. Or it might not. One never knows.<br /><br />Overall, three stars. Somewhat recommended.t was the ending that finally ruined the book for me.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Many people have been describing this album as a \\"return to form\\", linking it to Justice for All and therefore calling it a comeback. It is... partly true.  True, the songs are very complex and mostly long, à la ...Justice. True, Kirk Hammett and his solos are back, with a vengeance.    But this album also incorporates elements from more recent albums: some catchy choruses are reminiscent of the black album (BBS, Unforgiven III, Cyanide), and although nobody seems to notice James' vocals have a raw edge not dissimilar to the one he had on the must-maligned St Anger.    So, the only acceptable negative comment for this album is that for the first time since I listen to them (20 years!), Metallica here has not explored new boundaries or tried to innovate. Stupid metalheads hate Load/ Reload, but those albums were remarkable if only because of the blues, country and jazz influences that they incorporated. S&M is another example of innovation, as is St Anger (please name another band who makes their most violent album after 20 years??)    Still, Death Magnetic is a masterpiece because of the quality of the songs it has, which mostly incorporate the elements that have made Metallica legends in the first place. And since they have also incorporated their later experience, it is not a \\"step back\\".    My favorite songs are:  1. That Was Just Your Life is a 7 minute monster, the rythm section and riffage are simply amazing. The intro seems to prove they are alive, and yes they are!! An incredible song    3. BBS Changes in rythm, great lyrics, catchy chorus excellent    4. The Day That Never Comes: The 1st single... If you like Fade, One or Sanitarium, this one is for you. The last part of the song is insanely fast yet one can distinctively hear the overlapping guitar harmonies.    5. All Nightmare Long. Great intro, rythm guitar, chorus although James does not sing as much... huge solos and brutal finish. Incredible    7. Unforgiven 3. Controversial, this one has grown on me, I think the lyrics are beautiful. And this one actually contains an innovation ... shhh surprise    10. My Apocalypse. The Modern Day equivalent of Damage or Dyers Eve    I ve heard Cyanide live twice in September in Europe and I have to say it sounds better and edgier live than on the album.    Enjoy and don t believe the haters that love Metallica bashing, this is  another masterpiece!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Ok...<br />I am 14 and I am IN LOVE with this album! The songs are moving and bring me to tears (White Horse and The Best Days)<br />My all time favorite song is probably 'You Belong with Me' which talks about a guy she loves but is with someone else!<br />Taylor swift is such a role model for young girls and I will recommend ALL people get this album!
B00003CXTG|5.0|I don't even know why people would even compare this movie to The Titanic.  Pearl Harbor Came out in 2001--4 years after The Titanic.  It also came out just in time for The 60th Anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  I was living on Hickam AFB, Hawaii, right across the street from Pearl Harbor when the DVD was first released and I bought it right away.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I was basically living right where the whole battle took place.  Living on the base and watching this film, I immediatley felt the undenying emotion of the whole bombing and thought the love triangle was very realistic.  Things that really do happen in everyday life--especially in military life.  Also, like somebody already said in one of their reviews--\\"IT'S A MOVIE, NOT A DOCUMENTARY!\\"
0312983867|2.0|But I have to say this series is going downhill for me.  The total lack of positive development in Stephanie's character makes her tedious and annoying.  In fact, the only character who seems to be developing at all is Stephanie's mom.  I found myself more interested in her than I was in her daughter at times.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />One thing I hate in a book is the implausible action that leads to the Big Event.  There is NO WAY Morelli would have handed her the keys to his truck to go get pizza BY HERSELF while the crazy maniac after her was still at large.  Especially when there were cops galore who could take her, or a phone to get delivery.  It was just pointless and stupid.  And not necessary.  Said cop taking her to Pino's could have been ambushed and there you go.<br /><br />And to add to that dissatisfaction we get Stephanie sleeping with Ranger (we all knew that was going to happen sooner or later -- and I was just glad she wasn't actually *cheating* on Morelli) and then bopping right back to Joe about 24 hours later with zero awkwardness.  And Joe is like a teenager, thinking her harrowing brush with a sexual sadist murderer is a catalyst for a night in the sack.<br /><br />Add to that Ranger's turning into a coercive seducer (even as he admits Joe's a 'good guy' who 'loves her') and you've got the makings of a real bummer.<br /><br />Because I'm irrevocably turned off by cheating and adultery I felt the need to spoil myself by looking ahead at reviews on Amazon.  Unfortunately I see that Stephanie is going to go further down the skank hole and become truly faithless and that's just not for me.  I'd be fine with Ranger as a love interest if Joe weren't still in the picture, but there he is and, regardless of his scummy past, he's been a good guy since the beginning.  I have to like the lead character in the book and it's looking bad for Steph.  I recently posted on a message board that I'm ready for both men to dump her and find someone else.  I shouldn't feel that way about the heroine, should I?<br /><br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />SPOILER END<br /><br />The slapstick comedy is not as funny as it once was, because we have a foundation now and, without development Stephanie is just a stubborn idiot who really shouldn't be doing that job.  The reader should feel some sympathy, I think, but it's just not happening anymore since the woman is just so stuck on her bad habits.<br /><br />So why do I give it two stars instead of one?  Because Mom and Valerie had some great moments and I appreciated those.<br /><br />Personally, I think it's not always in the series' best interest to go on forever.  I'm starting to prefer an arc in a five to seven book series over the never-ending saga.<br /><br />I recommend buying Hard Eight and all following Plum books used or getting them from the library.  Sad to say it, though.  The series started off so magnificently.  :-(ut the heroine, should I?    *  *  *  *  SPOILER END    The slapstick comedy is not as funny as it once was, because we have a foundation now and, without development Stephanie is just a stubborn idiot who really shouldn't be doing that job.

B0017VG69U|2.0|It is indeed poor business practice for Paramount to abandon the HD-DVD version of this series, as, for some of us, it was the only reason we bought the HD-DVD players in the first place. I'm sure it would look much better in HD.     Agree with others that the package is not so good either. The hinge and latch are hard to close, especially if the discs aren't perfectly placed in the case.    I'm glad they went to the trouble to remaster them. It's just too bad you can't really enjoy the better master quality in HD.
B001GQACGO|5.0|I'm european and if I don't pay close attention to the lyrics I miss most of the them, however the melody - for all 16 tracks - is awesome. There's not one song that I don't like. I believe she truly expressed herself without caring too much about competing with Rihanna & co. I've never enjoyed a CD so much. Two thumbs up for me.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|It's been five months since the release of Coldplay's \\"Viva La Vida\\" album, and while I was quite enthused when it came out, I must also admit this: I haven't played it nearly as often as I thought I would, and certainly a lot less as compared to their other albums. Now comes this release, a companion EP.<br /><br />\\"Prospekt's March\\" (8 tracks; 28 min.) is billed as \\"8 new tracks\\" and in the technical sense that is certainly true, but a closer look reveals a slightly different picture. Two tracks are slightly redone from the album: \\"Lost\\", now with Jay-Z rapping for about 30 sec. midway through the song (for no rhyme or reason), and a remix of \\"Lovers In Japan\\", which really doesn't sound that different. Another track is the fleshed out opening of the short instrumental of the album, and I like \\"Life in TechniColor II\\" quite a lot actually. Then another track, \\"Postcards from Far Away\\" is a 45 sec. piano interlude.<br /><br />So that leaves in reality 4 new tracks for us to sink our teeth in. \\"Glass of Water\\" is the very best of them, an epic piano-driven stomper that is among the very best, if not better than anything on the \\"Viva\\" album, just outstanding, and this EP worth is the admission price for this alone. \\"Rainy Day\\" is nice, but non-essential\\". \\"Prospeckt's March/Poppy Fields\\" is really 2 short songs stapled together, not unlike a number of the songs on \\"Viva\\", and quite nice. The other \\"must have\\" nugget on here, though, is the closer \\"Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground\\", a 2 min. introspective song with just Chris and his acoustic guitar, reminiscent of, say, \\"The Blue Room EP\\", just beautiful.<br /><br />In all, this is a very welcome addition to the \\"Viva la Vida\\" album, and to the Coldplay catalog, period. At $5.99, this is a no-brainer. BUY IT.
0897500482|5.0|I have read/studied this book several many times and it is packed full of a very revolutionary martial art. The methods, principles and practices that it uses from all other kinds of martial arts and sports is invaluable. Anyone who seeks to become a student of an impenetrable martial art should first read/study this book several many times. Then, if one wants to go further in this martial art (which is really not a martial art in some ways) should seek a JKD training center and/or a JKD certified instructor.
B0002NRQTI|4.0|After spending the last several years laboring as a better-than-average -- and highly professional -- pop group, Rush returned to its hard-rock roots on COUNTERPARTS. Also, despite the presence of a couple of clunkers, they managed to come up with a fairly strong set of songs. The result was the band's best effort to date since GRACE UNDER PRESSURE.     The album opens with a really astounding 1-2-3 punch. On \\"Animate\\" the group manages to deconstruct a riff that sounds like it is straight off of a Pearl Jam record and to turn it into a bit of frothy hard prog-rock. \\"Stick it Out\\" is probably Rush's heartiest slab of metal since 2112 and is a heck of a lot of fun. \\"Cut to the Chase\\" is another strong up-tempo rocker which manages to sustain the momentum generated by the first two tracks.     After that, the record settles down a little. The best of the remaining tracks are \\"Between Sun and Moon,\\" \\"Cold Fire,\\" and \\"Leave That Thing Alone.\\" \\"Nobody's Hero,\\" despite having one of the more ham-fisted verses ever written (the first), is still a good power ballad, complete with a fittingly over-the-top orchestration from Michael Kaman.     The only real dog here is \\"The Speed of Love\\" which should have been titled \\"The Speed of a Slug.\\" \\"Double Agent\\" certainly has problems as well, but at least it has certain parts that I like a lot. I am torn over the spoken bits, because I love the guitar parts in those sections, but they still come across as a little dumb.    Over-all, COUNTERPARTS represented a fine return to form by Rush and hinted at what was to come on their next three superlative albums. I am not sure if it is an essential Rush record, but it is still pretty darned good.
B001GJ3VYG|5.0|Though Dido still sounds unmistakably like herself on her new album it is still obviously very different from her first two. Though some tunes are actually very melodic and catchy, don't expect to find big radio hits like \\"White Flag\\" or \\"Life for Rent\\".<br /><br />The tone is generally darker, and many of the songs lyrically deal with theme of loss. Though some fans may be disappointed with Dido's new direction, I'm sure she will win new fans with this new record, which really shows the versatile artist she really is.<br /><br />The first track \\"Don't Believe in Love\\" which has been chosen for the first single off the album, has been hailed by many as one of the best tracks - I don't agree. It's a funky track with a good beat, but it really doesn't have a very memorable melody.<br /><br />In my view the next song \\"Quiet Times\\" is much stronger. It's an acoustic melodic song and for me one of several highlights on the album; though probably no good choice for a single.<br /><br />\\"Never Want to Say it's Love\\" is a bluesy and cathcy tune, which I would seriosly have considered for a single - brings forward memories of the late Dusty Springfield.<br /><br />\\"Grafton Street\\" is one of the key songs on the album. It's a dark and sad song, with some great Celtic sounds adding a lot of atmosphere to the great tune.<br /><br />\\"It Comes and it Goes\\" is a lighter song and another track that may lead your thoughts towards Dusty Springfield og Burt Bacharach.<br /><br />\\"Look No Further\\" was the first song to be released for download and it stands out as one of greatest tracks on the album. It has some of the beautiful simplicity as some of John Lennon's finest songs ( like \\"Imagine\\" or \\"Jealous Guy\\" ).<br /><br />\\"Us 2 Little Gods\\" is an acoustic upbeat song, that probably a song that the sounds the most like her earlier songs.<br /><br />\\"The Day Before the Day\\" is another sad quiet song dealing with theme of losing one you love. A very moving song.<br /><br />\\"The Things we Normally Do\\" is a catchy melodic tune. A great original string arrangement - makes think of Suzanne Vega and her \\"Nine Objects of Desire\\" album.<br /><br />\\"Burning Love\\" is another nice acoustic song, but probably the least memorable song on the album.<br /><br />The closing track, the grandiose \\"Northern Skies\\" is another key track. Playing for almost 9 minutes it is a logical choice to close the album. A haunting tune that makes me think of the great late Sandy Denny - it really sounds like a song she could have written.<br /><br />On the Deluxe version of the album there 3 more tracks that all are great additions.<br /><br />\\"For One Day\\" is a funky track that would have fitted nicely into the album - a little in the same vein as \\"I Don't Believe in Love\\".<br /><br />\\"Summer\\" is a great acoustic song that for incomprehensively reasons was not selected for the album.<br /><br />The shorter version of \\"Northern Skies\\" is at least as strong as the long version - and nice to have this shorter version too.<br /><br />A very commendable album.makes think of Suzanne Vega and her \\"Nine Objects of Desire\\" album.    \\"Burning Love\\" is another nice acoustic song, but probably the least memorable song on the album.

1401307957|3.0|As other reviewers note, this is one man's journal that came about after his wife had an unexpected, life-changing accident.  It is inspirational in the sense that Danny encourages you to do the same, and his own work is absolutely charming, but it is NOT a book on how to draw or make an art journal.  I bring this up because this book comes up on searches linked to books that are geared that way, and as such can be misleading.  It is far more akin to an autobiography than an art instruction book, and I thought a more clear explanation would help others in knowing what they're getting.
B000GG4Y32|2.0|For the life of me I will NEVER understand the following for this movie... not even among hopeless and hapless lefties!  If I were them, I would demand a much better film...    Warren Beatty runs around grinning with his 80's hair falling in his face... utterly unconvincing as a journalist, radical, or human being.  Diane Keaton seems intent on portraying Louise Bryant as a sympathetic and idealistic dreamer; she comes off as unbelievably selfish and whiney [probably an inadventent accuracy, actually!]    The costuming is horrible.   Honestly WHERE was the 30 million bux even spent??   The cut of the clothes is almost always off... hairstyles bear NO resemblance to those of the teen years and '20s... even the dialogue is full of unbearable modern colloquialisms.    And I could go on and ON... no kidding.    Seriously lefties... demand a better film.  LOL
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I never get tired of listening to this CD. I highly recommend it. We also have the DVD and watch alot. We are even luckly enough to go to LA in March to see them at the Nokia Theatre. Can't wait. Always a fan.
0440238609|5.0|The story is brilliant whether one is Christian or not.  Enjoy it for it's entertainment value.  Friendship, loyalty, and self sacrifice for the greater good of humanity.  That a young girl could have such a profound understanding of her own purpose, a greater responsibility than any being other than God Himself.  Some people found the books more difficult to read as they progressed, but I feel the story became more rich as you read.  A little difficult for a child to read, but a worthy title for even the pickiest reader's bookcase.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I loved this GnR CD. They are one of my favorite bands and this has all the songs I love.
B000089RV6|5.0|The entire album is good, head banging, body rocking fun that lifts you out of your chair and onto the floor to shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it!  I love all kinds of music.  My heart, though, belongs to rock, and this is the bruising, sexy rock that I missed during my R & B and Rap years.  But, I'm Back...In Black!
0745134432|4.0|Len Deighton claims, in the Acknowledgements, to have read over two-hundred books in research for this novel, including one Karl Otto Hoffman's three volume history of the development of German Radar from 1933-1945, and, after finishing this book, one can well believe it.  Not one tick of a Lancaster's variometer is left undescribed, nor is one speck of phosphorous burning through flesh from an incendiary bomb, nor is one pipe in a small German town's water system and nor are any of the truly horrific ways in which one can become dismembered, have one's flesh liquefied, be mauled, suddenly frozen, buried alive, eviscerated etc. in an incendiary bomb raid. - All are duly explored and fully depicted herein. - The book bombards, so to speak, the reader's sensorium with detail upon detail.<br /><br />Some of this, for me, was very striking - especially the aeronautical details.  My father was (and is) a pilot and an aeronautical engineer. And while never having flown in a military aircraft myself, my father was on some of the design teams for more advanced military aircraft still in use by the RAF (like the \\"jump jet\\"), and I went up with my father almost every weekend in our small prop-propelled aeroplane.  I remember the altimeter, the mixture control, the stall light, the variometer (which tells one the speed at which one is ascending or descending), the smell of aviation fuel etc. ---They don't seem to have had horizontal stabilisers back then though, which for me, as a lad, when my Dad let me take control, was always the most fascinating instrument.  It's VERY difficult to fly perfectly aligned with the horizon (nor is it necessary, basically an aeroplane flies in a rough sine wave according to the pockets of air it crosses), but it's rather a fun game for a seven year old to see how close he can get to perfection and how long he can maintain it. -Ahem, not very long at all. -  But why am I mentioning all this technical rubbish?  Because, again, the book is chock-full of it, and it's hard for me to imagine anyone except boffins like myself taking much of an interest in it. But there it is, even unto the ending of the book, where you are hanging on the edge of your seat as the battered planes land and wondering whether these chaps you feel you've come to know are going to cop it or come in safely or what, whilst ailerons, flaps and rudder control are still being explained in the greatest detail.<br /><br />Basically, the structure of the book is that of a thriller, tightly wound.  One knows what is going to transpire, so the \\"catch\\" of the book, as it were, is the wait, amongst Germans, Brits and readers, to see, exactly, very exactly, how all this carnage and mayhem unfold. Herein lies my slight reservation about the book.  You will be, by turns, excited, terrified, and exhausted in the reading of it. - Also, if you don't skip these technical parts, which constitute about half of the book, you will be informed as to all manner of things. - But, stylistically, this has a jarring effect.  Leighton seems to want to cram something from each of those 200+ books he has read into the narrative, so that there is this constant switching and shunting between technical manual and narrative, from page to page, paragraph to paragraph and, more often than not, within a paragraph.  This aspect, for me, detracted from the experience of the reading.<br /><br />I think Bomber is probably the best novelistic account a highly intelligent, technically savvy and curious reader could possibly find about British night-bombing in WWII.  But the details put a drag on the narrative that, to belabour a metaphor, sends the tale that's being told here into a stall that's hard to pull out of at several points.<br /><br />To conclude, it's more difficult to pull a narrative out of a stall than it is an aeroplane.  And, really, it shouldn't be required of the reader.  On the other hand, for readers who enjoy such challenges, don't hesitate to lower the flaps, gun the throttle and take off into the reading of this fascinating book.ff into the reading of this fascinating book.
0061655546|5.0|Jump right into the middle of one of the biggest and most tumultuous leveraged buyouts in history.  After reading this book, you will feel as though you know the players involved...everybody from F. Ross Johnson at RJR Nabisco to Peter Atkins, the lawyer from Skadden Arps who handled the bidding.  The information contained in this book is worth at least 6 semester hours toward your MBA!  In fact, I'd venture to say that reading books like \\"Barbarians at the Gate\\" will leave you better prepared than almost any MBA program in the United States.<br /><br />Can you tell I loved this book????
B000LGZHDS|4.0|My kids love Spongebob (and all the rest of his crew).  I bought Gary because Spongebob needs Gary!  I was impressed with the detail of Gary and his size is nice too.  If you have a beanie baby collection (which I do not but we all love Spongebob) he would make an excellent addition!
0596009208|3.0|This book is written really well in the sense that it explains the particular topic in a casual everyday manner, making it very easy to understand.  I progressed through the entire book and found this to be the case regardless of difficulty of topic.  I have 2 big issues with this book:  1: After reading the book, and then opening up my McKenzie 'Mock Exam Questions' book for the SCJA to any random page (pgs 258-260 in this case, questions 12-2 thru 12-5) and trying to answer these 4, I found that the notation and terminology specified in those question was not mentioned in HFJ.  Such as 'composite' & 'multiplicity', 'associated with'; the \\"-\\" in the class diagram meaning private, \\"+\\" meaning public.    So while the book is very easy to read, I'm not convinced there's a real correlation to passing the SCJA exam without studying McKenzie's questions and the answers.  2: there isn't nearly enough practice problems that the student can use to bring the just-explained concept home.  There are the Code Magnets, 1 per chapter, sometimes, which I think are great, the Pool puzzles are fun, and the True/False I believe have value.  Only one of each per 50page chapter, not nearly enough. But the Crossword puzzles I never attempted, nor the 'Five Minute Mystery', which is basically a word problem.   Even typing in their code examples manually along the way just to see them run and try to let the coding constructs sink in was only minimally helpful.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I love this album.  It's just plain fun!  It's about drinking, sex or both ... for the most part.  It's great music for driving, for the gym or just to make you smile.  If you just want to download the good songs, you might as well buy the whole album because all the songs are good ... these are the great ones (in my opinion)<br /><br />Something In Your Mouth<br />Burn It To The Ground<br />Gotta Be Somebody<br />I'd Come For You<br />Shakin' Hands<br />S.E.X<br />This Afternoon
B0012GMV4O|5.0|Another fine DCD to add to my collection, replacing<br />the popping / skipping / crackling / stuck vinyl record.<br /><br />I recommend this seller.<br /><br />regards,<br />Tony J. Podrasky
B001ACH4DS|3.0|I really wanted to love this album because I love his voice, but the album is a bit boring.  'Light On' is a great song and a couple others are pretty good but overall it's just ok.  Hopefully the next album will grab me more.
B000002BBY|5.0|The debut album by Oasis was a worldwide success - 2.1 million in sales in the UK, 6 million in the rest of the world, but only a million or so of that in the US. The follow up was a whole different story altogether - 23+ million worldwide with over 4 million in each of the US and the UK (3rd best selling LP of all time there). For most fans the next five releases haven't come close to reaching the great heights of these first two. Accordingly, I thought that I'd give them each a re-listen in order to see how they've stood up to the passage of a decade and a half.<br /><br />First off, the obvious, the 23 million who bought this cd weren't wrong - this is a spectacularly good album. One brilliantly infectious song follows another for about forty exciting minutes. Wonderwall, Don't look Back in Anger, Hey Now!, Some Might Say, Morning Glory and Champagne Supernova - each song possesses the kind of quality that by itself would form the cornerstone of any other cd. Indeed, as I listen I have to remind myself that I'm not listening to a greatest hits collection.<br /><br />In the music biz it is unusual for an artist to begin a career with a really first class record and then surpass that effort with the follow-up. It was fourteen years ago that Oasis hit the ground running with their debut, Definitely Maybe. A year later the band delivered its sophomore effort, (What's the Story) Morning Glory. They are both five star offerings. The relative mediocrity of the other cds in their catalogue should not in any way diminish the greatness of their earlier music. If, like me, you have allowed these cds to sit on the shelf, unplayed, for the last decade, I'd suggest that you clean of the dust and give them a spin. You will be rewarded with some of the best music of the past twenty years.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|This is a must see for Paramore fans!The CD is fantastic--Hayley sounds awesome!I liked hearing the crowd, it made me feel like I was there.And the dvd really gives you an inside look at how down to earth and cool they really are.Worth every penny!
B000002C25|3.0|This cd isn't awful. The word that to me best describes Oasis' third release is disappointing. After two superb recordings I was expecting so much more. I wanted these fellows to keep their streak alive. They didn't come close! Compared to Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory the music here is plodding, heavy handed and unimaginative. The songs are too long and, at 72 minutes, so is the cd. I don't know whether the lack of \\"spark\\" is a result of trying too hard or not hard enough? What I do know is that I wanted to love this when it was released eleven years ago (I didn't) and I wanted to discover that I was initially mistaken when I listened again today (I wasn't). So there you have it! On the other hand I have continued to purchase Oasis cds as they are released. As of November 2008 I am still hopeful that the boys will rediscover the magic and, indeed, I have to admit that there have been exciting moments on each of their last three. However, as far as Be Here Now is concerned it's back to the cd rack for another decade. Maybe in 2018........?
B001LMRCP2|4.0|I'd never been a Coldplay fan but I bought Viva La Vida and really liked it.  I saw that they now had a new release of the album including this EP or the EP on its own and wondered if it was worth it.  Today, Amazon had it for $0.99 so I gave it a try--I really enjoyed listening to it.  \\"Lost+\\" was kind of disappointing--when Jay-Z came in it had a real MST3K vibe to it, but overall I thought the EP was a no-brainer at $.99 and I'd say would be worth it even at the regular price of around $5.    Bottom line: if you like Viva La Vida, pick up the EP--it's a nice supplement.
B000VJ4OUM|4.0|great year. i was 8 years old. a fun movie with great songs. very enjoyable to watch. one little flaw. the 2 DVD's kept falling off the cheap foam sprockets. i had to place the discs in seperate covers. UA should have packed them more carefully. anyway,enjoy.****
B001EO2UJK|5.0|This is a true rebirth. I discovered delicate sounds that have been hidden in previous releases. Until now we have been listening this great music from behind a wall. The mixing is superb, crisp and clear sound. A must have for the real Genesis fans.
B000002OQT|5.0|i truly love this soundtrack. it's beautiful & touching. wish there were more tracks on it. 10 to 14 would have been better. i hope they'll release another edition.  i listen to this quite a lot. enjoy. ****
B001ED7C58|4.0|This was a very enjoyable cd. A person doesn't have to see the movie to enjoy the music this cd brings! It was delightful!!
B00011KHTM|5.0|What else can I say? Apple products are quality and I'm very happy with this adapter.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Well, I just saw The Shooter and I must say, why did I wait soooo long??  Great movie from beginning to end. Mark Wahlberg turns in a solid performance along with an excellent ensemble cast. Had me on the edge of my seat from the sort of botched, attempted assasination to cold blooded revenge in the end. Damn, doesn't it feel good when the good guys win!!! OOOOOOHAAAA!!!
0439574285|5.0|In the past, this book gave me much joy.<br /><br />But now it teaches me about life, for a simple example, \\"Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent.\\" (A case of Identity).
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with this film.  Mind readers and aliens belong on a Stargate sequel, not Indiana Jones, but that's exactly what happens here.  There is some good action, some decent humor, but the plot is absolute garbage.  For me, I'm going to pretend that this Indiana Jones movie never existed.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|I love the new portrayal of James Bond. Not all the flashy tech, not over-doing the womanizing, just a kickass guy who knows his stuff and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Much more realistic than previous versions, he actually gets beat up! Just love the plot line, which is something hollywood doesn't deliver as often as they used to.
