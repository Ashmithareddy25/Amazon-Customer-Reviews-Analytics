B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved the book so much I pre-oredered in Travis's perspective.  The characters are a little madning sometimes but overall fell in love with them.  Would recommend and if you love it definately pick up Walking Disaster.
B00170F0WU|5.0|Probably one of the best 10 movies I have ever seen in my life. Would recommend for anyone.<br /><br />*NOTE (With some spoilers): This is the American version of the release, and has multiple scenes removed from the film that are important to character development, though they are uncomfortable since they show Leon teaching Matilda how to &#34;clean&#34;.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Great value for the price!!! Lightweight, durable, used it right after receiving it, very happy with product quality. Highly recomend this product!
B00284G2IA|5.0|is't the best band that I've ever seen and I recomend to watch this concert and buy it to keep in memories
B003B02O7I|5.0|I get the impression that John Grisham must have just a bit of a warped mind, due to this and other of his works. There is no definable doubt as to the amount of labor and research that he must put into his accomplishments. I find it hard to discern how he envisions and then produces such an explicit picture of the total disintegration of the moral fiber of humanity. What I like most is the way he adds so many tidbits of our frailties, just to keep our minds guessing as to the final outcome of his stories,many of which end in a surprising manner. Like most of his works, I have enjoyed reading it more than once, and in a year or so will probably do so again.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable.  Well worth my Prime membership.  Looking forward to season 4 next.<br />Special effects are well done and virtually flawless.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|Im not going to do an \\"in-depth\\" review on this like some of the others here have and will do. But I will write about how I feel about it :)<br /><br />When I first heard the track \\"Starwaves\\" that was posted on SoundCloud, I knew this soundtrack was going to be amazing. I must have played that song on loop all day long. Starwaves is one of those songs that give you goosebumps. Its starts out low and relaxing; like the beginning of a good story - to an invigorating, goosebump riddled, \\"i think i shat myself\\" feeling at the 3/4 mark when the song hits its climax and breaks down. Its sort of like going from a cold glazed Krispy Kreme donut, to a warm, freshly glazed Krispy Kreme donut.<br /><br />In other words, this album is delicious.<br /><br />It will be interesting once I see the movie... I think its just going to develop my love for this album even more. Joseph's work on the Tron Legacy soundtrack was excellent along with the tv show side of Tron. Ive never heard of him before this, and didn't realize he composed the soundtrack for Tron - but I am really looking forward to what he does next!!!
B00B37ET42|2.0|Fitzgereald's voice is true, I just hated the characters.  Depressing.  I wouldn't spend two minutes with either of them. I had to finish the book, but I can't say that I enjoyed it.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie is the greatest documented movie of the crimes of the food industry.  It has really changed my way of thinking.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|some times too slow and methodical, but a fun book to read. A suspenful mystery novel for good entertainment in the classical Clancy style

B0052RDHTM|5.0|He has generated reader recall of long forgotten historical facts through his blend of colorful and personable characters. Then again, it is expected from a writer who can get readers excited about the art of cathedral building.
B000FA675C|5.0|I just finished The DaVinci Code (finally got to it)  and it was as exciting as every other Dan Brown novel that I've read.  Thought I knew who did it, and I was wrong!  I love books like that!  Looking forward to the new one next month.  Time to pre-order....
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My 12 yr old daughter read this book in 1 day while we were on vacation.  I did not read it though.

B00947N6D8|5.0|Great Family movie, we loved it,we give thumbs up. You have to watch it again and again.<br />Again we loved it.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|What can I say other than WOW.  This is a terrific CD.  How did I never hear of Leonard Cohen before !!!  He is an amazing songwriter.  Love this !!!
B00AO3K01C|5.0|Its the kind of book that can change your life, vindicate the depths you thought were there but doubted. It's about enlightenment, but it's funny sad too.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I choose this game because it looked very fun to play.  It occupies you when you are bored and it make time goes by.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I love to read on the go and was beyond happy to download the Kindle App for my phone, but it seems like once I updated the app it started having problems.  This app freezes up ALL the time!!  It is really hard to enjoy a book when it keeps freezing up on you.  Pleaseeeee fix this problem.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|While the purple color of the leather is what attracted me at first (and there are a lot of other colors), the functionality is what made me buy it.  It allows you to stand your Kindle up either widescreen or portrait.  There's also a strap that lets you hold it safely with one hand...perfect for reading.  The elastic, black strap you see in the picture helps hold the case shut and make sure the Kindle goes into sleep mode, and it can be used to hold the case in place when not using the stand.<br /><br />Thanks to the Kindle allowing you to look at the screen from all sides, the case swivels smoothly so you can view it however you're most comfortable.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|The movie itself... eh. It's one of those movies that gets less good every time you watch it. The story is serviceable (just once I want the Latina toughgirl in a Cameron movie to be the sole survivor). The main reason to have this is that the 3D is done so well. If you've invested in a stereoscopic 3D set up, this is the reference disk you want to show it off. Cameron has a great sense of cinematography, and no director really gets 3D like he does.
1400052181|5.0|This book is by far one of the best books I have read.  It amazed me how much one woman can be such an important aspect of our lives but yet so few of us know her story.  It's heart-wrenching at times, but I had a hard time putting it down.
B0079J28NC|5.0|Not only do I love this movie, but my grandson who is totally into super-heroes has fallen in love with these super-heroes. He says &#34;John's super power is love.&#34;<br /><br />I love all the bonus materials, stickers, booklet, transparencies.<br /><br />Best purchase in a while!
B008KWHM6U|4.0|Following an album like Tourist History would be difficult for any group and surely Two Door Cinema Club knew that going into this effort. Thankfully they gave themselves some breathing room and the result is a mature and sophisticated follow-up that expands their sound without sacrificing what made them great in the first place. The band does a great job of creating a consistent sound and developing an upbeat sound full of sunny vocals, fuzzy synths, and guitar-driven indie pop. Songs like \\"Next Year\\", \\"Handshake\\", and \\"The World Is Watching\\" are irresistible and full of hooks to keep them in your head long after they're finished. There's a seamless flow to this record that makes both the individual songs and the album as a whole gel together incredibly well. In a day and age of cherry picking and instant singles it's refreshing to find a group dedicated to offering a complete and immersive album experience. Other tracks like \\"Pyramid\\" go through shifts in tempo and dynamics with thrilling results. TDCC keep things simple while adding just enough curve balls to thrill you as soon as you begin to become complacent.<br /><br />The only real flaw is that this consistent sound does work against a few of the tracks, causing them to sound too similar and lose a bit of their identity in the swirl of guitars and loops. The songs themselves are solid but telling some of these tracks apart is difficult if you're not intimately familiar with them. Thankfully this rewards repeated listens and those willing to look beyond a couple of the singles.<br /><br />Beacon is a fun and shimmering example of what happens when talented musicians get together and focus on making something both challenging and accessible. The band isn't resting on their laurels but they also stay within the realms of their debut. This is a delicate balance and TDCC gets it right. Highly recommended.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I love this controller.  Even skinned it out to make sure my sons don't &#34;mistakenly&#34; use it.  They know it's mine and that I use it for MY PS3.
B0000019PA|5.0|I'm not going to write a huge and detailed review of this masterpiece because there's really no need. Fans and music critics the world over have been writing about this record for the past 15 years and by now you've probably made up your mind as to whether this is a twisted work of genius or an overrated, confused piece of garbage. Obviously I'm in the first group but I can understand why this album may turn many people off. The production is fuzzy at best, Jeff Mangum's voice is all over the place, and the lyrics are absolutely strange. However, it's those very elements that make this album stand out. Love it or hate it, you can't deny that it gets people talking.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite albums and that's really saying something. I originally bought it on iTunes and loved it so much on my first listen that I went out and decided I would not return home until I managed to hunt down a physical copy. Rarely does a record stir up that kind of devotion but Mangum managed to do exactly that with In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. This album speaks to people and touches something personal inside of us, even if we can't explain exactly what it is or why. It's a beautiful and stunning piece of work that has touched a generation in ways we never could have expected.
B000NMY7CM|4.0|Always provides a laugh as it deals with a tough subject. . . . . . . . . .
B000001EAQ|5.0|\\"It starts out with a party and ends with a funeral.\\" This is the way Bono once described Pop, U2's ninth album. Released in the spring of 1997, it went on to sell more than 8 million copies worldwide and spawned the massive and daring PopMart Tour. Yet with all that success and fame it seems that fans, critics, and even the band members themselves have issues with this album. Out of every album in their catalogue this one seems to divide fans more than any other. Some find it brilliant and daring, a strong statement of the band's depth and willingness to experiment while others claim it's an unfinished and overblown album that didn't live up to it's potential. As a diehard U2 fan I've always loved this album and the approach the band took. Just because it \\"ends with a funeral\\" doesn't mean it isn't worth attending.<br /><br />\\"Discotheque\\" opens the record in an upbeat style. The Edge plays a killer guitar groove and Bono's lyrics, while appearing to be fun on the surface, hint at something much darker underneath. This is one area where Pop warrants further investigation, as the colorful artwork and danceable rhythms disguise heavier themes of death, materialism, the trials of faith, and the complexities of love and relationships. Those who write this off as a fun party album aren't listening closely enough. \\"Do You Feel Loved\\" is an overlooked gem and Adam Clayton's bass line is the real star here. It's a groove that sticks in your head and hits your chest from the get-go. \\"Miami\\" gets a lot of flack but it's a diverse and interesting trip-hop number that sounds like nothing they've done before or since.<br /><br />However, it's \\"Mofo\\" that's arguably the heaviest track here, a full techno/dance number that lyrically is an updated take on \\"I Will Follow\\" as Bono mourns the loss of his mother and examines his own life in relation to his faith and family. It's long been a fan favorite and brings all of the musical and lyrical themes of the album together in one tremendous song. The troubles in northern Ireland are addressed in \\"Staring at the Sun\\" and \\"Please\\", two of the finest political songs the band has ever composed. The sexy lounge number \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" finds Bono at his most romantic and the band at their most atmospheric and sensual. \\"If God Will Send Hs Angels\\" and the underrated \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" find Bono examining the fleeting satisfaction of consumer culture and a world where instant gratification is sought more than true faith and things of eternal consequence. His ability to draw parallels between eternal salvation (Heaven) and what the world considers paradise (The Playboy Mansion) is stunning and a perfect example of his lyrical prowess and talent.<br /><br />U2 is a rock band at heart and that comes through in \\"Last Night on Earth\\" and \\"Gone\\", my favorite track from the album. Both are a wonderful mixture of straightforward rock and subtle studio effects that cause them to soar even higher. The closer \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" may just hold the record for the bleakest song in the band's catalogue but it's that very honesty that makes it a winner for me personally. As a Christian I admire Bono's ability to tackle the tough issues of faith and doubt that we all go through without ever jumping ship. All believers have felt this way at one time or another and the words here, while desperate, ring true for those of us who have been through those deserts.<br /><br />Over a decade after its release it seems like Pop is finally getting the recognition and respect it deserves. Fans and critics seem more open to it and hopefully the band will too. They booked their tour before finishing the album and they've always claimed that it's unfinished and needed a bit more work. However, I don't hear anything unrealized or unfinished about it. The rock mixed with electronic elements is solid, Bono's lyrics are some of his finest, Edge's guitar sounds are truly extraordinary, Larry Mullen, Jr.'s drumming is incredibly diverse, and Adam's bass lines are so groovy and thick that you can't help but be sucked into every song. This album is a masterpiece, a monster of sonic and lyrical beauty that disguises darker themes under more upbeat music. Life is full of parties and funerals and I'm glad U2 is there to guide me through both.ibly diverse, and Adam's bass lines are so groovy and thick that you can't help but be sucked into every song.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|Love this CD!  Will wait for the next one to go on sale in the USA.  He has a quirky and soulful tone to is voice.
B00005N6KG|3.0|There are a lot of great qualities about these. They work with the computer or with an ipod when walking & jogging.They are lightweight, adjustable, comfortable, and fit a narrow head. The sound quality is pretty good too. My only qualm is that they've shocked me in the ear a couple of times and within a year of purchase, one of the ear buds died despite my relatively careful care of them. My suggestion to anyone purchasing these is; if you want something long lasting, look elsewhere.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Just was i waiting for, a good product and it comes at the right time. The product is very complete.

B00AMBK0X4|2.0|If you've seen the previews, you've seen the movie.  It's as tasteless as Family Guy is and about as funny.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great fun although it is an english riding game for the first part I would reccomend it for all horse lovers.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Fun little game that plays similar to temple run where you try to travel farther each<br />time. Good way to pass a few minutes.
B00A2FSXHK|3.0|Every streaming video looks fine on the computer, but when I  move to the TV it is very poor quality.  Not even low def, more like no def.  What's up with that?

1451695195|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who wonders about their eternal future!  It is scholarly, and very well written.  As an English major and a minister in the Presbyterian Church I found this book to be an excellent read and it has fortified and deepened my faith and hope.  Every Christian should read this book and share it with their friends and family.
B0031RS7X6|4.0|An entertaining novel with interesting character whom one can easily relate to.  An easy read for an everyday, down to earth girl looking for some comical entertainment.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I put this on my daughters Nabi and she was so excited, but we can't get it to work. no matter what you do on the screen the character jumps. You can't make him turn and sliding is iffy. Very disappointing since OZ Brave worked well. I still hope we can figure out some way to make it work but upset I wasted money on this if we can't play it.
0670451495|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has children of their own, has the care of children, or who is child at heart. :-)
1423136802|5.0|comes in good shipping condition, all five books are wrapped in the case.  The set looks very nice on my bookshelf
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Production values on this show are just outstanding.  The story lines are fascinating.  Watching this has given me an entirely new view of this time in history and people's role in the economy of the time.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|In my mind Lincoln is one of the most respected presidents. Best known for his passing the 13th Amement. A respected man.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game actually makes thinking, planning, and strategizing fun.  It's also a wonderful tiime-waster :)).  Keeps me occupied and out of trouble!
B008764ZQ4|5.0|GREAT MOVIE AND SOUNDTRACK.  iT TOOK ME BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL DANCES AND SWEETHEARTS THAT GOT AWAY.  GOOD PURCHASE THAT i WILL ENJOY FOR A LONG TIME.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This film is loaded with emotional intensity.  Even though the outcome is already known, how it was achieved is engrossing.  The viewer is able to feel the frustrations encountered on every level as well as the overwhelming relief once the mission is accomplished.  Superb acting and directing.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|This cover did nothing to protect my Kindle. It is pretty to look at but serves no purpose as any kind of protection. My 3 month old kindle fell from thr couch onto the floor and the glass broke..I now have to purchase a new one. If you're looking for a pretty cover that offers no type of protection then this is the cover for you. My next Kindle I will cover with a more durable product.
B000001FN3|5.0|There are added extras with the album that I did not want to listen to with each playing, like sample tracks and stuff, but then I remembered, I don't have to select these when syncing.  It is a great, clear re-release of an old favorite!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Recommended for family viewing. Daniel Day Lewis plays a great character. We understand why he was nominated and won an Oscar
B009JBZH54|4.0|Watched Batman Begins for the first time, after hearing good reports and it was even better than I expected. If the other two of the trilogy are as good then it will be a great purchase.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I really liked much of the music from this soundtrack, I only hope that the movie itself will be as good as it looks in all the previews and as good as the music sounds for it! I think it's well worth purchasing if you like the soundtrack genera as I do!
1609611543|5.0|After years of trying to lose weight via various and sundry diet plans, I finally read the book people have been talking about.  THIS BOOK HAS CHANGED MY LIFE...it explains how wheat is a MAJOR culprit in weight gain.  It is PACKED full of useful information.  Once you understand how harmful and ADDICTIVE wheat really is, you can avoid it/slowly remove it from your diet.  If you are struggling to lose weight, this is a MUST READ.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I as many, was rocking out to to most of the songs from this album in the 1980's, I wore out the cassette version and had never gotten it again until I bought this digital version. Although many prefer the track &#34;Billy Jean&#34;, and call it his 'best ever' from that era, that has always been one my least favorites of his! I prefer, &#34;Beat It&#34;, or even &#34;Thriller&#34;. But to have the most great M.J. tracks in one album other than a greatest hits compilation, this would be the one to get!
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|This game is fun and addictive.  If you like a thinking game and don't have lots of time, this one is for you.  Increasingly difficult levels with the ability to restart where you left off or just start that level over.
B003GJSUIQ|5.0|OK, I'll start off that I really like soundtrack music and if it is any good I have no problem buying it for my music collection. This is such a soundtrack by James Horner, he and Thomas Newman are two of my favorite artists in this genera and if you liked the film and the music to, it's worth buying this 'album'.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This is the worst movie for a kid or family.  Too much profanity even from a kid. I would NEVER allow my kids or any kid at that matter to watch this movie.  It isn't even funny, it's stupid.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|As I've said in other reviews I really enjoy movie soundtrack music and this 'album' is a really good one too. After hearing an interview with one of the composers of the film, Hans Zimmer, and he was talking about the musical theme and keeping it very similar in all three films, I got this to hear it! I really like it and think it's worth buying if you like soundtracks.
B00664AM5C|5.0|I love 'puzzle movies'. Ones where the pieces are put together as the story moves forward. 'Contagion' spins a relentless, driven tale of terror and sacrifice, all grounded in a scientific who-dunnit to rival the best of the genre.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app makes using sticky notes a breeze and  more organized. All notes are in one spot and electronic. So convenient.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|A dark, disturbing, compelling puzzle movie, with rich, real characters piecing together a most horrific conclusion. This is one time when the movie surpasses the book in raw energy and emotion.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Up there with The Passion of The Christ for torture porn. And yes it does prove<br />that women can be macho, fanatical zealots too. AMORICA!<br />Disgusting. Boring.
B0042FZWC0|5.0|Great book. Too the point and inspiring.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves travel or hates the idea of a cubical.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Im not a gamer but I loved this movie and my kids enjoy it very much too we watch it all the time and I always notice a different aspect that I never noticed before plus when you pause the movie there is an intermission that explains elaborate details about the movie.. I enjoy it every time.
B008Y79HE6|3.0|If you just want to be entertained, then this is one of many to watch that I would put in that category. I had watched this movie several times before.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|We are glad we bought this on for our Amazon library. The problems this kid gets in are really embarrassing. I really don't like to watch those parts but my kids love it and call me in to watch.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I love the show and wish that it was still going =( every show is very interesting =) =) =)
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Great movie from my childhood, in a newer, better format.  The bonus features alone are worth it, even if you already own the DVD.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's one of the greatest show ever.  I originally thought is was a dumb show, but when my friend told me I needed to see it!!!! We  saw season 1&2 over one week-end and we were hooked, we saw season 3 all day Saturday....We could not stop...It is sooooo good....We are planing a party for the the first episode for season 4 and then a special dinner for subsequential episodes....
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have tried numerous CD' s, apps, even YouTube videos to help me sleep. NOTHING worked until I found this. Flutes, chirping, and high pitch sounds will startle me awake, and it was nearly impossible to find relax music without it (unless you like ocean sounds).<br />This App not only loops the sounds I like, but it allows me to combine my custom mix. I was shocked to find so much of a selection that I would actually use. I wake up in a great mood now.<br />The only set back was that for my particular taste, there was only one or two more sounds in the premium version that I like. If I can do it over, I probably wouldn't upgrade from the free version. On the other hand, for normal people, you will enjoy the pages of added sounds that are not included in the free version. I would absolutely recommend this premium version app any day.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Simple action packed bond movie with excellent throwbacks!!! Excellent bond villain! The only bad of course,is someone should of gave up retirement for the skyfall scenes!!!! That cameo would have been awesome!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent show and plot. The actors performance is also great. Episodes are always interesting and fresh. Nicely done. Will continue to watch.
B000000WJ2|5.0|I had this album back in the 80/90's and it is recorded very well and songs are pretty good.  I'm a hi-fi enthusiast and spent thousands on my stereo system and kept thinking about this album after I sold the first copy.  it was never remastered, but I don't think it needs too!  sound is great and has a nice live feel to the recording sessions.<br /><br />hope you like it too!  btw I don't love the stones.  ironic eh?
B004XXIHS2|5.0|Taut thriller that tells the story of multiple murders and the family scarred by them. Full of amazing descriptions and solid dialog. About my only complaint was that it went on a little too long. Still, tremendous writing.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I had rumors on dvd audio (not video) and this album sounded awesome!  warm, detailed and revealed more stuff in the recording.  finally thought I should have a cd to compare with.  cd sounds good, concerts from late 70s? is fun to hear and extras, outtakes, demos have a few treasures in there!<br /><br />glad I bought it.  hate to be cliche'd but a MUST for any fleetwood mac/nicks buckingham fans!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead! Can't wait for next season and it's an awsome show!! I would recommend it to anyone that's likes thrillers! And zombies!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|My grandson loves the game. He plays it all the time. Good for keeping his attention, and teaching him to use his hands.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This is a fantastic movie!!  My 6 year old and I love it!!  My 2 yr. old loses interest so I would say age 4 and up.  It is well made and I highly recommend it for children and children at heart.

B005K17RU0|5.0|It was a crappy app before the update, but is now totally awesome. Very impressive. Highly recomend and is the best weather app i have tried.
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|You cannot be disappointed by the tasteful blend of wide ranging melodic fare coupled with meaty, crushingly heavy riffs that build to a brilliant conclusion to this two part masterpiece.  House of Gold and Bones Part 2 shows the maturity of these metal heroes in the pinnacle of their song writing art, leaving behind the recklessly messy abandon of past rage filled endeavors for a surgically well aimed death blow of supersonic melody and context. This one will survive the 30 second riff scan and make it's place into a regular rotation on your modern digital sonic template.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It was a well done movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis performances was uncanny.  When you looked at him on screen, you saw Lincoln.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Quality production, BluRay had nice packaging, image quality was beautiful on our 73&#34; HD 3D TV. Better than the theater showing we went to see. We have surround sound -- the audio superb. Will watch this movie over and over an over. Wife liked the second half better than I did. We both loved the opening half. Extremely well done, even the 2nd half, BUT ONLY if they start the Fleming novels from the very beginning and in their proper order with same cast (since they re-did CASINO ROYALE with Daniel Craig, which was extremely well done, both in adaption and updating from the original Fleming novel -- the first movie SHOULD be LIVE AND LET DIE)... Skyfall really finalized the pre Bond-by-Fleming books very well. Updating the story, adapting the novel, and, I think, with a strong eye to the passion within the Fleming's novels -- Daniel Craig may not have black hair, but HE IS BOND.
B007SNMYNS|5.0|If you think you have the discipline to eliminate all grains from your diet -- wheat, oats, almost all rice, yes even quinoa -- and to eat low carb, then you might benefit tremendously from the wheat belly diet. Try it for a week and see what happens.<br /><br />I needed to lose a few pounds. The weight loss strategies I had been using for thirty years had now failed. Out of frustration I looked through the Wheat Belly book and when I saw that it said to cut out oatmeal, it became obvious: my daily bowls of oatmeal were the culprit. I just knew it.<br /><br />In one week of the wheat belly diet I lost the few pounds that months of calorie counting and extra exercise couldn't shake off.<br /><br />As the weeks went by and I kept losing pounds, what became clear was that the wheat belly diet isn't only about losing weight.<br /><br />If you're somehow sensitive to wheat, or to whatever else you're cutting out, various ailments start to clear up. I'm seeing lifelong ailments disappear: asthma, eczema, sinus problems, stomach problems, dental problems (yeah no kidding, I'm shocked), sleep quality. My sensitivity to caffeine has even gone away and I have no idea why. It's like every week a new disorder or sensitivity is corrected. I feel like I'm being reborn, re-youthed, in a way. Blood pressure is down, I can go 7 or 8 hours without eating, I no longer nap during the day, I stay mentally alert throughout more of the day, psychological cravings and habits have lost much energy.<br /><br />For me, the wheat belly low carb way of eating is proving to be a powerful tool for well-being.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This film won 4 academy awards and deserved them all - especially in cinematography!  It is very psychological and \\"eye candy\\" to watch.  I've watched it twice and know I will watch it more in the future. - F. Parker
0062200909|5.0|This book went beyond expectations.  This book is my favorite book, because it showed how each carachter was developed as well as the behind the scenes details.  I love it.  I have always loved details on movies and how they were created, this book answered it. I highly reccomend this book if you love details.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I received it, and it is really in such amazing shape for a used copy. Love it, love it, love it!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is so addictive!  But I love it and it keeps your mind going all the time.  Then you find yourself trying to beat the clock all the time!  My best time so far is just below 4 minutes!  Of course, now I'm trying to beat that time!  Again, very addictive but I love it!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is pretty good, I'm 14 and I play this game with my friend sometimes. But This game is more of a Time-passer then anything else in my opinion. But for younger kids I'm sure they would love it.

B00BI6SSMC|2.0|First let me start by saying that I have been an Iron and Wine fan since the Creek Drank the Cradle.  Beam has a great voice and has always been a great song writer. I am also all for artists growing and expanding their sound - sometimes it makes a good band great and sometimes it can turn something great into something that's just ok.  For Beam and Iron and Wine, I feel that they have unfortunately fallen trap to the later. On the Shepard's dog, he started moving away from the Iron and Wine sound that I love - it was still a good album but not his best.  When Kiss Each Other Clean came out, it was a drastic step in another direction - yet, even with that album I was able to find it strong enough as a whole.  There were a few awful songs on it but there were enough solid tracks for me to accept the album.  With Ghost on Ghost, Iron and Wine has continued with a sound that is nothing like the earlier albums.  As mentioned above, for some bands this can be a great thing but for Iron and Wine it has completely ruined a good thing.  Don't get me wrong, this album could be good if you stripped out the band or changed the band to something more folky - but with the band and it's current sound, the songs are just simply annoying.  For me, this album conjures up images of the loveboat or some cheesy, run down lounge in Reno.  Unless Beam shifts back to what made Iron and Wine great to begin with, it's safe to say this is the last I&W album I will purchase - and that's something I never thought I would say.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|This is a movie that I enjoyed because it captured the insecurities of 40 year olds really well.  This is not a movie to be watched with your kids.  It is a good movie to watch if you are ready to laugh at yourself!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway suffers is the most fun game I have ever played. It is so good I cant put it down.
0674059719|5.0|Don't be fooled by the cover - it doesn't begin to tell the story. This is a gorgeous oversized edition (measuring 9\\" x 10\\" x 2\\") with an elegant choice of typefaces, filled with color plates, letters written by Louisa and her publisher Thomas Niles and commentary on each page which enhances the reading experience. Shealy introduces the book with an interesting essay about the extensive revisions made to the text between its original publication in 1868 and the revised version in the 1880s. In many respects the revisions were a response to negative criticism about the slang Alcott used throughout the book being a poor example for children! Fortunately Shealy uses the original text which is more vibrant and real. A second essay includes photos of each of the main players from the Alcott family. Alcott drew from the deep well of her personal life to bring Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, Marmee and Laurie to life. Shealy includes analysis of the era, fascinating anecdotes and great trivia.  If you love Little Women, you will want this edition as a keepsake to pass down to children and grandchildren.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|This was a great premise for a movie, but the story line fell short.  Not sure what would have made it better, but I was not very disappointed.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The author is brutally honest about her challenges and her growth. I loved this book because it brings home the often forgotten truth that to find yourself you need to go outside and live in the &#34;real world&#34; in nature - not the world most of us inhabit.
B001NHNG64|3.0|The story is entertaining. The relationship that is fostered seems pretty forced to the point of being ridiculous in some parts. Overall a satisfying but forgettable novel. Good enough to pass the time at an airport but not enough to recommend to a friend.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I like the style in which this was written.  I was constantly amused at the colorful language and sarcasm of the main character who was stuck on a planet all alone. About the only thing I felt was rushed was the ending. It seemed to wrap up far too quick. But, other than that, I totally enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to read it every time I could.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|It is a classic and by far the best! Lot's of laughs and a movie that we watch every year.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy these games and fun to play. I look forward to unlocking more games to play to see what other ones there are.

B004C00EM8|2.0|The first part of this movie is interesting. Thing actually happen.<br /><br />Then it switches gears, into neutral. It gets boring, really boring, then tiring to watch.<br /><br />Then only good part about the ending is it's over and you can get on with your life.

B00A3DZ61W|2.0|Used to like this game quite a bit. Now I have deleted it because of the stupid amount of adverts. Both inscreen and between screens. Totally ruined. Yes I now I could avoid adverts by using a blocker or buying it but thats not the point. When I forst got it the level was tolerable now it is not.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Saw the concert on tv and it was our first exposure to Joe's music.  WOW, awesome guitar playing and singing by him and the supporting band is very well versed and varied in instrumentation!  This was a fabulous album, love it in the car for car trips as you aren't going to fall asleep to this one as your toes will be tapping and your hands clapping out rythms as you listen!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Probably the best of this type of game that I tried...don't mean much but I hate to waste time so I am suprised when igames are described as a way to kill time. However, I find it a good way to destress for 5 mins during intense work periods.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Hard to put out of mind that each of the main characters in this story were responsible for the deaths of hundreds - if not thousands - of their enemies and they did so at the ripe-old-age of 20-something.  What Franz and Charlie went through in a single week - let alone an entire war - brings to mind why indeed theirs was the Greatest Generation.  The book is well written and provides fascinating historical insight into the German Luftwaffe and many of Germany's greatest fighter pilots as well as their acrid relationship with the Nazi leadership that took power in Germany in 1933.  The story itself unbelievable - amazing.  Do NOT miss this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game you can jump over things and win metals.also you take care of a horse and some other things you would do with a real horse.
B001N4OX82|4.0|If you are interested in the Trojan War or the Illiad, this is a must see. Overall, the direction, acting, fight scenes, and costumes are impeccable.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is a good read. He tries to help the skeptics understand what he went through. He just reiterated what believers already know. Read it and he describes a place that is truly beyond words.
1451695195|4.0|This book is well worth reading. I shared it with my brother who is a neuro scientist, as well<br />It is thought provoking, sensible, and written for everyone to understand.<br />I wish it had explored in depth Eben's change of heart.<br />An excellent read, though.

B005HSL626|3.0|This game is fun and enjoyable.  I found it somewhat challenging, but I am not very big on games.  I was drawn to check it out because of a television commercial.  I wanted to see what it was all about.
B00BGI076M|1.0|There is so much to say about this television show and I'm not sure I can cover it all, none of which is good. The only good thing about the show is that they managed to cast Kevin Bacon in it and he is usually a guaranteed sign of quality. I take that back, there is something else that is good about the show; the premise of it. The first two episodes of \\"The Following\\" are promising in the sheer sense that the show COULD have great promise. A serial killer. A back story. A detective with a history and a relationship with the serial killer's wife. A serial killer who can commit crimes from prison due to a cult following of psychos. All of these great ideas are squandered.<br /><br />The reasons why these ideas are squandered is, in my opinion, for one simple reason: \\"The Following\\" is trying to be \\"24\\". In an effort to be relentless, non-stop, intense action and thrills, \\"The Following\\" throws an event at you every five minutes. Therefore, instead of being intelligently fleshed out, it is hastily fleshed out. Every five minutes the show opens itself up for continuous ridicule for stupid teenage criminals, stupid FBI agents who should have known better, criminals who aren't tracked or followed, or just plain illogical assumption story archs. Instead of the creators doing some research and giving us a reason to think that Joe Carroll (the serial killer) is brilliant, we are left to just assume so.<br /><br />Instead of being intelligently thought out, the show relies upon gimmicks; murderers who don't murder but talk, murderers who have no reason to leave someone alive but do because that person isn't supposed to die yet, victims explaining why the murderer didn't kill them, \\"He said he didn't kill me because a live hostage would slow you down more than a dead one.\\"  Oh, he did huh? Well that was nice of him.... thanks for the info. A detective held by three teenage murderers whittling through his ropes with a hidden knife and they don't see it despite all of them standing ten feet away. Then you have a serial killer who just calls the detective pretty much every episode and has a nice chat and tells him how screwed he is.<br /><br />Mainly though, the \\"24\\"ish format to the show asks the creators to explain escapes and FBI blunders every five minutes and after about 10 of those, or two episodes, the gimmick is over. Then when it continues, the show becomes eye-roll boring and has absolutely zero tension. The tension has no intelligence to it. There is zero tact to the show. Where a show like \\"CSI\\" would take the time to explain some of the reasoning or how things happened or worked, \\"The Following\\" doesn't have time for that, and when it does, the explanation is ridiculous.<br /><br />Nobody should be giving this show 5-stars in my opinion. NOBODY. This is not a great show. Nowhere close. Is it a terrible show, like my 1-star suggests? I think so. Maybe that is too harsh. Yet when I see a show that has so much promise and lucky people are making MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to entertain us and they give us something that absolutely ANYBODY with basic writing skills could write, you can't be too harsh. When the writers and directors have zero TACT or make no attempt to be intelligent in their tact, but just give you every horror/thriller cliche in the book and expect you to drool and return every week.  No thanks. 1-star baby. That's what you get for your lack of effort.nding ten feet away.

0767817664|5.0|This was a gift.  Person said it was terrific, just what he wanted.  Has both older and newer versions and had to have both.  No complaints, so evidently good pix, clear, good sound, etc.<br />Cecy Ivie
B009FZHYKU|4.0|We're in love with this show but this season could've been better. It became tiring watching battles between the prison and Woodbury. We missed the zombie battles! Yes it was a change of pace but it wasn't enthralling enough to last an entire season. Kudos to the writers for getting fans to hate the governor but then that hate turned into annoyance and episodes dedicated solely to him were a turn off. Still TWD is amazing and one of our favorite shows. We cannot wait until next season. Hopefully the governor will be killed off (gruesomely) once and for all!
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Have wanted this movie for years.  It was everything I expected.  Heston terrific as always, and so was Sophia Loren.  Marvelous acting.  Good color and sound, clear pictures, no &#34;black-outs&#34; in pix and no skipping.  Would recommend to anyone.  Loved it.<br />Cecy Ivie
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect for the price but this is a really nice bag. It had lots of room until I put all my stuff in it. I like the straps inside to hold you camera in place and the outside straps to carry tripod or in my case a monopod.

The Hobbit is an admirable attempt to stay true to the written version in a reasonable time frame. I cannot say enough good things about this product and look forward to the next installments to complete my collection.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|The extras on this are well-worth the cost.  Hearing the way the movie developed over a three year period, and the creative work that went into fleshing out the story was quite riveting.  LOVE it.

It was a big eye opener for me and it has changed my views for the better in many areas of health and nutrition.<br />It's also an easy read, so if you have heard about the whole30, but are still unsure..read it because it doesn't take long and you can see for yourself.<br />Some parts in the book are a little lengthy on explanation, but if you aren't interested in it, the author tells you where to skip ahead :)<br />GOOD LUCK if you try a whole 30!!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|OUTSTANDING. The DVD is almost like seeing the band live. I have watched it several times and it is currently on loan to some great Eagles fans.

B00ANDPGJE|4.0|The DVDs were double sided and not well transferred. These discs are a lot more convenient, with clearer subtitles and a noticeable lift in both sound and picture although this is not a full restoration. A great set and at the right price this should be a very good buy.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book, I bought on a whim, but I must say it is one of the best books I've read!  It made me laugh so hard which brought great joy, but it also made me sad and angry. How could people claiming to represent God be so inhumane?  Those sections of the book brought to mind the movie, The Magdalene Sisters. On the other hand, the humorous parts reminded me of The Waking of Ned Devine!
B009S33I68|4.0|While reading this book I felt like I was living and in effect experiencing this beginning of modern era  airborne warfare. Understanding the political realities that moved us forward to this type of intervention, and the classic mistakes, also politically driven, of not ensuring that those who had all the training would stay together for the events, rather than having the ranks depleted by removing short timers, was once again shocking.  Having lost close friends during this war, and having struggled with my own ambivalent feelings during this war, I found I could only read the vivid and graphic descriptions of the combat experiences for relatively short periods of time, without having to pause and dry my eyes, and recollect my thoughts.  I am again impressed by the valor and heroism of so many of our American soldiers under fire. But was also impressed by the respect given to our then &#34;Enemies&#34; by the authors.  Being able to see the battles from their perspective, as well as from ours, was most enlightening. I am left, once again, questioning the need for this type of engagement (war), and wondering if we can ever differentiate a &#34;right war&#34; from a &#34;wrong war&#34;.
0670023329|5.0|It seems odd to rate &#34;I love it&#34; for such a sad story, however I would buy the book again as a reminder of just how lucky I have been in my life.

I called my brother up and he said I told you so!
0385349947|5.0|I felt like she as talking to me and detailing all of the things I have done and didn't even realize.  It is a brilliant look at gender in the work place and at home.  Society needs to make some changes and she puts all of that on the table to be talked about.  READ IT!
B005HEVBGG|5.0|It is great to be able to see these episodes.  I cannot find Voyager on an television station, cable or antenna.  I can hook up my laptop to my large screen television with an HDMI cable.  The picture quality is great and in or equal to hi-def.  And they are free to view for Amazon Prime members such as myself.  Thank you Amazon for making these great programs available.  There are also all the other Star Trek episodes from the original series, The Next Generation, Star Trek Enterprise and Deep Space Nine as well as a host of other programs such as Battlestar Galactica and Stargate.  I hope that they will all be available for a long time to come.  I mainly use my Prime membership to get free 2-day shipping, but if I did not have that, it would be worth the $80 per year just to get all of the free television programs and movies.  It is much less expensive than cable; and for new movies, the rentals are in a good price range.  Though I like the older television programs and movies the best.

B00AFOS6P2|4.0|Nick Cave's lyrics can sometimes make me feel inept, just as some wonderful poetry by the Masters can make me feel like it is beyond my grasp.  Push the Sky Away is a beautiful work.  However, just as I can often enjoy a poem that I don't fully grasp, I immensely enjoy this album.  Sonically, it is mesmerizing.  And, again, the words have a beauty all their own.
B008OUTQ6C|3.0|I brought this CD for a single and had hoped that their were more songs on the CD I could relate too, enjoy and relax too.  This fell a little short, but the song I brought the CD for is great.
006621131X|5.0|you do not have to be a music fanatic to enjoy this amazing work by Pattie Smith.  there is a reason why she won various awards for this work that were not limited to the music industry.  it captures a magical time in her life, mapplethorpe's life, and New York's history.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|without a doubt, one amazing game. The levels are creative, and just the right difficulty. Say you need to populate a planet. You can get a observant gift wrapped president, a giant striped policeman, and a invincible citizen with a maroon gown. The choice is yours entirely! There's also a super fun sandbox mode, where you can do just about anything. Well worth the dollar. I recommend it to anyone with an imagination.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|It was worth the wait.  It is wonderful to be surprised by the veteran rockers!  Just when you think there is nothing left to say, a guy like Joe Walsh comes out with a remarkable work that rocks hard, has tenderness as well, and also makes you feel like you are getting to know the guy at the same time.  He is very invested in his work and it shows; you can hear it.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Great movie- no slow parts, exciting the entire time. This is the kind of movie you could watch serveral times and not be bored.
B0000028W9|5.0|a great artist always has a little bit of prophet in him.  mr. Cohen just happens to have a whole lot of prophet in him.  he make s the future seem horrifying, humorous, and beautifully musical all at the same time.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A well-created and believeable creation of a possible future world. Well written and well read! A bargain at the price--
B0025VLELQ|5.0|I purchased this Blu-ray to share with my family, a great story that i remember as a child.  The picture quality is much better than i remember!  I would highly recommend this item!
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|The slow start (within the first two minutes) is misleading to a point.  This movie bursts into action and never stops.  It is hilarious, but mind-boggling with one thinks about how government could be operating (and probably is).  I loved the characters, the flash moves from scene to scene, the relationship between the characters and most of all, I loved the portrayal of \\"older folks\\" getting the best of the younger generation.  I have watched this repeatedly, on television as well as the DVD.  It is simply awesome.  Ready and waiting for Red 2.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This like all of Josh's CD's is terrific. I highly reacommend it to everyone.  Very beautiful CD. . Josh does a great job.
B000B589JI|1.0|I really liked the idea of having extra fuel handy as I do not use my lighter often and so when I need it I generally find it out of fuel. This is not a solution though. The threads for the fuel chamber were not cut long enough. This results in it not sealing at all. It does not just &#34;leak&#34; fuel pours out of it because you cannot tighten it enough to make a seal. I now have cute little canister for something, but it does not come anywhere near what it needed to contain a liquid.
B00947N6D8|4.0|My daughter and I watched this movie on Easter for the first time! We both absolutely loved the movie! We have probably watched it 20 times since Easter!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Glad to be able to enjoy the craft and cinematography of the movie again.  It adds another dimension to the story.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|So addicting ! I have to play it everyday ,it's so much fun ! I love the new updates , I hope it doesn't get to the point where you have to pay . I love the challenges ! (:
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I'd like this very much , a very useful stuff to download to ease finding important topic/video that was downloaded in youtube.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I was entertained from start to finish. Loved the characters. Definitely worth the read!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Arrived just as expected. Shipped timely. And product was awesome! Thanks<br /><br />Great to work with.<br /><br />Recmd to all who want a good product.
0060899220|5.0|I dig it.  A must for any chef student. Tell it like it is Tony.  No reservations about this one.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is one of the great movies of the 70s.  I watch it annually.  I used to have it on VHS and wore it out.  Now with the DVD, I'll resume my annual viewing routine.  The music is great; the story is terrific; the acting just marvelous.
1609611543|5.0|I am shouting this from all rooftops:  EVERY CITIZEN ON THE PLANET NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK. Once you have read your copy, please pass it on to others.
B000JCQCW4|1.0|The entire story could have been summed up in 20 minuets but was dragged out for almost 2 hours. This movie was a waste of time.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The combination of a story of redemption along with great music and great acting make this a life changing experience!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I found myself asking the question  &#34; why am I continuing to read this book when I find it so disturbing&#34;. Frankly it kept drawing me into the characters which were beautifully developed and then on to the bazaar and inevitable conclusion.
0143122061|5.0|If you think that ideas matter, this is the book for you.  It is fairly easy to write about what happened, but much more interesting to read about why things happened.  His insights have helped me put the last 500 years of history in a context that explains many things well.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I really enjoy this game it brings me back from my childhood. Yes there are things you can buy from the cs but I am progressing and have only spent 5bucks
B00ANW33CM|2.0|Instructions are vague which leaves the player confused. Take too much time figuring out game then playing. Might try again later.
B009JZ5FO8|5.0|I purchased this item for a gift for a bridal shower that we put together for the bride.  it was perfect, as she is wearing pink shoes and has pink flowers, etc.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very detailed and complete. Maps if you want them. I like it for checking what the forecast is for the week.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Expected more.  It started great, and seemed to get bogged down some place in the middle.  Not realy liking the way it finished off at the end.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|I will try to stay away from using adapter as much as I can....but this particular one seems sturdy right out of the box.....the cables are a little ticker compare to similar adapters and the overall materials seem to be of a better quality.....I will defenitly get more if needed.
1449410243|3.0|I was excited to find this book and actually bought 3 of them. There were funny parts, however overall not impressed. The office cat cartoon is really not that funny. The best part with the best jokes is the pull out part.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|not much really to report...epic game. a definite must get if your into this kind of game. but not worth buying the in game currency. too little bang for your buck.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I am usually not the type that goes all crazy about a show, however I could actually watch a BBT marathon. So far I have all of the 5 seasons, and am about to buy season six. The shows direction did change, but I like the development.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|This is a really fun game for the whole family. My seven year old son loves it and my three year old daughter also likes to play it. I can also admit that I enjoy this game. It is the same basic style of the other jumping games, but with Sonic instead. I have been a fan of Sonic games ever since I was younger and played it on the Sega Genesis. This is a great addition to the collection of Sonic games.
B006LSZECO|2.0|As an avid reader especially of mysteries, I found Gone Girl to be very contrived with an illogical and unoriginal format and with stereotypes abounding.  As a person born and bred in New York City who has spent considerable time in the rural Midwest, I felt that the author really had no idea of what life there is like.  Perhaps she should have spent some time in that locale researching how the inhabitants really behave.  The only good things that I found in the book was that it was grammatically written and did provide an occasionally true insight into human behavior.  Perhaps those who enjoyed it should spend some time exploring some carefully crafted and well thought out mysteries by authors such as P.D. James and Agatha Christie.  Then they would understand the difference between a good mystery and garbage.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I love this game because it is so much fun! It continually challenges you with tougher tracks and keeps you on you toes. It is so much fun and I never pay anything. You can earn coins for more tracks just by playing some tracks over again.
B000I5SY9Q|4.0|This film depicts an era of broadcast television during the 70s and 80s that will never come again. I liked the work of the casting company and the sets because they seemed to fit the times and places depicted very well. As is the case with villains, if you hate them, they are doing their jobs. Production, direction, music, continuity, all well done, I thought.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is the best film I've seen in years.  A beautiful story in which two unlikely friends change each other's lives forever.  Sounds cheesy when I describe it, but this is one movie that's worth watching!!!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Perfect to have when you need to find that right note in choir!  A must have when you're in a jam.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved this version. The high rope swinging and train car riding gave it that extra bit of excitement it needed. The only flaw I find in this game is that we never escape. I believe different levels would increase the fun. As it is the same path over and over loses interest after time.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Don't download this product without reading about it first!!!  Has it's nose in everything you do! I learned by mistake but wound up removing it from my device. I will be more careful in the future about things such as this!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My four year old boy absolutely loves this game and can't stop talking about the animals he catches and hatches. The mini game driving the car is a nice change as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Tradition is what I like most and this game has it! I love how it works where you just touch the card you want to move and it puts it in place for you. Traditional desktop games you have to drag it there but this one does the work for you!  Much fun to play!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This trilogy was fascinating and fast paced.  The characters continually surprised and impressed me.  Clever and very well written!  Worth reading more than once.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It was a good book but a tad lengthy with lots of detail but that's to be expected with a King book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|SOOO  much fun, many levels, and different programs.  Keeps me busy for hours.  Colorful, challenging, free, no more words, have fun
B000SLP4SE|4.0|The movie has a cool beginning and it stars Mark Waghlberg who never fails at making a movie action packed, dramatic with some humor thrown into the mix. It's not the best movie ever but it's good enough to make you not get up from a movie that is two hours long.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|Probably would've given the movie four stars if the blu ray had some halfway decent bonus features. For $23 I think we at least deserve a simple ten minute feature with the actors talking about the story, their characters and the experience of working with Tarantino. Instead all we get are three fairly lame mini docs on the stunt work, production and costume design. If we want anything more we have to fall for the production company's blatant extortion attempt by spending an extra seven dollars for the special edition copy at Best Buy. That's offensive to me.<br /><br />The movie itself is entertaining in the way that a Subway sandwich is a fulfilling meal. It tastes pretty good and puts a smile on your face, but it's easily forgotten and devoid of any real substance. This is just a standard Quentin Tarantino movie with a different setting. Take Kill Bill or Inglourious Basterds and transplant them to the pre-civil war era American South and you've got Django Unchained. No real attempt on Tarantino's part to stretch his limits as a filmmaker or a storyteller. Just more of the same from his previous efforts: dark comedy, \\"witty\\" dialogue and gratuitous violence working together in the pursuit of fairly shallow, popcorn-movie entertainment. Unfortunately many of his previous films have dark comedy which is funnier, witty dialogue that's wittier and gratuitous violence that's far more creative. If you're a diehard Tarantino fan, you'll probably love it. If you're looking for something more from a director with his kind of talent, then you'll probably be a little disappointed.<br /><br />Unlike Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, this is a movie that no one will be talking about in 20 years.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|A classic treasure. (I don't have time to come up with ttwenty or less additio0nal words for something so perfect)
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Led Zeppelin Live in London!  Some of the best music of the last 40 years.<br />Let's hope that this will be continued in 2014.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|If you're into books that can relate to your life and/or books that will keep you laughing hysterically, I'm pretty sure this book will entertain you. I, myself, have read this whole book once, after that, if I had spare time, I'd be rereading this book all the time!<br />Another successful book made by Jeff Kinney.<br /><br />Good job Jeff!
B007N31XTY|5.0|Naomi Watts and Adrian Brody are excellent leads in this blockbuster type movie. Jack Black, not so much. i think the special effects are still stunning and effective, but the love story and the many excellent supporting roles among the crew members keep this movie a step ahead.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is perfect because it shows the time, the date, and the weather. BUY THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a great app.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The storyline keep you moving through the book although at times I may have been slightly bored, just slightly because I couldn't figure out where the story line was going.  I was thinking is this it? Is this all? Until the book started to twist and turn, that's when I couldn't put it down!
B004U8VUUC|4.0|After reading some pretty bad reviews, my expectations were low, but I have to say I enjoyed it.  Held my attention the whole time.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Although Mr. Child's books are a bit formulaic, this was one of the better ones, and thanks for no gratuitous sex this time.  Reacher shouldn't always nail the smartest woman in the book!
B007K8ILTW|5.0|Great re-release of Kubrick's early work. A nice addition to any classic director series. Glad that this DVD has been reissued
B0065GC0PG|5.0|My mom lent me this book and I flew through it. A great alternative to the traditional Cinderella story line.
B00AEBB932|5.0|This movie is a classic we all love.  The DVD was great, clear picture, good sound.  It's great for the entire family!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this app! I love how you can change the pieces and how you can only see the edges at the click of a button!
B004LWZVZM|3.0|Typical Redford playing with the facts.  It was really well photographed and for the most part well acted.  However, one should read the Assassin's Accomplice to see most of the facts regarding this trial and movie about it.  When about to be hanged she nearly fainted - not in the movie.  She also moaned &#34;Don't let me drop, don't let me drop.&#34;  I don't mind a movie about Mary Surrat but put all the facts out there and let the viewer make up his or her mind.  From now on I will avoid all Redford's movies.
B00BF11STU|3.0|This is an OK story.  They try and make you believe that this is the real story, but it falls short.
B0053O89XI|4.0|While I still love the show, season five was, for me, not quite as good as previous seasons... which, by the way, still makes it head and shoulders above everything else on network TV.
B0082XJGRK|4.0|This book really got me thinking about my life and it gets really deep, but it does get confusing so you really need a deep understanding of literature
B001XV1X6A|3.0|The story was a little silly, but it was entertaining if you like Brendan Fraiser, I'm sure younger children will love it
B000MCIBE8|5.0|I had bought this for my husband.  He is a fan of music from the 60's.  The DOORS are among his favorites.
B000FCK9D6|5.0|There are just some novels that I like to read over and over.  This is one of them.  Like seeing and old friend and talking over old times.  There is nothing new, nothing surprising, but a warm and familier feeling that is so good over a cup of tea, in a comfortable chair.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I love the whole STAR TREK family.  I have all three seasons of STAR TREK : TOS. It set the pace for the rest of the Star Trek family.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|A whole book with just one plot element.  Life in a small lifeboat with a tiger.  There's just a limit to what you say, and how many times you can say it before it becomes ho-hum.
B00062IDCO|5.0|I love any and all of the different Star Trek shows, Voyager is no exception.  Capt. Janeway was wonderful.  She held onto her guns.
B009HNDTPO|5.0|Criminal minds is such a good show. Watching it on amazon was quick and easy. Can't wait to watch more episodes.
B00B5HQL50|2.0|The previous Bond character was more accurate, more capable in hand to hand combat,  To me, this man's physical ability seemed far beyond what his physical stature could deliver, therefore rather unbalanced.  Perhaps I am somewhat spoiled by the Bond of &#34;Dr. No&#34; and &#34;Thunderball.&#34;
B005PK1G76|5.0|A fraction of the price of the actual britax ones.  Serves the same purpose but does it better.  Recommend highly.
B005MELQ0M|5.0|I bought this book for my new grandson.  We are  starting him out with many books to read.  The movie is one of my son's favorites, so it was only fitting that my grandson have this book to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I live playing temple run games. This game reminds me of playing temple run. I love the fast moving actions in these games.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love the possiblilities and wonder where the next season will take me! I was invested in all the characters and it has kept me on the edge of my seat! Would recommend to anyone that enjoys the strange and the unexpected!
B0084B5TK8|1.0|the quality of the print of the book was fine, it was the story i hated. No redeeming value to the gore
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I can listen to this music anytime, working out or studying or at work.  It is really beautiful and has a great beat and tempo so it doesn't put you to sleep!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a fun game but it needs in creative:mods,day,night,and let you craft in it plus more cows!!!!! how do they expect use to make leather armorial if there's no cows.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Excellent ;D<br /><br />Multi CD jewel cases suck though. They always get damaged. Just opening and closing it and crack, plastic breaking
0307987698|5.0|This is a very fun book. My five year old and two year old both love it!  They want to read it all the time.
B009ZUKY52|4.0|I purchased this after I purchased the [[ASIN:B00466HM28 Akai Pro MPK Mini 25-Key Ultra-Portable USB MIDI Keyboard Controller]] and found I want/need more/bigger keys.<br />I love the size of this controller. Since all controls are at the top, above the keys, the device is as slim as possible from left to right. This does, of course, mean the device is a bit larger front-to-back than other controllers ( [[ASIN:B0038YX3BS Alesis Q49 49-Key USB MIDI Keyboard Controller]] for instance), so if you are worried about desktop real-estate in that department, this may be a problem for you.<br /><br />I did a bit of research, including reviews here on Amazon, and decided I really wanted the Direct-Link feature for Cubase. This is where the product lost a star. I followed the directions, which say to install the drivers (optionally) and then install the direct link for cubase program which will map the slider, buttons and knobs to cubase for you. Then the direction walk you through adding a midi controller in devices to finish up. Unfortunately, there is now a bug in the latest directlink (1.1.6) available from the website that, when following their directions, you get now sound from the DAW. Turns out to be a documented bug [...] so searching for an older version of the directlink for cubase fixed this for me.<br /><br />I will also address the Avid Ignite review below now: This software is finally available for download[...]so this is no longer an issue. I haven't tried it yet, since I have Cubase and Reason already, but there it is. That was unfortunate that so many people were without a DAW that was supposed to be included with the device at no cost.<br /><br />Since I use this mostly in Cubase 5, I will talk about its usefulness there. I love the ability to control which track I am working on with a quick tap on the track selector, and that I can mute specific tracks easily as well. I also make frequent use of the transport controls as well. Unfortunately, I am disappointed with the response of the sliders in Cubase. As one review I read mentions, if you want to make a small adjustment to a track, you are out of luck. This is because, for some reason, you need to move the slider a great deal, and fast, before the adjustment is noticed by Cubase. Keep this in mind if you are just as interested in the sliders as the keys and other controls. You need to get used to how they work, and chances are, if you are trying to write to the volume track with them, you will be unsatisfied.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great device with great feel and versatility. I don't miss the drum pads the Akai had.
B00C4SUEJI|5.0|Any Iron & Wine fans considering this album should be aware that this is not \\"indie folk.\\" It's highly produced pop with horns, piano, and lots of slick backing vocals. It's sort of like \\"Kiss Each Other Clean\\" but more laid back. I think Sam is a master of creating great vocal melodies, writing interesting lyrics, and finger picking the most wicked acoustic guitar melodies! Unfortunately his acoustic guitar seems to be gathering dust these days. I hope in the future he will get back to the wonderful simplicity of just guitar/voice/vocals but even if he does I will still listen to and enjoy this classy and mature album. As I listen to this latest version of the I&W sound I can't help but hear echoes of John Lennon's music from the late 70's. Does anyone else hear it, too?
B000LXH0AY|5.0|Feel in love with the broadway music although I never saw that version. Although a few of the songs are a little different I still love it!
1476733953|5.0|Honestly I have always been a fan of fantasy/science-fiction because it presents a world that I have no chance of being a part of. I have read countless of these two genres and I will have to say this is without a doubt one of my favorites. I went out on a limb and bought this book without recommendation besides what o had seen on Amazon. From the first part onward I could not put it down, nothing I expected played out the way I saw it in my head. I would definitely recommend this book, it goes so much deeper then just another fiction book. Deception, deceit, and straight control play huge roles. I will be reading the rest of the series immediately
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Ok, so there wasn't much back story. And there wasn't much character development. All you need to know about this movie to know what's going on, is that the main character has something to fight for, and the villain is as sick, and rutheless as they come. Leave all that other stuff to imagination. Cause I tell ya, what they did with this one is absolutly astounding. I had heard that this was a good one but truly didn't know what I was in for. What I got was one of the most gritty, brutaly violent, awesomly choreographed martial arts movies I seen in a long time. And I just had given this same credit to Universal Soldier:Day of Reckoning. But that movie has got nothing on this one. When they<br />fell through the floor and one of the<br />henchmen gets three to the face at close<br />range,I knew I was in for some ish. Iko is one of the best I've seen since Jaa, with an extra notch because the boy has got screen presence. He plays a role I would like to see Tony play, but he can't, not because he can't act, but because he can't play anybody but himself on screen.(ok maybe that might constitute as can't act)but any way I can't wait to see where this freakin kid goes next. Another thing I loved about this movie is everybody was sick with the Silat! It wasn't just \\"oh he's better than everybody\\", he actually had a hard time! But any way ' nuff said. I wish I would have just bought it instead of renting it cause it certainly is collection worthy.
B000FCKC4M|5.0|Paulo is such an interesting person, author, and soul. Within his writing lays such stories and adventures that keep you reading and never wanting to put it down and return to the real world.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I fell in love with them thru PBS and have been held in awe of their talents ever since. Awesome!

B007U4DIM6|5.0|Cute and entertaining movie for kids of all ages.  Love the little dogs!  Recommend for any dog lover for sure!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't really like it.  Nothing but sex and torture.  I thought it might be something more, but it isn't.  I won't be buying the next book.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me guessing until the very end.<br />Don't usually like books that go from one character to another for each chapter, but this worked<br />very well.
1476717567|5.0|This was a great read.  I always enjoy her books and she did not disappoint!  Can't wait for her next one!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A very Beautifully made movie~ Very thought provoking & i will watch it again. Loved that tiger.. an amazing story!~~:)
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Lengthy book full of history and interesting characters. The details make the book move slowly. I haven't finished it yet but I'm glad I can refer to it when I have some downtime.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The story tells so much about how cruel some people can be.  It shows what a person can endure and survive.  I would recommend this book.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|The movie plot was fine but the file did not have 5.1 audio. I plan on sticking with Blu-ray discs for best quality movies.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I´m kind of a fan of all BBC literature productions, but I think this one is one of the best. I really recommend it.
B009NX2XA0|5.0|Really good movie so is Rio Bravo.  Saw 1st time @ drive-in as a kid<br />Classic John Wayne flick.  Thought he was best in the 60's
B006MW3V6U|3.0|i can't find this to view it, where is it, how do i find it, still waiting to view this item
B00957T6X6|3.0|I have to agree with the other people who have rated this book that it is hard to navigate this single book. It would have been better off to have this purchase as separate downloads.
B003Z49LYO|1.0|Just when you thought it was getting good, it turned bad. Her parents were mean to her and the girls made fun of her. When her she finally got married her husband heard she was raped he left her. It just got worse for her again.  The end was terrible.  I wouldn't recommended this movie to any one.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Thank you so much we have enjoyed the programe. Hope to see more of this series. The dvd was in very good condition and on time.
B000002LIM|5.0|Before the late 80's if you were to think of Batman and Music a beach party surf-like tune would pop into your head with a horn section that made you sing, &#34;Batman! dun dun, dun dun, dun dun, dun dun, Batman!&#34;. When Tim Burton followed up Beetlejuice with Batman he brought Danny Elfman along with him and Elfman rewrote the book on the score and sound that was Batman.<br /><br />Prior to this it was Superman that had the iconic Superhero Theme. &#34;Batman&#34; introduced yet another musical hook that stood up to [John] Williams' Man of Steel score. Over 20 years later its the score that set the tone for Batman. Following the film a few years later Danny Elfman was asked to do the song intro for &#34;Batman: The Animated Series&#34; which echoed the film's main score. It is this film's score that &#34;Lego: Batman&#34; saw fit to use as their backdrop for game-play music. The likes of [Hans] Zimmer's score for the Nolan films, the games and animated movies that followed would not have the same sound had this score not been done in the way that Elfman did it.<br /><br />Because Prince was also contracted to do a soundtrack that went along with the film I imagine it was written somewhere that Prince's album would get the same cover as the VHS. At first I thought, &#34;bummer,&#34; but then I took a look at the Score's CD cover. The iconic shot from the movie where the Batplane rises above the clouds to cast its silhouette against the moon is quite fitting for reflecting the tone of the movie and score.<br /><br />Each track is filled with mood that reflects the iconic imagery of the film. If you're a fan of the film and have seen it more times than you can count you'll hear tracks that are more than familiar to you but take the time to really listen to each one and admire it's compositional structure.<br /><br />While the inside sleeve doesn't have as big a fold out with as many pictures as the Prince album you do get a couple good shots, one being a closeup of Batman's face as he's driving the Batmobile, a shot exclusive to this album.<br /><br />A great quintessential addition for one who collects film scores and a must-own for Batfans everywhere.Batman's face as he's driving the Batmobile, a shot exclusive to this album.<br /><br />A great quintessential addition for one who collects film scores and a must-own for Batfans everywhere.
B000N3ST3Y|4.0|Genesis songs \\"everyone\\" should recognize: \\"Invisible Touch,\\" \\"Follow You Follow Me,\\" \\"Misunderstanding,\\" \\"Hold On My Heart\\"<br /><br />* Mostly second-era Genesis from the 1980s, the \\"Phil Collins years\\" fills this album<br /><br />* 18 tracks, digitally remastered, not all recognizable radio hits<br /><br />* Heavy on the synthesizer for these dramatic pop favorites<br /><br />Exceptions to the 1980s consistency of the album:<br /><br />* \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" is out-of-place, coming from the early 70s with its reggae style and featuring Peter Gabriel<br /><br />* \\"Congo\\" is from the post Phil collin years with a different serious rock flavor<br /><br />* \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" is a 1999 remake<br /><br />There is a box set that covers the Peter Gabriel years. This CD is designed for the casual fan or for the listener who wants an album with just the 80s radio hits (and a few of Genesis' last contributions in the 20th century).

B006WXHJGC|4.0|Russell Crowe has made a lot of movies, some I like some I don't.  I like the casting, the scenery, the growing romance with Marion keeping it a great historic adventure movie and not making it a romance movie.  It just hit me right.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I was reluctant to buy this when I read the bad reviews. I'm glad I bought it. In my opinion it is Diana's same beautiful sultry voice. Overall the DVD is very upbeat with still some very jazzy diana songs
B001EN71CW|4.0|The Actual show is AWESOME!!! but the back of the case was cracked all the way across. when I took them out of the bag.Discs were fine though.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I forced myself to finish, hated every minute of it and i am a voracious reader. I will read anything and buy into any story but this was the most frustrating group of characters, nothing redeeming about any of them. No one in my book club liked it. No one had anything good to say about it.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Todo excelente!, material de muy buena calidad, y los puertos quedan como deben de quedar. Full recomendado para los que tienen Mac!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|wesome thanks great movie and was on my doorstep tuesday when it was released to public .perfect. thanks again .
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very well written book.  Love the way it looks at multiple sides of the WW1 saga.  Would recommend this to any fan of the world wars.
0385349947|5.0|I loved it....it is an easy and fun read!  I highly recommend it to both men and women.  If you are in a leadership role or want to me, you need to read it.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Obviously they had to add more to the story to get 3 movies out of the original but I think they did it in a way that is true to Tolkein's original story.  looking forward to #2 and 3.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|My granddaughter and I both love Josh, so this was a great purchase. I preordered, so I got it the day it was released.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|Wayne Shorter never ceases to amaze. From his unique compositions to his choice of phrasing, he is truely a master. If you are a fan of the Wayne Shorter Quartet you will not be disappointed. They are just as adventurous as they always have been. Listen to it \\"without a net!\\" Love over Fear

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Everyone...well, almost everyone loves Angry Birds.  My grandson got me hooked on these little guys.  One of these days I may have to pop money for some of the other ones.  Oh dear...what is happening to my better judgment?  It's fun.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great game with tons of action .. this game is a must if your into strategy games. spent almost six hours playing  the first day..
B0073LWEXK|5.0|It was a little confusing in the beginning, but after I got the hang of it, I couldn't put it down! The graphics are excellent and the search for clues and pieces will get you hooked.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Chris Kyle had a great story to tell, but I didn't like the way he told it.  He has some great stories in the book, but then he would interject with trite commentary to the effect of:  &#34;...but that's just the kind of Texas cowboy that I am...&#34;.  I didn't think these sorts of first person comments about Chris politics, religion, etc were either interesting or necessary, and they detracted from the book.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|Wow! Gregory Porter is a great artist, I look forward to unique and soulful artist who give it their all. I have finally found an artist that does not sound like the typical artist on the scene...like homogenized and fluff with no substance.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|I love Richard castle!! I cant get enough of his work. such a great read I couldn't put it down thanks!!! super fast service too!!!
B000VK99Z6|4.0|Movie two in what is ultimately going to be a trio of movies from this pair directed by Edgar Wright.  While not quite as brilliant as Shaun of the Dead the ultimate understated zombie comedy, here they've taken a seeminly quiet award winning town and turned it into an unusual cop flick with a brilliantly funny action packed closing scene.  The chemistry between the two actors/friends and director is unmistakeable.  What I would give to be a fly on the wall on the set.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|I LOVE steel panther! and this was a must have for any Steel Panther fan! LOVE IT LOVE IT great price and fast shipping was a bonus!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love this CD! Every song on it is great and I can't stop listening to it! I think Carry On may be my favorite song on the CD.

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I needed this one to complete my collection. I received it fast and in good condition. We opened it and watched it and enjoyed ourselves.
B00BI6SSMC|2.0|I've been a fan of Sam Beam and Iron & Wine from the beginning... from that first appearance on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic. But, the previous album along with this new one - \\"Ghost on Ghost\\" - have departed enough from the original sound that it seems like Sam should rename the project... especially now that it is a full on band and not just himself. Other than \\"Low Light Buddy of Mine\\", which has shades of the original sound, this album has gone a long way down a different side street. It is, to me, very boring. I know that not everyone will agree, so my best recommendation is to ensure you listen to it before buying it... make your own choice - just don't buy it because it says Iron & Wine.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game ever it is very thrilling and exciting plus also it is a better version of temple run and it is so much fun
1579128955|4.0|People always pick this up and start reading.  Lots of information and pictures.  A great price for a cool book.
0307476073|2.0|I wanted to love this book, even like it, but alas, not what I expected.<br />The writing is good, but the subject matter was sometimes disturbing and unfortunately I could not relate to this young woman at all. I expected to enjoy it, by the book description and fought my way to the end hoping each page would get better and the story would take me to place of beauty but instead it was like reading a young girls dark journal
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I was in combat in Vietnam as an infantryman though not as intensive as what &#34;Sledgehammer&#34; experienced and I can say this book along with &#34;The Naked and the Dead&#34; as being two of the best novels in depicting what modern combat is truly like.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is a fast paced suspenseful thriller that begins with the broad daylight kidnapping of an FBI agent in downtown Chicago only blocks from the federal building. It is noon on a Monday and the woman an FBI Special Agent is picking up her dry cleaning as usual but is hampered because of a sprain knee she suffered playing soccer over the weekend so she needs a crutch to navigate. As she steps out of the shop she drops her dry cleaning on the sidewalk and Jack Reacher just happens to be passing by and as a gentleman that he is stops to help her with her dry cleaning. At the same time three thugs with guns accosted her and kidnaps her at gunpoint and Jack too. They are chained together and thrown into the back of a panel truck and are taken cross country to an isolated Montana location where a crazy leader of a Militia group is planning a show stopper for the 4th of July weekend. It is up to Jack Reacher to solve the problem. It is not easy because at every turn obstacles are placed in his way. It is definitely a good read from the first page to the last! But you the reader must join the search and rescue mission, which at times seem literally bogged down and impossible. I really enjoyed the story! I gave it five stars because it was a well crafted and kept you wondering what would happen next. So with that in mind I invite you to read this suspenseful thriller. I loved “Die Trying” a story that shows anything is possible if you set your mind to it!
B002YIHO7I|5.0|As with just about every one of Sade's releases, it takes a couple listens before you realize you've been hipnotized again by one of the most incredible singer/songwriters of her time, accompanied by a band that probably should all be individually famous in their own right but are just happy to basque in Sade's sunlight.<br />Such precision tightness and fluidity within a group of musicians and a singer is RARE and what is even more rare is the ability for that same group to put out release after release of high quality strokes of genius but, once again, Sade does it on \\"Soldier Of Love\\".<br />Sade was genius to insist at the begining of it all, that she be allowed to bring the band with her and to market themselves as a unit rather than Sade as a solo artist. The band wraps it's self around her vocals like a hand in glove and one compliments the other so well. The live experience with Sade is also worth every penny you have to beg, borrow or steal to buy a ticket to be a part of it! Don't miss a Sade live show if you can help it.<br />\\"Soldier Of Love\\" is no different from her other works. After about the 3rd or 4th listen, you begin to see the thread that winds through the entire fabric of the LP and makes it cohesive and concise. Then it becomes, once again, a treat for the senses that is what most of Sade's albums do to the listener.<br />My other half calls Sade \\"Sex on a CD\\" and when we heard \\"Soldier of Love\\" it was dubbed \\"Sex on a CD with a Mission!\\" Anyone who thinks anything less is not 'listening' or is expecting some top 40 fluff. A hit single is not necessary to make a Sade release incredible, but, if one has to have it, Soldier of Love does it for us!<br />She can wait another 10 years between releases if she wants to, but, I certainly hope not!! The only thing better than listening to Sade, is listening to NEW Sade. One of the best ensemble groups recording and touring. There is not a bad cut on this CD. It is sultry pop/jazz/torch at it's finest anddeserves more than a quick listen and a hasty review as was required with each of their releases.<br />\\"Soldier of Love\\" is just another hauntingly sensual & breathtaking chapter on the ride...enjoy.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Watched with my child and we loved it. We enjoy all the Disney original movies and MOST of the sequels. They did a nice job on this series.
0723257639|5.0|My daughter had a Peter Rabbit themed room. It wouldn't have been complete without the collection. No childhood is complete without hearing these stories and I love the box so I know that I have all the books organized and in their home when I clean.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|my wife loves this cd.  its what they play at her zumba classes. and she loves to listen to<br />it in the car and she is 65. but pitbull is her man
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Generally when a movie wins an Academy Award, most of the acclaim is just hype in my experience.  In this case however, I found it very good.  Can't wait for the sequel(s).
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a great mouse for the price you can't beat. It also comes with customization software that you can use for more features or just plug in the mouse and go. It is good for computer gaming or just every day use.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Amazing film, wonderful acting and talented singers. A classic that will go down in cinematic history.<br />Multi format a bonus, can watch it anywhere.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great, my daughter plays with it all the time and is quite good, means I can ride my real horse when she stays entertained
B002W1UEW4|5.0|I've considered myself a die-hard fan of the G.I. Joe universe since my youth, and am enamored with this interpretation of years of collecting and reading the Marvel, Image, and Devil's Due comics.  Sure, there are elements that we will see that make us cringe and ask &#34;Why did they do that?&#34;...only to have them explain later.<br />Beware! This is not based on the cartoon (thankfully), and leaves out / adds to / reinterprets a more modern and more accessible G.I. Joe to today's youth and movie-goers.<br />I saw this as a delightful reincarnation, and after the second viewing, was even more amused and appreciative of its direction.
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|The free app of the day. Looked interesting enough to give a try. Download and install went well. The first section is a tutorial. I don't know what follows since it won't go beyond that point. After completion of tutorial I have no way to go forward.
1403712522|4.0|Good abridgment as abridgements go. Miss the N.C. Wyeth illustrations. They make the story come alive. four more words added.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This story was beautifully written, easy to read, interesting and simply a good read. You are really pulled into the text and get lost in the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's mindless and very addicting.  the graphics - characters - are too cute.  i can't believe how much time i've already burned on it.  :-)
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|The animation was amazing but the story line was so weird.  I would not recommend it nor would I want to see it again. Disney/Pixar fail.
B007N8RULO|2.0|Just don't care for this app after EXTENSIVELY using the computer app for so many years.  just doesn't quite operate the same.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Hugo makes it quite clear why the French Revolution had to happen, even though the character/raison d'etre for the uprising changed during the years of the Terror.  Highlights how there will always be people who will use anything/anyone for their personal benefit with no regard for other people around them.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i do burn time on this one, but who can beat it for free.  and i've bought in to going back and trying to clear the levels at three stars.  grrr.  really don't have to with all the levels available.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|I thought was very good. I just love Motown..<br />Brings back lots of memories as I was growing up In Flint MI.
B000KIPT30|3.0|These are ok, but tend to distort when pushed.<br />Had several that one channel was nonfunctional, but was sufficient for my needs.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game and it was even better that it was free. I just started playing it and I found it very easy to play
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Wish the rod were ceramic instead of diamond coated steel.<br />The carbide and ceramic v sharpeners do the job as intended.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Finally a show that offers a sense of fairness in the world. For every time you felt preyed on or stabbed in the back and fantasized about REVENGE this show gives you what you needed at that time and inspires a no more Bull state of mind for the future!!! LOVE IT😍
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The rich details of the other universe really brought this season alive. Another thing I really liked is how the lines become blurred in the area of &#34;good guys&#34; and &#34;bad guys&#34;. Who is really which?
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell and Quell:Reflect are both great games and are lots of fun for people who enjoy sequences and patterns. Planning moves and mastering the puzzles is giving my brain a workout. I hope more versions come out soon.
B007WFTFG6|3.0|My son seems to have fun using it, however I think its very hard to color the pictures in with your finger and make ti look half decent, but he does't seem to mind...he just turned 4!
B002BWP49C|4.0|Breaking Dawn into two films was not necessary although this last book of the series was long. The wedding scene was great and Bella giving birth to her daughter was somewhat gory. Overall, I did like Breaking Daw Part 1
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I think its a great game, easy to play even for my 4 year old!  I have been on bedrest with a difficult pregnancy so it has been nice to have my little boy sit with me and we take turns playing!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This film follows fairly well Tolkien's book except for having Saruman killed here instead of at the end of the Lord of the Rings series.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|another good novel by child & only reason i did not rate it five stars is i thought the ending was a bit weak compared to his other novels; i would still recomend this book to anyone who enjoys the reacher series
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The movie was great although there were many things that were not in the book and some things that were in the book that were omitted from the picture. My main complaint is that the relative short story of the book is being made into three different films. In Jackson's three films on the Lord of the Rings, it made sense to make three films since there were based on three book, The Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers and the Return of the King. However, the book The Hobbit is smaller in size than anyone of the books in the Lord of the Ring series and it is being broken up in three pictures.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|another good, long, detailed novel by clancy but i still think his latest novels do not measure up to some of his earlier ones like sum of all fears, hunt for red october etc & his later ones seem to have more of a political message behind them although this some less so than locked on novel
B001UV4XFG|5.0|The film followed the book, both if them being very great. The battle scene between Victoria and Edward was well staged.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Downton Abbey season 3 is darker than the previous, but equally enthralling. My biggest disappointment is that it's only nine episodes long.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I definitely could identify with the Dad's defense of his son, but could also understand the Mom's realization that there might be something wrong with Jacob.  .
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is great you can do a lot, survival and creative you can't dislike it if you dislike it you either hate fun or haven't played it
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was skeptical at fist, but the storyline really drew me in as well as the graphics.  Had a good time playing.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I have always enjoyed star trek.  I love a lot of the characters, plots and places they travelled. Is very enjoying.
B003730LRY|5.0|I've seen this movies many times and it still makes me laugh.  Very cleaver dialogue, great characters and great actors.  I just love, love, love it!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best I play it all the time and never get bored it just needs to be updated more
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|We enjoyed bejeweled on the old cell phones and are glad to have a form of it on the tablet. Not quite the same but close enough
B00B361HO8|5.0|Memphis is an outstanding album with Boz at the top of his game.  Highly recommended.  This will be a top album of the year.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Just as good as the other Lord of the Ring movies.  We saw it in IMAX 3D at the movies and knew we had to have it.  Peter Jackson is amazing!  Love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I liked the simplicity of the play so much that I got it for my phone also.  Tapping to move cards makes it so easy to use.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I'm very happy with this car charger, because it does exactly what it's designed to do: charge Smart Phones and iPads and iPods and... DA DA DA ... Kindle products quickly.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) I've charged my Kindle Fire on the go -- and it's truly a *fast* charge.<br />2) My iPod Touch also charged perfectly. (I keep an extra cord in the car at all times, because I plug my iPod into my stereo system.)<br />3) This little charger saved my friend's Samsung Galaxy S2's day with a charge on the fly.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) I'd think twice before attempting to charge older products, because it *is* a full-speed charger and may not be compatible with older technology.<br /><br />This is a great little charger at a great price! Anker makes a solid product.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|I loved the action, it was exciting and intense with long single takes, no chaotic jump cuts or ridiculous wire work.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|amazing, great. sweet. love it. great game. i dnt knw what else to say..  say diamond dash finally came to kindle when is candy crash comi g
B00936A0ZW|1.0|Sometimes Paul's albums take time for me to appreciate. Sometimes I love them instantly. This is the first album where only one song is marginally bearable (\\"Atmosphere On The Moon\\"); the other 10, I can't listen for more than 15 seconds. It's just so... drab. Every song sounds like it was written between 1970 and 1975. Yes, Paul can play anything he wants. Yes, his singing has improved a great deal and I no longer cringe when I hear a vocal line begin. Yes, the production is first-rate. But the music, man! The music! Blech! There are no hooks, no decent melodies, not even rhythm parts I can appreciate. I've never heard Paul play like this before. I pray I never hear anything like this again. I realize this isn't much help as a review, but I don't know how to articulate my disappointment with this one. I don't love everything Paul records, but this album goes nowhere and stays there. I just don't hear any \\"heart\\" here. I hope he has better inspiration the next time he goes back in the studio.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|fantastic....a book about why so women are not working at higher levels but NOT a book about oppression/discrimination - reveals what we as women do to sabotage or inhibit our chance for success.  Don't be afraid to put yourself out there....the men do it every day  she is funny, real and inspiring
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|This series is fun to watch, good character development, lots of suprises.  I would suggest anywone likeing Fringe and continuum watch Torchwood.
B000GIXIGY|5.0|I still have my vinyl copy, but I no longer have a turntable, so the CD is just fine and dandy.
0590259385|5.0|This is a great book and all our grandkid, grand nieces and friends' grandkids  have loved learning from this book. Our daughter read this all the time to our first grandson before he was born.
B003M70O5O|4.0|A little gruesome, but entertaining. Enjoyed watching a few at a time. Love the streaming capability. Looking forward to more.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This movie is awesome! It was long, but not once did I check the time thinking, &#34;Ok...this is enough.&#34; The acting is top-notch. You will not be disappointed. Quentin Tarantino can make movies!!
1451668945|4.0|Daddy's Gone A Hunting<br />Mary Higgins Clark<br />Simon & Schuster, Apr 9 2013, $26.99<br />ISBN: 9781451668940<br /><br />Retired Gus Schmidt meets CPA Kate Connolly at four thirty in the morning at her family-owned Connelly Fine Antique Reproductions in Long Island City; where he once worked.  An explosion leaves Gus dead and Kate unconscious.  While Kate lies comatose and unable to defend herself, rumors abound as to why she met with a former employee before the place was open.<br /><br />Her sister, fashion designer Hannah, wants the truth, which she believes will exonerate her sibling.  Clues lead to the disappearance almost three decades ago of an aspiring actress from Illinois whose attorney brother has just moved to the city and to a two years old cold case murder of a Barnard student.<br /><br />Readers who can ignore the quadrillion happenchance plot forwarding moments will enjoy this suspenseful tale; as Hannah, bungling her amateur sleuthing endeavor, brings tension to the entertaining storyline; more than the villain and the felonious few abetting the culprit.  Though not one of Mary Higgins Clark's stronger thrillers, fans of the author will want to know what is going on in this exciting mystery.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00BESM14U|4.0|The characters were interesting, the pace was good and there was always something surprising right around the corner.  Excellent rainy day entertainment.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Very engrossing. The torture scenes at the beginning of this movie are hard to watch but once you get past that the movie pulls you in with strong characters. A great behind the scenes take on what might have happened to bring down Osama Bin Laden.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|the critics were just wrong.  sometimes I think the critics need a negative headline for big budget gambles;  this movie was worth its cost.  creation of the Martian landscape,  multiple alien races,  technology so different from our own  was a Herculean endeavor.<br /><br /> the story is elaborately woven and a tribute to the writing on which it was based.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Fun Game like the updates tho I miss the mini game and bonus round like they had in first the game but all in all not bad. Hope it gets updates and more levels put on.
0131479415|4.0|Although this book is very strong on the methodologies of Agile Estimating and Planning, reality is that projects do not get approved with the very wide delivery date and functionality variances the author proscribes before the project begins. The variance might be reality, but project budgets must be approved based on planned dollars, not wide ranging dollar ranges.<br /><br />I would like to see the addition of a strategy to get projects approved or maybe an approval process based on increasing knowledge through the process. Maybe the budget is approved in phases.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Had a very realistic feel, making the reader feel they were closely following an actual murder trial.  Author keeps you guessing with several clever plot twists, although some may find the ending a bit deus ex machina. Characters are tightly and expertly drawn.  Thoughtfully treats many difficult issues about parenting, the misery of the victim balanced against the plight of the perpetrator and his family, and a new take on &#34;nature vs nurture&#34;.  You may find yourself still wondering about Jacob's guilt or innocence after you finish this book.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this work which I read for book club.  I wish I could ask the author what point if any he was trying to make.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Very handy and versatile, but tutorials could be better.  I'm going to need a book to learn it.  Two more words.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun free bingo game. Very nice graphics.chat availability.  Fun games. Always updating the site. Not good on personal contact for support. Mostly form letters. Could use help for live support.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I looooooooooovvve this game so much. I like how you can groom your horses. I also like how you can put them in shows in stuff. peace
B00C49H3WI|5.0|we start off with a young woman who obviously is semi tough, brought up on the streets. she is on the outs with her boyfriend and her child stays with someone else. she goes to london and while underground in the tube station she sees a woman who looks just like her commit suicide. out of options, she assumes the woman's identity but incredibly the woman turns out to be a police detective!  while trying to pass as her, she runs into yet another woman who looks just like her! so the plot is swiftly turning minute by minute from street tough to identity theft to cloning! incredibly the script works as does the lead.  she is able to catch the nuances from character to character which sets each clone apart. i am only a few episodes in but am already committed to watching the whole thing.<br /><br />the only disappointing thing about this is that every time i try a great new show on tv, it is almost inevitably from the UK, not the US. uk tv is now coming in great big doses to our country and it is no longer just the masterpiece theater variety we are getting. indeed, this show is as opposite to that kind of show as possible. with much smaller budgets and resources, they are turning out winner after winner. our cable tv holds up well to it but our network tv is increasingly looking like drek in comparison.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0143120530|5.0|the author took his young, intelligent mind and good his good nature into a contest of memory - a special kind of memorization used by the ancients - that took a yea of his life.  My favorite chapters were 1) meeting the adult man with no memory, forced to live in an eternal present and 2) the actual contest and how our author did, (I won't spoil it for you)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I wouldn't call this the greatest book I have ever read, but I would heartily recommend it as a good read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Matthew Quick really knows how to draw in his audience and make them experience the book with the troubled characters. 5 stars!
0307476073|3.0|First of all, I love Cheryl Strayed. Her colllection Tiny Beautiful Things is a book I plan to keep all of my life, but Wild was a bit too monotonous for my taste.  Her writing style is great, her feelings and thoughts come through clearly and wonderfully, but this recounting of her hike on the PCT grew stale after a while.  She struggles physically, mentally and emotionally, then she encounters people who mostly add a bright spot to her journey, then she moves on to repeat the process.  I admire her for doing what she did, but it ends up making for tedious reading after a while, despite her talent.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a great book!! Very suspenseful and made you not ever want to put the book down.  Highly recommended.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This is a great movie for the young and middle age crowd. We as adults can appreciate the old video game references and  the new characters that have been created are great!<br />Also, if you hit pause while the movie is playing and leave it paused for about 4-5 seconds there are 'extras'. They give some fun facts about the movies and how they came up with the concepts.<br />I would definitely recommend it!
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Wasn't really what I thought it would be.  The characters didn't seem to have much depth.  By switching back and forth in years it made the book a fast read.  However, each time I went back and forth I got disappointed because there was no new excitement that took you to a different time period.  Just seemed a little dull.  No suspense.
B000FBJG04|5.0|This book had a profound affect on me. Having grown up in the fifties & sixties men like these veterens were my employers and mentors. All of them have since  passed away. I only wish I was more aware of what they went through when I was younger. Most of them did not want to talk about the war, only ocassional humorous anecdotes. These men were able to reach into their pasts and dredge up what must have been terrible past memories to give a true accounting of what the war was really like. Very moving.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a well balanced game lots of opportunity to expand with out having to spend money but if you do spend money it dosent cost a lot ive personally spent 20.00 dollars and have had fun.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This has lots of levels, is great fun and is good exercise for your brain.<br />I highly recommend you try it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A must have<br />Wonderfully invigorating<br />Interactive<br />Needed for horse owners<br />This app is interesting and fun...I have become obsessed.and it's free!!!
B009NNG202|1.0|This was a horrible movie. I do not see how anyone could have enjoyed this film! I give it two thumbs down only because I don't have more thumbs.
B00170MYIS|4.0|Bought this as an extra battery to have for our camera when away from home.  I am sure it will be nice to have when we need a fresh battery and the other one is charging.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|My grandkids love this movie, they watch it about every night! We have had it for three weeks and haven't seen it yet since they pass it back and forth between themselves.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Very interesting stories on why people do things over and over without really thinking...insightful to those wondering &#34;how did that happen?&#34;
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show is enjoyable. It is much better than Cats. I am going to watch it again and again.<br />Police are humans too, and make the same humanistic decisions the rest of us do.  Watch this and see how it is much better than Cats.  Watch it again and again.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Glad I took a chance on this. Now I can't wait for the new season. It has everything you need to love a tv series. Action, drama, sci fi, mystery. It's all there.
1400106338|5.0|I listened to this on a trip shortly after it arrived and found defects on two of the discs in the set.  No problem getting a replacement.  The second set is pristine.  It is read well and I would recommend it to a friend.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun twist on solitaire<br />love this game for quick diversion that doesn't frustrate...<br />have it on phone and kindle. both are fun but slightly different.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It works well for my needs. I watched a full length video and had no problems with the case as others did. I would buy it again.
0142405809|5.0|My grandson & I love this book , the story of enduring friendship is one to teach all people, young and old. We loved the illustrations so much we ordered a second book to frame for the grandchildren's room at out house. Wonderful book!
B008RJFRTK|5.0|map is exactly what I wanted - a general offline map for use in my travels out of cell service range
1741798981|4.0|This book is nicely organized and contains information for all budgets. I will definitely purchase other travel guides from this publisher.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Heart warming read.  Quite liked the order.  I guessed that Lily was alive.  The story could have had more depth.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book went into depth on the history of processed foods. I will not shop the grocery store the same. I was really aware of how much sugar and fat was in my foods, but was amazed at how much salt I am ingesting. In addition to being informative, it was a really fun read as well! I have been recommending it to everyone I know.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|loved it, cried over it and I am now talking to my dog and she is responding!! I have already recommended it to others and they have enjoyed it too.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A book especially for kids in middle school but good for other kids too. I liked it a lot it was more of a picture book but a good chapter book too.~ Sydney
B006TF6WAM|2.0|This could have been a really interesting book, but it is just so tedious and long winded and the climax was  too gruesome.
B00BWJ91XK|2.0|The previous 3 movies were excellent - this one was poorly done, I wasted my money - rent it if you can.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is the best game ever I can play it 24/7 cool game.gameloft games are the best app ever. cool game
B008HT4FUW|1.0|The quality of the transfer is unwatchable.  It's fifteen frames a second or less, not the full 30fps, and thus looks very jerky.  The people who put this set out should be ashamed.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love the game but very difficult to get enough credits to play many games in higher level rooms daily. Also, Kindle updates are slow to get.  Would give it 5 if updates were available quicker and got more daily credits!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Tough, at times, to follow. What a sad and interesting story.  It's amazing ALL the characters didn't take their own lives on their terms. I don't know if I'd have the intestinal fortitude to exist in such horrible conditions, day after day.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I love the movie & the combo pack is perfect for me so I have multiple ways to finally view the movie!
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I did not enjoy this book at all.  I rarely start a book I cant finish and this was a tough one!
B00846REIS|4.0|It is basicallly the same book as 50 Shades of Grey...same idea..<br />I was hoping it would be a little bit different.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Long build with no climax!! This is a poor addition to the rest of the series and didn't give me a want to see the next one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show it has really picked up since season 1 and I am looking forward to season 4
B006X5L6VS|5.0|The Night Sky , I love this app its so cool on a clear night so you can make out all the stars plus it has a cool feature for satellites
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Compaed to MCPE this game sucks. Even the ds version is better. The name is even bad. Scribblenauts sounds like a baby game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an excellent book. It kept me wanting more. I finished the book in only two days and I would recommend it to anyone.
0312117337|5.0|Love the art! This deck is absolutely beautiful. Though not your traditional deck it is a great change with new perspectives and insights and great wisdom. Love it.
1250007208|3.0|This is the beginning of a trilogy and there was a lot of groundwork to lay down so I felt that it started a little slow.  However, once the story got going I felt that it had promise and became interesting.  Cinder is a cyborg in a society that disdains them and thus she is an outcast.  She has a mean stepmother, two stepsisters, and becomes acquainted with the prince when he's incognito at the market where she has a booth as a mechanic.  But there's political intrigue as the evil Lunar Queen wants to marry the prince, make war on Earth, and control everyone with her brainwashing power.  There's a mysterious plague that's killing Earthens and Cinder is right in the middle, as well as trying to attend a ball and dance with the prince.  It's a clever re-telling and the last third really got the story rolling, so that by the end I was invested and ready for the sequel.
B004SIP7QC|5.0|Highly recommend it. Definitely a tear jerker though! Make sure to grab a box of Kleenex before you start it
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Diamond Dash kinda cool I think I may like it more once I play it a little bit more .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Started watching on netflix and got addicted so had to buy it on amazon and i love it !! cant wait for the upcoming season
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This show seriously keeps you on your toes the whole time. It is very well written and has amazing actors in it too! I cannot wait for season five!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is the best sharpened for my bug out bag. Small in size and will sharpen straight blade and serrated.
1423124111|5.0|They won't pay attention to you anymore once they get their hands on this book. I've had friends come over, see the book there, and begin reading from cover to cover. It's a must have for anyone who likes graphic design, theme park history, or Disneyland in general.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|So this movie has more of a light-hearted feel than Lord of the Rings. It's a fantastic movie though! If you have ever read the book, I think you will love this movie. And if you haven't, please still give it a try!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The touching storyline, the amazing visual effects, beautiful costumes, great 3D-details, ...  all in all, it's the absolute best movie that I have been watching over and over.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This is a very good book. I couldn't put it down! Off to read the next book in the series
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This show seriously keeps you on your toes the whole time. It is very well written and has amazing actors in it too!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I am not one to praise a  great many books.  I was told this book was boring in the beginning but I found that the entire book was a joy to read. The religion aspects and the viewpoints concerning animal captivity was refreshing and thoughtful.
B000069AT7|5.0|This box set includes the original theatrical release as well as v.2 that Steven (yes. We're on first name basis.. he and I...) saw fit to make at the time. Also included is the live orchestral performance from the Shrine Auditorium with a full house in attendance.  When you watch the movie and listen to this live performance you'll notice faint sounds of audience reactions.  LOVE IT.<br /><br />There's nothing bad I can say about this box set. It gives you a good amount of extras, an amazing book, sound quality is wonderful, and listening to John's music (yep... first name basis... he and I) in 5.1 surround sound is a beautiful thing to hear.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Awesome costumes and period decor! Great acting and plot. Downton Abby is much more grand however. But, this was a fine stepping stone.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I love the Hannibal movies.  I love the original actors playing the character roles.  I wasn't optimistic that the actors would be able to pull this off and lure me into liking them enough to watch the entire season.  They did it!  I will be watching.  Great start to the season!!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Wonderful. Cd. Enjoyed it emensley. Thank you blake. Keep the awesome music coming.  Love a ything country. Listen to cd daily
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This movie was very fun! I really enjoyed the clean animation it has to offer. One of my favorite movies!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This is a must see for any age.  I think my son know all the words to songs, and the movie.
B000KN7BIQ|1.0|I hate this DVD, it doesn't work, it cannot be read, and the warranty expired 2 days ago. I am very disappointed, very unhappy. I prefer to lose my money today, but NOT to spend more money with you again. I am very disappointed, very unhappy.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|erased my game right before i had the great white unlocked. was enjoying the game up until that point.  thanks fer nuthin
B00785P2QC|5.0|I just love games like this. There needs to be a lot more like this in the free to 99&cent; range.
0316017930|5.0|To a person that doesn't read a whole lot, this book pulls you in by being easily readable. It's very interesting and pulls you inn within the first few pages.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This show seriously keeps you on your toes the whole time. It is very well written and has amazing actors in it too!
B00447G29S|5.0|I purchased the 3D version even though I already own the DVD and Blu-Ray versions.  The IMAX 3D format is how I originally experienced this wonderful story that our family has read at Christmas every year going back a ways.  It was also my first modern experience with 3D at the IMAX back in mid-00's.  It was incredible in IMAX 3D, with snowflakes close enough to reach out and touch and the dancing waiters on the train and many, many other portions that were designed for the 3D effect.<br /><br />Since I had invested in a 70&#34; Sharp Aquos Quattron 240 Mhz LED 3D television, a higher end, Pioneer Blu-Ray 3D player and seven sets of the powered, three switch mode (3D mode, 2D while the TV is displaying a 3D picture mode and an off mode) 3D glasses, I had to have this movie in 3D because it played a big part in my acquisition of a very high quality, complete 3D system that didn't break the bank.<br /><br />At night, when watching this movie in 3D in darkness, it is amazingly like the IMAX 3D experience. Same snow flake effects, right in your living room or home theatre.  Wow!...<br /><br />For those of you who are reading this and are considering purchasing a 3D System (TV/Blu-Ray), you should be purchasing a LED Full 1080p system that uses the powered glasses until the glass-free systems become truly workable and reasonable in price. You will not be happy with the non-powered glasses and non-LED experience. Yes, it's less expensive but if you really want 3D, don't go cheap, if you want to see great 3D effects. You should also purchase an extended warranty and a locking wall mount. I wouldn't just set this behemoth on an entertainment cabinet.  Plus, you can get very high quality multi-dimensional wall mounts that allow for tilting and swiveling, so that you're not locked into a specific furniture arrangement permanently.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|this is an older family movie that is always fun to watch again and again... so come along a join them the Adams Family.
B000K7UG34|4.0|I like the story, and the commitment of a commander to his troops in a tough part of the Vietnam war.  I bought it on an impulse and it is clearly not among the best in my video library, but still worth watching.
B007V65R54|5.0|Anyone &#34;who is moved by Statistics&#34;(Oscar Wilde) should read this book even those who are not. Well worth the money.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great read. I cannot wait to read the next installment of this series. Love the way this author keeps me captivated.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This show seriously keeps you on your toes the whole time. It is very well written and has amazing actors in it too!
B003Y5H556|5.0|It bears repeating that this rating was chosen simply because I was overall pleased with my purchase and the quality of this product was excellent.  I would recommend this to my friends and family.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|High marks for this film in every regard...here is the use of technical effects as thoughtful and completely fitting. New effects were employed and created by the &#34;Brothers&#34; at the controls of the making of a &#34;New Classic&#34;. They had the creative &#34;Juices flowing&#34;<br />all the way for this movie and is very often &#34;borrowed&#34; from by many filmmakers. A completely unique film experience...sci-fi or otherwise....The Matrix is a stunning classic by any measure. If you like sci-fi.....You'll love this movie !
B00867GHS8|3.0|I think it is not a very compelling story.  You got the stupid premise of a fish looking for his son and having to travel a long way to find him and the rest is way to predictable - even if we never made it through to the end.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of Pixar but you have to hand it to them - they created a formula for minting money and they have stuck to it.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|If you are looking for anything like the Song of Ice and Fire or Lord of the Rings series, find something else. This book was very poorly written, explaining character's thoughts and feelings in the most boring, unimaginative way possible. That being said, I did finish reading it.<br /><br />I will not be reading any of the other books in this series. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone over the age of 12.
B009AMALLM|4.0|This is a paranormal activity movie so it really is just like the others but I personally think this is the best of all of them.
B000N2HCM4|3.0|I ended up skipping sections that were too detailed and uninteresting.  Mr. Obama is a fluid writer but the book didn't hold my attention.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Awesome story i am so hooked into this series. i love greek mythology. percy and his friends travel into the labyrinth
0142421715|4.0|This book was great but I'm still thinking that the first is the best. Now I have to read Reached to see if it is my favorite or is just the first. Thanks!
B00BHMF578|5.0|I thought it was well written and well acted. It may not have been 100% accurate but it was a lot of fun to watch.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I heard one of their songs on the radio, and I was hooked!  Then I watched a special on TV about their touring on a train.  I have watched it twice and it is recorded for future viewing.  Great music -- it just appeals to me.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love the conflict.  I love the characters, even the ones I hate.  I can't wait to see what is going to happen next, and it is never quite what I expect.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I did not want a Dedicated eReader as I wanted a miniature Laptop, but I like to read.  This app did the trick for my Tablet.  Very Satisfied.
B00280LYHS|5.0|great series. awesome ending of the series or is it? check out the heroes of olympus to contine percy, grover, annabeth's stories and meet a completely different group of demigods
B00BIKCYAU|5.0|If you are a fan of the show, you have to get this. The bonus features are awesome, and the added benefit of having the digital copy makes it all the more worthwhile. I love being able to pull up episodes on my phone or computer without needing the disk - the only complaint I have about that feature is that I usually have to limit myself to one episode on my phone at a time, but that is only because I have too much other stuff on my phone - including movies - and videos do take up a good bit of space. Still, if you are in the market to buy seasons of Game of Thrones, this is a good place to be.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The merchandise arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Great movie--entertaining dialogue--another plus for _Buffy's_ author--Joss Whedon--the interaction among the characters makes the movie worth the watch.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Ended like an Indiana Jones movie.  I don't know why it won an Oscar.  Watch on a day when you have nothing better to do.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I like the large key pad and easy-to-read numbers, and the history feature is a bonus.  It's great for checking my balances when banking and paying bills
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Hours of great game play.  I highly recommend. this. game it's a total blast. The. tutorial is very helpful and guides you straight into play
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The clash of the demigods! will they work together or destroy each other? very good storyline with amazing as the group of 7 seek out to save the world and reunite the demigods
B0027MJU00|3.0|I enjoyed a lot of the book, but didn't think it necessary to be so vivid about the actual killings, much too graphic.  Like a love scene you can leave a lot to the persons imagination and they do just fine with it.  I skipped over some of it, because it definitely grossed me out, don't need that.  there's enough in the world without picking up a book for enjoyment and adventure and be taken to these dar places so vividly.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|The dvd arrived promptly and in good condition; it's a great movie for us old guys with some of our favorite folks playing their best parts.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|The whole family enjoyed watching the movie again and again.  The movie was very well done.  Again, just a good movie.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Excellent information based on science. Reading this book is changing my eating habits. After only 16 days of no wheat, I can feel the difference! I am not experiencing carb ups and downs and I have noticed that my obsessive thinking about eating has decreased significantly. The author's sense of humor was great!
B003L77G6A|5.0|I just love this series and enjoy all of them. The writers are fantastic. The actors are so well chosen for each character. It is so funny and as I said before the actors are really great !! I enjoy it very much! As I said it as great acting and fantastic writters.
B0053TMP24|5.0|great second book of the new series. a must read for anyone who enjoyed the percy jackson series. Great storyline as well
1451695195|5.0|I read it very quickly - his story sweeps you in immediately.  I don't need &#34;proof&#34; but I enjoyed Eben sharing his experience.<br />I lent my copy to someone who recently lost a brother....it's the kind of book that needs to be shared.
B000007MVD|5.0|Un álbum de rock & roll puro, mezclando canciones inéditas grabadas por Los Beatles con temas propios, una verdadera joya que muestra las influencias más grandes que tuvieron los Fab Four en sus comienzos: Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly, etc. Además, muestra la simpatía que tanto marcó a mejor grupo de la historia. Totalmente recomendable
B005M5OSBK|5.0|Beautiful singing and instrumentation.  If there is a European language they missed (perhaps Ladino?  Welsh?) then perhaps they may yet address that.
1400049628|4.0|the book says its supposed to be humorous, but it wasn't funny at all. however it was a very interesting book!
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This book is a fictional account of a company whose IT department transforms itself from an undisciplined disaster to a smoothly functioning code \\"manufacturer\\" that seamlessly integrates its Dev, OPS & Security functions.<br /><br />The book's purpose appears to be to provide the principles that characterize world-class IT organizations - and does so by illustrating those principles within the mechanism of a most entertaining story.  Consequently, the book struck me as an ideal accompaniment to a company-sponsored course addressing IT process improvements -- although the book can easily be read on its own as well.<br /><br />Others reviews have focused on the story itself.  My feeling is that the more experience you've had within (or interacting with) an IT organization, the more the book will relate to your own experiences and so the more interesting the story will be to you (and the more inspired you will be to do something to help fix your own company's IT organization).  I gave the book four stars because it is a great IT-related book of fiction, but not a great book of fiction.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|great first book of the new series. The new demigods are here and are changing everything you thought you knew about the demigods
B00005RDRO|5.0|My husband has mentioned this film a few weeks ago as one he really enjoyed and so I decided to order it and I am glad I did. The acting is delightful...no matter what anyone says about Truman Capote. Zany actions and the all star cast make this a must-have for everyone who enjoyed great comic send-ups.
0385349947|5.0|I thought this was a thoughtful, interesting book on a difficult topic. As a working mother of four and a partner in a law firm, I can understand a lot of what she was saying. I think this is a must read for all women interested in demanding careers.
B00AY0A71I|5.0|The old lady with the 3 dogs was extremely funny.  Just to watch her actions when we first meet her and then seeing her when she's down to her last dog was just funny!!!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Fasten your seat belts ~ he's baaaaaaack, and in FINE form.<br />Great casting & writing, superb acting ! Well done & Thank You !!  :)
B006AZZPCM|4.0|The user interface needs some improvements but for a free app it gets the job done. Great app I'm glad I was able to find it!
B0030ZOYJ0|1.0|I stupidly didn't check this in the dvd player when I got, and so discovered the subtitles problem when it was too late to return the dvd. BE WARNED! Check that the subtitles work properly!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I generally stick to fiction - I like non-fiction, but rarely make it all the way through one book before picking up another.  This book was a funny quick read.  I really enjoyed the wit and comedic comment on various social issues.  As a fan of SNL and 30 Rock, it was neat to see what it was like behind the scenes.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|A wonderful plot and character development.  However, the lengthy descriptions of, for instance, the French sewer system and Waterloo were too long and tedious.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie followed the book reasonably well. What I considered a major flaw was that the so called 12 to 16 year olds in &#34;the games&#34; appeared to be more like 20-somethings. I understand that a movie showing the younger age group killing each other as written in the book would have been difficult for many movie goers to stomach, but it was a key concept to the story. If the subject matter was too upsetting for making the movie properly, then it should have not been attempted.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Not only was &#34;Toy Story&#34; a technical marvel, but it is simply a very sweet movie!<br /><br />The animation was beautiful.  The characterizations fantastic.  Woody and Buzz will always be among my favorite movie characters.<br /><br />Loved it with my then five-year-old daughter and still love it today.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This was a great set to help bring Minecraft off the computer screen and into the real world for them. They did want to put it together just as the instructions showed and won't yet venture out to create their own designs, but hopefully soon. We actually got it for the Easter Bunny to use and it was used to fill the eggs this year! Kids loved it!
B00AJLHU3K|3.0|I am a Richard Thompson fan, really I am.<br />Personally, I consider Mr. Thompson to be one of the greatest Strat players of all time, if not THE greatest, and I speak with some authority on this subject, having seen Jimi Hendrix perform.<br />In light of that, naturally I looked forward to the release of this all-electric album with great anticipation.<br />Right now... I'm disappointed.<br />The playing is lovely, of course... a bit raucous, but lovely.  Perhaps Richard should have considered releasing an album similar to Frank Zappa's effort \\"Shut Up And Play Your Guitar\\".<br />Though Thompson's lyrics here are not patently offensive as most of Zappa's were, they are gratuitously depressing.<br />If a depressing subject needs to be addressed, or must be tackled, then it must.<br />But here Thompson seems to have become a caricature of himself and his lyrics have become self-conscious parodies of Richard's finer sad and gloomy songs.<br />The lyrics often seem incongruously juxtaposed to self-consciously raucous playing.<br />The result is plain nasty.<br />The milder songs on the album are weak.<br />The result in toto is hardly his best work, and will certainly not win any new fans for Richard.  It may turn people off to him, which would be a shame.<br />I'm not sure if Richard is trying to close the door on his career or to slam the door in the face of potential new fans, but an album like this could certainly have the latter effect.<br />If you want to listen to high-quality gloom dished out by R.T. in a raucous electric manner, you will be better off listening to \\"You? Me? Us? [Voltage enhanced]\\" or \\"Mirror Blue\\".<br />Pass on this one.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Just started the Sword of Truth books but they are fantastic! I would highly recommend this book series and the tv show based on it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Fast action, good mind thinking,The change in norm by author is making the book fast reading. Hope Suzanne can keep up the &#34;off the wall&#34; good reading.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I haven't finished the first season yet, but I'm really enjoying this show so far. The narrative is very complex, characters are dynamic, and the acting is really impressive (especially the child actors!). My only criticisms with the show are the kinds of things other folks have mentioned, it seems like the excessive nudity and sex serve as more of a reminder that you're watching HBO, not basic cable, than really doing much to move the story along. The violence is visceral and gory (awesome!) and I'm really excited to see where they go with the show.
0060526491|5.0|So even though i can find all these short stories online, i still wanted the book just to keep on my invisible bookshelf. I read the whole thing the moment i opened the package.<br /> If you look inside you can see the stories are pretty short. A few of them are only page & only 2 sentences. So im glad i found mine on sale $5. Before it was a ridiculous $17.<br />- Love these sick, twisted & cute little stories.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I've been lost in the music world for some time, not really connecting with any one genre, but Lumineers are a great sound and offer something different. I'm really enjoying the album.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|This app allows exploring my Kindle fire which is why I downloaded it.  The app works as advertised and I like it.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This is an excellent book that helps young adults consider whether the good of the whole is worth the forced sacrifice of a few.  I read it and so did my 12 year old son, and we had some great discussions around the moral dilemmas that this book raises.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros:<br />Comfortable for long periods of wear while gaming.<br />Decent sound quality<br />Decent range, I can walk around the house and still listen to my music playlist from the basement or upstairs.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Connecting the USB dongle to a USB 3.0 port can hang these headphones.  Make sure you have a USB 2.0 port available on your PC or laptop. One symptom of the problem are your configuration program is hung and no amount of left clicking or right clicking on the icon in the tray can open the program.  Docked 1 star for this.<br />Power button seems a little finicky to toggle power on/off.<br />Powering off the headphones doesn't mean that you switched back to speakers for audio.  You need to disconnect the USB dongle too.<br /><br />Indifferent:<br />Voice modulation is kind of meh but thats just a gimmicky feature anyway.  Listening to yourself sound like a squirrel wears off after 5 seconds and some of the other voice modulator characters seemed to make my words muddled and hard to understand.  I'll stick with normal mode myself.<br /><br />Buying it on sale at around $90 I'd buy this product again.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|OneRepublic never disappoints me, but not only that, they always blow me away! Waking Up was my favorite album ever since it came out, the kind of album I could listen to beginning to end, without wanting to skip any songs. I hardly thought this new album could live up to that standard, but it has! It has some fantastic singles on it, such as Counting Stars, Can't Stop, Something I Need, I Lived, and Light It Up. Not only that, but it again is the kind of album that I just love putting on repeat and having it play beginning to end in a loop for hours. The is a work of art, a masterpiece.
B006KP3XCQ|4.0|The packaging was squished, but the disc was perfect.  I received in w/in the stated time and had it in my son's basket for Easter!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Way too many plot holes, impotent twists, and awkward characterizations of beloved characters. This has to be one of the most convoluted screenplays of all-time. It requires a great sense of disbelief, and a great deal of adjustment to where the story jumps off. The wardrobe, cityscapes, the cast, and the cinematography are phenomenal. I will not pretend this is a 'bad' movie, but the script is the weak link. The narrative is confusing, ineffective, and extremely flawed to require a great sense of disbelief (noting the movie is a about a man in a bat suit.)
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|The music is wonderful.  I found the movie to have more continuity than the live presentations with only 2 or 3 sets..
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A brilliant series that is about more than just zombies.  It explores human relationships, moral dilemmas and how our understanding of what it means to be 'human' or 'civilized' can be called in to question under extreme circumstances.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I never miss a Bones story and I am really am enjoying this book.  Topic is abit sad, but justice will prevail
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I enjoyed the show a great deal! I will be sure to get more movies in the future. Thank you
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I've followed Boz since Steve Miller days.I knew all  the songs on Silk Degrees before it produced a hit.MEMPHIS IS FANTASTIC.He always has that unique sound that takes me back to my navy days in San Francisco in the early 60's.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This show, more than any other show Ive watched, is totally captivating.  I simply could not stop watching.  Season 4 was so great.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|This movie really has it all.  There is comedy and sorrow much like real life.  The characters are very real.
B00BF11STU|2.0|This had to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen...add to that the fact that it was over 2 1/2 hours long, and you've got the makings of a yawn fest.  I'm glad I didn't see this in the theatre.  I was able to turn this off, go do something worthwhile, and then go back to it when I had the gumption.  I forced myself to finish it.  I didn't think that any of the performances were good.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|very good a lot of solos and some new music another version of red house<br />would have made it even better.
0785165975|4.0|After now reading all the Kick-Ass Books so far (Kick-Ass, Kick-Ass 2, and this Kick-Ass 2: prelude),  many of the problems I have with this book are the same ones I had with Kick-Ass 2.  Story is good, but doesn't have the magic of the original.<br /><br />The art is actually worst than Kick-Ass 2.  I don't know if JR Jr. is busy, lazy, or just not into it. I see that for this book he is credited for breakdowns and another artist (the inker) is credited with finishes. Personally I don't blame the inker. Who knows how loose the drawings were when JR Jr. handed them over to him. But either way the art suffers. At times it's REALLY bad! Hit-Girl constantly fluctuates from looking like she is 12 in one panel, to looking like a toddler in others.<br /><br />The saving grace to the art is that the coloring is good, and sometimes AMAZING! So that helped save some of it.<br />I also felt that although the story was ok, this was a bit of a missed opportunity. I would have much preferred to read about Hit-Girl and her father before the original Kick-Ass story. A more detailed story of how her father became who he was and in turned made her who she is. This story almost felt useless. When I read Kick-Ass 2, I wasn't really thinking &#34;Wow wish I knew what happened between this and the first book.&#34;<br /><br />Anyway, by no means a horrible book. I don't regret buying it, Some parts are really good. Just overall not as could as it could have been. But if your a fan, its a must buy.
B000002ITM|4.0|Here we are in the post thrash world. Metallica released \\"Metallica\\" Megadeth has \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" and \\"Youthanasia\\" Overkill has \\"I Hear Black\\" it was only a matter of time before Testament joined as well. If you stayed the course like some bands (Canada's Razor as an example) eventually money becomes an issue, but you stay true to your fans and your band. If you change your sound you become a \\"sellout\\" that is absurd. For one, The Ritual is not a sellout album. In my opinion Testament never had a sellout album. Metallica...does Load ring any bells? Megadeth...Risk? Testament... nope can't think of anything because they always retained three things that prevents them from being sellouts 1) They never sacrificed heavy music for radio friendly songs. 2) the lyrical themes may have changed a little, but they are still a throwback to old. 3) The pace of the songs may have slowed, but the technicality and solos are still there. The Ritual is so misunderstood. Chuck Billy's voice is quite possibly at the most melodic it will ever be. The riffs are catchy and the drumming isn't too bad. Actually its mostly mid pace except for a few tracks. This album reminds me of Megadeth's Youthansia in the fact both bands take a step to the days of old and do a crossover act with semi-thrash and heavy metal. That makes for an enjoyable experience even if it is not brutal like The Legacy or The New Order. But old school thrash fans rejoice, Dark Roots Of Earth is pretty solid as well!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David tennant was very entertaining loved him his companions kinda iffy but loved this season kinda hoping he makes a comeback for another season
B00001U0GQ|5.0|Outstanding performances by Daniel Day Lewis and Wes Studi against great scenery of the earlier days of New York State. I sent this as a gift to my friend in Texas- he has a great appreciation for the earlier days of the United States and items such as the French and Indian War.<br />An excellent production for the &#34;Director's Expanded Edition&#34;.<br />To many movies should keep what has been edited out, in the end it makes for the movie's original intent and is a better presentation as an art form.
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|Re, version recentmost, movie &#34;1984&#34;; story accuracy plusgood, acting/production doubleplusgood. Earlier version, 1956 O'Brien, Edmond, duckspeak; recent version 1984 Burton, Richard, doubleplusgood duckspeak.  Video from Eastasia, eternal ally of Oceania, quality: plusgood.  Packagewriting not Newspeak, translate fullwise antewatching. Plusgood pleasure ante three minutes hate.  The war is within measurable distance of its end.  Chocoration increase to 15 grammes per week.  All praise to Big Brother and Oceania for another glorious victory.
B00B23O96A|4.0|not as many jams or blues songs as i would have liked but otherwise ok.<br />not one of his best efforts
B000JMKOI2|5.0|This is Bukowski in all of his alcoholic glory.  Stories of sin, gambling, booze and desperate women.  This is the only man alive that understand work as I do.  The torture of the daily grind and the fraility of life.  Bukowski speaks to the glass being half empty... the other half he already drank.
B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|Has a very Kraftwerk influenced feel, which is no bad thing. Saw them play San Francisco the week of the release and they were fantastic. Played nearly all the greatest hits plus about half of English Electric. The new songs stood up against the old pretty well.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I just love that these musicians have taken music and enhanced it.  My whole family loves this CD. Even my 15 yo granddaughter<br />likes it.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I love every track of this CD. I appreciate his unique voice and personality. With time and experience he will come into honing his beautiful voice.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|As I said above -- good read but not as good as Gone Girl.  I'm now exploring t he rest of her work.  She's a little quirky, but once you get into it -- it's great.
B000FA675C|5.0|even if you have seen the movie read this book.  the book is better than the movie.  it,s excellent read.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|This book offers an intimate and candid look into the formative years of legendary author Charles Bukowski.  It is gripping and a look at how immigrant families merged into American culture from the great depression forward.  Highly recommended.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This story of Flight was compelling from the very beginning. The crash scene was vey well done and eerie. The actors did a very good job of pulling me into the story and rooting for the eventual outcome that was the truth.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watched season 1 in a day and then stretched out season 2 to two days because I did not want it to end! Just got season 3 and I am forcing myself to only watch one episode per day so I can really enjoy it - will probably watch it over again because it's that great!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This book is a page turner. I enjoyed the whole series. It's better to read them in order, but not necessary.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Maybe I'm stupid, but I think I just paid for something that  you have to purchase something else to make it work.  I thought I was getting Word -- apparently not.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want a upgrade for redstone torches red stone switch pressure plates piston all of that I want all things that minecraft Pc has including zepplen mod tornado mod car mod rocket mod
B007REV4YI|5.0|Love the movie, the actors, the scenery, can't remember a JB movie that is so like the originals.  This is it!
0345529057|5.0|This set of books is exactly what a series of books should be - transporting the reader to a world beyond. I became immersed in the Seven Kingdoms. Martin's characters are complex, inspiring love and hate. The details of the world they inhabit are so finely written I can see the world of ice and fire as I read - and after. Five + stars.
B001A4LYN2|4.0|Potent performances and overall direction, but would benefit by more fully developing characters. Be more intriguing to more about how Mr. Fairview became the man he became.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This book is a page turner. I enjoyed the whole series. It's better to read them in order, but not necessary.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is good I saw it and really didn't think  it looked that good but this is awesome .
B009K0P10K|5.0|I cannot get enough of this show.  I look forward to it all week long.  The surprises just keep coming.
B0000669JL|5.0|BOB MARLEY & THE WAILERS-LEGEND: Any roots/rock/reggae groove worth his roach clip owns the seminal albums CATCH A FIRE and UPRISING, but LEGEND seems to be the one compilation that virtually EVERYONE owns. After all, BOB MARLEY's universal message of love, hope, and understanding transcended race, gender, and musical taste. Most folks were first exposed to Jamaica's biggest star in the early seventies via JOHNNY NASH's hit cover of STIR IT UP and ERIC CLAPTON's chart-topping take on I SHOT THE SHERIFF; both lacked MARLEY's emotion-charged vocals, but captured his fiery spirit. Stark acoustic protest REDEMPTION SONG...slinky dance-floor fave COULD YOU BE LOVED (spotlighting BOB's female backing trio THE I THREES)...provocative singalong anthem GET UP STAND UP...these are as important and well loved as any ZEP or STONES staple from the same era. The mighty WAILERS, featuring future stars PETER TOSH and BUNNY LIVINGSTON figure prominently in the mix, but it's the master humanitarian himself that gets every message across with ear-grabbing grace and hypnotic beauty.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE SPLIFFS
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Just ok!  Different approach, not what I expected. I think the author was off on realistic Zombie science. But on the other hand, I appreciate the whole world wide epidemic thing he has going on.
B001EC2J20|4.0|Not as good or as conceptually whole as the first Matrix. Action packed but stumbling in its attempt to move along the plot towards the final sequel.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The Hobbit is completely different from Lord of the Rings, so if that is what you are expecting, you may be disappointed.  However, anyone that is familiar with the book will likely enjoy this movie.  Peter Jackson and team have, yet again, produced a cinematic masterpiece.  I look forward for the next two movies!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander has written  very interesting story.  Because of his medical background, I found the book a bit too technical, which made it a little hard to follow.  I sincerely hope, however, that his account of &#34;Heaven&#34; is accurate.
B00000AOTZ|5.0|If you love the movie you will love the CD. It's a classic, same as the movie, both are masterpieces.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not as depressing as the book since the characters and their relationships are more realistically presented through visual presentation rather than imagination.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its a great game I love it I play it on my friends phone all the time but I really wish it was free for a day or so
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I found Skyfall to be a fun, action-filled, fast-moving thriller. For someone who doesn't watch many movies, this provided all the entertainment I needed for one night.
B009SSGBOE|4.0|I really enjoy Donald Fagen's musical style and jazzy groove.  I was pleased to see he's released something recently and it did not disappoint!  Only 4 stars because it isn't something i am compelled to listen to continuously, but when I play it I do enjoy.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|As usual, Sandra Bullock is wonderful in this film, as is Ryan Reynolds.  Betty White, on the other hand, is the whole show. Her charm, whit, and expert acting cannot be equaled.  Without a doubt, one of the best pictures I've ever seen.
B000002O1Q|5.0|Is great to listen to the music, if you like the movie you will love the music, one of the Icons.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is an essential piece of software for he Android platform. Coupled with the Amazon Cloud, I can ready my eBooks anyway I am at any time.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|The cubes rotate flawlessly; there are enough different cubes to test your short term memory but not so many as to make it frustrating. I like the sound and visual feedback the app gives when you select the cubes; makes me feel I am playing an arcade style machine, especially when I use a stylus. This is a game good to relax with, but challenging at the same time.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Love Love LOVE Walking Dead!  Item was in perfect condition, just as described.  Thank you! I can't wait to watch all the bonus features
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I loved reading things that have gone through my mind, but are not commonly discussed in the marketplace of ideas.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love this app. helps me sleep soundly and get there fast. like the night and thunder combined the best. lots of sounds to choose from tho.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was interested in what it tells about the soft S&M world -assuming it's more or less accurate-, and somewhat intrigued by Grey's flawed personality, but all in all, it's a pretty basic love story between two almost teenagers.
B009S33I68|5.0|Great companion to the movie. Wonderful in-depth presentation of all aspects of the character and battlefield. Have read it more than once yet always feel ready to read it again.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It's sleek, entertaining and intelligent fun and it requires a degree of creativity usually not necessary for most puzzle games.  Good Stuff
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I just loved this book.it was well written and very well told.there is a message in it. I told all of my friends about it.it is excellent.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|My feelings towards this gem of a book are summarized in this quote by John Green: “Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.”<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read it!! But, don't do what I did (I practically flew through the pages). Rather, savor each word, each letter, and each character. You will be sad to leave the world of Guernsey, you might as well lengthen you stay.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great. If you have Xbox 360 minecraft and pc minecraft this app is a must! It is a great way to create anything you imagine. This app will be money well spent.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Anyone who has had a fairly rich sex life would find this book silly, &#34;vanilla&#34; as Grey himself might put it. It's pretty basic, and you get tired of the same words being used over and over again -but then I guess there's only so many ways to describe the same thing... I completely turned me off. I decided not to read the 3rd book.
B0060CV31C|5.0|Another great family movie, my family can't seem to get enough of animated movies! I would definitely recommend movie and online streaming purchased movies, especially if your kids love to watch them over and over again!
B0017HEYEI|1.0|I cannot even use this DVD. My son was do disappointed because he could not understand a word. There wasn't even an option for English. Total waste of money
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I like this game so much I just want the full game so so so badly I can't even wait
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app helps me sleep, it could sound a little crisper, and some of the repetitive sounds repeat at slighltly too often a rate but otherwise it is a great app for sleeping.
0385349947|2.0|The book was very poorly bound, looks as if it had been made in a hurry. The external long edge of the paper is all at different lengths, as if the pages have not been properly and uniformly cut.<br /><br />I was surprised that the book was not available in digital format, especially given the industry the author works in.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This product is just what it seems, a reliable, durable charger that fits the needs of all types of people from a commuter to an adventurer. I use this battery quite often from when I'm camping to when I'm traveling and even when I want to walk around my house but still have my phone being charged! Great product, I recommend this highly to anyone looking for a reliable portable charger at a very good price!
B0057LUI0O|5.0|We not only love the movie, but we also love its soundtrack! I'd much rather have my kids watch movies we can watch together than have them watch regular TV shows and this is an awesome one.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|My son has not stopped watching since we received this in the mail. Great quality. Sound is perfect and the picture is great too. Just as I remembered it.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|smartly conceived fiction that is just a breath away from the kinds of things that could happen if we continue exploiting earth's resources without any check.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|This was a strange film. It did not make any sense. I could not even finish. It was like watching a silent film. Not what I expected from Ben. Do not waist your money like I did.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is a nice way to spend the time viewing something that doesn't have violence and gives you a dream world that was real a little bit less than a hundred years ago
B007SGM084|5.0|Thank you for such an amazing set of books and frustration from life. Very highly recommended to all the women I know!!
B007C94XG4|5.0|Alvin and the Chipmunk movies are always full of lots of fun and laughs. Amazon has made it easy for me and my boys to enjoy family movie time.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I love this case.  It's pretty orange.  And the kindle can swivel within the case.  Pretty awesome.  Got it on sale.  Winning!
160788576X|4.0|I listened to the book he wrote after this one first.  It picked up righat after this one ended. It kept referring back to what happened in West Virginia so I had to get this book to find out what happended.  I was not disappointed.  The book had lots of action and twists that kept you guessing.  definately recommended it.
B00A822VDY|5.0|I thought this movie might be scary for my toddler, but she loves it. In fact, she would watch it all day long if we let her. It is the first full length movie she has sat through, and she pays attention to every word. The movie is funny and appropriate for her- I feel comfortable letting her watch it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first I didn't think I would like it. Amy was so perfect. But as the plot unraveled I found myself predicting what would happen and Sometimes I was right and sometimes I was wrong.<br />I thought that it had some interesting view points on marriage that you seldom find in books.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|It didn't hold my interest, excellent acting though, Sally Field poorly cast, in my opinion. Watch it for the acting not the story line.
0446541478|5.0|Fledgling democracies are tough to understand for most people. Israel is one of the most difficult economies to really get to know. This book is a great first step. It tends to be more focused on what the Israeli economy does right without some of its weaknesses. Still, it is well written and very informative. Further, the premise of the book continues to be proven right as some of the best product and software innovations we see hitting the market today are coming out of Israel.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This book is not Grisham at his best, but it will hold your attention and give you the satisfaction of rooting for the underdog.<br /><br />As usual, Grisham paints a picture with his writing and his in-depth knowledge of the legal profession shows through.  There are always clear cut protagonists and antagonists in a Grisham novel, but in this one, he includes considerable nuance with a lot of fuzzier gray areas.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say if you enjoy Grisham novels (and many of us do), this one will not disappoint.
B004VFN72S|5.0|I love this movie. It is tense and fascinating to watch. The characters are well drawn. The acting is great - and especially enjoy Harry Connick, Jr. as a bad guy.
B00005NIL9|5.0|For me the song &#34;All Right Now &#34;is probably my least  liked song on the album. Heartbreaker is my favorite Free album but Fire and Water still deserves 5 stars. I heard it in my teens years ago and couldn't get enough,it was my introduction to Blues rock. Mr. Big,Heavy Load,Fire and Water all shine and then there's the single All Right Now that just exploded on the airwaves that summer. If you like this pick up Heartbreaker their swan song. Also the re master is done very well,the sound is quite good.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Much anticipated premiere was great as always the twists and turns are amazing. And it was good to see all of our leading characters once more.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app.  The app has never crash on me, and I love the Android mobile format.  Super handy.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I just started reading Balacci again after many years. I read the reviews that the main character was too similar to Lee Childs character Reacher, so I went in with lower expectations. This was not the case, Puller has some similarities to Reacher, but then many charters like this have simlarities - it depends on how the writer is going to develop that characters personailty.<br />I think Baldacci has done a good job with John Puller Jr. He is compassionate, yet has a rough side.<br />I won't get into the story, but it is well developed and the end of the book has you staying up late reading to see what happened.<br />I have now read 2 other Baldacci books since reading this one and I can say I am a fan
B001H5X7KC|5.0|The film industry's greatest achievement, and its not even close! Why Jack Black missed out on Oscar night is beyond belief.
B00AY5B712|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the past decade. My family & I watch it fairly frequently, when we need to laugh and when we want a touching and funny story with hilarious characters. Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister is wonderful. Bill Nighy as the &#34;over-the-hill&#34; Rocker is outstanding.
B00992CF6W|3.0|it is not like Pc or xbox360 but its how I started playing mc. get it as a begening thing for Pc it is still dealt fun
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I rented this film yesterday, and I have to say it was far better then I had anticipated. It has comedy, adventure and action all combined in a very nice way as not to be too violent or bloody. Children of all ages should be able to enjoy this film. A must see! Some of the scenes are absolutely spectacular!<br />The bluray: Picture Quality:10/10 Sound 10/10.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a well-working application, but the tiles are written in such a funny script that my eyes don't automatically recognize the symbols.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|While some didn't appreciate the latest in GRR Martins song of fire and ice saga, I found it a satisfying continuation of the narrative. Now if only the next book doesn't take 7 years....
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app is fine for weather updates. However since installing it I am now getting a lot if targeted ads. I find this to be very annoying. I will be unistalling the app for this reason.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|i really don't llike this whole 2o word minimum. I would like to rate this as a five star series and leave it at that. what can i say you either love or hate this show. i enjoy the performances, was a fan of the books and enjoy their interpretation of them. Peter Dinklage steals the show with his performance as  Tyrion Lannister
B0006B2A42|5.0|I had forgotten how good these movies were, this was a follow up of a purchase of Where Eagles Dare by the same Author.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|For those of us in this age range, this is definitely good for some laughs.  Why is there a minimum number of words for reviews?  Annoying!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought this book would be cliche but was looking for a light romance without a supernatural story line. I got more! This book was adorable. The characters believable and like-able. The love story sucked me in; and the romance and light sex-scenes kept me intrigued so thoroughly that I couldn't put it down until it was finished. Love isn't perfect but it is real and so nice to read about and dream about, especially when it doesn't come easy- like in this story. Beautiful story and a delight to read. I absolutely recommend this book if you are looking to smile and feel your heart swell with love and anticipation for a sweet story.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. I enjoy 70's movies and this movie decpited that era perfectly. Great addition to my movie library.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I am not sure about the accuracy of the movie because I hated history. Having said that, this movie was a combination of a wonderful script with wonderful actors. Definitely worth watching.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This is what Excellent drama on TV looks like. Why don't we find more programs like this for our money?
0062238868|5.0|I ordered this book before Kyle's most untimely death.  A great person and sad what happened.  My husband being interested in military was not disappointed and was impressed though his first reaction before the book was that Kyle was stuck on himself and his ability--he went away from reading the book impressed what a great man he was.  Hightly recommentds reading his autobiography.
B00887490Y|3.0|Starring Jessica Biel as Julia. A nurse that is determined to locate this mysterious figure that has been taking away children. Very atmospheric. Cert 15. Contains violence and swearing. You might also like Stephen King's It, Jeepers Creepers, Sinister, Case 39. Lance Heinreksen and William B Davis also star. They've been in some great shows, Millenium and The X-Files both created by Chris Carter. Set in Cold Rock, a small town that is pretty much isolated. Plenty of deals on Amazon. Feel free to see the other reviews.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This movie is scary as hell, make sure you don't watch it alone.. Sinister has everything to scare the pants off you!!
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I have seen the play several times and loved it and adore the music.  This movie did not do justice to either.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It was a real page-tuner but couldn't believe the ending!  Amy is evil and evil needs to be punished!  There were many ways to bring justice and to think they were bring a baby into this sick relationship is just wrong!
B001P5M7QE|5.0|A classic, brilliantly written film.  Made on a shoestring budget these guys made it work with the script and acting
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Great actors, good story, but could have been wrapped up better in the end.  Love it enough to watch it again and again though!
B003VANOFY|5.0|They work great for me.  The wireless feature is important for me.  I can roam around while still connected.  I use speech to text software, and these work soooo much better than the standard one that came in the box with the software.<br /><br />Love it.
B00ARN0ZF0|5.0|After the 4th movie you would think this is getting old, but somehow they have created a great story, and the chills and suspense needed for yet another paranormal movie.. Great work..
B008DVJO8C|5.0|My first CD from this band, and I love them.  Their energy and their innovation coupled with dynamite lyrical style has won me over.  What a great performance, from first song to last!
0425252868|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and coming to understand how both the American pilot and the German pilot viewed the war and their roles in it.  My only grip would be that the book focuses heavily on the German pilot's point of view, portraying a very sympathetic version of the German Air Force. I would have liked to have \\"gotten to know\\" Charlie Brown, an American hero, as well as I came to know Franz Stigler.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is the most fun game that I have ever played. It is worth the purchase. I highly recommend this game, it is for all ages.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I just got all the original movies on Blu Ray so you know I had to watch epi 22, the start of Khan!! Classic star trek fun!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Absolutely love the game, could play for hours, but in order to do that you have to pay :-(  money is tight<br />in this economy. Invite friends that also have to pay because they enjoy it as much as I do? Not happening, I want to maintain my friendships!
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Iron Man does it again.. Robert Downey delivers a great performance yet again, in the soon to be iron man trilogy.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Ahora entiendo porqué ganó un Oscar de la Academia a mejor fotografía. Desde Avatar no veía algo tan bueno. La historia es muy emotiva...El Blu-Ray capta todo esto: una pieza imprescindible en la colección de todo cine en casa.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I've been using this at work for over a year and it works perfectly. It fits my maglite xl 150 perfect and it has held up very well. Highly recomended if you carry a small flashlight often
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|This is ok to fill in when you can't find any thing else to watch. Story was ok acting ok. More shocking then scary, it will have you hanging on and guessing what's going on. Mild horror movie that the non horror movie fan can watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a story.....I could not put this book down; captivated me from beginning to end.  This book is about strength and survival. Although it is fiction, it truly touches on the evils of abuse that go on in the world and the many lives that are affected.  A must read!
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie is so well done and covers such great subject matter I've watched this movie a number of times. I love Sandra Bullock's protrayal of this fiesty Christian women.
B00821OX98|5.0|The show is very fast paced and keeps you wondering what if going to happen next.  I just finished season 2 and looking forward to season 3.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|One of the most intriguing books I have read in a long time. I am astounded by the suffering endured by the North Korean people for decades and thankful for a glimpse into their lives.  No one could doubt the evil of socialism and it's relationship with totalatarianism after reading this book.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I realize we're not here to rate the merit of the music, but the product, which is the ease of buying and downloading the music and the quality of the mp3s. Tops in both cases.
B00BESNKB8|5.0|I don't know if this was released at the Cinema, so it didn't get much publicity, if it had I would have went to the cinema to watch it. Great English language, star studded Movie. Rent it and enjoy. Still had the Chinese themes, and plots. I would love to see more like it.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I have long been a Kelly Clarkson fan and this CD was the perfect way to get all the songs I had already loved plus the 2 new ones.  The Cd was well packed and arrived very quickly.  It is now in constant rotation in my CD player in the car.
0553378384|5.0|I'd been told about this 1997 publication for more than 3 years.<br />Finally bought a copy.  Then I bought one for my sister.<br />Excellent view of one important aspect of our astrology based on Jan's interpretation of North Node's influence.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|_ played for about 30 minutes then it crashed and that was weeks ago and it still won't work. if it worked it would be great
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|This is a great family movie.  Our 10 year old and 8 year old love this film.  It was the perfect movie for family movie night. Highly recommended!
B009UNH0EM|4.0|Second cable really does help when switching locations not having to worry about running out battery.  Connects to usb charger at home and on laptop in all locations no problem.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|this is my favorite group of singers ever. and now I have to fill the rest with words so I can hit send.
0062082353|4.0|I like it because it is a easy read, great story.  Chris Kyle is a hero in my eyes. thanks Chris
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Could of had a better story line other then the entire movie based on the 13th amendment...more to the man then movie offered.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I don't really understand this one. If my 6 year old grand daughter were around to explain it more I would probably play it.
0062238868|5.0|Purchased for my mother and step-dad, who both read and loved it.  They said it was a book they couldn't put down.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|This wraps it all up quite well. The second book really is completely redundant - there isn't any plotting in that that couldn't have been crammed into either this book or the first. But a solid resolution, I guess.
B00846REIS|5.0|Much better than shades of grey! Characters were more real, better writing ,less S&M, more love and emotion. Must read!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a wonderful read.  I believe this book is suppose to be for children.  However, I highly recommend it for adults as well!  Great lesson in it.  :)
0307477479|5.0|this book is highly intelligently laid out. loved it!!! best book I've read in a long time. couldn't put it down
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Easy to set up and pleasant alarm choices. I wish I could keep the display on all the time. It is nicer than my regular clock.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|We saw &#34;Rise of the guardians&#34; in the theater with our son and his family.  we all loved it.  I thought it would make a special Easter gift for our 10 year old grandson.
B000003BD3|5.0|This is a good CD.  My husband heard a song from it on satellite radio, and came home requesting it.  I quickly found it on Amazon, and almost as quickly had it in our living room, enjoying it.
0062238868|5.0|Not for the faint of heart.  Thank God that we have people like this, but I feel sorry for them, people who love to kill!
0307730697|5.0|I can't remember when I have ever been so moved by a book.  I did not know Adam Brown on this earth, but I wish I had.  Fearless is the perfect title for this book.  The path to his ultimate and untimely warrior death was not an easy one, and that he was willing to allow his story to be honestly told tells so much about the man Adam was.  Mr. Blehm so clearly put in to words the feelings of Adam's family, friends and teammates that by the time I finished reading the book I did feel like I knew Adam.  This is an extremely well written book about a true human hero.  Not a sport star, or a movie star, but a true hero.
B000O9GJ4I|5.0|Some of the most beautiful music in the world combined with one the best voices on the planet.<br />They made several albums together. Mostly European most people in America don't know who they are together as a team. One of the best collaborations of all time. And I am a music professional. Amazing, wonderful, uplifting and almost spiritual it is that beautiful. Listed to some tracks.
B008K7WCJM|5.0|I did not expect the Swans to come with new music . I thought the they split. I love this band and this album is great.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I always enjoy these books and this was a great buy and my purchasing experience was wonderful!  I would recommend this book.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|this calculator works really well.some calultors for the kindle font have all the signs but with this one you just write/draw it and it shows you what the answer is.I recommend this app so much.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my daughter and she was excited to receive it.  She has begun watching the episodes.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This is a raw telling of American past, it really brings to light the dark times of slavery but had an interesting tale to tell. Christoph Waltz was superb.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is the first book I read written by Kiss publication. I laughed and was entertained, but mostly because you can visualize this really happening in Vegas. I couldn't put this book down.
B006VP1OYO|5.0|I like this band., they one of the bands that did new music. This album is for fans not for every one. I like this album.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|I liked this book because it seemed close to reality.  It did get into some scientific jargon that lost me at times.  Overall a good story to follow.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Fun to listen to he does cute things. I would recommend this to others to have and use for fun.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best Bingo game! Its highly addictive. And has new updates and new rooms all the time. Plus its fair with giving u bingos.
B007FXLWKW|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS TOO CUTE AND FUNNY. MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT.<br />WE WOULD RECCOMEND TO ANYONE.<br />GREAT MOVIE FOR EVERYONE WITH KIDS.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This a fantastic Bond.  It brings together more of the scars that he carries in the past two films to bring him to the edge of his tolerance for the service and sacrifice he has to make as a spy.<br />Bardim is also at his best as the bad guy.<br />Daniel still has what it takes
0124297854|4.0|I got this book with good price and very good service, even though there is some printing problem inside the book.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Not quite five stars, but better than four. Simply brilliant. A 100 year old man on an adventure full of Forrest Gump experiences; throw in dozens of world leaders, some explosions, Einstein's dim-witted brother, an elephant, and lots of vodka. I was in stitches through the entire book. The character of Allan will forever be with me, and I am grateful for that. Don't hesitate to buy this feel-good, awe-inspiring book. Enjoy!
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|The song Dig is amazing, one of their best. The rest of the album is typical; lackluster music from aging rock stars. Love Hurts is pretty good also.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Wit, humor and lots of behind the camera tid bits. I also appreciated the real life issues presented in a true Tina Fey style. I wish we could be neighbors!
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Really off-center for DeMille, but an entertaining read.  Witty and easy to follow.  A great escapement read requiring no thought or reasoning skills.
1582701709|5.0|This book gives valuable insight into the power of positive thinking.  It contains many examples and testimonies from people who have first-hand proof that your own attitude can change your life.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Great condition works perfectly exactly as described like new I enjoyed the movie very much. I will look forward to watching more of his documentaries
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Forget The Dark Knight Rises, this was Tom Hardy's best performance I'd ever seen him in. The movie is original and I don't think anyone can predict the plot or outcome. A few dull moments but overall definitely one of my favorite movies and the best part was that I wasn't expecting it.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Amazing book! Jack London is an amazing author! I also liked the book White Fang also about a dog! So Cool
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Another hit, great story line, great cast, Classic Quiton  Jamie Foxx delivers another great performance that shows his deversity  he can play anything
B00C7KYXHW|3.0|Despite its similarity to other shows created, it manages to stand alone.  This is my new addiction.  The show is about a person who can literally put himself in other people's shoes.  He is a teacher/ ex-FBI agent who is called back to help solve a case.  He is asked to see a therapist (lector hannibal) to make sure he can live with the images he sees, after the case is complete.  I caught up on the show at NBC.com<br /><br />Update: Ok, the show is starting to lose my interest.  I am going to give it another chance, but if it doesn't pick up the pace I am finished.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|The above line says it all for me. I enjoyed Argo it had a better pace and kept my interest.
141694737X|3.0|I thought the flaps on the pages would be bigger, so was not so impressed with this particular book.  The order was processed fine.
B00BP3DPJY|4.0|Great stuff. Original, new-age alt-country for the kids today. Spacey, deep, orchestral, beautiful, lyrical. If you're thinking of buying this, you already know you should.
B008476HBM|5.0|Appreciate the Classics as you get older. Hated this book when in school and you had no choice but to read it, BUT, choose to read it as you age gracefully and really appreciate it!
159562015X|5.0|This book and the survey are truly amazing. It felt like they have known me all my life - it is very accurate. I especially like that it stresses the positive and not weaknesses.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Long time Tolkein reader now buying the movies.  After seeing the 3-D I was disappointed.  Read the book again, bought the DVD - and found that without the distracting 3-D effects, the story took over again.  Loved the casting.  Movie flies by.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book!<br />The games were the most exciting part of the book it took a while to get there.<br />Anyway good book
0394818237|5.0|I ordered this book for my granddaughter's first birthday as I had this for my kids.  The book price was fair, the delivery was fast and service was great.
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|I love this album from beginning to end. This feels like a solid continuation of 'Nothing Is Wrong'. With other artists releases lately, I've been lax on enjoy their new material, but this I was able to jump right in.<br /><br />Taylor Goldsmith's lyrical ability is strong as ever and the instrumental dynamic between the instruments is spot on. Taylor has commented in interviews about how he'd switched up his playing style on guitar and the methods he's used in writing with a guitar, it truly shows how he continues to grow in his ability and style.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever:) I let the seven year old I babysit play this game and he loves beating my high score.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|The usual laughs from the Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Judd Apatow, Leslie Mann, Melissa McCarthy and co.<br /><br />Not bad for a Sunday night on the couch, but not their best work.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|This is a Hollywood epic - sweeping visuals, great music, hits all the buttons.  Makes you want to bend the old bow and take a shot again for FREEDOMMMMMMM.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Never really felt I wanted or needed a gaming headset, but I figured I would give these a try. They absolutely blew me away! I bought them over a year ago, and use them every day. It's a totally different experience when you play a game or watch movies with a headset like this. I eventually got some Sennheiser HD598's to use with the 7.1 processor that is included with the x41's and it's even better!<br /><br />I use these for watching movies and tv shows more than I do for gaming, and I don't think I can ever go back.<br /><br />Only downside is that if you want to use these for Blu-Ray movies, it can be a bit tricky. Most Blu-Rays have DTS-Master Audio tracks, with which the x41 is not compatible. If the Blu-Ray has a Dobly Digital 5.1 track included, you're in business, but typically that's not the case. Worst case scenario you have to use the stereo track on the Blu-Ray, which works just fine, but you can definitely tell the difference in the quality of sound.
B000KIPD5E|5.0|Works fine. I hooked two different guitars to the input sides and can switch back and forth as needed.  Only it did not come with a power supply, had to get one from Rat Shack.  About a week later Amazon sugested a cheaper one, but I'm happy now with what I got.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|A great book full of stories I never heard before, about presidents I lived with.  One of the best this year!y
0307594777|3.0|I found that they were all much to long and boring in most parts. The 1st book was extremely boring in the first 100 pages. It took too long for any action to happen. An over-abundant feeling of reading a research book. Once the action started, it was an ok read. Book 2, was a little better as far as action happening sooner rather than later. I hated the ending. Book 3 was the worse of the trilogy. I can't say that I like any particular part. The whole book was rather boring.  If I hadn't already purchased the set, I would not have read book 2 and 3.I  would not recommend buying this book.
B007P6VM04|3.0|I am happy with  this recording  Well put toether and excellent quality recording<br />Happy with this product  Truly future stars

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game ever  you should play it pics are in face book get it or your lost olny for $7
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game.  The first time I sat down with it I lost 2 hours of my day.  It's easy to learn, easy to play and easy to master.  I've never had so much fun eating unsuspecting swimmers and divers (watch out for the divers though, they fight back sometimes).
034580404X|5.0|I could not put the books down. I loved the trilogy. Love it. Love it. Love it. It changed my view of the subject matter. I would definitely recommend the set.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a book that you must have if you intend to publish an eBook on Amazon. If it doesn't answer ALL of your questions it will at least provide enough information that you should be able to figure out what to do in most cases.
1481913417|5.0|I had had this book before but after giving it to a friend never saw it again. Must be a great book indeed. Helpful to those who wants to polish his writing style.
6305784116|1.0|This disc was badly scratched and would not play and was thrown away the same day as received. I thought I was getting a new disc , but to my dismay received this product which was not even close to being a selling item. It should never have been on the market and I feel the seller was dishonest.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I LOVE this app!  I have a sound soother at home but whenever we travel, I have a hell of a time sleeping in a strange hotel room.  This app turns my phone into a sound soother.  It has a timer and a huge variety of sounds, both environmental and instrumental.  Plus, you can combine individual sounds into a custom medley which can be saved in a favorites file.  Perfect!
B008J34466|5.0|Another great song (and album) by one of my favorite female singers.  Pink will not disappoint you with her most recent release - I downloaded the entire The Truth About Love CD!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Amazing read. Great book with excellent information and advice. I highly recommend this book to any aspiring long distance runner.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|The game was fantastic I mean really fun but I ran out of levels really fast and decided to buy the expansion pack and I got more levels then the next day I wanted to play world 10 and when I got on it said I had to purchase it AGAIN so I wasted a dollar so if you can give me a refund that would be nice but unless I get a refund my review will stay at 1 star.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|The product was in unused and new condition. I had heard such great remarks I wanted it form my collection.
0385474547|5.0|This is not your typical novel.  The language, style, and syntax are definitely not American/European.  That did take me just a bit to get used to.  But as it reads on page 7:  \\"The art of conversation is regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which words are eaten.\\"  Throughout the book, proverbs, metaphors, and descriptive language paint the picture of life in the African Ibo culture.  In places the language of the book is biblical feeling.<br /><br />I will admit the very foreign names of the characters were sometimes difficult to keep straight, but the personalities of those individuals came through for me.  The main character, Okonkwo, is a flawed character.  He might not be admirable, but he was definitely believable.  The interaction of the characters is not what we are used to, but isn't that the point of good literature--allowing us to become someone so totally different than ourselves.<br /><br />The first part of the book sets the stage for what happens in the rest.  The reader is introduced to Ibo lifestyle and thinking.  The accidental killing of another man turns the story sharply into a new direction.  Now we see the Ibo culture directly up against western civilization.  But it didn't turn the book into a good culture/bad culture clash.  It simply portrayed the fear of change from the familiar to a life of total contradiction from what was long believed to be true.  And how many today are struggling with that same fear of the future which is turning over what we thought were truths?  This is more than just an outward struggle between the Ibo culture and the white Christian missionaries.  It is the struggle of one man's life as the things fall apart around him.<br /><br />I especially appreciated the author's portrayal of the missionary Mr. Brown who spent hours talking with the Ibo.  \\"Neither of them succeeded in converting the other but they learned more about their different beliefs.\\"  Wonder what our world would be like if that was the norm rather than the position taken by his successor, Mr. Smith.<br /><br />The ending of this is almost anticlimatic, but so well drawn.  The Commissioner and Okonkwo may be from completely different cultures, but their pride and hopes for their own future are cut from the same cloth.  The last sentence revealing the title of the Commissioner's book is irony that slaps the reader in the face.s the norm rather than the position taken by his successor, Mr. Smith.<br /><br />The ending of this is almost anticlimatic, but so well drawn.

0307352153|4.0|I think every introvert needs to read Quiet - it validates, and gives you confidence in who you are as an individual. The world needs us, they just might not know it yet.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A must read for anyone studying business. Steve was a genius and there are lots of lessons in this book for life and business.

B000O59AFC|5.0|I like the Blue Ray quality of picture and sound.  It's a movie worth watching more than once. A classic!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What's not to like?  A great continuation of seasons 1 and 2.  This is something I have shared with many friends and family members who are deovted to the show.  It is well worth buying; you will bring it out again to watch over and over.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|i have loved this movie since i first saw it years ago. when i watched it recently i saw that alvin straight is a version of me. my longtime partner watched it one evening without me around and said &#34;don, alvin straight is you.&#34; the movie is a classic simple beauty. richard farnsworth was superb even with his deteriorating health.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Yet another terrific mystery by Patricia Cornwell set in Boston and surrounding area.  Always great intrigue and mystery with my favorite characters.
B00008EY7H|5.0|because it is a great show. Not My fave, but top ten! Everyone should see a cirque show at least once in their lives.
B007VUCAVO|2.0|Thought this would be great to have. Shortly after installing found all that info was neat. It didn't take long to realize it was draining my Kindle battery very quickly. The extra info wasn't that useful. Deleted it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Like the action. East to read.my kids would like this book. Has a host of new and interesting characters. A good all around job
B00499QUK2|5.0|I actually love the fictional character Sherlock Holmes. This modern version does a good job at bringing him into the 21st century.<br />Love the character's deductive theories and the thrill that he gets from being correct.
B004SIP9E2|3.0|SCARY MOVIE is the first and some might say the best in the SCARY MOVIE franchise. SCARY MOVIE 5 was recently released so the franchise lives on. The original SCARY MOVIE was funny stuff when it was released in 2000--a humorous parody of recent horror movies. Much of the movie focused on SCREAM, especially the murderous villain. A group of over-developed high school students are being stalked by the killer. There is also a take on I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and a few other films but a parody of SCREAM seems to be the main focus here.<br /><br />Horror movies, especially those of the past 20 years or so, tend to follow a varied version of the same storyline. SCARY MOVIE reminds us that we usually know what is going to happen to our teenagers and one female lead is the main target. SCARY MOVIE takes the predictable to the absurd level.<br /><br />No doubt one of the funniest aspects is that the hooded villain's white face mask changes expressions to fit what is happening. He even gets invited over to party with some guys. Could it get more silly?<br /><br />As the years have passed, some of the references to specific movies may have faded in people's memories though since we have the constant storylines in horror/slasher films, the references are not lost. Sadly, what was a silly slasher scene in a movie theater now has new meaning after recent events. The silly scene can no longer be funny.<br /><br />SCARY MOVIE probably will be more enjoyable to people who remember seeing it when it was originally in the theaters..when the world was kinder and less tense. Things have changed through the years and some of the violence being joked about no longer can be looked at as absurd humor.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Awesome...<br />Can play all day and night<br />Haven't seen another flow to compare ....bridges...Ok. but this.....words....words...<br />Even my four year old plays
B00555X8OA|5.0|I wish I had read this book 30 years ago; of course it didn't exist back then.  I have recommended this book to many people.  My only concern is that at almost 500 pages very few people will make the time investment to read it.
B004FQX59I|5.0|Wonderful movie.  Very good movie which presents a lot of what did actually happen in Dallas with some interesting fictional theory injected.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book at times broke my heart. I kept hoping Victoria would have found someone to care for her as a young child. By the time she meets Elizabeth there are to many tough times for Victoria to trust what is being offered.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Love Never Dies is a beautifully photographed movie, with stunning sets and costumes.  The songs by Andrew Lloyd Webber are memorable.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B007REV4T8|4.0|Best of the Daniel Craig &#34;Bond&#34; movies to date. Less gadgets and more character development than other recent &#34;Bond&#34; movies.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game!!  Very addictive...easy game play and easy to level up.  Great game to waste time while sitting in a waiting room.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I liked it - my granddaughter loved it.  I believe she watched it 6 or more times in 48 hours.
B006512BFU|5.0|I saw a trailer for this film far before it's actual release and was immediately excited to see it. It seemed like a riveting story and the cinematography was superb. Luckily, the movie easily met my already high expectations.<br /><br />As a forewarning, if you are uncomfortable with sexually explicit scenes or content, you may want to stray from this film. The graphic content doesn't reach a point of x-rated pornography but it definitely doesn't shy away on the sexual content. Keep in mind that though that the sexual content heavily pertains to the character and narrative so it is very much so a warranted aspect to the film. This film focuses heavily on Fassbender's portrayal of his character struggling with sex addiction and how it affects his relationships, as well as, himself<br /><br />I remark that solely due to a personal debate I had with another as to the necessity of the sexual content in the film. That being said, do not be deterred by the introductory emphasis on the graphic content in this film. It is, in my strongest opinion, a masterful work by both the director and the cast.<br /><br />Fassbender nailed his character to the teeth. From his body language, to his facial expressions, to his natural flow within his movements and his dialogue, he managed to highlight the strengths and traits of a sex addict perfectly. When his character shows weakness, it's evident how much it pains his character. Many of my friends often complain about how actors are horrible at crying but, in all honesty, I found Fassbender's portrayal of emotional turmoil to be spot on.<br /><br />As for Mulligan, she coincided with Fassbender so easily that I completely lost any disbelief in the film and legitimately believed in their characters. Her back-and-forth dialogue with Fassbender flowed so naturally that it's easy to lose yourself in their relationship. Although Fassbender is main protagonist, Mulligan definitely deserves some notoriety for her abilities as an actress in this film. Her performance is easily as impressive as Fassbender's.<br /><br />Regarding cinematography and aesthetic elements in the film, the film really creates a unique atmosphere with it's locations and environments surrounding the narrative. Characters decay into darker places but it's often the case that characters fall apart in the brightest environments. The correlations between atmosphere and plot development are both unique and intriguing. The shots themselves are artistic and well placed. They fit naturally alongside each scenario/plot point and never become a nuisance. As for the audio and music, the voices are clean and dialogue is clear; however, music is always entirely up to one's preference. There will be many moments of silence and they definitely play into the natural feel but I personally loved the ambience.<br /><br />Please note though, that this is a PAL, Reg. 2 disc as it is mentioned in the title. If you are an American customer, you will need to reformat your laptop or device to be able read PAL (unless you have some converter) so be prepared for that and look into ways you can get around it.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think this film is a masterful piece. Fassbender and Mulligan are certainly two actors the world should take note of as their performances in this film were absolutely marvelous. If you haven't had a chance to see this film, I highly suggest you get yourself a copy and check it out. Just be careful when viewing it around others due to the sexual content. In the end though, I loved this film and I hope you guys love it as well.is film.

B000002LFZ|5.0|Such an awesome c/d and all the best of there songs! Great service and delivery at an even greater price that was so affordable. Was so happy with this an the listening pleasures of the greatest bands of the 1970's
0143122916|5.0|Shin Dong-hyuk was born, bred, and raised in Camp 14 in North Korea. Amazingly, he escapes the Camp 14 which it's existence is still denied by the North Korean government and into North Korea and later China. The story of his life is quite fascinating but sad as well.<br /><br />Shin's life was born into a living hell in Camp 14, one of the worst camps in North Korea. Shin's earliest memory is that of an execution as a toddler. A few years later, he witnesses the execution of his mother and brother. Executions were mandatory public viewing by the camp prisoners. Camp 14 prisoners had no access to the outside world or little knowledge of it. Shin has no idea of the world outside Camp 14. Like others, he is malnourished, tortured, abused, physically, mentally, psychologically, etc. Shin survives the camp by being hopelessly accepting to his situation. He knows nothing else and suicide would be punishable on his father.<br /><br />His escape is no less a page-turner. You wonder how he will survive the months in a prison within a prison as a nine year old child. Shin's childhood is full of painful memories of eating rats, insects, starvation, slave labor etc. He trusts no one not even his own family. His actions would later result in guilt over the executions of his mother and brother. Not that he spent time with his parents, he and the other children never experienced the unconditional love or love at all.<br /><br />The memoir about Shin's life is important to understand how North Korea works from the inside. North Korea is a country where the people are mostly underfed and malnourished as part of the government's control policy. Shin learns about life outside Camp 14 where he could find food, work, and live. When he crosses the border into China, all is not great but he is not being beaten to work. He has the freedom to come and go.<br /><br />Shin's life after Camp 14 is no less easier. His adaptation of life afterwards is difficult like most North Koreans. He seeksasylum in South Korea where he receives citizenship. South Korea does provide a program in helping North Korean defectors escape and adapt to life in the South. But North Korean defectors have spent their entire lives in paranoia, fear, and mistrust of even their own family members.<br /><br />But this book's remarkable candid honesty about Shin's guilt over his role in his mother and brother's execution is his everlasting punishment for following rules. When you read the rules in the end of the book, you find it hard to believe that Shin and others survive such inhumane conditions where they have no recourse or sense of life outside the world or memories to guard them. There is experience where Shin befriends an older inmate who becomes like a father figure to him and gives him some hope. Shin lives on very little hope from complete hopelessness to a life possible outside Camp 14. Without his partner and friend Park, he barely escapes Camp 14.<br /><br />In the end, you hope and pray for Shin who is pretty much orphaned in this world. His father remains a prisoner in Camp 14 and who knows what his punishment for his son's escape might be. Shin escaped and worried about being caught in North Korea where he was pretty much sure to be executed for his escape. Shin's experiences after Camp 14 are no less exciting as a young man who experiences freedom for the first time. He is no longer hungry or starving like in Camp 14. He feels guilty for those he left behind. He has become a human rights activist and admits his part as a 9 year old child who snitched on his mother and brother who were planning to escape. In hindsight, his mother and brother escaped in death from the horrors of Camp 14. In death, they are finally free.<br /><br />Shin is a survivor and will always be. He has a mission to help free his North Korean brothers and sisters who are still imprisoned by a dictator and the totalitarian government who uses torture, starvation, and paranoia instilled in it'scitizens. When North Korea is free, maybe Shin and other North Korean defectors will be free as well. Still, North Korea needs the outside forces to free those who haven't experienced freedom. The people are starving where as the government is building nuclear weapons to the evil West. Sooner or later, the walls will come down and North Korea will become free. It's only a matter of time before a revolution or Civil War happens.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|First off, this is an official followup to the original Bridge Constructor, developed by Clockstone. Clockstone developed this version and teamed up with Headup Games to distribute it. Both companies' logos appear when starting up the game.<br /><br />Secondly, the app permissions on this game are not bad, and are actually pretty standard for a game app. It has internet access for posting scores to Facebook (optional), and doesn't have access to any personal data on your phone. It also doesn't have any ads, aside from a link buy to the original Bridge Constructor game from the menu screen (if you call that an ad).<br /><br />As for the game itself, it has a basic tutorial section (the first world is called Tutoria) that introduces you to new concepts and new materials. However, it doesn't hold you hand in terms of bridge design and pretty quickly expects you to design bridges without any guidance. It's very much expecting a trial-and-error approach, where you may not succeed on your first try, and encourages experimentation.
B00821OX98|4.0|A little Dark in the begining, but really good show would recommend it, it sucks you in. I wish they did more episodes a year then just 10
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the disgusting bloody zombie killing action. My hubby and I laugh at all the ways a zombie's head can get smashed in. This season was darker than the first two in my opinion.<br /><br />I got tired of Rick going crazy after the death of his wife. I wish that lasted only an episode or two. Also, I hated the fact that the Governor wasn't slaughtered by the finale. Man, that prick got on my nerves but succeeded as a good bad guy.<br /><br />Anyway, I look forward to the 4th season. You can bet your butt that a slew of people will join us at our house for that debut.
B003VBNN7C|5.0|Good acting, A movie that tells the story without bad language and little sexual situation. Enjoyed the music and story line

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This was an alright movie. The comedy had its ups and downs but definitely not for everyone. Worth renting it.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|I enjoyed the 40th edition as much as the first !!  What wonderful music and stars.  It gave a true vision of pre war Berlin.  When the young man stands up and starts singing my blood runs cold.  A movie for everyone..
B004WR125O|3.0|I plugged in the wireless adapter and connected to my home Wifi network. Took a bit of trial and error to get the security info set for my network. I have used both the Android and iPhone apps as remote controls and to stream music.  However, after verifying that they work, I have not used them again. Having to get up and switch the mode to USB is a minor but significant barrier to use. I have not tried streaming music from my network or from any Internet services.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My hole family likes the games. So many to choose from. My 4 year old even has fun trying to play some of them.

B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Probably sometime before 1950, there were no grocery stores as we know them today. So were was all the food? On the farms of course, as America had many more small operation farms and farmers then, and in the family gardens. In this new century in America today, our food comes from large farm corporations and distribution centers (think WalMart). There is no way to really know what is in our food, how it was produced, grown, or treated, what unwanted or harmful additives were introduced into it, how the food was modified (think genetically), or how our food animals were treated.<br />Aquaponic Gardening can be done by almost anyone, anywhere. This book shows step by step how to grow your own food at home. Educational, fun, and it puts food on the table! A must-have book for those self-reliant and sustainability motivated.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|the price was right shipped promptly recommend this cd and the vendor<br />the music is Hawaiian authentic and you'll feel like you're in Hawaii.

B0081336FO|5.0|Seriously, I can't get enough of this series! Long after the episode is over, I'm still thinking about it and wishing there were more than the 2 sessions.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Really, I would give it a 3.5 simply because the shoe being phenomenal continues to get better as it goes on.<br /><br />The cast? Perfection.<br /><br />The writing? Incomparable.<br /><br />The plots? Thought provoking.<br /><br />This is show is really really good and I'm happy its available here.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I just received my sonic, but so far, I'm loving it. It's very easy to install batteries, switches cleanly from closed position to open, and the pens are running great. The only reason i didn't give the full 5 stars is that it emits more of an ultraviolet  or purple light than what I expected (blue) other than that, this product is amazing.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I love it all but I have read the books so I know what is going to happen and so much has been left out of the 2nd season that I am constantly explaining to my husband who the characters are and what the plot line is.  The first season went more slowly and set the stage.  The second season has skipped over a lot of detail that would explain much to the viewer.<br /><br />Still, if you are a Game of Thrones fan, do not hesitate.  And if you are a fan and have not read the books, get on it!
B0053O89WY|5.0|LOVE it and yes I would recommend this product. It is great for anyone who loves a different and refreshing type of comedy.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Nice special effects. Movie drug on a bit. Gave this a lower score because I prefer a complete story link in a movie vs a series. IIf I come across the next chapter, I will probably watch, but will not plan for it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thought it was very well written. Although it doesn't have a happy ending as the film does it's still entertaining.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow!!  Electrifying!  I could not put this book down.  The best book I have read in years.  Landay does a remarkable job of capturing the inner life of this family.  I highly recommend this novel.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I'm a big Lord of the Rings fan.  I love The Hobbit and have seen it twice in theaters.  The blue ray copy is beautiful and having a DVD copy included is great.  The ultraviolet digital copy is good in case you lose your dvd or you want to stream it on another device.  The order came on time and was exactly as advertised.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I spent the last two weeks of my life reading this book. First, I will tell you why it even took that long, as a book that I describe as \\"perfect\\" should keep me up all night until finished. The reason is that the first third of the book was rather slow, and instead of reading it straight through, there were a few nights that I found something on TV or to do around the house and didn't get around to it. Once I got past that first third though, insert my night of insomnia.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the beginning was slow, this book was absolutely beautiful. There were so many elements that make this a perfect read: mystery, love, deception, anger, betrayal -- all woven tightly between storylines of two eras that come together at the end more beautifully than I could have ever imagined.<br /><br />I won't reveal anything about the book because everyone should absolutely read this as uninformed as I was. However, I will say this - it is now my favorite book ever, of all time. At the end, I tried to explain it to my husband but I couldn't because of how in-depth it was. I kept trying to explain it to him, with a ball in my throat because I was holding back tears at how touching and somewhat haunting this book was, and finally gave up. I would never have done it justice!!

B000FCKBCU|4.0|I was looking for something mindless to read. Though the plot was formulaic, I had fun reading it and just passing the time. And I think a lot of folks can learn from what I felt was a over arching theme of being a slave to your job, but not enjoying your life...the here and now.
B004U52VPS|5.0|We've ordered it twice: for our 6-year old boy and as a gift for 5-year old girl. You can play it by yourself or with friends. The pieces are not too small, so we do not have to be hysterical when our baby is crawling around.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app works well enough, not sure it's much of a step up from the mobile web site. Really is more for the convenience of not having to load up the web browser every time you want to get on Facebook  that makes it somewhat worthwhile.<br /><br />It's just like every other Facebook app out there. Nothing new. Anyone who has used a Facebook app out even the mobile site will navigate this one with ease.<br /><br /> I do seem to be having trouble with the chat bar, it keeps pushing to the right until I eventually can't see it at all. Then you must reset the app to fix the problem. (Ie shut it down with an app killer)<br /><br />Also seems to load the news feed a bit slower then normal. (In comparison with the mobile site)<br /><br />For that it gets a three, it's neither very good nor horribly bad.<br /><br />Basically if you don't want or have the time to start the web browser  and type in the url every time you want to update your status get this app. Otherwise stick with the mobile site.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|My nephew loves this game!!!  Easy for kids to do by themselves!!  He is three and figured it out all by himself!!!

B00395ZYVS|4.0|I wasn't expecting to enjoy this book, but I was engrossed with it from the beginning. Worth taking the time to read.
B00B3HJLX6|4.0|This cd is better than the original cd they did. I have to say they are better doing covers than originals.<br />Mike Portnoy is awesome of course. One of the best drummers of all time!!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|It is a good case and it protects my iPhone well but it distorts some sounds and some people that I call complain that they cannot hear me that well.

B007A4SDCG|5.0|I'm Buddhist so the &#34;God&#34; references have to be adjusted in my mind as I read, but I felt freer to create after reading this book. Got my mind off the pressure part of things and reminded me that creativity is a gift that is meant to be used and shared with others :)

B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book held my interest-I couldn't wait to see what happens next. The undercurrent of the former husband lurking in the background created just the right amount of suspense. The ending was movie-grade spectacular and I could see a film being made based on this story.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|The story held my attention-I have two sons and could only imagine what it would be like to have one of them accused of murder. You think you know your child until something like this happens-then doubt creeps in. The ending had a great twist-this is a great summer read!
0684824906|5.0|A well written biographical portrait of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln by Goodwin that I first listened to on audiobooks and thoroughly enjoyed. I then chose to buy the book for future reference--which I have done a number of times.  It is a big book, but well worth the time it takes to read.  Students of history, the civil war and the presidency in general or specifically to Lincoln's decision making process before and during the civil war will enjoy this book.

B00B4VXQC8|5.0|After attending one of Bon Jovi's concert in my local town, I was hooked on this CD. He sang almost all of the songs plus his well know and loved oldies. It was awesome and this is a great memory.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|I continuously play this CD and  I think it might be Susan's best yet. Love all of the songs on it.
B0000252YK|4.0|While detractors do have a point - that The Ultimate Sin is a little too slick and generic at times for its own good, what they rarely point out is the veritable orgy of phenomenal guitar riffs and flourishes, articulately assembled by the underrated Jake E. Lee.<br /><br />Sure, choruses like \\"Never Know Why\\"'s tepid \\"we rock!\\" chant and \\"Lightning Strikes\\"'s equally embarrassing \\"rockin' all night\\" refrain elicit cringes, but the muscular musical backing, led by Lee's front-and-center metal riffs, tend to counterbalance these quibbles.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album, first-rate music is indeed matched by thoughtful and insightful lyrics, such as \\"Secret Loser\\" (an honest examination of the singer's battles with alcoholism, most likely penned by ghost-writer and bassist Bob Daisley) and the anti-nuke anthems \\"Thank God for the Bomb\\" and \\"Killer of Giants\\" (the album's epic centerpiece). There are enough of these inspired moments on the album to recommend it, and fans of incendiary, 80s-style metal guitar playing will be enthralled throughout.
B001MSMULG|3.0|The good guy didn't seem to be able to out-think the bad guy.  Not a bad read, just wished the good guy could have kicked the bad guy in the teeth at the end
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book was pretty good. People who are into guns and the military  would really like this book. I liked the movie better, but they were from different perspectives.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Very different.  I did not realize that in some cultures flowers have a way of speaking to people when one does not want to use words.  Of course the receiver would also need to understand the language.
B00AEBB8LA|5.0|One of my all time great movies. Robert De Niro is great and the way he reverse the plot was sicken
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It is a good story ... Teenage love evolved into age long companionship- how does one not enjoy this read?<br />:)
1780721676|4.0|This is a good, informative book, also written with humor. He talks realistically about losing weight and how his method works. He gives a lot of information based on the research he studied . He also gives a list of simple recipes that can be used and bought from your local supermarket.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|What's not to like with Hugh Jackmen in it. I have seen the theatre production also but did enjoy the movie also.
B003YJF08G|4.0|this is the book being used for my financial statement analysis class at webster university. it's a easy enough read with a good mix of technical terms and layman wording for the non-CFOs among us but you must have a solid foundation in finance. i do really appreciate the real world examples used to apply the concepts
B002N5N5LG|5.0|If you are a new community fan and enjoy the show, you'll be blown away by this season. The first season of Community is amazing. The episodes are different each time and add edgy comedy, crazy characters, and various parodies that make the season zip by with no 'slow episodes.' Overall this is one of the best seasons of this amazing show!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|While the history part of the movie was fascinating the movie was two and half hours long.<br />I did like the candle light effect.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|April 16 2013<br /><br />I had the Bible in my phone once before but ended up letting myself get side-tracked,never again will that happen.Thank you for the blessing..
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Loved it!  Wonderful movie to watch with my sis and daughter n law.  Three generations.  A movie that spans the generations.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|The movie definitely has funny parts. I think most kids would not find it very funny as most of the humor seems to be aimed at adults. Parts of it are a little slow, and the character development is a little patchy. But overall, a good movie to keep back and relax to and have a few laughs along the way.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book kept one thinking...did he do it? What would I do if it was my child?  And a surprise ending!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This movie was suspenseful, intriguing, unique--and scary.  Scary is the main reason I watch a horror film.  Very Gothic!  I like Gothic, and I understand that darkness is a Gothic trait.  But I don't understand why the whole movie is in darkness, as though the characters never heard of electric lights.  Sometimes it's laughable what they do without a light on--cook, clean, office work.  Still, I was engrossed in the movie until the end, and had some good scares.  I highly recommend it.
0141327766|4.0|I thought it was a very good book.  I enjoy reading it and following along with the movie. I would tell other to buy it.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Enjoyable grown up Bon Jovi.  Good songs great listening time.  Really glad I tried it.  Bon Jovi still going strong!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Did not so much like the ending felt like it was unfinished, but overall good book! Would recommend to anyone.
6300213005|5.0|I thought is was a very good movie. I enjoyed watching it very much, and I loved the special effects.
B00501LD5U|4.0|I like the book. I thought it was funny and witty. I would recommend  this book to any kid who enjoy adventure.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|excellent show, writing is wonderful, Actors are great, I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes SYFY. And Guarantee that you won't regret it...
0345803507|5.0|I actually think this is a bit tame, but am thrilled that others are loving it.  You can easily grow fond of these characters and, as a woman, put yourself in Anastasia's shoes.  Of course, when's the last time you were approached by an unbelievable gorgeous millionaire with a little bit of a fetish?  Still, it's good, fantasy reading.
0307266303|5.0|Loved this book... especially the stories of various ultra runners and the tribe athletes.  The 'how man evolved' part was a little hokey but the rest of the book made me want to go out and run!
B004FEFS5E|5.0|this book talks about very basics for photography beginners:<br />the photography triangles: aperture, shutter speed and iso values,<br />it talks for the 3 within 3 top chapters, with aperture, it explained<br />the concept of depth of field very well, for which aperture f/3.5-f/8,<br />f/8-f/11, f/11-f/22, you get &#34;story telling&#34; depth of field, &#34;who cares&#34;<br />depth of field, and most of depth of field;<br />this book also have some extra chapters talking about light, frontlit,<br />backlit, and how does lighting meter work, brother blue sky, Mr green<br />jean, different topics are teaching for beginners very well, as well as<br />some latest technology like HDR as eletronic flash nowadays on<br />every camera; strong recommendation.
B0097UGXFK|5.0|One of the most intriguing ,unusual,moving,different,suspensful and suprising stories I have ever read or seen.  I immediately bonded to Katnnis the main character I can not wait for the next part &#34;Catching Fire&#34;!!I know it will be just as teriffic!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Powerful stuff.  A gripping work of historical fiction that kept wanting to read more and more.  Hardly noticed how lengthy it was!
B00AAAKH80|5.0|FGL is great! Every song is awesome and I can listen to the album over and over again! Definitely worth the money!
B004WEHEAY|5.0|Can't beat Eric Carle books~  this one is somuch fun, with an activity to share on every page; I can kick like a donkey!.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It takes awhile to get into this show.  If you can't get past the first 4 episodes of the 1st season, you'll become addicted.  I Think this show has real character.  I get excited to watch it, and there aren't many shows I get excited to watch anymore.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Been through it twice and we still laugh out loud...perhaps the best written series ever and well acted as well.  I'm not usually a fan of sitcoms because they're simply not funny...BBT ins a delightful exception!
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|I'm not fond of superhero movies. By definition a superhero is near indestructible and the final outcome inevitable. So to succeed with a super hero movie requires super creative writing. Fortunately for &#34;The Avengers&#34; the script focuses on the human element - our weaknesses, our egos and ultimately our strengths. In short our heroes need to become more than the sum of their super powers. Everything about this film worked for me. The script is fast moving, clever, witty and entertaining, allowing all the superheroes some quality time in this movie. The director (Joss Whedon) is simply masterful. By comparison I watched, back-to-back, the last outing of the the Transformer series of film - The Avengers is a better film in every department.<br /><br />Nit-picking is always fun however. Notice the helicarrier has a flight deck that terminates directly over one of the lift fans. Can you imagine the down draft that creates for departing / arriving aircraft?
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|I tried cuz it was free app o the day. It's a nice simple game to pass the time but I like puzzles with more of a challenge.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I felt that Sheryl Sandberg wrote convincingly about the difficulties facing women in the workplace and society. It was interesting reading about her personal experiences as well. Although she champions women's roles and abilities in professional domains, she doesn't preach that it is the only way to live life. She just seems to want women to take their rightful place at the top as easily as males do.
B0006Z2LP6|4.0|This is entertaining. It's like watching a live-time documentary. I've seen documentaries of Apollo 13 and find this movie a better way to 're-live' the events of the crisis. Not as dry as most minute-by-minute 'just the facts' presentations by the documentaries.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|I'm not an average &#34;thriller&#34; viewer, but I did enjoy this one.  The performances were very believable and the plot believable and easy to follow.  As the story unfolded, the tensions just kept building till we literally were sitting on the edge of our seats.  My husband also enjoyed this film, and he's more of the target audience.  Would recommend it for sure.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Ilove this game and can spend hours each day playing. I would recommend this game, to play while waiting to see a doctor, or perhaps when one should be listening to a professor lecture.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I gave this a four star rating because it works well, but the cord is stiff, not flexible like my previous one.
B006678VWA|5.0|I got this movie for my son's family. His family had all the other Harry Potter movies on DVD/Blu=Ray except for this one which I obtained at a great price on Amazon. Amazon makes it easy to afford to spoil your kids and grandkids (and even yourself sometimes).
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The story has potential, but the setting was too unbelievable.  The acting by most was good.  Not great.  I'm glad I watched it, but it is not one I would sit through again.
0812550706|5.0|First read many, many years ago...bought for elementary school son of friend and it still has the same appeal even after all these years.  Never was able to derive as much pleasure from rest of books in series...but Ender's Game seems to be forever wonderful.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Quick pick up of crumbs between regular use of vacuum.  Easy to use and battery charge last long.time.  Recommend it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Wholesome music (compared to what's out there). I'm happy to buy new CDs for my granddaughter as long as it doesn't have unsavory lyrics or vulgarities as do many genre
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|These guys are extremely underrated, although they do seem to be getting an appropriate amount of attention for this release.  Excellent album, especially if you were a fan of their self titled album from the mid 90's.
B00006RCSR|5.0|for me? this is a great old love storie, it will make you cry & make realize what  u have.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|There just aren't movies that are this well done any more.  The writing and humor are great for an easy laugh.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I liked this Step Up 2 version as much as, if not more than the original Step Up. The original had a great 'main couple' story line with a few good side characters. Step Up 2 had a main couple but more stronger side characters involved -- more like a 'group' movie with  2 main characters, Both are good movies. I've yet to see Step Up 3 or Revolution.
B003U9TDII|5.0|simply put, I'm really feeling the soundtrack, the movie was AWESOME and so are these tracks... If you enjoyed the movie then you'll love the soundtrack...
0792839129|5.0|this is a great family movie just for every body to sit down & watch it's so funny, you'l love it.
B000FA675C|4.0|Exciting story with twists and turns.  This fictional novel encourages the reader to think outside of the box.  Anyone who likes puzzles and deciphering clues in a treasure hunt will love the journey and pace.  Robert Langdon's character is Academia's Indiana Jones, without the whip.  He uses his mind to find the treasure.  Enjoyed this story, the book better than the movie.
B00000F566|5.0|There are a few chick flicks out there which are must haves. If your lady doesn't have Dirty Dancing yet - get it for her ! If you ladies don't have it yet - buy it. I recently saw it a few times on TV and at least one of those times they edited parts of scenes which I felt were important to the plot. You won't have that problem if you own the DVD. And, NO COMMERCIALS
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is a really fun game, my wife and I have scoring contests we are about even. Great time killer while waiting at the airport or DR.'s  office
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I recommend it to anyway who dares venture into the unknown world of spirituality, finding your soul strengths, when traveling solo.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|when i first got the headset I really liked it.. very good sound quality and very comfortable to wear. after about a month of use people started complaining that is sounded like pop corn popping from my mic. i acually to different gioteck mics and both were doing it at the time so i dont know if it was the headsets or my connection or what but that would be my only complaint.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I saw this movie during a recent visit with my son's family. I am happy I was able to find this affordable copy for myself on Amazon. I like the Avengers and the Transformers more than the X-Men (tho they are okay). Not knowing much about Captain America (I was mostly a Hulk fan from way back when (before the Bixby TV series even)), it was neat to see this movie and learn more about him. I like the part he plays in the new Avengers movie also. Still, he hasn't replaced the irreverent Iron Man on my like more list.
B00BJ7G1VK|5.0|Have made several recipes and love them all.  Have watched her series on Cooking Channel and the book works right along with the show.
0307591549|4.0|Great book and principles. Writing is good, but sometimes it takes Shawn (author) way too long to say something he could have say in two words. It runs in circles a little bit and over explains the same thing over and over again. But, I loved the principals and I am starting to apply them. Great theory about how your attitud towards happiness changes your lens in how you see your life, you just need to keep it a habit so it is part of your life.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this organizer for my city mini. It's perfect and a fraction of the price of the baby jogger brand. Cup holders are big, love the zipper compartment and I have plenty of room for my keys, wallet and snack. It fits my stroller perfectly and I keep it attached when I fold the stroller with no issue.
1423140605|5.0|My now 13 year old granddaughter is an avid reader. Last year (2011) I bought her a boxed set of one Riordan series. She enjoys keeping up with the other Riordan series and this book was on her Christmas/Birthday (Dec/Jan) wish list. I'm blessed to have granddaughters who love to read.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. Once again, where I aim and where the ball ends up are world apart. I don't like it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie is great for kids and parents! There are references to old games only parents would know! Super cute movie good for boys and girls! My kids love it! And I just bought it because the youngest loves it so much!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie. Not sure if I feel it ranked at the top. But overall a good movie. It was great through to the ending, but anticlimactic in the end.  I guess there is a sequel coming
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Several friends join me as we have watched through the Downton Abbey episodes.  I would encourage the HD version next time for clearer quality.  There really is a notable difference.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|I enjoyed it but after I was done I had to think for a while, I wondered if I had just wasted a piece of my life with this book.  I came to the conclusion that I was entertained with it but if you have anything, and I mean anything, important to do...do it, this book will always be here.  I would not recommend it for someone who doesn't have a very open sense of humor unless you just love zombie stuff.
B008J34466|5.0|This is one of her best albums.  I love all the song on it and most of all, I love PINK's creativity and her style of singing.  If you are a PINK fan, you will love this album.
B00797MB0O|5.0|A movie that isn't happily ever after. It shows real life. And although it is not your typical happy ending story, watching it lifted my spirits. Probably because I'm not a former homecoming queen trying to steal a married man in my home town.
0061730327|4.0|Love and romance novels are more my thing, but I would read this story any day. Great stories within, quick read, informational and motivational as well.
B000VX4X3G|5.0|I wanted to buy these shoes for a while. The size fits perfect. The color was as expected. Comfortable to walk in and wear for hours together. Happy with my buy. Would consider buying again in another color!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|It is a quick way to find what you need while on the go. Would recommend if you have children in school.
B00340I4KG|5.0|the premise behind this movie is really interesting. to switch 2 faces to gain entry into a gang is incredible.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|terrible  waste of money<br />Panders to race based humor multiple times but doesn't deliver.<br />Seth Macfarlane's ego is way to big
B00BHMF578|4.0|Great great movie.  I was pushing it off for some reason but I think I knew It was going to be good.  I just had to be in the right mood, I guess.  Watch it, it will not disappoint.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|While I would still like to buy hard cover versions, with original illustrations, in this case I just wanted to revisit some old friends, written by Defoe and Stevenson. Everyone should take advantage of Amazon's generous offer to download to our Kindles the classic novels. Of course you should get the real books for your library, or the newly published ones for your Kindle, as the new versions often have very nice extras, however these stories stand the test of time because they are great! Download them now. Read them, treasure them, reintroduce yourself to quintessential characters, and remind yourself why the hacks of today steal from these books. I am going to copy the same review for Robinson Crusoe and Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great plot, gore, twists, and Characters you could definitely relate to.  If you don't like this....well you may be a walker
B0069JBKHI|5.0|This is the best of its category by far after looking extensively on the web. image quality is excellent,installation easy. to be able to bring it to friends withtou having to take the charger (works on battery for 2hours) is great.
B000L212HC|4.0|This is a great mystery movie where you're never sure who is more crazy- the &#34;protagonist&#34; or the &#34;villain&#34;. In fact, you're never sure who to root for either, because while Jackman and Bale have sympathetic moments both characters are so obsessed with out-doing each other as magicians everyone else in their lives winds up paying a large price. The film unfolds in a non-linear chronology that may require multiple viewings, but it holds up well each time.
B002ZG98UA|2.0|This movie i found was just thrown together as if they wanted to make some quick weekend money. Stick with the first 3 movies They start to die off at this one.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The Wheel of Time has been a fantastic book series that I've been working on for nearly 10 years.  This book was an absolutely perfect ending for such a fantastic series.  All the characters, all the prophecies, and all the plot points wrapped up better than I had hoped.
B00946XX28|5.0|so glad this album finally available for dl :) daft punk is awesome m m m m m m m
B000002OX3|2.0|The Who were still finding themselves when they made this album, and still learning how to record their sound. The album is pretty crunchy and has a poor sound quality. I was particularly disappointed by the album version of &#34;A Quick One While He's Away&#34;- the version on Live At Leeds is far superior. The standouts on this album are John Entwistle's songs &#34;Boris The Spider&#34; and &#34;Whiskey Man&#34;. Aside from &#34;So Sad About Us&#34; Pete Townshend's songs are forgettable.<br /><br />The bonus tracks with the remastered version Include songs from the EP Ready Steady Who, and the B-sides &#34;I've Been Away&#34; (another Entwistle standout), &#34;In The City&#34;, and &#34;Doctor, Doctor&#34;. As a completist it's nice to have those.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|this is a nice movie and I really like the three disc version - I don't have a blue ray player yet so played it on my DVD player and love the quality, etc. - I even have a portable DVD player I use at my office, put this in for kids that come in with their parents and keeps them quiet. Definitely worth the buy.
B00005NKK8|5.0|I love this movie and the soundtrack is a wonderful reminder of all the magic in the story.  Old favorites.
B004S49YVU|3.0|There is sameness to the Baldacci plots, but this one defied credibility in places, a bit too pat in its conclusion
B0018AO9A8|5.0|This is Dire Straits deepest album, and maybe not for every listener. It certainly features the band's hardest and most epic rock offerings, along with one of their darkest in &#34;Private Investigations&#34;. The band grows very large with piano and keyboards becoming essential elements to their sound. Following this release Dire Straits would lose drummer Pick Withers and would never quite sound as great again.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Felt like I was  back I time with Jake every step of the way.  Fast paced.... keep you up....type of read !
B00BCOGM78|5.0|I have been listening to these guys for almost 20 years, they just keep touring and getting better and this album goes back to the basics of a driving base line and killer hooks, love it.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I love this movie. But I wished his time there showed more before the 4 Years Later showed up on the screen. I love the movie because it showed his survival there; coconuts, fire, hunting fish, and Wilson the volleyball. I'd say my all time favorite part was Tom Hanks stranded on the island surviving.
B001NS5F62|2.0|I'm not sure what happened to Mark Knopfler between 1985 and 1990 but at some point he forgot how to write Dire Straits music. This album fits in much better if I think of it as Mark Knopfler's first solo album rather than Dire Straits' last. Up until On Every Street Knopfler would utilize a country twang amongst a variety of styles with complex and rich arrangements. From here on out it's pretty much all boring country blues with very little expansion. One exception is the title track which stands as the last great Dire Straits tune, a swan song for one of the truly great bands of all time.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard.I have listened to it every day since<br />I received it a few weeks ago.His mastery of the english language is incredible
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved every minute of this tale and can't wait to read the next. Mr. Martin has real talent and an imagination which wows the world!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN I RENTED THIS MOVIE THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT.  IT WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL STORY ABOUT A DOG WHO WAS A JAPANESE AKITA WHO BECAME VERY ATTACHED TO HIS OWNER AND WAS LOYAL EVEN AFTER THE OWNER DIED. I WON'T SPOIL THE STORY LINE (BASED ON FACT BUT WITH FICTIONAL CHARACTERS AND LOCATION), BUT THIS TYPE OF LOVE AND LOYALTY BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES.  I HAD TO OWN THE MOVIE AFTER I SAW IT. A MUST SEE.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book discusses some of the same studies that I learned about in my college Psych classes, it's all very new and exciting research, that is changing the way we see ourselves. I absolutely love this book and would highly recommend it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is a French film - subtitled in some scenes.  The primary characters are a VERY wealthy, well educated, quadriplegic  gentleman with a brilliant mind, a great sense of humor and warmth, and his nurse/caregiver, a young, poor, black man who becomes a lifelong friend.  The caregiver frees his patient from feeling dependent and restricted by his devastating physical situation: he gives him adventure, excitement, fun and life again. He never treats his ward like a cripple, but rather jokes with him irreverently about his circumstances.  He also introduces him to the tastes and challenges of his own black subculture.<br /><br />This film is SO much fun!  So touching.  Both characters grow and learn and risk.  I laughed so hard, that some scenes left me in tears  (or was I crying from emotional release?) The screenplay is biographical - based on real individuals.  Makes it all that much better.  I bought this film for some of my friends, too.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|This series is remarkable.  Hobb is able to create a world of unique characters but the themes speak to our own struggles as a country and as individuals.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel Washington was amazing, the movie was intense yet held some humor. John Goodman was so right for his role. The movie was good, but the streaming was constantly buffering. We have high speed, tested it and it was up and running fine...we stream through Roku and it was also fine, Netflix and Roku programs work just fine. Would love Amazon to address this buffering issue as they have newer, better movies than Netflix for streaming, but not fun to watch with all the interruptions. It is an ongoing problem that probably could be fixed with some ingenuity on the tech staff.
B00000DCHI|5.0|This has more hits than most Greatest hits. Billy Joel best music. He is the music man! If I was told I could only bring 1 CD with me this is it!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|tried other alarm apps.  this is the best.  needs more alarm sound options.  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx assessed. ffffff.  fffssbh Fd ggff fggg fgg.  gffffssjf.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Wonderful CD.  Very old school.  If you like Adele and, or Amy Winehouse, you will love this artist.  Great value.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons! It's funny and twisted enough to make you think. No other explanation needed.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Bourne! Do I have to say more? This is a NON stop action DVD. I suggest putting it on pause  to get pop corn or anything else because it moves so fast you will miss something! A must have in the Bourne series.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|100% deserving of the Best Picture Award that it received.  Full of action and suspense, and very true to the time in which it is set.  I wish I had seen it on the big screen.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I listened to this CD this morning on the way into work.  I can listen to it over and over and not get sick of it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything about this season 3 is wonderful, but there are some very dark moments.  Not to be missed, tho, if you've done seasons 1 & 2
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|AWESOME GAME! Especially because it's FREE, today!! Easy to learn how to play with Tutoria, the first island. Usually, this isn't my sort of time-waster, I'm not a fan of Angry Birds, but, this is a fun and easy to learn/play app. So, get it and try it, it's FREE!!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I knew this movie would at least be entertaining, but it was quite gorgeous.  I really like the way the dwarves' characters are developed in this movie -- in LOTR, they were pretty much ignored.  Bilbo is still one of my favorite heroes, and the locations are breathtaking.  The scene in the beginning of Erebor, the city inside the mountain, reminded me of the scene in FORBIDDEN PLANET, when Dr. Morbius takes the captain and his second on the tour of the fabulous City of the Krell.  Wow.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Free play has kept me going thus far with no real need to invest real cash.  Plays at a reasonable speed.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I lost interest in this book. No offense to the author, I am not in the write head space to read it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|While the last 4 episodes seemed a bit drawn out, overall the series is excellent.  Each season gets better and better!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This series is awesome keeps me guessing . I cannot wait to watch the other seasons. It reminds me of the series Friday the thirteen.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. So much so that when it came out as an entire series, we purchased it on BluRay and gave the entire series to a friend who was recently divorced and was looking for replacement (his wife got the series in the divorce.) it is a great addition to our collection. Cheers!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|We really enjoy the realistic portrayal of vintage periods.  Attention to detail is exceptional.  Looking forward to the next season.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I purchase very few games. This one I gladly paid for and am looking for more from thus developer. Well done!! Great graphics, story, puzzles. One slight dislike, having to travel all over the map back and forth near the end.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Good app just wish it had a spell check in the word program and also a synonym section for writing papers
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Love the relationship between Castle and Beckett... Watch an episode on my Kindlefire at work, during lunch<br />almost everyday! Sometimes, it's the best part of my day  :)
B006ZNRD06|1.0|I don't like this app! The videos buffer forever! And it sucks because I had to purchase it!! Hopefully this gets fixed. I tried to change the settings to see if it would work better but no luck.
B000XZ3YH8|3.0|For the cost, its a cute buy. My daughter loves to play since , Daddy plays. The strings don't stay tight or hold tune, which is fine since she can't play anyhow. We are also currently down to 2 strings. We knew she would beat it up, that is why we went with cute and cheap, not function. She really enjoys it at 20 months old.
034580404X|5.0|I had absolutely no trouble and loved the condition, speed and easy process ordering.  Thank you so much.<br /><br />Easy to order and Best thing I've ever done.  thank you so very much.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I always enjoy well structured novels. It treats a recurring sociaty ill in a very positive way. In a world of child abuse news is good to know there is good people willing to help.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I love FOB and have been a fan for a long time. Tbis cd isnt like thier old ines but its good. Ive bee  listening to it all day.

B000I2JI80|5.0|This is awesome 120 film. I use it in my Holga GCFN camera. The colours turn out vivid and beautiful.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Ordered for the granddaughter...she loves it as I knew she would.  Best thing I've ever done.  Easy to order and delivered very quickly.  Thank you so much
B00947N6UG|5.0|I'm not a movie reviewer but I liked the film.  Entertaining to both adults and children.<br /><br /> What I REALLY like is that it comes in both blu-ray and dvd formats.  Very handy for those running both types of dvd machines.
B002MY9NF0|1.0|Dropped to 1 bar, then shut down in the middle. I can stream from netfix fine, but Amazon has got to do something!
0399160450|5.0|Tom Clancy is unparallalled in depicting war scenarios and they almost look realistic.  While reading his books, we enter into a different atmosphere.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|Fun, fun fun!! It was just the ticket for the blues I had. Once the movie was finished my blue mood was sun filled. ok for kids too.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|A completely different movie than the Stallone one.  The action looked good and was plentiful.  They even put in a rudimentary plot!  Not bad at all!  Grab some popcorn and sit back and enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it ten times better the first temple run boss to to to to to to to to to to to
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very entertaining, thought provoking, quick legal thriller.  I found myself thinking about the premise of a genetic predisposition towards violence and the disturbing ending of this book days after I finished it.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|I am completely addicted to this trilogy and am champing at the bit for my next &#34;hit&#34; of Kvothe.  More!  More! More!
B009AMALLM|4.0|We all know the story.  If you like the Paranormal Activity series you will watch it.  If not, don't buy this.  Nothing new here.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I read this book from cover to cover in one sitting.  It is an easy read.  Great for just passing time.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|I am a fan of Mr. Rothfuss.  The main character Kvothe is a rare combination of mystery and all too familiar characteristics.  So he is a character that can easily be related to whilst remaining fascinating.
B00AA8Q0FQ|3.0|I have a very old dvd player (region 1) that intended to play this on.  It didn't work.  It did, however, work in my newer region 1 players (and the computer) just fine.  Maybe I just need to shell out $20 for a newer player.  lol.
B00BESCJII|5.0|This movie wasn't epic, or mind blowing, not even amazing. But it was really, really good. I thought every actor in this movie did terrific in their roles, and I genuinely enjoyed watching this movie. I just watched it a couple of weeks ago, and already could watch it again. This cannot be said for most movies I see. If you haven't seen it yet, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is worth 90 minutes of your time.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|This was a great purchase, I was ecstatic about it! Reasonably priced and great quality. I thought this purchase was stellar.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the show. I will continue to watch the next season when it returns, I'm glad I was able to watch it at Amazon.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I didn't start out a fan of  Walking Dead, but my kids &#34;forced&#34; me to watch the show.  This season was heartbreaking, mind-blowing etc.  It was a good season.  Can't wait for the  next one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was in middle school, and have read it almost every year since then. When I was younger this book appealed to the kid in me who loved the idea of being able to go into a zero gravity battle room and battling it out with fellow students. Now over a decade later nothing has changed. Every time I read this book it gives me that same feeling I had as a kid. It is a great book, and I know every other guy I have recommended it too have said the same thing. This was probably the first book I bought on my Kindle simply because my paperback copy was so beat up from reading it year after year, and being lent out so many times, worth every penny. Now I hope the movie (coming out in November) is half as good as the book.
B00BF11STU|5.0|It was interesting to see how it alll went down the capturing and killing of Bin Laden. It will be a great movie for history.
B00A83075M|5.0|This DVD was a great purchase for the library.  I can not keep it on the shelf, as soon as it comes back it goes right back out the door on another check out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is great for children to learn the responsibility of horse keeping. Otherwise it is free I rate this app five star!
B0095T3H2U|4.0|I probably am a little biased since I love every actor in this movie so much from other roles they have done, but I really liked this movie and thought it was very under rated. It is pretty long, but it never felt slow or dragged out to me. I thought it progressed perfectly and even though some of the situations were exaggerated or a little ridiculous it still felt completely real. This movie takes you through the ups and lows of a relationship that at times has you laughing out loud and at other times just shaking your head. This movie is definitely not for everyone, but I loved it and have already seen it more than once.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|It is a great movie and series to watch with the grandkids. Its funny, silly and has a lesson in the end.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This DVD was a great purchase for the library.  I can not keep it on the shelf, as soon as it comes back it goes right back out the door on another check out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awesome game I always put minecraft videos on youtube this is just as good as PC if it just gets some updates and it will rock! Can't wait for all the new updates I SAY ANYONE WHO IS READING THIS GET IT AND LETS BE FANS FOREVER!
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|As every musical artist matures, it's hard to recapture the glory of what first made you fall in love with their music. Justin Timberlake has long been one of my favorite artists and is an inspiration to many. NSync was a good boy band, but Justin really hit his stride with his solo effort. Many parts of Timberlake's last album, 'Futuresex/Lovesounds' took my interest in dance and shoved it head-long in to choreography and professional dance.<br />While I like that Timberlake is embracing his own sound and has really found that niche that works for him vocally, I do find myself missing dance tracks and the energy that propelled his previous albums. Thank you for embracing the jazz, but please bring some dance music along with you!<br />'The 20/20 Experience' is not a bad album, it's actually very good. Excellent producing, great sounds and vibes, yet it lacks much of the energy I've come to expect from Timberlake. '20/20' is just part 1 of Timberlake's two-disc return to music, so I'm hopeful looking forward, and I fully intend to purchase part 2 as well. I just have to be okay with these albums as listening albums and not dance albums.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Have enjoy the Downton Abbey Seasons. I enjoy the old castle and how the working of a royalty house works. With alll its drama.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I can not keep this movie on the shelf longer than a couple hours here at the library.  Every one who has checked it out loves it.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I lost my husband and was heading to Ireland for a vacation and my daughter got this for me.  The moving on of this young lady was wonderful and I am glad I had watched it prior to going.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Part 2 of the Animated DC Universe title 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' is a near-perfect film. I'm a huge fan of the DC Animated Universe and my excitement leading up to the release of the adaptation of one of the best graphic novels of all time was evident. Warner Bros. better be careful because I'm not sure how much better they can get. While past DCU Animated films were hit-or-miss, the only hits and misses in this film come from the cringe-worthy and eye-popping moments delivered throughout.<br />This is, quite possibly, the most disturbing animated film you will ever see with the Batman name one it. Frank Miller's original graphic novel rebooted Batman for readers and generations to come and this film does indeed do it justice - especially when it comes to showcasing Miller's version of Joker - the most demented, beyond-twisted criminal on screen. Just how twisted Joker is are driven in with literal &#34;bangs&#34; and he gleefully hops around, fatally shooting whomever he sees. This is the Joker that - even on the page in a static image - would inspire every variation of the Joker to come. No longer the Ceasar Romero giggly version of the 60s, the Joker is twisted and demented. Without Frank Miller's Joker, we would not have Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger's Joker variations.<br />The inspiration given to Christopher Nolan for his Batman Trilogy is also evident within, as the aging Bruce Wayne struggles to deal with his own mortality as well as the mortality of the people he cares about.<br />As awesome as it is, the only weak point of the film is also my least favorite part of the graphic novel - everything slides a little bit once Superman enters the picture. While Miller's visuals are stunning, the story does slide from Batman to the god-like Kryptonian a little too much for my taste, yet the ending paints a picture of just how indestructible a mere man can be.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Batman, DCU, Frank Miller, or just the original graphic novel, I have to recommend these films. They are incredible and probably the best offering yet from the Animated DC Universe.ave to recommend these films. They are incredible and probably the best offering yet from the Animated DC Universe.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|This DVD was a great purchase for the library.  I can not keep it on the shelf, as soon as it comes back it goes right back out the door on another check out.
B0053O89KG|5.0|If you are a mystery fan that likes a little romance and humor with your mystery you can't do better than this series.  It is<br />perfectly cast, and not only is it a mystery show, but you feel personally attached to these characters as they also share<br />family life.  It is not a dry procedural.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|He approached the whole afterlife concept as a nonbeliever which is how most people tend to feel about the subject. As he begins to experience the afterlife's sights, sounds and feelings he makes us all believers. It was also interesting following the things happening with his family and his body's condition while he was on the other side. It was nice to experience it all from a medical and mystical veiwpoint.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|Installs onto a compatible motherboard with no problems. Computer runs just fine. Eight more words required for a good review?
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I watched Tron: Legacy because I saw the original Tron and was interested to see how well they did on the special effects of the new one. While the special effects were cool, the movie was quite bad. However, I loved the music, so I purchased the soundtrack. I really like listening to it as energetic background music.
044654759X|5.0|the book was very well priced AND was a hardback. two qualities of a book that usually come with the price to match it. i was very satisfied with the product and the shipping. it is also a great read, can't go wrong with this purchase.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|The talking Tom app does't work with the Kindle, but all the other little features do. I guess it is pretty good any ways
B000FC12SM|5.0|Very insightful! Silly Boys! Opens up a whole new world! I loved the Translation Dictionary! And the scenarios of how to react.
B003QSJVTY|1.0|My husband and I just wanted to rent an old movie. We paid the extra for HD, what a waste! I might as well have been watching a dirty VCR tape. Plus, it kept cutting out and buffering, something that never happens with Netflix or Hulu. Never ordering from Amazon again
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I did this show on instant movie and had it for two days and friends watched it like four times it is the coolest when you can watch again the next day to see what you missed......
B001GA1RFA|5.0|This book is a thoughtful look at teenagers who don't quite &#34;fit&#34; into the standard mold.  Two friends leave on a journey to discover something about the world and end up discovering something about themselves.  Excellent read.  Very well written.  My granddaughter (13) and I both loved the book.
B002UNMW7O|2.0|I was hoping  Boondock Saints II  All Saints Day  would of been as good as Boondock Saints 1  That is my personal opinion  as a rating  for in II  I become lost in the story  as I didn't in 1  Maybe that is why Boondock Saints 1 is a classic
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I purchased a similar device initially and after about a month of usage it stopped charging to full strength, it  would only charge to 50%, so I returned it and purchased the Anker. So far it works really well, I have not out the full charge yet and I have walked around carrying it with my phone when I was using my android phone extensively. I like the size , it is nice and compact and I keep the connectors I need which are switchable in the nice pouch it comes with. I use the micro usb connector for my android phone and the apple connector for my iPad.<br /><br />My Android phone battery is 2100 mA so in theory this charger should be able to charge it 3X . I have not confirmed this
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good movie!  I don't love intense/clinging to the edge of your seat action usually, but I had to see this after it won Best Picture and I was not disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Don't fall for those fakes, this is the real and best deal. The only one that isn't horrible is survivalcraft, but it's controls are messed up. Best $6.99 I've ever spent!!!!!
B0013DCC72|4.0|I liked it for the most part. There are couple of songs that I felt were a little &#34;pop musicish&#34;. I can't think of the name of these songs. Overall, I liked 80% of the album. I think I will look into earlier albums with Incubus. I like it loud and heavy.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|My 16 year old daughter said I HAD to see this movie. it was better than I expected, actually. Not bad.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I really can't believe that so many people thought this was funny!  I certainly don't object to raunchy humor, but I can't believe that they actually tried to make this into some sort of actual dramatic story.  Some funny parts, but not worth the rental.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I was so taken by the characters in this book. I couldn't put it down. Eleanor and Park feel authentic and they stuck with me long after I finished the book. The author has such a great voice for YA lit and I can't wait to read more from her.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 is better than season 2.  I love watching this series by the season, instead of by the episode.  I don't have to wait a week for the next.  I'm excited about season 4.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I do not usually read these types of books, but I have enjoyed this series do far. I recommend this series for anyone. Ready to read book 3 now!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I couldn't wait for this season to come out and it hasn't disappointed!  I just wish it was free on prime :-)
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Columbo is a perfect TV Show, I enjoyed it verry much. Lt<br />Colunbos strainge style of doing a homicide investigation!! I think if you love to watch TV, you have to see this one!!!
B005LAIHCM|2.0|I basically knew he was from the very beginning.  Not to much guessing when it came down it.  OK for people who do not the ending.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is very addicting!! Its very User friendly and encourages you to make new friends on Facebook, but you can also play without having a FB account.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I chose this book because I had heard it was a good depiction of what it was like to have Alzheimer and be a family living with it. This book was well written, pulled me in and stirred up many emotions. It made me more aware of the tiny everyday things families have to deal, the everyday and long term fears that ripple through coupled with and the love that gets rekindled/strengthened in so many ways.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Don't get me wrong, the sequel had a fine ending. Or it could have had one if it was well written. I was losing myself, and not in the way you would want to wen reading a book. I felt like there was no plot most of the time, and the number of &#34;aha!&#34; moments were very limited. Most of the story was bland and I felt myself having to just get to the next page to see of something can be explained for me. It rarely was.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|I  have never read a book by Jeffrey Archer that I didnt like. !!  He holds my interest from the first chapter until the end. What i  especially like is the endings in his books are never quite what i expect.So I am always looking for more. I was not disappointed in The Clifton Chronicles. He doesnt waste time on waffeling with words but gets on with the storyline and holds my interest right to the end. I always enjoy the Family Sagas and consider him to be a master of these.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book goes well beyond being another cutesy 'dog book'.  The insights into human behavior offered by the author with a wonderful sense of humor makes this a book a 'do not miss'.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|Read it for the second time.  Enjoy the intrigue though it always disturbs me that in the early books the opposition (Haven) is painted so negatively and Manticore so innocent.  Only later do we see a leveling occur.  And no ones technology always just stays so much better.  But all that being said, one of the best Sci-Fi series to come along in years.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I enjoyed the new story lines, it added some new twists and expanded the series for the next season. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes zombie literature/movies.
B009NXAMW6|5.0|The best twister I had seen.. Glue onto your seat, it's worth your movie going fling time. Buy, rent, or join to see this great Richard Gere Movie.....
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Unpredictable ending very strong story line all together a very nice read.<br /> I my self could not put it down.
B009EE1GC4|4.0|Movie was unique.  Enjoyed the plotline and the cast did a fabulous job of acting.  Especially enjoyed everyone's sense of humor.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|From what I remember of reading the book this movie followed it reasonably well. I feel like it would have been quite spectacular to watch in a 3D IMax type setting due to the visual effects. I did enjoy the experiences Pi went through and it was entertaining.
B0063IH60K|3.0|every single game starts with an ad, some of which you can&#34;t stop for a 10-20 seconds.  game is fine once you get to play it.
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|I don't hate it but I'm not gonna let my kids watch it. It had a lot of potential and I was looking forward to enjoying it but after watching it, I was disappointed. There were a few things I didn't like but I thought I could overlook, like, I didn't like Silverman's voice for the glitchy character, it didn't sound like a girl, it sounded like a grown woman sounding dumb. The zombie getting his heart ripped out was too graphic for my children, its a concept that they don't fathom or understand and the questions would be unnecessary. I didn't like their choice of song for when the girl first drove her car, &#34;shut up and drive&#34;; the lyrics have sexual innuendo and as if that's not bad enough to expose kids to, &#34;shut up and drive&#34; isn't something I want my kids singing along to or saying to me or anyone else, seeing how kids repeat everything they hear, I don't want to expose them to that and then have to correct them whenever they feel like repeating it. I was willing to try to overlook these unnecessary parts in the movie and just talk to my kids about them.... but then there were deal breakers: Near the end, the &#34;bad guy&#34; said something like &#34;it would be more fun to kill you&#34; and then he tells Ralph &#34;let's watch her die together&#34;.... SERIOUSLY??? WTH?!! Do I want my innocent children watching and hearing this garbage??? My kids who have no concept of death or killing or that such evil exist that someone could enjoy morbidly making someone watch who they care about die???!!! And this is supposed to be a Disney movie? For children, sweet innocent children? I think people who come out with things like this soil the name of Disney and its a shame. Big disappointment, it had so much potential.
B00BU8QOII|5.0|This was a unique movie.  Very intense.  Not one to watch before going to bed. :)  Made this whole true life disaster seem more real.  Made me realize all of the complications such a disaster brings with it.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Seen it before and it makes me laugh each time. Such good characters and story. Recommend this to anyone who is looking for some good clean fun and a family movie.
1932735410|5.0|Covers all the bases and then some.  It is all that everyone says it is and if you know it materials, you will have to pass the test
B00B99KJR0|3.0|Enjoyed up untill last screen can not get past it on Egept nothing will let me get past the last screen.
034580404X|4.0|I love the books, but the pages are thin and the box is crappy and can barely stand if the books aren't in it.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|This movie really put a great deal of power into the story of Jesus. As I followed along, there were several things that became more apparent to me as I watched that had not fully realized when reading the Bible. So incredible that one man would endure so much for us out of love.
B004OZZ624|5.0|I agree with one of the viewer, you really cant figure out the plot. It was made very well. You can't anticipate the next scene. I love it. Very recommendable.
B00BW5K5DO|3.0|They don't tell you it is temperialy free. You have to purchase it to play it. Then you can't get it off you tablet.
B004GXAZL6|5.0|What is it not to like about Baldacci's books? I've read a lot of them and I can honestly say he is one of the best writers of the kind. I just love it and I am so pleased that he wrote so many books :-)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Seems to be very good at sharpening even pitted knives. Haven't tried it too much but it's compact design and ease of use pretty much guarantee that it'll be used many times in the future.
B004X4RU9I|5.0|Great movie, full of action and good plot. The story is true to life. I like how Donnie Yen portrayed the IP man. Very recommendable movie. Plus the fact that it's free..Try it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Very chalenging and enjoyed so far. mmmmmm  mmmmmm mmmmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
B00908DDZM|5.0|I usually don't review music, and I also rarely listen to rap. I first heard of Macklemore from \\"Thrift Shop,\\" just like most people. I find that song highly over-played so I rarely listen to it when it's on the radio, but I fell in love with \\"Can't Hold Us\\" when I heard that for the first time. I came on Amazon to look at his other music, and I was amazed at the super high reviews for this album. I gave it a listen on Spotify, and I was actually pretty blown away. For someone who doesn't care for rap, I actually REALLY like this album. Like other reviewers mention, there is so much meaning behind the lyrics. Macklemore is an incredible writer and it's so hard to do anything else while the album is playing, because all you want to do is listen to the words- they are so engaging. Take a song like \\"Same Love\\"...I almost cried the first time I listened to that because the message is so amazing. I haven't bought a CD/mp3 album in awhile thanks to Spotify, Pandora, and iHeartRadio...but I am actually going to buy this one because it's something I would prefer to own and put on my iPod, listen in my car, and my old stereo. It's that good.
0307719774|5.0|I took a chance on this because I am very bad at keeping a journal but have had the desire to keep one for a while now. This is the perfect book for me. It only asks for a couple of lines a day which is easy to do right before bed and I actually enjoy thinking back to find the best or most interesting things that happened to write down. But in the case of last night when I had nothing exciting to report there is a convenient question at the top of each page that I could answer and call it good. For example, the question was if I could interview any celebrity, who would it be? (for information's sake I answered Emma Watson, of course). Fantastic book, great quality, does not feel or look cheap in any way. VERY happy with my purchase.
B001AQO446|5.0|Hey, this movie is just plain fun & one u can watch over & over & laugh every single time..
B008YRVW0I|2.0|They don't tell you it is only free for a short time of play then you have to purchase if you want.  But you then can't get it off your table.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The movie fills in a lot of gaps. The characters are more fully drawn than in earlier episodes. All of the neat neo-Victorian England visual is here.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Anything by Led Zeppelin is just fantastic. Jimmy Page was spot on and Robert Plant sounded good.<br />Would recommend this to any Zeppelin fan!
B004SIP6A4|5.0|so glad 2 see musicals moving into a 21 century format -not your mama's musical! Who knew Richard Gere can sing & dance
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best book ever written and the audio is very good. would recommend to others to get and learn from as much as possiable
B003TWONOK|4.0|Would certainly recommend to a friend - Nora Roberts always has that little twist at the end to keep you guessing
