B00U5OKH22|5|Awesome Awesome AWESOMEEE! seriously, Gracie (my car :) looks great!
B005HBF4RG|5|Looks great on my bike and has just the right amount of space to be useful.
B005ESHUGK|1|ITS HUGE!
B00JE2MTYA|4|Purchased for my son's helmet. He likes it.
B009YEYN6A|4|Just great!  Thanks
B0051MYLS4|3|Good length for my Porsche wheel but too thick to go through the space in between break protect plate. I had to cut sponge and stitching the cloth. Further improvement will make product better..
B0043BUHG4|1|Not worth $20 when you only really get to use 2/3 of the tube. Not to mention, if you put the nozzle on and just try to use it, you've wasted your money. The tube needs to be cleared before putting the nozzle on, thereby wasting even more before even getting to use it. I've used 2 part epoxy type tubes like this before and have never had the nozzle clog before anything comes out. I tried just using it without the nozzle, but since the product doesn't fully mix that way, it ended up just making a complete mess of my sidewalk. I wouldn't mind if this wasn't so expensive. $20 completed wasted.
B00PHUGQFQ|5|Love this jacket, comfortable, breathable. stylish. I am 6 foot 7 and it fits my sleeve length fine. Lots of complements too from fellow riders.
B00TFZFU56|1|peeled off backing and lost the lettering...didnt even get to use the sticker!
B0101U6OVW|5|Just the right size, looks good.
B00EZLP3MK|4|My husband likes it.
B00HAWI5EY|5|Perfect fit and easy to install!
B001IUV1CM|5|Awesome
B006Z907TY|5|Great addition to my carry on.  Fits all airlines I've ever been on except Delta International Business Class.
B009S2V4MY|5|grate part, recommend it to use
B000CB6D0S|5|Works great!
B00FBQKLA2|1|I bought 2 Ball Joint RENAULT Kang. Bellow damage, has no screws. I did not put these auto parts on his car.
B00O9AXM98|5|really pretty
B003CJHPHW|5|These bandannas are very nice.  They are much prettier than what you would find at the your average, brick and mortar retailer.
B0001EFSTI|5|Very handy, sharp blade and great tool
B00TBHXC4E|5|Formula 303 products are the best, this stuff keeps the plastic rear window on my 1996 convertible in good condition.
B00EQMI62W|5|These brakes work great and fit perfect!
B000C5SGA4|2|Connector does not fit 1999 Toyota Sienna, although Amazon said it would fit.  I have to cut the old connector and splice the wire.  That made it working. However, if rain or engine washing, the spliced wire could allow water damage to those exposed wires in it. I am not very thrilled about that.
B003AT4RHK|5|Easy to install. works great. Installed on a 1999 Volvo V70.
B00BD62X9Q|5|Replaced an older version of this which had stopped working.  This worked great and is perfect for the 07 Rav4.
B003UVCY00|5|works great, very bright light
B003E5P7EW|5|I ordered this muffler for my husbands camaro, he loves it! Sounds so much better then just a boring v6 now. (: Item delivered on time, was as described, and had great customer service.
B0047D9TS0|5|They are great, only I returned them as it turned out the stock ones on the Cadillac were just fine after all, just a hose repair and now they work great.........
B00NC53BJW|1|It was smaller than the original manufacture boot
B000P4WEPU|5|Get here on time, fit in to my 2008 galant good.
B000A7BMKK|5|Good quality and sturdy be sure to sand sharp edges when you get it though
B00J8W5Z9C|5|Very cool and no signal loss!
B00CGFPW64|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B003TBUICM|1|Cheap plastic, broke first day using it. Comes with two clips, didn't bother to use the second one because first one was so useless.
B0056B5IB4|5|Sizes are dead on!  I'm a size 4 jean 5'7&#34; 135lbs I ordered the XS and its fits perfectly.  The leather is VERY nice quality not stiff at all.  I highly recommend these.......and as always.....safe riding!
B00DPJ3RDA|5|Works as advertised!
B00KTIQQK6|5|Excellent.  Good prices and fast shipping. Awsome fixed my old ones really nice.
B003VAWMFC|5|Just what we needed to cut the sun down. Easy to install, good looking. Gives you some privacy but you can see out just fine. Nice quality product.
B00O9H1JCS|5|I had 2 of these installed earlier at SAMs Club along with 2 new tires. They work great right out of the wrapper! No tool needed to program. Only had to do the relearn process and they work like a charm!
B000IYC96G|5|Best gate supports ever!  I lift my gate a total of 4 inches and step back as it rises on it's own. I've tried several other brands and had issues with my liftgate dropping after 2-3 months of use and always having to lift the gate fully, with the supports holding only at the top.  Just got one of these for the hood so I don't have to play with the prop rod too.
B003SODY8A|5|Very heavy and made better than my OEM. Perfect fit for my 99 Escalade!
B003NBFMMY|5|Great price and great product.
B0002Q7BYU|5|Worked great on my 94 s-10 pickup, comes with everything you need, I've had it for a few years now and it still works fine, good product.
B002I2IMQW|5|Great price! Great quality! Excellent purchase!
B000UIURN2|5|exelente
B0009I5WS8|5|Its what I needed works well
B00YIHH3ZQ|5|Yes it is excellent and sent in a timely manner, thank you! Demon Decal is the best!
B003VY1P4W|3|Decent for the Price. Not too comfy
B003XWEO7C|5|nice price looks great on my 76 harley
B00IMUC9YA|5|This fits my VW Beetle perfectly.  It is easy on my hands and looks good.
B0002UEMZ2|5|Great stuff, but remember to knead it real good and let it set up at least overnight when used in high vibration situations.
B010C6URQI|5|I love this unit, it travels well. Kools my soda.
B004BQ87YK|5|I used this paint on 4 sets of calipers over the past 14 years and can tell you that it is very durable will not chip under most conditions.  The only time it chipped was after a mechanic chipped a caliper when putting on one of my wheels.  The paint holds it's color and is very durable.<br /><br />If you can remove a tire, you can paint your calipers.  I don't have a lift so the way I've applied it in the past is to remove each wheel one at a time and prep (clean and tape) each caliper.  After that, I go around the car removing each wheel to put a coat of the paint on and then putting the wheel back on the car and moving to the next wheel.  For the last coat, I remove the tape so that I can paint over any areas that were a bit over-taped and show any areas on the caliper that need to be painted.  It is a bit time-consuming but it works fine.<br /><br />The paint itself hardens after a few hours so you have to apply it in one setting.  I've applied it on cool days and on hot days.  It will not harden nearly as fast if it is cool out so you should do it when it isn't very hot out.  The kit comes with enough paint to do at least 3-4 coats per caliper.  The last time I used it, I spilled much of the paint (UGH) after only putting on 1 coat per caliper.  I continued applying it and had just enough for 3 coats.  This was on a 2016 Mazda CX-7 with what I assume are average sized brakes.<br /><br />The paint can be cleaned up with mineral spirits but you have to do it pretty promptly before it hardens.<br /><br />The kit comes with a brush that is usable but does not allow precise painting, so consider buying a smaller brush for hard to reach areas.<br /><br />The paint hardens into a very hard surface that is much harder than an ordinary paint.  I have never detected any fading.  It is great stuff and it lasts.
B00M47OOOK|5|They are very good compressors and they got to my home on time
B0095TC604|5|Exactly as advertised. No vibration even with the somewhat flexible mirror covers on my Honda Ridgeline. The carry bag is worthless unless you want to go through the process of getting them properly set up every time, but I don't think that's worth a penalty given how good everything else is. Amazon price was $60 less than at RV dealer.
B005PCCZLA|2|The frame is a touch smaller than it needs to be.  the plate frame that came with the car fit my new plate easily, I had to shave down all sides plate to make it fit.  Even then it does not look great.  ended up putting the dealer frame back on ill I can find a better unit.
B00AWI7II2|5|Sunshade makes a good product. When we buy a new car the first accessory we purchase is one of these. They're well made and don't fall apart. My five year old shade looks brand new.  Giant upgrade over a cheap piece of foil covered cardboard.  Made in American too, that's important.
B00K3OS2A8|5|All Triumph Motorcycles should come with this fuel cap. I wish I didn't have to buy this separately. Adds looks and protection.
B003PERH9K|2|Item was advertised as &#34;bumper sticker&#34;, so I presumed it was one piece. It arrived in 3 separate pieces. I will have a hard time getting it straight/even, so I won't be using it as planned.
B00S0F1UQA|1|Dealer says it is not programmable, what a waste.  When I bought it, it said it would fit my 2011 CTS and now I look it up again and there is an alert that it won't work, thanks!
B004J0RH80|1|DOA...broken frame.
B000M5Y720|4|Better than the base sylvania's my rav4 came with. I wouldn't say it was a huge difference, but definitely noticeable and just worth the 25 bucks.  I went from stock, to zXe's, which lasted about 2 years, and now I just put these on yesterday. So we will see how long they last.  Compared to the zXe's, these are pretty close. These ultras aren't quite as white, but brightness is too close to justify buying the zXe's at 2x the cost.
B0049DWJA8|5|This solenoid is an exact fit on my 2002 infinity. I've had it installed for a few months now without a problem.
B0012I8LYQ|5|Very nice filter cover.
B005XEBIC2|2|DIDN'T LAST LONG
B00IWT5VVE|5|Excellent fit. Great finish. Speedy delivery.
B008DNIJ90|5|Solid and metal. Very nice and perfect fit.
B002R1ELIW|5|works great
B0042Z0XWY|3|Very nice!!
B000C9H8RM|1|Did not fit my 2002 Denali
B000BW8NLA|5|This rotor I compared with the OEM part that I took off my Dodge was just as well constructed as the original. I replaced distributor cap at the same time. Everything smoothed out. No more misses during idle or acceleration. I would buy this part again if needed.
B00GWFEEBI|1|HORRIBLE PRODUCT !!! It does not fit a cbr 1000rr 07 just like stated on the compatibility chart, gass cap doesn't sit flush with tank , locking system on the ignition does not work horrible horrible horrible
B005BNZFQ0|5|Excellent product
B00LPRNMZM|5|Very nice.
B006WZOVHA|1|I have 4 different brands of meters, ranging from harbor freight junk, to fieldmaster, to fluke...these leads didn't fit any of them!  Make sure they fit your meter before buying!
B00WQBU2RC|4|I wish the people who write the Amazon.com product descriptions would screw their heads on straight and think about how people are going to use the product.  In this case the purpose is obvious.  However, the environment where the product is used is cramped, and the dimensions are of interest.  This product's description gives no clue to the actual product size; the dimensions given are those of the product carton.<br /><br />The actual container is cylindrical, with a diameter of 2-3/4&#34;.  It fits quite nicely in the door compartment of my Ford Escape.  Of course, the absolutely crucial dimension is the size of the mouth.  The inside diameter is 1-3/8&#34;.  What about capacity?  Molded in the side of the container are volume measures.  The largest is marked 600 mL. which is just below the finger indentations in the hemispherical end of the cylinder.<br /><br />Other than a real long number (serial number?), the other markings are Chinese characters.  My guess is that's it's an advisory message: &#34;Don't use while driving.&#34;
B005G21JP2|1|Replaced motor because of a failed motor. Within 2 months the gearbox attached to this motor striped out and no longer works
B001B5GA0C|1|I am really disapointed with the purchase. I requested a clutch suitable for an Acura TSX 2004. Your website indicated that this one fit all base Acura TSX 2004 models. However the discs were much too small. I had to order another one that will arrive tomorrow. This delay has been a huge inconvenience as well as a costly error because I need the car to get to work.<br />I would like to return it for a refund as soon as possible.<br /><br />Alexander Ghanotakis
B004J6H5QS|4|Very small pads compared to prior on car butseem work  fine
B0107UG5O2|5|This LED gives very bright white light; it is a huge improvement over the factory incandescent bulb.  The heatsink on the back should help with its longevity.  I am very pleased with this bulb so far.  For those who may think that the slimness of the unit may mean not much light, as I had initially thought, that's not the case at all.  It's very bright.  I highly recommend it.
B004GSL9XO|4|Fit well, good quality
B00BUHW5PK|5|works fine
B000GBBP8O|5|This product worked perfectly for my Audi 2001 A6 Quatro.  Well packaged, fast delivery, solid construction.
B00X2TUW1I|5|These shades are GREAT! Extremely easy to apply (I had previously tried the Brica brand, and they were flimsy, super hard to use and were in the trash shortly after I purchased them). Now we just have to keep our son from ripping them off the windows. Thank you!!
B003CGDNYE|5|Very nicely polished, which not only looks good but is key to keeping your synthetic winch line in good shape.  The included hardware is good quality and looks great.
B001DRHMPK|5|I love Mann products.  I switched from a Mobil 1 to Mann in my Audi A4.  It's a great product
B007TY6A72|1|I wasn't the right one that I needed.  I don't know but I think I'm stuck with it
B00UW4DLJ6|5|Worked as advertised. Very easy to operate. It jumped my battery immediately and was able to do so a second time two days later without having to be re-charged. I purchased two more for use in my family's other two vehicles.
B00HRY7W7Q|5|Works fine, installed it
B000CO8XXU|5|I am using these in my 1966 mustang which has brakes from a 2007 Mustang GT. They are a serious upgrade in bite from the OEM compound and they were easy to bed in. I have run these pads on several different vehicles and every time they are a great upgrade.
B00JQ5RX3M|1|Crap. Don't waste your money... Really, really cheap Chinese junk. Doesn't look at all like the pictures. Threading on the screw on cap stripped after two uses.
B00I0RGPNQ|5|Good
B00AE4U6T2|5|I purchased this for the future as I advance in years.  Well, the future came, and this key finder is the best.  I couldn't find my car keys, went to the remote, and with a little moving around and listening, found them.  I decided I'd put the receiver on the house key as well the mail box (always seem to misplacing both of them), and when I can't find them, I go into panic mode.  NO MORE -- THANKS TO THE WTR KEYFINDER.
B00480J4JG|5|Simple replace in my MKV GTI. Whole process took about 10 minutes. The most difficult thing is getting the stupid plastic ring back in place. Part seems to be completely OEM and beats the hell out of the dealerships insane quote of $200 a headlight! So far so good, and I am glad to find a place where I can get these little guys at a great price.
B000CNGO0K|5|Worked great
B003CRHZ0Q|3|Bumper arrived on time and looked ok aside from the huge dent on one side that caused the plastic pad to buckle. Also, the paint finish was rough on one corner. Price was great but not cheap enough to excuse the careless packaging and inferior paint. Also, if your truck has a Reese hitch installed it utilizes two bolt holes on the bottom of the bumper and thank goodness I had access to a tap set because good luck installing the bolts in these holes without first taking the time to remove all bolts on the bottom side to realign all holes and tap the bolt holes. I managed to beat the dent out but the bumper is still warped and the bolt holes underneath are questionable.
B00W1GXLZC|5|I used these on a xs850, they look great on the bike and function as well as the stock levers.
B00CCWMAAM|5|Great bumper!!
B00RHQBNMY|3|Containers are very sturdy but the tissue's are not soft enough.
B00S5ZXC7A|3|Worked fine after buying app for it.
B009HL9KG8|4|3 Years, installed on 2 cars, gone through the Boston snow Storm in 2015 and Ohio snow storm in 2013, and this Philips DRL is still as bright as the time when I first received it in June 2013.<br /><br />The reason that I took one star off is because if you stand at the side of of your car, and the brightness of the DRL looks dimmer, and you can also see tiny black spots in the DRL (some Audi DRL has the same issue) (in contrast to Porsche LED DRL, same style, but the OEM looks nicer from every angle on Porsche).
B00GBBC8FW|4|A little plain but serves its purpose.
B003FHLNVK|4|Helps wind noise a surprising amount. I will buy again for every helmet I get in the future.
B001EQLE2C|5|What is the best intake solution for the twin turbo N54?  Well, many would argue the point, and it's a learning curve, for sure, trying to answer that question, since opinions range from saying the stock airbox is the best you'll ever do, to claims that a drop in filter beats out any DCI (dual cone intake) set-up, to views that, to some, only a DCI is the way to go, while, to others, it is a total waste of cash.<br /><br />While I agree that no DCI is a magic bullet for instantly huge gains, I'm also of the school that &#34;every ounce counts&#34; when it comes to horsepower, and I'm always amazed by those who don't get that, and thus will spend a bunch on a meth kit, for example, but ignore something as basic as having a full catback exhaust, or replacing weak stock diverter valves prone to boost leak.  So, true enough, no intake system is like swapping in a V10, but improving the intake system over stock is rarely, if ever, a waste of time or money.  Gains WILL be had.<br /><br />Learning the N54 from scratch, a lot had to be researched and answered, before even debating which intake to choose, but the same method applied as on any other build, which is more flow in, more flow out, and better management in between.  So that meant full catback (went with aFe for that, as well, and VERY HAPPY with their Mach Power exhaust), upgraded FMIC, upgraded diverter valves, new charge pipe, and then an intake solution, of course, along with the &#34;better management in between&#34; bit being solved by COBB's masterful AccessPort -- probably the best &#34;instant tune&#34; device ever created, and an AMAZING product worth every penny of the asking price.<br /><br />Starting early on with just a high flow drop in filter did yield gains, but then with Cobb tuning next, more was needed.  Despite getting no answers from COBB on any recommendation, enough other owners spoke highly enough of this DCI set up here from aFe, that it definitely seemed worth it.  I have seen just the &#34;cones&#34; stuck on the end of the intake inlets (and used that for about a week actually), and that just doesn't look so great, plus it got in the way of the aftermarket diverter valves.  Overall then, this kit from aFe seemed a really well thought out solution.<br /><br />It's really terrific when form and function can go together, and aFe has definitely done their homework here.  Removal of the stock airbox, and use of the stock rubber grommets from the stock airbox results in this set up fitting securely beneath the hood, no rattles, no clearance issues, and, because of how they have set up the piping into the intake tubes, there are no issues with an aftermarket charge pipe, or diverter valves.  So, a beautiful kit that looks great and fits snug -- as solid as the stock set up in terms of fitment.<br /><br />Performance wise, well, it's hard to gauge just one part of any build, since parts working in harmony is what brings gains, but suffice to say the Cobb Stage 2 Sport tune is very happy and the gains over stock are obviously night and day, but, as I say, it's impossible to parcel out just the role of the aFe intake system, without un-installation, dyno testing and re-installation, which is more the realm of any &#34;proof&#34; aFe would want to provide, or someone wanting to really isolate just the gains of this one mod.<br /><br />Most would not really need that information, since most of the time this is not the only mod anyone is doing, but then again there is always the question, even as part of a modding package, to ask what intake option gives the &#34;most&#34; gains among all options available.  To answer that, looking at what's out there for the N54, there's a drop in high flow filter (in the stock airbox), higher flow filters just added to the intake inlets themselves (or variants thereof) and then this setup, from aFe.  It might be splitting hairs to say which has more horsepower potential to offer, but, set up wise, this one from aFe rules.<br/><br />Clearly, any and all of those just mentioned will provide improved flow of some degree, but, from what I have seen available for the N54, this is the ONLY set up that comes as a fully integrated kit, making use of the main stock air flow diversion set up (which is retained after removing the stock airbox), diverting that flow toward these cones, keeping the cones up and out of the way of things, providing a degree of shielding with the intake &#34;box&#34; that is provided (in which the filters sit, as shown in the product photo) and accomplishing all of that with a great look.  Plus, for those modifying their diverter valves, this is the only set up I could find that has sweep down piping to allow more room for something more bulky in DV replacement, like the excellent DV's provided by Forge, which don't work with either the stock airbox or just cones under the hood.<br /><br />So, in some ways this is not just the best, but, the only option that does the job, depending on what mods you are doing.<br /><br />While power gains, as I say, can't be isolated except to say these this system works GREAT as part of a modding packing or modding path, the sound gains from this kit can be addressed on its own merits, and in that respect this DCI kit from aFe is definitely superior to either the drop in filter, or just the cones.  Having had all three, this set up is the clear winner in an aggressive yet &#34;interior cabin friendly&#34; sound gain.<br /><br />At high rpm there is actually an outright demonic whine which causes those defeated (as you fly by them) to claim you're hiding an added supercharger in there somewhere, but I think that is actually due to the Forge DV's, although perhaps in concert with this intake system -- certainly it contributes to some degree and the resultant rage of aggressive noise is impressive beyond measure.  As for hearing the turbos more, well, again the upgraded DV's accomplish that -- providing a subtle but very pleasing near-to-BOV sound &#34;whoosh&#34; which is very noticeable especially if DSC is fully off -- so it's hard to say what role the DCI kit here might play, but it certainly opens things up more, so you'll hear everything more, of whatever you've got going on under the hood in your particular build/mods situation.<br /><br />Bottom line, there are cheaper intake solutions that may gain about as much as this kit, or near to it, and it's not uncommon for various companies to make claims that might seem difficult to pin down so, dollar for horsepower, this may seem overpriced, considering you can stick some cones under there, or drop in a higher flow filter, for well under a hundred bucks.  If that does it for you, then you'll likely consider it money well spent, especially if funds are limited and other parts have a higher priority.  Understandable.  After all, just because one can own a used Bimmer doesn't mean there are piles of cash laying around to throw at higher priced parts -- and this system is not cheap, compared to other options, given that its near to four hundred bucks.  Then again, this is an investment worth making.<br /><br />So, yes, cheaper is cheaper, but better is better, and, if you can spring for this kit, you'll be glad you did.  The build quality is outstanding, from the overall design and build of the box, to terrific details like vibration-canceling trim pieces and a complimentary kit for cleaning and oiling the provided filters.  They even include a full sheet of decals for you to let the world know you love your aFe products, if you're of a mind to do so.  The performance, while not necessarily &#34;proven' to be superior to other options, is augmented by an amazing fit and finish, so even if it only does as well as other kits, or even only slightly better, it looks far better doing it, which puts it at the top of the heap just in that regard.  And, based on the build and design of it, even though I'm no engineer or physicist, it certainly looks like it would outshine other, lesser, setups, in terms of the gains -- in other words, given how much thought went into it, and how well it is put together, I would tend to believe aFe's claims.<br /><br />My summary then is that, for the N54, particularly in concert with other modifications, this easily stands out as being at the top of the list, if not being the number one option, for an upgraded intake system.  While it may seem a pricey modification over other intakes, I think the price is more than justified for what aFe provides here.  Perfect fitment, solid performance and even looks great under the hood.  To me, that's money very well spent, and aFe has certainly made a believer out of me.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!-BOV sound &#34;whoosh&#34; which is very noticeable especially if DSC is fully off -- so it's hard to say what role the DCI kit here might play, but it certainly opens things up more, so you'll hear everything more, of whatever you've got going on under the hood in your particular build/mods situation.<br /><br />Bottom line, there are cheaper intake solutions that may gain about as much as this kit, or near to it, and it's not uncommon for various companies to make claims that might seem difficult to pin down so, dollar for horsepower, this may seem overpriced, considering you can stick some cones under there, or drop in a higher flow filter, for well under a hundred bucks.

B00027GXR0|3|Almost everything worked, except for the points. The provided set were of a different style than those that are in the distributor. I double-checked all of the cross references and could find an issue. Rather that return the set, I just decided to reuse the old points for now.

B0022ZI0JY|5|This plastic scrapper and blades performed exactly as advertised.  Over the course of two hours I used this to remove stickers that had been superglued to my laptop.  The blades were durable enough that I was able to get under the aluminum stickers and pry them off.  Then with simple cleaning solution and patience I was able to slowly scrap away the gummy residue and dried super glue from the aluminum surface.  I was able to remove 99% of the super glue from the anodized aluminum without leaving a scratch.  I did go through almost the entire supply of plastic razors to accomplish this.
B0018GVUHC|5|Great sound out of this one . my f150 never sounded better
B00B0C0XWW|1|Does not fit to 2006 Honda Civic coupe . The rotor discs are large diameter than the original
B00UCTY6UY|5|Great product
B005FKR12K|1|Wrong parts for 96 4Runner....won't fit.
B000IYHCUE|5|Great price and works fine.
B00GRHSU5C|5|my kids are no longer getting burned from the sun!  Great item
B00BJP9BE6|5|Thank you
B004HOPL1S|5|Fits perfectly and functions well. TIP: Before replacing this, make sure you're fuse is not broken. You may not this in 1st place.
B00BCRMC1U|3|the covers does not fit my car as it stated that it would.
B000ZN4NVY|5|This was a perfect fit for what I needed to put on my car.  This was exactly what I needed for my car and this was perfectly priced.
B00HEERYSG|5|Worked great and was easy to locate and replace. Went in like a snap.
B003UTH088|5|Worked like a charm.
B002P3U6WM|5|Love it perfect match with my steering wheel cover
B006YBDHZE|5|Great purchase for my car.  It has saved cars flooring twice now from spills and it is invaluable use on winter months.
B003CJQZR8|3|Not bad shades, but they do not get very dark.
B00O25T3P2|5|Excellent Product
B0000AY69V|4|Cleans up spills no problem.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Love this - great product and fits my Q7 perfectly :)
B001BAF5YY|5|Product is as described.. Will buy again
B00N52TZZG|5|👍
B011FHZKVK|2|Took a month to arrive and was not as shown in pictures, the space in the middle of the letter &#34;A&#34; is filled in with the same base material, which looks cheap, although the picture shows that the open space in the letter &#34;A&#34; is all the way through.  Just wished I knew this before I ordered, I simply ask to show the ACTUAL ITEM  you are selling not modified versions.
B0017R5EQK|5|GOOD PRODUCT, NO HASSLE, I RECOMMEND.
B0052EPBX0|3|The item looks ok, but I dont like that it's made in china. If I knew that it was, I wouldnt buy it!
B007TG7HHC|5|Huge fan of these.  They work much better than other brands
B0050SFZBG|5|great for hard to reach hoses,perfect angle. this had to designed by a mechanic
B001EP0GMW|5|Fit perfect on 09 dodge caravan SE.  No need to trim bumper.  My bolts were rusted in and took days of soaking in wd-40 to remove.  Installation can be done by one person but I recommend getting a helper to hold it up while you start the bolts.
B00NO0JGPS|5|What about more but you ran out off stock
B005DMZN02|4|It works.
B00603DSGO|4|Excellent quality, nicely finished.  Doesn't have any bare metal so will not properly ground an antenna unless it's a &#34;no ground plane&#34; antenna.  Needs a bit of modification for a proper radio install.  Also, may not accommodate an oversized tire.  I have 33's with a vertical support bracket.  Had to cut a notch out of the top of the bracket to clear my support bracket for the larger tire.
B00MC6H0AI|5|I used these bulbs for my reverse lights in my 2002 Dodge Ram 2500. They fit inside the housing fine with plenty of clearance. Good replacement  bulb over the stock incandescent lights. They stock bulbs give off a yellowish color and these are a bright white color.
B006X98A7C|5|works good
B001HAV61Y|5|Great product I got it, filled it up and went to use it and was like what the hell it's not working...it has air....what the heck, must of been playing stupid, the red ring on the adapter is the open valve 😂
B004AXESTM|5|These are EXACTLY like my original lights...Finally!
B0083KIWHW|5|Looks good
B00RSOLXFM|5|Seems to have fixed the pizza smell in my car.
B002XM5G70|4|The pump works great and is a good replacement for the 2088.  As someone stated, I would not call the demensions exactly as the 2088.  Because of the pump head being larger than the 2088, it is about one inch taller in height.  If both inlet and outlet are flexible lines, that is fine.  My inlet was flexible and worked withouot changes.  My outlet was stiff plastic.  I used the fittings included, bought a peice of drinking water safe hose at hardware store and clamped it to the fittings.  I made a loop in it and it worked great.  If you had rather you can buy their silencing hose which does the same thing that mine did. Perhaps I missed the point of the height before I bought.  I would buy again.
B00WQ3A5HW|1|This decal was extremely delicate. Once pealed it warps. If you are wanting to have it on your vehicle perfectly this isn't the right decal for you. If you try and remove to correct the decal it further warps. All other decals I purchased were place and peel. This one is a normal sticker where you peel it off then place leaving room for bubbles and uneven placement.
B0068FTYOE|5|Great company and parts
B00EB7SB86|4|I gave it a 4star because i had a little issue connections of the 3 pin connector but eventually got it to work fine. Now my only issue with this taillight is that its not as clean as a fitment as the stock oem one is. As you can see in the pic, there's a little gap between the taillight and fairing. Other than that, it works great.
B009KBUPAU|3|Xentec Hid is sucks both the lighs only works couple a days and stop working ballast burn out
B00PD97AQA|5|Worked perfectly for my fog lights. Going to look for this vendor/product line in the future for other similar projects.
B001FM8IFQ|5|Great OEM replacement disk.  no frills, but no frills needed.  it fit fine, and was nice and quiet.
B00V2VF5GU|5|Fantastic
B00480J4KA|4|product is as described
B00DYXA3LQ|5|Great quality.
B0027AEUOS|4|Good product the holes on the pads did not match for my 64 impala but I made it happen by making one hole
B0000AXPDU|3|It appears to be good quality and the design is easy to use; however, it does not fit correctly on my 16&#34; Jeep Liberty wheels, so I can not use. Once installed, there is not enough clearance around the outside perimeter to properly seat the cap, therefore I can not lock :(
B012JVWKUK|5|Good quality sticker! Matte finish, smooth to touch! I would buy it again!
B000C9SR90|5|Genuine GM part, perfect fit, what more can I say?
B000C2GGAY|5|Worked fine.  Arrived packaged well.  Installed easily.  I installed it two weeks ago and it isn't leaking.
B009HSP3K8|4|Installing devise  very easy but directions make pulling panels off and reinstalling look easy when their not .Reinstalling panels can be tricky and frustrating for someone who does n,t do this all the time.
B00431O9BI|5|Love it!! Fast Shipping too!!
B00FSCJW0O|5|great
B002MRDKEW|5|Fits great works great
B011DKSCHI|5|good quality, just place, rub, peel, and its transfered
B00CXY32QA|4|The product is great but no instructions included  so i give it four stars
B003BKUAVU|5|Arrived on time, packaged very well.  Easy wiring, took just minutes to set up.  All the led's work as advertised.
B00863N3Z2|5|Very nice high quality piece. Will work out perfect for my intended use, which is to install it in a fifth wheel basement panel that will allow me to access my hot water heater bypass without having to remove a ginormous panel every time.
B000BOC2E2|5|It's tire slime, what can I sat. Price was excellent. $4.00 cheaper than Advance, and didn't have to drive to get it
B009TB0VLY|5|The sound is great! Can tell a world of a difference on sound and power. Very little restriction in muffler. Sounds like a totally different four wheeler. When putting muffler on, put a generous amount of lube onto the head head pipe where the muffler slips on this will make life alot easier. May also have to use a rubber mallet being carefull not to dammage muffler.
B002E2SJA0|5|Typical high quality HELLA part.
B00498GFEE|5|Very high quality but slow delivery !
B00KCXMCTM|3|This kit is platic product, not so good for the job that musta be performed.<br />Metal made kit would to better.
B004BFW0EO|5|Worked perfect better then expected. I had some really bad water spots on my car that were hard to remove. This product is awsome, all i did was apply a little of the 3d eraser on a microfiber towel wiped on the car within 5 seconds with little effort the spot just came off with ease.
B00PYZVZFA|1|useless
B00JSAQ0HK|5|Was just what I was looking for...
B00EAJOFHG|5|WORKS GREAT
B00NLMSDOE|4|I bought this for my boyfriend and he was very excited! He says it's very easy to use, but he'll have to makeshift a hole for the antenna. Otherwise it works as intended.
B0105HG8YE|5|Lights were easy to instal. Not all theights shipped worked with my car. But the lights I wanted to change worked! Love it!
B00HPRNSZK|5|great quality for the price.loved it.
B00EC0Y8Y8|1|This item did not install. Specifically, it did not snap in at the top. I am a low voltage contractor and work with my hands every day. The old one will go back in.<br />It got damaged trying to put it in so I can't return it. I will not buy again from Amazon
B00635HNC4|5|Every diabetic needs one
B004BTBUVE|5|really nice product, great price point
B0047CIN42|4|It works.
B000GRS2G6|1|Cheap & too small.
B001445IZ8|4|Used it on a 1970 VW...seems to suck all the oil out very fast.
B00KI3Q25G|5|Very good quality product
B00ONGRTN8|5|nice stuff
B00GYI1ICQ|5|mount fits perfect wiring was simple gave great directions

B0057B5O8U|5|Easy to install - works great!
B000WJA5F4|5|Works like a dream and gives more possibilities for mounting.  Love it.
B00VF7HZF0|5|Us to have for motorcyclesale adds a regular car charger & usb power supply.
B008HIUMOG|5|Very good
B00FW0SKS2|5|Worked perfectly on my 98 camaro
B0027QWNI2|5|Doesn't hold a lot, but holds what I need it to. Barely squeezed it onto my pickup truck visor, but managed. No complaints.
B000MK77RM|4|Perfect for my Chest & Cabinet Tool Box Drawers OK
B0076I2LGU|5|good quality replacement
B00DF6MSQA|5|Nice quality, perfect accent for my CUV

B0052FRT2A|5|excellent
B0009H51U8|5|good price
B00R8GO0WS|5|Looks pretty good
B00D7LTNW0|5|Awesome waterless car wash! One of the best
B00EAQ2H5Q|3|Great idea but they need to do something about the audio output.... sounds like a antique radio at best..
B004BE621C|5|SIMPLE PLUG-IN .WORKS ON MY UTILITY,CAR & BOAT TRAILER . HEAVY DUTY CONSTRUCTION
B009OXCE3U|5|Perfect!
B0000BYASB|5|You can lift a pwc off trailer to put on a cart to work on it or store it inside, This and surfix teflon bunk slides are a must if you need to move ski's around alot.
B007G6LWCQ|4|Would have liked a lite larger lettering but<br />Love it
B0091I1Q4Q|2|Doesn't work very well.  I keep it on the dash of my vehicle in the AZ sun, and i'll come back to a dead battery.  Maybe it will work better for something else.
B00514C1GG|5|Directions were a bit light on installation but overall great product!
B00E65BEQE|5|good product just as seen
B001F02NCW|5|perfect
B008BTLB1O|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Sea-Doo GSI. Battery was fully charged when I received. Just connected the battery and the Sea-Doo started right up. Previous big-box retailer battery wasn't sealed and was a maintenance nightmare. Sealed is the only way to go. I understand these batteries don't last forever, but I am hopeful I will get a couple/three seasons out of this battery with maintenance charging during the winter months. So far so good with no indication the battery is loosing its charge in between rides. Well built battery that is a high performer.
B001RNOHBC|4|I use this regularly to power a small clip-on fan when doing paperwork in my vehicle so I do not have to run the A/C all the time. Saves me lots in fuel.
B00EZZPOZM|1|This item didn't work (repeater) and I paid return label.
B00KPQZS2O|1|This looks like a China knock off - Tst with st in small case is a way around the copyright laws<br /><br />TST 507 is listed in caps and the model number - sensors look different also!<br /><br />Be warned
B00FOVKC62|1|Returned it . it was very cheaply made . didnt like it at all
B00LGKJ17G|3|was cool, just be careful in the sun. got sun bleached in the car
B006B287VK|5|Installed in a flash and fit perfectly. Braking action is very good. I'm happy and satisfied with my purchase. Installed on V star 1300 rear brake.
B0022ZXO40|3|Was smaller than expected.
B005G5SDLW|2|Shield has a slight dimple or optic flaw just at eye level which causes a annoying distortion.
B008TTHC00|5|Perfect fit for my 5 year old son!
B0052WHK2W|5|Cheaper than buying factory and transferable to other vehicles. Very secure and never worried about them moving. Lock feature is nice.
B000NBVFN2|5|as advertised
B00N4FWOE8|5|Perfect if you have the correct ceiling racks
B00UNFRR1M|5|Excellent car wash. As long you make your mix proper the car looks like it was just polished after a wash.<br />Buy it...love it. Also it helps a lot with water spots.
B006WQSGPW|5|we just had it put in seems great.
B00JG4O5V6|1|It's water proof I agree and give full credits but definitely not 3M thinsulate as it is claimed.  At 10 degrees centigrade my fingers were freezing and switched to regular woolen gloves. Not a good product. Not worth the money.
B001EOV492|4|appears to be good quality - received it quickly
B00SZK1PA6|5|Super bright, great upgrade for my truck. Consistent color temperature.  Seems like even more output than my halogen projectors, now I need to get the Opt-7 bulbs for my projectors.  Installed in 5 minutes, perfect replacement fit, well worth it.
B00EP3PUV2|3|Easy install and looked great for first few months, now I am getting rust coming out from underneath the foot pads which is quite disappointing(Stainless!?!?!?) Guess I should have spent a few more bucks...
B003UTZ4RC|5|Did what I was wishing. The slip joint in my Toyota pick up was sticking. making it bind when coming to stop. I cleaned joint and lube with this  grease and works great.
B00655EQRM|5|Great product works very well. Cleans the tire very well and leaves a good shine
B001G7EJTO|1|doesn't fit. maybe you should list what it fits in so people don't waste their money. but as far as the e21 and who else know what it doesnt fit.
B005N6XC8S|3|Runs very small.  Material has a translucent pattern which is interesting.  Fits very tight around the arms too.  Cute shirt, I just wish material was a little more stretchy since the cut is so tight.
B001D9E41I|3|This works just fine but the price is a bit high. After buying this, I bought a couple of rolls of it and did our entire rv for much less money than this cost. It is nice that it is bound on the edges but I find it is not really necessary. It does come with easy attachments though.
B001B5EEEQ|5|Clutch has been working for one month and so far so good.
B00H5F3RSU|1|BEWARE these are not anodized and the color will fade quickly. I put a black set on a car that spends 75% of its time in a garage. They turned brown within 6 months.
B00N3PU22A|5|These are amazing! The projector and the surrounding LED's are very bright. I love these as my reverse lights on my Vibe, they look like fog lights coming on. Perfect for the tint on my windows, now i don't need to roll em down to see back in the mirrors.
B004O9WC18|5|Fits perfect looks great and easy to clean.
B000AMLWH8|1|Not up to my expectation
B00WF91VI4|4|Love having the camera in my horse trailer. Use it everytime I go anywhere. Picture is ok, but not as clear as I would have liked, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Picture can be grainy and has lines through it but I can still see the horses.
B00NAIS5PQ|5|They worked great!
B00D834U9I|3|Not to loud Received it fast delivery
B00HPTLFNK|5|very good
B009DJP202|5|Great product and customer service.
B007FHSDM8|5|Great product and fast shipping!
B00GTVPX5G|5|Looks and sounds great
B00CXDVM2W|5|Seems to fit pretty well and has some custom features. Really does fir the ZR-1 not a basic Corvette. Appears to be well made and hopefully will keep water from seeping inside. Hate to park it outside, but there is just not enough space for all the toys. Good contingency plan.
B00LMMJVPU|2|They look a bit cheap!
B009PHEXTS|5|Good value.  SEEMS LIKE A QUALITY ITEM
B005DJFYX6|5|These are great for fast trips out to the barn, as well as, riding horses or motorcycles.  I would buy more in the future.
B004ZF39TA|5|Installed on 08/24/2015 - Great product! Very easy to install; simple plug and play in my case. No drilling or modification to the wiring required. Total install time of about 20 minutes for both fog lights. If they don't light up at first just switch the factory harness around and they should light up with no problems. They didn't come with zip ties as stated in the instructions but I always have some extra lying around. I used extra large ones to secure the ballasts to the frame/bumper, and smaller ones to secure wiring. Very happy with the way they look. Will be ordering the low beams and high beams next.
B00UYMRNOU|5|I was skeptical about these lights solely by the price. I installed two on my plow truck and am truly happy and suprised! They are very bright and simple to install. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a light upgrade or an add on to existing.
B00KTIZK30|5|Great replacement keyfob at an awesome price. Came with a battery and took 10 seconds to program with easy instructions. I thought it would feel flimsy and cheap for the price but it feels and looks the same as the original to me.
B00OU6BFBS|1|not refreshing or fragrant. the scent does not last for a week.
B0039538RK|5|This part fit perfectly over the unsightly access holes behind the door pull of my '02 Corvette. It has snaps that lock into place when you push it into the holes. I recently bought the car and the previous owner didn't have the covers to begin with. Hopefully they don't fall out again, but if they do.. the part is only ten bucks each. The black color of this part matches the black interior pretty well. I would definitely recommend.
B00A74CDOA|4|A lot better quality than expected. Fast shipping. Great item.
B000ICCS7I|4|Good product
B00JVC0OKO|5|Forgot about heating of LT1 after installing it. Now the camaro remains mid temp, with 4 seated with AC, mid day summer going up steep road.
B004LF15QI|5|This works great to protect my 5th wheel hitch and reasonably priced
B0030CNG5Q|5|Perfect direct replacement good quality part
B005CWA6QY|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00JVVVBMK|5|Very practical in that having an o-ring seal assures no loss of pressure.
B000CFUP9O|4|worked out good fit right no leaks .
B00BTLEIIY|2|Horribly cheaply made.  Threads next to zippers started coming apart while trying to place over the seat.  Will return immediately!
B0049URTY2|5|Ok
B000AM8BJU|5|Great spray wax. It is cheap and works well. I tend to spray my car down everyday so this is my go to product.
B00KDOKWT2|5|I love the decal! It was a bit bigger than the Operation Iraqi Freedom but love the size. Don't see too many veterans who support being in OEF but I'm the first in my area. Thanks, seller!
B001IZKDYE|5|Very good product for those that don't have indoor storage available to them.  ...and you can still get in and out of your camper.
B00I7ELJWE|5|Perfect fit at a discounted price.
B00KTHUXKQ|5|LOOKS OEM QUICK SHIPPING
B01092ICIA|4|Awesome very nice
B00UVE6POU|5|Really cool
B001DAM6IA|5|It works great. It was a easy swap out as long as you have a timing light to adjust it to spec, 8 before time on my old 87 s10. I replaced it in my truck a month before needing to take a 1,500 mile round trip across Texas. The truck ran perfectly on the 16 hr drive and still runs good now 3 weeks later. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a new distributer.
B001C9BZJS|5|2005 Dodge Durango 5.7L, 72k on engine, 12k on new belt.  Started getting an occasional rattle or tapping and traced it down to the idler pulley.  Could see the original one moving cyclically at idle, figured it was hitting one of the stops.  Got this one, looks like it might even be OEM.  Made in Canada like mentioned by others.  Same belt, all better, no more fluttering at idle.  Have heard of people having issues with replacement belts causing the same thing if they're not exactly the same length as OEM so be aware if you're looking at this for the same issue.
B003RYOWH8|5|will last long....
B00H2YCX48|4|Was cool girlfriend liked
B00APM0AKS|2|Great price not all will fit they are different sizes kind of odd
B00TO2WEH2|3|It is a really cute product I was happy when I first purchased it however the material is not a good quality and it was bleached/became faded in the Sun very quickly.
B002L29FEM|5|GOOD PRODUCT, NO HASSLE, I RECOMMEND.
B00C7DAUFS|5|These bulbs fitted just right for my Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Same color as the original set.
B00686XGK6|1|Was nothing like the picture shows...
B011O250MA|5|Multiple plugs, in one order! This would be perfect for a mechanic, or someone who works on cars a lot. This set comes with many different cords to connect a scanner to many different vehicles. You will need the scanner, but each one I used seemed very easy to use, and came with a print out showing which plug went to which car...eliminating the guess work. Nice affordable purchase. I received this order for an honest and unbiased opinion.
B0085F1736|5|Great for riding!
B001UROU08|3|Was a bit too small for me gave them to a lady friend but a good product nonetheless.
B005NLQAHS|4|Works good
B00F5MUB66|5|This shower head is amazing! What an improvement over the shower head that came with our RV. So easy to install, highly recommended!
B00480BWA0|4|works great
B003TKI4VU|2|Not much light for the money.
B00TA7GN1E|5|Just what I was looking for.  Used it for my outdoor shower on the camper.
B00GSAUHB8|5|As described, really covers whole windshield. Definitely blocks out the sun and makes my dark green colored car more bearable in the heat. As stated, do measure before buying, as is very large, with great coverage. Great transaction and shipping.<br />5 Stars
B00BD4SM9S|4|I was surprised how inexpensive these were, so I gave them a chance.  They are as good a quality as ones I bought a few years ago for triple the price.
B00LDXUFGW|5|Great! Quality really nice product!
B009P0QGRM|2|It works alright. Usually takes a long time to find the signal, after you have it set up. Base must be level, and you need to set the elevation manually. If anything is not set properly, and you don't have a very clear line of sight into the sky, you won't get a signal from the satellite.  I suggest spending the extra money and get a FULLY automatic unit....
B00PE36I4U|4|The sticker is beautiful.. I have two autistic sons.. So I put this on my car and I love it
B000I14RY6|2|broke during first use
B00OZX6LII|4|Went on easy. They look pretty good and are functional. I like that they are angled close to the car and not sticking out too far. Minor issue is an increase in wind noise but you won't notice if you listen to music.
B003EOH91W|5|After reading many positive reviews I still wasn't convinced that I would see a tremendous difference between my stock shocks and the Bilsteins.  I have a 2012 JKU with 35's.  The ride quality is 100% better than stock shocks!  Don't get me wrong, it still drives like a Jeep, but I'm no longer being tossed around with every bump/pothole on the road.  Super smooth and there's definitely less body roll through the corners.  By far one of the best purchases I've made for the Jeep.
B0052FRP06|5|Great part direct fit good quality
B000JFRHZ2|4|Fits my Tiger 800 with top box and side cases on. Heat treated panels are only on the back 1/3rd of the cover, so watch out for contact with the engine. Over all works well for when I have to park outside.
B004VF48YO|3|Give it three stars mainly for ease of installation. Have to say it didn't meet my expections as we couldn't get any additional channels.  We get one channel (same as old antenna) but in spring we could get three channels with old antenna.
B00B1TMPR0|5|Best kickstand on the market
B0010GFW88|5|Item arrived as advertised, excellent packing. Had a hard time mounting it, but it worked like a charm.
B007XWU54E|5|Perfect Fit!  Arrived well packed and in good condition.  This fit our 2000 Honda Civic coupe EX perfectly.  As others have stated loosely fit the bolts/nuts as you assemble the entire exhaust system.  Then tighten everything after all is lined up and in place.  Also, it helps to lube the rubber exhaust hanger holes before pushing the metal hanger rod through.
B00GYI1ICQ|5|solid metal mount easy to install works well
B00AKFS49E|4|Took a little while to get the left side on and straight. But overall good sound and nice look on the bike. Could use a heatshield on the corners of the crossover pipe to keep from scraping the actual exshast  in hard corners. However I would recommend  this.
B00K7938O4|5|like it
B00VNBEBCS|4|I bought these to replace blown out OEM bulbs for 2006 f-150 installation was super easy as long as your not a dimwit, these are so much brighter, safer, just a great product!
B00CH6T18C|4|Works well, good conditioner but don't expect miracles, leather that's cracked and dried too much isn't going to comeback to life but BooYah does a great job keeping your leather goods from becoming cracked and dried. No smell, no greasy film, great for car seats.
B0044A8JJ6|5|Well packaged but I did order the wrong part. I needed one with a xenon hi-beam and the housing could not be modified easily to accommodate the xenon. However, I did use the lense and the gaskets which should solve my water problem...
B000NSJ91K|5|WORKS WONDERFUL
B00KVDOQJ2|5|these look great! Work great in the rain, make my truck looks good and I'm very happy
B00120EXOQ|5|We used 6 of these cleats hung vertically as coat hooks in our mudroom locker system.  They look amazing and go well in our subtle, nautical themed home near Lake Michigan.
B00FC22PVS|3|These keep blowing, they replaced under lifetime  warranty but now they are ignoring me
B0045WBVUM|5|This is great.  As I am headed to 50, my ass has disappeared and bone has replaced it.  This is a nice added cushion that breathes well, and this size fit my GS1200 perfect.  You just need to play with the air pressure unitl if feels just right, more air is not better.  Would buy again.
B00AM1Z67O|4|Didn't notice a diff between this and regular oil but it didn't cause problems either.
B007IPSXFO|1|doesnt work been waiting for a response so i can send it back but nothing as of yet
B000F6DNMQ|5|Thanks
B005VPS2UE|5|Arrived on time.  Packaged well.  I actually am using this on a 2009 Ford Ranger.  2009 did not come with cargo lamps.  I retrofitted this by tapping into the interior dome lamp to power the cargo lamps.  I have had no issues with leaks from the seal and it did rain last night.
B00TTLR8VK|5|Smells so good
B00KTIUM5G|1|What the seller sent me didn't work as it should. so far I was a sent a fob that the spring key doesn't swing out unless you pull it out by hand. So at this point I have no confidence that this key or the remaining key could be programed .<br /><br />I was sent keys that look like they were returns or at the very least used.<br /><br />No logos but that's fine flip key I don't think so I'll update this when I can't get them programed<br /><br />If I was playing the odds on this one I would not bet on this horse two 1 star s and two 2 stars and one 3 stars  reviews with only one 5 star review odds are this horse is headed to the glue factory earlier than later
B004RCT0LM|5|Easy to setup and works as claimed
B0033WNJBO|3|Had to drill holes in my new cars frame...sad face
B00PBENGUG|4|I love these.
B00J2R4ZAI|5|100% advisable
B004TC1M5C|5|Perfect fit. Very sturdy. GREAT price ☺
B005BNP7SQ|1|Wish I had paid more attention to the reviews. Looks good, for the 45 days it lasted. The G and M still work, but only part of the C lights up.
B0049MIXKO|5|Plenty Long enough, the ground wire could, should have been longer, great product
B00V2VF86W|5|100% advisable
B000QV0GDY|5|Worked great!!
B00EAZVWNA|5|Nuvi 2757 fits snugly in cradle. Dock was tight enough that I did not remove the back screws and replace them to screw into the holder.<br />Screws are so tiny you will need a magnifying glass to do it.
B000C9FE3C|5|the original orifice was clogged and nasty good thing I got this and changed the old one out.  you may find YouTube for orifice change on a 2003 GMC I have a tahoe and the design for the tube is much different so anyone that goes to replace this and has something similar to mine just remember the orifice tube is in the same location just has a removable pipe that it sits in.  the design is so if you get the tube stuck in the line you can pull the whole thing and push the orifice tube out.  Just thought I would add that little bit of info...
B00O83KLS6|1|Halos burnt out in 3 days and low beams are terrible awful product
B00PJW47Z8|1|Their fitting is for a very very small car.  It's supposed to fit regular size but it didn't fit my 2005 Mercedes C230 sedan, which is small sedan.  Also, I've returned the product but they haven't credited me back yet. I sent it back to them over 3 weeks ago.
B004WLK314|5|I saw some pictures of a few other Australian shepherd owners that had this decal and I laughed a bit too hard. Since I was about to adopt my own Aussie I wanted to be part of the club and decided this needed to go on my car. It looks great and stuck on just fine. As long as you follow instructions on the back of the decal/sticker and you should have no problems!
B000CSGX9C|5|Always an excellent product and prompt delivery via Amazon.
B0016IABBI|5|Good quality
B00LG07MZE|5|This sunshade works great. I does take a little practice to fold it back into its case properly. I would recommend this sunshade to anyone that wants to protect their car's interior from the sun.”
B003BWD0AG|4|Thanks
B006HSOIRK|3|Covers are great but took some time for shipping
B005RSUOTW|5|Looks good on my car, really contrasts well with silver. I can pick it out from a fair distance.
B00PC4KL6M|1|it flew off the next day ...it didn't have good adhesvive
B000KZ25NK|5|Great
B007ZLLS76|5|Mechanic installed.  No problems.
B002X6VXL4|5|Does the job. It appears well made and durable.
B00AWPIJ92|5|Looks great and works great!
B007RVQVBC|5|Easy to install, works great, cost much less than Honda Dealer
B008XIQ5KA|5|Good tools, quick delivery.
B00A14QNP6|5|A perfect replacement for my broken one. Could only open passenger windows from driver side. Now my passengers can open their own window without asking me to do it for them.
B00UVXDIS2|5|proudly displayed
B002R4VESO|5|First time I have ever bought a &#34;used item&#34;.  Obviously someone bought the wrong size and returned.  Shoes look 100% new.  Saved me $40.
B00OMDHI7Y|4|Good quality kit. It was (as I suspected) a Madjax product. The installation instructions included with it were not clear, and I drilled some unneeded holes in my seat supports trying to make it fit. It was not until I downloaded a different version of the instructions that it became clear how it all goes together.
B00VUXTHBE|4|It went in easily and worked, and only took 5 minutes to finish. A mediocre date night.
B00AVSG4PQ|5|One original broke on my bed, would lock and then refuse to unlock until you mysteriously held your mouth right and stood on one foot with toes pointed east, replaced them both easy in 30 minutes to do both and so far they work well.
B0018E6T0M|1|Not good at all they started to fall apart after the first couple weeks of purchasing them no good for inside of the car when its hot inside. &#34;Poorly made&#34;
B002LPFM3C|5|great product
B00XCT8XQ4|3|Would be better if it came with the install instruction and so on.....
B000GUWOGM|5|A must if you own a KLR 650!! The direction are a bit confusing but one call to progressive cleared that up!!
B00ECGP5E4|5|These are very nicely priced.  They fit the handlebar well and  are chrome plated and add style to the motorcycle.  I love them.
B00GBQ3YXM|5|Great product. installation is easy and the material is durable.Its was the perfect hitch kit, had all the items we needed in one package at a great price. Seller delivered on time and in great condition.
B00GCEI3XO|5|Really great product!!!!!
B0085YJFMC|5|Good Job !!
B009AA9WVY|4|Work's no problem
B0002MBBIQ|2|No matter how much your tighten them down your just don't feel like they are secure.
B0081SB818|4|slight modification to fit my bracket, but installed easily after replacing split pin with original pin from old alt. works great .
B0053O8ENS|1|LOW QUALITY!  Buy the Outland Contractors console instead (available on Amazon).  This Pilot brand product looks good in the pictures, but don't be fooled it's made from flimsy plastic and the hinges look as if they may snap easily. I live a busy life and waited too long to return his thing and got stopped by their 30 day return policy and got stuck with it.
B00IQ2Z0D6|5|Just great!
B004YJT8H4|2|With less then 30K miles of city and highway driving, absolutely nothing off-road, both shocks had to be replaced.  I don't pull a trailer or haul anything either.  Don't by these.
B004PC4AQY|4|They fit pretty good on my Gsxr 2006
B007WZS41I|5|Arrived quickly, easy to set up and work great!!!
B003BXATVS|2|I purchased for an 2001 Dodge 2500. When I put cover on seat the holes for the seat belt that come from headrest don't line up well and the seat cut out for the bend of the back rest is too big. Looked liked it was going to catch getting into seat. That is were the wear pattern is in original seat.  For the price I didn't want to take the chance of them not wearing well.  I returned them. Material and craftsmanship are nice. The overall fit was better than other covers I have seen. Wish they would have been a little more customized.
B00062ZDAO|4|GREAT
B00MUP687W|5|Alright, I was very skeptical about this product due to the price and the brand but it works very well. My parking idle is about 250 rpms higher than my D4 idle but that's not really an issue since I don't put the car in park while I idle in traffic.  Can't beat the price!  Works well. Very impressed.  Honda civic 2000 EX 2dr d16y8  Update: I purchased this August the 6th it is now November 12th. It has been three months since I installed the IACV. Car has not given me any trouble and idle is fine. I am very pleased with this IACV. My parking idle is about 250 RPMS higher than the 650-750 idle range but once its in D4 the idle is perfect with little fluctuation.
B0034ZUZM6|5|seems as the ad said great price just installed have not used it yet other than testing it
B002WFBA0A|5|Looks good
B004K25HDE|3|This looks really nice after 3 days of installing. Not a bolt on that is for sure, a lot of drilling and cutting required. You need a dremmel and a good drill. Would of rated higher but I had to modify all the mounting brackets because the where to high for my f250 2014.
B000ABCH6E|4|Liquid Wrench is a product I know can gradually unfreeze frozen mechanics, such as something stuck on a shaft. My father and I essentially repaired the complex workings of a nickelodeon which had not been in use for almost a century, by applying this and then rotating the parts by hand, then repeating until theinstrument worked again. However, I was disappointed on this recent occasion, in which I had pulleys almost frozen on a shaft. I applied this, and it helped right away, but when I returned the next day, the machine had frozen again, because the substance had evaporated. After a few days of doing the same thing, I went to an old hardware store, where I purchased heavy machine oil, and that resolved the problem completely. This being said, I still regard it as an essential for repairing frozen machinery, but it's not a permanent fix. By the way, I do not advise the spray version of this. If you are not careful, it will shoot back in your face. That's why I ordered this squeeze bottle, because the spray I purchased at a hardware store got me in the face.
B00OM2UDKE|5|great product.fits liike a glove
B00RM2AT96|5|A week after I put these hand guards on , the bike fell over in a gravel parking lot nothing got hurt except the hand guard slider on the left side. WHEW !  I was really p.o'd  till I realized all I need to replace is a $ 9.90 replacement part. It could of cost a few hundred  easily. I rate it $$$ well spent.<br />JOE
B00HZ403FG|5|Swing away frame arrived very well packed to protect the finish.<br />The frame itself is a very heavy gauge tubular steel  ....nothing cheap about it. It is a very heavy duty carrier that when is opened allows complete access to the cargo area of a pick up even with the tailgate down.<br /> The frame has basically 3 different points to prevent it from coming open while you are hauling it down the road 1) hitch latch with a lift up lever that is spring loaded 2) a threaded bolt that screws into welded on nut  3) a pin that is meant to hold the frame open also helps keeps it closed when folded shut<br />. They do offer a grill that was gas but I wanted charcoal so I constructed a frame for my grill and mounted it to a board that mounts to the carrier using the mounting holes for my own version of a  swing away hitch mounted grill.<br /> If you have any questions don't hesitate  to contact their customer service as they are very helpful with any questions that you may have.<br /> I would also like to add that the hitch tightner that is included takes all the wobble out of the carrier when it is mounted in your receiver hitch.
B00BY9XKWQ|5|Great product, super fast shipping. Giving it a 5 Stars at the least .
B00PHYTLYK|5|Beautiful
B00K7YMK3Y|5|Yes I love this decal I've been looking for this one evertwhere.
B00BITICRA|5|Great. the part was fairer in color than the image and was delivered earlier than the estimated delivery date. was very satisfied with the delivery
B0018EV9QQ|5|worked great on the Sturgis trip, several rain storms hit.  thanks much.
B00AYXM4DY|5|good
B006N9392I|5|Great
B00ML7G5X6|5|Way better than what hope for.
B00B2AFT2G|5|Worked awesome with my 2inch shackles, easy install too, I don't recommend using this kit with the supreme 2inch shackle tho, because the shackle is a little wider then the provided shackle mount, I would just use the rough country shackle. Seems to go together easier.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Lightweight, packs down very small, and fits great on our Subaru Impreza's windshield.
B009DIWNQ4|5|Good filter for the money..lid on air cleaner slightly raised after install so fit on an 87 chevy van 5.7 was a little too tall but I'm happy cause now it's getting a little more air and you can hear the growl like flipping the air cleaner lid when you were a kid lol
B0040CVYCC|5|I started having an issue with my passenger headlight going out.  I decided to search Amazon for a replacement.  This was the item I needed for less then the local parts chains.  The product shipped fast, was solid quality and a generous length of wire on the pigtail.  Some self sealing crimp connectors and the problem on my truck was repaired.  OEM or better was my only need.
B00265BWK4|4|Very good and it actually fit
B00E1SM6D6|5|Great hubs for a great price... not a easy install but sure made a difference once I did.  my 4 low locks in much better now and I don't have that horrible noise when I turn the wheels like I did before when I was locked in 4 high.  Someone was saying that the plugs for the abs where different, although that was not the case with the ones I received they where just like factory and plugged in with no issues what so ever.
B00AN5MZ2I|5|Great fit
B003ZWHF9E|5|Great inexpensive product. Still functions.
B009B9QLJU|5|Nice
B00TA9X392|5|Came really quick. Works better than a regular grinder specially on welds and lasts longer than the regular rolocs I buy. Careful though, needs a light touch specially on sheetmetals. For 50 cents a piece, will definitely buy again.
B00HYJSIMM|2|This thing takes up too much room and cuts my riders legs in two if it is moved rearward so I don't have to sit forward on the bike. wish we would have went with the other seat back.
B00HS5V3Y2|5|It was a good purchase and it arrived earlier then estimated.
B000CPJMFM|5|Fit fine, looks great, fast delivery.
B00HIXTL48|4|Shipped fast and great quality
B00ARJQGFW|1|Returned the first one for being faulty. Got the same results with the replacment. Checked the product to make sure it was for my car and engine, it was. Stated it worked for 1999-2000 Jettas 2.0 but clearly it does not. Or, dare I say, the extremely low priced part was just junk to begin with. My conclusion came as I was driving and the car lost all power, was able to get it started but would not stay running. Pulled the maf harness from the sensor and voila! The car started. Actually ran better than it ever did with this maf installed. Idled rough but never stalled like with this sensor plugged in. Not even worth $28....
B00F9K3JKO|4|Super easy to apply and looks great on my laptop.<br /><br />Now when I go to conferences and over to friends' where my Mac is one in a sea of Macs, I'll know instantly which one is mine.
B00I505688|5|Good quailty made in America! Raised exactly 2.25&#34; after alinement. Make sure to follow the directions. You will have to cut the studs on your stock strut mounts about 3/8&#34; shorter. This is common on most lift spacers. I would recommend a differental drop to take some strain off the c/v joints. Spacers are a great deal and would buy them again.
B00FFH182C|5|Nice product and quick delivery
B00UUGOYAQ|5|It works like a charm. J. D. Does't stock this item had to make so I made do hickey and fix each year.
B000C2WFA4|5|love it!<br />whats more to say?
B00KHUQ9NK|4|Installed easily, and gives a good grip, looks good, but stinks of rubber for a week or so.
B00A5VEDQ6|5|Fits perfectly on a 2015 Passat Wolfsburg.
B000GZEK00|5|Ordered two for my 2003 BMW 325xi as preventative maintenence, with a O2 socket it was the easiest time I've ever had putting O2's in. Wires were the correct length with the correct connector, even came with anti-seize already on the threads. Very happy!
B0000AXNMO|5|Rain-x is Amazing! Helps me see on a raining drives and keeps the bugs from sticking.<br /><br />Also works great on my GoPro for clear images/videos when doing water sports.
B001UP0ENM|4|The new cylinder WORKS!<br />  My quibbles are relatively minor. Firstly, the cylinder was shipped inside its thin pasteboard off-the-shelf container, the whole unit being stuffed inside a manila/bubblewrap post office envelope. There was no obvious damage, but that was a lucky break. Secondly, I had a fair amount of difficulty fitting the new cylinder into its receiver hole...either the unit was slightly bent in transit, or the tolerances were tighter than those of the OEM unit. Finally, the metal cover into which the key fits seems to be a cheaper grade of metal than that of the original unit, and occasionally the key will catch on a slightly jagged edge, and require jiggling to fit.
B001C6Q7US|1|Product finally arrived. After the initial &#34;USPS&#34;  loss... Was told in two different emails on two different dates, several  days apart, a part went out..  After 3 weeks I get a part.. Works great... Things happen beyond ones control accepted.. From a nonperfect person... I leave you this... Be<br />upfront do what you say and say what you mean.
B000MDZLR2|5|The tire cover fits perfectly on my spare. Looks perfect very happy.
B0009H51MG|5|Good replcement, fits just like oem.
B013KOGN5I|5|Fast delivery, the key and remote worked great for my 2012 Ford Fusion.
B0042ORVJI|1|this is sheet metal, not steel and not twice as thick as the original. as soon as i applied the brake it broke in half. compltete junk.  metal bends in your hand. do not buy this people.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I bought this sun protector for my Mercury Villager 1996. It fits pretty good. May be a little higher could be better.
B00VGL7E5G|5|Nice, well made, fits well & very heavy duty.
B00ZSB1WP8|5|Work wonderfully. Very happy with our purchase.
B01289R5IU|5|These are very thick and strong and keep the dirt and water off my carpet and in the mats.  The Zone Tech 3 Piece Gray Premium Quality floor mats are working out great.  They are made with rubber material that is thick and the grooves are deep enough to hold all the dirt that I track from my dirt driveway and water from rain, mud and snow, they are really heavy duty and will hold up to a whole lot of dirt and grim.<br /><br />They fit nicely in the front of the car and the back mat covers both sides and over the middle hump, so it protects the entire back area and not just the two sides.  The gray matches my gray carpet and keeps them from sticky out like a sore thumb.  These mats are good quality and have really made a big difference for me in my car.  I no longer have to worry overtime it rains or snows about getting water and mud in my carpet, and with the rubber mats I can just vacuum the dirt out of the mats and if they get really dirty I can just take them out and wash them and put them back in.  My carpet is thanking me.  The carpet in my car was getting so ruined and packed with dirt and these are saving the day and my carpet.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review of the product.
B00Z89I2OY|5|Great
B0071NLXZU|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00MIZT7OK|5|Bought this as a gift for one of my favorite cat-loving girlies that lives in the city after she posted a horrid tale on Facebook about someone bothering her.  I am way excited to give it to her.
B01091VVGQ|4|Quality built product. Has a thin foam pad to protect the paint, which is nice. My only disappointment is that bolts/nylon washers are not included (which is stated). You will need pick up some 5/16&#34;-18 x 1.5&#34; long button head stainless steel bolts. (Don't quote me on the length, but they will need to be about 1/2&#34; longer than the factory bolts) I also added some nylon washers. Overall, very nice construction. Just wished there were bolts included. Lastly, I bought a 52&#34; LED light bar and I had to add (2x) 3/8&#34; nylon spacers on each side of the light bar to fill the gap. Otherwise, the brackets would get &#34;pulled&#34; in too far and not be able to tighten down the light bar. All in all, no big issues. The company &#34;Xtreme Work&#34; that sells this item has great communication and was nice enough to issue me a refund after a slight price drop. Good people.
B00BCRMBGQ|5|confident I'll be able to keep the seats in better condition, a little confusing to put on, no clear instructions
B004HMBK5G|5|I can't drive or ride in a car without these!
B00MEFH3JA|5|Perfect! My husband loves it
B00652G4TS|5|I work as a mechanic professionally and often have to diagnose check engine lights and Abs lights and this thing works great! Compared to basic scan tools that cost twice the price i would say this blows them out of the water, the fact that it can live stream, read abs,trans, and engine codes, conduct smog check and give you reports for common issues this product is a no brainer, i love it. Technical support responds to questions quickly and effectively. All in all, great tool, great price, great buy worth every penny!  Update: 2-3-2017  For anybody using this professionally dont forget about your saved reports, just saved my ass been looking for it for a month and forgot about saved reports looked up the last vehicle in our shop history called the customer and sure enough it was still plugged in! Saved me a 100$!
B0002JMIEK|5|Great price, best wax on the market
B003172AAW|5|Love this alum. Filter
B000EOR1JK|4|Great Cover I wish the attachment for support bars where more secure but easy to reattach Only issue I have had is being in 100+ degree weather is seamed to get loose readjusted working fine. Great Product
B002VPL6AA|5|Perfect fit
B0031BTCQS|5|Easy install,  quality construction,  I installed this on my 2015 Raider bullet cowl.  My only issue is the price.  I feel that these accessory parts for motorcycles are way over priced regardless of the manufacture!
B007Y691X0|5|works great
B00OZV2XTG|5|Very nice mat set for new mustangs.  The logo is very attractive and the fit is very good.
B001EP0G72|5|Good plug, just look at the wiring online before hooking up.
B000A3I9XW|1|The handle fell off on first use.  I was able to use super glue to fix it. Nonetheless, unacceptable quality.
B006H34AE6|5|BESTY&#60; BEST&#60; BEST !!  I really wasn't expecting it to work like it does - I am amaze!  It digs in with little effort and gets hair, lint, dust - EVERYTHING out!  I do recommend having your vacuums handy when you start - the fur detaches and needs collected right away.
B007USCM7E|4|I was surprised you could buy these on line. Worked like a champ and easy to use. Have cold A/C now.
B004HCM9H4|5|I'm really happy with the results of this week.  One bottle made it through an F150 and another SUV with some left over.  I used a DA polisher and it was very easy to remove the wax with a microfiber cloth.
B00KBKOAGY|1|I have only owned this for about 7 months. I flipped it down and up maybe a total of 10 times over that time. The visor already broke off one of the hinges from fatigue. The issue is that the pivot point has too much resistance and over time, it will fatigue and eventually break at the bend radius where there is a stress concentration. Picture attached.
B00IOUJ72U|5|Love it.
B005BNZFQ0|5|Emergency TESLA charging!
B00AMPJ554|5|I'm not sure of the reviews saying their trunk doesn't close properly. Works just fine on my 98 Mustang GT
B00NGSROPW|5|Very good
B00ISLA20G|1|Came with no directions and did not fit in my Toyota tundra bef
B00KTHY2DA|5|This is a great product! So inexpensive and easy to use. My last FOB wore through at the ring. I pulled out the electronics and put them into this one. The whole process took about 3 minutes. It snaps nice and tight. It worked perfectly and has been for a week now. You should keep one of these around at all times - at least when you see you're current one starting to get too worn at the ring. I'd definitely buy this again. I did NOT receive this item free or for a discount in exchange for my review.
B00KTHX8N0|5|I got a second key fob and it was too expensive to get a second key cut out so I ordered this product and it works perfect to hang from my Keychain, plus it looks better than a key fob pouch.
B00F7H0C0O|5|Excellent graffics really looks great on my car.Very easy to install .I would recommend this product.
B000C2QPG4|4|Overall dimensions were OK, but location of connectors/pipes were off and difficult to adjust. Couldn't get the housing to fit quite right during re-assembly and now have a slight whistle sound when A/C is running. As far as cooling, it works great, blowing out cold air.
B000C0UMOW|5|Perfect...good price..quick shipping
B0077K8WJC|4|fast shipping, item was as described
B00MWNZ51C|1|These wipers are awful. They skip over the windshield leaving water streaks, then clean it up partially on the return wipe. Will be replacing soon.
B00Q1F7CZ4|4|A little tight getting the bulb ring back on, but it worked.
B00AYAICW4|5|My car is kept under a messy tree so it has shade, but the windshield always has twigs and junk on and under it.  These wipers are awesome.  I don't have to take pin oak leaves out from under my wiper blades every day before I drive my car.  This fits so tight and is well made so nothing gets under it.  I love it and am ordering another one just to keep on hand.  (I drive a Mazda by the way)
B000E7DM04|5|I have been looking for a 3&#34; Filter that could fit directly on my wifes turbo 4g eclipse, this one works due to the small overall diameter!
B001C92Y16|5|Outstanding quality and excellent. The fitment is perfect. Further  the brake in coating is good for my old rotor.
B00VVR4BII|1|This is not a very good kit at all the torsion bar unloading tool did not fit over the crossmember and had to be modified so it could be used and also the shock spacers for the wrong size to get over the shock studs they had to be drilled out to fit overall very displeased with this kit
B00AMLQ7KE|5|These look great on the truck. For the price you can not beat them. Reading previous reviews definitely helped with the installation since the rear brackets are packaged wrong. At a slow pace you will have these installed in under 2 hours
B00BTLEIIY|5|Very well made, fits perfectly to my Ford Escape. Color, texture and thickness of fabric is good.
B00WM41LZA|4|Excellent price. No cruise control.
B00KTAUK3S|1|Although the product came on time I wonder if it's any good. The lawnmower still want crank.  I just wonder if the carburetor is any good? I have changed everything on it that can possibly be wrong. :(
B000AMZJXQ|5|Huge difference for me. My bulbs were old and way overdue. Wow what a nice improvement in night vision.
B00BSEJYCM|5|Great, I replaced my old batteries used in a solar lamp and now works fantastics, good pack and delivered on time
B00IU158JY|5|Product came in genuine honda replacement part packaging. The delivery was fast. The product itself was of great build quality and literally took me 5 minutes to install. The slide in the cup holder slides like a dream. Overall pleased with this and would buy again!
B0009NZL34|5|Easy to install love it
B000BQRQT6|5|great sevice
B00RNIU1E2|4|Quick and easy install... Kinda miss my mirrors though :(
B00JF5LRN0|5|I've had this for several months, and use it 5 days a wk for my job. Heavier and sturdier than it looks. Had 300# on it w no prob. Absolutely silent when i drive, no rattles at all.  Only concern was not enough reflectors on it, easily fixed w cheap reflector tape from ebay.
B003V3RVWI|5|Really great!!
B004C6Q46M|5|Awesome product- well worth the price/deal.  Install cant get any more straightforward.
B005NLQAHS|2|The tool is supposed to work with my Windows laptop using the free software included with the interface. The software is crap. I tried then all. There doesn't seem to be any way to configure the ports for access to the tool. No documentation is included or available online. It may work just fine on Android, but I don't own a smartphone. If you need a scan tool to use on Windows, look elsewhere.
B00S0UVNN0|5|Bought one, then 1000 miles later, another for the other side.  Both have been holding up well so far.  Direct fit for my 4x4 avalanche.  ABS sensor/wire included so I didn't have to mess with that.  No issues so far with either of them!
B000BR51BK|5|Great product.
B00JV1U91O|1|Purchase from aFe directly since i live local to them for 2013 ram 2500 6.7....nothing but problems ,intake keeps setting off p2281 check engine light which in turn puts truck in limp mode, called aFe many times even went down there, and they couldn't even figure out why, i even updated to the latest flash up dates but still get a check engine light, they sent me a different filter and intake tube but still same problem, THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T RUSH THINGS IN TO PRODUCTION WITH OUT TESTING FIRST, i called Banks performance and there currently testing there intake before they release it to the public...so I'm going to return this back to aFe and wait for the Banks unit
B008HIULYC|5|Very good
B001KVW6EQ|5|This item was so easy to use and it comes in a beautiful blue bag with a drawstring.  It was easy to get out and easy to add to the existing seat belt.
B0019COQ6C|5|best gift ever my husband said :)
B0033YK9A6|5|This plugged right in to the OE spot for a 2006 Silverado 1500. The cap has strong spring retention holding the cover closed firmly when not in use. This does not feel cheep nor does it seem like its going to break. All you have to do to get this swapped out is look at your plug face on the truck and find the 2 detentes (plastic retainers) that should be visible from the bumper and twist the outlet from the back and the plug should come right out. Remove the plug from the back swap out the plug and reverse the operation. Done and done. No need for any re wiring or messing around with wiring a different style plug into the truck.I would defiantly recommend this if you need to replace the outlet.
B001O0AMZS|5|Perfect fit looks great on my lexus sc300 with bbs lm 18's
B0044B7FG8|5|They look so great on my '07 cobalt and makes my car look new.  Packaged exceptionally well and my brother complimented me on them.  That is the ultimate compliment because he is very particular about his car and keeps it in meticulous condition.  Great buy and free shipping too!
B00Q7FCJ1A|5|items were as described, haven't used them yet, but they look and feel like they are going to be just fine
B00I0YORDY|4|Very good
B001TCXOTW|4|perfect
B00DZRTLFA|5|My great grandson loves it. Fit is good and it it very well made. Built strong to provide as much safety for him as you can get.
B000JFNAMQ|4|Arrived on time and intact. I used it to charge the AC on a car and the resolution was excellent for that purpose and the display stays on until you turn it off. It would be nice if the cord was about a foot longer.
B001927PS8|5|Came perfect and fit my car perfect!!
B00W2NMO3Y|5|GREAT TOOL FOR JACK
B001EP0GOK|5|perfect fit and included all the necessary items for install.
B007Y3BKNC|5|great
B004I0YU6S|3|Good quality product, took forever to arrive though.
B001KO6D5Q|5|great
B00AWPHAD8|5|Fits just right in my S3 hull glovebox on a GT-155 '15. Love the detachable carry case for wallet, cell, keys etc.
B00498DSM6|5|This was exactly what I needed for my car - it was priced perfectly and arrived quickly for me to replace the belt before it broke.
B000M5Y720|5|work great
B00GG9FI8I|2|I bought this because of the no rinse wash solution is amazing but I don't have good experience with wax, it leaves water mark behind... unlike the pervious wax that I had...  I guess I will just use this to wax the tires...
B00GFPR46W|4|WARNING: If you want your car to be quiet this is not the device for you. Any of these high-flow air intakes do their job by not impeding airflow from the airbox into the throttle body. That means that you can hear engine noise going the other direction. It's a fact of life, so if engine noise is a problem then take a pass on this or any other intake.<br /><br />Tough to tell if the performance boost is real or imaginary, but the car definitely sounds throatier now and it *seems* like I can take those left turns into oncoming traffic a little better. I'm usually not driving the car all that hard, but I installed it just about as soon as I purchased the car so I'm not sure if there's a fuel economy boost - but more horsepower is usually measured either in increased performance *or* increased fuel economy, so I'd guess this will help with fuel consumption.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze, though the step about reinstalling the front air scoop is a very small notation at the end of one of the steps.<br /><br />The filter has a finite life, unlike most wet filters (like K&N, etc.) but you can prolong the life considerably by pre-filtering a lot of the road gunk with the Hydro-Shield as an addon.
B00CIV01LM|5|The best!  Great fit, thick quilted material.  Fast great service.  Made our truck new again.
B00A7WJ38G|1|The ad said this would fit a 2012 Hyundai Sonata. I have a 2012 Hyundai Sonata, and found that it was too large for it. We bent it up trying to make it fit, making it not returnable. The problem may be that mine is a hybrid car. However, the ad did not say that that would make a difference.
B000C2GFOG|5|Worked as expected on an 02 Escape 3.0  Here is what's included:<br /><br />6 Upper manifold gaskets - commonly used for spark plug/coilpack change<br />6 Lower manifold gaskets - recommendation to also replace.  This only takes an additional 30 minutes and will fix potential issues (youtube for diy)<br />1 throttle body gasket - recommended as you should clean out your throttle body<br />2 IAC gasket - recommended as well, you should clean out your IAC
B006C1NBMA|1|Didnt work for the car i ordered it for  couldn't use th is
B00D8KJ8AM|5|Fit, form and function, the real thing from BMW. Exactly as advertised.
B000IYMNL2|5|Great price ! Raybestos is quality name brand.
B002OAQDBE|5|Fit exactly with my Class C motorhome. Just havre to cut 4&#34; long.
B00PHZU62A|1|Pretty much a piece of junk. Too small for the windshield it was supposed to fit. It was flimsy, wouldn't stay against the wind shield, and the suction cups were worthless. Although it was a pretty blue. Save your money and buy one a little more expensive.
B00PF0HIDM|5|Awesome lights, I'm so in love with my new lights! So much better than stock halogens and way better light coverage. Although 1 thing I found disappointing was there is little to no difference between the high and low beam. The low beam is bright already but very little when high beam is turned on I expected 2000 lumens brighter but oh well. Also the back is alittle big so putting it in could be alittle rough but once you get it in they will not disappoint you! Highly recommend these lights!!!!
B000N321MO|5|This tool looks really professional I even test it but I like it
B006R0XYGY|5|Excellent product
B006TOLWLM|5|Looks very good. Goes on easily. Seems durable.
B0002SRF4O|5|Changing out spark plugs on my 2001 Honda civic got to number 3 cylinder on it started to get super thight and you could feel the threads starting to strip I thightened it back in so I could still drive it until I had the money to fix ( time sert kits are expensive over $200 for the kit) then I found this kit ordered it and worked great only took about an hour with a few beers while doing the job. Hahaha. Just loaded the tap with grease to catch some of the shavings and used a price of metal tubing ducted taped to a shop vac hose to get the rest out of the cylinder head. Also I taped the 3/8 socket extension to the tap to make sure they wouldn't seperate while taping the new threads. Worked great no drilling needed with the extra tapered  tap. It's been 4 months with no problems
B0001MQ7E0|5|This is a great addition to our road trips
B00N3404I8|3|Poor design but great upgrade. If you get a great deal but it, if not then buy another brand. The front lines a slightly better.
B0057ZQJ12|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B000NSATSM|4|Easy to take out and install without any tools; the basic redeeming feature of this design. Like the original, it's made entirely of plastic which of course is the way almost everything is made nowadays. The reason I had to buy a replacement is because it is glued together in 3 pieces and the outermost piece, the dark cover, popped off. Not a very robust design considering that it goes on the back of a pickup truck bumper but that's what you get these days of low quality and cheaply made/designed parts.
B00HJDY6PG|5|Fits perfectly
B00HZPXVG8|3|My spare &#34;donut for my 2006 Hyundai Sonata fits my 2014 Forte perfectly.  Glad I tried before I bought one
B000CF3VVS|5|Worked well to clear my error code.  Sold my avalanche shortly after the install so I cannot attest to the longevity of the O2 Sensor.  To install I sprayed some PB blaster for a day prior to install every 4-5 hours and soaked it the morning of.  I borrowed/rented a the O2 socket kit from a local auto parts store, returned it and got my $25.00 back.  It came off really quite hard on my 2005 Chevrolet Avalanche with 5.3, the expletives were flying there for a sec but once it broke loose everything went together pretty easy.  This new sensor was a bit longer than the one I took off so I had to use the clawfoot tool to get the new one snug.  I would recommend it you are having an error code or idle issues, worked really well for the short time after I had installed (2 months)
B00Q0TIGSS|5|Great lights!!!!!<br />Easy to install. The headlamp sticks out just a bit but I corrected that issue by purchasing an extra large headlamp bezel. Looks great and the night time illumination is AWESOME.  Highly recommend these lamps!!!
B007C4DTOG|5|Great price and super fast delivery, overall great service, very please. Will tell friends and family
B00CH4GYQG|5|Put it in and pushed the pedal and it took off. Very happy with my purchase.
B003T1SUUY|5|Good quality product complete with hardware and instructions, well packed, shipped promptly with tracking information. Thank you very much.
B0048FEL7G|5|A LITTLE BIT ON THE FLIMSY SIDE - MATERIAL SHOULD HAVE MORE SUBSTANCE W/A TACKY TYPE ON BOTTOM, OTHER THAN THAT IT LOOKS GREAT!!!
B006VN3GHY|5|customer loved it fast shipping great product thank you
B006X8AVG6|5|great piece worked great
B005DUMADC|5|Needed to hook my Noco up to the battery tender pigtail that came on my Polaris Ranger. Works as expected.
B004RUH5CA|5|I just put this on my '03 Jeep Wrangler X with the 4.0L engine.  It sounds VERY good.  There is a popular youtube video on a Jeep Wrangler advertising itself as &#34;best jeep muffler sound&#34; or something similar thereto.  I bought based on that video, and I am not disappointed.  By the way, this is not a direct fit to the Wrangler.  The Wrangler has a center in/offset out stock muffler whereas this is obviously center/center.  Therefore, it will take some minor fabrication by a muffler technician to get it on the Jeep.  As long as they know what they are doing, it should not be an issue.  I paid $90 to have it installed.  Also note that Amazon says it does not fit the Wrangler.  From their point of view, that is correct.  But, as I experienced, it can go on with some additional installation work.  The real area of interest is in the sound level.  How loud your muffler is and how loud you want it to be is extremely subjective.  I will try to quantify it: On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the stock muffler and 10 being no muffler (i.e. open headers), I would rate this muffler at a 7.  It's pretty loud, but not too loud for me.  It does drone a bit at highway speeds, but not so much that you can't hold a conversation or hear the radio.  I previously had the Magnaflow 12256 universal fit muffler that was recommended to me personally by a rep at magnaflow.  On my loudness scale, I would rate that muffler at about 3.  It just wasn't loud enough for what I was looking for, even though it may be perfect for someone else's tastes.  As I said, it is highly subjective.  I cannot comment on the longevity of this product as I put it on about a week ago.  But Magnaflow has an outstanding reputation, and I have confidence in its quality.  Overall, highly recommended if it falls into your sound level sweet spot.
B002R1FICK|4|fit fine
B00RIIINO2|4|Just what I needed.
B00GD2BZL2|5|ok
B003AVSBOI|5|Excellent
B000P656SA|5|Worked how it was suppose to, and had no complaints.
B00HZX4TQ6|5|Perfect fit - VERY bright. The LED modules are directional so definitely try the light before reinstalling the lens in case you have to flip it around.
B0040DX7EO|3|Bought this mirror for my husbands 06 Chevy Silverado truck. Although the mirror itself works perfectly fine, I don't care for the mounting bracket on it.  It has two tabs that extend on the top. My husbands truck has indicators on the bottom of the mirror, so there is no way for you to center the mirror over the existing mirror. It has to sit on the bottom end, obstructing the indicators, and leaving the stock mirror visible behind the Broadway mirror. Just something to consider.
B0009RYBMW|5|Fit great Fast Shipping!
B0049LWJ1O|5|Great product
B00NQ198LC|5|Works as advertised. Easy install, fit perfectly, locked and stayed secure. No problems and would recommend this to others.
B0016IDV9M|5|Great product, easy install. It works great.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Great product for the money super bright only used a few times but not a single problem yet
B004AYZB38|2|Left an orange dusting on my plugs, didn't help detonation at all.  Wasn't worth it, to me.
B001EOV3JS|5|Easy to install? Omg.. I can't see anything possibly simpler. It was more difficult finding a good spot to zip tie the end somewhere, than to install this thing. I'm glad someone came up with something so simple to install, plus, WORK correctly. This installed in 10 minutes in a 2015 Toyota Tacoma, 8 minutes were spent running the wires / zip ties. lol... Awesome!
B000GU3RPO|5|fairly inexpensive, bright, good color simple instalation and helps lower current draw, whats not to like
B001O03MBO|5|Got fast, just as listed.
B00MP6ICCU|5|Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
B00KVLYJ50|5|Remote key works well and is easy to program if you have 2 other working keys.
B00S5R56B8|4|Works great and even gave pending codes. Easy to use, would buy it again without any hesitation.
B001QR3VIY|3|The quality of the vinyl material is good. They are not difficult to apply if you take your time; they will go on straight and you can avoid air bubbles by working from one side to the other. The horizontal bars in the &#34;R&#34; and &#34;A&#34; are MUCH thinner than the molded impression in the bumper. As mentioned by someone else, the die-cut for the &#34;R&#34; is also off just a little, and does not accurately following the molded letter.
B00W7A0ED4|5|This one fit my 2015 X5 (F15) perfectly.  It was well packaged and delivered quicker than estimate.  The 3M tape on the underside works extremely well.  You would need to be careful putting this guard on the car as it would stick to the car immediately.
B009EQDOPY|5|Excellent product. It's similar to Mother's Back to Black in its intended purpose, but TRV is silicone free and less susceptible to spotting from water and other car care products. The door/window seals on my 1999 Porsche are original and they looked it. They were greyed and becoming hard. TRV not only turned them black again, but it also made them nice and soft. This product also claims to have UV protectants, which is important to me as I deal with the intense Texan sun.
B0075IOFGK|4|wish it would have come with instructions on how to apply the sticker
B00AN2L0TU|5|easy to install with included instructions and manufacturers you tube video. had it in in 20 min flat. looks good and works well.
B00BITKD2W|5|Fits just like original
B00GBQYTKY|5|Worked great and was much less than the $310 at the dealer
B00JK2WK9I|5|Good Trade
B000VKTUD2|5|Simple installation.
B00NEL6YXO|5|As expected as usual.
B00ZUR5JEK|5|This clever little product is super handy and accurate.
B0077PZEB6|3|I recived the starter very fast,,2 days, it fit and worked great. the reason I had to give a 3 star rating was I thought I was buying a NEW  starter  !! it was a remanufactured starter.i failed to see any where in the description where it stated it was a remanufactured.
B007GR54FQ|3|kind of like black shoe polish
B000IY6RZU|5|I purchased this for an aging 1998 Jetta Wolfsburg that was not worth the trouble of a costly new AC compressor.  The clutch had failed and bearing froze up.  The Dorman is a strong robust build with a plastic pulley and sealed bearing similar to the serpentine belt tensioner.  From reading other reviews I was anticipating a possible alignment issue and additional hardware.  The unit does not ship with hardware and the bolts which secure the AC compressor are not long enough to adapt to the bypass unit.  I was able to purchase two heavy duty metric bolts with nuts and washers at a local hardware store, and due to the length, ended up mounting one bolt in the opposite direction.  The bypass pulley aligned perfectly, and the new hardware was clear from getting in the way of belts.  Serpentine belt went back on over the pulley perfectly and car runs great.  Difficulty of  installation was mostly removing the alternator (it was tight on it's mount) and there is the the hassle of recapturing the R134 into a storage container since it can not be released into the atmosphere.  A local auto tech can do it cheaply. Once the compressor is discharged it is merely two bolts holding it on, and an 8mm hex head holding the AC lines.  Took less then 1 hour.
B00UW4DLJ6|4|My second one. Excellent quality. I do wish that it had more power for jump starting larger engines, otherwise it gets top marks from me.
B00VR79KBA|5|Nice lights for a different look
B0067UF9R6|5|Replaced the drums on my 2006 Civic LX 4-door sedan. Direct fit. I've been driving on them for a year now with no problems. I had to send back a few other drums because they weren't the right size. Fear not: this one is.
B00V6XM260|4|I love these door edger they stay on well.
B00PRCN1CK|5|Very informative.
B00L9ICXEI|5|We absolutely love the sticker. Adds a distinctive look to our humble JK sport. Easy to spot in a crowd of jeeps (HA!). Easy to install. Had no problems any step in the process. We went the wet route in application and found that it worked best for us.
B005C4MHZK|4|Fit nicely and offered the right amount of support for a light shoulder strain.  I was able to wear it under a dress shirt if I removed the additions bracing.
B000EBICHI|1|Returned this due to poor quality, poor padding, just not a great product for any price. A folded up towel works better than this cushion.
B00EUUNJRM|5|Great price !!!
B00JVRZB1G|5|Perfect fit and they work fantastically. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00EKCZKVI|5|Worked just fine. Had to shim up the original key blade a bit so it didn't wiggle. Don't forget to transfer the chip attached inside the old case or the car won't start!
B00RA41UD0|5|a++++++
B00W2B50GE|1|This does not fit a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado....says it does but it does not!
B00GZHR3J8|3|I purchased these about a month ago for my 2009 Scion TC. Installing them was fairly quick and easy, the sleeves just wrap around the seat belt. They look great and cushion the seat belt well so you don't get irritated skin from the belt. However, there are a some downsides. I began to notice that the stitching was coming off. There are bits of loose thread, not a big problem. Also, when you want to exit the car, you have to pull the sleeve all the way down to the seat belt can go back into place and not hang around. Overall, this was a great purchase and it'll make your car look awesome!
B008XIQ5KA|3|Okay set. The problem is that the tools do not come with their own pouch for easy carry. Additionally, the protective foam makes it a bit difficult removing any one of the tools when needed.
B000C9RRA0|5|good price works good
B000E28CKY|1|I hate it because it does not fit on my 2013 690  Duke I went to change oil , ( the other filter # kn 155 fit ) When I went to change the right side (kn 157 ) it was not the same , it didn't have a hole all the way through like the original equipt. filter. I had to put that old filter back  in the bike . Not pleased w/ this purchase . This filter was recommended by Power sports Performance.<br /><br />JOE
B00GJLYMW6|3|I did a lot of research before buying a bike rack for the hitch of my '04 Envoy and picked this one for price and ease of use.<br /><br />I only gave it 3 stars because I did have to modify it a bit as it was too tall for me to get bikes on/off without being on tiptoe or on a curb (I am a 5'5&#34; woman).  About 6 inches was removed from the pole going into the hitch.  The bikes are still safely being carried but I don't have to worry about injuring myself trying to load/unload the bikes.<br /><br />Right now I only use it for two bikes but like the fact that I can add on a piece to carry 3 or 4 at a time if needed.
B00NFSNAS8|5|WORKS VERY GOOD  THANK YOU
B00873J0YY|5|I have only used them twice now, but they are easy to put on the racks, and easy to use. Not much different from the more expensive ones and works just as well i I have only used them twice now, but they are easy to put on the racks, and easy to use. Not much different from the more expensive ones and works just as well.
B000C41HD8|1|I got this to proactively replace the leaking power steering pump on a Chevy 350.  I installed it last weekend well after the 30 day return for Amazon.  After installing the pump it made a loud high pitched noise.  (No not like a lose drive belt)  Now I am stuck with a bad pump.
B001FMCEWO|5|only 1 word (perfect)
B00S4OWN6S|5|Wonderful product.  Use them all the time.
B00C5W411A|3|This is a well made product, and priced appropriately for what you get. It looks amazing on my 2010 A4, and by amazing it looks exactly like the factory HID lights, which is the look I was going for. That being said, the product description is woefully lacking, and there are several things not mentioned that you absolutely have to know before buying.<br /><br />This product is the headlight assembly ONLY, as defined by the Audi parts guide. You will need several other parts for this to work, one of which is only available aftermarket (Assuming you are upgrading a B8 model A4 from stock halogen to HID). They are as follows:<br /><br />1. Xenon Headlight Adapter Cable Harness  &#62;&#62; This is an aftermarket only part, and will run you between $50 -$60 for a set of two. You need this to hook your existing cable into this headlight<br />2. Headlight HID Ballast part # 8K0 941 597  &#62;&#62; This is an OEM part, but not technically a piece of the headlight &#34;assembly&#34;. You'll need one for each headlight, and used on ebay I paid $80 each. New they're around $250. There are no aftermarket options.<br />3. Headlight Control module part # 8K0 907 472 &#62;&#62; This is also an OEM part that isn't technically part of the assembly. Again, you'll need one for each headlight, and used on ebay I paid $90 each. New they're about $250 also, and no aftermarket options.<br /><br />Also remember that this does NOT come with the HID bulb ($100 for a pair of good ones, $50 for cheap ones), but does have all the other bulbs.<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you decided to buy these lights and are hooked by the seemingly low price that they're advertised for, be aware that you'll be spending about $250 extra (for each light) to actually get them to work. You'll basically end up spending about $1,000 to replace both lights.<br /><br />Anyway, once you have all these parts, installation is pretty simple, and I didn't throw any codes, so that was nice.
B00WDSVEE8|1|unfortunately the optics are distorted on these &#34;inexpensive&#34; sunglass clip on and give unclear vision when used. I have gone back to the Amazon site to try and find optically correct clip on lens but I can only find &#34;cheap&#34; lens from China!!!  where are the optically clear lenses that do not distort your vision?????
B0002NYBVO|5|Great product!
B010VUZDC8|4|I like this frame, although I wish the rhinestones were more secure.  I am afraid they will peel off when I wash my car.  Overall, its's a good price and you get what you pay for.
B0031B1YWI|5|OEM replacement. Perfect fit for a 2011 F150.
B002P31OG4|4|It's just like the one I replaced except it isn't brass all the way through like the old one.  It only has the brass hose adapter on the outside.  The backside is plastic. Hence the reason for the 4 stars.  Installed easily.
B005JPJNO0|1|These do not work worth a darn. Using with McGuirs cutting compound 49 and they gum up quickly and do not cut oxidation as advertised. Started to use orange cutting pads and had much better luck.
B006RLGHMQ|5|Fit and finish were good. Snapped right in, no problems.
B001JDE6ZW|2|If you're prone to seizures, do like over two miles an hour with these one...they shake when the car is just idling. Yes I am in compliance with the law but hard to use.
B000COCA34|5|Definitely top of the line fender flares. These look awesome on my 98 Silverado. They are sturdy, and they keep the mud away from my windows when off-roading. They get the job done, and look good at the same time.  Easy to install, highly recommended. You get what you pay for!!
B000B8U61O|5|worked
B002U6ELS4|5|I was very impressed of the quality if this product. The powder coating withstands brake cleaner. Perfect OE replacement!
B008GFKY1Q|3|It is as expected
B012C5FOLK|1|BEWARE! It does a have a fiberglass blend. I had fiberglass shards all over my hands and clothes. In this case, it probably would've been best to spend the extra money and go with DEI and get their true titanium wrap with no fiberglass blended into it.
B00NIB9G58|5|I mounted 2 of these on my golf cart that I have converted into a hunting buggy. They absolutely light your world up down in the trails at night. I have them running off of a separate 12v deep cycle battery and it has lasted me several hours without any dimming from the battery drain. They are very tough and durable. These lights are heavy indicating a good, solid build too me. They have been rained on also with no negative effects. The casings do get pretty warm but they have a lot of heat sink built into/on them. A couple of the guys at the hunt club that have been on my cart at night can't believe how much the woods are lit up.<br /><br />I thought they were pricey from the get go but now understand that you are getting what you pay for. A good, tough, andhigh quality light that delivers for you.
B00K8SGEDG|3|ok
B003O95I3S|5|I had originally bought 20&#34; and 22&#34; Bosch Icon Beam Wipers but they did not fit on my Shelby even tho Amazon stated they did. However these Bosch Evolution blades do fit even tho Amazon states they dont!
B00LEBLI82|5|Amazing how much cooler these lights burn.  Those nights when the A/C is not really needed, but normal 12v bulbs create too much heat.  These make a wonderful difference.  We also like the light quality, not so intense, but plenty of light.
B00QVTC4MQ|5|These are near eighty bucks locally. Found it on Amazon for less than twenty. Works good. A little hard to install as it is at the rear of the engine behind the intake manifold. Code reset itself and turned the light out.
B00N4JBLF2|4|The seat cover fit great. But the elastic straps on the arm rest need to be sewn shorter because they are not helping to hold the arm rest covers on but they do stay on well enough because they are made to fit so well. So all in all I am more then pleased with these covers and the colors make the  machine pop more than the grey seat on a orange machine. would tell anyone looking for a very good cover to buy these ones for sure.
B00NHUN41C|5|thank you
B00REJXRY6|5|Very simple to install. Drove cross country with zero problems.
B00U36K3SA|5|Would buy again
B00DM8NH02|5|Fits perfect and looks great!
B00INBV0KM|5|I just got these and I drove a diesel with a 4&#34; lift and over sized tires and these work great. The extra length makes it not nearly as steep as my father's ramps I used to borrow. The wields are great, great quality and the straps to secure the ramps are a great design and functional. For the price these cannot be beat in my opinion. I did a lot of research and comparing and you will not be disappointed. For the total length and strength, these are great. I love also that they fold up which saves a lot of space in the truck
B00VF0OSFC|5|works as advertised.
B00OPVYHZ4|4|works good but the light on it does not work
B00FZRVG1A|5|I am a weekend detailer and this is an excellent polish that I use on peoples car. Two of the best properties of this polish are the following,<br />1 long lasting and great protection during winter<br />2 extremely deep shine on dark colored cars/trucks<br /><br />This is an excellent polish and would recommend this over all of the others that you can buy from your local parts store....<br />Love this product.....
B00T2RZ7RI|5|Pnoy pride! Perfect decal on my truck!
B002UX7I9G|5|Overall happy with these bulbs. Nice white light with a bit of a blue tint. Never had one burn out but seemed to lose some intensity after about 18 months, which is normal and acceptable in my opinion.
B009FU6U82|5|Great product and fast shipping!a+++
B000FJQWD0|5|These turned out great, took me a little while to get around to putting them in, was a little intimidated by the clamp system to hold them on but once you do one its really simple. Put them on a 2006 Scion xB, they fit right in with the interior. Clamped them right over the stock rubber pads and they don't move around at all. Just be sure to set the gas pedal and clutch a little high, if not then you might not be able to fully press them to the floor. Guess now I need some new floor mats!
B000CKSX5C|5|Good product
B004Y0MYLU|5|More than I expected. These are very good ramps for loading mowers and atv's  on to low boy trailers. Great product!
B00KXC44EI|5|Bought these for every vehicle we have ever owned...best in the winter months
B00GJKXW8M|5|Great lights for our farm equipment
B00IR90FG0|1|Look good but very hard to adjust show black spots on the road when driving.
B00GZR4N0K|5|Good
B00ISLG8KY|5|Easy to install and looks fine.
B003YLIGNK|5|I have all speeds now not just hurricane in my 01 sierra
B00PJPHEBO|5|Bought this as a nice tool to have on hand should I need it, and when paired with the Torque Android app, it is a very powerful device. No problem syncing my bluetooth with it, I was happy to see that even when it is actively interfacing with my phone's (S5) bluetooth, it pairs in the background and allows you to still use your bluetooth for other things. Came in very minimal packaging (A 1.5x1.5x2 box inside a standard small Amazon box). No instructions with it, just a small little non-retail package, but if you've ever paired something with a phone, it's simple. It uses 1234 as a password for bluetooth by the way.
B0009JKI86|5|Well worth it and a good idea to have as spares
B00COTJQVE|5|Easy install. Good fit. Works great.
B00BULZKSU|5|PERFECT FIT, EASY TO INSTALL, LOOKS GREAT ON MY 08 RDX, AWESOME PRICE!!! ULTRA FAST SHIPPING, ALWAYS GO AMAZON, IF IT'S WRONG THEY WILL MAKE IT RIGHT 100% OF THE TIME!
B008ET2Y7Q|5|Great
B000IG1SDY|5|it I an economy spinner with no fancy artwork but it is fully functional with  good bearing support which makes it spin freely under pressure.
B000BZ968Q|5|Exact fit for my 2002 F250 Super Duty. Changed it out in the driveway in an hour and a half. Get yourself a high quality snap ring pliers to remove the old hub, as the snap ring under the lockouts is extremely stiff. Timken is pure quality do not go cheap on bearings.
B009PTTQSE|5|The product fits perfectly, works as promised and it was easy to install.
B00GAXXSEQ|5|They're Great!!!!!!
B004K8YK72|5|Fits perfect and just snaps in. No screws and it stays in place. 80 on freeway and it stays put.
B0085FOPC6|4|Look great and easy to install. Had an issue where the voltage regulator on driver side burned up and lost LED'S. But they sent me a replacement immediately. Don't know if this is a common problem. Other than that I'm happy with them.
B000ZRW78Q|5|I bought it for locking and unlocking my 92 pickup doors. Sadly I didn't know that this is only a constant on or constant off switch, not an impulse switch. If you are thinking of using it for your doors as I did this is not for you. If you want to turn on lights or something else and keep them on than then this will work for you. I gave it five stars because it does work fine, just not for what I need.
B00LDNQZES|1|Trash, had to pay additional for program, battery...uggggh.
B002P8SM32|5|This product was PERFECT !!!!!<br />Thanks a ton 😊😊😊
B00QI7J5C8|4|Awesome product far cheaper than dealer stock, installed in a 2015 Nissan Pathfinder would have given it 5 stars but it didn't come with hooks to attach to the floor. I had to order hooks on Amazon to attach if you do not want to screw into the floor of your new car.
B001UFRNKY|1|The only reason I'm giving the OBX Race Type Header a one star rating is because, under  acceleration the collecter end of the header hits/vibrates against the steering rack. It's very disappointing.
B005Z8HAUK|4|I have no problems with this inflator. It takes 10 minutes to fill my 8-gallon portable carry tank...  Is that a problem with this unit?  Of course not.  I was just hoping for faster performance.  Now for the rest of the story.<br /><br />I operate a professional tractor business (brush hogging, dirt work, backhoe, etc) and often find myself in remote areas without access to services. One of my contingencies is being able to repair flats.  I an 8-gallon portable carry tank to deliver blasts of air - partially seat a tire bead, blow dust/debris out of the tractor's radiator (my #1 use), etc. Obviously I then use the Slime 12v inflator to charge up the portable air tank. It takes 10 minutes to get the tank to 120psi.  10 minutes happens to be the max duty cycle time.  The unit has only over-heated one time and of course then it just shuts off and you are supposed to wait 20 minutes or so before trying again.  In the Oklahoma summer it gets HOT so I'm surprised it's only overheated one time, honestly.<br /><br />The carrying case is quite nice - very sturdy with good latches.  The hose is long and pliable as are the leads to the battery. I doubt I'll ever use the built-in flashlight but it's there and it works. The carry handle on the unit is very solid. The pressure gauge seems to agree within reason to the gauge on the portable air tank. I really wish it had a shut-off for determining when the max pressure is reached.  I'd like to be able to walk away from the unit while it's charging up my portable tank so that I could keep working while it's filling.  Maybe I need to find a 12V timer to wire between the truck battery and this unit!?
B00G9WA0C6|1|Bought this item for a long weekend trip.  When packing the bag, attempted to attach a barrel bag to the top with some lightweight toiletry items and the grommet attaching the strap to the top of the bag popped out so couldnt attach the bag as advertised and had to condense items so they would fit in the bag.  One hour into the trip and a strap broke (threads sewn to attach strap broke) and almost lost the bag going own the road on my bike.  Had to stop and buy a strap to keep the bag on for the remainder of the trip.  Feel this bag for the price is a bad product and I would have expected it to be a little more durable than it was.  If not for this, it would have been a great bag as the size and all of the outside storage pockets were great. Rainfly does work well however the bag not so much.
B00YJL81HK|5|Product just as described!! Installed easy, highly recommend !!!
B009WQ3K7I|5|These are definitely a step up from the Weathertechs.  They are made of a heavier and more pliable material which adds to the fit very well.  I never liked that the weathertechs seemed to float a bit above the carpet and we're kind of uncomfortable on long drives.  The X-acts offer some cushion for you feet.  Precision fit on these is terrific and the grooves hold debris that would otherwise migrate under the seat.  The material is sort of a silicon feel which helps keep them clean.  I've had black liners before which just looked filthy after a while.  These are black but still look brand new.  I only bought the front pair for a 2015 Ford F-350 Lariat.
B006MX8196|3|back seat doesn't fit
B0033DJ4LC|5|Very complete kit. All parts are good quality. Gates are known as belt people but this kit expands that view. Price is also lower than most &#34;name brand&#34; kits.
B00PWXL8B0|3|There is one flaw with this design. The freedom tops do not fit.  I had to fabricate new mounting tabs for the 2 floor mounts. Once I did this this item was perfect and now fits the freedom tops that everyone has.  Seems like this could of been a lil more thought out. Clearly this designer does not own a jeep wrangler and doesn't realize that everyone needs to store there tops with in the jeep in case it rains.  Also there is 2 more inches available in between the rear seats and the enclosure on the unlimited.  They should change this design immediately to accommodate the freedom tops.
B00230P8J8|5|These 'Chris Products' lenses are by far the best quality on the market.  I think they may even exceed the OEM Harley factory lenses by a small margin.  Very thick plastic, sturdy, and scratch resistant.  And the price is almost too good to be true.  I often see them for under $2 a piece.  Great lenses. Also really like the quality of their taillight lenses, just wish they made them in Smoke Tint.
B001B5E33S|5|Nice kit, it came with everything I needed! clutch feels smooth and grips well
B00SYVX2OI|5|Had to do a small amount of work to get it to fit properly
B00BYNJALM|5|Fit my F350 perfectly!
B00029WVI8|5|I put this on my Dad's 2012 Kia Sante Fe it works great for him.  It looks nice too!
B001IZKDZS|1|I purchased the Camco 45761 8' - 10' cover for my 8' Jayco popup.  The cover was plenty big enough to hook to the front of the A-frame, which is nice because it covers the battery box and propane hookup.  My camper has been getting beat up by the Arizona sun so I wanted a cover to help reduce the rate of deterioration.  It seemed like this would be OK for the job.<br /><br />As long as it is not disturbed, everything is fine.  The straps held on in some pretty good monsoon winds, and kept everything pretty dry in the rain.  So last weekend I took the cover off, folded it up and put it aside so I could take the camper out for a few days.  When I got back and put the cover back on, I found a large tear on the top of the cover.<br /><br />When I took the cover off, and then put it back on, I didn't feel any resistance or anything that would indicate the material was hung up, and if it was going to tear, I would have expected the corners around the bumpers to be shredded first.  But this tear happened in a place where nothing can catch, and unfortunately it is now no longer rain proof.  The cover is only 2 months old at this point.<br /><br />The polypropylene material itself is an odd, almost paperish like material that at first seems like it can be durable, but obviously for me it has seriously failed that test.  Since the camper is pretty old already, I'm not going to bother with another one - I'm just going to duct tape the rip and hope for the best for a couple of years.  If I had a newer camper, I would definitely look into a heavier duty cover, maybe made from a canvas like material instead of this stuff.  It would be pretty expensive, heavy and unwieldy in comparison, but it would last longer than this one did.<br /><br />Interestingly, I just saw another review that has a picture of the same exact tear as mine.  Perhaps there is a bad batch or a design defect in the product.  Whatever the case, I'm not happy with the product.  Good concept, good fit, but scoresa zero on durability.<br /><br />* Update - within a day of writing the review, we had a bit of rain and wind and the cover tore the rest of the entire length, front to back as shown in the last picture.<br /><br />* Update 2 - After the tear opened up, I called Camco for warranty service.  They stated that Camco has an agreement with Amazon to provide warranty service under the same terms and gave me the number for Amazon customer service.  I called Amazon and explained the situation, at which point they said they would take the item back for refund even though it was outside the 30 day return window.  When the refund was processed however, they had charged a restocking fee of $18.  I wrote an email back insisting this was not acceptable - I would have made the warranty claim with Camco if I knew they were going to charge me for returning a defective product.  Finally, Amazon agreed to refund the full amount.  Buyer beware.  Always.  Reducing from 2 to 1 star because of the hassle.
B00O9RNUSO|5|Wow, these lights put out a great amount of light and stay cool, they were just what we needed for our RV.
B000BQSKA0|1|More Chinese Junk! Purchased this can at Home Depot and after filling it with fuel I could not get it to operate when I got to the car. Spilled fuel everywhere etc. Got on the website and watched the You Tube video..... Another 10 mins wasted. I finally took apart the so called &#34;safety device&#34; and now the fuel flows freely without spills or any drips. I would never buy another product from this company and would urge people to find a garage sale or flea market and pick up an old fashioned designed can cause these new ones suck! The masterminds should stop trying to mass produce in China and design something an American can operate. Fire your designers today!
B00801RJFU|5|works great
B00684TAYY|5|This is a great quality keyless entry. It even came with a battery so it was ready to go out of the package!! The price was the best part, I've been quoted $50+ from dealerships so this seller and product blow it out of the water! The seller even included the instructions for programming my specific car, that was a life saver bc I didn't know how to do it and would have had to research it myself. A++ BestKeys is the best!
B000CAVE1W|5|Quick ship, good quality - been on the car for a couple of weeks with no problems
B001DRLPIK|5|Great filter, what more can I say. Delivery was excellent as was the price.
B0044AZ4BC|5|Great filter and price.
B0041U3LIS|5|Got the tail light assembly in just 3 days.  It took me 20 mins. to install with no modifications whatsoever.  Very happy with the result.
B00D3298A0|4|Great quality, fits my Car well, prevent dirt or mud to stain your baby car mat. Does what it's expected to!
B00VT02ZEE|3|So after all my efforts to get this delivered - and I will say they shipped quickly. The issue was they had set it for signature release. It was quite some effort to get that changed - UPS would not leave it and it was 1 try before going back. But I got them in any case.<br />So for the mirrors - I put them on a 2000 F350 - replacing the originals. I had to remove a piece of plastic from the mirror that my truck does not have a hole for. After I snapped that off they went right on.  Now - these are big.  Huge. The blind spot mirror is bigger than my whole car side mirrors.<br />But the look good after you get use to the change. The blind spot mirrors are very nice and cover a lot of area. One of the mirrors - pass side is not as flat and have a bit of a wavy look. Not unusable but still noticeable as some had mentioned. The driver side seems better.<br />Lots of rear view coverage though.  If the mirrors were flatter - probably bump it up a star and if I had not had to screw around with shipping so many hours - would get close to 5.
B002UJVNFA|4|Value is outstanding for 3 pair
B002MEWQNG|5|Ok so I have owned these for about a year now. They are great! They haven't yellowed or faded or let moisture in or anything. They look exactly like OEM, dont let the word &#34;chrome&#34; scare you. The lightbulbs they come with are *ok* I plan to replace mine with philips crystalvision bulbs soon.<br /><br />They seem to be built to a lower quality standard than OEM however. But being these are only $60 at the time of this review, if they last 2 years(and it seems like they will easily) I am totally happy!<br /><br />If you have yellowed/faded headlights or broken housings these are a perfect replacement. Headlight restoration only works for 6 months or so. This will solve the problem completely.
B00HJCJE04|5|Bought both front and rear.  Front uses existing fasteners on truck and went on very easily and tightly.  Rear uses a clamp system which was a bit more complicated.  You need to look from underneath to make sure the clamps are horizontal so they clamp onto the fender well edge.  Both front and rear fit well and seem secure.  I expect them to stay on and last.  Good product.  No drilling needed.
B00A9MO2XK|1|This DOES NOT WORK FOR THE HONDA FIT 2009!!!<br /><br />People have said that it would, and my mechanic said it is not true.<br /><br />Waste of my money...
B004WX16IQ|5|Having had two previous generations of this helmet I knew I would love it. My main reason for this model was price right now. I wanted the internal sunshade, but can live without it for what they are selling this for.
B00DL6T2YK|5|Quick, accurate readings that I use on the track, and you can't go wrong with Longacre for that purpose. Easily adjusted thumb-release valve to set your tires to almost exact requirements (even within the 1/2 pound range). Well built, very durable. This is quality equipment.
B005R4L3LO|3|These lights look fantastic very bright and much more modern look than standard taillights - the brake / running light (top light in picture) is an LED that has a plug which hooks up to the existing light socket - its plug and play, easy.  The bottom light is your current reverse bulb and socket, supposed to be able to just put your light bulb in and twist, but the cut out does NOT fit a 2004 Ford Explorer XLT - I am jury rigged something, wasnt a big deal.  There were no instructions in the box which seems like a miss, as some people probably ruin their product trying to shoe horn the reverse lights in the hole... product should more clearly state compatibility.  Edit on 9/2 - the LEDs on the right side of the right rear stopped working... reducing to 1 star pending the seller making this right - pics below; first one shows the left light, working as it should. 2nd is the right one, not working as it should.  9/9 - took one week but they sent me working taillights. Still look great, but still have issue with no instructions, poor fitting on reverse light.

B001G7KRHM|5|Both of my original brackets on my '94 Jaguar XJ-S were broken and I was in desperate need of replacements. These worked perfectly and were easy to install. Great price, as well.
B00II5YD4S|4|When washing the cars or windows this is a very helpful tool. It seems to be made of pretty solid material and is simple to use.<br /><br />Personally, I would recommend getting a larger size to cover more area. Seems like 11&#34; was a little short for me.
B00JIJ98PM|4|LED turn signals are working thanks to these. Remember to hook them up in parallel.

B001GJ3FIS|5|Really good nozzle and a good value.  Very pleased with the many choices of spray functions!
B000BKEBO0|4|It works.
B00IDFDW86|4|Would be perfect for keeping the inside of my SUV cool except for two things; so large that it's hard to roll up and place in the back seat; could have made the velcro strap longer; it will only work when the shade is rolled tight.
B0055DRMRQ|1|uncomfortable
B000ALG8LO|4|Works pretty good!
B000NPNXOW|5|Works great at signals.
B00E253ZQA|2|Created too much noise in the cabin of my car. Anyone want to buy it? I'll sell it and I made an adapter for the '06 Mazda 3, you have have that too.
B00JH05LQM|5|Perfect match.
B003YKTNOM|3|Product was damaged when arrived. Waiting for replacement
B00MQGFQRS|4|Good for the price fits good with a little play but looks nice and makes the car look better as well.made out of good material should last a while.
B000BUQOGI|5|Emergency TESLA charging
B000JL760C|5|I bought this to replace the fluid in my 2006 GTO.  I was racing autocross with it and was boiling the old fluid.  The SRF fixed that problem perfectly.  Shortly after ordering it I was watching the NASCAR race from Watkins Glen and Jeff Gordon's car was having brake issues.  I noticed that the crew was servicing the race car with this SRF fluid-- so if it's good enough to run in a NASCAR race car running on a road course, I'd say it's good enough for some weekend autocross!  It's also not as corrosive as other fluids.  I spilled a few drops inside my engine bay, and while it did lift some paint, it wasn't anywhere near as bad as other fluids I have used.  I also put it in my clutch system and seems to have smoothed out the clutch at high loads.
B0061R3MEM|5|In a word great!
B00KQH1DL2|1|This product was a pain. Firstly, they came VERY, VERY late. As seen in the description, these lights are powered by the 12V plug-ins in the car. I tried to set them up but the were very confusing. I had no clue where to put each light and they didn't reach where i wanted them to go. Lastly, they are not bright at all and after 15 minutes, two of the lights died. I would stay away from this product!
B00IKSRTBM|5|great deal
B00QGUK6SO|5|what a difference in breaking on my 97 talon . very nice
B00KFMHAH4|4|Just enough roof clearance for my F-250 crew cab. Very stable when mounted using an impact driver.
B00H3LF3CY|4|The parts arrived on time and look to be high quality manufactured, I haven't reworked the transmission as of yet, but believe everything is a complete match, will let you know.<br />Thanks for the quality service you have provided.<br />jimmy kingery
B00AYXM4DY|3|The rear bumper of my 2004 volvo had faded in to striped type pattern.  The product did not restore it to uniform color.  I could detect improvement on other plastic surfaces.  The product has a very unpleasant sickly sweet smell that exists even before opening product.  The smell goes away in a couple of days after applying to surface.
B00NB14PJ2|5|fix my gmc great. and they look very nice. love this sit..
B00L4TF32G|5|The best protectant out there.
B00DI3DV6G|2|Pretty flimsy and has a weird smell...but I suppose it does the job. My daughter's toys she keeps in the car are in one spot opposed to all over the backseat.
B00DRK7O18|5|Just bought this jack arrived on time as Prime promised 2 day free ship.Installed in 30 minutes. Hooked up wiring quiet until loading. But not excessive. Appears to be a quality jack. Time will tell. We camp yr. round and many hook ups. This jack makes hooking up equalizer bars easy. A word of caution though and the comical aftermath of and early first mistake. Undid three bolts  leaving washers stuck to base with paint tapped lightly and they came off. And WHAM THUMP Tounge of trailer fell droping.Trailer into sand. Luckily I had a floor jack in my truck. to raise it back up and block it. Next problem getting old jack out  of mounting hole. Large plate on bottom of jack was bolted on underside and rusted. Had to use my saws all and saw tube off then jack came right out. As I said earlier New Jack installed complete in 30 minutes. I think this Jack is an excelent buy. Especially at $116 I paid for it.

B0015RFIMM|5|The mount fit perfectly into my 05 Grand Prix and the price was cheaper than local part stores which only carried the Anchor brand which I have had no luck with.

B00KWNEQJG|3|First of all, my background to qualify this review: I'm an ASE certified technician with 17 years experience working in dealer service departments. With extensive technical training as well as customer-service oriented knowledge, I have high expectations whenever I use products or services of an automotive nature. Maybe that experience has spoiled me.<br /><br />I have to give props to the seller. I had these two full days before tracking said they were due. That was impressive.<br /><br />  Install happened this weekend, and aside from copious amounts of rust which fought me and slowed me down, was uneventful. Old joints popped out, new ones pressed in. I also chose to replace tie rod ends at this time, but that's a review for another time. The Synergy joints, in and of themselves, seem to be a solid product. Here is where my experience becomes disappointing.<br /><br />  The boots Synergy uses are not your typical black rubber. A/C Delco, or Moog, or NAPA, or any other given brand will usually have a fairly stiff, black rubber boot. This is nice because it provides resistance against the pressure of the grease when you pump grease into the joint. There is not much pressure, granted, but there is enough to cause the boot to bulge, which is what you look for as you pump grease in and it's how you know when to stop.<br /><br />  Synergy's ball joint boots are much lighter, both in color and in thickness. They are a translucent white material, and seem to be made of polyethylene or polyvinyl material. The material is much thinner and more pliable than run-of-the-mill rubber boots. The boot slips on and is held in place by a circular spring-style retainer at the smaller end of the boot.<br /><br />  Although the translucent material makes it easy to watch the grease as it fills the space inside the joint, it is also very susceptible to pushing the wide end of the boot, at the yoke side of the joint, off the machined metal retaining lip on the joint. I pumped grease in very slowly, and it could be seen to fill about half the empy space inside the boot before pushing the boot lip aside and seeping out onto the axle yoke. I stopped there to push the boot back onto the lip. Another quarter pump with the grease gun brought the same result, so I stopped there. When greasing the remaining three joints, I very slowly pumped grease and probably only got half a pump stroke in before they, too, showed signs of excessive bulging. This is not a case of over-greasing.<br /><br />  In addition to the boot issue, another irritation was that two of the grease fittings packaged with the joints (I don't recall if in just one package of joints or both, as there are two joints per package) were undersized for the holes in the joint machined for them. Not a big deal--I just grabbed two out of my stash and installed those.<br /><br />  Although the joint itself seems like a solid product, its performance seems handicapped by an excessively poor boot design. For a product billed as a premium component, with a price to match (although a reasonable price for what you get), attention to details seems lacking. I intend to watch carefully and inspect frequently over the next few weeks, but I don't have much confidence the boots on these joints can hold up to heavy-duty 4X4  applications they are ostensibly marketed for. Time will tell, and hopefully later I can edit this review for the better.lf the empy space inside the boot before pushing the boot lip aside and seeping out onto the axle yoke.

B00U68LPLO|3|What is pictured is not what I received, the straps are actually well built but good luck trying to get a hold of someone to fix the problem.
B00CJ097ZS|5|Nice price and fit perfectly.
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Handy tool to have with you. Had some electrical problems on last trip to Canada and this small device proved invaluable.
B0016680T0|5|I used this to avoid the ugly wheel weights on my bike. It worked exactly like advertised. I can't speak for its puncture healing properties, but my tires ride smooth, show very little signs of wear (because it keeps the tire cooler) and bike doesn't get wobbly on the highway.
B00FNP3YBE|1|wouldn't waste my money on this again. Did absolutely nothing to get &#34;golding&#34; out of my pipes
B0024E6UE0|5|worked good. Had to trim a bit with tin snips..... no big deal.
B00NFA8NRE|1|Xentec hid i dont like this product ballast burn out easily and now it doesnt work already
B005FRHHRM|5|I ordered back in 2015 just had time to put on car seats. The zippers on the rear car seat cover will not stay zipped ending up breaking. Hate I waited so long to use.
B008G5MD5G|5|Great lights blue as seen in the picture
B000FPY30I|3|Works ok but had to make my own brackets for the front lines
B005JWEWW6|3|Was hard to put on
B000IY692Q|4|Seems fine
B00QHJ2EHK|4|Best jump pack I have owned. It charges quite fast. And it can start a completely dead diesel truck. Tested on my lb7 Duramax. The only problem I have had is one of the clamps broke off and I had to have Amazon replace the unit. Although it did still start the vehicle you just had to have two people to hold it on the battery. The clamps are the only thing that were built cheap. You can get a very high quality set of cable clamps from your local motor parts store for under $10
B00M85FSY8|5|I am VERY pleased!!! I got it for my daughters sweet 16 surprise and I can hardly wait until next month!!!!! 10 stars!!
B00RU9UVN0|3|Good size and weight, plastic inserts not the best. Delivered on time pleased  but not overjoyed with knob. Time will be the determiner.
B00065JTD8|1|Garbage for night usage. Excellent daytime use  Extreme garbage do not purchase unless you intend to drive only in daylight
B00U7FIP0A|5|Work great deff blue!
B0039ZBLEC|1|Didn't clean any better than any other cleaner and did not do the job for which it was purchased.
B00GURQBIM|5|worked great
B000FW2NEY|5|Nice quality
B004UQQNC4|5|These make great tire scrubbers for cleaning the filthiest of tires. I use a 3 inch backing plate on a cordless drill and it makes short work of all the road grime and dirt. I highly recommend these.
B004HP3BNC|5|did the trick and speedy delivery.
B0064IU5FW|5|Totally worth the money I can feel the torque increase right away
B00CU79KTS|4|I love these glasses, Great price for the quality of product.
B00FA44WX2|5|This is a good product.  Installation and usage is no hassle.
B000AMXSUM|1|Does not fit a european jeep cherokee
B00514ALI6|5|Extensions worked perfectly.  Just as they said it would.
B001AHF494|5|Fits and works for my application.
B00A4U38O6|5|Perfect fit on 2003 excursion, plugged right in.  Had to add brown wire for running lights which my stock mirrors did not have.  I was really uncertain if they would fit because of what I read on several sites that said excursions were not the same plugs as the F250's. Look very stock and mirrors are not distorted.
B00KJGRLJI|5|love, love this fan.  bought it for the back of my GMC Terrain.  Since it is a small SUV it does not have air conditioning in the back.  I transport my dogs and this helps move cool air.  it fits in a &#34;pocket&#34; and plugs into the car's outlet.<br />great price and fast shipping
B00GX4Y9AY|1|Hot sale 15000mAH 2013 car jump starter car will not work, so I have not enjoyed it.  Harold
B00DV7F8C4|2|Longer than 15 feet. Did not fit my Dometic 15 foot awning!
B00KY0MR34|5|works good. great price compared to local, fast shipping.
B001KO4OD4|1|Amazon product fit is a Hoax, imagine this thing didn't fit my ride, 2007 Rav 4 Limited, Too Bad, I have it to mysef as a waste now!
B002M3KSK0|4|They fit the car, but make a humming noise when they are on.
B009DJXR1I|5|easy to paint and swap over hardware was on truck in no time  works great
B002UCYRZU|5|I first used this product back in the early 90's when I was working for a plant that made tanning beds and this product was used to remove scratches in the acrylic. I saw this recently on Amazon and wondered if it would clean my yellowed and foggy headlights on my car. I have tried many different things to clean them none of them worked watched many videos on YouTube none worked. This stuff with a bit of elbow grease works fantastic. I used #3 four times to get through the fog and the used #2 twice and then #1 once. The one on the right is so clear after cleaning see the photo.
B000C53QBS|5|The product is of very good quality
B00192JGDU|5|For once a company decides to create a bag that doesn't require pulling your hair out to get the item back into it.<br /><br />The carrying bag is sturdy, with a good handle for lugging it around.  Lugging isn't the right word, as this item isn't heavy at all.  Easily transportable by one person.<br /><br />The table sets up very easily.  The top &#34;planks&#34; piece that the grill is sitting on in the picture detaches, as well as wire rack underneath it and then you pull the two sides in and it folds up almost like a folding chair.<br /><br />It seems expensive for such a &#34;light&#34; item, but we're in the first world....so just be grateful you have a grill and need it. :-)<br /><br />It is sturdy.  I pushed down on the side tables to see if they're fold under pressure and they didn't give much.<br /><br />I'd probably buy it again because of how easy it compacts and can be thrown in a closet until its next use.
B0000AY3DS|1|Horrible quality plastic.  Plastic mounting bracket stretched and doesn't hold mirror.  You get what you pay for...junk
B000CGP13I|5|Put them on an 09 forester and so far it's really good, no break noise and pretty gripy compared to stock pad.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Got it for my son, he really enjoys it.
B0106NR1GQ|3|Looks solid. Came with all hardware needed. Will install this week and update on fitment and results
B00J7RB72M|5|CD case works rather well for the amount of CDs that I own. Thank you!
B0059HJSA2|2|the material is nice and heavy the little roller wheels are nice as they keep the unit from getting scuffed on cement.  I put the unit under my truck and until the steam of oil was pouring then walked away , 2 min later i had 10 qrts of black oil on the cement. the stream slowed down and then totally missed the hole.  I guess one would have to wait a couple mins before leaving  to make sure it is in a good position to receive the waste oil.  sorry about returning it.  I got a nicer one at Wal Mart for $10 which is longer and oil cant miss the container but it is a little more work to clean up the oil where it lands.
B009SUJU54|5|Great bike gloves. Really help with the vibrations from my enduro.
B00CQAR1V8|3|Vinyl Awning was as expected and installation went smoothly. The only problem found is some slightly larger than pinhole sized damaged spots about 1 foot down from top of awning and running most of the way across the awning. Most of the spots were unseen until the awing was installed though the.largest spots were visible while still in plastic wrap but looked like dirt spots.  Contacted the company and was asked to submit pictures. Don't feel the problem will show on a picture since we applied silicone to the 5 most apparent spots of damage and the rest of the spots are so small. Just hope that this awning will last for a while....
B00KTIYXLU|5|Was a breeze to program and works great!
B000IYYTUK|5|Fit my 2006 Volvo V50.  Much cheaper than a factory one.
B00KOI0E5Y|5|The helmet was delivered on time and is an excellent product.
B004RCKKM0|5|I lost the set that came with the stereo, and I needed to pull the stereo out.  The package arrived just as I was starting to work on the stereo.  KUDOs
B00262NYPS|5|So easy to install, even a Mom can do it.
B004BCJCD4|5|Purchased these to replace the original equipment on our '01 Denali.  &#34;I can see clearly now.....&#34;  Easy to install, simple to aim and I feel much better knowing my son has better visibility at night.
B006N9G14G|5|WORKS WONDERFUL
B002JATYOC|5|Good quality..would purchase again.
B004JAZZI4|5|Fits great on my 2014 Sierra
B00SBZRKEU|5|Just bought this pump and it worked perfectly.  Pumped the gas into out boat quickly and with zero spills!
B004I10JBW|5|Worked fine thanks!
B004SMGAJ6|5|I have a Chevy Avalanche that the suspension compresses a lot when a trailer is on. This gives me so much adjust ability up and down I love it!
B007RHA5KE|5|It was exactly what I was looking for.
B00QXYL6LY|5|Fit good on my infiniti g35 steering wheel.
B00VNJ4DKK|1|Lasted a week already broke. Poor signal. Do not buy. Waste of money
B00WOXX4OA|4|The right compressor for my 2009 maxima, however the hole was not quite big enough slightly off about 1/10 of a centimeter. I immediately called and they email me a return label and my account was credited.
B00080QHMM|5|Works as advertised
B004IZF8BO|4|Product worked great once installed. Installation instructions need to be a little more detailed. Someone who has never done a job like this before would have a difficult time. The product is working great now after being installed for roughly a month. I would recommend the product.
B00A82PEN8|5|This head light fit perfectly!!! It also works well! 100% satisfied!
B009FUF6DM|3|a lower quality microfiber cloth
B0013GF8YS|5|Product is exactly what is described.<br />No flaws, no scratches. Will keep buying for all my cars.
B00UM9UCE8|5|Convenient and easy to change in my Sonata.  Dealership wants $59 to change the cabin air filter that costs less than $15 and takes 3 minutes to change.  Your don't even get your hands dirty.
B00T9AGBOQ|5|I use a portable refrigerator in my Wrangler, and have run the battery low enough to need a jump start.  So, I thought something like this might be just right.  I'm sure you have seen all the different models, and how they have different capacities and ratings for engine size.  I figured, you have to start somewhere, and this had good reviews.<br /><br />2 days after it arrived, I ended up at a camp-out, where a minivan and a pickup couldn't start.  I plugged in the cables, and both started right up.  The battery level on the jump starter still showed mostly full.  This was absolutely amazing, and certainly surprised my friends.<br /><br />The flashlight on the end is OK, but the LED panel is bright.  The fact that it has the ability to charge other stuff like actual laptops (19 and 16V), plus 12V and 5V at high current (2.1A) is an added plus--although you want to charge it up when you are done.  Otherwise, it won't be ready when your car battery goes bad.<br /><br />It comes with lots of adapters and in a nice case.  I really think this is underpriced for its performance.
B0055EALW8|5|Fantastic!
B00PLI01NW|5|Excellent product
B0012PM050|2|After receiving a 2nd set, Upper mount bushing was not in eyelet.....1st set no bushing in eyelet.....2nd set no bushing in eyelet .....Autozone purchased and now back on road
B007Y86JC4|5|It fit my 2008 jeep wrangler like it said an still works..so good buy
B008LG24OK|5|It fit and it worked.
B0002X520S|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B003Z9T33I|5|Very easy to install, no issues with our cover. It has been just what we needed and seems to be holding up great!
B000CIV716|5|I use synthetic oil, and Mobil 1 filters. Are they really any better than Fram, etc? The tests I've read seem to indicate they are, and the peace of mind is worth the extra cost.
B0031I4HNE|5|Just what I needed and at a fraction of the price from the mechanic
B0007VANJK|5|I installed this alone with a home depot bucket for supporting the other end in about 2 hours - including the electrical T connector purchased separately. When you &#34;loosen&#34; the 6-8 of bolts up under there, that hold the bumper on. You need to VERY loosen them, to get the hitch up between that area. I had only half loosened them, and that wasn't enough, they need to be practically falling out. You can maneuver your knees up under your rear bumper, and align the hitch your self. Probably better and safer to have a helper though. My dog did not help, she only licked me and kept stealing the bolts I'd lay next to me.
B00KA3Z0G6|4|nice product. It was spendy....but made hubby happy
B000W0RQCI|2|Feels like a tough loch but the pin occasionally gets stuck closed and is finicky to remove from the bike...maybe just a little grease will fix it.
B00OTLE1HY|4|Great graphics, but the plates themselves are not very substantial. Certainly light-weight though, so good to keep in your camping kit or your vintage trailer!
B00HHGBEM8|5|awesome..
B00INZ65B2|5|Worked great. Repaired speedo only since others still working fine.
B004NSJQYQ|4|Serves the purpose.
B00HVHNBM4|5|Fits well and it is really stylish
B00BFE5FF0|5|This was and exact fit and resolved the headlight issue. Passenger side headlight would remain on even after the old switch was turned off and key removed from car.  Very pleased with the product.
B00GWC7YYA|5|fit perfectly and perfect color match.
B007CLM120|4|This is really a fantastic product.  I've read reviews of consumers complaining about the brightness of the light, but I've not experienced that at all.  These really light up the road well, but the main thing is they get other drivers attention, and being on a motorcycle, that's what it's all about!!  I have these in a 2005 BMW R1200RT.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because of the installation instructions.  They are really pretty weak, but there are plenty of You Tube videos to guide you through this.
B00861NPAC|5|+5
B000F09CF4|4|Spout should be made better. No way to seal complely. Needs solid cap.
B001GJ3FIS|1|Terrible. It sprays without even pressing the handle and sprays sideway and unevenly. Once I turn my hose on, this thing is already spraying and wasting water as I walk to where I'm going to use it.
B00Y5F4JQW|5|Fits my truck and looks good. Works and does what it is supposed to do. Keeps your hand off the end of the stick.
B00QFY2BCK|5|Unfortunately I didn't take a picture but this item is amazing! I love the way it worked. I highly recommend!
B005OZNZD0|5|great value program them myself
B0058WXNOK|1|Junk . Do not buy. Just as bad as the Permatex one. Coloring will not cure. What a rip off. Should have listened to the other reviewers. Amazon should not sell.
B004GC4N1K|1|Looks correct, but that's about it.  Vibrates like crazy and hard to see out of it, but in my case it works because it's just there to keep my crawler street legal, and if it gets busted the next time it rolls over so be it cuz it was cheap.  If you want something that actually works as a mirror for you, though, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE.
B000WJX4BQ|5|we had quick delivery and the battery is an exact replacement, it works great!  Thanks for the great service!<br /><br />Dale Harris
B0042LHNV2|4|this is great for I don't like checking the water in the battery because its difficult to get to!
B00X04JRMU|5|This stuff is great.  Drought means, no more long car baths, but that's not a problem with this wash.  I take a car duster to reduce the particles on the surface, or give it a simple pre-wash to loosen up dirt, and then get to work.  This is very easy to use.  Spray a little area, give it a few seconds, take your towel and work it softly, and then wipe dry.  Small sections at a time.  Leaves a noticeable clean surface, and it smells nice too.  After having used this for four weeks, I've noticed dust doesn't stick to the paint as much and each subsequent wash has been easier and easier.  Don't forget to add a clay bar once in a while, and you have an easy wash routine that will look great.  As you can see, all you need is a wet bucket, a dry bucket and your spray wash.
B00WN3R85M|5|It came late but it's doing its job thank you!!
B00PQW0ZUM|1|It's not what you ewould expect all it was is a little piece of tint and when you try to return it back they won't respond to!!!
B004AIHKT2|5|replaced my little pink thingy...like a charm.<br /><br />super fast shipping.<br /><br />Awesome
B00GBP89RO|5|arrived promptly easy install
B004A6954C|5|Excellent products, fit in my Jeep cj5 1977
B00ODVEWPG|5|Flat mounting, good switch, nice and bright. I have it under a counter cabinet in my camper. easy hookup.
B0009TQ78G|5|This filter is AWESOME,  it filters fuel so well, it's like I have a supercharged engine now, the boat really gets up and moves now, so fast even skiers can't hang on for anything.... on a serious note,,, it's a stock style replacement. It fits and works as a standard fuel filter does. :-/
B0067XKGM6|5|Pretty awesome buy! It folds up and velcros together as it comes. Perfect for camping.
B0009NUG66|5|This product worked great, it rained pretty hard for 1 hr while traveling, nothing was wet.  Just make sure you secure it tightly, we used rope as a reinforcement, more for peach of mind.  Holds a lot, we put all clothing up there in trash bags.
B003XKK7ES|5|Very cute!
B00E1SOHY2|5|Vary happy with my  perche
B00BI3MYY8|5|Replaced the upstream O2 sensor on my 2006 Civic LX 4-door sedan. Works perfectly. No errors thrown. No wires to splice. Direct fit and clips into the existing harness. Even comes with thermal anti-seize paste.
B002HXW4B6|5|Perfect fit. Love it.
B00HUBXBBM|4|The fabric rubs off. Should have a good breathable fabric cover.
B006T3MLFY|5|Easy to install and looks way better than the aftermarket racks
B00HLAGLLE|5|The only thing better is if they came and installed it for me.  Works.
B00WTKKPZY|3|Easy to install.after having for three months the rubber mats are pulling away from the the tape underneath,not happy with this result,and it wasnt that hot here in MA.
B003CXR2QM|4|Good well made cover. A little bulkier than I expected but a great cover none the less.
B0116EJ9HI|5|Looks good in my 96 ss. Pic is before clean up because shifter knob reflection was too bright.
B00HJS459S|5|great stuff worked fine
B005M4GC74|1|Mailed from China. Took two weeks to come. Glue instead of clip. Too big. Doesn't fit. I am returning this piece of s*** part and I hope you all do too.
B00U5OKH22|4|Fit good gives an slight aggressive look
B000F5LJQO|5|These hoses are very good, alone with the price of them. I think they are just as good as Yellow Jacket hoses or even better, when comparing prices and quality.
B00ZLKCLK6|4|Typical Cardo product.  Skimpy manual,  poorly written, missing lots of detail.  Product does most of the things, most of the time.  If you want a bullet proof product, this is NOT it.  probable better than the other guys xxxx20.  The product should be better after four revisions, but it isn't.<br /><br />Last but not least,  way high price.
B001EOV45G|5|perfect fit, great price
B008VOMIIE|5|great topper
B005BNG1U4|3|These are moreso for decoration.  Not a lot of padding.
B00K9BD4IK|3|A little too large.. But ok.. Where are the Smaller inside the glass Stickers?  Where?
B000HL10PQ|5|Love it. Thanks
B007TY0G1I|4|Easy assembly. Fits pretty well. Good value assuming it lasts.
B00BUX36WU|1|Brought this item for my 2012 Chevy Malibu although it looks pretty It was much to small i am returning this item i will not purchase another steering wheel cover on line
B000C2U77M|5|GREAT
B00QRE0OOA|4|The ELM327 worked great using the ScanMaster s/w provided but the iphone app did not.
B00J52R3LS|5|I love it the best investment I could ever buy for myself out here on the road for my truck
B004RIPGW8|4|These are great decals, I just don't understand why it took three weeks to get them.
B004D3CD2S|5|Works great and as advertised.
B00BAZCPW0|5|Great headlights
B004MU8VRS|5|Exact same as my other one, easy to install, looks good
B00B1PNIO8|2|perfect for my Mini Cooper s , but I pay for the original brand and received a replacement brand
B0002JMTLW|5|Cheap and easy fix...almost too cheap and easy lol
B008PK9R8S|5|Very pleased with my purchase!!
B00INZ65B2|5|Not hard to install at all and have fixed all the gauges. Great product.
B007ZDFV4U|5|Received quickly and just as pictured.
B000NBWCFC|5|Purchased this product (along with Tracer Products TP34000601 UV Fluorescent Leak Detection Dye - Set of 6) to diagnose a persistent oil leak on my wife's 2006 Kia Sedona. While the oil leak wasn't tremendous in volume, it had gotten everywhere and was making the job of determining the exact source of the leak quite difficult indeed.<br /><br />After placing a 1 ounce bottle of the tracer dye in the oil and driving around the neighborhood for a bit, I took a look with the detection light while wearing the yellow-colored glasses. Initially, the areas fluorescing were difficult to see. After turning out the lights in my shop, however, it was much easier to see and I was able to pinpoint the source of the leak.<br /><br />Since its initial purchase, I've been able to use this product often to help diagnose oil leaks for a number of other vehicles belonging to friends and family. For better or worse, my home shop has become the go-to place for friends and family looking to diagnose an oil leak before taking it to the shop for this purpose. Of course, the real money-saver for the DIYer is if you're willing to make the repair as well as part of the process.<br /><br />My only complaint, while minor, is the need to have the vehicle in the dark in order to adequately see there areas where the tracer fluid is fluorescing. There are probably stronger lights out there that would preclude this need, but for the price, it's a small thing to have to turn off the lights for a bit in order to see the leak clearly.
B00L4G91V8|5|Seems to be okay-- still working after a 100 hours or so.
B002RSIK4G|3|Works ok but hard to install
B00079Y7OE|5|the jacket fits very well, little stiff but being new you expect. it arrived at the time scheduled in excellent condition.
B001KO5BRM|1|Does not fit 2005 XL1200R, coil end terminals do not plug into Harley coil (too large - could probably be forced, but these wires are using a standard distributor cap sized terminal, H-D wires use a smaller diameter terminal), the coil end boots also are too large to engage the H-D coil.  And the lengths are wrong... probably usable were it not for the other issues, but certainly can't follow the original wire path.
B00TW267MW|5|They seem to be pretty good quality and the price was not bad at all.
B00KGGTF9U|5|Fits my 2015 impala very well.
B001FHQQJG|4|The part was a little different but works just fine!
B003SS62PS|3|It works fine, it does what it is supposed to. It is on the big size. it helps when i sit in my car on my lunch..
B000CD38BS|5|great
B0046IC24O|5|As good as the OEM product, and super easy to program!
B00FAIBHB8|3|Didn't fit my 2011 A6.  It was just off.  Nothing really wrong with it except I can't use it. Probably my fault for not measuring and what not
B00QQUBEBM|2|This is something that could easily be made at home.  I actually questioned the purchase in the beginning and wished I would have passed.  I'll keep it and use it but definitely not worth the money.
B005D1HVAS|5|Cute car sticker that was requested by my son, whose family have schnauzers.  He loves it.
B00042KJQ4|1|this product is  not safe  to use with jack  slicker than snot
B000FQBWCY|3|I have been through 2 of these in the last 3 years. I like the product and it works well, I especially like the plug system they use. But the durability isn't great. All mine do is just sit on a bench and charge either my motorcycle or collector car and still I haven't gotten more than 2 years out of one. When this one breaks I will try another brand.
B0066T5RH0|3|ok
B003XRQWCC|5|Fast shipping. Good product.
B000G76SR6|5|easy install
B00M9MGH0O|5|Love these grips! Looks awesome and has good grip!
B008HZK38Y|5|Very quiet brake pads! I'm happy. Thanks!
B00DTBU6AG|5|I love this seat! The product  went onto my 2014 Street Glide easily. It makes riding long distances much more comfortable.
B00KTIUID2|4|Very easy to program and use. Doesn't quite have the range of the factory one. Quick shipping and a solid product so far.
B00ONHADCG|5|love them!
B0024NSMBU|5|Fit perfectly on my 2004 Toyota Camry XLE. I don't know anything about cars but I watched the YouTube video and installed it in about 1 hour. I used a racket wrench and a flat head screwdriver (and some plastic gloves to keep my manly hands clean). I also read how to properly line up the headlights which took another 15 minutes to get them to the right angle. The Camry looks way better after. I just ordered new fog lights to match. Hopefully they are as easy to install.
B00A82A2ZS|5|Fast service. Exactly what I wanted.
B004ME11FS|5|Works just fine and fit as it should have. No funny chemical smells even when house is sitting in full sun.
B00YBFTK92|4|The lavender version works better
B002P8LWDO|5|it a good price.
B00GJYUZ9M|4|Solid helmet. Comfortable, way quieter than mine previous, and internal sun screen is amazing. Vents work better than in my previous helmet, and I think it looks good. Only two complaints... I use a third-party Bluetooth communication device, which is intended to clamp onto the shell of the helmet, but this one has a weird plastic skirt around the bottom, which makes it quite difficult to install the clamp, and its never been quite as secure as it should be. Second, apparently Nolan only uses one size of shell for all helmet sizes (so the smaller sizes just have more padding and foam). As a result, the helmet looks almost comically large, even in medium. if you needed a small, I'm sure it would make you look like a bobblehead.
B00DB8H0EC|5|Perfect fit for a 2011 SS Camaro, strongly crafted and pride in workmanship.
B00HFX38U4|5|Very well made and accurate. It is made in China but I think they do quality control.
B000C1E8NM|5|Fit our 2012 Acura MDX driver front door perfectly!
B0001EXBPQ|5|Hard to get on
B0027UKMFE|5|Very satisfied
B00DP89L04|5|Great cover at a good price.  Well made. No complaints so far.
B000WK8CSU|3|Works very well to block wind with no flex or buffeting.  Only real problem is that I had to make brackets out of the old shield hardware to attach it to my Honda Shadow 1100.  The shock tube brackets were too small for the Shadow.
B00GHSGDPU|5|It took a while to figure out which way it fit on brake pedal but fits well.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Was skeptical but not anymore. Have had it up for a couple months now and it works awesome. Bright white light that fills the carport with evenly. Mounted my solar panel vertically so dust and dirt doesn't get on the solar panel and diminish the amount of sunlight it collects. Would buy again.
B00M8GF00Y|5|Love it!  The emblem matches exactly as on my XC-90!
B009C4SQ1A|5|got it quick fit as good as they ever do am happy with price
B0063CU5CM|5|fit well, looks good
B0002AJR8E|5|I've been working on my own vehicles for about forty years, now. I was stupid. This is the single, easiest, cleanest, fastest way I have EVER changed oil. I haven't changed the oil myself in some time ... Engine compartments are cramped. I live in a condo. I'm to busy. (Want any more excuses?) But, my &#34;new&#34; car has access to the filter from the top of the engine, so I figured this would be a better alternative to paying a mechanic 130 bucks to do something I am more than capable of doing myself. I was right. Eight quarts of oil out, filter changed, and crankcase refilled with eight quarts of oil in 25 minutes. And this was my first time using this gizmo. I may go try out for someone's NASCAR pit crew. Buy this. You will not be disappointed.
B00N58VRYC|5|Sea Foam has worked great in my power boat. Increased the performance of my engine. Other fuel stabilizers robbed it off horse power
B000GZJFPK|5|It's a very good glass for the price 23$.<br />It fits perfectly. And it's very useful for the bike riders and for others to.<br />If you are looking for a glass at this price this will the best blindly go for it.<br />Only thing is it came in a kind of big envelope package and I didn't expected it that is the only concern however the product is good.
B00JPIQD5Y|5|Well worth the money.
B00BP5Q6KC|5|This is my first helmet and for the price is really really nice. Very nice color, it feels very durable and comfortable . My dad has a Harley Davidson helmet, the same color, his helmet was $250.00 and to be honest this helmet looks the same on quality as the HD's $250.00 and for $49.99 its a very good deal. This is a &#34;M&#34; size. Now i'm not a tall guy, probably around 5'8 so I think that you should stick with M or above. Also I recommend measuring your head, it will help a lot on deciding the sizes. Here is an example picture how it looks wearing it, riding a BMW G650gs. I know I know I look funny lol
B001W38484|5|works good
B001A3GJEM|5|Very good snow removal tool.  Like a snow plow for your vehicle ! Product as advertised ! Very happy with this product.
B00HAQBEH0|4|I spent quite a bit of time shopping around for a good LED work light, and have been very happy with my purchase.<br />The light is very bright and useful and lasts for a good while on a set of batteries (sorry, I haven't kept good track of exactly how long - I used it for about 6 hours and it worked well.)<br />My favorite feature, besides the cool strip LED, is the magnetic clip - however I wish it was a bit stronger to be able to hold the light in more positions.<br /><br />Over all a good light and I would buy it again.
B00JGP8I1S|4|I needed an additional visor to help with the blinding sun and glare. This works as stated.<br />My only gripe is that I thought it was an extension of my already existing visor (what I was looking for) because being 5' the visor never extends low enough for me. I first installed according to the directions but found I had to sit uncomfortably. I ended up changing the direction so I could use it as an extension of my visor and it works great! The only problem is when using it this way, I can't use the nighttime visor as I had planned. It does make things clearer and sharper but I wish it was designed differently.
B0006JLW84|4|Great replacement cover and easy install with a minor tweak. We'll see if it lasts as long as the higher priced ones.
B00XINZ8TO|5|Works great, good quality, functional and arrived quickly.
B008FTZOJ0|5|bursted it easy<br />oh well
B00C4YRGQQ|5|Handguards were easy to attach to my KLR 650 and performed well during my 14000 mile journey from USA to Panama and back. During this time, the bike was dropped more than a handful of times, on varying terrain, with only scratches to the plastic covers on the handguards.<br /><br />I've never used the more expensive handguard brands but the Trackside handguards have proven themselves very reliable and I would definitely buy them again.
B000N9XFUK|5|easy install
B00J00X3NW|5|It's the only oil I use for all of my vehicles. Change the oil myself, and pay the same amount as if I had a company do it with cheapo oil
B00KHDTGIC|5|Great decal
B00K33WFA2|4|Looks good and works great! The price for a aluminum radiator was affordable. You do need to do some modifications on your brackets that hold it in, but overall it does what I expected it to.
B00P2D3VZG|5|I use these for the tag lights in my 2002 Dodge Ram 2500. I've had them installed for about six months now and they work great. They put just the right amount of light on my tag, which is much brighter than the standard incandescent bulb without being too bright. Looks very nice and sharp. They have been holding up well considering this truck has a pretty stiff ride.  If you plan on replacing the tag light bulbs on a similar truck, you may want look at replacing the license plate lamp wiring since the plastic bulb socket [[ASIN:B004G4H6M6 NEW! 1994-2001 Dodge Ram License Plate Lamp Wiring OEM MOPAR]]becomes broken down over time. Requires two and are easy to replace.
B00ZD06PLU|5|Beautiful design and good fit!

B003RVUYJG|5|Excellent!!, fast shipping, include easy to follow programming instructions.

B000C7Y8MC|5|worth the replacement for the original in my 2001  mitsubishi eclipse gt<br />easy installation and now the car shifts without a hiccup or kicking.<br /><br />a straight replacement to fix the code and definitely worth the price.
B00BITHUPK|5|Excellent fit. The only thing I did was ordered the wrong color, but it works as origin.
B00J21UZWG|5|Just got it installed it is awesome looks great extremely bright 10/10 would buy again

B001O1X65A|5|its fine

B00YJL8DDW|5|great value and fits fine
B00L3LEEYS|2|Just good for opeining the door, transmitter not included, might as well buy the real McCoy from a auto dealer. Not usable to start the car.
B004VY6NG6|5|Great size and very useful.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
B000AS3D3S|1|Not sure what it fits, but it sure don't fit my car, had to go to the store for the right one.
B00684TAYY|5|It worked as a described, very easy to program, It worked on the Nissan Sentra 2011 just like the original
B000P0VTG4|4|This tool works fine with one exception. When I turned the knob to release the compressed valve spring, the knob unscrewed from the from the threaded rod. I had to install a nut below the knob to lock it on the threaded rod. No big deal, but the manufacturer should have taken care of this.
B009X1QTKC|5|Awesome Shocks...instant change in the handling on my truck!!
B006NYHTL0|5|As advertised. No problems 2008 Mazda 3 S 5-door

B009FUF6DM|5|good price, good quality
B000VL4554|5|Installed on a 2007 Yukon, sound is great, not to loud but you can hear it at idle if your listening and opens up at higher rpm. Excellent quality as well, always had a good experience from Magnaflow!
B000CB0XJ0|5|correct fit for 1998 Camry.  install was straightforward.

B00T36HLYU|5|love them they fit great!
B00Q5HXQ9O|5|I just bought a new car with automatic adjustable seat but still felt I was sitting too low and needed a boost at the back of the seat.  I had purchased one seat wedge ( a lot cheaper) and it just didn't work.  I decided to purchase this car seat after carefully reading all the reviews and the company description.  This car seat is exactly as described by the manufacturer.  It is very comfortable and lifts me just high enough to feel comfortable while driving.  I no longer feel as though I am sitting in a hole.  What I really like is how it secures around the seat so, when you slide in and out of your vehicle, the seat is always in place.  I highly recommend this car seat to anyone who feels like they are sitting in a hole and wants a lift up.
B005CW9MN2|5|I have an older 1965 Merc 650 that just broke the timing belt..  (30 year old belt!!!!!)  Contacted Heartland Products directly to see if it would fit, and they gave me measurements to confirm it would.  Flywheel popped off like a champ!!  Excellent tool.  So worth it, even if I only use it once considering what my local Mercury Dealer wanted for labor to pull my flywheel off !!!
B000WJEKHI|4|Looks to be of a reliable design. I'm a little bummed though because a few reviews claimed their key came with two circuits - one open-to-closed, and one closed-to-open when the key switch is turned. Mine, however, did not come with four wires, only two. A better description of the product would be greatly appreciated, because even though mine is pictured correctly, you don't always get what is pictured as some reviewers will tell you.
