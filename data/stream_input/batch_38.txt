B00004Y6NP|5|great it
B005LAII12|3|had some funny parts but overall was just too nasty with their language and everything for it to be considered a great movie.
B005E9SMPC|1|This book has insufferable characters, dialog, and story.  Here are three examples of many:<br /><br />1) Someone says to Rourke, &#34;I know you detest parties like this, but that's no reason not to go&#34; What?!  Of course it is.<br /><br />2)  &#34;Did you know that Peter Keating is an old friend of Howard Rourke?&#34;<br />&#34;No. Is he?&#34;<br /><br />3) Peter Keating says, &#34;Howard's a friend of mine.&#34;<br />Ellsworth Touhey responds, &#34;A friend of yours? Do you know him?&#34;<br />Peter Keating answers, &#34;Why, we went to school together. Stanton, you know? Why, he lived in our house for three years.&#34;<br />&#34;He lived in your house in Stanton?&#34;<br /><br />Having people not get it the first time makes for a lot of repetition. Long diatribes are nothing more than  sermons. I had this book on my mp3 player. It got so bad, when I fast forwarded, Ellsworth was still droning on. There wasn't a single likable character. Maybe this book was good in the past, but in 2015 it falls on its head.
B0074D3CAQ|5|One of the best read lately or ever.
B000083E79|5|She will always stay young!!! Her voice still sounds awesome and amazing, and will never grow old!!

B0017KIBAI|5|Great item fully satisfied
B00FAPF5U0|4|Can't wait for more like this
B008BQ8VOC|5|I definitely recommend this series to friends. Love the wit, style, characters and intelligence of this show. Can't wait for the seasons premier
B00RNRD7Y4|5|Seriously one of the funniest movies I have seen in awhile. AMAZING! Must see, and why not take an opportunity to piss of North Korea!
B0000CDLA7|3|Hmmm. Difficult one this. Yes, I'm a lifelong fan of DT,and they are my favourite band, so I'm coming at this from what I hope is an informed background. But 'Train of Thought'has provided me with a dilemma. Why? Well, it is, without doubt, the heaviest and most 'metal' album they've produced to date. So far, so good, as I also love Metallica, Pantera etc. But after many listens to 'Train..' I just can't get overly excited about it -and I can't quite put my finger on exactly why this should be. It's production is great, the playing & musicianship is stunning (as always), and it has genuinely sublime moments; but as a whole it seems, to me, to lack some of the 'magic' that previous DT albums have had, that secret ingredient that made Images & Words, Awake & particularly Scenes From a Memory some of the best prog / metal albums ever made. Worryingly, it also appears to be following a trend - 'Six Degrees...' the last album, was frankly patchy, and 'Train...' follows this pattern. Many of the riffs sound like re-hashed DT songs, and whilst they are perfectly within their rights to self-plagiarise, this is a first for a band that pride themselves on originality. They should have taken a year off, rather than writing an album in three weeks (fact)! I just hope that they don't 'do a Metallica' and not be able to recover from their masterpiece(Dream Theater's 'Scenes from a Memory' is the equivalent of Metallica's 'Black Album', in my humble opinion). However, it's still better than most stuff churned out by younger, more trendy bands, and my advice is if you like your music heavy and have never tried Dream Theater, this is the album for you.
1853262390|2|For all dyed-in-the-wool Virginia Woolf fans, my review will be anathema.  People who review books often review the ones they love especially, but I review each one, good or bad.  I started this novel in high hopes.  I had never read the famous British author and I looked forward to a special treat.  The background to the rich and handsome Orlando seemed promising, his adventures interesting, but then weirdness grew and became overpowering.  I didn't mind that he turned into a woman, but even so, whatever the sex of the protagonist, we need a plot in the novel.  The descriptions of his doings seemed less and less relevant, his/her gender fluctuations assumed more and more importance, and I finally decided that I just didn't care.  What I really didn't like about ORLANDO is that there is a sub-text, closed to those of us of this day and age, who are not privy to the intimate doings of the Bloomsbury set, who did not sit together with V. Woolf and listen to her read her latest chapters, chuckling knowingly as they recognized the models for the various characters.  I felt excluded.  And why would I read a novel from which I was excluded ?  Well, the answer, dear reader, is that I wouldn't.  And I don't recommend that you do either.<br /><br />People tell me that Woolf's other novels are much better and of a different type.  So, I am not condemning the writer, only the book.  And, OK, maybe you will like it.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
B004XJRQUQ|4|I enjoyed reading the HUNGER GAME TRILOGY.. Book 2 was my favorite. Looking forward to seeing the movie... If you are looking for a good read this is it.If I may suggest read the books before you see the movie!!!!
B003R50FRI|5|By far the best book i read. Such a good read and cant wait to read the sequel. Well done linbaba :)
B00EMXBDMA|5|Loved this book from beginning to end.  I only wish he had taken the story a little farther....

B009NY43NY|5|I love this Sookie Stackhouse just as much as I did the others. I just hate that the series is over.
0739383728|5|I am a beginning runner.  Just started to run for about half a year ago.  This book has a lot of interesting concepts about running.  And there are so many interesting stories and make it a great novel reading.  I like to listen to it when I run.  It makes me smile or even laugh while running.  I recommended to all the runners!!!
B00991TCOG|5|Dancings, plays an epic violin, has alot of video game related music videos (skyrim, zelda, assassin's creed)... Need I say more?
B00005QG9J|3|I hate using the SO word...and I'm not totaly convinced this is one of the very few ocassions I use it.  (Sugar Ray that's it) But I really can not stand how Morning View is just a simpler rehash of Make Yourself, I remember when Incubus' style would change with every record.  SCIENCE sounded nothing like Fungus Amongus and Make Yourself sounded nothing like SCIENCE.   Yet they have a successful single and they seem to make an album of Drives and Stellars with a few really forced sounding heavier tracks thrown on.  <br />Wish You Were Here is a disgrace to the Incubus fans from their experimental era.  But the rest of the album isn't horrible and actually has a few bright spots, Blood On The Ground, Mexico, and Just A Phase are great songs and I love the additions of strings and more acoustics on the album, I just wish they were used in a way that made the album sound different compared to Make Yourself.  However gone is the funk, metal, and jazz of their former releases.  Which doesn't help at all mind you.<br />I'll probably end up selling this album fairly quickly...
B00FWPWNKS|4|I've only worked through half of the easy puzzles and they have proved challenging.  However, I feel it provides just the right amount of difficulty to keep my interest.
0307477479|4|I really enjoyed reading little connected short stories, which I did not expect. I thought that this would be a typical novel but I realized it wasn't about three chapters in. I loved that a minor character (or just a name mentioned) in one chapter was the star of the next. Really, I LOVED that. I loved that the author was able to describe certain feelings (loneliness, embarrassment, longing, etc) in an extremely creative way - she really put into words the visceral reaction that comes along with pangs of guilt or awkwardness.<br /><br />One of my favorite chapters is the slide journal chapter. I understand that some people might hate it or think that it doesn't fit into the book, but the author uses a different writing style for each chapter, representing the inner workings of that star character. The slide journal is written by a tween girl in the 2020's, and I thought it was a perfect representation of a young girl in the not-so-far-off future... especially considering PowerPoint techniques are currently taught in schools!<br /><br />I wanted some chapters to go on and on so I could learn more about the characters, but I wanted some chapters to end quickly because I didn't really care about those events or people. I didn't like the texting in the last chapter, but I did like the author's views on the future and on how we will communicate. A lot of her observations/predictions had me thinking a few days after I completed the book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a series of connected short stories that provide one with the \\"big picture\\" of different times and events and people.
B009EEOQIU|5|Very Good.Excellent Acting  and a great Improvement on the cartoon version!
B005ZOBNOI|5|This was a story very well written! Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I could relate to the characters and got so emotionally attached, especially to Hazel and Augustus. I would highly recommend to anyone in search of an incredible story, emotional journey, and characters that will capture your heart! Keep tissues near by, you will certainly need them!
B006LSZECO|5|Wow! I so enjoyed reading this book. I lost several hours of sleep staying up late into the night. That's one of my favorite things, finding a novel that I just can't put down. I've read so many books lately that seem to be a chore to get through, with plots that I don't spend any extra time thinking about. Gone Girl surprised me, and held my attention until the very last sentence. What more can you ask for in a novel?
B00008BXJF|4|Praise: King Crimson continue to make quality progressive rock music after 30 years. There are some memorable tracks here like: Eyes Wide Open, Facts Of Life and Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With. The instrumental tracks like Level Five, Elektrik and Dangerous Curves are well conceived and executed.<br />Criticism: The band attempt nothing new or original. This is pretty similar to The Construkction Of Light and Thrak. Also, although I appreciate the talents of Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn, I miss the originality of Tony Levin and Bill Bruford. Adrian Belew and Robert Fripp appear to be what make The Power To Believe halfway original and inventive. I did not appreciate The Power To Believe being reprised a total of FOUR times! Nor did I appreciate the Facts Of Life Intro. I think the band could have come up with five more full length originals.<br />Conclusion: I think Crimson fans will enjoy this if they're not comparing it to old Crimson. If you like Belew-era Crimson you will enjoy this.
B00F8L2VO4|5|I love this app! Such a great way to learn German. My husband and I are learning together, it really helps to have someone to converse with.
B00GU9E17I|2|This movie had so many possibilities, but they were largely squandered.  The writing for the movie was predictable, less-than-intelligent, and coarse.  There is so much cursing in the movie that it's distracting and detracting from the story.  In addition to the swearing, for some reason, the director decided to put a bunch of nudity in this installment of the Riddick series, and there is nothing I like less than pointless, gratuitous nudity.
0992251656|5|The game is wonderful and extremely enjoyable, which is good because we haven't managed to complete a game in under 3.5 hours yet.  I suspect this will improve as we learn the rules and become more familiar with the unique aspects of each card.  What makes the game so enjoyable, despite the long game play, is the total immersion into Firefly verse.  The attention given to every detail, every action, every piece, every card is fantastic. The money is beautiful and heavy, the game board is thick and sturdy.  The artwork is just, well, shiney.  I am a huge fan of the show and now of the game, too.<br /><br />This game would scale up to 5 players easily.  When we play with so many players we add an additional opportunity to do one action (except no flying) after each round.  This helps keep the game moving without being overly complicated.  It also scales down to a single player so you can play it all by yourself which is pretty unusual for a game like this.  Nice feature.<br /><br />During the game, players are trying to complete a series of goals.  It has been our experience that the first goal takes the majority of game play time.  The subsequent goals are completed fairly quickly thereafter.<br /><br />You know you have a gem of a game when you're still thinking about it the next day...and planning your strategy for your next match.
B005ES0YA4|4|This is my second pair and they are slightly smaller than my first, but not enough that they don't fit. They are also considerably less &#34;spongy&#34; on the bottom. Still very comfortable.
B0095G5AFU|5|This is one app I use everyday.  Easy to use, cut and paste works option is my favorite. The books can be customized by color, lines or not and a few others, and has a lot of them for whatever you wish to collect. So glad I found this.
B003DS9ECQ|5|Great movie
B001NLKWLW|5|This book was chosen by our book club and it was like a mystery of a young girl's life. It was so interesting, it<br />was hard to put it down once you started reading it.  My kind of book. We will be discussing this book at our<br />next meeting.
B007N5YIUS|4|This game rocks, realy makes you think on some of the levels, dealing with gravity can be a pain some times but makes the game that much more fun.
B009G41CG2|4|Mahjong is one of my favorite games and I love this version of it.  It offers tons of different layouts to challenge myself with.
B000L9IUPM|5|I ordered the Eagles video on Jan. 17, 2010 and loved it!  The only set back was not being able to receive it in the mail until Feb. 17, 2020.  Other than that complaint-you are a fool not to buy this product brand new!
B006GHA9VQ|5|Arrived as expected
B00004YKUY|4|This is an excellent CD that has been produced with heart and soul. As a band, Journey has been able to show their integrity by making quality music again without Steve Perry. Steve Augeri has shown he has a style of his own while still showing his respect for Steve Perry. Neal Schon once again has proven he is truley one of the best guitar players ever. Higher Place, World Gone Wild, and To Be Alive Again are as good as any songs they have ever composed. Journey is a band that is alive again and doing what they do best. If your a true fan, keep an open mind and take a listen to what they have to offer.
B0091X13G2|5|We enjoy the characters, the corny jokes, definitely the action! The casting was right on the money as well and, if you were ever in uniform and had to work with some of those &#34;alphabet&#34; agencies, you are definitely told where you fall in the food chain.

B0014Z4OQG|1|Do not waste your money!!! This film totally sucked. Read all the other reviews and then read between the lines. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this movie. It might have made an interesting book, but was definitely not cinema worthy! I love a good horror movie and was highly disappointed. Blair Witch was actually better and it sucked too. I used to think BW was the worst to come out of Hollywood...but now its Cloverfield.
B0086700CM|5|this game is funnn i love playing it and the only time it ever does glich is when i have little enternet so maybe thats the prob with thos people! thanks for creating this game its my fav. :p
B00DR0PDNE|4|Easy to install. But am disappointed in the apps available for it.  However, apps will continue to be added in the future.  Chech here for available apps before you buy: [...].
B004SD5GZ4|2|In spite of the fact that I have read through the user notes more than twice, the Adobe Reader does not seem to be working on my Kindle Fire Hd tablet. Maybe it is not meant for this type of tablet but I have never been able to open any stuff from the internet with this App. Maybe I just do not get it. Please somebody help me if you know how to get this Adobe Reader App to work on this type of tablet.<br />Thanks.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is so much fun and really easy yo play, but you better be careful! You will be addicted before you know it!

B008B8AOQI|5|Exactly what I was wanting and looking for.
B003TTMFCK|5|Yes
B00TEJB8JK|4|Really mellow compared to the first album. It is quite a bit different than the first so you might want to preview it before you buy it. That being said I still really like it, it's just different.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This awesome I hope this company will make more games like this that would be the most awesome thing in the world
B004I8WD6E|5|Does everything I want it too. Stays rather clean for being clear. Isn't hard plastic so it absorbs any hard drops of scratches. Couldn't be happier.
B00A7Z8KAU|5|I first had sketchbook express, but I wanted to see what sketchbook pro was like. So I got it, and it was worth getting. It has 161 brushes, counting the smudge tool(for blending colors and stuff), over 200 copic colors, and up to eighteen layers, which I think is convenient. It never glitches for me, and it's useful for all artists, if you can draw or not. -)
1451629184|3|I really enjoyed reading this book but I found that I was skipping through a lot of the pages. I really didn't like hearing about all of her animals. I mean, she went on for what seemed like 40 pages about her cats and all of her journal entries about them I just didn't care to read. I know how they were a big part of her life and her sanity so I see why she wrote about them. All in all, it was a good book and I can't believe she went through what she did!
B00HCMG6LG|4|Frustrating and challenging :) I'm totally addicted and can't wait for more rooms to open up! In the meantime I will try other similiar games.
B004LROUNG|5|Very clear overview of law and qualities u don't want in a lawyer. The characters are interesting and kept me in suspense.  I have always been a fan of this author. Good job.
B004J5366M|5|I stumbled upon this album and am glad I did.  I absolutely love his voice and the lyrics move me. I can't wait to see what he does next. I'm an instant fan.
B00BAXFECK|5|What a great book! I don't think I can compare it to anything else I've ever read. The cast of characters is superb, and one is engaged in the story from the first page. The main character is a real person. He is flawed but not in a way that would adversely affect the reader. There is a tone of honesty in the book which is refreshing, compelling and frightening. It's a story of a young man's journey from tragedy through adversity and ultimately into a place where he can hopefully survive, and  is definitely worth reading.
B005LAIHXQ|5|Im a huge sci-fi fan and i thought that this show was great.  A trilogy or a sequel is a must.
B003BLXKK2|1|The story was boring and draggy.  A cheap ripoff of better, stylish action films of the past.  The Julie Benz character annoyed me from the moment she entered the movie.  Then some fat guy in a speedo for what seemed like 30 minutes.  I had to shut it off.  Nothing interesting or original here.  Was never a fan of Boondocks 1 either.  These movies also run way too long.
0316228532|5|I purchased \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" last night on my Kindle Fire.  As a student, I don't have a lot of spare money for books and the price was slightly deterring, but I grew up with Harry Potter and absolutely love JK Rowling's writing, so I decided to go ahead and buy it. I have experienced no problems at all with the format of the book; the Kindle Fire offers 8 different font sizes, and I have been reading this book at the second smallest option.  So, price and Kindle format both were essentially non-issues for me.<br /><br />The most important thing to remember when beginning to read this book is that it IS NOT HARRY POTTER.  This is not a world of wizards, witches, and magic.  This is a very real, very gritty story told in third person, alternating between the viewpoints of a multitude of characters.  It follows the various members of a community after the death of a prominent society member - one who used his council seat to aid the poor (which caused many wealthy community members to dislike him).  Rowling has created a masterpiece of interweaving storylines, connecting characters throughout the novel and always keeping the reader interested.  Yes, this book contains profanity.  Yes, it tackles uncomfortable topics such as drug abuse, rape, and familial abuse.  But it is well-written, and it is worth reading.<br /><br />I gave this book five stars in part to counter-act the many one star reviews coming from people who have not even read it.  4.5 would be more accurate.  I highly recommend that you at least sample it - for those of you who love Ms Rowling's writing style, you will most likely fall in love with this book almost instantly.  Just remember that if you are looking for the (mostly) lighthearted magic of the Harry Potter series, this is not the right book to look at.
B00DMCV7K0|4|An historical novel based on the lives of two sisters who fought for women's rights and the abolition of slavery in the years leading up to the Civil War.  The author has embellished the facts and created an interesting read.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Great read
B00005ASGG|5|James Stewart and John Wayne are unforgettable here in what surely rank among their finest roles. Stewart is a progressive city lawyer who winds up trying to bring justice and democracy to the southwest; Wayne is a tough-talking gunman of the old West. Ford, with the help of a memorable cast that also includes Vera Miles, Lee Marvin and Andy Devine, brings incredible poignancy and sadness to this tale about America and its people in a time of change.
B00004YA66|5|OK, great movie with an original story. I still have two questions:<BR>1. After father and son change history and Dad identifys/shoots/chases away the killer, why is the killer never tracked down until the final struggle thirty years later?<BR>2. How did the father (as an older man) know to come to his son's rescue at the very end, and why wait so long? He should have moved his whole family knowing the killer was still out there.
B00AIQP9DE|5|Not far into it yet, but I am loving the creepy crazy story line! Not for young ones, or people that don't like odd things :-)
1400067820|5|Taleb captures an important idea about things that get better with use (within range), and gives it a name. The idea that the older something is (the wheel), the longer it is expected to be around goes head on with the idea the the new (Facebook) will dominate the future. The lack of a editor is obvious and distracting, but the rawness of the book makes it tolerable.
B000819PKC|3|Whether you'll be let down as well depends on which Jamiroquai you are expecting.  If you're looking for the sweet soul of \\"Emergency on Planet Earth\\", \\"Space Cowboy\\" or \\"Travelling Without Moving\\", this ain't it.  But if your favorite Jamiroquai stuff is the more uptempo dance-flavored jams of \\"Funk Odyssey\\" etc, then you'll like this.  Most of the songs are disco/synth dance tracks designed to rock a dance floor, but with not much soul sensibility at all.   There are only two songs that would sound at home on any of Jamiroroquai's earlier albums, \\"7 Days\\" and \\"Talullah\\".  Even though \\"Talullah\\" resorts to cliched \\"my girl is leaving on a jet plane and I've got to get her back\\" lryics, I've probably listened to it 20 times today because the music is DOPE.  Jay just has a way of writing songs that you can't get enough of no matter how many times you hit rewind. If you are just getting hip to Jamiroquai, don't start your collection with this album.  But if you are a long-time fan, there is enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase (Americans should wait for the U.S. release and pay the lower price - there is nothing here you can't wait a few weeks for).  Even though the album is not nearly what I'd hoped for or expected, it will still dominate my CD changer for a while.  Dude is ridiculously talented and still hasn't gotten his due.
B00VFTCGES|5|I found the movie really inspired my interest in space science, gravity and time relationship possibilities.  I was left with wanting to see more of Christopher Nolan's other work.  I was also left with a deep appreciation for Mathew McConaughey, Ann Hathaway, Jessica Chastain,& Mackenzie Foy
B005IQZB14|5|I would love to have the balls to do this!! This was a very well told account of a life event.  I felt like I was right there with her (but glad I was safely tucked into my temperature controlled, bear free, running water equipped home).
B0063GORYU|4|A frustrating game at times but I do like the challenge.  I don't think there are any instructions for the game - or i just have not seen them - so you figure it out on your own.  but I do like it!
B006WXHJNU|3|Edward Norton did a better job that Eric Bana, in my opinion. Some better effects, better story.
B004LWZWBU|5|who would have thought that a movie about bird watching of all things would be interesting. the bird aspect is good, but the story of the three main characters and what this means to their lives is well done. probably the best thing Jack Black will ever do, next to Bernie. Steve Martin is excellent too.
B00DVKOYBM|5|I find myself always wanting to play just one more game, whether I won or lost. I also like playing with courteous players, which most of the players in the games are.
B008Y7EYSK|3|The movie wasn't bad. Can't believe they've made another one though.
0452286751|2|I read this book in college at the behest of a girl with whom I was infatuated at the time. It was 1981, and she, a Polish-American conservative, was trying to save me from from my social democratic ideals, and depression, in the Age of Reagan. After I realized she really believed Ayn Rand's selfish drivel, I dropped her like a hot rock. For that, I owe Ayn Rand a debt of gratitude, for which I give two stars instead of one.    If you're young and curious about why some people can be so selfishly righteous and blind, read this book. As a cautionary tale.    As for the book itself, the stereotypes of the characters and the blatant attempt to insert a \\"philosophy\\" into fiction have been well-drawn by other reviewers. I am writing this now because America has been plunged into the Great Recession by people who tried hard to live their lives according to this dead Russian emigre's ideals.    Those ideals are easily summed up: individualism is the height of human development, extreme selfishness is the way to achieve individualism, and anything that gets in the way of selfish people achieving their goals is an evil perpetrated by jealous, inferior people hellbent on keeping the geniuses among us down.    Given Ayn Rand's background, a daughter of Czarist Russian nobility forced to flee their homeland by the Russian Revolution, her attitude is at least somewhat understandable. Unfortunately, it was seized upon by Americans who wanted to return to the Gilded Age of robber barons who railed against any regulation of their endeavors by those who believed in a common good for everyone who lived in our society. They basically scream: Government of the people, by the people, and for the people is EVIL!! It stifles individual creativity! It stifles the FREE MARKET, that great god who rewards the deserving if only given a free hand! Let us do whatever we want, whenever we want, to whomever we want, or we'll throw a tantrum!!    Like the protagonist raping the woman in this book,but, according to my would-be girlfriend of long ago, a \\"good rape\\" because it set her free of her horrible collectivist and socially responsible convictions. Like the greedy traders of Wall Street and the fixers and flippers and mortgage lenders of the subprime real estate market, who raped our economy for their own short term benefit. Like the health insurance industry profiteers, who claim that any government run plan is inherently inferior on the one hand but is in fact so insidious on the other it would somehow drive them out of business if allowed to exist on a level playing field.    Like the people who look down their noses at the less fortunate as \\"losers\\" who got where they were by their \\"choices,\\" never mind that most of the fortunate got their fortunes in one of the three old-fashioned ways: inheritance, luck, exploitation, or some combination of the three. Ayn Rand offers them convenient cover.    What it all boils down to is that Ayn Rand and her followers believe that the ideal of the spoiled brat should reign supreme over any notion of the common good. Isn't that what the Czar was really all about in the first place? If Nicholas II and his ilk weren't spoiled brats with absolute power, what else were they? And look what happened to them, and deservedly so.
B00BAXFECK|2|While this book had a good story, the way it was written ruined it for me. It was twice as long as it needed to be. I lost interest, skipped many, many pages. and didn't end up missing a thing!  I won't read another book by this author.
B007J4T2G8|4|Excellent book and great plot. Think Gray should have been a little older in his character. Looking forward to the movie
B000002GQL|5|This album is timeless. Classic music that will never fade. My favorites are \\"isn't life strange\\" and \\"for my lady\\". The entire cd is great music and classic Moody Blues.
B00687Q0VC|5|Educational, accurate and great acting.
B008JFUOWM|5|I already have furious 1-5 have not had a chance to see this one yet but I will, Vin Diesel is one of my favorite actors, wonder if there will be a Furious 7.....

B006G2124E|5|\\"The Help\\" is one of those films I can watch over and over.  After seeing it at the theater and about five times (so far) on TV, I cannot imagine any other actresses playing any of the roles.  All were exceptional and worthy of the many accolades and rewards they received for the film.  Emma Stone was overshadowed by some of the showier roles of her co-stars, but she gave a great performance as Skeeter.  The scene with her mother (played by Allison Janney) where the two discuss the fate of their former maid, Constantine, brings tears to my eyes every time.<br /><br />An actress other than Bryce Dallas Howard, as the contemptible Hilly, may have played the role as a one-note cliche.  But Howard's portrayal of Hilly's racism was fantastic.  At times, she seethes with outright rage; at other times, we merely see it simmering beneath the surface.  But she is always frighteningly believable.  Howard makes Hilly both detestable and pitiable; her final scene made me hurt, albeit just a little, for Hilly.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain broke out in 2011, due in large part to her role as the innocent and unaffected Celia.  Her scenes with her maid, Minny (Octavia Spencer), were some of my favorites in the film.  One can only hope that the trusting, respectful, and affectionate relationship depicted by the pair truly existed in 1960's Mississippi.<br /><br />Saving the best for last: Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis.  These two shine both individually and in their depictions of their close friendship.  Spencer earned her Supporting Actress Oscar with her feisty, fierce performance and with the best lines in the film: \\"Minny don't burn fried chicken.\\"  Davis, in the starring role as Aibileen, won a slew of awards but lost out on the Oscar to Meryl Streep.  She perfectly portrayed Aibileen's unwavering strength and dignity, even in the face of outrageously racist abuse.<br /><br />For a film threaded with racism throughout, I was surprised at how much I laughed.  In fact, \\"The Help\\" portrays humor better than many conventional comedies.  We also see the damage caused by all degrees of racism.  Obviously, there is Hilly's overt variety at one end of the spectrum which seems rooted in ignorance, fear, and insecurity.  At the other end of the spectrum is Allison Janney as Charlotte.  We never see Charlotte interact one-on-one with a black character, but I would guess Charlotte would behave with respect and kindness in this situation.  We do, however, see Charlotte succumb to a kind of racist peer pressure, and it's awful to watch.  One could argue (and I would) that Charlotte's behavior is worse than Hilly's, as her actions cannot be explained away by stupidity.<br /><br />\\"The Help\\" is one of the best films I've seen in years.  So much warmth and laughter with this exceptional cast, and I recommend it highly.\\" portrays humor better than many conventional comedies.  We also see the damage caused by all degrees of racism.

B00A81MV3U|5|What a film, what a cast, what performances, all deserved the Oscar nominations, and Jennifer Lawrence deserved her win.<br />An amazing heartfelt delve into the lives of those with bi-polar and their families.<br />As well as the required drama there is the touches of comedy that finishes it off.
1400069289|5|I'm someone who has spent a lifetime transitioning from one change through another.  Involuntary changes and voluntary alike.  Understanding how our brains use habit patterns to dictate a large portion of our daily lives was extremely interesting to me and opened a door to how I approach things in daily life.  As a former smoker (since January 1, 2009) I can attest to the frustration and temptation that habit can sometimes require we suffer through in order to learn a new way to cope with significant changes.  Somehow understanding why we have these constant triggers takes the irritation out of it a little.  Understanding how habits are formed and altered gives you more control to re-shape those parts of your life that you want most to refine.  Well researched, written in an entertaining and easy to understand manner.
B00IUBM8PQ|5|Great movie
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game gives me no problems, and it's so fun and addictive. 5/5 stars.
0061733199|5|Great book here, very informative. My boyfriend loves it!
B009UX2YAC|4|It is awesome . But it is not right . I am done with Rio and the game said come back tomorrow . When I looked today  nothing the special character is gone . And I am still in Rio... I think they should handle it..
B007IXWL2C|3|It was a fun read, and the plot is better developed here than in the first two. However, this book still has the problems of the previous two novels.
0385486804|5|just what i needed for school, came in time for the semester to start and before i needed to do all my major assignments.

B000QUUD60|5|Awesome and very factual.
B003VANOFY|4|I bought these to replace a broken 5.1 wired set from another company. At the price paid, I'm pretty happy about it, but at MSRP I'd be a bit put-off by performance.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />Fit. Very comfortable on your head, creates a great seal.<br /><br />Wireless range. I very easily go farther than the stated range and still get crystal clear reception. Big bonus.<br /><br />Clarity. Very clear and crisp and just almost warm tone. Very pleasant for listening to music, provided you take off the surround.<br /><br />7.1 &#34;Surround&#34;. For software surround it works pretty good. I've tried a few different headsets and an actual 5.1 speaker set up, and I'm starting to get the impression that positional audio has a ways to go before we even start seriously comparing digital or physical surround. Basically you can sometimes get a little more info out of the digital surround, but it's really not a complete game changer if you've been used to tracking targets in stereo.<br /><br />Battery life. Thing last a legit gaming session, that's all you could ask for. If you have to plug it in, it's really not a problem as most people have a usb handy nearby. Included cable/dock thing works well for this.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />First off, bass. As a gaming headset you're going to get a lot of low frequency booms and whatnot, and that's where this headset falls flat.  You get a lot of distortion at the low frequency end once the headset is at full volume.<br /><br />Second off, volume. These are not the loudest cans ever, and like so many headsets (and I don't see why) these will only rotate away from the user, towards their chest.  So basically unless you want to turn them over, they're pretty impossible to listen to without being on your head. My old set could be listened to from its stand if I wanted to take a break, but this set does not get loud enough.<br /><br />Software. Relatively useless, voice changing software especially just makes you impossibleto understand. Setting G-Keys is good for walking away and continuing the conversation with PTT button bound, but otherwise software is useless.
B0064MGU98|5|A very well written series, can't believe we have waited this long to watch it! We watch several episodes each night!
B004SRPXWQ|1|grandson loved it.
B00J2PB9OU|5|I really enjoyed this movie, I'm someone who read the books and really never saw the Disney Mary Poppins Movie and felt it had not captured the true Mary.  After seeing this movie however I understand much better how they came to portray her the way they did.  It was very heart warming and I especially enjoyed the end when the real recording of the author was heard. I'm not sure if the Movie was based on total facts but the story was presented in a great way.  I love Emma Thompson and think as usual she really brought the character to life.
B004A8ZX2I|5|I loooove Diane Krueger!!!, and all the action movies of Liam Neeson, its really a great movie, and also the special features<br /><br />Recomended!!
B0000CAXID|5|Dave Grohl wanted the Foo Fighters debut, which, as every punk and their grandmother can attest, was written and performed almost entirely by Grohl -- Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs contributes a guitar track to \\"X-Static\\" -- to stand on its own merits. When \\"Foo Fighters\\" first debuted, Grohl was quoted as saying, he wanted to do everything possible to distance himself from the success of his former band, to avoid the Foos being viewed as a cash cow Nirvana spin-off as so many other bands from the era were being lambasted. <br /> <br />He probably just didn't expect those merits to win him a Grammy or two and leave him at the virtual top of the modern rock pyramid. And honestly, listening to this record as out-of-context-ly as possible, it's difficult to imagine that the Foo Fighters' sound could mutate into the quintessential \\"modern rock\\" sound at all. <br /> <br />\\"Weenie Beenie\\" and \\"Watershed\\" are acidic bursts of punk charged with theatrical but, befitting the punk style, ultimately simple, guitar flourishes. It's hard to imagine anyone but the most baroquely annoying old farts claiming them to be \\"immature\\" and \\"for teenagers only\\" -- as the old saying goes, if it's too loud, then you're too old. <br /> <br />However, as with any Nirvana record, \\"Foo Fighters\\" possesses an ear for buttery, swirling pop rivaling the best the 1960s had to offer. <br /> <br />Cobain and Grohl always seemed to share a lot of the same ideas about making music. It was the little differences that set them apart. Where Cobain's instantly recognizable, cigarette-choked voice was more akin to biting hot cider, lending a punk edge to pieces like \\"About a Girl,\\" where he was otherwise belting out a decidedly Beatles-esque melody, Grohl's vocals on the poppier Foos songs are warm, syrupy and squeaky clean in the grand tradition of 60's pop. \\"Big Me\\" sounds nearly vintage, and its memorable, self-deprecating video (the Mentos commercial spoof) was a valiant way of saving face and street cred. <br /> <br />Elsewhere lie underground classics like \\"Exhausted,\\" with its comparably lo-fi My Bloody Valentine-esque lake of guitar feedback paving the way for a classic rock/metal bridge part, and the aptly-named \\"Floaty\\" which glides first on a lilting acoustic chord progression and then soars on the same chords distorted. Then there's the amped-up blues of \\"For All The Cows,\\" the \\"silly\\" song Dave always tried to perform for audiences like Howard Stern (who veto'd it in favor of \\"Everlong\\"), the George Harrison tribute \\"Oh, George,\\" the heart-thumping rock 'n' roll of \\"Good Grief\\" ... by the time you're done, you've named every song on the album as a standout. <br /> <br />Put simply, every song here does standout as unique from all the others in every way but one -- they all have the Foo Fighters sonic signature stamped proudly on their foreheads. <br /> <br />This is a classic -- the album I stack each and every successive Foos album up against. Each is good in its own way, but none of them can keep up with \\"Foo Fighters\\" and its rabid, fast-paced diversity of style.
B00005214X|5|The late George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, originally released in 1970 shortly after the break-up of the Beatles, is an outstanding album and is probably the best \\"solo\\" album released by any of the former Beatles.  The album was originally a three-LP box set (with opulent and beautifully colored interior packaging) with two LPs of \\"songs\\" and a third \\"bonus\\" LP titled \\"Apple Jam,\\" containing extended jams performed by the all-star lineup of musicians that appear on the album.  All of the music, and more, is included in this reissued set.  The original album also contained a large poster of George, which is not included here.    When he recorded All Things Must Pass, George Harrison was on a creative roll, having contributed \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" the previous year to The Beatles' Abbey Road.  All Things Must Pass (and his headlining of the star-studded benefit Concert For Bangla Desh the following year) marked George Harrison's high water mark as a solo artist, and contains some of his finest songs, including the hit singles \\"My Sweet Lord\\" (according to the judicial system, a reworked cover of The Chiffons' early 60's hit \\"He's So Fine\\") and \\"What Is Life\\" (without your love), the chilling \\"Beware of Darkness,\\" \\"Isn't It A Pity,\\" \\"Apple Scuffs,\\" \\"Wah-Wah,\\" \\"Ballad Of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll),\\" \\"Awaiting On You All,\\" \\"If Not For You\\" (a Dylan cover), \\"I'd Have You Any Time\\" (co-written by Harrison and Dylan) and the title track.  The three original LPs fit nicely onto two CDs with room for some extra songs.  The first CD contains the first LP from the original album plus five additional tracks: \\"I Live For You,\\" an excellent outtake featuring stellar pedal steel playing by the late Pete Drake, an acoustic demo of \\"Beware of Darkness,\\"  alternative versions of \\"Let It Down\\" and \\"What Is Life\\" and a new (circa 2000) version of \\"My Sweet Lord.\\"  The second CD contains the second LP and the bonus \\"Apple Jam\\" LP from the original album.The playing on the album is first-rate.  The album contains a virtual who's who of backing musicians, including: Derek and the Dominos (Eric Clapton, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle and Bobby Whitlock); Ringo Starr, Billy Preston and Klaus Voormann (the Beatles contingent); Gary Brooker (of Procul Harem); Alan White (later to join Yes); Phil Collins (later to join Genesis); Pete Drake; Dave Mason (on leave from Traffic); Badfinger (including Pete Ham); Bobby Keys (Rolling Stones sideman); and others.               This Phil Spector produced album features Spector's famous \\"wall of sound\\" which permeates the album.  As George notes (apologetically) in the liner notes, the sound is a bit dated, but at the time it suited the songs well.  The CD remastering is excellent; this is one case where the CDs may actually sound better than the original LPs.       The packaging of the original version of this CD reissue was really nice.  Originally this set (the version I have) was offered in a mini-box replica of the original album, with a colorized version of the original black and white album cover.  The mini-box contained individual sleeves for each of the two CDs with alterative versions of the colorized cover, and a nice booklet with an essay by George, some cool photos, the lyrics and information on the artists appearing on the album.  The set is now offered as a digipak; I am not familiar with the newer packaging.  (Apparently, Amazon offers both the mini-box and digipak versions of this release.  If you purchase this set, I'd recommend picking up the boxed edition if it is available).                In short, this is a must purchase if you are into the Beatles and/or George Harrison.
B001EYU1VO|3|It seems that if you want a decent joystick below $100 you are very limited on<br />your options.  This joystick accurate and certainly not sloppy, but you will find<br />that the handle body is rickety and not as solid as I would like.  when you twist<br />the handle for rudder function you can feel the entire body flex.  Also, the base<br />does not lock open so if you move the joystick while on the desk you risk having<br />the base close (the throttle base and right side &#34;wing&#34; collapse).<br /><br />It's a nice stick to take to lan parties due to being able to break it down to a packable<br />two piece stick.  System wise I like the way it works... don't like the build quality however.
B003O86FMW|5|A cut-off ending that leaves fans \\"hungering\\" for more! . . . . . . . . . . .
B008XG1X18|5|GREAT!
B006MW3UZW|5|The history is fascinating.  The various story lines within the show are well-written and captivating.  I have a hard time stopping at one show per night yet I certainly don't want to get caught up either.
B007SGLZP8|5|Thoroughly enjoyed this book; John Grisham rarely disappoints. Though I wanted to finish the book to find out<br />\\"who done it\\"...I also didn't want it to end.
0345350499|5|I loved the new spin Bradley put on the old Arthurian legends.  This was a wonderful book.  I recommend it highly to anyone who likes to read about King Arthur.
B0053TMP24|3|bit disappointed with this book. I liked book one, but book two took me soooo long to finish. I wish I had more time to really dig deep into what I didn't like and what held me back, but the truth is, when I give three stars, I don't waste time on the reviews. Four and five stars get reviews, and one and two stars get reviews.<br /><br />This book was just ok. I'll try book three, but I'm not dying to read it the way I was this one.
B0000067L2|5|One of the negative reviewers wrote that this album sounds much like all of the great blues-rock albums that followed in the 30 odd years since its release. I'm making the logical reversal here - the albums that followed all sound like Disraeli Gears.  Cream along with Jimi Hendrix virtually invented rock as we listen to it today, and this album is a blueprint.  Watch the Classic Albums DVD if you have ever dismissed this record.
B00AIQP9DE|5|Very good and fun game. I really enjoy puzzle mystery games and this one is one of my favorites.  :)
0804139024|5|When a storm hits Mars, the crew of the Hermes is forced to abort their mission without fellow astronaut Mark Watney, who they believe was killed during the storm. Alive and stranded, Watney must use every ounce of resilience and strength to survive. Balancing technology and a thrilling storyline, The Martian is an intense and riveting story of endurance. —Jenn Lawrence, Bloggers Recommened

B0063IH60K|4|Breast game for free. Haven't seen a way to get rid of the advertising. Worth a couple of dollars to remove it.
074356619X|2|This book is not without predecessors. The Secret, however, makes the mistake of reappropriating various historical figures to its cause by quoting them out of context. The law of attraction has a history of its own, but the concept that it is science is something new (and outlandish) that I first encountered within this book. I rarely, rarely give negative book reviews, but I sincerely recommend that you choose not to read this book. There is happiness, power and hope elsewhere. This book is full of positive energy, but that energy is ungrounded and unstructured. Imagine 6 hours of people talking vaguely about their own success in terms of energy, mindset and power without tying those concepts to concrete human behavior.
B006VFLIYK|4|I always enjoy David baldacci. Very entertaining, fun to read, and unpredictable. I also love that Will robie is not 20-something and does have a heart even if he is an assassin. You will have to finish the book if u start it!
B00B22ASUM|5|Very real and inspiring. Such a sweet story showing the great companionship between a man and his best kitty friend.
B000FC1HQY|4|I grew up in West Africa during and right after British colonial rule, so I could relate to much of what the author expressed in this memoir. As another reviewer has said, the writing style can be off-putting, but nevertheless it is a story well worth the time and effort. This author's parents are extremely dysfunctional and the fact that she has come out the other side with this kind of talent and ability is nothing short of astonishing.

B0088W6IMQ|5|Provides an alternate and probably true depiction of our planets history, makes more sense than our history books. I'm obsessed with this show, I find the acting top notch as well. Hopefully star gate never ends!!!!
0792151712|2|This is a great effort and has good special f/x and design, although the price to make the movie could feed the world for a few centuries.  The plot is, well, let's just say down-right watered-down.  The movie tries to be an emotion filled drama but to me, came out only as a corny attempt to make me cry.  The director is awesome, but the storyline is the only problem.  The storyline is the reason why I deducted three stars.  I saw this movie in theaters.  While 20% of the people were crying, mostly insecure teenage girls that were just dumped.  I on the other hand, feel asleep after two hours and woke up when the ship was sinking and laughed.  A good use of a pool and make-up, poor use of money, a slightly worse than poor plot.
B00005JMJ4|1|Stay away, stay far away.  Nothing to see here (literally).

B000020617|2|I love dear ol'Bon Jovi - sometimes, but this time I was going to buy Foo  Fighters. Something went wrong, however.<br />That's not bad that we had that  heavily overplayed radio hit called Learn to fly. That's great we got that  MTV's piece of art named Breakout. Everybody including myself must have  felt happy about this new the foos' album. Has it met all the expectations?  It hardly could - for one simple reason: everybody still remembers The  Colour &amp; The Shape, and everybody is rather still sure there was much  less sugar in it.<br />Too poppy may not necessarily mean too bad, it is just  too sweet which still attracts the real fans of the foos (how much sweet  should it be to disappoint all of them?)<br />As for the tracks, no need to  talk about the above mentioned hits. Stacked actors, Headwires, Gimme  stitches, MIA and even Next year are really something - considering the  rest of the staff on the cd. They are good, and - of course sweet, and  nice, and poppy, in short, you have a big chance to love them, and even  other songs, - in case, if you are not too conservative about the  foos.<br />Everybody has a right to be commercial. The foos used to be  commercial their own way. Now the way has changed. I'm afraid of their next  album.

0140120416|5|My favorite Russian book.
B0000025D0|4|A Springsteen classic, but not in the larger pop/rock world. Two other Springsteen albums have that honor, Born to Run and Born in the USA.  Darkness is an important album because the characters  that inhabit Born to Run, trying to find a place &quot;to walk in the sun&quot; wind up working in auto shops (Promised Land), racing cars (Racing in the Streets), driving aimlessly (Something in the Night).  The romantic notions of Born to Run give way to life's realities and Springsteen starkly portrays them musically and lyrically. The characters find out it is not so simple as to want to runaway and live happily ever after, but they discover that they have to fight for their hope and faith (Badlands).
B00HGJ18C2|4|This is a good memory exercise
B00000G3PA|5|FUNNY AS HELL
B000CCBCAS|5|I absolutely love this movie!  It is hilarious, uplifting, has a great cast of characters, and teaches about love in general.  I love the sets, the flowers, and the entire comedy is timeless.
B001CIPU3G|5|Their is not much else to same about shogun besides they take their fcuking heads!!! Its trivium best work for sure top everything other cds they have done. Shogun Is so heavy but had has this really cool shadow of it that's so mellow and relaxing, same time and builds of mixes of being just pain heavy metal to siht we never heard before. Their is nothing out their not comes close to what shogun delivers ! A turn classic of or time!!
B00004RJ71|5|Excellent movie. I've seen this movie a couple of times before, but never purchased it before. I'm glad that I purchased this movie because I watched it last night and just realized that one of the actors wrote the screenplay for this movie. I think that's what makes it an excellent movie. I highly recomment this movie.
B001AW9DKK|2|It's rather comical, leaving Neil in charge. The Barney Fife of CSNY does it again. He's been adrift aesthetically since David Briggs passed, and his errant judgment cuts across every aspect of his career, save PRAIRIE WIND and MASSEY HALL. What is on offer here is a very unrevealing cross section of some, and mostly his, songs from the Freedom of Speech tour. I caught the show in Hershey and this disc fails to capture the impact and power of the performance. How in the world you leave off OHIO as it segues into OVER AND OUT I'll never know. In the course of the concert, it was the single most effective 9 minutes of music that this group has ever done. It hit the crowd in the heart and it brought home exactly what has transpired in America over the past 28, and especially the most recent 8 years: a decimation of the US Consitution in the name of greed fueled by xenophobic intollerance and jesus whipping. A fallen empire on its knees....  Don't take my say so - look at Russia's current actions: Putin is fully aware of the impotence of W and his puppetmaster Cheney and sees an opportunity to arouse the Russian bear and re-invent totalitarian influence. W is too busy with Olympians gone wild in the volleyball sands, and a tied down military in the oil sands. God help you if your criticism gets heard.  That's what this tour was about, but a single CD edit of the many powerful performances by Stills (God Bless him, even as he battled cancer), Crosby (still the philosophical and political brains of teh outfit) and even Nash (whose performance transcended his usual hippie-cloyingness) would give you the impression that they were just along for the ride. Not so. But you start to understand why they get pissed at Ol Shakey. This isn't even as good as some of the bootlegs I have heard from this concert tour, so I would advise you to skip it, and hopefully the DVD will restore the integrity of the entire performance. It is better than TIME FADES AWAY, which again was a disaster as a document of a tour that, at least in Philadelphia, was the best live Neil Young concert I have seen or heard, ever.  Of course, who knows, maybe he is saving the good stuff for his massive Archive release on blu-ray (what on earth is the wait for a guy who uses first takes to commit his ouevre to blu-ray?). Hey, hey, my, my....
B005FITIDC|5|First of all, I thought Relativity did a horrible job in the PR of this movie...I can't figure it out. The story is compelling and the best part is...it's a true story. The cast members do a terrific job. Gerard Butler is at his BEST in this..A must see...especially now with the Joseph Kony story being broadcasted everywhere..<br /><br />A story of One Man's War...his despair which turns around through faith and helping the children of South Africa. Sam Childers, God Bless you ! This is a story that everyone needs to see...When watching the Oscars this year, this is one movie they missed...
B006LSZECO|4|Well written and a real page turner.... It really makes you think about who is in your own life and who among those are truly psychos
B005LAIHXQ|5|Have seen twice in theater already and can not wait for the dvd release. I picked up a blu ray player just for THIS film. It is amazing visuals, great cast, great story, great everything. If you are a fan of the alien films than go see it. When I watched it the first round I didnt take to it so much but on second viewing....wow. When going to watch just enjoy the film. Dont try and tie together the films, thats the mistake I made when first watching. Just sit back and watch. It will hit you days later craving more.<br /><br />Best film I have seen in past 5 years maybe longer. Side note: Noomi Rapace is the star of this show. I fell in love with her after this film. They could have made this film 4 hours long and with her as lead I would keep watching with no problem. She is an amazing lead, and they were smart to pick her. Blows Ripley away and then some. Perfect film. Dont listen to the haters, their mind couldnt understand it just like Blade Runner.

B00MILGR6A|3|It had the potential to be so much better. I probably wouldn't have picked Megan Fox for the role of April O'Neil for starters, and there was far to much focus on her character and not enough of the turtles for which the movie was named. The action and humor between the turtles was great and could have carried the movie further if they had focused on that instead. I also did have some issue with the design of the turtles. Something about them was just... off. Lastly &#34;character development&#34; (I use this term loosely) was shallow and rushed. Good enough movie if just looking for something goofy to watch but I'll stick to the original movies for now.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Oh the tales we weave. What an incredible story and the circumstances unfortunately could be any one of us. We never know what twists and turns our lives can take in moments of passion or anger or love. Circumstances change, decisions we make can affect not only our own lives but lives that are around us. This was a compelling and emotional story, I loved the book.
0060930349|4|I am an unabashed  admirer of Howard Zinn, but I am tremendously impressed with Paul Johnson's A History of the American People. I read this book while attending graduate school, years after reading Zinn's fascinating People's history of the United States. Johnson's interrogation of the polemic characters, social movements, and various ideologies provides readers with a brilliant but conservative perspective that is trenchant and well-detailed. Although I consider myself a moderate liberal, I was intrigued on how Johnson describes certain historical figures, For instances, unlike Zinn, Johnson reveres business potentates, such as Rockefeller and Drew, for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century. He is exceedingly critical of Thomas Jefferson, but he adulates Andrew Jackson for his gallantry during the Battle of New Orleans. I recommend students, scholars, general readers, and history buffs, to read this thought-provoking book with Zinn's People's History to procure a well-balanced understanding of American history and the people and ideas that shaped this great nation.             <br />

B0085OF4GS|4|While the movie is still very funny, it just doesn't attain the status of &#34;Classic&#34; like Airplane and the Police Squad trilogy do.  Some of the bits seem overly long and forced; and it lacks the gag upon gag that make the others so fast paced and hysterical.  It is, however, still a very funny movie.
B0000640VO|4|I found this film witty and intelligent, encapsulating French culture and humour. It shows the beauty and joy that can be found in helping others, as well as the benefits of courage and coming out of your shell. It's a nice break from typical hollywood films. A film is not a bad film because it fails promote American idealism. I think it's a great film, even if it doesn't try to capture the audience by big explosions, sexy women or popular culture.
B00BOTCJXC|4|Parade’s End takes four of Ford Madox Ford’s novels and turns them into a miniseries written by Tom Stoppard.  Some have characterized this as ‘the thinking person’s Downton Abbey.’  That is really not fair.  Downton’s canvas is wider and its ensemble cast is much larger.  Its time period is also more expansive.<br /><br />Parade’s End is much more like a (wartime) Henry James novel.  It examines the experience of a love triangle: Christopher Tietjens (Benedict Cumberbatch), his wife Sylvia (Rebecca Hall) and a young suffragette, Valentine Wannop (Adelaide Clemens).  While Sylvia is unfaithful to Christopher he cannot bring himself to embrace Valentine because he is a married man and an Edwardian man of honor.<br /><br />Thus, the story concerns a dying breed and historical/cultural change.  The tension brought on by Sylvia’s behavior and Christopher’s reactions is palpable.  He is simply too good to spurn, embarrass or divorce her and she is too passionate and vital to accept this honorable treatment.  She would prefer that he exhibit the same sort of passion which she possesses and scream and throw things.  Thus, the conflict and drama are accelerated not just by actions and choices but by codes and mores.<br /><br />This is a ‘quiet’ kind of drama but a very powerful kind of drama, with thin-lipped smiles and heads that are about to explode.  The key, intervening outside event is WWI and it is deleterious to the story, not because it is inconsequential to the story but because it is dwelt on for 2 of the 5 episodes.  Trench warfare is nearly unwatchable.  Sloshing through water and mud with incoming shells bursting overhead and machine gun fire prohibiting views of the horizon and a wider world turns 40% of the story into a slog.<br /><br />It is still a wonderful story with (Spoiler) a satisfying ending, but the story’s third act undercuts the first two.  The dvd’s include an interview with Tom Stoppard.  This is interesting, but note that it is recorded but not filmed.  While TS and his interviewer speak we continue to look at a still photograph.<br /><br />I recommend it for both the performances and the basic plot arc.  It also includes work by a number of Britain’s great character actors.hat it is recorded but not filmed.

B000127LW2|5|Voyager is the only Star Trek series from which I have not missed one single episode when it was aired.<BR>At last, now it is coming to DVD. I can't wait until February 24th. I'm really looking forward to seeing all the extra features.<BR>If you are a Trekkie, you must own it. I plan to order all 7 seasons as soon as they become available.
031606792X|3|I got introduced to this series by a friend of mine that teaches high school.  All of her students were into it.  I teach elementary school and I also have 2 teenagers, a daughter and a son.  I think I related to this story more from a parent's point of view.  I really liked the first 3 books, although I did see the criticisms that others saw and articulated.  There were some abusive tendencies, Edward was controlling and Bella did wrap her whole life around a man.... still, I liked it til the last book.  I was sooooooo disappointed!  In fact, I have never written a review or even read reviews much.  Generally, If I disliked a book, I sat it down and that was that. For some reason , this time, it bothered me.  I was really looking forward to Bella maturing and growing up some and that didn't happen.  I felt like she solved all of her problems by becoming a \\"Cullen\\". I had questions like...  1. Why did Edward have to \\"buy\\" her way into Darmouth?  Hadn't she been in advanced classes? Wasn't she smart enough to get accepted into a good school? Couldn't she have gotten a scholarship to pay her tuition? Perhaps this would have been a good time for Bella to introduce Edward to a great concept known as \\"earning your way\\" rather than getting everything you want by being gorgeous, rich and manipulative.  2. If she were so clumsy and accident prone, how did she get through life all those years w/o Edward running interference?  One would think this girl was not capable of going to Walmart by herself.   3. Wasn't Bella capable of picking out a prom dress, wedding dress, honeymoon attire etc. without Alice having to do it for her?    4. Why did they always consult with Edward's family about major decisions, but not with Bella's?  Weren't her parents intelligent and caring too?  She never gave Charlie a chance.  In fact, I think the best advice that she got in the whole series came from her father. He told her after Edward came back that she should have a balance in her life andnot allow him to become her whole life again.  She did not take his advice, but it was very, very good advice.  Wouldn't her parents care enough about her that she could tell them about her future plans?  Afterall, if Edward could trust Bella with his secrets, couldn't they trust her parents too?    5. Didn't Bella have any talents before she became a vampire?  I mean, Edward was a gifted musician, he could dance like Fred Astaire, he spoke Spanish fluently, He was at the top of his class, He was the fastest runner in his family and had self-control like only Carlisle.  In fact, he helped Carlisle in his practice.  He delivered Bella's baby and came up with the idea of injecting his venom into her heart versus biting her.  Couldn't Bella sing well, dance well, write well, was she good in photography???? Something!!!!  That part of her character was not developed until she became a vampire.   6. And lastly, wasn't Bella already beautiful before she became a vampire? Wasn't that what attracted Edward to her in the first place? He had been around beautiful vampire women for decades, but didn't find them attractive.  He was attracted to Bella because she was smart, caring , funny, insightful etc. etc.      I don't want to be overly critical because I realize that it's just a book.  It's not supposed to define the next generation.  It was written to entertain.. and it did that.  I was just disappointed in the ending. I didn't like the way she changed the characters.   I wanted Bella to find the beauty in herself and see that she was wonderful just the way she was and Edward was equally as lucky to have her in his life.  Instead, I felt that her problems were solved by making her a cullen- complete with designer outfits and Ferraris.      I also thought she made total wusses out of the men in the story.  Jacob was smart, funny, handsome and good with his hands.  Bella's a great gal, but she's not the only fish in the sea.  Surely there are other girls in their area that would appreciate a great catch like Jacob.  I hated watching him turn into this big desperate wuss!  ... and that imprinting stuff--creepy!  I was so tired of Edward in agony and moaning-- get a backbone Edward!!!  and lastly Charlie- who was sensible, and responsible and who has dealt with crime and behavior as a police officer for years... \\"Don't tell me anymore than I need to know\\"-- What?????     Last comment, that baby stuff was ridiculous and way over the top!!!  Couldn't Bella have just had a difficult pregnancy and perhaps had to stay on bed-rest??  Did we really need all that blood and gore?        Thanks for allowing me to vent!!!

B00003CWTI|5|Okay, this film deserves 4 stars, but I added one for the supplimental stuff on the second disc--which was a nice treat and is well-worth watching. And I'm also proud to say that I'm a fan of Mister Anderson's work (do yourself a favor and check out &quot;Hard Eight&quot; and, of course, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;) and his story-telling-sytle.  Here he's got a collection of interesting characters and circumstances, and much praise to Tom Cruise for forgetting self-image (I know you want to be known as a &quot;nice guy&quot; Tommy, but you're an actor) and for the emotional depth of his performance which was quite stunning to watch (was he panting like a dog in one scene? Interesting!). And much more praise for character actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman--he's outstanding in mostly everything he does.  But the characters don't quite make the connection it was intended to make in the end. Redemption comes in the form of a Biblical downpour of frogs, which is creative and Oh-My-Gosh incredible, but it does not full achieve closure to those souls that had lost themselves.

B0011UJMK2|5|This book had me sitting on the edge of my seat throughout every chapter. In fact, I was so addicted to the book, I ended up downloading an Audible version as well so I could listen to it on my daily commute to work. Anxious to see if the movie does it justice and am looking forward to reading the next two in the series.
B0000787FH|4|There's not a whole lot to add to the previously posted reviews. In spite of Columbia's audacious \\"Masterpiece?\\" ad campaign at the time of the original LP's release, Imperial Bedroom is probably worthy of being called a masterpice. If nothing else, it was dramatically different from just about everything else that came out in 1982.<br /><br />The sound quality of the Rhino reissue is perhaps a tad fuller than the Ryko reissue, but the differences are mostly subtle. The extra bonus material mostly serves to illustrate why the \\"alternate\\" versions didn't make the album, though it's great to finally be able to hear the sped-up version of \\"Man out of time\\" that survived as the intro and outro of the album version.<br /><br />Oddly enough, even the expanded liner notes don't reveal too much more than the notes for the Ryko edition, which were already longer than those Costello penned for most of the previous Ryko reissues. Still, if you've got the Ryko reissue of Imperial Bedroom, the new liner notes do make a good case for picking up the Rhino edition.

B0000027RL|5|The early 90s was the perfect time for grunge - most of American youth was sick of everything else, from music to politics to the baby boomers themselves. Then along came the Seattle music scene, out of which emerged a gritty, dirty, punkish, slow kind of raw rock 'n roll that we have all come to know as grunge. Out of grunge emerged a countless number of bands - many terrible but some fantastic. Along with Nirvana and Soundgarden (as well as Sonic Youth, Alice in Chains, and Stone Temple Pilots to some extent), Pearl Jam emerged as one of the most important grunge bands to hit the mainstream. <br /> <br />Ten was the album that exploded them onto the scene. At times it can spit in your face, kiss you on the forehead, and send you spinning into the clouds all at once. One of the few rock albums without a bad song, Ten is on a level all by itself. While Nirvana was the pop-punk side of grunge and Soundgarden was playing around with unorthodox guitar riffs, Ten was quite simply rock 'n roll (and grunge) at its best - pure, emotionally-driven hard rock with intense vocals and mesmerizing guitar solos (in particular the solo in \\"Alive,\\" in my opinion among the greatest of all time), and heavy, powerful bass and drums. <br /> <br />Eddie Vedder's long vocables and screams, such as those at the end of \\"Jeremy,\\" are just as haunting and poetic as the actual words, giving Ten more flavor, lyrically speaking, than anything else Pearl Jam has done. And the way the chords progress, like those in \\"Even Flow,\\" \\"Once,\\" and \\"Black\\" (which even uses piano), grind into your ears like an animate jackhammer. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most underrated track on the album, \\"Release,\\" is a beatiful ending that will send you spiraling into the ocean and rescue from drowning at the same time. <br /> <br />Setting all historic overtones aside, and disregarding the rest of Pearl Jam's long, up-and-down career, Ten is nothing but an amazing rock record.

1476751447|5|This is a great biorgraphy of Secretary/Senator Clinton's time in the public eye!  She is truly one of the brightest women our country has ever produced.  We should be proud that she has devoted so much of her life to public service.  Hard Choices was a perfect name for the book.  I think every person who reads it will be able to identify with the title and why she chose it.  I hope she runs for the White House in 2016 and wins!  She would be a great president!
B0002O06N0|3|This album is for the most part rather catchy.  I think the lo-fi sound is perhaps just too lo-fi.  Perhaps a mid-fi sound would work better for them.  I thought the songs on this album reminded me most of Tons of Sobs by Free.  It was their first record, it was better than Rubber Factory, and had better sound.  Having said this, Free are no more and I still like that early sound so the Black Keys are worth a listen.
B00005LOUQ|5|LOL good movie is all I can say. Very funny classic! :) Christmas movie that will never get old! My daughter loves it!

0321012542|5|Bevington's edition is by far the best Complete Works of Shakespeare available today. Why? First and most important, the footnotes give you just what you need to understand the play and no more. They're complete, concise, and accurate. The formatting of the footnotes also facilitates their accessibility. Second, the introductions to individual plays are marvelous--they get right to the most important critical issues that make reading the plays interesting, without being vague and out-of-date or pedantic, overly concerned with trivial minutiae. Third, the background essays are excellent and up-to-date. The essays on &quot;The Drama Before Shakespeare,&quot; &quot;London Theaters and Dramatic Companies,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare's Life and Work,&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare's Language&quot; are among the best available anywhere, complete and concise, giving you exactly the information that is needed for studying and appreciating Shakespeare in the 21st century, without bogging down in unnecessary details. Consider also Bevington's The Necessary Shakespeare, which uses the same footnotes, introductions, and background essays, but includes fewer plays. It's possible to quibble with some of the editorial decisions, but unless you're writing a Ph.D. dissertation on Shakespeare, students and aficionados will want a good &quot;reading edition&quot; like the Bevington that includes the important variants. If you really want a completely &quot;authentic&quot; 17th century version, folio reproductions are now widely available.
B00AIQP9DE|5|This game was awesome! it was totally worth the $5. was long but kept me interested. I even got lost in the game a few times.
B0089EHWQE|5|This is one of the best  books I have read this year.  A very poignant story about a quadraplegic and his relationship with his care giver who become more than that to him.  His decision about his condition and how it affects those close to him is well written and sweeps the reader along to the very end.  I wish the author would write a sequel to this book.  Hard to put down and to forget after reading it.  Loved it!
B000002IZ4|5|Nothing like their 1992 release with Core but equally as good, the distorted riffs are toned down on this album and Weiland sings in a totally different style, a true testiment to his abilities as a vocalist, often agreed by many to be their best album, Purple is an alt-rock classic and one of the most creative records of the 90's, songs like Vasoline and the always amazing Interstate Love Song, which everyone likes, fan of the group or not remain radio staples today, even the lesser known songs easily could have been singles. How the beautiful \\"Still Remains\\" never became a single will continue to baffle me
B000002KAT|5|It was 1977. My brother bought me this album (on vinyl) for Christmas. Just sort of...of the cuff.<br />It changed my world. This was not nostalgia. I didn't even think about the release date. I dropped the needle and there it was. Perfection. Whatever that is.<br />This record will change your life.
B005OCFHHK|4|I love this story - many people do.  The Blu-ray collection looks to be compiled from previously released 2-disc sets of each individual chapter.  I wish there was a 9th disc that had the details on the 2nd discs of the individual chapters.<br /><br />The video quality is utterly amazing.  This is one of the best HD renderings I've seen to date.  Excellent color saturation and luminosity.  The quality is so good that it overtakes the most annoying downfall of some of the chapters... the sound mixing.<br /><br />Sound mixing is a post-production effort that, among many other things, applies volume to desired levels for each of the elements of a film including special effects and dialogue.  It is painfully obvious that the mixing engineer liked the special effects more than the dialogue - especially in the 5th and 6th chapters.  I had to turn off surround sound in the 6th chapter and verify my audio settings because of the inept mixing.  The dialogue audio is extremely quiet when separated out into its own channel on surround on these chapters (it is quiet in other chapters as well, but these 2 are the worst).  To hear the dialogue I had to turn up the volume significantly.  But then when the special effects kick in, the volume is disproportionately harsh.  I get it - explosions are louder than human voices.  But in film - moreso for family films than Rambo-like films - it is traditional to tone down the explosions and tune up the dialogue to balance the audio.  Not here though.  Just beware that this is the case and hold the remote at the ready!<br /><br />Aside from that annoyance, the collection is wonderful.  A must-buy for all HP fans!
B00G2GMRCU|5|All Baldacci books come with the same quality in story telling.  I don't think you can go wrong with a Baldacci book.
B0000AQVCL|5|I like this one...but the only con is that they have the good radio hits, but the rest of the songs aren't that great. Jet rocks - that is why I bought the CD. A good choice, just make sure you like the big songs...the rest are just like them. I rated it with 5 stars because it is an album wonderfully done, take a close look at the lyrics they are actually meaningful and are something to sing to and think about. And Jet's talents are great. It's either a love it or just dont quite like it that much CD. If I were you I'd buy it, but keep the stickers and receipt just in case.
B0012BTBQU|3|Like many others, I came to this this book because the author has been selected to complete the Wheel of Time series following the death of Robert Jordan. Based on all the 5-star reviews I read here at Amazon, I expected a lot more. In fact, I had to stretch to reach 3 stars for my rating. The ending saved the book for me. Up until then it was not one I could recommend.     The real questions, as always, are whether I will recommend this to friends (yes, with caveats) and whether I'll follow up by reading the second book in the series (haven't decided yet).     PROS:  - a creative new world of magic  - a satisfying ending with unexpected plot twists    CONS:  - Vin and Sazed are the only two characters who are even remotely interesting, and it takes 200 pages or so for them to start being developed.  - the plot is amateurish for the first 450 or so pages.  - the dialogue and the character interactions don't pass the reality test, a fault which he shares with most other authors.    Of course, I can't help comparing Mr. Sanderson to Robert Jordan, and that's unfair to a young man writing only his 2nd book. Hopefully his experience in trying to get into the mind and mold of Jordan will enhance his own writing skills.

B00BIPKROU|1|The constant theme of adultery ruins an otherwise great show. The level of drama in the show is quite sufficient just dealing with the legal battles and life, so adding the relationship with the law partner is just wrong on so many levels.

B00003CXD0|4|What a tightly scripted, beautifully acted, finely paced comedy! Having seen it a long time ago, I felt it must've been very much like an older version of Mrs Doubtfire, but this marvellous film has a lot more going for it than the female impersonation angle.<br />When a failing actor cross dresses to get a job, he also discovers the inconveniences of being a &quot;woman of the 80s&quot;. Throughout the film, there's always a pleasing sense of cynical humor (e.g., &quot;I dont believe in hell. I believe in unemployment, but not in hell&quot;) and Hoffman is topnotch in his role.<br />The from Morricone has a somewhat grating refrain of Stephen Bishop's &quot;It might be you&quot; but I guess it perfectly serves its purpose, providing the touching backdrop to the actor's increasing awareness of the strength of feminine qualities -- the touch of the baby to his cheek, the poignant sight of Julie's skirt swishing in the kitchen, the offering to Dorothy of her chocolate-covered finger to suck, etc.<br />I can see that Hoffman must have committed to this movie bigtime, and I notice that there's a book that describes the making of this film but is currently out of print. Perhaps something to this effect would have been great to include on the DVD itself, which is incidentally quite lousy for such a classic film.<br />At any rate, it's a great addition to any movie collection.

B005RYDQ14|5|In English<br /><br />Crank up your volume and prepare for an adrenlin rush in the classic war movie \\"Black Hawk Down\\". This original, superior telling of a true `capture & extraction\\" mission - conducted by Delta and Elite Army troops - shows us what it takes to capture a Somali warlord and his entourage. It is as much battleground reality as most viewers can handle. The realism is so profound and the exchange of heavy fire between the calibers of war is so ear-deafening - that by the time we realize that we are on the ground or in the air - we are engulfed. We are in the flames of battle hell, and what perceptions we brought to this brilliant film: may now be altered forever. Our emotions, our sense of compassion and support to the troops (who protect our freedoms with their lives) - is now grounded in their heroism, sacrifice, hardship on and off the battlefield, and when one of our own falls dead in battle (KIA) - we are anything but indifferent. Our empathy is strong going in and coming out of the officer's call out to all U.S. military personnel within earshot:  \\"We got a Black Hawk Down. We got a Black Hawk Down.\\" We are on the ground until we `hike it out behind the armored trucks.' All unities adhered to. The crescendo is through the roof even though this is a true story.<br /><br />\\"Leave no man behind.\\" We go the distance with our warriors until we are safe and sound with a cup of cold water pouring down our face and into our mouth. Please see my future movie reviews on \\"The Devil's Own\\" and \\"The Patriot\\" when they are done.<br /><br />In French<br /><br />Couder sur votre volume et préparer à une hâte d'adrenlin dans le film de guerre classique « le Faucon Noir en bas ». Cet original, ce supérieur qui dit d'un vrai < la prise & l'extraction » la mission - dirigé par Delta et les troupes d'Armée d'Elite - montre à prend nous qu'il capturer un chef militaire somalien et son entourage. C'est autant de réalité de champ de bataille comme la plupart des téléspectateurs peuvent contrôler. Le réalisme est si profond et l'échange de feu lourd entre les calibre de guerre est si oreille-assourdant - qui le temps nous nous rendons compte que nous soyons par terre ou dans l'air - nous sommes englouti. Nous sommes dans les flammes d'enfer de combat, et quelles perceptions nous avons amené à ce film brillant : pourrait être maintenant changé à jamais. Nos émotions, notre sens de compassion et soutient aux troupes (qui protège nos libertés avec leurs vies) - est maintenant fondé dans leur héroïsme, leur sacrifice, leur tribulation sur et du champ de bataille, et quand un de nos propres chutes mortes dans le combat (KIA) - nous sommes n'importe quoi mais indifférent. Notre empathie est entrer robuste et sort de l'appel de l'officier hors à tout le personnel militaire américain à portée de voix : « Nous gotta un Faucon Noir en bas. Nous gotta un Faucon Noir en bas ». Nous sommes par terre jusqu'à ce que nous < le va à pied hors derrière les camions blindés >. Toutes les unités ont adhéré à. Le crescendo est par le toit bien que ceci est une vraie histoire.<br /><br />« Ne pas partir d'homme derrière ». Nous persévérons avec nos guerriers jusqu'à ce que nous sommes sain et sauf avec une tasse d'eau froide qui verse en bas notre visage et dans notre bouche.
6304712936|5|This brilliant film written by Peter Shaffer and directed by Milos Forman brings out the genius of W.A. Mozart: one of the most recognized classical composers. The film shines in all areas: cinematography, direction, acting, and costumes.        The film is based on the rumors that the court's royal composer, Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), brought Mozart (Tom Hulce)to an untimely death out of jealousy and spite. Although the rumors have little weight in history, they form a great foundation for a drama such as this film. Tom Hulce plays the childish Mozart to perfection with his spurts of laughter and giggles. Abraham received an Oscar for his role as the brooding Salieri. Supporting this great film is the beautiful music of Mozart performed by The Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-fields: Sir Neville Marinner conducting: one of the finest symphonic groups for Mozart's music.        Don't miss this breathtaking film. The drama and humor in the film are, like the music, suited for all ages. A great film for the entire family.
B000002L9J|5|This album is the greatest achievement of one of the greatest rock bands ever. There is something magic about the Smiths, and I am saying this not as a worshipping fan (since I am not one). Maybe it's the uplifting guitar  work, maybe the voice and the lyrics, or maybe the contrast between the  two. There is the fine irony and musical understatement that pervades  Smiths work--I don't know where the magic is. But I recommend a close  listening to those who still look for high-quality, non-perishable,  estrogen-free music.

0312576463|4|I just finished \\"Freedom\\" by Jonathan Franzen. It is a wide ranging two generation type family history book. Lets just say that if you settle for who you can get rather than who you want sometimes the ramifications can go on for decades, especially if your write a therapeutic autobiography not for publication describing the situation in detail. For goodness sake don't let the person you settled for get the therapeutic autobiography because then all crap breaks loose and even though the person you settled for is now the person you want, they may not want you any more and that is really bad therapy.<br /><br />And the kids, oh yeah the kids. You can really screw the kids up royal especially if they turn out to be as big a jerks as you are.<br /><br />I loved Franzen's The Corrections, and I love this book also. Not very many others did. I got my copy in the remainder bin at Barnes and Noble. Really cheap
B000AARKOO|5|Just a wonderful movie to watch... Learned a lot from this movie...The actors was so real...Was needing to get my own copy.. Thank you for getting it to me in one piece...
B000002J1L|5|Clearly building on the work on Trespass, Nursery Cryme is loaded with a mixture of long and short pieces.<br /><br />The album opens with the lush soporific &#34;Musical Box&#34; which gets downright nasty at the end. You'd really need the sleeve notes to understand what in the world is going on, but who can forget that &#34;She's a lady, she's got time&#34; couplet? Creepy and then some.<br /><br />For Absent Friends follows a pair of pensioners as they walk to church and pontificate on, well, absent friends. This song has an added poignancy forty years on. 8o) Played on keyboards with overtracked vocals.<br /><br />The Return of the Giant Hogweed closes out side one, with a demented tapped hook by Hackett in Hard Rock Mode. I remember a friend going mad trying to play this without the secret. He ended up swearing it must be a keyboard part but I've seen Hackett play it. The story is compelling and only slightly exaggerated from the real history of this plant. Gabriel mixes in some Triffid and a dash or two of IQ to make for a sinister plant enemy waxing lyrical in fine Hitler fashion of Hogweed Supremacy.<br /><br />Seven Stones opens side two with a melodic song about chance and fate with a building Mellotron-driven instrumentation that perhaps foreshadows that of Firth of Fifth on Selling England By The Pound.<br /><br />Harold the Barrel is a story of one man's nervous breakdown as reported by various people - gossiping housewives, policemen, the man from the BBC. I've always loved this one for it's wonderfully insightful look at how people can turn a tragedy in the making into entertainment. Poor old Harold doesn't stand a chance.<br /><br />Harlequin is a flute and acoustic guitar-backed song about...I haven't the faintest Idea. Fairies? I read the lyrics but I can't figure out whatinhell is going on. It's over before I can really get a grip on it.<br /><br />Finally we come to the real jewel on this album: The Fountain of Salmacis, which tells the story of Hermaphroditus, Son of Gods, who gets up close and personal with a Naiad, one Salmacis by name after a misunderstanding brought on by extreme thirst and a sheltered upbringing (well, if you foster your kid to nymphs what can you expect).<br /><br />I simply love the instrumental on this one, again driven by swelling Mellotron tones over Hackett's arpeggios that evoke ocean waves in my mind. The feel is very similar to that used in White Mountain from Trespass which I love that one too for the same reasons, but much more powerful emotionally.<br /><br />This album really marks the time at which Genesis as a songwriting and performing group found their pace and began to get traction, crafting great songs with musical depth and lyrical cleverness. Here you have the start of a three album journey - Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot & Selling England by the Pound - of a group at the height of their creativity and talent.<br /><br />Recommended.Hermaphroditus, Son of Gods, who gets up close and personal with a Naiad, one Salmacis by name after a misunderstanding brought on by extreme thirst and a sheltered upbringing (well, if you foster your kid to nymphs what can you expect).<br /><br />I simply love the instrumental on this one, again driven by swelling Mellotron tones over Hackett's arpeggios that evoke ocean waves in my mind.

B000002UCQ|4|This song alone is worth Ten times More than what the CD costs. Of course the whole CD is great ( CD # 2 is debatable ), But Isnt it a pity Has to to be the most sweetest, beautiful gorgous melodys i have heard in years. Its perfect. All things must pass confirms that George Harrison isnt and never was \\"The quiet Beatle\\". He was a talented and peaceful soul. That very soul was in every song on this CD. So, If you want to get in touch with the soul and many talents of George Harrison, Buy this CD. Its as close to his soul as you are going to get...
B005LZZMRK|5|I already know there are more than enough five star reviews for this album, but having had a week and a half to digest it, I feel like I can safely rate this.  The height of my interest in Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree occurred four years ago, when Fear of a Blank Planet was released, and then when Insurgentes came out.  At this time, I felt Wilson couldn't possibly do any better, and indeed, The Incident was disappointing.  So, the last two years, I've been listening to primarily acoustic music, and only keeping select progressive rock/metal bands in the corner of my eye.  When Grace For Drowning was announced months ago, I figured I'd like it, but I was very open to the possibility of being disappointed.  This was especially true after hearing Remainder the Black Dog, Track One, Index, and Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye before the release date.  These tracks all had pieces I liked, but they struck me as a little too abstract and unfocused.  When I received the vinyl edition in the mail, I immediately spun it.  The tracks that didn't really grab me on Youtube really spoke to me when coming from vinyl, and through my stereo system.  At that point, I knew this was a good record.  How good remained to be seen.  Three days later (a week ago), I got the deluxe edition in the mail.  That night, I listened to the 5.1 surround sound blu ray, and the quality of the sound had me in awe.  This is the best sounding music I've ever heard.  It sounds like Steven is in the room with you when Like Dust begins.  Now that I'm getting more of a feel for the structure, I'm finding that the music is brilliant.  It is abstract, but it flows perfectly.  I love the way the first disc starts especially, with no lyrics until the third track...And when those lyrics start, it sounds all the more surreal.  What makes this album truly great is the fact that it is a complete artistic package.  Besides the excellent music, and perfect sound, the Lasse Hoile-directed artwork, photography, andvideos are just as important a part of this album.  There is just so much to explore here.  Usually when I see a deluxe edition of an album selling for $80+, I think it looks cool, but is ultimately overpriced.  This deluxe package, friends, is worth the $80 plus shipping. (link to some pictures in comments.)  I will say, this is not good driving music.  The dynamic range is so vibrant that you miss all the quiet parts, and on this album, the quiet parts are the most important.  Steven Wilson has outdone himself... again.  Even though I'm listening to more Punch Brothers, Neil Young, Josh Ritter, Trampled By Turtles, et al. than anyone else, I just can't help but keep coming back to Mr. Wilson's work.
B0001AVZA8|3|This is a fun and cute comedy with a great cast and beautiful scenery, but it drags on WAY too long, and ultimately ends up as an unmemorable waste of 2 plus hours. I know I would have liked it more had it been about 20 minutes shorter. Either way, this is worth seeing for fans of Diane Keaton, who just sparkles. Jack Nicholson is his usual self, but I LOVE Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand, who unfortunately, aren't given much to do. Keanu Reeves is less irritating than in his other films and luckily, has a small role. I'm glad I saw this, but it is way overhyped by critics. The usual formulaic Hollywood romance, only this time, the ones who fall in love are old.

B00A0ABQLM|5|I purchased this unit and could not get it to work at my office.<br />Was back and forth with tech support and customer service, who even sent another new device at no extra charge. This went on for months, but Anker staff were always kind and willing to do what they could to help. (Even when I was very frustrated and blaming them.)<br /><br />In the end, a tech guy on my end discovered that our office's network configuration and switch is set up so poorly the device will not work here.  That is no fault of AnkerDirect, yet they were willing to pay the return shipping and give me a full refund. I will gladly return the second device at my expense, and will not take a refund. They have done far more than they needed to do.<br /><br />I would trust this company and their products anytime!

0345420128|4|<BR>The author gives an overview of lucid dreams, various techniques for inducing them, and advanced material on how to use them once you're having them on a regular basis....<br />The one thing that I didn't like about the book was that he gave dozens of different techniques for bringing about a lucid dream, - but didn't really explain which ones to apply and when and in what combinations.  If one isn't working how long should I stick with it, - a day, a week, a month?<br />However, just for the experience that one lucid dream was worth the price of the book.<BR>

B00127RAJY|4|No matter what Jillian Michaels DVDs rock!  She's super inspiring and she has completely changed my body in my own home!  So if you want to work out hard and efficiently....I highly recommend these DVDs.  I was a bit disappointed with this DVD - only becaue I had purchased her \\"Ripped in 30\\" DVD first.  I found the \\"Ripped in 30\\" to be a bit more relevant and up-to-date with her techniques/moves and each of the 4 workouts were equally hard.  The 30 Day Shred is definitely a progression of workouts from level 1-3 and uses old school workout techniques.  For my fitness level, level 1 & 2 were much too easy for me. But for someone who is starting out....this DVD would be fantastic.  I will continue to do the level 3 workout from this DVD during my rotation of workouts.

It's too bad this tragic star will be remembered for his controversy as opposed to his talent. Was the childhood fame and endless work worth it? he will always live in infamy.

B0082XKGGU|5|Downloaded (Free) on my Kindle Fire, and was worth every penny (yes, that's a joke...).<br /><br />Seriously, however, if you are a fan of classic philosophy, history, political science, or life in general, do not make the mistake of overlooking this collection of thoughts by Marcus Aurelius (yes, kiddies, the guy from Gladiator).<br /><br />One of the great philosopher-kings, his wisdom still applies today, and should be included as required reading for any educational system.<br /><br />I will warn, however, that the material can be pretty dry.  Not many will be able to sit down and read this one straight through.  I've found that any of the classic thinkers should be taken a bit at a time, and disbursed amongst other reading.<br /><br />Thank goodness for the highlighter built into the reader...I think I used it more in this book than any other!<br /><br />Definitely recommended.

BEWARE ALL WHO BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON BECAUSE AMAZON DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF US THE CUSTOMER!!!

B00005O3VC|5|In 1974 the bad boys of British comedy decided to create a full-length motion picture, which was destined for greatness (or at least mediocrity disguised as greatness). [[ASIN:B00000F6LQ Monty Python and the Holy Grail]] is a totally distasteful classic of almost epic proportions.  The film stars John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, and Terry Gilliam, who not only acts but also serves as the film's co-director and animator. Each member of [[ASIN:B000GEIRSM Monty Python]] is perfect in their (dis)respective roles, but standing out from the others is the late Graham Chapman, who plays King Arthur as the \\"straight character\\". Chapman portrays Arthur as a serious, heroic figure who is completely unaware of his self-satirizing surroundings.    [[ASIN:B000CRQX34 Monty Python and the Holy Grail]] begins with a series of gags involving mock-Swedish subtitles and of all things, moose and llamas. After some of the strangest credits ever, the first scene opens on an epic shot of the mist-shrouded moors of medieval Britain. Two men come galloping heroically into view. What's odd is that neither of them are on horses. In fact, one of them is simply banging two halves of a coconut shell together to simulate the sound of hoof beats. Thus hilarity ensues. The story also includes such memorable characters as an obnoxious French \\"taunter\\", a three-headed knight, an effeminate prince who just wants to sing, a ghastly cartoon monster, and perhaps the most lethal rabbit ever put on film.    What makes the film so bloody funny is the complete lack of respect that it shows to Arthurian legend and medieval folklore. Both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (the dementedly brilliant directors and co-stars) are quite familiar with medieval history and delight in lampooning it at every turn. The dialogue is perfectly ridiculous and that's precisely what makes it so entertaining.   I won't go into great detail about the plot (ha-ha-ha!) or the innumerous zany characters other than to say it's absolutely irreverent and mad (something that seems common with the Pythons). Even the ending of the film is intentionally anti-climactic.  But if you want British comedy without restraint, then check out this classic or, \\"I'll wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of secondhand, electric-donkey bottom biters!\\"  Oh, and don't forget your coconuts.    The 2-disc Special Edition includes the following special features: an audio commentary by directors and stars Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, an audio commentary by John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin, Follow the Killer Rabbit feature, Subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film (taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part II), On-Screen Screenplay, three Sing-Alongs, The Quest for the Holy Grail documentary, BBC Film Night: On Location with Monty Python and the Holy Grail vintage featurette, two scenes from the Japanese language version of the film, How to Use Your Coconuts instructional featurette, Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego short film, extensive image galleries, An Interactive Cast Directory, and theatrical trailers.

B000099T2L|5|If you are a REAL R&B lover, than you would LOVE this album! I don't know why so many people don't like it so much, it has MAD beats and Beyonce has superb vocals. <br />Crazy in Love - 10/10 A CLASSIC!! <br />Naughty Girl - 10/10 Another huge hit. Sexy and cool. <br />Baby Boy (feat. 10/10 Sean Paul) - Hot dance track, ANOTHER HIT! <br />Hip-Hop Star 9/10 - Hot song, could've been another single. <br />Be With You 9/10 - Ahh, this is where Beyonce starts showing her more R&B side. Nice, smooth, slow, and sexy track <br />Me, Myself, and I 10/10 - Hot R&B track. Meanful lyrics. <br />Yes 10/10 - Awesome R&B track, her lyrics happen a lot in real life. <br />Signs (feat. Missy Elliott) 10/10 - I love this song, I like Missy's touch. <br />Speechless 11/10 - MY FAVORITE TRACK!! THIS SONG IS SOO SEXY AND IT'S NICE AND SLOW. The best part is her ending, it's sooo sexy, I LOVE IT!!!! <br />That's How You Like It (feat. Jay-Z) 8/10 - Cool track with Jay-Z, something about the beat I'm not to crazy about. <br />The Closer I Get To You (feat. Luther Vandross) 7/10 - Probably my least favorite track. It's sounds too old for me. <br />Dangerously In Love 2 9/10 - Sweet song. <br />Beyonce Interlude (get's no rating) - just a sweet interluder <br />Gift From Virgo 8/10 - Nice lyrics, but no beat... <br />Daddy 9/10 - Really sweet song, and nice beat.   <br />To wrap this up, this album will be a classic in my CD collection and hopefully and many other peoples. Beyonce is sexy, cool, and most importantly has a beautiful voice.

B001BZ544A|5|I will never forget this love story ever! It's so real.
B0064MGU98|4|I'm almost finished with season 1 and have never watched this series before.<br />The characters have become somewhat well established at this point. The main character, (a woman!) is very inside herself and unable to express the rage and anger and betrayal she has suffered. For me, an expressionless gaze or seemingly, knowing look is not enough. Maybe this character becomes more fully rounded as the series develops. I like her but she is still kind of dimensionless.<br />All the actors seem to work well together, in their characters. And there are surprises in where the story line is headed. It feels a little soap operaish at times, but hey they didn't get this popular by playing hard to get.<br />So far I like it and look forward to continuing with it.<br />The female gum-shoe is, for me, the show stealer at this point. Big plays a dick really well, and the British guy is always great. The woman playing the #1 of the law firm is always a wonderful addition to ANYTHING she does.
B004UJ81IA|4|Nice journal of a long trek through the old southeast French countryside.<br />This book gives you the urge to get a donkey or a horse and follow-up in Stevenson's steps.<br />His account also sets you back in the middle of the bloody and savage war between Calvinists and Catholics in the south of France in the XVIII century.
B0038P59A0|5|Buena pelicula y en calidad blue ray se ve súper bien, recomiendo esta película además de los actorasos que tiene...
1847940323|5|Great book on managing change.
0765326353|5|From the unusually intricate artwork on the inside covers, to the sketches and maps heading each chapter, and obviously to the intricate story itself, this is what epic fantasy is all about.  Fans of Sanderson's writing will not be disappointed, and will again be anxiously awaiting the follow-up, as I will be.
B00021HBGS|5|These rub-a-dubs are awesome! Unlike the rubber animals that squirt water, these don't collect the mold that grows inside over time. That alone makes them a winner! Playing with my son during bath time is so much more fun and interactive! They're easy to use, there's no mess or clean up, and they come with a storage tote! Here's a tip for buyers, try to buy more than one style for added fun. They make farm animals, beach buddies, city style, and more. My son also adds regular Hot Wheels into the mix.<br /><br />For the makers: they could make the storage tote a bit larger. We have to literally cram them back inside every time and some still pop out. It only creates a slight nuisance but still. Besides, it would be nice to be able to store an extra toy or two of my son's personal favorites.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great buy and money well spent!
B006OCM0G0|3|it ok game it fun but to much pop up ads and it not free when i have no more gem i go to more gem it cost for 1000 or something it cost $99.99 so i think you can get it but not to get it.
B002APU580|5|Sadly in a post Twilight world I can't watch the scene at the first dance without thinking the characters are vampires that will break out into sparkles soon.
0634089358|5|Ed Friedland might not be the most famous bass player around but he is in my book the best bass education book writer. Blues Bass takes you step by step from simple blues lines to more complex songs. The tab is very helpful for somebody who has a hard time to read music and the play along CD really helps. As an adult in my mid 40's struggling to learn bass the help he conveys through is book has been invaluable. Yes I do have a bass teacher but working on his Ed Friedland's material with my teacher is really terrific. I have also used his \\"Bass Grooves\\" book and Blues Method 1, 2 and 3 books. All of them take you very progressively from simple things to more complex one. Many books push too many things at the same time at their audience. This author has a real talent for breaking things down into bites that are manageable. The song selection of Blues Bass is also fantastic and allows the student to learn songs that are fun to play. I should also say that it is quite extensive and it covers pretty much all the standards. This book should be part of any bass library, it's a great book for learning and it's a great reference book, who knows \\"Born under a bad sign\\" or \\"Stormy Monday\\" might be on your next play list!  Thank you Mr. Friedland for a fantastic book, you have really helped me learn the blues.
B009XIXVU6|5|Brilliant but so sad a story written by a fantastic author. I really recommend this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|This book was an easy read, and I really enjoyed how the 3 lives became intertwined. The way the author brings it all together at the end was very interesting. I highly recommend this book.
B00KWN30AC|5|Best show going! Can't wait for it to return
B00AA7O22U|4|this movie was a lot of fun, although a lot of the action was slightly over the top. Not complaining,tho!
0525423281|4|Lola and the Boy Next Door By Stephanie Perkins<br />''<br />There is something about Stephanie Perkins. What she writes is magnetic.<br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is the follow-up companion novel to Perkins' 2010 debut Anna and the French Kiss and follows Delores `Lola' Nolan, a budding teenage fashion designer whose life is turned upside down when her childhood playmates the Bell twins move back in next door. Lola is particularly stricken by the reappearance of Cricket Bell, who broke her heart.<br /><br />Lola, as well as its predecessor Anna, are chick-lit at its finest.<br />While many elements that make the work of some writers in this genre seem melodramatic are represented (drug addict mother, bad boy vs. nice guy, over-protective parents etc.), the story progresses without seeming over-stated or soap opera-esque. This book doesnt try to be sentimental or gritty. It relies on balancing comfort and warmth with excitement to engage the reader and deliver the happy ending. It does not play in to the cliches of the genre. Also, its funny.<br /><br />What I Loved:<br />The characters - not a cardboard cut-out steryotype in sight.<br /><br />What Was Lacking:<br />More pages! I wanted to keep reading.<br /><br />Quote:<br />\\"The porch is silent. I turn to Lindsay. \\"What just happened?\\"<br />\\"Your father invited the former love of your life in for pie\\"<br />\\"Yeah. Thats what I thought.\\"<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins has renewed my faith in the light-hearted fluffy coming of age novel, and I cant wait to read the last installment in this trio of companion novels, Isla and the Happily Ever After.<br /><br />This review and more at my:<br />Blog:<br />[...]<br />Twitter:<br />@100bookproject
B008MM9630|4|the game is ok. its a good way to pass some time. you are a fairy, taking care of a garden, learning magic, and taming animals. the only problem I am having is that it kicks me out of the game when I sign in with my FB account.
B000LW7LOU|5|As always, Daniel Day Lewis was magnificent in his role, and he was perfect for the story, making it very believable. The film, though tragic, was very true to the novel
B007REV4YI|5|Good movie
0618680004|5|This book is a pleasure to read. Of course Dawkins doesn't exhaust the arguments against religious belief - it would be hard to cover all the bases in a single book - but what he's done is to produce a cogent, pithy and above all immensely readable counterblast against the current resurgence of politicised religion. It's not necessary to agree with all of his perspectives - or to share his certainties - in order to appreciate the wit and perspicacity of his arguments. This book is an important element of the scientific community's ongoing counter-offensive against the wave of religious fundamentalism and new age pyschobabble that threatens to engulf us all. It arms us with some powerful debating tools, and it's a good book to pass on to your friends, especially if they're of a religious persuasion. Last but not least, if you enjoy sharp polemics this book makes for an immensely enjoyable read.
B00DC7N9NS|1|Bad acting, bad actors, bad writing, etc..... Special effects were borderline, the cracked ceramic doll was phalic, this film is for the lowest common denominator.  I feel sorry for kids that they market these type of movies to.  Watch Pippi Longstockinging, something that isn't over the top and trying too hard to be cool.  And BTW, we really don't need a backstory to The Wizard of Oz. This movie was made to employ c list actors who probably won't be around, so yeah make your money, I won't be buying it.
B009LQKHIO|4|This is a story of a young physically abused wife struggling for a new start in her recently deceased brother's home town across country from her recent home. She takes over his home along with cabins which she plans to restore and turn into a bed and breakfast. She meets and falls in love with a neighbor who helps to restore the cabins, the business takes off.  They marry and to make a long story short, all goes well and they live happily ever after. A good read for the romantically inclined, with a little mystery and intrigue thrown in.
B0090X4GLW|4|...and loved the music. I was sure to no like it but was I wrong. It is something that I will not forget and I enjoy humming the music...you will too.
B00AQO1VYY|5|Oh man. Hard to describe how good this album is. I didn't discover it until way after Layne Staley left this world. I randomly came across it and thought, 'what the heck,' I'll see if this is any good. Blew me away. Wow. While it involves members of Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam and I forget who else, it's sound is totally original and unique - completely unlike any of the members' other bands. It's rugged and raw, soulful and sweet, bitter and sad...and oh so powerful. Worth purchasing.<br /><br />Now, just a side note, this review is for the first 10 songs of the original Mad Season album. The last few songs have a different singer and you might as well not listen to them because they aren't part of the actual album (they're \\"new\\" \\"bonus tracks\\" or whatever, with a different singer). Those last few songs sound like a totally different group - one that's not very good, as the soulful sound of Layne Staley's vocals have been replaced by the bored & tired singing of someone else. Anyway, my 5 stars is for those first 10, original songs on this album. The others don't really deserve to be considered part of it.
B000YMM3CC|5|This is just a great movie that you will want to watch over and over.  Its a beautiful story and loved the actors!
B007HUD6OS|4|Very enjoyable story, though a bit unbelievable character.
B004742Y3G|5|great movie by mjfox, the previous review say's it all anything else would be an injustice. loved it my entire life.
B005URRCUY|4|My 2nd favorite CD by the Black Keys. &#34;Lonely Boy&#34; is the best on this CD. Dan Auerbach can really make his guitar talk, moan or growl.Patrick Carney has a way of creating a driving rhythmic beat with a minimalist yet essential style.
B00SH00N3Y|4|Good story but the ending was a little weak and a little too unrealistic. if someone were to re-write the last 15-20 mins, it could be an amazing movie!
B007PTJOV0|5|its awesome hes just like Mario I wish they had Mario on the kindle for free hes awesome I love it
B009UX2YAC|5|My two year old grandson loves this game.  He plays it every day.  I'm 60 years old and not good with games but this one I can play.  No one is shooting or killing anyone so it probably will be boring to some.  It's just a fun little game.
B00P77ZAN8|5|Awesome
B00CATSONE|4|A great story about a great man.  Able to create great inventions but not able to bring them to fruition.
B0091REZMW|4|love this game but don't like how you need to purchase diamonds to really get anywhere in the game unless you have a lot of patience!
0446580848|5|I have had a personal interest in the events such as the current fiction used to write this story.  DeMille has a good sense of humor and captures the banter between the FBI agent and the NYPD officers.
B00408MS5S|5|For me this is the best Supertramp album. EVERY song is excellent but my absolute favorite HAS to be 'Oh Darling'; do not confuse with the (ewww) other 'Darlin' song.. this is vastly superior and very emotional.<br />On a side note, got to see Roger Hodgson in concert last year... if you get the chance GO!!! He is AMAZING!!! I took my daughters (30 y. o. and 25 y.o.) and they also LOVED the concert. I can't express what an excellent concert it was... I'm an avid concert goer and the next best concerts had to be Three Doors Down and Collective Soul... the point being that my music taste is somewhat eclectic.
0446580848|1|I have read everyone of this man's books but this one sorely disappointed me. The plot was so overworked and there was so much unnecessary dialogue that I made it to page 300 and skimmed the rest, even the end was predictable.
B0089LOG02|4|An easy yet interesting read.  Well written.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Arrived very quickly. Very intuitive using a Chromebook and Samsung HDTV, had it set up within minutes. Watched Netflix movie and UTube videos wirelessly immediately. Very impressed with quality and price.
B000AL730O|1|I'm sitting here at my computer trying to move this CD to my IPOD. I can't. My computer doesn't even recognize that there is an audio disc in. I paid over $300 to see him in concert a couple of years back, not counting purchasing every bit of his back catalog including the Beatles and someone makes a decision which doesn't allow me to put it to my IPOD? Record company (and I am assuming artist) greed. It's a shame. Gonna return this in the morning unlistened to. How Do You Sleep Paul?
B001DJLD1M|3|I got two same DVDs of Matrix I and II, but didn't find the other one.
B00AC8ZIXO|1|Don't like it
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I thoroughly enjoyed Sycamore Row.  Never disappointed in Mr. Grisham's novels.
B003ZJJFKE|3|Joe is Joe and always good, the band is tight and plays well together. The addition of the keyboard usually provides a lighter sound and there are portions of overuse. But this is an enjoyable CD for Joe fans, the ususal stuff. Still awaiting a really breakout screamer from Joe to go the next level.
B0042RJWTM|5|this is one of my very favorite westerns ever. this is my favorite lee marvin role. the actor could relate to the character and it shows. jack palance is great in a supporting role.
0783226888|2|The only good things about this movie are Bruce Willis, Sydney Poitier, and Jack Black. And that's about it; the rest of the movie is anything but special. It's an almost worthless movie if it weren't for the three actors mentioned above. The plot had some interesting elements, but what ruins the film are pretty much everything else. Richard Gere, especially, turns out to be quite annoying and incredibly dull. The chemistry between him and Diane Verona's character didn't work at all. I almost felt like I skipping their scenes and focusing only on Willis.<br /><br />The good editing, music, and cinematography turn out to be a waste in The Jackal. I should have watched the original 1973 film instead.
B00H71PHS0|5|Captivating, outstanding.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|A very good read. Since i didn't know much about this before reading, I was a bit skeptical. The secret is a good one, and I enjoyed hearing how they coped with it, along with the other stories that all came together.
1400031567|5|book in great shape
0767805712|5|I really enjoyed the movie Gattaca which was a very good demonstration of reaching one's potential, even though all the odds are against you, and society has determined you to be invalid by birth, Ethan Hawkes was still able to not only reach his potential, but go beyond what anyone thought was possible. Just goes to show you that there is no limit in reaching your potential. Ethan Hawkes had the determination to pursue his life long dream to travel into space, with his hard work, and persistence Ethan Hawkes was able to pull off the impossible, and the motivation he displayed to stay focused, as well as his self-beliefs to not listen to negative behavior or influence from others and continue to pursue his dream, which is the foundation of success to belief in yourself and your abilities.
B00957T6X6|5|Definitely a flashlight under the blankets read till you drop series - concentrate on the sweeping story and not on the minutiae of &#34;who is who&#34; and all will become clear...and wonderful - a ripping yarn!!!!!
B0020BUWX2|5|Great book!
B003YCIE68|5|This is an epic movie from 1985 on the story of Santa Claus.  It was well put together, beautifully filmed and well acted.  And it covers a lot of ground:  from the beginnings of Santa Claus to some of his annual duties of the modern day.<br /><br />It is family friendly, much of it will be of great interest to the kids -- and yet I find it enjoyable as an aged adult.  I think there's a lot of interest for just about anyone who likes a good movie about Christmas and Santa.
B00004Z311|5|It is amazing to see how in the eighties, special effects were so advanced as to top some of today's high tech pictures.CGI and computer animation have taken over nowadays, but in most films, you can tell right away where these scenes were rendered. If you have viewed this movie however, you will see scenes, (particularly Darkness' layer) were you just have to wonder how this feat was accomplished. Ridley Scott is phenomenal at flawlessly combining the most beautiful of scenes with utterly unbelievable landscapes and characters. This is one of those rare gems, and it is hard to believe anyone would rate it at less than 5 stars. This movie is the pure essence of youth, of dreams, fantasy and light, but along with these also come nightmares, and Darkness.
B00K2CHWOI|5|Folks have written some pretty in depth reviews here, so I'll spare yet another one.  Just wanted to convey what a great movie this was.  I'm not much of a Tom Cruise fan, but this movie rocks!  It was so well written, directed, acted, and had such a great story line.  I was so focused on the movie, I would hardly turn my head away.  Tom Cruise really sold his part making his character seem so real.  The action and graphics were intense and I was surprised to see so much quick wit humor in it too.  If you're looking for a good movie, this is it!
B002MQYOFW|5|I never read books over and over this one I do!!! Great book the whole series is. Love love love.
0439023491|5|Favorite book! Came in good condition. Good price versus how much it would cost in a bookstore
B005LAJ16I|5|I can't wait for the next season to be released, yet I don't want August to get here too soon!
B00NZIIPBU|4|Great
B0035G9ABG|5|Plastic Beach may be my favorite Gorillaz album yet! It's unique blend of styles and moods are fantastic! The fact that this is also a very thoughtful album should not go unnoticed. The making of Plastic Beach DVD and the additional concept art this \\"experience edition\\" features was more than worth the extra money! A must have for any Gorillaz fan!
B003XF1XOQ|5|Great writing, a good ending. definitely worth the read. not sure which of the series is my favorite however. If you like the other ones you will like this one.
B001JAFYFG|5|Logan's Run Is one of my all time favorites, fun 70's camp. The quality of the blu-ray is fantastic even though I wish there would have been more extras on the disk.
B000FC130E|5|Great fantasy from Gaiman. Well plotted, written and executed. A good read!
B000R5N1MC|5|this was a great purchase. great commentaries by Ridley, Syd, the writers & others. some deleted scenes should of been included in the \\"Final Cut.\\" in my opinion, we will see more cuts of this film in the future.
B007THA4FI|2|The storyline was disapointing. Why do I want to read about a long list of dysfunctional families. None of the characters were any better off at the end than at the beginning. It was like watching a reality show on tv.
859037985X|5|Very clear and understandable. Excellent reference.
B009EBLCK8|5|Smart, intellectual and fast paced. the characters are well defined, and the stories are well told. My only issue - we need more episodes per season!
B00CW7KK9K|1|The strap is very poorly made.  It needs a constant heart rate monitor.  It's just a fancy pedometer.  Needs more 'elements'.  As is it should not cost over $29.95.
B00ISJT5IS|3|While I might have been tempted to go with two starts, there's an extra one because Stiller is always fun to watch.  Kristin Wigg on the other hand, seems to much of a Jennifer Aniston wannabe that she's almost distracting.<br /><br />I had two main problems with the movie:  It was very little like Thurber's short story which I felt compelled to read ( takes less than 20 minutes) after seeing the movie - and I always think that those movies that are based solely on titles are a bit of a rip-off.  Second there were the internal inconsistencies:  really, how much of an ineffectual guy could Stiller/Mitty have been, if he, at 42, could still skate board down a steep mountain side, bike and run 15KM up a volcano and then hike up the Himalayas.<br /><br />It was ok, but a bit disappointing.
0823015033|4|much detail is good for me.
B00BAXFACO|5|Without a doubt an excellent read! It was perfect. I was intrigued from beginning to end. I could not stop reading, love Lincoln lawyer series...if I could read for a living I would with Michael Connelly books! Great job MC!
B00006AG5N|5|So many love songs.  My girlfriend plays this album all the time.  So many great songs and it lasts a long time.
B00004XOWM|1|I know this has been said countless times, but I just feel like driving this very true point in further. Limp Bizkit has no talent. None whatsoever. Fred Durst's &quot;look! I know how to say the F word! isn't that so Fing cool? F this, F that!&quot; Which does only appeal to 10 year old children too heavily influecned by Carson Daily and his homies on MTV. If you want something good then look into Black Sabbath, Godsmack, Red Hot Chili Peppers and even Metallica.
B000002C1X|5|I LOVE THIS CD, I LISTEN TO IT ALMOST EVERYDAY!  iT IS PACKED WITH SO MANY MEANINGFUL MESSAGES AND ROGER WATERS IS A MUSICAL GENIUS.  NOTHING EVER WILL BE LIKE THE WALL.  THIS IS A MUST BUY, FLOYD FANS ROCK ON!
B000AM2L1O|5|I bought this baby doll a few years ago for my little girl. Now my 2nd little girl is playing with it and it is still holding up well. She still has that sweet mellow smell. Excited for my 3rd little girl to love this baby too!
B00127RAJY|5|This was my first experience with a Jillian Michaels' workout.  I'm in fairly good shape, but committed to this program every day for 30 days.  I'm already at my recommended body weight, so I did not lose any additional weight.  However, I lost 1.75 inches around my waist and about 0.5 inches on each arm.  Even better, I went from being able to do 7 &#34;girl&#34; push-ups to being able to do 30 &#34;man&#34; push-ups.  I looked better and felt great!  The levels changed at exactly the right time.  This is a must for anyone looking to get in better shape.
B009HQ9UHC|4|Figured it would be easy trying to figure these out. wrong. don't like having to pay or connect to Internet if I need help. Would still recommend this game for older kids or adults like me.
B00EOARZ4G|5|Probably Clancy's last novel.  A page turner from start to finish.  Not, perhaps, his finest effort, but very worth the read.
B00EFWU91E|5|Loved this book, and the whole series. FANTASTIC-!!! Wish there would be more about clary and have and everyone though
B004UG7RQ0|5|It worked. I was able to connect the iPod adapter cable in my car to my Android phone.  Any audio from my phone is transmitted through my car's stereo system.
B00PCKB8PO|5|Very entertaining film worth multiple viewings
B007SGM084|5|Oh WOW!  I can't say how rivetting this trilogy was!  I couldn't even make myself pause between books.  Since I got all 3 at the same time I just turned the page and started the next book.  I didn't want it to end after the third book.  I miss the characters already.  You go from sobbing in tears to wiggling in your seat to laughing outloud.  I will read this again and it will be better than a favorite old movie.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4|The only bad thing is I can put it to high graphics if you don't care you should really get this game
B00L9B7IKE|5|A real page turner. Suspenseful with lots of twists.
B007ZGO7EM|5|I use math a lot and this is the best for a basic calculator.  I also like that it shows the whole problem.  I recommend this app to anyone.
B004AGI2L4|4|I really liked this movie even though afterwards I read some articles that trashed it for historical inaccuracies. It's great action and fun suspense. Good cinema all around.
B00669MFA2|5|Love this movie ❤️
B00H2UFHBI|5|A wonderful story about what might be which brought in many philosophical ideas and meditations - a great imaginative ride
B000056HE9|5|I checked out the movie from my local county library and really liked it. Then I tried to purchase it from Amazon and it was only available from Canada. The cost of the shipping was as much as the movie so I cancelled the order.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Very addictive. Love you can play with a friend or spouse as well. The fact you can earn coins for better pool sticks etc helps you stay into it
B00K9V2OPE|5|This book drew me in right from the start and kept me reading right through to the end. The &#34;forbidden&#34; love was a sad but beautiful thing and the characters were fantastic. I loved the way the author wrote this story. So many sad but beautiful things and all written so very well. If you buy this book you won't be sorry...it truly was a great read !!!!
B005HED11Y|5|I always liked to watch this series when it was first shown on tv.  The space race was young and so wsa I.
B00004T8RK|4|Someone said this CD sounds better using headphones, and I wished them well with their rehabilitation and continued to appraise this offering as ordinary and lacking in focus. <br /> <br />Stone the crows, I slipped on the 'phones and it actually sounds really good and strangely much better.  <br /> <br />Wish me luck with my rehabilitation. No, I don't sell headphones.  <br /> <br />But \\"Evacuation\\" still sucks. Note to rights holder - remove from 50th anniversary re-release.
B00AA0TJO8|5|thanks hitcents! I could not wait till this was out! so fun. I just wish you can make more hints. I always get stuck at places, so I would like you to do that please. And please get this app its like so fun and I know you will like it too sp please get this app. You can draw everything you need like fire to blow up dymanite its so cool. please get this.
B00EHMFC78|5|Very good read. Couldn't put it down!
0425263908|1|I know everyone's taste is different but I felt this book had no substance.  They didn't seem to love each other at all just used sex as a battlefield.<br /> I want to be open minded though and plan to read some more of the author's work
B00005UNCL|5|great movie, great effects, i got this movie to i could complete the collection, good story line, wasn't the best of the series but still worth having
B005544TRQ|3|It took me a few episodes to get into it but it grew on me and Im looking forward to Season 2.<br /><br />The cast is great and the characters are compelling.
B004W89N72|4|you can keep what ever you want on here. you can put your meatings,  your birthday or other peoples birthdays.  it is a good way to stay organized
B0013USZHG|5|I JUST BOUGHT THIS AMAZING CD PURELY BASED ON THE REVIEWS OF OTHERS. I HAVE HAD IT 2 DAYS NOW AND CANT STOP PLAYING. THE ORCHESTRA IS OUTSTANDING NEVER HEARD OF THEM BEFORE THIS NOW I WILL INVESTIGATE MORE.I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS RECORDING VERY PLEASED.
B00U6SFUSS|5|The best book of my life because you could put that in your everyday life and past
1452126577|5|Along with the stuffed cat, this was the favorite gift that day for a very popular child
0689835604|5|I love this book!  It's super adorable.  The flaps on the inside make it more interesting and it really teaches your child &#34;behind, under, etc&#34;.
B00008H2LB|4|First off, Linkin Park's original sceaming-dj-rap mix is back.  That's right, Meteora is on the same plane as Hybrid Theory than it is with ReAnimation, so for those of you out there who were worried, do not fear.<br />True Linkin Park fans will love this CD, each track has such a deep meaning and there are no obscene lyrics or references to Bling-Bling as in those &quot;other&quot; raps.  That's why most people like Linkin Park--they're stuff actually MEANS something.<br />Meteora itself is loud and deals with issues affecting everyone, not just primarily teenagers as Hybrid Theory was.  Each song is individualy perfected and linked together (so no silent stops until the very end).  Tracks like &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot; are very deep, and Chester fits them perfectly.  There is only a few tracks that actually sound the same, and there is even one track that is so out of place that it strangely fits into place (insert Oriental Sampling).  Other great tracks include &quot;Session&quot; which, once again, showcases Linkin Park's DJ techniques, &quot;Don't Stay,&quot; <br />However, Meteora does have one small tiny problem... its 36 minutes long.  Each song estimates at roughly 3 mins--not bad, but with only 12 tracks, it begins and then ends in very short time.  However, during that short time, you will grow to love the CD.<br />Longer, it would have warranted a 5, but with such great music in so little time, it gets a 4.<br />The originaters of rap-rock-dj-techno-anger have returned to dominate the world one more time.

0956827810|5|I wish this book will soon be available in Spanish, So I can buy it to my husband!! he would love it..
B005529EI2|5|Excellent visual rendition of one of the greatest books of one of the greatest series of these  books ever written.
1451673442|5|While I enjoy The Secret and The Power, in this new book Rhonda Byrne finally gives us some practical step-by-step exercises we can use to incorporate the law of attraction into our lives. Each of the 28 daily exercises focuses on gratitude and recognition of the abundance you already have in order to ensure that the abundance continues and grows. This concept is easy to get but hard to master which is why I am so excited about following the steps she suggested. You can do each exercise on its own or follow the schedule she lays out in the book. Well worth the money and your time. Thanks Rhonda!!!
B00129H7VS|5|Got this for my 16 year old son who is obsessed with WWII.  He loved it and has finished watching it in 3 days.
0805095152|5|Physician and writer Atul Gawande explores end of life care in his book titled, Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. I expect most of us want a good death, not too soon. Gawande explores how healthcare lets down patients especially at the end of life when actions are taken to stave off death, but end up prolonging suffering and eliminating any consideration of how a patient would like to spend their final days. Asking the right questions of patients and giving them the ability to make better choices is at the core of achieving well-being as defined by the individual. Rather than a cold exploration of the topic, this book presents personal stories, including the end of life care received by Gawande’s father. For most of us, the questions about the quality of life as we approach the end of life can be difficult. Isolation and avoidance of death is not the answer. We can all count on dying. This book can help readers think through what well-being means for each of us and what might constitute a good death.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)
B00CSR2J9I|5|I only got this because my nephew asked. And now I play it constantly
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is cute, fun, and an overall success to the endless runner genre. With tons of locations, power ups, and costumes to unlock it really does keep your attention for quite some time.
B0044XV3QY|5|I loved Avatar and especially the Extended Collector's Edition. The most complete picture of how the movie was made. I've spent hours perusing it and I'm not done.
B0000024UX|5|There is no adjective to describe this album. It is quite simply one of the best albums of the century and is the quintessential folk album of its generation. The title song sets the tone for the songs to follow. Bridge over troubled water touches each listener on a level that few songs can lay claim to. There is a fine balance in the songs. From the catchy tunes of &quot;Keep the customer satisfied&quot; and &quot; Baby driver&quot; to softer poetic materpieces like the unrivaled &quot;Boxer&quot;, a song that contain some of the most profound and tender lyrics found in folk music. Then there is &quot; The only living boy in New York&quot;, one of S&amp; G 's most uneratted songs that has moved people to tears - I have seen it with my own eyes.  Simon and Garfunkel is a musical religious experience that transends time and seems to penetrate one's soul create a sense of inner peace. This is the triumph of S &amp; G. There words alone are worthy of being published in Poetry anthologies and the quality of there music is on a par with any I have heard.
B009XIXVU6|5|Very interesting and well written book about loss and faith.  Loved how the author intertwined the characters throughout the book.  Kept me guessing what was going to happen next and then aha....you were given the story to put all the pieces together.
B009LDD590|5|The Boardwalk Empire is in itself is very entertaining historical fiction; it depicts a time that not many folks know about - the Prohibition years of the 1920's. It has a wonderful cast and magnificent set details - perfect date-night entertainment!.<br />If you liked the first three years you'll certainly not want to miss the third season. We bought the first two seasons on DVD, but decided to go with Blu-ray for the third. The images are truly beautiful as well as entertaining.
B000002O4S|5|Not only did this cd arrive super fast, it was in immaculate shape without the stainless steal jewel case or a flux capacitor. Beautiful sound quality, 0 scratches, 100% awsome. I recommend this album to anyone who wants to get their morning started with a little Huey Lewis (and if your running late...it makes you feel better.), who wants a reason to speed on the road or shopping mall lot, and for those who just want those hard to find songs that fill up meer seconds in the actual movie.
B00C8S9VKM|4|Great historical read with numerous stories highlighting famous people and their lives all occurring or culminating in one year-1927. Wow.
B009HQ9UHC|3|It is a little lame after a while, it is the same thing over and over , I like it but, not as much as my other apps.
0984999302|3|This book is chalked full of information, but it is more of a encyclopedia than a how to manual.<br /><br />If you are looking for every last thing that Steve Blank might think about the lean process, you might find this book interesting.<br /><br />If you are looking for a practical &#34;how to&#34; manual on starting up a company, I would not recommend this as your first step.
B00003CXAA|5|I don't need to write anything about the films.  You wouldn't be reading this is you didn't like them anyway.  I thought the quality of video and sound was great.  The extras were fun and interesting.  There were things I did not know which made this collection a good buy for me.  I never knew most of the things I saw in the bonus sections.  Seeing James Caan audition for Michael was very weird and then learning that virtually everyone wanted him as Michael was even odder to imagine.  There are lots of interviews and some deleted scenes as well.  All in all this is a great collection of some of the finest cinematic performances on film.
B009RX85N0|5|I love it
B00CNQ7HAU|4|The descriptions and characters were just as vivid and interesting as in A Time To Kill.  I kept with it because of that, but the story isn't nearly as compelling and the end didn't yield a surprise.
B00EJOCAYW|4|my grand daughter of 10 is having fun with this - pieces are so small - she doesn't mind - its a challenge for her and she loves it!!!
B00004Z4WR|4|An oldie but goodie! I love the cars in this movie. I like the actors also. Which in turn makes a good movie when you like who you are watching.
B00FLML7HW|5|Great deal and awesome movies.
B00AE6SS5O|1|Stupid game and game trying to steal my data.  What's the point? I hated the first 5minutes.. It got worse..
B0054JZC6E|4|there are lots of fun games but some are too hard to complete. that and it seems like you never get enough points for the games so you have to either download stuff you don't want or buy points.
B005S9EJ14|5|One of my favorite films I've seen this year is the charming, funny, and heartwarming treat THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL, which contains a handful of my favorite actors working today.  The story is about seven retirement-age Brits, each for reasons of his or her own decide to answer an ad and relocate to India, to the posh/upscale (yet very affordable) Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which has been specifically geared for retirees.<br /><br />There is Graham (Tom Wilkinson), on a mission to find a lost love; Doug and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton), who have lost most of their money in a bad investment in their daughter's online company; Muriel (Maggie Smith), a grouchy bigot who needs hip replacement surgery and can only get it right away in India; Evelyn (Judi Dench), a widow who feels she's lost her place in the world; Madge (Celia Imrie), on the hunt for a rich husband; and Norman (Ronald Pickup), the eternal skirt chaser who still fancies himself a ladies man even in his \\"golden years\\".<br /><br />All seven meet on the way to India, and upon arrival realize that the hotel depicted in the ads/brochure is by far NOT the rundown, shabby, badly-in-need of repair former palace that lies before them - run by Sonny (the ever-brilliant Dev Patel), who has so much energy and so much heart, and is determined to do everything he can to get the money needed so he can restore the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (\\"Now with Guests!\\" as the sign he soon puts out front reads) back to its former glory.<br /><br />India, depicted as a patchwork of sound and noise and people - lots and LOTS of people - affects each of the seniors in a different way.  But each of them IS affected, most of them deeply, and the film is not only a love letter to India but also a love letter to the human spirit that lives - and can be rekindled - in us all, no matter how old we are or how far withdrawn from life we feel we've become.  Funny, enchanting, beautifully written and with a perfect cast, it's a film that will touch your heart without going overboard into sentiment.  A lovely, inspiring film.film that will touch your heart without going overboard into sentiment.  A lovely, inspiring film.
B00IVDXAN2|4|The heavy musical piece on the one glove annoyed my daughter because she said it was uncomfortable and got in the way. She was trying to wear them all day in Disney so maybe a shorter period would be ok.
1419702238|4|kids love it and makes a great addition to their collection of these books they have enjoyed since they came out
B00AQ3K8IU|3|I thought it was a book for teenagers but it had a surprising twist that held my interest, it was light reading and a good story. A great read for the holidays
B009ZM74F8|5|It took me a minute to get into the storyline, but I would recommend it to others.  There's quite a bit of action to keep your attention.
B00B4VI8MQ|3|most just hidden objects games. not many puzzles games. still a good game. not much else to but this thing is making me write more. dumb I shouldn't have to write is much just to tell people if its a good game or not.
B003P2WO5E|5|I enjoy a variety of styles when I read, this one hit the spot with its different characters leading the story line
B00018D44U|2|Wow.  What can say?  I can safely say Nora won't have to worry about carting home eight Grammys next year.  She won't have to worry about carting away one.  This is one of the biggest sophomore flops I can remember and my expectations were not even that high.<br />There are so many things wrong with this CD: 1) The sound transfer to the CD is awful.  I played this at a low volume and her voice was still distorted in three of the songs.  2) The material, melodies and album continuity is absolutely dismal.  I only liked one song on the disc, In The Morning, which is why I even gave it two stars.  These are not quality written songs.  3) She did a duet with Dolly Parton on Creepin' In and Dolly wasn't listed as a co-singer.  She was only listed in the \\"appears as a courtesy\\" section.  Such disrespect for an icon.  4) The record company released the liner notes with unfinished paper.  Yep, not even a gloss finish.  It's no surprise because it matches the rest of the album - CHEAP.<br />Friends and fellow music lovers, if you think this is going to be even remotely like her debut album, you are wrong.  This is unprofessional piano lounge music.  I think Capitol Records owes the music community an explanation.  This reeks of corporate greed and does nothing to raise musical interests.
030726999X|3|It took a while to get into the story.  I don't think it was as good as the 2 previous books, but it does bring the whole saga to a conclusion.
B00BHHIWQO|5|Fun !!!!!! And fast  keeps you on your track for the next move.challenging  and keeps you guessing what is next.
B008YI91HS|5|2 year old grandson loves this show. When he visits, he wants to watch it during quiet time before a nap. Who knew. LOL
1476753164|5|Colleen Hoover keeps doing this to us again and again....and again. I have honestly never been able to enjoy an author's next book as much as I enjoy every new book Hoover writes. It is not that she is just consistently good....she consistently improves, surprises, and moves the hearts and souls of her readers in so many unique ways. Every. Single. Time.<br /><br />“Hey, heart. Are you listening? You and I are officially at war.”<br /><br />Maybe Someday is no exception. The story of Sydney and Ridge, I can honestly say, is unlike any story I have ever read in this genre. It is so refreshing to read such a unique storyline combined with such uniquely written characters. And you know how in Slammed, at about 20% in we were all hit with something that changed everything completely? Well there is something like that in this book too. Something only Colleen could pull off so perfectly and shamelessly.<br /><br />“Kisses like his should come with a warning label. They can't be good for the heart.”<br /><br />I am not going to sugar coat anything though. This book is going to make you feel butterflies and melt your heart right in your chest....but it is also going to gut you with a knife at times and make you so frustrated. Oh, and you will feel guilty too. But the characters themselves are frustrated. And Sydney and Ridge feel gutted. And Sydney and Ridge also feel love and butterflies. And yes, they feel guilty too. So it makes sense for us to feel the same way as the characters. Somehow Colleen takes us there, from emotion to emotion so seamlessly, I felt like I was going through it all with them. It was brilliantly done, and I applaud her in her ability to do this for her readers.<br /><br />&#34;I'm worried that feelings are the one thing in our lives that we have absolutely no control over.&#34;<br /><br />But I do also want to say, you are going to laugh. A lot. There are some great comical scenes in this book, and they will make you laugh out loud so hard.You will wish you knew a Warren and a Bridgette, that's for sure.<br /><br />&#34;Fresh fish and duct tape. I'm still not sure what he has planned, but I sort of like where this is headed.&#34;<br /><br />Now, the final piece I want to review is the music....which is honestly part of the book as much as the words of each chapter. Make sure you have access to the music when you start the book and listen to each song when it makes its appearance in the book. The lyrics are not enough. Griffin Peterson's music is so good, and there is so much emotion in his songs that it trickles its way right into your soul and makes everything Sydney and Ridge are feeling that more potent to us as the readers. Think about it this way CoHo fans....if we had been given access to audio of all the slams in Slammed....wouldn't you have listened to those along the way? Hell yeah we would have. This is the same thing, but better! I applaud Colleen Hoover and Griffin Peterson for doing something so unprecedented in the music/writing world. Thank you for this experience, both of you. Because that is what reading Maybe Someday is. An experience. A five star moving, wonderful, experience.<br /><br />&#34;I love how she focuses so intently on the lyrics, as if she's in her own world and I'm just a lucky observer.&#34;<br /><br />I received an ARC of this book via the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.
B004MC8CA2|5|You can't go wrong with the Bible!
0790734850|5|This is an excellent, thought-provoking mystery. The script is intelligent; the acting is powerful; and it is a movie that will keep the audience captivated from the opening scene until the end. The most interesting thing about this film is the depth of the characters. There is no clear \\"good\\" since every character is intensely human with some significant flaw, and this makes the characters very believable and sympathetic. The performances of both Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe are amazing.
B009HUB40Y|5|The game keeps me going back to play over and over again. My grandaughter also enjoys the game very much.
B00U7VDC7A|5|This game is really cool. I would suggest this to people who like adventure games.You guys MUST have this game.
B006R8GK2Q|4|A straightforward and fun game. Just the right level of difficulty. A pleasant way to relax. It's worth downloading and giving a try. Also, very re-playable.
0446677450|4|This was fairly good, although I think it could have been greatly reduced.  At age 21, I never really thought of what it took to make more money.  I always thought that it was the doctors and lawyers who were rich.  Turns out that it is &quot;what you keep-not what you make)<br />The reason he won't tell you exactly what type of stock to invest in, or which piece of real estate to buy, is because opportunities change.  If someone told you 200 years ago that buggies were a profitable business, he would be right.  If someone told you today to start up a buggie business, you would be closed on opening day.  &quot;Look for opportunities where others don't see it&quot;  There that's the concept, and I don't see what's so hard about it.  You have to think on your own.<br />Some have said that this book is poorly written because it has many contradictions.  Well, so does the Holy Bible.  It says &quot;Love thy neighbor&quot; than says in Levictus &quot;Anyone who works on Sunday should be stoned to death&quot;.  Yet...that too is a popular book.<br />I would also suggest reading Multiple Streams of Income by Robert Allen.
0399213015|5|Donated to a children's agency for Christmas.
B00BEZTMFY|5|Seriously, I don't think I have to rave about this movie... but I will. I have not read the books, nor watch the Lord of the Ring a whole lot... but I watched this and immediately turned the Lord of the Ring on marathon style.<br /><br />So heartfelt, and the emotions are real. You feel it with the characters.<br /><br />Even if you're not a Lord of the Ring fan, check this one out, it stands on it's own very well.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Absolutely love it!!  So sad to hear it will soon end 😳
6305342768|3|Ok, so this sci fi movie isn't great.  But, on the good side, it isn't too bad either.<br />I like the concept of Disney writing this movie where Ernest Borgnine,Yvette Mimeux,Anthony Perkins are on a mission to chart a black hole in 2130.<br />Personally, I like the whole idea of the scientist Max Schnell, wanting to take the crew into the black hole.<br />The ending was great. Some people don't get it. Too cereberal for them I suppose. Ok, it isn't 2001. It isn't supposed to be.<BR>This movie needs to be judged on its own. And when it is, it's pretty good.<br />Aside from the dialog, and the cute robots, the story is good.
0316228532|1|Couldn't bring myself to continue reading after the first seven pages.  Somehow I expected a charming, well-written story with interesting characters and intriguing background.  What I got was the British version of a Danielle Steele novel.  For those who are looking for a charming, gentle read, this is NOT it.  Lesson to self: never assume that a great writer will continue to be a great writer when changing genres.
B0015AARJI|5|I bought this hoping to get a \\"PS2\\" controller that I could hook up to my pc via bluetooth. I got that, with a little twist.     The L2 and R2 buttons have been turned into triggers! It feels a little cheap like I might break them, and definitely a change from the dualshock 2.    Not a big deal, and it's still a wonderful controller, but for those of you thinking you'll be receiving a wireless ps2 controller (more or less), you aren't.
B00BD99JMW|1|It was such a disappointing ending to a great series. It felt rushed. Like she just wanted to get the series over with and move on. I waited a long time for that last book and was disappointed.
B007PTJOV0|5|just the type of game I like! now can play it on my kindle.  very similar to classic Mario Bros...  instant favorite!
B002SSUQFG|1|I bought this watch thinking that being a Seiko that it would be superior to the 10 dollar watches sold at Family Dollar.<br />WRONG!!! It worked for a few weeks then had to be sent out for repair. I received it some time later only to have it<br />stop working a second time. It is low quality, just like the junk they sell at dollar stores. How there are so many good reviews<br /> leads me to believe that there is some dishonesty afoot.  AVOID THIS \\"WATCH\\"  Mark my words I shall NEVER buy another<br />Seiko EVER!!!!!!!!!!
B008NW67E0|5|Love this album. Great work by a great band! I can't wait for their Red Rocks DVD to be released. These guys are amazing!
B00J2PEZAU|5|Loved this flick. Its a girls movie but as a guy I still liked it...Jennifer Lawrence is a Hot Young Actress
B007IXWL2C|4|since I already had an idea about this book ( already read the other two)  it was like the other two ok.
B004P1JEXE|4|Jumps from character to character but still a great read
B00HI0R80A|5|Never saw this series and have been watching it all through Amazon Prime!  Can't get enough!  Just love the show!
B00K5M19XA|2|Interesting twist in the Batman storyline, but I found the &#34;son&#34; to be too whiny and brat-like to make this animated movie enjoyable. I suppose serious DC fanbois may enjoy this, but as a casual comic book/graphic novel reader, this video was ultimately just too tedious to sit through more than one viewing.
B0078XFYDA|5|Must read for teenagers and everyone else.  I love having tons of scientific explanations about the natural world in one short collection while at the same time exposing the myths of religious cults.
B00FCQQ1IW|5|Each book of the Clifton Chronicles left me waiting for the next one.  Great Archer series. Waiting for Book 5 now.
B007VF1X12|5|Stupendous.
B00008PW3Q|4|The classic pairing of Buckingham and Nicks shines on this latest Fleetwood Mac album. Many of these songs have subtle reminders of Lindsey's Mac work in the 80s, with just the right amount of seasoning the years have brought to his skill. Nobody can produce Nicks like Buckingham. Fleetood and McVie have not lost their touch at all... keeping rhythm with Buckingham's sizzling guitar work is astounding and these two pull it off masterfully, as always. Buckingham recalls himself on Tusk; a few tracks on this album are very conceptual and creatively genius. This is one of those albums you listen to several times, then start to feel like there aren't enough songs on it, so you hit Play again. The only thing I don't care for about this album is the sequencing- it's a bit jagged; maybe that opinion will change with more rotations. Anyway...Thanks... it was definitely worth the wait for a new album from this dynamic grouping of musicians, despite Christine's absence!
B00FAPF5U0|5|LOVE Candy Crush. I'm very addicted to it and wish my &#34;lives&#34; would regenerate more quickly!!! Can't go wrong with some candy crush.
B004DI7HZ6|5|I think I will read it over and over after I read the rest of the series!  Well written and most enjoyable!
B002MQYOFW|5|I had no plans to get much out of it but the characters and story were so intriguing I finished the first book, got the other two and ran right through the series in less than two weeks.  I watched the first film and was really sorry to find that the other two books were not available as movies yet.  I was right there when the second movie opened in theaters because I could not wait to see how the book would be developed on screen.
B003QF8E4A|5|Aside from the VERY DRAMATIC MUSIC DURING SCENES WHERE  very little of import is actually happening....<br />It's a good movie.<br />A reeeaaaallly good movie.

B00HHJPUFM|5|Oh gosh, what can I say...<br />I LOVED Despicable Me when I first saw it, so you can imagine my childhood glee when I saw the promos for a part 2! Lets just say Agnes screams were not far different from mine. Watching this movie made me fall in love with it all over again. If you haven't seen it, watch it. I saw it in theaters and then proceeded to purchase it through amazon instant video because I knew I would be watching this one again.<br /><br />If you're a fan look out for the new glimpse into Minions! Minions is the upcoming prequel to Despicable Me.
0783225857|5|I bought this movie to show my students after we read To Kill a Mockingbird. It follows the book closely and was a great teaching tool. My students  enjoyed the movie, and their only complaint was that it is in black and white. This is a wonderful movie even if you haven't read the book (but we all know the book is always better.)
B00DURGZHW|4|I was expecting a criminal thrill-ride like Kalifornia and Natural Born Killers, but what ensued was a character driven movie with very nuanced characters. McConaughey is exceptional in the movie along with the young cast members.
B005UG542S|4|More entertaining than the first part of this final chapter, this was a good ending for an excellent series of books and movies. Sorry to see it end.
1250010489|5|I've read many of Mark Russinovich's technical books and articles and was at first hesitant to read his first novel, Zero Day. Could an author known for his quality technical writing successfully write a work of fiction that would be both engaging to technical and non-technical readers alike?<br /><br />Fortunately my fears were unfounded - both Zero Day and Trojan Horse are entertaining reads that I would recommended to anyone who enjoys a good action thriller. Technical readers will appreciate the attention to detail and proper use of terminology. There are no eye-roll inducing phrases like \\"hacking the BitLocker socket firewall MPLS\\" here. Non-technical readers will appreciate that they don't have to be IT pros to enjoy the novel and both groups will easily get caught up in the web of intrigue that Mark spins in his second novel.<br /><br />Anyone who works in the IT industry will no doubt feel a knot in the pit of their stomach upon the conclusion of this book. The threats that Mark highlights are very real. As another reviewer mentioned, this work of fiction could be ripped from tomorrow's headlines. In fact, just as I finished reading the novel there was a major outage at an Internet provider that lasted almost a full work day and my first thought was to this book that I had just read.<br /><br />Part prophetic tome and part work of fiction, there's a lot here for any reader to enjoy. Recommended.
B00C5R7B0I|5|Great book. Did not disappoint!
092389165X|5|Widely considered a masterpiece, this book was published as the entire edition of The New Yorker before it was released in book form, and it won a major poll as the most important piece of journalism in the 20th century.  It is not hard to see why once you begin reading it.  Hersey's piece is a careful, realistic description of what is actually involved in experiencing and surviving an atomic blast, told from the viewpoints of several real people who did just that: a young Japanese office worker, Toshiko Sasaki; a Japanese minister, Rev. Tanimoto; a German priest, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge; a successful physician, Dr. Fujii; a young surgeon, Dr. Sasaki and one or two others.  None of them were involved in the war effort - they were simply going about their business one August morning in Hiroshima when their worlds were completely, and for the most part permanently, turned upside down.<br /><br />Hersey describes in matter-of-fact fashion scenes that I had never heard of before, that I had perhaps only caught glimpses of in the most frightening, bizarre films or nightmares.  The silent, blinding flash, the sudden darkness, the strong winds, the falling particles - and later, the suffering of the dying, gathered together in hellish assemblages, and the clear-eyed observations of those fortunate enough to have survived sudden death and serious injury.  They were not, in most cases, fortunate enough to avoid the ongoing miseries of radiation sickness, with its myriad symptoms and effects, and a large part of the book is spent exploring this topic.<br /><br />The author practices a more discreet form of nonfiction writing than one customarily sees today; he is more the invisible observer and the communicator of information than a character in the text.  He seems to have a lot of respect for his subjects, and he portrays them compassionately and directly, without engaging in much criticism or analysis.  We witness these people in the days after the bomb, and we learn howthey were able to survive, but we are also shown the sometimes long and difficult roads they travelled back to ordinary living - and then later on (the book was updated in 1985) we see them as older people.  The young doctor, after working heroically following the bomb, eventually becomes a successful older doctor, with a family and a number of interests.  The German priest takes a Japanese name and develops a close relationships with one of the other survivors described in the book; she helps nurse him through his many radiation-related health problems.  The young minister gets involved with the famous American activist Dr. Norman Cousins, and becomes a leader of the survivors movement, before falling out with some of his fellow hibakusha (bomb-afflicted).  The young woman eventually becomes a nun, and the successful manager of a spiritual community.<br /><br />There were times when I was less than excited by Hershey's writing style, but I was never less than enthralled by his reportage or the great significance of the events set out in this book.  \\"Hiroshima\\" is part of the curriculum of some schools, but that is not enough - it should be required reading for everyone, especially for those who think the threat of nuclear war and proliferation is something that can be easily ignored.
B00A9T1HUO|5|We truly enjoy this CD.  There are always a couple songs one doesn't &#34;love&#34; as much as the others, but as usual Josh Groban has produced a very fine CD that is perfect listening music at any time.  He obviously has a very good background of pronunciation of other languages, and because he understands what he is singing, this comes through in each song.
B00CWY76CC|5|Challenging and fun. A thinker! Like that I can shop and go back and figure out the puzzle. Keeps the mind sharp.
6304068441|5|The movie has power and grace. It also makes a statement about the death penalty.  <br />Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon are excellent in this film.
B00079FUI6|5|My BOYFRIEND got me into this series, and i couldn't be happier. It is hilarious and addicting. We got this season here at a great price.
B003JTHXOK|5|Watched the movie and yen read the book. I love the book so much better. They should have added some more of the book into the movie.
B00SH00N3Y|1|Looks cool but the screenplay was bad and the science was worse. The pseudo-intellectual posturing did make for some good chuckles, though. It's a shame the movie was so bad as there's a good story in there...somewhere.
B00009MGGI|5|Francis Urquhart, aka \\"FU\\", always has a diabolical trick or two up his sleeve.  But does he hold the last Ace card?
0385738765|5|best book series i have ever read. i read a  lot and this is no doubt, the best. it is so cliff-hanging once you think he is safe after the first book, the cranks come. you can never guess what will happen next.
B007TNQ7EY|5|Such a good game. The jobs kinda hard and money hard to get but otherwise one of my favourites worth 499.
0385344430|5|Love, love, love it! Full of everything Gabaldon fans crave- familiar faces, exciting settings, challenges for our favorite characters. My only complaint is that it's too short!!!
B00AAQRNQ8|1|Mouse turns off and on constantly only after two months of using it. After three months it turned off completely. Asked Anker to send me a replacement and they agreed they would send me one after I ship this one back. Will update review if the next mouse doesn't break down again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I did not want to get hooked on this, but I am.  I can hardly wait for the next episode!

B000A6T262|5|I bought this set for my son for Christmas last year.  He absolutely loves it.  He is a confirmed trekkie.
B004QZ9PLU|3|The best of me wasn't as good as my friends at work said. I was disappointed with some of the storyline. It was written pretty well but the story didn't move me and that's important to me in a book. I feel this one wasn't worth my money.
B003E8GQ76|3|George C's performance was somewhat unconvincing. Good story, could have been done better.
B00785P2QC|4|Easy to play and not to involved
B008Y212PI|5|This is a fun puzzle game that requires some logic and strategy. A lot of puzzle hours for the price.
B00GXKVZSW|4|Visually stunning with only a few missteps. High production values and a remarkable cast make  this series a cut above the rest.
B003TSEEDY|4|I enjoyed reading this book but I wonder why the author decided to write in the journal format. I also wish we could have found out who Charlie was writing to.
B008MG1E4A|5|This Book give you insight on the courageous people that serve our country so we can  live in peace. We should never take for granted the those that &#34;give all&#34;.
B000RZIGVS|5|Complete series in easy to use discs with many extra features. A must for Trekkies!!
1577311523|5|Like any other form of self-improvement, spiritual practice, or life-altering steps, you must be in a position to accept and act out these changes.  <br />Many bash The Power of Now for not being able to understand it or not being able to practice it, and so they claim that Eckhart Tolle is just a capitalist trying to steal peoples' money by selling mumbo jumbo.  This is totally the opposite.  It is easy to understand how any person who has not read this book and understood it could come to believe that this person is a capitalist and is now living in a 3 story mansion with several exotic cars.  It's easy to imagine that, and to think negatively of someone who made a great profit off of a book since he has a lot more money than we do, but if you actually understood what your mind was doing, you would realize that you are just mindlessly defending yourself because you are in a position far inferior to him, and your mind dislikes it, so you lash out.<br />The fact is, this book is simply amazing.  I have been on different medications, on and off, and yes, SEVERAL of them have not helped at all.  I will say this: everyone needs some form of help, whether it is medicine, reading, or just time.  If someone had suggested this book to me when I first began having neurosis, I probably wouldn't have been able to accept it for truly what it's worth simply because I was in no position other than true desperation.  If you are on the brink of suicide, or your life is falling to pieces, this book will not help you experience a dramatic transformation that happened with Tolle during his life.  This book would be most beneficial if you are at an OK stage in your life, not falling apart, not great, just there, looking for more, as most of the population is.  \\"Does it get any better?\\"  Sometimes you might find yourself asking this.  If you feel like you want to die, you should seek other help, and probably medication.  If you simply CANNOT stop yourself from obsessive thought or anxiety even when you go through several well-known exercises, you probably need medication.  There is a \\"food chain\\" involved in self improvement.  At the most desperate level, people need medicine.  Once they are at a stable level to accept therapy and positive life changes, they can seek a therapist, therapy groups, and begin reading books like this.  Tolle doesn't speak much in the aspect of medicine, but from personal experience, I can tell you that medicine doesn't make you \\"not need\\" this book, but in fact simply allows you to accept it as a normal person would.  You would be able to benefit from it, and greatly improve your life.  Don't look to this book for reprieve if you are on the brink of insanity.  For most people, this book is simply hit or miss.  If you are ready to accept it, you realize its potential and how simply beautiful it is.  If you aren't, you will cast it out as a sham to take advantage of people.  It's not.<br />Alas, there is a reason I gave it five stars.  The teachings, practices, and views on life will simply begin making you into a different person, if you haven't already yourself.  As Tolle explains, most people who reach this stage have suffered greatly in their life, perhaps by the death of someone close, or by severe clinical depression.  He teaches that we are simply emotionally tormented and taken advantage of by our minds, and once we are able to \\"surrender\\" and accept where we are and this present moment, we will not be at peace with ourselves.  Have you heard of prison death-row inmates, minutes or hours before being executed, suddenly finding peace?  They are looking for a way out constantly, fearing their death more than anything else a person could ever fear, but they finally escape.  Why?  There is nothing else to do, and your Being simply gives up this fear and accepts the present moment, and you are at peace.  This does not mean giving up, it means accepting the moment, and not resisting it, nor reacting through natural emotional defense.  I could go on and on, but the book is a much better and more thorough teacher than I could ever sum up in a review.<br />Do not let emotions run your life, or your decisions, or your relationships.  \\"Respond, don't react.\\"  You will dramatically change your life by simply being more present and obsessing less, and surrendering to the moment.  You drop a plate of food, do you freak out and curse?  Do you resist?  Why??  As soon as you drop it, accept it as if it had been dropped a month ago, and simply clean it up.  It takes 10 seconds.  What is the point of that emotional upheaval we create when things like this happen?  Our life is filled with things like this.  You will make good decisions, based on a clear objective consciousness, not emotion or obsessive thoughts or fears.<br />There is simply no way someone's life could NOT be improved by reading this book.  The degree to which it happens is in the hands of the reader.  I highly recommend this book, and I have read several of its kind.  It is simply the most organized, truthful, and comprehensive of all I've read.  You will never spend 15 dollars on anything better in your life, even with global currency conversion rates.
B00AREIAI8|5|its a really nice game and its very realistic.and to think its free!Although it takes time but it gives you something to look forward to
B00HZ3C4N6|5|I have seen most of the moves based on the Tom Clancy books, and although this one is not based on any of his books it is still based on the Jack Ryan character.  Not only did it have an interesting story line, but the cast of characters and the actors who played them were superb.  It was full of action without being overtly graphic.
6302518393|5|This is a charming heartwarming movie for the whole family! Everyone will be in love with this 180 pound loveble dog by the end of the movie! Its so cute, I think everyone would enjoy it!
B00003CWRX|5|This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino. It was well worthy of it's oscar nomination for best picture. The movie builds with tension as the it moves along. The DVD has some great features and great  picture quality. The movie is over 2 hours but as with any great film time  is not an issue. This is well worth the money to buy.
0156027321|4|Yann Martel's three-part epic detailing Pi Patel's life has been touted as many things: life-changing, God-realizing, a testament to the power of storytelling (this by President Obama). I found it to be an interesting, well-told story, with a conclusion that didn't quite feel fully realized, or even able to describe what I *think* Martel wanted to describe.  We see Pi's love for three major religions. We see his unyielding love for God, able to be represented in multiple different ways, all of them equal and understandable and respectable. Pi does not question God's existence. However, in the end, when we as readers are forced to choose and determine \\"the\\" story--we are asked (via Martel's authorial insertions in the book) to pick \\"the better story.\\" This phrase, \\"the better story,\\" is where Martel loses me. If we pick the better story (basically, that God exists), is that because the other, more plain story (randomness, evolution) is real, but the God story is simply \\"better?\\" What is Martel trying to have the reader determine? It seems obvious that Martel himself is religious, God-fearing, a believer, but this idea seems to contradict that. It's like he's saying, hey, I know evolution and chance is *the* reality, but I like the God story better, so I'm going to go with that.  So I get confused. Rather than this book being \\"an elegant proof of the existence of God\\" (President Obama's words), it seems to be \\"an exercise that demonstrates that believing in God is more fun than believing in science.\\"  Now--that philosophical and spiritual rant aside, Life of Pi is a good, well-researched story that is touching and teaching. Martel inspires in showing how well he knows those three major religions, Indian culture, Franco-Indian relations, oceanic survival, zoology, marine life, etc. He has done a good job inserting different pieces into this story. Although sometimes I was left feeling that he had multiple ideas for stories (zookeeping in India, a ship that sinks and lifeboat survival, a man-eating island) and just tried to weave them all together--it can feel disjointed (especially the man-eating island bit). But all in all it does work, amazingly, convincingly even, and with a good pacing.  I enjoyed the book while reading it, hence my four star review. But that doesn't clear up the confusion it left me with -- and then I realized that maybe that was Martel's intent all along, to at least hope the reader would seriously consider these questions and their implications. If so, he succeeded.  --- ---  \\"everything has a trace of the divine in it\\" (48)  \\"The individual soul touches upon the world soul like a well reaches for the water table. That which sustains the universe beyond thought and language, and that which is at the core of us and struggles for expression, is the same thing. The finite within the infinite, the infinite within the finite.\\" (49)  \\"Faith in God is an opening up, a letting go, a deep trust, a free act of love\\" (208)  \\"Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer.\\" (297)
B0084AZXKK|5|a timeless classic
B008Y73940|5|Suspensful and intreging! Would highly recommend it and I have to all my friends! Glad it was available for my viewing!
B00EHMFC78|5|A slam-dunk of a good read.
B001KVZ69I|5|What did the Holocaust look like through the eyes of Jewish children consigned to the concentration camps? Or through the eyes of an entirely normal Nazi family whose father was \\"promoted\\" from Berlin to Commandant of a death camp in the countryside? Bruno is only eight years old, so he's naturally curious about the \\"farm\\" only a few hundred yards from his family mansion, where people wear striped pajamas with numbers on them. Where black smoke billows from chimneys, and where horrid smells fill the air. And if Pavel was a doctor, why is he now wearing those pajamas and peeling potatoes for his family? Bruno forms an unlikely friendship through the electric barbed wire with another eight-year-old, Shmuel. The innocence that they share puts into bold relief the horrendous consequences of the Holocaust -- for the Jews, of course, but in unlikely and catastrophic ways for every member of this prim, proper, and patriotic family whose father was responsible for \\"making the world better.\\" The film explores a horrible paradox of the Holocaust -- that an evil of unimaginable magnitude was carried out by everyday people just like us.
B0046B8GEQ|5|SO FUNNY. now I know what everyone is talking about!
B00HCOSF3G|5|great song
B00PSLQGX6|5|Just as most people agree... It's terrific.  Lynne from Sellersville
B00F52YOPA|3|Fire HD6 - 4th gen - faotd. I was really enjoying this game, but it has now gotten stuck loading level 25. Never got to do any decorating. Deleting now. :-/ Update - I got it to work again, and bumping my rating up from 1 to 3. It's a fun game, but limited. Once you've decorated the room, there's no point in playing anymore.
B005GFPZYK|4|It was very objective and informative. It described what heroes these soldiers really are.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Consistently great show. We love it.
B0054JZC6E|3|Fun game just stinks how costs so much to buy games play it a lot though don't need another app for a while
B0012Q732O|4|I rented 10,000 BC when it first arrived on DVD, and I, without embarrassment, really enjoyed it!  I had a couple of free coupons for Previously Viewed Movies at Blockbuster, so while browsing I came across this DVD at the local store and pounced on it like a big woolly mammoth! Upon checkout, the clerk asked me, \\"Have you seen this film?\\"  I answered, \\"Yes, and I really liked it.\\"  She shook her head and said, \\"I have to agree with all the bad reviews; it's not even historically accurate.\\"  I don't know about the rest of you, but I grew up in the 60's and 70's and caught sci-fi movies from the 50's and 60's en masse, as well as King Kong, Godzilla and monster movies!  None of those could ever be deemed historically accurate, but that's not why I watched them.  They were entertaining as anything offered today, and my friends and I still engage in our memories of watching Saturday B movies back then!  What FUN!  Does anyone here remember \\"Robinson Crusoe on Mars?\\"  An astronaut, crash lands on Mars, befriends a runaway slave whom he teaches English.  Along the way they eat and drink from Mars surface (and breathe as well) along with their pet Monkey, Mona.  Eventually, all three are rescued from the melting polar ice cap.  It was a suspended fun journey of disbelief, and to this day I remember that film fondly.  Ironically, I was reminded of the same fun journey of disbelief with \\"10,000 BC.\\"  I'll watch it again and again with all those other fun B movies I own.  That's why I enjoy films!
B005HSL626|5|i swear this game is awesome...especially when you have all the blades and backgrounds xD it never grows old to me, or my family. We all are addicted to it!!
B0000AQS0F|5|How much do I like Firefly?  So far I've bought 3----or is it 4----copies of the series on DVD, but I keep \\"losing\\" them.  It always starts the same way.....someone says something about the movie, like, \\"Oh, it's okaaaay, but I don't see what the big deal is....\\"  Next thing I know, I've given up trying to explain the whole series to them, and hand my copy over.  And that's the last I see of it.  *sigh*
B00DJFIMW6|5|This is a fun game to play.. my kids love it. Everyone in the house lobes it. It's great so much fun
B0089LOG02|5|Mavelous! What a delighful journey into to the deep fellings of humanity. Well done. I really enjoy it. A best seller
B00LU0XO3O|5|I ordered this for my brother-in-law who is a retired farmer in ND. He has been on many trips around the world with hundreds of  old slides to digitize. He loves this scanner.  He took it to a photo shop and they thought it was the best they had ever seen.
B009ZQ8FQG|1|I am a Prime member.  The show is available for free on Prime, but if you make the wrong click you buy it.  The site does nothing to make the correct click easy or to alert you that it is purchase and not a free watch before confirming - which would be easy enough to do IF THEY WANTED TO.<br /><br />Just try and get a refund from these guys after you make a wrong click.
B00FAPF5U0|5|The game is challenging and fun to play.
B009OYSFDM|5|Wonderful show. Takes Green Arrow in its own direction and makes a lot of sense. Builds up suspense and weaves narratives well. Some complain about lackluster villains, but I've loved them.
B005F3XV62|5|Funny movie! Love Kevin James.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I like how the objects move
0887307280|5|Best book for new business. Everyone who starts a new business needs to read this book and follow its directions.
0596007124|5|Design Patterns is a rather dry subject.  This book however presents the concepts with very good real world examples in easy to understand terms.
B00AZMFO6I|5|thanks
B00DVKOYBM|4|This is a fun game to pass time.
1878424602|4|Great book. Very insightful. Deepak Chropra is the master of yoga and spiritual life. This is my first time at yoga and this book has made me a fan forever. Thank you.
031606792X|5|I don't understand the negative reviews!  I just finished Breaking Dawn last night and I am completely happy with it.  Maybe this has something to do with the fact that I am the last person on Earth to start this series and I just devoured all four books in the saga over the last 2 weeks?  I loved that Ms. Meyer chose to give Jacob his own chapter - it was fun to hear his voice and know everything he was thinking (and I cannot WAIT for Edward's book to come out).  Don't buy into the negativity - the book has it all.  It is an amazing end to the saga.
B00F8L2VO4|5|This is one of my favorite apps on my phone, I'm glad they also brought it to the Kindle. The amount of content that you get is absolutely mind-boggling, and even better...it's free! For a language-learning app of this quality, I could easily imagine paying at least $10 for a single language, but this lets you learn 5 and all you have to spend is your time. As others have mentioned though, there are some nuances to the languages that can be difficult to acquire if you're just using Duolingo, but I do feel like it gives you a fantastic foundation in the languages. My only advice for the developers: please please please add in Japanese! If you do I will go straight to your site and donate. I love the variety of languages so far but it'd be great to have some of the Asian languages such as Chinese, Russian, maybe even Arabic! Anyways, to the potential consumer out there: get this app, you'll be far from disappointed!
B00E8KLWB4|3|I'm a little disappointed. This game goes an extra step by hiding objects BEHIND the scenery where only a little piece will be visible. That feels like cheating and forces me to use in-game tools, which are rare or available for purchase. I've played these games before and the items are hidden ways such as changing the color intensity, size, or orientation (rotation) of the item to hide it in the scenery, but the items are always fully visible, yet cleverly hidden. This game does all that, but also hides them behind things, so you never really know what you're looking for (color/size/orientation, and NOW adding in whether you'll just see a sliver of it or not).
B00O1GGAZI|5|Worth it for the bonus material alone. The Live at The Matrix discs are a revelation.
B00KGEQYNW|4|I decided to load these puzzles on my Kindle mainly for my grandsons to play while we went on a long plane trip.  It added another interesting activity besides video games that kept them busy. (Florida is a long way away from Oregon!)  They really enjoyed doing them.  They are 5 and 8 years old.
0061122416|5|I chose this rate because it was well written. Coelho had great philosophy while writing the book and it had me thinking about my own life by applying the laws of karma into my life.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is pretty awesome for free or paid!  I cant put it down! Get it! Get it now!!!<br />Minions rule!!
B00AESN8XY|5|This game is demented but really really fun I highly recommend this game and creators go get help seriously
B00H71PBQ8|5|Same excellent script and cast.
B00HCMG6LG|5|Fun and keeps me on task.  I do like the help option of video  walk through's when I am stumped.
B000002JS8|5|This is unfortunately the last Bon Scott album, dont get me wrong I loved Brian Johnson and I thought he was the next best thing but Bon Scotts words reached me and he's one of the reasons why I'm a rock fan. The song 'Highway to Hell' perfectly describes the band after this album. This was their best, then after the massive sell-out yet awesome 'Back in Black' the downfall began: 'For those about to rock' was their second and last good eighties album then after the terrible 'Who Made Who?' we wouldn't see a good AC\DC album until 'Razors Edge', then the ninties downfall would begin and after 'Ballbreaker' I had had it. During the Bon Scott era however all their albums rocked my ass, 'High Voltage' and 'If You Want Blood' are among my favorite seventies albums.  <br />  Okay back to this album. Bon Scott has truly done it again here, him and Angus Young are the perfect duo when comes to leading the band. The rhythem is awesome as well with Malcolm Young on guitar, Cliff Williams on bass and Phil Rudd on drums and they all build the perfect foundation for each song. This is an essential hard rock album for, well... hard rock. Buy this masterpiece as well as 'Back in Black', 'High Voltage', 'For those about to Rock (We Salute You)' and 'If you want Blood (You got it)'.
B004J4WKTW|5|This is a must read.  Enchanting, magical, beautifully written.  If and when it comes out in a movie I'll be the first in line.  Loved it!!!
B0040UAYI4|4|It is good but is a bit tricky to calibrate it. There are videos on youtube and files that you can download to help calibrate.
B00SH00N3Y|1|Dumbest movie I've seen....
B005LAIH4A|5|This is a remake of the every popular Dr. Seuss story The Lorax.<br /><br />The Lorax is a must watch for *everyone* for the environmental message contained within regarding over consumption and unnecessary waste caused by squandering resources which is devastating the environment (ie the carbon footprint.)  This rendition is a refreshing update to the previously returned animated feature.<br /><br />I am so enthralled with The Lorax and feel the message is important enough for the next generation that I bought extra copies for each household of our grandchildren.
B002S45V32|2|Dull, predictable, and slow.  Nostalgic to watch these young actors before they hit their prime, but otherwise should be skipped.
B005PK1G76|5|Bought for city mini double stroller. Had trouble getting it to stay in place so bought the Britax organizer for the other side which works great and holds this one in place. I use both on it.
B00EY7MFKS|5|Unlike other reviewers and bloggers I've seen online, I liked SHIELD from the very beginning.  I liked watching the development of the characters and the interactions between them.
B0086700CM|4|Downloaded for my little nieces and nephews to play with.  The older ones have enjoyed the Temple Run game especially.
B005Q1W0ZQ|3|I loved season 1, but season 2 had so much soap opera melodrama, it was almost laughable . From the officer impregnating the house maid to Matthew' s &#34;Miraculous&#34; cure so he was no longer crippled, to Lavinia' s &#34;convenient death from the Spanish flu, I thought I was watching a Mexican reflexively . excessively cornet!
B00005JNBQ|1|After being sentenced to exile in a past full of retards by the   Mc'Donalds coorperation, I decided to locate my grampa and his kindred. What I found was a room full of fools watching this movie. This terrible movie! Where is the point in the actors, charactors, or worst of all for this lame excuse for a comedy: Where is the humor? In the behind the scenes someone boasts that \\"We made a good clean cut comedy with nothing vulgar.\\" That is just an admittance that is wasint funny! I laughed only once. It was when napoleon failed his bike ramp, but that was because I thought he just died and the credits would roll! I was too lazy to get up and turn this (...) off. They say you need to watch it twice, which is when the secret subliminal rewiring takes root in you mind! You can watch Bob Saget a 1000 times and  it only gets worse. Did he write this movie too?   The point is this: \\"why would you punish yourself again?\\" This train of thought is why people in the future call you \\"the generation we do not speak of\\" ,bad apples taking dumps on film. This idea was sooooooooo simple and lacked any filler. A whole nation is bowing before their \\"vision\\" I could have written this film. So could you or anyone. Does that make it art? NO! But it makes it a gimmick! Now If you want magnificence, listen to some michael Bolton. People in the future cant get enough of the old recordings of our dictator! My grampa said everyone at his job begged him to see it. I told him that they were possibly trying to dupe him into blowing his weekly welfare budget, and they would all secretly laugh at him if he said it was a \\"Funny\\" movie. (which is what they might be doing to you if you admit you watched it) In the year 2015 The Great Wall(CO.Wal-mart inc all rights reserved) is built, those who like this movie are on one side, those who don't are on the other. Dont be foolish enough to forfeight your grandchildren's burger rations. They'll dig up old blockbuster rental records and find you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000OYC3J8|5|It's back!...........Extra! Extra! Read all about it!  New White Stripes Album OWNS!  *excited look*  This isn't some lame attempt to be poppy or to appease the masses, this is raw, original, downright ROCK!  Jack White's talents are right on the money, nasty slides, great riffs, with his unique vocals to back it up.  This is such a vintage effort here with a twist of \\"expanding horizons\\".  Bringin' back the old is what it's all about, and made the sound so original.  Explore the rock Ladies and Gents.
B005LAJ1O0|4|I watched this originally on fx  years ago.  I loved it so much i introduced all of my friends.  I recently purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it! Amazon was great, it shipped super fast and now we can watch it together!

B000W00Y0Y|5|When I first saw this presentation on the Voom Networks' \\"Rave HD\\" channel, I was absolutely blown away. Amazing performance, awesome camera work - what a show. I'm only 24 years old, and never really was around to enjoy Queen in their prime-time, but this Blu-Ray really put me back into what I can imagine those days were like. Absolutely amazing performance! Worth every penny I spent!
B00HVJB4VM|5|I'd heard of this one on NPR and never really intended to read it - high finance is supposed to be boring and esoteric, and who wants to read that? - but the title kept coming up in conversation, on sites, and on NPR, so I gave it a shot.<br />Not boring, and Lewis goes to decent lengths to explain the more esoteric parts. This book overall is a good entry-level window on the stock market, what's changed, what's wrong with it, and how it can work right. Even better, it's wrapped in an engaging little mystery - why does purchasing a small brick of  stock make the remaining stock out there disappear? For traders, this is a critical issue. The answer is some joker getting in front of the stock, but that just opens the door to even more questions...<br /><br />Lewis builds a great story. He had a lot of potentially dry ground to cover, yet he manages to keep the story interesting by finding the high points, explaining the difficult parts, and letting his characters tell their own stories. This isn't fiction but it reads like it could be. I found the ending to be a little abrupt and I would really like some follow-up information on how things came out - an epilogue would be awesome - but overall I enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />If you have investments, a 401k, insurance, or any other financial instrument that is subjected to the whims of Wall Street, take a look. You may not be glad you did, but you'll be educated.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4|I love this game, But it wouldn't let me load my world. Plz fix
B004QZ9PLU|5|What a great read\\"\\"\\" loved the story!!! Nicholas Sparks does it again! Couldn't put the book down! Definite keeper for the library!
B004ECDNJU|1|I don't like it. it has a lot of minor bugs.... I would give it 0 stars if I could.
B007MNV5WU|4|I thought this would be more fun & challenging but I easily conquered the levels faster than the original game.
B000HEVALC|4|it was really cool hearing the icons of the beginning of american rock & roll jam.  i particularly liked the gospel music which was & still is an important contribution  in the grand old opry tradition.
B007D5DUBG|5|I think the best song on this EP was Hit Me Like A Man, Under The Water being a close second. If this is any indication of what the next album is going to be like, it seems pretty impressive. The older material is all live and is as just as good as it was on the original recordings.
B000AYQNYI|5|It is a classic record and now you have the video's on the other side. <br />It sends me back in time and I just love it!!!!!
B00004RHZU|5|No one has made an R&B debut that has impressed me half as much as Pink. Here's why:<br />1. Split Personality- \\"You don't know me well enough to label me sick, or even disturbed..\\" What a way to start an album! It surprises with it's quirky beat, fresh two-sided thoughts from Pink's spilt personality. \\"Everybody's got his ennities, I got a split personality.\\" #1 potenetial, shocking look at life. <br />2. Hell Wit' Ya- \\"Yeah, I remember that time we went to Pizza Hut, you told me she was your cousin.\\" Talks about a lousy player who doesn't know how to treat the girl who cares about him (Pink)  For anyone and everyone who's been in a bad relationship. <br />3. Most Girls- Her terrific #1 song. Most girls may want moolah, but Pink just wants real love. If you haven't heard it, you have to. Also check out her singles for \\"Most Girls,\\" they include some really great mixes. <br />4. There You Go- The song that started it all for this beautiful new diva. A #1 better than any Britney song you've ever heard. Also check out the single for this one. Dare you not to sing along! <br />5. You Make Me Sick- Pink's latest #1. I mean, how hot is this song? \\"You make me sick, I want you and I'm hatin' it!\\" \\"You got me goin' again, baby you got me goin' again.\\" A little hard to understand at first. I think you'll love it once you give it a try. Hate to be repetative, but check out this single, too. REALLY awesome mixes. *****<br />6.Let Me Let You Know- This is some REAL R&B stuff here. Not a personal favorite, but a good song to unwind with.  <br />7. Love is such a Crazy Thing- The classical piano intro, the sultry guitar, the funky strings and drums. Oh, what a song! Pink confesses her love in this one, a break from the girl power theme, \\"Is this love for real?\\" Very nicely suited to her range. <br />8. Private Show- This is my favorite song of the album, and just listen to it once to see why. \\"See I don't wanna meet on a lonely street, where the talk is cheap and the price is sweet..... And you don't wanna see the other side of me so I'm gonna hit you off and I'ma set you free before you fall too deep.\\" What more is there to say? <br />9. Can't Take Me Home- Okay, a lot of the \\"F Word\\" in here, but it's understandable. As I've pointed out, the fact that this is the song the album is named after says a lot about Pink's personality. Or at least one of them. This one can take a while to grow on you. <br />10.Stop Falling- Who can resist the vocals in this? Pink's sexy, scartchy voice, and her sad tone and sad story her song tells will move you. I think the climax where she shows off her range is wonderful! <br />11.Do What U Do- Hey, whatever you're comfortable doing, do it! Directed to anyone and everyone. However you are, be comfortable with it. Great message, the tune could use a little work. ****<br />12. Hiccup- \\"Why every time I try to tell you how I feel, it's like a hiccup-cup-cup it just won't come come.\\" Such a different song from anything else out there. \\"Pink don't think before she speak, but you got me feelin' feelin' feelin' kinda weak\\" ****<br />13.Is It Love-  Oh, my! Pink is in love- she thinks, but she's not sure what's up with her man. One of my favorite songs, from this album or any other! *****

B00003CWTI|5|After Hard Eight and Boogie Nights, it wasn't immediately clear what direction P.T. Anderson would take. Many people wouldn't believe him capable to make a masterpiece, but it DID happen

6300214540|4|Can anybody think of military aviation, the late 1980's, patch-covered leather jackets or patriotic rousing boffo blockbuster flicks and not think of this flick? In the story, Tom \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell is the typical bad-boy fighter pilot, a naturally gifted fighter-driver lacking any trace of discipline.  Haunted by the mysterious fate of his father who was lost flying a Navy Phantom over North Vietnam, Mav is driven to succeed - even if that requires him to make high-speed passes over control towers, carrier decks and admirals' daughters.  When he and a wingman intercept a pair of \\"MiG-28's\\" over the Indian Ocean (real MiGs are odd-numbered only),. Mav is tagged to go for \\"Top Gun\\", the Navy's elite fighter-pilot school.  There his strengths and his weaknesses as an F-14 driver become painfully clear to everybody, especially the school's top ace, \\"Viper\\" Metcalfe (Tom Skerrit) and fellow-student \\"Iceman\\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer).  In a paint-by-numbers script, Mav falls for Top Gun's civilian analyst (Kelly Mcgillis), loses his close friend \\"Goose\\" (a pre-ER Anthony Edwards) in an freak mid-air accident, learns to doubt himself, grow up and become a real Top Gun in time for a climactic battle between a sextet of the evil MiG-28's.  <br />So why is this movie so important?  Why not try asking anybody who's tried to follow-up this aero-classic using real airplanes and not CGI.  15 years later aerial footage from both this film and \\"Iron Eagle\\" are still used as stock, though it's clear that TG's is better, and nobody has even come close to surpassing it, CGI or otherwise.  Though the plot is easily dismissed as unrealistic, the flight scenes go above and beyond in conveying the speed and gravity of these airplanes - especially the F-14 which is among the largest fighters in the world.  (The F-14's large size is a liability in real combat, but also makes the plane much more cinematic than smaller jets like the Hornet or the F-16).  Nothing is easy for these guys (and thefatal spin near the film's climax superlatively shows just how dangerous a job it is).  Patriotic?  How evil!  Actually, though a tribute to real fighter-drivers, this flick isn't really all that jingoistic (unless you're the type who feels that the sight of any military hardware is necessarily jingoistic), and the mysterious nature of the dreaded MiGs is further proof of no flag-waving.  (MiG's are Russian, but the Exocet missiles they carry are French; The Russians had no aircraft carriers capable of launching true fighter-jets until the end of the cold-war, and probably had few of their own airbases on the Indian Ocean in the mid 1980's.)  A simple plot?  Sure, but better than something convoluted.  On the clearly plus side, the special effects are matchless, the sound and editing are tops and the photography (in which southern California skies are purple, and even sunlight looks liquid) is simply beautiful.  The editing really makes the film - with flight scenes cut so quickly that you never realize how slow the mammoth F-14's are really flying.   I'd get this film in wide-screen to bring out the effects.  If you feel the need for speed - don't be cheap.
B00KA87GCW|4|So far it has my attention
B004XDYJRU|5|What a fantastic app. It quite literally does stream practically everything out there from local stations around the world to thousands of shoutcast streams to podcasts. It's even got dvr-like functionality allowing you to pause, fast forward, rewind and even record. Shows album art and program schedules where supported and also has a great alarm function. The only radio streams this doesn't do are last.fm and pandora but that's totally understandable and acceptable given all that this already converges together and presents in a beautiful and intuitive user interface. My elderly mother could work this app without much coaching so it's dead simple. Spend a buck, these guys deserve it and you wont regret it. I got this on amazon when it was free and I wish I could pay for it now because its so good.
B005MYEQ4U|5|Loved it. Not usually a fan of Woody Allen, but I saw this in cinemas and fell in love with it. Highly recommend owning it.
B00CWY76CC|4|Enjoyed the game was challening enough to hold interest.  Not so difficult you get frustrated.  I wish it had been longer but since it was free can't complain.
B0094BB4TW|1|It appears that there is an update for this app. It will not install the update, nor will it open anymore! Very disappointed. Please fix and will revise this rating. I can't give anything more than one star for an app that will not open or update.

0307577589|5|AUDIOBOOK PRODUCT REVIEW<br />Let me start out by saying that the reason I'm only giving three stars is because I'm only reviewing the AUDIOBOOK PRODUCT  (as these are the product review pages).<br /><br />Simon Vance is a very good reader.  As a narrator he does great job of putting the emphasis where it belongs in each sentence and paragraph. With dialogue he gives each character a unique voice and he totally embodies the voices he chooses.  Since this is a translation I actually think I enjoyed having it read to me more than if I had read it in book form because I may have (just like with Tolkien) had the flow of reading interrupted by all those foreign place names and character names. Simon Vance speaks these with ease.<br /><br />If you are a consumer who intends to rip the audiobook CDs to your digital device there is something you need to know.  The tracks on the CDs are seemingly purposely tagged in a disordered fashion.  For example, when I ripped CDs 1, 3 and 4 on Itunes they ended up in the directory under /Stieg Larsson/The Girl With the Dragon Tatto.  When I ripped CDs 2,5 and 6 they ended up in the directory under /Compilations/Simon Vance/CD Tattoo.  The metadata on the tracks is not the same on every CD.  So once you rip the CDs you have to select all the tracks and re-enter the metadata to your liking so that all 13 CDs will have the same information.  It's tedious but not undoable.<br /><br />BOOK REVIEW<br />I was riveted to through my entire listen to this book.  I found the non-mystery related exposition on the state of financial journalism interesting and very timely.  I found the side story regarding machinations at Millenium magazine very interesting.<br /><br />I didn't find the mystery very mysterious but I still enjoyed listening to the characters work through all of it.  I enjoyed learning about the rotten backstory of the rich industrialist family.  I enjoyed listening as the journalist worked through different clues.  I also liked the jump between scenes of the hero and heroine.<br /><br />I especially liked the social commentary on Sweden's mental health/social services system.  I liked how Lisbeth, with her \\"issues\\", was an embodiment of what happens to people when they are thrown around by \\"the system\\". But I also like how, even though she was thrown around by the system, she was not a victim.oine.    I especially liked the social commentary on Sweden's mental health/social services system.

B0064MPXFA|5|Very entertaining!  Real life situations with subtle humor.
B0083ZBW2Y|4|I thought it would be boring because it was a summer reading book but it was very good. A little confused a time though
1451695195|5|This is a clear presentation of one man's experience with life after life.  I enjoyed how this writer had been a skeptic and now is convinced that there is life after life.  He regrets having not believed in the experiences some of his patients reported to him.  He considered them fantasies until he had his own personal experience when he was dead.  An excellent read.
0439023521|5|I just read the last page of the third book tonight and felt moved to write this.  There is no question that The Hunger Games is a fantastic and powerful series and that Suzanne Collins is brilliant.  The series is marketed as Young Adult Literature.  Just be aware: by no stretch of the imagination are these children's books.  They are fast paced and suspenseful, and tell of the best and worst of which humanity is capable.  The literary and historical references are plentiful.  But they are utterly gut wrenching in the description of Man's cruelty and inhumanity.  Fairytales are scary, but this is not a fairytale.  Without reservation, I highly recommend the series to adults.  I have just finished the series, and my highly literate 6th grader is already nearly finished the first book.  Now that she's already well into the series, I will let her continue, but probably warn her of some things coming up.  I find myself doing a lot of  hand holding and nightmare control.  It does elicit some deep discussions, though.  Just be aware.
B005HF0BIE|5|Continuing saga of King Henry the 8th, Well done and captivating. History or non history buffs will love it.
B0000028M7|5|this is truly a great cd with great acoustics and lyrics they give a top performance with no exceptions. if you like them, you will like this.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Supremely interesting
B00Q7WBFTA|5|I have been a fan of Into the Woods since I saw the original production in 1988. I was afraid that a new film production could never be as good. One of the rare times that a stage production is successfully brought to the screen. Love the album and love the video and they gets better with repetition, so many golden nuggets sprinkled everywhere.
B00DL48CN4|5|Very interesting play on the real-life story.  Very entertaining.
B00G5G7EXY|4|My daughter loves it!
B0030DHPGQ|4|What a great way to simplify Change without tedious and often painful meetings, GANT charts and boring lectures.  Staring to the. Why
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Awesome
B00005JMYG|1|Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell and Christina Appelgate but they just werent thinking when they made this movie.  Anchorman goes beyond dumb comedy and into complete stupidity.  Very sad for the amount of good actors that made appearances.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|Pixel gun 3D is very cool but it kind of lags but I don't care it is a very fun game<br />buy it now it is free I have it and the best way to get coins is survival

6305428042|4|This is good halloween movie. Halloween is the best time to watch this.<br />Sarah Jessica Parker & Bette milder are great !
B003B2H3MC|4|The first question has to be why pay this much for a campy movie based on a popular comic?     The answer is simple: the movie is not only fun but in the original Cinemascope aspect is sharp and beautifully detailed. Add to that the remarkable clarity of the soundtrack and you have a real pleasure. I purchased the Black Shield of Falworth issed by Eureka and now that I've seen a second example of their product quality, I have to say that they have an excellent offering here and look forward to more titles.     Here's the flaws: portions of the movie, particularly the opening titles suffer from \\"frame jitter\\" (the image moves horizontally slightly, but it is obvious). I also had image \\"sparkling\\" at the 1080p setting on my video cards, which disappeared at the lower 720p.     Nothing is perfect but after seeing this, the old copies I have of this movie won't be watched. It is that superior.
B00N1ZCGWG|5|I love this game! You have defeat the bad pigs by knocking them over and there are seven characters you can use in here and each of them have a special power to help you finish the level, there are no problems with this game so far so if you're thinking about getting this app don't hesitate!
B0010SEMP0|5|I was kind of worried when I started the first book which I checked out from my library in case I didn't like it but I did so after I finished that I immediately started this one yesterday and it was sooo good. I'm really excited to start the next one!
0887307280|4|I haven't finished the book yet, but it was suggested for my real estate business.  Hope it starts relating more soon.
B006VFLIYK|5|Well written and depicting a new action hero / government assassin with a conscience. Hope this is a new series of books from DB.
B00K0CRMPY|4|The voice dubbing for the most part was pretty good.<br />The movie has excellent graphics, the plot is a little think, but decent.
B003H9M1Q2|5|I loved this movie when I was a kid....my kids loved it too...and now my grandkids love it.
B00CWY76CC|5|I don't normally like apps that much but this one is so much fun and so flipping addicting! I would HIGHLY suggest getting this app!
B002MW50KO|5|As always, Dylan delivers.  His fans will love it, his detractors won't.  But what would I want with a Dylan album the latter loved anyway?
B001TKD4ZI|4|I enjoed this story and world enough that I have the original paperbook and now kindle versions. I recommend this book and the series!
B00BUCXVPI|2|Very predictable.  Bad performance by Cruise.<br />it might have been good with another lead actor.<br />It did not live up to the book
B00005JPLW|1|This has nothing to do with the movie. The movie itself is Great!  I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault but when I receive the movie it has fingerprints on it. I originally bought this on black friday and I bought it as brand new but when I received the DVD it is clearly used and has a lot of  fingerprints and scratches. Just HORRIBLE!!! NOT ACCEPTABLE!!! BUYERS BEWARE!
B000YHE4AG|4|Always funny
B00SXK316E|5|I love this story and it translated to the series so well from the books.  The casting is brilliant, the cinematography, costumes and scenery is spot on.  I enjoyed the books so much and enjoy this video series just as much.
B002KSPKRS|5|I was shopping around for a game headset as I have a little one and a wife who likes to go to bed well before I do / nap on the couch occasionally.  As any gamer knows, the audio is half the experience, especially when you need to hear if someone is sneaking up behind you.    I shopped around for a bit, debating heavily between this headset and the Tritton AX Pro.  A friend of mine has the Trittons and said that I would be a fool to buy the x41s as they get hit with tons of interference and static/popping.  I couldn't really imagine being tethered to my console with a bunch of wires, and I read some other reviews online with viewpoints contrary to his, so I decided to give the x41s a shot.    Before I did, I contacted Amazon's returns department to ensure that I would have no problems returning the headset if they did not perform satisfactorily.  I was assured it would not be a problem, so I ordered them that day.    I am glad I did!  This headset is fantastic.  For brevity's sake here are the pros and cons.    Pros:  -Lightweight - I usually don't even realize I have them on    -Great sound - I was instantly impressed by the quality of the audio as well as how much I could actually hear.  There are sounds in Modern Warfare 2 that I didn't even realize were in the game.  In complete silence you hear the creaking of metal, background noises, etc.  In the heat of battle, you can hear people sneaking up on you.  Anyone I have let try the headset on, gamers and otherwise, simply say \\"Wow\\"    -Hardly any interference at all - I live in an area saturated with WiFi routers.  I can see about 10 routers from my house if I perform a wireless survey.  I also have a wireless game adapter running on the same 2.4 GHz band literally one foot from the x41 transmitter.  I rarely get interference, and if I do it lasts just a second.  The x41s frequency hop (like your old cordless phone) to ensure interference-free communications    -Absolutely silent gaming - Like I mentioned, my wife likes to nap on the couch on occasion.  Typically, I would go find something else to do, or game in almost complete silence.  Now, I just put on my headset, and off I go.    Cons:  -Even though the headset is lightweight, I do get some pain in my ears when wearing my glasses.  I only put them on late at night, but it hurts when I take the headset off.  It's a trade-off I am willing to make.    -The optical cable that comes with the unit seems pretty thin and cheap.  I would pick up a new one from one of Amazon's vendors - you can probably find a good quality cable for about $3-5    -The microphone monitoring is a bit weak.  Even with the chat volume cranked, I can hardly hear myself when talking to others in my party.  It's partly because the boom is not quite long enough to reach directly in front of my mouth, but nonetheless I find myself asking party members if they can hear me, because I can barely hear myself.  The one positive is that they always respond that they can hear me loud and clear.      In the end, I am extremely happy I purchased this headset, I would recommend it to anyone.    A final note:    Many people complain that there is a ton of interference and popping with this headset.  This is likely related to one of two things.    1) A WiFi radio way too close to the headset.  If I happen to have my notebook pc right in my lap downloading a large file I will get interference.  That is to be expected with two WiFi radios so close together, so you can't really count that.    2) Batteries.  People often let the batteries run out completely before changing.  I have done it once and started to receive interference for the last 10 minutes the headset ran before turning off completely.  As long as you replace your batteries as they run out, you will barely get any interference.  I recommend buying a set of 4 rechargeable AAA batteries so you always have some on hand for a quick swap.
B004H4XI5O|2|what a waste of time! here i was trying to get a book which will help improve my memory and i ended up with a biography of joshua foer. and even the biography wanders in so many directions! the only reason i read the book through was that i wanted to know if the author has buried the tips in some corner! sadly, it was not to be. the technique used by him, unfortunately, is not for ordinary people like me. when i cant remember simple things how am i going to remember places and link poems/ideas to them? one thing though - i am now determined to stay away from memory books for ever and ever. thanks mr foer.
B00BZA7M5A|1|Too much vulgarity...could not watch it.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Exciting, thrilling, if you loved the movies like Gravity or Apollo13, this is a must read. Hope it becomes a movie
B001F6ZIXW|5|Love it !!! Watched through season 6 in 2 weeks !
B00GSAC1UI|3|Very competent arrangements and performances--this group has a fine blend of voices. Little Drummer Boy is a standout with an effective build. But for the most part, it's a bunch of pretty good a capella arrangements of safe, traditional material.
B00E5Q1LTY|4|Good flick.  Not as good as the first one though.  Chris Pine was born to play this role he was great
B0049H9NVW|5|These game is amazing! There a lot of cool mechanics in this game that I haven't seen before. The artwork in the game looks. Even the front of the rule book has a fun comic to explain the story behind the game. The rules only took about 10 minutes to learn and teach. Even though the rules are simple, the strategy can be very complex and that's what makes a good board game. I highly recomend Takenoko.
B002VECM6S|5|Love Sandra Bullock. great movie, would recommend it to everyone to own or watch, based on a true story also
B004MC8CA2|5|If you wanted to know of who you are. And who is your Father in Heaven, I would tell you trust and believe that God is real. I dare you to chanegllen yourself your soul, your heart.  Give it to Jesus Christ Lord of All the Earth.
B006O6F932|5|7 year old loved it! Nice quality and it folds up neatly when not in use. I would recommend it.
1451695195|5|For years I've believed that when a person dies, that's it;  dust to dust, ashes to ashes.  But after reading Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven, I'm a believer!  There have been many others who have experienced life after death, then come back to tell about it.  This is the first time I read about one man's experience of the afterlife.  It's a very scientifically and technically written book, and after reading it, I started talking about it.  I've had several people, including my own dad, tell me of the same experience that Alexander had.  This is a wonderful book, very well-written.  I highly recommend it.
0345363132|5|My first Penman book. {Is that a play on words?} I love it!!!! I am going to start a study of English history if it is half as exciting as the author has hinted.

B00BHHIWQO|5|The game is faster here than in my pc. It's fun and can be connected to your facebook account and play against friends and all.
B00ECU2SGS|4|Really liked it and thought the actors were believable even though there were parts that were a bit far fetched.
B0053O89WY|5|This is hilarious. I have a great time atching this comedy. They are professional actors and smart guys and gals. They have a sofisticated touch on each play.
B00005QDW1|5|No Doubt's latest, Rock Steady, is brilliant.  No Doubt always has an incredible knack for creating fresh, catchy tunes, and this album is no exception.  They combine all sorts of crazy genres into one album, creating an album that is truly unique.  There's pop, there's rock, there's R &amp; B, there's reggae, there's disco, there's electronica...and more, all combined with the flair of No Doubt that makes every one of their albums a great listen.  The lyrics are great, as usual, and I honestly play the CD over and over again.  I can't get enough of it.  The end of the CD has me craving more.
0767020308|4|This is relatively true to the book, much moreso than the Paltrow version. However, like the book, it may be a bit heavy for some viewers. They won't, for example, see Mr. Knightley as a romantic hero. The acting is good, and the story is great. It's a wonderful way to introduce someone to this work, by Ms. Austen, and would be wonderfully paired with something like Clueless, so that one can see how the story transcends time.<br /><br />(*)>

B00005JLXE|3|If I could give this film 3 1/2 stars, I would. First, Daredevil is one of my favorite Marvel characters. Its one of those rare comic vehicles that attracted the cream of the crop: from Frank Miller to Harlan Ellison. It is still a great read, but how is the film compared to the comic? Well, it is so-so. Ben Affleck did a decent job as Matt Murdoch, the costume looked good, but the character who played Electra did a poor job (I forget her name). <br />     Colin Farrell stole the show (as expected) as Bullseye; the fight scenes were OK but some of them were poorly filmed, the lighting was insufficient and you could'nt really tell what was going on. However the movie was pretty faithful to the original comic story. I say \\"original\\" because none of the Frank Miller storyline was used: Matt's mentor, Stick, or the Hand. That was disappointing but the storyline focusing on Daredevil's origin and his father was compelling.<br />  Will they make a sequel? Probably, the producers should make one, maybe next time they'll have Frank Miller help with the script.

B005LAIIKI|5|I join the overwhelming number of viewers who really enjoyed this western. It is filled with all the things that people like me enjoy: excitement, humor, suspense, action, and a good plot line that is different than what we usually see. It was also interesting to see quite a few actors who I had seen in other roles sometime back appearing in this film. I also found it interesting to watch the machinations of the black house slave who was supporting his owner, something that is understandable but unusual in a film and the hero allowing a slave to be killed in a brutal manner so as not to expose his hinder what he wanted to accomplish.
B00G5G7K7O|5|My daughter loves this movie!  The item arrived on time and undamaged.
B0000029DD|5|Ok, I am not a fan of music reviews. generally people feel moved to write a review because they love the album in question. Result? No objectivity whatsoever. Anyway, I am going to gush myself. There are few albums from the '90's which could be labled as classics. However, this is one of them. A stone-cold classic. If you disagree, I will utter only one sentence to you: you are wrong.
B005HEVBGG|5|The next generation is on quite a bit in my town, but Voyager no longer is, not even on cable so it was good to be able to see this show again, after a few years. So if your a Trek fan like i am, add this to you video library, to watch when you want. The price is right and the quality unbeatable, so spend some time with old friends.

B009LK6JS2|1|horrable app waste oftime and effort will never order again does not work loaded me up with spam and all kinda stuff sorry nbut thats the truth !!!!
B00846REIS|1|This is one of the worse books I have ever read!  The story goes no where.  There is no plot, nothing.  The family the author writes about are each dealing with their own issues, but there is no real story.  The suicide part of the book touched me deeply, as I lost a child to suicide.  Other than that, I wouldn't read another book by this author.  Empty, boring reading.
B00A2BTCXI|5|Great album!!
B00VFTA70I|4|Exceptional story
1451648537|5|Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs lands with a solid, weighty thud.  In fitting tribute, it is a painstakingly-designed product that conveys the Steve Jobs experience.  From the discomforting Jobs stare on the front cover to the final chapter that insists on giving Jobs the last word, it looks and feels like Jobs.<br /><br />Isaacson does the usual bio stuff.  We get capsule sketches of Jobs' birth parents, of his adoptive parents, and of some influential adults from his childhood.  Anecdotes from the teen years uncover the roots of his interests in technology, his love of good design and careful craftsmanship, and his near-obsessive attention to detail.  We see the roots of the darker Jobs, too.  He was a black-and-white thinker, seeing everything as either \\"$#!+\\" or insanely great, sometimes in rapid alternation.  Steve Jobs saw people this way, too.  Although there are examples of his sensitivity, they are outnumbered by episodes of manipulation, confrontation, and even cruelty.<br /><br />No matter how outrageous his behavior, we overlook it, minimize it, even revel in it.  And we try to understand how it underlies his achievements.  The Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad...revolutions in personal computing, computer animation, and the music industry.  And--clich&eacute; that it is, it has to be said again--starting Apple Computer in a garage and shepherding its growth into the largest and most profitable company on the planet.  Isaacson's book helps us understand Steve Jobs' personality, his management style, his design philosophy, and his relentless drive for perfect products.<br /><br />A brief story gives a sense of Jobs, his friend-and-foe relationship with Bill Gates, and the book's overall tone.  Soon after iTunes for Windows was released, Jobs told the press that it was like \\"offering a glass of ice water to people in Hell.\\"  Infuriated by this latest swipe at Microsoft, Gates encountered Jobs behind stage at a conference.  \\"So I am the representative from Hell?\\" he fumed.  Jobs was startled, then grinned broadly and handed Gates a chilled bottle of water from the nearby refreshment table.  And Gates laughed.<br /><br />I don't know what Steve Jobs thought of this book.  I suspect he approved, then disapproved, then demanded a chance to do it over completely.  And then suddenly he loved it and believed he wrote it himself.  Well, he did, really.  Nicely done, Walter Isaacson.  Nicely done.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended to everyone influenced by Steve Jobs and his creations.artled, then grinned broadly and handed Gates a chilled bottle of water from the nearby refreshment table.

B00A50PDDY|5|My husband and I won tickets to see 21 Pilots from a radio station and before we went I had only heard Holding on to You. We listened to a few tracks on the way to the show are were both quite excited to see them. Needless to say, the show was fantastic and this album is truly amazing. I haven't found new music in quite some time and I'm so glad we won those tickets or I may have never known the awesomness that is this band and this album.<br /><br />I'm positive I will be listening to this one for years. It's almost impossible to chose a favorite song as they are all great but I would say I'm tied up for Guns for Hands, Migraine and Ode to Sleep. I completely agree with the other reviewers that the right song was picked for this album opener and it only gets better from there. If you are on the fence about buying this one, jump off and click purchase, it's more than worth it.
B00000J7JO|4|This is the Chili Peppers best so far. The vocals are great and the music funky. Porcelin, and Californication are the two main highlights for me, but overall a very solid album

B00FAPF5U0|5|Well, I've been having quite alot of fun playing this game. It's a great way to waste time and entertain yourself. I really recommend that you get this game for a good time.
B002RVCD6O|3|I was going to give this movie more stars, because even with the stupid stuff they added in that NEVER happened in the book, while leaving out or totally twisting other story lines, there were some great parts (I especially loved Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry on Felix Felicis, so funny!!)and I still love to see the books come to life ...BUT - The fact that they didn't have Dumbledore petrify Harry and instead had Harry willingly stand there without trying to help Dumbledore... unforgivable. It's just INSANE that they changed that part :( Harry would have never just stood there, that is why Rowling made Dumbledore petrify him in the first place, it goes against everything in his nature and in the nature of the books & story as a whole.
B005ETA5K2|5|When I ordered one of these I was afraid that I was getting in over my head. How in the world does a USB plug-in thingee improve wi-fi reception? Would I have to go in and do this and do that to the computer so that the original wifi setup and the new one do not conflict? I had visions of receiving a thick booklet of \\"How To Select Routing Codes\\" or some such imaginary nightmare technical setup.  REALITY.  The package came, everything fit together simply, no guesswork. I plugged it into the computer then slipped the mini CD-ROM disc into the player, and it proceeded to start and configure all by its lonesone. Awsome!  The installation complete, I clicked on the screen icon and presto, not two signals appeared, but seven. I chose one and it came in borderline weak (marginal) but it wasn't even there before. Other signals improved from POOR to FAIR.  Dang near plug and play
B009477BOI|4|Fun movie for the whole family. My children aged 4 and 7 were very into the story and had a great time watching it.
B00B1E6FF8|5|Realistic military films CAN be entertaining, but often times do little more than document things with little style or flair. Zero Dark Thirty has plenty of style, even if it isn't as showy as some dumb American audiences would have liked it to be. I loved the strong character arch. It reminded of The Godfather at times, actually (don't all good movies remind us of The Godfather?) The military sequence was done with extreme finesse, and the ending was absolutely amazing. In the hands of a monkey like Micheal Bay, this movie would have been jingoistic and purely dumb action; Bigelow instead uses the hunt for Bin Laden to highlight the effect it had on Maya's life, and how lost she is after it's over. There are no heroes in war. When Bin Laden falls, easily and without much resistance, everyone seems kind of confused: is it really over? The torturing scenes were done tastefully as well. The movie doesn't appear to have anything but a human agenda. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.
0553418025|5|This is a fantastic read. I got the book on Thursday evening and by Saturday evening I was finished. It was a definite page-turner...and science!
B00KF7VWBO|4|This show was great, but I'm not sure if it quite lived up to the hype.  The formula is something we are all familiar with-- an every-man socialite is paired with a prickly sociopathic genius (who has a heart of gold deep down, of course) to solve a mystery together.  That's not to say that this show is some kind of Sherlock Holmes clone, but I'd be lying if I said that this bit doesn't grow tiresome after a while.<br /><br />The best and worst part of the show is Matthew McConaughey.  His portrayal of Rust Cohle is acted brilliantly, but I still couldn't help but roll my eyes during some of the scenes where the dialogue sounds like the ramblings of a stoned philosophy undergrad (perhaps this was its intended effect).  The dynamic between Cohle and his partner, Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson), is complex and believable, which is one of the things that separates True Detective from being just another buddy-cop detective/murder-mystery drama.<br /><br />That's not to say that True Detective should be pigeon-holed as a cop drama, or anything else-- for every cliche that this show borrows, it brings something new to the table.  It takes a while to gain momentum, but season one is only eight hours, so it's not a huge time investment.  It's definitely worth a watch if you can appreciate good television, but its darkness and moral ambiguity may be a turnoff to fans of more traditional buddy-cop/mystery kind of shows.

B00005AR3G|5|Awesome movie! Something that the entire family can enjoy for sure, ...just absolutely adore this movie. David Spade and John Goodman did a wonderful job with these Characters! Great Flick!
B009JZSC9S|5|Great show
B007SYWFRM|5|This game is awesome because you can create your own little or big village and then you can start to expand it far and wide. You can also add or invite your friends into your world and let them see how big your village is compared there's and also have a competition.
B0083P1QUM|5|I like all of Patricia Cornwell's books. Much time has passed since I have read her books  and she did a good job of reintroducing her characters. My interest was held thru the entire book. What they wear or what they eat is a good way  to 'set the scene'  and makes the book more realistic. Read it- you'll thank me later.

0064409422|5|The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a wonderful fantasy book for children around late elementary school, on through adults. It can be enjoyed by all through imagination, and it wisks the reader away from the everyday toubles of the world, into an imaginary land called Narnia. The story follows the lives of three children in England at the time of WWII, who have been sent away to live with a friend of the family, and elderly man. The children find there way, through the threshold of a wardrobe, into the land of Narnia, a land with it's own mystical problems. <BR>The children learn how to solve problems, in a world filled with extrmems of good and evil, and through their journey in Narnia, they mature, and are perpetually touched by the lives of the character in Narnia, and the difficult situations they have faced.<BR>This book teaches wonderful life long lessons that transend from the wardrobe, Narnia, into the real world. Maturity, and the ability to work within a given situation are all present themes in this book. Along with friendship, good vs evil, the power of sacrifice, making decisions, and allowing forgivness of others, eventhough they may have hurt you in one way or another.<BR>I feel as though this book is a valuable resource for children and adulta alike, as well as an enjoyable reading experience. I hope that schools, and parents continue to use it in their curriculum, and in their households ot keep the power of imagination alieve, and ever present in a child's life, through adulthood.
B00N6PD3GE|5|Great Book!
B00005UW9T|5|I have never written a review, but felt compelled to do so when I read the mediocre reviews Anastasia had received so far.  My daughter &amp; I first saw Anastasia in the movie theater &amp; we LOVED it!...the music is some of the best I have ever heard (it is up there with Beauty &amp; the Beast and Lion King.)  There was a song writer and lyricist who wrote all of the songs and they did an awesome job!  We bought the music CD after seeing the movie &amp; we still listen to it.  The movie was great also (the Rasputin character was a little out there &amp; seemed cartoonish, but every good movie has an evil bad guy.)  The detailed palace scenes and the rest of the movie was spectacular.  The rest didn't seem cartoonish at all, but very real.  And who goes to the movies to see reality, we go to see a happy ending!!  I recommend this movie to any family with a 7 to 13 year old girl...and watch it with her, you will enjoy it too  :)<br />Another favorite of ours is Drew Barrymore in Everafter.  Five Stars on that one too.
B006LSZECO|4|Well written with a twist. Glad that I read the book first before I saw the movie. I would read another book from this author.
B00ARHAAZ6|4|If I can be immersed in the story and lose track of time, then it's good.  That happened with this story.  It's a good, fast read.
B001PNVYMO|5|Yes the Pet Shop Boys are one of the very few bands that have delivered consistently good pop records for 25 years. And yes, Yes is one their best albums they have made in that time, dare I say it at least as good as Behaviour. There's great depth here, fantastic dance tracks, majestic melancholy and just brilliant pop music that fit almost as well into today's scene as it would have done 2 decades ago.    There's much for 80's music fans to love; the infectious Did You See Me Coming would not be out of place on a New Order record; Vulnerable could have been lifted straight off Behaviour, but equally Love etc and Pandemonium amongst others could have come at any point since. Amazingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, all the songs on Yes are excellent. My favourite track is King Of Rome, it has that Jealousy feel to it; melancholy in spades; Neil's haunting voice losing nothing in all this time.    20 years ago Yes would have hit the number 1 spot with ease, many of tracks would have got to number 1 in the singles chart too had they been released. Would that be the case now, I wish - where is quality today, so lacking in an \\"Idle\\" world?    This record deserves a wide audience. If you have not discovered the Pet Shop Boys start here and then buy Behaviour, then Please, Actually and Fundamental. You will be rewarded.    If you can grab the extraordinary 2CD limited edition Yes, etc. as it  seems to be disappearing fast. The bonus disc contains a brilliant duet of Neil and Philip Oakey on This Used To Be The Future - it's PSB meets Human League to brilliant effect.  The remaining dub versions of More Than A Dream (Magical dub), Pandemonium (Stars & Sun dub), The Way It Used To Be (Left of Love dub), All Over The World (This is a dub), Vulnerable (Public Eye dub) and Love etc. (Beautiful dub) are all outstanding.     For me the purchase of West End Girls at a record shop off Oxford Street back in the late 80's led to a journey around the world which lasted 20 years and continues today. Yes takes me back over that time, it is on my iPod now and I know I will play it repeatedly over the coming weeks and months.
B005EGXTHG|5|As a second book in a series it was not disappointing at all.  If you enjoyed the first, you'll like the second
B00BAXFECK|1|To much antique things .I am not interested in that.  Also way to much drug and alcohol abuse.  Hard to believe on best seller list so long.
B00JDB4PEY|5|Awesome album...wish he was still here to see how much he fan still love him and enjoy his music !
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Downton Abbey is the best show on television in many, many years. It is interesting and engaging with a cast full of memorable characters.
B009XIXVU6|5|If you liked The Kite Runner you will love this one! So many well developed characters and story lines. Well done.
B0043A0PXU|5|Great arrangement, Annie Lennox did a great job. Enjoy it for the Christmas season.
B00L23RCPU|5|This was a good movie with some comedy and drama both. Just looking at the scenery whether outside or in was interesting and I especially loved the interior shots of the hotel with its delicious colors. The characters were interesting and funny how they interacted at times but also  poignant .It was thought provoking when it ended. Especially liked Adrian Broody in his part. Thumbs up!
B000FVQLQQ|5|Touching film about a genius who suffers from schizophrenia and finds a way to make a life for himself.  Obviously, this topic is way too complicated to fit into a Hollywood 2 hour formula, but this film manages to capture some of the despair and some of the hope without being completely false.
B00BHHIWQO|4|I enjoy these types of games.  It helps your brain functions and allows you to have fun at the same time.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00KIWHYKO|5|Wonderful drawings!  Delightful stories!

B009FZHYKU|5|Saw my first episode of TWD during a marathon on AMC...it was somewhere in the middle of season 2 and spooked me...stopped watching asi don't usually like these kinds of shows. Fast forward to watching season 3 episode 1 on demand...was so drawn in I couldn't stand it...half way through episode 1, h opted onto amazon and order season 1 and 2. By the end of episode 1, season 3, I was heading to Target to buy the DVDs  right then and there because it is THAT GOOD!<br /><br />Just an amazing cast of characters, well written show...for a girly single mom who owns her own business and hates scr ay movies...this is my absolute favorite show hands down
B000O77SRC|5|This is a must have for any action movie lover.  It's a great action movie that you can get away with calling a Holiday classic...
B00BD99JMW|5|All these have been great, exciting rides. Tris was the best.  Brains, courage, and intuition all in one.  Awesome book!

B0083SBJXS|5|Fantastic movie
B0072OFM28|5|because i love  ALL EPISODES OF EACH SEASON, I MISSED THESE BECAUSE I WAS BUSY MOVING AND HAD NO TV AVAILABLE
0804136637|5|This book about Kim Philby who was possibly the most damaging cold war spy ever for the Soviet Union is fascinating and compelling.  The access he had through friendships (thus the title) and through his high-level position in MI6 is astounding and makes his betrayal the terrifically damaging case it was.  I found the man fascinating and appalling at the same time.  I can't imagine what he was doing and that he really believed in it.  Possibly it was being a spy that drove him more than communist ideology.  Whatever the case this is a terrific book and highly recommended.  Very well written.  Keeps you interested to the very end.
B00A2H9LK6|5|THIS NEW SILENT HILL IS MY FIRST BLU-RAY DISC I'VE BOUGHT<br />AND I CANT GET OVER THE PICTURE QUALITY IT HAS.<br />\MR. TULLO
B00B3HJMLM|5|I've been going to PCB for the past 15 years and this explains every amazing moment I've had done there on the strip. Which is the road on the beach. Him being a northern Georgia boy explains why he used to go there for spring break.  This is probably the best album because it hits right home with my favorite place in the world! He plays the 18th at Spinnakers Beach Club. Man wish I would have known who you were at the time back a few years ago I probably seen you there. People who can't relate to this cd. It's about the amazing unforgettable times you have with your buddies in PCB. Will be blaring this down the strip! Thanks LUKE. Songs are similar to tailgates and tanlines.
B005XBA9Y8|5|This Mercury box set has much more interesting selections of the repertoire than the Decca and DG box sets IMHO.  Don't fret over the missing original liner notes.  Heck, I never read them anyway.  It's missing the Howard Hansen Nordic and Romantic Symphonies Cd and the Chabrier Cd unfortunately.  Still, an incredible bargain for fantastic sound, cool cover art and record history.<br /><br />Updated 7/7/12<br /><br />After reviewing the content of the Decca Box set, I have to revise my review and assert that the content of the Decca set is really a lot better and more interesting.  I got carried away in this review with all the American content included, especially with Independence Day.  Both are great deals.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Inspiring story with wonderful character development.
B000YXMMAE|5|Perhaps this album is not the monumental statement that was OK Computer, but it is a collection of songs that definitely rewards repeated listens.  The songs seem simply constructed, but there is a complexity that unravels over time.    The sound effects and lush soundscapes are still there, but they are not the focus.  Instead they provide the background for a band that seems more willing to get a little personal with the listener.  \\"You're All I Need\\" features Thom admiring a woman, even though from a distance.  \\"House Of Cards\\"  is about an affair with a married woman.  Quite a switch from the paranoid voice we are used to.  You can hear a little of the anger we know Thom can generate in track 2, \\"Bodysnatchers\\", which also features a pulsing beat with grinding guitar chords.  There are a lot of hard rock bands that are glad Radiohead doesnt do more songs like this, because this is a song that really exposes how weak many rock bands are.    Some have commented that the track, \\"Reckoner\\", is a bit on the dull side, but I happen to really admire this one.  It has a lamenting melody that really seems to stick in my head.  I havent really had a chance to really take apart the lyrics to this song yet, so Im not really sure what I am supposed to take from it.  It sounds like in the chorus (if you can call it a chorus) he is singing \\"Dedicated to all human beings, because we seperate, like ripples on a blank shore.\\" So perhaps this is a lament on our chosen loneliness.  Im not postive, but I love the song.    The final track \\"Videotape\\" is well known by fans and sounds like it could have been on Thom's solo effort.  It has quirky percussion effects over a piano and is a haunting close to a fine album.  The lyrics seem to question what exactly our lives are going to be remembered for.  Classic weird, but ingenious, Radiohead.
B000002MG1|5|Automatic For The People is a bittersweet record that will never leave your CD collection once it's yours. A sweetly beautiful collection of songs about life, death and perhaps even beyond, I can't recommend this album  enough. It's one of the few CD's I own that can take me to the point of  tears (but not quite).<br />The songs on this record are not as cynical or  politically-inspired as previous R.E.M. releases. The group have changed  hats adeptly here and have gone for strings and melodies to accompany the  melancholic lyrics.<br />I forewarn you: this is an album no written review  can do justice. The best review you'll ever stumble upon is the actual CD.  It speaks for itself quite well.<br />Simply beautiful.
B000QCS8TW|5|I just had to read the books to compare to the series. The series is great and the first book was even better.

B00CWY76CC|5|fun and increasingly difficult. more levels please. love these games on the web and just as fun on the kindle fire
B00005V3Z4|4|One of the coolest films ever made, DOnnie Darko is different fro manything else I've seen. The story is confusing and comples  and requires repeat viewings a visit to the website and the commentary track to understand. To some that may seem like overkill, \\"shouldn't the movie explain itself?\\". But personally I love the way it works out. You have to really explore and think about this film before you truly understand what has happeend by the time it ends. Visually the film is stunning. Filmed with very subtle camera moves and bright, yet wet looking colors it creates a perfect atmosphere. Everything looks normal, but it carries a slightly eerie feel to it. As far as acting goes, Gyllenhaal is fantastic as the lead. He shows little emotion when normal, however when he goes into his trances he gets this strange glazed look on his face. Great acting. The rest of the cast is very good as well, although I'll never be a big fan of Drew Barrymore. The movie seems very real. The family acts lie kany normal family would. It doesn't feel forced or faked. The teenagers seem like ttenagers, they arent exaggerations of teenage stereotypes. The film is very reminiscent of the real world. Overall this is a very intellectual film. THer is no straightout comedy or action, but the film is funny at times and is often exciting. It would be very hard to find a catagory to fit Donnie darko. Many people will find it confusing and dull, many others will think that it tries to hard to be an intellectual film. However if you enjoy having to think about your movies, or jsut strange movies in general, Donnie Darko is a great pick. Probobly not the best choice for the casual FilmGoer who is just in it for a good time. This movie has a very independent film feel to it, without getting too pretentuous or bogged down in drawn out dialogue. Darko is excellence in cinema.
B00DHQHAH0|5|Love this show!
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great intriguing book.
B008518MOW|5|I loved all three movies in the series each movie is fresh with a different twist .  I just hope MIB -4 is in the future.
B004JN1CW4|3|It's alright, but is a little slow going- not as bad as the Scorch Trials though
B00461BQC0|5|High marks to Kings of Leon for this release of epic, catchy, and enjoyable rocked out tracks. My favorites are Mary, Back Down South, and Pickup Truck.
B00003CXA6|5|I'm going to be visiting Gettysburg in a couple of weeks, so I decided to buy the DVD to show my family. I've seen it before, but I enjoyed it just as much and more the second time through. I believe this will help me in my preparation to visit these hallowed grounds. Well worth another look if you haven't seen it since it first came out.
B00AYB1RGG|5|Dredd is a well done action movie and is often compared to The Raid: Redemption.  I do agree there are similarities, maybe even the same story, but Karl Urban does a great job humanizing Judge Dredd despite him having to wear the uniform and helmet throughout the film.  If you take the dystopian darkness of The Road Warrior, the over the top action of The Expendables (R rated version) and the dark humor of Robocop you'll get an idea of what this movie is about.  Granted they need more Robocop humor in Dredd 2.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this no holds bar take on an action movie.<br /><br />Fair Warning: There is plenty of slow-motion graphic violence and general disregard for human life.
6305897786|1|Ah, the beauty of a well-formed thought!  For I, my friends, a gate do open, and beyond lies the grassy knoll of Our Souls.  Nothing can compare to the wonderful nature of pureness, for even the wretched cannot abide something pure.  To see this movie is to wake up to the fresh scent of newly ground coffee, only to find out that your cat has chewed every last bite.  To hear the lovely soundtrack is to experience a thousand angels shouting in your ears all in one harmonious bleat, like the goat you owned in your youth which used to sit on a barstool and play harmonica while you danced with youthful abandon.  May you see and experience only the finest in homespun quilted lovelies.
B003O86FMW|5|This book will pull you in and keep you waiting for more, and just when you figured everything out wham curveball. A very good book that will definitely make you want to read the third I finished the first book this month then had to read the second so I borrowed it from my sisters library of books and now am waiting to buy the third on payday. This is one trilogy well worth the wait.
B0016YBFZ8|5|Great movie
B003Y5H57E|5|My husband and I have loved this film since we saw it in theatres. Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, and Steve Carrell, along with a host of other talented cast make this an instant classic. I am so glad I now know what the &#34;A&#34; stands for in the Scarlet Letter haha!
0887307280|3|Excellent advice for people starting and running small businesses
0385504225|3|Dan Brown's latest \\"masterpiece\\" started out so well. The first 80% of the book was standard Dan Brown fare: mysteries wrapped in enigmas hidden inside secret panels, and all with esoteric meaning, known not to we the readers, but only to the ancients and to Robert Langdon.<br /><br />I thought the book had a great bad guy, and lots of surprising twists and turns, and one very important twist that blew me away -- that I never saw coming.<br /><br />So, I suggest that IF you buy the book, you stop reading about page 500 in this 530 page book. (The page numbers are total guesses, since I read the Kindle edition which has no page numbers). But somewhere around page 490-510 things start turning positive in the cat and mouse game. I give the book a 4-star rating to this point, and Brown should have taken another 10 pages to put a finish to the action and the book.<br /><br />Sadly, shortly thereafter, everybody who is a hero (or heroine) figure starts preaching new-age, noetic science, the-bible-is-code, drivel to each other and to the reader for 20-40 pages, although it seemed more like 100 pages.<br /><br />However, this section reads very fast, because you can read 3-4 pages of drivel-speak in about 5 seconds as you search for more action scenes. Sadly, there are none.<br /><br />So, this last section rates a one or two stars, overall worth a weak 3-star rating.<br /><br />Don't say I didn't warn you.
B004EPZ03O|5|As a child of the Muppets generation, I was quite pleased with the latest movie. It's not as good as Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island or the original Muppet Movie, but it is still very, very good.  The Muppets dealing with their place in the modern world was fun to watch, thought I did on multiple times argue back that they never left.<br /><br />More Pepe for the next movie!  Best Muppet in the last 15 years.<br /><br />Amy Adams was revelation.  She was wonderful in this movie.<br /><br />Some of the other original songs didn't work as well for me, but The Rainbow Connection brought it home.<br /><br />Uncle Deadly - he scared the you know what out of me as a kid in The Phantom of the Muppet Theater, but he's wonderful in this one.<br /><br />Easy to recommend to any Muppet fan.
B00BVYNSLC|4|Science fiction that isn't overwhelming with suspended belief and techno-jargon isn't always easy to find. This series seems to capture it all. Part Sci-Fi, part thriller, part suspense with adequate supporting characters and an extraordinary performance(s) by Tatiana Maslany. Recommended.
6303402348|5|Forrest Gump, starring Academy Award Winner Tom Hanks (Cast Away), Academy Award Nominee Gary Sinise (Mission to Mars), Golden Globe Nominee Robin Wright (at this time Robin Wright Penn, Unbreakable), and Acadmey Award Winner Sally Field and directed by Academy Award Winner Robert Zemeckis, is and will probably be the greatest drama that ever existed.  It is a magnificent movie with an all-star cast and a wonderful sceenplay based on the novel by Winston Groom.  Winston Groom truly created a phenomenon when he created the character Forrest Gump, a mentally retarded man, who tries to live a normal life.  As Forrest tells his life story to several people at his bus stop, he shows us that he's not at all different than any other person and that he has accomplished more than others despite his problem.  Thrown in his story is his childhood friend Jenny(Robin Wright Penn) who becomes a drug-addicted prostitute , Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) a lieutenant in the Vietnam War in which Gump served in, and his caring mother (Sally Field).  Forrest Gump is truly a classic and will always be remembered.  Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks won Oscars for this while Sinise was nominated for one and Robin Wright Penn was nominated for a Golden Globe.  Forrest Gump is a must have for everyone.<br />Extra:  Haley Joel Osment makes a couple small cameos as Forrest's son.<br />Time:  141 minutes<BR>Rated PG-13 for mild language and some scenes of nudity
1439170916|5|An amazingly consise study of causes, treatments and cures of cancer.
B00C7KYXHW|5|They got it right!  A credit to the job they did with the movie series.  Great job by lawerence fishburne.
B0095ZQ36G|5|This book will bring the history of the air war in Africa and Europe alive for you. Especially, it will give the reader a greater understanding for the German pilots who fought against the overpowering might of the US Army Aiirforce, which was backed by the industrial might of the US. This story is almost unbelievable, but it is a true story based on interviews with the surviving men involve in the events. It is a must read for anyone interested in the WWII air war over Europe.
B00BN4JQ6G|5|I'd give their first 2 discs a 5-star, the next one dips to a 2-star, then back up to another big 5-star and the last disc is a solid 4 star. Overall a ton of great tunes for the price.
B005GFPZYK|4|Good true story about Chris Kyle. Gives you a real feel for what the training and fighting was like. Kyle comes across as a real person-a regular guy. The fact that he died trying to help a fellow veteran gives the story a sad conclusion.
B007SRZULW|5|This Cambridge Edition version of P&P is easy to read. While I really enjoyed the BBC TV series on DVD better than the book, it still held my interest in the story as originally told. Only downside was the DailyDeal seller who sold it to me-took weeks and weeks on end to get it.
B008Y2FRFO|4|Needs to give you more coins to start
B00CHSPB8Y|5|I think iron man 3 is the best game I ever played you just have to try it asap you will be addicted right away
B00000JCB2|5|Now I know that this album may not be as raw or as heavy as their first album, but this one packs a punch. The songs are actually better on this album. Better lyrics,better guitar work,and better overall everything  pushes this album up above their eponymous debut. This one has more melody  and actually some meaningful lyrics. Fred Durst can make you feel his pain  in songs such as &quot;Nookie&quot; and &quot;Rearranged&quot;. These songs  also have lyrics about Fred's past breakups with girlfriends and other  probs that teens may face. The lyrics on this album can be related to early  Offspring lyrics, although not as blunt and not as good. But this album is  definitely worth a listen, it has a large number of good songs.
B005ZOBNOI|4|I was surprised and delighted by this book, particularly the irreverent humor. It tells the story of a world that I'm not familiar with, one filled with people who have cancer or are trying to support people who have it. It felt refreshingly honest, I say it felt that way because I have no context for what it would be like to have a terminal illness.<br /><br />I enjoyed the fairly literary nature of the book, lots of philosophy and delightful phrasing. It's not a happy book, but it its definitely worth reading.
B003R4ZMNQ|5|Got it at a good price.
B00IK590UI|4|I liked it
B007SYWFRM|5|Perfect game for young and old people. Truly an enjoyable game
B001BGTWXI|5|This album is amazing!! Some of the songs sound like Stone Sour but that does not bother me they are still excellent.  I love Slipknot because they can take simple riffs and make them very catchy and amazing. They added guitar solos for songs on this album which will make many people happy.  I'm now going to rate the tracks in order from best to worst(excluding the intro). (they're all good though)<br /><br />1. All Hope Is Gone 10/10 - Amazing song the lyrics are decent but the guitar playing is better than any other band of the genre (Alternative Metal) that i could think of except for SOAD and In Flames (New In Flames).<br />2. Psychosocial 10/10 - I love the guitar solo in this song and they combine melodic singing and aggressive screaming which is Slipknot at their best to me<br />3. Gematria (The Killing Name) 9.5/10<br />4. Wherein The Lies Continue 9.5/10<br />5. Dead Memories 9.5/10<br />6. Snuff 9/10<br />7. Gehenna 9/10<br />8. Sulfur 9/10<br />9. This Cold Black 9/10<br />10. Vendetta 8.5/10<br />11. Child Of Burning Time 8.5/10<br />12. Butcher's Hook 8.5/10<br />13. Til' We Die 8.5/10
B008GWP2GG|5|Great acting.
B0002X314C|3|This cd is first off not a classic.  With the climate of black music leaning towards hip-hop more then soul this cd does give you a fix you have been looking for.  Pick it up mainly because who knows when you are going to get some decent r&b.  By r&b I mean true vocals and instruments and talent.  So buy it just for that.
B0063IH60K|5|i did not purchase this. it was soposed to be free?????<br /><br />but i do like it thank you  cyrus wilson
1250038820|5|Huge fan of HONY since it started. The book has an intelligent  selection of Stanton's photos and captions. And I love the format! I gave this book to my friends for Xmas and still keep buying copies for birthdays and even just because... It doesn't matter if you knew HONY before, if you love photography, NYC, or are simply interested in human nature, this book is a must.
B00DJUPLY8|4|works well
B00IAZCR1M|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this book...some of the background information was a little long, but very interesting<br />The story was inspiring !!!<br />It shows what can be accomplished !
B004PGO25O|5|this was a fantastic read. I really enjoyed and it was very easy to read.  only about 106 pages or so
B00AKEMHCA|5|This game is a must buy for td lovers. Now you might be thinking why get this when I can get it on the computer for free? Well I'm going to tell you why you should get it on hand held devices. 1. It has 2 special towers. 2. It is handheld and has co-op. And the main reason I got it is the beautiful graphics and I love this game. This is definitely a must have game.
B00H71PBQ8|5|More, more, more!  Anxious for Season 5!
B002VECM6S|5|My review is very late since I bought this ages ago.  But, if you have not seen this yet -where have you been?  Sandra Bullock who stars in it, asked three times to get out of the role because she did not feel her acting skills were good enough.  Well, she stuck with it and surprise, she walked off with the Academy Award.  This is a must see, but by now you probably have seen it on TV.  A very moving story about a disadvantaged black boy who overcomes hideous life challenges and is taken in by a rich family.  That's just the start.  You have to see it - my words are lame.
B000002KDI|1|I didn't receive my CD Live Rust, so I don't review it.
B00321LFZ8|4|the BBC version is much more soothing than the american version with sigourney weaver. david attenborough's voice is much more calming
B00C8S9W0G|5|As with all her books,  you just have to finish hers which brings to a halt, you can't start anything else.
B00FKF0F3C|5|It is a recounted of history with fictional people that let you understand who we are. We can learn from them
B00IXE7274|5|Great movie. Not historically accurate, but hey, who cares. Great scenes, good acting, and pretty good choreography.
B00004T8RK|3|I would say that Pearl Jam is the best &quot;mainstream&quot; band, and all of their records have been great until this one.  Now every hard-core Pearl Jam fan will love this just for who recorded it, but a lot of other people will most likely be dissapointed with this record.  Fist off, the first track is closer to a Who rip-off than a Who inspiration.  The rhythm riff is the same as The Who's &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot;, and the riff over top of it will make any Who fan remember &quot;Slip Kid.&quot;  There are some good songs here, but you should definitely check them out to decide if they are worth the price of the cd.  Compared to most of the crap on the radio nowadays, this is refreshing.  Compared to everything else Pearl Jam has done, this doesn't measure up.  At all.  A collection of their b-sides would be a better bet than this album.  To sum it up: unless you're a die-hard fan, or just want to say that you own all Pearl Jam's cd's, this one's probably not worth it.
B004HO6I4M|5|I bought this for my grand daughter to watch and I also love watching it with her it's so adorable and all the actors did a wonderful job.
B00HBQWGXK|5|Great book-love the Reacher novels- all of them!
B000MR9D5E|5|[[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series]]    I bought this DVD set for my husband for Christmas.  He loves the Discovery Channel and I thought he would enjoy this as well.  I have to admit, after watching some of the video with him I quickly got hooked and wanted to watch all of it.  This product is fantastic and also something that the entire family can watch together.  GREAT BUY!
B002CIMKHO|4|Solid thinking issues.......very worthwhile watching.
B00C74SHRK|1|struggled to finish - lost interest in plot -- very disappointing
B0083GQVOC|3|Tilda is great. She made it worth the slow-moving movie.
B00ESCJG1U|5|Okay, I have to be honest and say that I didn't really expect it to work as well as it did (if at all).  I was actually very pleasantly surprised and amazed at just how well it worked!!!<br /><br />I'm not very photogenic even with great cameras.  This is partly due to things like blotchy skin problems.  The &amp;#34;Beautify&amp;#34; feature on this actually made me feel good about myself again.  It truly didn't just apply a different kind of filter but actually analyzed the picture and did a great job with its default settings of which there are many you can tweak!
6302293553|5|You don't have to be a Monty Python fan to find this funny.  It is just so ridiculous that you find yourself laughing at the absurdity.  Good simple gags, and the concept of the horse/coconuts is more than enough to keep the  humour momentum going.  This is always great for an evening with a group of  friends with a similar sense of humour.  Great fun.
B00632HWOG|1|With my Kindle fire I can't get my Yahoo email any more. I got this hoping it would fix it.Am planning on getting another tablet that works and other than kindle. Kindle is becoming to have problems.
B00IS87HYI|5|Really enjoy being able to play this game on my Kindle.  It's really lots of fun and I enjoy helping and receiving help from friends.  Good level of challenge.
B00F8L2VO4|1|Have no idea what the app is like since it would not allow me access with my chosen email address!
B000EHSVSC|5|I'm not a fan of war movies (actually, I hate them), but this is a really great movie! Show's what happened at Pearl Harbor from both sides. Very moving. I think everyone should see this movie!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Loved it.  Kept me guessing.  Knew  minor character would have a major effect on the story but never guessed how.  Love Grisham.  Kept me absorbed.
6300216039|5|This was no typical love story, and a very good remake from the play. However, I was amazed at how many lines were cut out from the play and put into the movie. This was effective because the play may get boring for viewers sometimes because of all the un-necessary lines. The plot was very good, excellent in fact. Zefirelli did an outstanding job directing and the duel between Romeo and Tybalt was well choreographed. But... At the end I was kind of dissapointed because the movie had cut out a good part that the play had in it. I won't tell you the moment because it's a spoiler. Oh well... Enjoy the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4|It is a fun game and it is fast paced.Winning is easy,losing is not even close to being fun.I up for the win.
B001ANYDAO|3|It was recommended to me by a friend. It gives a interesting perspective into why some people are successful but is a real broad interpertation of successful people. Nice read though.
B00EHMFC78|5|Action pack.  I couldn't put the book down. With out giving anything away ,I felt like I was reading more than one book.  I loved it.
B00O0OR65E|5|This is a pretty awesome game!! Love to play it. Kinda reminds me of candy crush, but better. It's cute too.
B00A3NQNUU|5|Very cute game. Great graphics and easy game play. I like the idea of taking care of your own Dragon. My grandson is six and he really enjoys this game...it is teaching him responsibility. He checks on his dragons every day.
B0029XFNA8|5|Miracle on 34th St is a childhood classic and watching it on blu-ray makes it as good as ever. I'll be watching it with my grandchildren someday soon.
B00BAXFECK|2|Main Character has no redeeming qualities.
B0054JZC6E|2|it would be better if the games were all free and you didn't constintly have to go through the hastle of downloading games
B00FATEJYE|5|Great game. Wish purchases were lower.
B004VMUS9G|4|it gets me up smoothly when I go to school my real alarm clock sometimes doesn't go off so I am late but not anymore with this alarm
B00NY4UIKG|3|Good role for Denzel, but I wouldn't go 4 stars. I thought the storyline was weak.
B00EUS9JF0|2|I love mccartney but this cd falls short.  Doesn't matter, he's put so much great music in the past  I'll overlook this one.
B007FEFLTO|4|The second of this series was just as long, and, fortunately, just as interesting as the first. Covering the period of the early Thirties until just after World War II, it continues the stories of five or six different families of different nationalities, occasionally crossing paths with each other. Class struggle is still here, and the book confronts the reality of Cold War Soviet Communism with a vengeance. The new characters (descendants of the original characters in Fall of Giants) are all well-drawn. Some of the main characters are killed off, which is pretty shocking when the author has taken pains to introduce them so thoroughly to us. From the rise of Nazi Germany, to the Blitz, to Pearl Harbor, to the Bomb, this book makes history delightful, even if its premise is very sobering. On to Edge of Eternity!
0062376330|5|It was a gift for my Father.  He loved it.
B00FBR8130|5|Love it
B004FRX0MY|5|It's great to have!
B00O3UBB1U|5|Love this album!
B006LSZECO|5|Better than the movie. The twists were better developed. This is what a good book can do to ones imagination!
B00HGJ18C2|4|I downloaded for a trip I am taking.  I Like other games better but someone may want to play. Its free!!!
B00AEUPSEE|5|Moody, beautiful, insightful, captivating.  I can watch this over and over again.  Tilda Swinton is  perfection.  Sally Potter did Virginia Wolfe justice.
0316017930|5|Very good read
B00785P2QC|4|Good game. Different theme than most
B003HGKJH8|5|Melodic, original fuzz. You'll be bidding on that 1960s car you used to have. The bonus downloads that come with the disc are superb as well, abstract rehearsal videos and live tracks.
B0000024IE|5|This was thier follow up to the ground-braking 2nd album. \\"Welcome to the Terrordome\\" Ignited charges of anti-Semitism. \\"Fight The Power\\" is a Timeless Hip-Hop Song in which Public Enemy direct thier rage againt Popular artists. This is an Excellent album that all hip-hop fans should have.
B0000029LH|5|History is Michael Jackson and was one of his best collections in my opinion. I've listened to it since it was released, and listen to it still.
B00992CF6W|5|U have got to get this game, it is the #1 best game on the app store and game store, or any store for that matter
B00008FJWU|4|The album was as described. I am very happy with it
B007J4T2G8|5|The book has a cheesy romance line.  The book is incredibly easy, a child could read it (BUT I DO NOT SUGGEST IT). Plus the book was $5 instead of $15 for the hardcover so it was pretty cheap.  I enjoy the book, it's my go to when I just need a destresser.
B00QW8TYWO|5|It is a awesome game<br />I love it it is a grat<br />LOVE IT IT'S GRAT
B00079FUI6|2|The disks were scratched and they skipped
B009CCBCU4|3|Pretty good read. Started out kind of slow. Lots of fighting, fear, blaming themselves and others. Finally learning to grow.
B007HACDLK|5|I've enjoyed every Mitch Rapp novel since the beginning and this one doesn't disappoint, as always the next is always better than the previous one.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is soooo bomb!
B008673ZAQ|4|This was a good quick read. Looking forward to reading the next book in this series. Hoping it's good too
B001U0HBQ0|5|Had to buy this and when got my new Blu Ray player, figured I'd get it in Blu Ray. Great movie. On my list of all time favorite long/epic movies like Forrest Gump. It was also cheap here at Amazon.
0345803485|5|I had heard how good this book was, but I have to say it was much better than I expected. I finished it in about 3 days and it would have been sooner if I didn't have to work and sleep. Excellent book and I am definitely going to read the others.
6305546789|5|I Remember I Was 14. And Remembered Seeing The Commercials For It All Week Long, Before The Viewing Expereince That Would FOREVER Change My Take On The Modern Horror Film.

B00AREIAI8|5|I LOVE this app its so cool to have like your own virtual pet. It taught my cousin who's 5 responsibility and how to care for a pet. Now he has a loving dog that he takes very good care of because of this game.
B005HEVBGG|5|So much fun.  Really creatuve
B00DA6YEKS|3|Like the first volume it is overlong, unnecessarily convoluted, and sometimes derivative. But it is OK fun. Like the first volume this one had too much religious gobbledygook nonsense, probably a byproduct of the author's spending too much time in his Mormon missionary training sessions: There are Heralds, and Knights Radiant, and Almighties who may be dead or on vacation, Voidbringers (really!) and so on and on. Just skim through the incredible nonsense. Like 95% of American fantasy writing it is a byproduct of nerdy boys brought up on a spiritually  impoverished and ideological vision of world as 'light versus dark'. Then there is the fighting scenes that are basically renditions of Kung Fu movies, and not the good ones with actual skills, but the awful ones with wire assisted leaps. The bad guy here basically is supposed to look like Jet Li. There is little tension in many fight scenes because either people are invincible with their impenetrable armors and 5m long magic swords, or they fly through the air.<br />What IS likeable is the story of slaves, or Bridgemen. This was more pronounced in the first volume, but residues remain in this novel. The physical landscape is also pretty gripping, until you realize they are lifted from Peter Jackson's scenes set  in chasms in King Kong.  If you haven't read GRR Martin, Rothfus, Ursula LeGuin, or Anthony Ryan do yourself a favor and skip these. But if like me you just wanted cheap diversion then I have read worse. Borrow from your local library. Help encourage publishers to up their standards
B00C7DGRL4|4|I enjoyed the wicked spin on the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale. There was a good plot and the witches costumes were fabulous. Some humorous lines kept it entertaining as well!

B009ZQC7MY|5|Looking forward to season 4. cannot believe the finale.  looking forward to shirley mmclaine's return.  and i've read about the new cast members. exciting.
B00005OM4N|4|The title of that song says it all.  Brit is at that in between stage as a entertainer and as a person.  I find the lyriucs more person in such songs as that and Overprotected which I like the sond and the lyrics.  I  of course love I'm a Slave for it's sexy urban dance beat and Boys is a totally flirty club song.  I played it for friends of mine I know don't even like her as an artist and they loved that song.  It is worth the buy and a must have for the Britany fan!
0385738781|5|Thanks.

B00EJX2YGM|5|This set is wonderful since it has the online copy as well as the discs! The bonus content is also great!
B0046B8GEQ|5|I thought this was a great movie for kids AND adults. Thoroughly enjoyed watching it with my grandchildren. I am seriously going to get Despicable Me 2. Very well done, funny, and with a nice solid moral.
B00FN811SY|5|I have been, trying, to wait patiently for this to become available on the kindle fire devices and it is finally here!!!! I know other reviews say that you have to install the KIT first and all sorts of other things to be able to access the other bibles, however I just downloaded the file without doing anything and everything works perfectly.<br />I am so excited and cannot wait to use this is my ministry. Praise Jah for all that he does for his people!!!!
B007R4WENS|5|This app is amazing and extremely useful. I've never rated an app before and wasn't eve currently in the market for a chord progression and scales helper.  This was intriguing enough when I read about it a and boy am I glad I purchased it. No more wondering whether I got the progression right.  It is before me in the swipe of my finger!  Bravo!
B0088T3B0G|5|One of my favorite movies well worth seeing again.  An incredible cast !
B00C1CO0XS|5|George Benson is someone I've always loved and he didn't disappoint me. Of course I have all the tracks sung by Nat, himself, dear George stays true to the spirit of Nat King Cole but sings it like only George Benson can. Love it.
B00BHU9CCO|5|Great movie for kids and adults! It changes the whole idea that monsters have to be scary into monsters can be funny and lovable.
B0013UIUBC|5|Love it! Can watch it over and over again. Zeta-jones is brilliant and funny in the movie. You should see it!

B00N1HONIO|5|I absolutely love FNaF. Before I even played it I fell in love with the theory and everything. I am on night three and keep on trying to summon golden Freddy. GOOD JOB SCOTT YOU ARE A MASTERMIND!!!!!
B006VRDZ44|5|A gorgeous show about a fascinating era. Steve Buscemi is perfect. His character is such an interesting one, and he portrays the complexities so well. The supporting cast is excellent, but Buscemi is the star. If the description of the show interests you, it is a safe bet that you will enjoy it.
B006LSZECO|4|I may be in the minority but the ending of the story drug out too long.  Good but not fantastic.
B006LSZECO|5|I could not put this one down.  This is the kind of book you want to talk about with friends when you are done.  Masterful character development.
B009NQKPUW|5|LOVE THIS MOVIE. IF YOU ARE AN ALIENS FAN [THE RIPLEY SAGA] YOU WILL FIND THE BEGINNING OF ALIENS HERE.
B000084T18|4|If you were to ask for my opinion on this album,I would have to say that not only the hip-hop world wasn't ready for 50 cent,but it goes for the entire world.He's changes the rap game.He tells it for what it's worth which is &quot;THE TRUTH&quot;.The content of is lauguage &amp; choice of words tell us that he's versitile &amp; can do it any way possible.I beleive he'll never have another album like the 1st,not because of talent,but this album is a master piece itself with associates such as Eminem &amp; Dr.Dre &amp; the entire Shady/Aftermath camp.The streets are behind you &amp; want  you to continously stay # 1 on the charts.There isn't anybody left in the game that can match up to you,so good for it all 50 cent,you have the world in the palm of your hand.NEXT TIME YOU'RE ON BET,GIVE ME A SHOUT OUT OR LET ME BE IN A VIDEO.GOD BLESS &amp; MUCH SUCCESS.
B008133MDK|5|Very fun. Very smart. A wonderful reboot of this classic tale, modernized, cast, directed, shot, written, edited and performed brilliantly.
B0026RHR6K|5|Wonderful series, wonderful commentary.  Worth watching numerous times.  Everytime you'll see something you missed.
B00BBF3BO0|1|I use it both on my laptop and phone but trying to use it on my Kindle is another story. I can't even log in without it crashing every time. Please fix it.
B00HTYTQ5A|5|Five stars–the characters are fully fleshed out and Sherlock never fails to surprise and amaze. And Waston is perfect! The one MAJOR flaw is that production takes time - series 4 cannot come soon enough!
B007VUA7VO|5|An awesome app, no download issues, runs well. Very accurate app to manage the batt life of my kindle I highly recommend this app
B007QA3AH2|5|Great movie.  Really nails the star trek plot line.

B00192KCQ0|5|Whether you like old school or the radio friendly versions of Metallica, it was all **their** music. I won't over-analyze song by song; I'll just say this CD is a good mix of their musical tastes throughout. It has catchy melodies, and plenty of power metal. If they just needed money, a $100 a seat tour would have done it. Death Magnetic is instead a good expression of where they're at and what their (years deep)roots are. The songs have good leads and are way too long to be purely radio friendly. And if they (or the record co...) do shorten songs like The Day That Never Comes to be more radio friendly(ok, an overused term like \\"change\\" or \\"maverick\\"), all the more reason to buy the CD and hear the whole thing the way Metallica fans will appreciate.
0780624890|5|I really liked this DVD.  Lots more extras than expected that I found interesting.  The technical and creative process always interests me and this disk covers both well.
B00CF34B2I|5|I am fairly new To the Magic community, only playing a few months or so before now. And this was a great way to play. I am a fan of 2013 on my PS3 and this is no exception to my new found love of MTG. It actually fueled it I now have several real card decks and play often, I recommend this to all beginners.
0938045768|4|Australians will find this book a bit over-hyped but definitely worth close study. Building and stretching muscle, tendons and connective tissue at the same rate results in real practical strength without soreness. The exercises easily fit into a busy schedule and require minimal equipment. It will take patience and sticking to perfect exercise form. The progressive calisthenics approach will help older folks to build their lean muscle mass without injury which helps to maintain a good quality of life. Highly recommended.

B00992CF6W|5|If you don't have this game you really need to get it. It is the best game ever! I love the game because you can save your world. I have made 10 world's. You can name your world and it is so much fun. There is a bunch more bricks and you can get armor!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love this app on my Kindle. I play it nearly every day on my computer but now I can take it with me!
B005PK57NU|5|Every evening, I really look forward to the next episodes of The Good Wife.  I'll sure be sorry when the series is over!  The characters are believable, the story is gripping and the actualities are very true to life.  Additional items are that there is extremely little violence, just enough sex to keep things believable and interesting....so it's among my favorites.
0307010856|5|Great Book
B002SJIO5E|1|For sixty years I have been an avid SiFi fan, never seen a film I didn't like.  This could have been good, but the filming must have been done by a 3 year old with a cell phone. My wife and I watched it in a theater and the picture jumped around (shook) so much we couldn't watch most of it.    The movie industries and camera companies have spent millions to control camera shake. The effect in this movie is as if someone hand held the camera with maximum zoom. Even shots of people standing still and talking were jumping all over the screen.
B000002J1U|3|Generally considered the band's first 'soft' step, LED ZEPPELIN III is, in fact, a pretty 'hard' LP.  &quot;Immigrant Song,&quot; &quot;Celebration Day,&quot; &quot;Since I've Been Loving You,&quot; and &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot; are pretty heavy stuff--not exactly Fairport Convention.<br />But Page was beginning to give Plant, he of the golden locks and hippy-dippy love songs, a bigger voice on Zeppelin records.  The results were some of Led Zeppelin's finest moments: records with hard edges, soft mushy centers, and that big whompin' John Bonham core.<br />And, if all else failed, Page would lay down another stunning guitar solo, as he does on &quot;Tangerine,&quot; a premonition of the sound the band would perfect on it's masterpiece, PHYSICAL GRAFFITI, a few years later.<br />III is a transition piece, but a very good one, with several magical moments.
B0027MJU00|5|Gillian Flynn knows how to write broken people with flawed lives with the sort of raw, human honesty that few writers even approach
B0091REZMW|4|I love this game and it requires some good eyes to find the ever-moving objects in each room. Love it...very addicting!!
B0040I09RM|4|Good acting and interesting story.
B004XQO90E|5|Solid characters, believable story line. (I don't care if the science is 100% accurate or absolutely plausible) - this film rocks, what a great ride. (pun intended)  The actors did a great job - infusing heart and soul into a tense, tight, escapist, thriller. I don't buy many DVDs these days - there are so many other options. Bu when I do add to my \\"analog\\" collection, my main criteria is multiple viewings.   I watched this movie at least 3 times when it first came out. I am amped to see it again. Great job Duncan, Jake, Vera, etc!
B0015KO52S|5|Still in the cellophane. Perfect condition.
B00005MEW1|4|If Gothic you want, then Gothic this is-  a pleasant diversion from all the modern, glam, vampire poseur films. Filmed in 1922, Nosfartu is an historic, horror masterpiece. Without fast-action fight sequences, without high-tech special effects, without even dialogue (remember this was filmed in 1922) the film simply exudes gothic ambiance. The score from Cleopatra Records is the perfect audio backdrop to the visual stimulus; And, the music is continuous throughout the film (good thing, this is a silent movie otherwise). You may also want to buy &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola)&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; as they yield more storyline and provide a (fictional?) documentary prelude to Nosferatu. The three films together comprise an interesting trilogy (or shall we say, orgy) of vampire cinema. Having recently viewed these two other films made the viewing of this film far more meaningful.  This is no ordinary movie; don't expect to be entertained in an ordinary manner. Nosferatu is more 'feel' and 'attitude' than blatant bite-my-neck action. After several viewings you may find yourself listening to the soundtrack as primary entertainment, while the movie visuals provide secondary allure. On the complaint side- there were no printed materials included with the DVD-- no track listing, no historical by-lines. Nor does the DVD have any additional features. For these small omissions, &quot;Nosferatu&quot; falls slightly short of perfection, but rates a great 4 out of 5 stars.
0062290797|5|A celebration of the remarkable life and legacy of fallen american hero, Chris Kyle.  A must read to every American.  By now, almost everyone had seen the great movie.  What can I say?  See it, read it, and marvel.
B000HKW7E0|5|This is a classic !! I look forward to watching it every Christmas season and laughing all the way through !! I will never tie of this movie !!
B007FH9GA6|3|We've watched the Swedish productions of the entire triology. While Daniel Craig and Roony Mara provide commendable performances, we thought the Swedish productions were better and more accurately captured the original book by Steig Larsson. We thought the difference was the direction by David Fincher. We don't agree with Rotten Tomatoes (4 1/2 stars)
B00979CS50|4|Heard mixed reports about this album, but I have to concede that it grows on you. The long melodic guitar solos and pulsating drum beat is mesmerising. The lyrics are complex and open to varied interpretations. This may become a classic Young/Crazy Horse must have album as people spend the time to listen. At the moment this album is best savored late at night accompanied by a good bottle of red, Australian shiraz of course, and 70% Belgian chocolate.
B00DURGZHW|3|Good cast.  Watch if you like Matthew.
B000V6I7WG|5|Just watched this movie on DVD.. and wow! what a movie!! Having known not much about Korean cinema, I had no idea such a movie could come from Korea. This movie is a class apart. Yes it is shocking and disturbing, but you can't leave it for a moment and at the end it might well just leave you numb. There is a lot of action (and yes, blood too), but all that would be meaningless without the intriguing plot. What a story it is! A man is kidnapped and kept locked up in a room for 15 years, then released so he can find out the identity of his torturer and his motive. Despite of all the action in the movie, it is much more of a psychological story than an action movie. Excellent direction, script, acting and music. My highest recommendation. Don't miss it.
B00C1BV9Z6|5|Great stuff
B0094M2V7U|5|We need more Underworld
B00KBYLR02|5|great game. fun for all ages. sharpens the mind. entertaining.  keeps the kids busy especially on car or plane trips.
B00280LYIM|5|Ready for the fifth book this was great everyone should read it  it's AWESOME please<br />Read it you will love it
B001H5X7JS|3|My roommate loves this movie, it's just not my type of humor. The extras, except for the deleted scenes, are mostly boring as hell.
B006LSZECO|4|Great book, couldn't put it down. The ending was well thought out but I wished it differently.
B005JE7XW0|4|Was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Several good lines and classic jokes. Was impressed. Nothing over the top but a solid performance. Ending was a bit much but I enjoyed it.
B007SGM084|5|Great book
0780622553|5|If I had not seen tis film first I maight have like the Matrix a bit more but in my opinion the Matrix, while superior in effects can't hold a candle to this film! <br />Similar main plotline but much more facinating and darkly creepy. I loved this film from begining to end.
B0009XNUK0|5|I bought this CD for m 8 year old son and he cannot get enough. He has started the Michael Jackson rage going in the house all over again.  This CD is excellent for new fans old fans and even no fans.   When I saw the song selection I knew this was the ticket. The entire family is enjoying Michael Jackson.
B00HHE9H24|3|Other than the name bears little resemblance to the Movie.  Life magazine did feature this and the movie is about Life magazine so that was good. Takes about 5 minutes to read this short story.
B009UX2YAC|5|this game is way better than temple run I play this game all day everyday I cant put it down
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book was fantastic. John Green brilliantly narrated the story of two teenagers whose lives are far from average, without causing a wave of pity for the characters. Instead, his novel is inspiring, heartwarming, and hilariously witty. I would immediately suggest this book to anyone.
0517548232|5|This book was written several decades ago but the principles of economics still ring very true even in todays world!  Definite must read!
B00CJ4OMO0|5|A great movie.  Peter O'Toole is phenomenal, the cinematography is incredible, and the music is amazing.  The only negative is that the movie is incredibly long – it would be better if less time were spent slogging through sandstorms…  like David Lean's earlier work, Bridge on the River Kwai, the essence of this movie is the madness of war.
B005S9EKCW|5|One of my favorites on Broadway.  I bought the film version strictly for the music.  Turned out, the acting was great.
B000FC13E0|1|The book I got wasn't in English.  I'd love to get a copy that is in English so I can read it.
B0063IH60K|5|Great
B00957T6X6|5|Please finish this series before you die
B004ZMWUCU|5|What a great story, I loved the ending.  So sick of soppy love stories.  Very well written and the perfect amount of humor.
B00HXYKYIE|5|It was a wonderful, informative story and very intricately woven so as to keep the reader on his/her toes.
B000023VR6|5|This album is a modern classic! Dr. Dre's personal rapping skills are sometimes questionable and some songs may sound out-of-place, but &quot;2001&quot; comes from the most highly respected rap producer of our time and features a countless list of excellent rappers. The perfectionistic production of every beat on the album is another reason why it should not be missed. Again, you may well dislike a few tracks on this album, but you should not, you can not miss it. His last album was the Chronic, but he still 's got it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|2|It seems to be a lot of convecture on the author's part. All opinion with no real facts.  Not recommended.

B00IMYZL2S|5|Good.
B000SJJCX4|5|All ok...
B000002UA0|4|Syd Berret is completely overrated. He went insane even before the band created its signature albums like DSOTM, The Wall, and Wish you were Here. He may have turned the band in the psychadelic direction, but Waters was an infinitely better songwriter.  <br /> <br />Compare \\"Hey You\\" to \\"Bike\\", or \\"Time\\" with \\"Octopus\\" and its no contest, Waters beats Berret everytime.
B008KS4DR0|4|Definitely a fun movie. If you like &#34;The Cabin i the Woods&#34; you'll probably really enjoy this as well. :)
1878424319|4|I read the  book while traveling abroad and it helped me look at people with a more positive attitude.  The book makes you think about how you view yourself and others, along with very good ideas for how to improve your own self imaging.  On a regular basis I find myself relating daily occurances to the book and trying to use the information in order to be supportive and helpful to people who may be struggling in their day. The book encourages the reader to have a positive attitude for yourself, only you can treat yourself poorly, either by your mindset, or by allowing others to take advantage of you.  It does make you think, and encourages daily growth without guilt. If you have disruptive thoughts, analyze why, and try to correct it so the next opportunity is positive.   I enjoyed the different delivery from other books that strictly say &quot;have a positive attitude&quot;, but don't give any techniques for helping yourself and others.

B00F0O8SZK|5|Great as usual. Susan never disappoints. Love the funky duet with Elvis !

B00005JMJ4|4|This is a charming and subtle tale of a twenty something woman and a middle-aged film star who happen to cross paths while visiting Japan. John Harris (Bill Murray) has been given a lucrative sponsorship deal, promoting a Japanese whiskey, and is confronted by a few cultural barriers, mainly language, which he handles in obvious and hilarious ways. One of the funniest scenes in the picture is his two-minute stint on a cross trainer machine that runs out if his control. This is run of the mill slapstick humour at its best, pulled off in that familiar Murray style, which even now, when I think of it, brings tears to my eyes. In fact, this really is the only piece of slapstick in the entire film, because what makes this picture special is the subtle dialogue between the two main characters. There's no over acting in this film, but an understated realism and tasteful honesty, which to my mind, should bring a few industry awards to first time director, Sofia Coppola.<br />Bill Murrey has come a long way over the last twenty years or so. He is one of the world's most funny comedians, with his own unique signature, and has finally reached a point in his craft, where doing a `serious' role will not upset his many fans. He tried this early on in his career, playing the role of Larry, in the second film adaptation of Somerset Maugham's, `The Razors Edge'. Tyron Power played in the original and, of course, this was an impossible act to follow. We did not take him seriously back then, ironically, his performance was superb. In the role of John Harris, the character demanded a particular charm, sophistication and worldliness along with an attitude of self-deprecating humour, which Murrey captured brilliantly, revealing a man at the top of his form. Scarlett Johansson also commanded a fine performance as the lonely and abandoned, Charlotte - her close ups encapsulating every emotion and nuance in each and every scene. She managed to connect with Murrey and display a maturity of character that could not have been done any better. The camera simply fell in love with her face.<br />This is an enchanting piece of filmmaking about two normal people, lonely and in a strange country, who in any other circumstance, would more than likely not take a second glance at one another, but cross paths and discover and form a connection, and perhaps, something a lot more.  Four and a half stars.character that could not have been done any better.

B005DOKIYG|4|The sleeve was a great selection to choose and fits my needs perfectly.  It holds more than you think including a stylus I also purchased.  Color choices were also nice and gave variety to the product.  I recommend this product if you just want to keep your Kindle in a safe place that is easy to handle.

B001NLKZUA|4|I loved the action in this book, and there was never a dull moment. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Good for all those that love a good action some-what paranormal book.
B002NVELDQ|5|I loved it! Now I absolutely HAVE to watch the rest! I remember the clothes....my dad wore a suit like that....never had jean until the 70s! LOL!
B00GH75V1S|3|All in all it was a good movie, but they could have put more effort into the story and less into the gratuitous violence.  I was disappointed with the ending and the plot.
B00578FKVE|5|Although there are different characters playing the different actors , this series follows the storyline without missing a beat and adding in a few new characters that the movie didn't have time to add.
B0013527I4|5|wonderfully creative and fun. The big name guests obviously had a great time doing the show.
B007TBZ63Y|5|Love Percy Jackson- this is the best installment yet! The characters are maturing, Rick R has done it again, but for a slightly older crowd.<br /><br />Excellent!

B00127RAJY|5|I have been working out for years, from weights, to running, to structured classes at the gyms and began working out at home over a year ago, to save time and money.  These workouts are 20 minutes long, making it an easy commitment, and if you are honestly working as hard as Jillian is telling you to, and following a sensible calorie controlled diet, these workouts are effective. The three levels of workouts, and 3 2 1 sequence of strength, cardio and abs keep the workout interesting and makes the time fly, I'm done before I know it.  The moves are challenging but there are opportunities to do the modified versions of many of the moves, if a person would need to.
B0007O38F8|5|ok for one ... little bow wow is not better than 50 cent... wow... and for this album... i listened to it online.. its hot.. no not better then the first.. BUT if you like 50 you'll like this... no way that this album is garbage.. your crazy.. other then songs like so amazing feat. olivia.. this album is hot.. you can listen to it over and over and over.. obviously no one appreciates a good album... 50 did it again.. and i will buy EVERY shady aftermath g-unit album that comes out.. always have.. always will..

B000056VJ7|4|Meatloaf was best known for his role of Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show when he released Bat Out Of Hell in 1977.  The album exceeded all sales expectations by eventually selling over thirteen million copies and ranking among the twenty biggest selling albums of all time.  The album is a winning combination of theatrics and pop perfection.  Everything about Meatloaf is big, especially his voice and he has the chops to handle these epic tracks.  Writer Jim Steinman's seven compositions are a not veiled ode to teen lust and Meatloaf attacks them with the fervor of an overhyped teenager.  His vocal interplay with Ellen Foley on tracks like the classic high school rocker \\"Paradise By The Dashboard Light\\" have all the ... tension of a teenage date.  Todd Rundgren's production shows why he is on eof the best in the business.  The music soars and the remastering gives it a new clarity.  Bat Out Of Hell despite all its sales success never made the top ten as it peaked at number thirteen and it is far and away the biggest selling album never to reach that plateau.
B008GM1FPI|5|Well done combination of art and philosophy. It uses real people that are transformed into art characters and the dialogue is based on philosophical views. It keeps your attention throughout if you like philosophy.
B00I0WHVZW|4|I think this is an awesome game, for young and old. I think it 's a great way to learn about all the elements and what you can &#34;do&#34; to them to change them into another element. It's almost like detective work to get them all! My only qualm about it would be that it doesn't tell you any information about the element. It doesn't even tell you the name of the element! It will give you it's symbol but that's it. I know that I am an adult but I am still curious about what the full names of these elements are. I would need to have another device (other than my phone) to look up the names. That would drive me nuts.<br /><br />I would recommend this for any child. Spark their interest in science at an early stage cause science is awesome and it's proven to be true. Just make sure you have a book, tablet, computer, or rocket scientist around to answer the questions about the elements.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I'm not a huge television buff....but I kept seeing friends posting on FaceBook about this and hearing people talk about it, that I decided to give it a shot.  I would be embarrassed for you to know how many hours that I watched this, once I began.  I have seen all 3 seasons and just wonder how I'll make it till more are ready to watch.  Awesome.
B00E9ZATJO|5|IT WAS ENJOYED BY THE ENTIRE FAMILY AND WILL BE WATCHED AGAIN AND AGAIN. MAKES THE KIDS LAUGH OUT LOUD

B003UESJH4|5|I've always liked Colin Firth, ever since I saw him in Apartment Zero, but did get a bit impatient with him for making so many weird rom-coms. Now he's in fine form in the King's Speech where he plays stuttering regent Bertie, who eventually became George VI, which allows him to flex those acting chops and deliver an emotional role that covers events of great historical importance. The matter of speaking in a steady voice, taken for granted by so many of us, is given the full treatment here, as is his various family agonies, and the tumult of the times leading up to World War II. Of interest as well is that the film, despite being set in the 1930s, includes figures who are still a part of our modern lives, such as Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (also known as the Queen Mother, and played without her characteristic goofiness by a pleasantly restrained Helena Bonham Carter), and his daughter Elizabeth (also known as Queen Elizabeth II). Geoffrey Rush is, of course, Geoffrey Rush, and brilliant as Lionel Logue, an eccentric Australian speech therapist whose methods (nor even his very existence) are not at all trusted by the snooty upper crust that surround George VI; but he's a trooper and he carries on regardless, showing them their place as much as he possible can. The story of watching a stutterer overcome his handicap and give a speech that is important for the cause of freedom ultimately does make you want to jump up and cheer; the story of social inequality and intense family drama, along with national intrigue, is also there as a bonus if you want it.
B00DR0PDNE|2|I had to reset internet every use and reset the chrome cast every use.works but difficult to use.
B004RC8NXI|1|It is really sad when you get your expectations up with a new Ivan Reitman comedy only to be bitterly dissapointed by it. There is a hardly any chemistry between the two protaganists (Portman and Kutcher). All we get is a bawdy comedy with a slow moving story. Kevin Kline is simply wasted. Just oh dear, yawn.
B000FC130E|5|Another triumph by Neil Gaiman. This one is your typical adventure story of an unsuspecting subject getting pulled into a magical world. A lot of children's and teen fiction follow this formula, but Neil makes it work with adults splendidly. I have yet to find a book by him I haven't liked.
030758836X|4|Very fun book- great page-turner.  Loved following the characters even though I wasn't crazy about either of the main characters!  Many twists & turns.
0385504209|5|I enjoyed this Book, immensly. I believed it to be well written, and fast pace. It is a notch above regulat fiction because it has a point. The book was well researched. The plot involves and ancient old secret society: the priory of sion, the conservatice catholic opus dei, fighting over the greatest cover-up in the history of the world. The Holy Grail, is not as believed jesus cup. The author is a christian, and at Dan Brown's website a bibliography is included. As to wether or not the disciple at the left hand of Jesus, in the painting of the last supper, is clearly a woman. Anyone who claims other ways really should take a look at it. Please do not dismiss this as Anti-Christian, but accept it as enlightnening and if true, an intriguing theory.
B0063IH60K|4|love the game!  hate the annoying pop ups.  I already know I can get other games. don't need tobe reminded so often.
B000JSI7AI|5|I absolutely adore this movie.  It is one of my Top 10 Favorites!  I have literally watched it so many times I know almost all the lines..  I usually end up annoying the people I watch it with  lol.<br /><br />It's a wonderful romance story about 2 ordinary people who fall in love, who happen to be two men, and in the time period it was set it wasn't an ordinary situation to say the least.  So they had to keep it secret and live separate lives which put a huge strain on their relationship with each other.<br /><br />Deals with the one thing we all have in common ( no matter what sex, race or religion we are) and that is LOVE.  All of us can relate.  We have all felt the passion and the warmth of love, we've all felt the hurt and heartache love can bring us as well.<br /><br />This is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion.  Brilliant performances by Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal.  A must SEE and a must HAVE in your DVD collection.
B00LM9IBOU|3|Great reviews but Anomaly was much better.
B007YJS7G4|5|This movie was completely and totally riveting. I could not pull myself away from it for one minute.<br />The actors were superb, the directing marvelous, and the plot, and storyline, compelling, and remarkable.<br />I truly can not understand why it was not considered for an Oscar. That is just a real shame, however, this movie will<br />give generations to come, a real view of what really happened in our nations' history. Bravo!
B00AAQHP66|5|Another Great Movie  Watched It Twice  Just As Good The Second Time
0205313426|4|FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A VALUE PURCHASE, THE BOOK IS<br />QUITE STANDARD ADVICE, EASY TO ACCESS, USEFUL BUT LIMITED IN SCOPE.
B00GB5ND9S|5|My kids love it!
B00BLCHZC2|5|I wasn't sure with first few episodes,  but I stayed with it and I'm glad I did!  What a show!  The story, the action, the scenery,  the wardrobe, the hair and oh the shirtless men!  I really enjoy the story though, the interaction,  the twists and turns, watching relationships grow and change. They are family and you definitely see similarities,  in some ways they are no different than us. Oh and the shield maidens are kicka**! Definitely worth watching I'd your don't mind all of the above sprinkled with war, bloody war.
B008673ZAQ|5|I loved this book. Ms. Day didn't go on and on rehashing the history in Bared to you. It didn't have the BDSM I was expecting, but you saw it building. Maybe in the third book. The sex scenes were not typical which made them really intense, and exciting. The love between the two characters was touching and heart breaking. The fighting did get tedious, but understandable. It had a lot of twists and turns that kept the pace fast. I love the two characters. The ending was wonderful. I just hate I have to wait so long before the next book.
B007MDB71O|5|This was one of my favorite movies of the year.  This wasn't just some put together hackjob from Disney like they've been putting out recently (Pirates sequels ring a bell anyone). Anyway, don't listen to the critics, at least give the film a chance it deserves.
B00FWLDHSY|3|The action was a little cheesy, think of old Godzilla movies. But the Jaegers are awesome to watch. Idris Elba is always great to watch, very talented. It's a thumbs up for another good Guillermo Del Toro movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4|The book was a great final read. the final book was a good end to this triology . must read
B00AKKGX4W|5|I enjoyed this book as well as the book prior to it . It was short and still a good read. I will be reading the rest in the series .
1475143389|5|I prefer to think of things very scientifically and rely on facts and research in pretty much everything I do from fitness to buying a pair of shoes.  That is what you will find in this book by Mike Matthews.  Bigger, Leaner, Stronger has helped me immensely in achieving my physical goals and at the age of 33 I am in the best all around shape in my life.  I still have a long way to go but as Mike explains, results take time and patience.  Mike first goes through the proper diet plan for the goals you want to achieve.  If you want to cut some fat off he has a plan for that.  If you simply want to bulk he has a great plan for that as well and since purchasing his book, \\"The Shredded Chef,\\" it has helped me achieve my weight goals without sacrificing taste.  I can cook!  After working on your diet the fun comes with the workout plans.  They are precise, easy to follow, and take no more that 45 minutes to an hour to complete and with about 30 minutes of Cardio mixed in later in the day.  Finally Mike goes through his guide to supplements which are also vital to a good plan.  After following Mike's plan for 2 months now I have lost 13 pounds and am seeing huge gains in muscle definition already.  Follow Mike's plan and then his one-year challenge at the end of the book and you can't fail. Enjoy and thanks Mike!
B00JVZ0DQG|4|This is a fun app/game. It is like the Facebook game and you can connect with it and get rewards on both games. I have just started playing it but Im sure I will enjoy it.
0062378074|5|The single best survival book on the market. I am very pleased. A must-have!
B00E8KLWB4|5|I only got this game yesterday and am having lots of fun with it. I like the different types of puzzles, switching from hidden objects to putting together a torn &#34;picture&#34; plus other kinds of puzzles AND if you are patient you can play for hours and not spend anything. When I put the game away yesterday I was low on everything; energy, crystals, etc. but overnight everything was restored for free. When I get low I just switch to another game or even switch off till everything is restored. I am looking forward to hours more enjoyment from this game.
B00BDAP66E|5|Works really well for my Cigar Review page. Love it.
B00E8KLWB4|3|Fun game. A little slow moving and the quests are frustrating at times because you have to click on the quest, accept it then play them turn in what you find them collect. It would be nice if it were a bit more streamlined.
B00000DRA9|5|Mmmm, how I love this music... this movie was always one of my favorite movies as a kid, and listening to the music always takes me back to my childhood, to those happy times... anytime I'm feeling stressed, or down and out, I just need to put this on and it's all happy!! <br />But the cd transcends the movie in my opinion... yes the nostalgia factor is part of its appeal, but it also is full of real emotion... listen to the Happy Flight melody, and tell me you don't feel happy and upbeat while it's playing... the little Fantascia part is errie, while the Ivory Tower part as a cool little triumphant feel to it... and Theme of Sadness... oh my, it almost makes me cry everytime... kids music my ass, this is adult music, full of complicated emotions!<br />I don't know if I'll ever be confident in my self to put this on during a party or anything, but damn this cd is good... if I have to keep my love of this music secret so as to not be outcast by my friends, then so be it... but this music RULES!!! :)
0790729652|5|Keaton and Nicholson made this one a keeper. Michael Keaton<br /><br />was perhaps at his publicized peak as an actor. He delivered<br /><br />a good deal performance as Batman. Kim Basinger was<br /><br />also good as Vicki Vale. Jack Nicholson as only Jack can do<br /><br />was on fire and always knows how to be the in your face<br /><br />pyscho villian.<br /><br />Tim Burton's direction was right on, effective, mischevious<br /><br />and alert. Burton's magic touch at this point in his career<br /><br />was self evident, way before such flops such as Planet<br /><br />of the Apes.<br /><br />The action was well done with special effects, and you got<br /><br />to love the whole new darker and gruesome tone than the original<br /><br />Adam West serial.<br /><br />As Roger Ebert says, thumbs up.
B0018O4YSQ|5|These days, \\"sci-fi\\" usually means one of two things:    1) Big budget CGI fests that are 99% special effects and 1% plot, or  2) Preachy over-the-top \\"Disaster\\" movies that are 99% fiction and 1% science.    In contrast, `Dark City' is a rare beast; a genuine, intelligent, thought-provoking science fiction film.     It's best to go into this movie without knowing anything about the plot, since unravelling the story is a key element of the film. For this reason, you should get the Director's Cut instead of the original (see below).  Suffice to say that 'Dark City' takes a fairly well-worn opening (amnesiac wakes up in a strange room with a dead body) and expands it into something completely unexpected.  We quickly realise that the murder mystery and John Murdoch's attempts to unravel his past are only a small part of a much larger story. This is a complex and intelligent film, and requires some concentration to follow. I must mention a scene early on that seems like a jarring continuity error at first....this forms a major part of the plot revelation later in the film.      The cast do an excellent job; Rufus Sewell nails the confused but driven hero Murdoch, and William Hurt gives an under-stated, sympathetic performance as Bumstead. Jennifer Connelly as Anna and Richard O'Brien as the sinister Mr Hand are also good in their roles. But the real star is Kiefer Sutherland, who gives what should have been an Oscar-winning performance as the creepy, enigmatic Dr Schreber.  Filmed in Sydney, Australians will notice plenty of local actors in cameo roles (Colin Friels, Melissa George, Bruce Spence, Nicholas Bell, David Wenham...).    The production and direction are top-class as well. There is some use of CGI, but it's not overdone, and certainly doesn't take the place of plot and character development. There is effective use of subtle shading and artificial lighting by director Alex Proyas, since most of the action takes place in the dark. And the deliberately anachronistic setting is both film-noir and futuristic at the same time. The skyline of the city brings to mind `Metropolis', but many of the sets were later re-used for `The Matrix'.      It's best to get the Director's Cut over the original release now that it's available. There are several small scenes which help flesh out the story a bit, particularly involving Bumstead, but the main difference is the removal of the opening narration. Obviously the studio heads under-estimated the intelligence of sci-fi audiences, and forced Proyas to add a narration containing several spoilers to the theatrical release. The Director's Cut removes this...but if you do get the original release, you can just turn the volume down until Dr Schreber first appears. Trust me, this is one film you will enjoy working out for yourself instead of having it spoon-fed to you.    Really, this film just clicks. What could have been a very self-indulgent storyline is made tight and entertaining because the casting, production, script and direction work so well. If you expect a brainless popcorn \\"sci-fi\\" blockbuster then don't bother, but for those of us who were crying out for a return to \\"real\\" science fiction, `Dark City' is a masterpiece.
B000OIZUW6|4|Vintage Follet: fast-paced with a satisfying ending.
B008VVT51U|5|Funny and whimsical but a &#34;message&#34; underneath it all.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Excellent cast of course the scenery is gorgeous.
B00GY0HJ4K|4|I enjoy trying to figure out what I have to do to win the game.
B0089EHWQE|5|Even though I could see the ending coming, the characters were so interesting, so multi-dimensional, that I couldn't resist following them.  This is one to keep, reread, and treasure forever.
B00ABGEFWC|5|It's just a wonderful reading and story learning experiance for children all ages that are eager to learn kids stories.
B004LWZWGK|5|Batman sacrifices all to save his city and fight the dark forces of the League of Assassinations.  His last act of ultimate sacrifice gives Gotham a hero to look up to with his death.  At the end, when he is seen with a beautiful woman at a Paris restaurant you realize he fakes his death as he saved the city for nuclear devastation to give them an ideal to believe in.
B0063IH60K|5|This is a great fun game for all ages.  You can play Vegas or standard style.  Also, the background and the cards can be customized.  All around awesome free app.
B009UX2YAC|3|lets play a game loo this is a good fast pace game for all ages I like the levels and bonuses I'm addicted. And caint. Stop lol. Thanks for a good fun game
B0083SBMBM|2|Tedious, over done, to long and silly.<br />And I am a lover of SiFi. Aliens is still<br />my Number 1.
B007L3BMGA|5|because you could not put it down that to me is the sign of a good book very exciting read
B00005JMEW|5|This is my all time favorite movie (Next to Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Reservoir Dogs). Tarantino is the best director i've ever seen. This movie is so cool with its non-stop action and its sick style for killing. The story to the movie is easy to follow and the action is the coolest. Anyone who said that this movie bad won't know a good movie if it smacked them in the face. Tarantino's movies are the greatest and thats all I have to say until...Kill Bill Vol.2
B00QLVY7J2|4|It has been interesting from the beginning.  I am wondering what I'll find next.  Each new game I play has its own twist on what you can expect next.
B007ZGO7EM|4|Good app does what is suppose to do
B00BMVTS1S|5|Really well done.  This film sets things up very nicely for the next two films. The break point is well chosen.
B00280LYIM|4|I love this series of books!!! There is a lot of adventure. The one thing that I don't enjoy is that there is a lot of violence in this series. Every book something tragic happens and someone almost gets killed. I would not recommend this book to younger children.
0156030209|5|This is my favorite book of all time. Why? Because everyone who reads it will get something different from it. Just what is it about? Alot really depends on your own interpretation. To me, it is a commentary on belief systems and what you in your own mind want to believe, and how that affects what you do, etc.  This is a good book for young adults to read. I hope they don't make it into a movie, as I would not want to see a literal interpretation of this book (M. Night Shamalann (sp?)) has the movie rights.
B00BSBXZDY|4|Cute little light hearted movie with an interesting spin on the classic holiday fare.
B0064TVQ5E|5|This version of mahjong gives you multiple choices and they are all challenging.  It is a real challenge and very interesting.
B0064TVQ5E|4|This is fun to play especially when you want to just kill time.  I guess it keeps your brain working finding the correct matches.  I like the fact that it was free.  Anyone who enjoys Mahjong should like this game.
B0089K7DGW|5|HBO has done it again!  If you haven't seen this series...what are you waiting for?  Love the digital copies!  Very portable for traveling.
1476730628|5|Adam teaches in this book how to achieve your dreams by turning your struggles into your strengths. I love his enthusiasm and dedication towards making this world a better place for our children.
125000098X|3|I am so into this trilogy, but this one left me a little disappointed.  It didn't seem to have the pizzaz of the other two and I hated the way it ended.  Hopefully, the next one will revise my enthusiasm for this series.
B003O7I6L6|5|Sweet international trader highly recommended to all.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3|thought it to be one of the best game. Had played in my friends ipod and was eager to download the game. But the most disappointing things was that it did not provide me with great graphics. Liked the game but not its visual graphics.
B00F8L2VO4|5|Unbelievable tool for learning a new language and free. It is the way we learned our native voice.... see spot run.. run, spot run
B00HQIZBE4|5|I love this set! This was not my favorite modular before I bought it, but I bought it because it seemed to be the only modular set on Amazon where the price was not inflated. When it arrived, it broke my expectation. This is a truly unique modular building, it is extremely high detailed inside and out, and was very fun to put together! It is also an amazimg value with over 2400 pieces for only $160.
B001QOGYFO|5|I had not heard allot about this movie, but I am a big Kate Beckinsale fan so I bought the movie and I was not disapointed. It is a movie that will keep you in your seat. Its one of those movies you watch after dark when the wind is howling outside your window. If you like movies that have a strong woman lead, thriller, the who done it, you will enjoy this movie.
B004VMUS9G|5|I think it is a great alarm clock.not one glitch yet .I can use it perfectly yes. It's also free wow I love it.
B005LAIGZU|5|This Truly Is How OUR ARMED FORCES ARE TRAINED. WE DON'T BOTHER YOU. SO DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT<br />BOTHERING US, OR THE BULL WILL REAR IT'S HORNS AND YOU WILL GET THE POINT.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
B004XZR63M|5|Robert offers real and step by step advice for those who are willing to question and rethink what we have been taught about wealth and money. I gave this 5 stars because he not only talks about his life of financial discovery, but gives easy direction for any one willing to put the steps into action, not just read and forget about what Robert has so generously shared.
B0000AQS0F|5|I stumbled upon this series completely by mistake. What a shame it wasn't given a fair chance. This series is quality all of the way. Post apolyptic, great cast, music, scrips, direction, all superb! If this series had been given a fair chance, it would still be around. I am glad I own the whole thing as well as the movie \\"Serenity\\". A must see for all sci fi fans as well as folks that just want good viewing.
B00CSR2J9I|5|This is a fun game for any age.  Very easy to learn and play.  Yet it is challenging and the levels get progressively harder.
0316287059|4|i had purchased Making Faces before i got this book. Sadly it was stolen. I waited a few years before purchasing this book. I wish i would have done it sooner! This book is much better. I like how he goes into detail about the looks hes done. As much as i liked Making Faces it was more of a photography book rather than the insight into his artistic world and how he works his magic :) I highly recommend this book to any makeup beginner, or advanced cosmetic enthusiast.
B00L9B7IKE|4|I generally adore books of this nature. Conflict between husband and wife is a fun read for me.  We have drunken Rachel, whose self esteem is battered. Hard to route for her but it says something about the author to get the reader involved enough to be frustrated with a character. The book was an easy read and made me look forward to finishing it. Would not have guessed the ending and who had dealt the sad end to adulterer Megan. Nevertheless I felt dissatisfied with the ending and felt it should have had a somewhat stronger conclusion.
B00486UF52|5|Kate Fox puts English behaviors under a socialist's microscope, and comes up with funny and endearing rules about what it means to be English. A hilarious read, and a definite must of you are going to visit or stay in England.
0544002318|3|I realize that this book was written by a runner and not a writer, and that he did have help, but I found myself getting really bored towards the middle and I fell asleep at the end.  The title should not be &#34;Eat & Run&#34;, it should be &#34;The Life of Scott Jurek&#34;. This book is really a biography with some self loathing, a lot of soul searching, and some recipes at the end of each chapter that don't seem to really seem to work.  They seem to be out of place.<br /><br />There are a few pictures scattered here and there to give you some idea of the people he talks about, but they leave you wanting more pictures to get a better view and  understanding.<br /><br />I would give the book an overall &#34;C+&#34; rating.  If the ending was half as interesting as the beginning, I would give it a better rating.  As it stands, better luck on you next book Scott.  Good first try.
B001NHNG64|5|I have read about 9 Jack Reacher stories and they are all consistently good.The way Lee Child portrays Reacher is conducive to<br />the life style Reacher has developed. However I suggest reading them in order. I did not and have found it a little confusing as to how disconnected from the capitalistic world he is and when.
