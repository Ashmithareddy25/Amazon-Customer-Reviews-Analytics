B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Besides all the eye candy, the witty dialogue and constantly twisting plot lines never allow for dull moments.<br />I've loved this show since the beginning the second season was even better.
140006922X|5.0|I am simply speechless at all the negative reactions to this book. Yes, some of its conclusions and framing may call into question certain ideas that some Christian groups hold about Jesus and his life, but it's a respectful, well-sourced, and extremely well-written historical work. As a society, we can't even agree on what happened five minutes ago, let alone 2,000 years ago. Discord in academia is a crucial component of advancing our understanding and promoting critical thinking. Works that challenge the status quo, especially thoughtful and exhaustively cited works like this book, are vitally important. It is shameful that so much of our society now only seeks out knowledge and opinions that match their preconceived notions, but the trend explains the reaction to this book completely.<br /><br />It's clear that those rating this book one or two stars have simply not read it and are instead venting the frustrations and anger they feel after hearing someone else's flawed interpretation.<br /><br />At the very least, I'm glad that the insultingly poor way that Fox News and other conservative media have responded to this book has only worked to make it more visible, and introduced Mr. Aslan to a much larger audience.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|This is still one of the best movies of all time. Great family movie for all ages. We have seen it many times and the story never gets old.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.It makes you more attentive I guess?.You have to clean,watch your money,compete and keep your horse health and feeling loved.
B001NOOKH6|5.0|You will like it if you like Streisand.  The movie downloaded to easily to iphone.  The film quality was excellent!!
B003L77TZI|5.0|Love the album, great pop tunes, easy to listen to over and over. Fantastic pop music from a great artist.
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|A little dumb because when I pressed a bunny to make stairs it would go to another bunny and go the wrong way but don't get me wrong I love this game but the... I can't think of the word but still don't for get to get it, its SO addictive and so fun and those are the best mixtures  ever trust me ;)
B006TF6WAM|3.0|This is another book that examines how the past impacts on the present and the future.  It was a comfortable read and caused me to think back on my youth and consider how I could have managed it differently.
B0061S073A|5.0|Keeps my kids out of my apps and from getting into places/deleting things that I wouldn't want. Also saves me from having to put a password on my kindle which really is flawed since I've had it factory restarted a dozen or so times because they guessed the password wrong too much and it GIVES them the option to factory restart.<br /><br />Easy open and close. Hasn't crashed any games.<br /><br />Con to this app though is you can't raise or drop the volume without having to exit out of it but otherwise....<br /><br />I LOVE THIS APP!!!
B000FC13Y0|4.0|This fantastical story delivers a real message about love's ability to creep up on you, unexpected. it is a light read, with all the uniqueness and creativity that you expect from Neil Gaiman.
B00CWVBV4E|5.0|For those of us who grew up loving super heroes, this movie will still keep you entertained as your kid watch it.There was quite a bit of humor that kept me entertained as my children watched it. At just a little over an hour, it is a fun watch for the family!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This game is not free, but I got it on Amazon Deal of the day, so I did get it for free. I really like the game. Very addicting.
1451648537|4.0|I learned a lot more about a man I have long admired. He has helped change the world of computing and phones.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|My HP laser jet printer is wireless and about 2 1/2 years old, but this program doesn't work with it. You have to have an eprinter that can receive emails. That is what I found out online.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|See their videos.  I was sold by their rendition of &#34;Just Someone you Used to Know.&#34;  This is one of the few albums (yes, albums), I enjoyed completely.  Nice music for a drive in the country. (secondary roads only).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A great way to pass the time standing in line.  Quite fun and a great mental exercise for spatial relations training  :D
B00000IQV7|5.0|My daughter wants to be a physician, for all of the right reasons.  She loved this little known sleeper from the past!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I read this book in two days. I just couldn't put it down. Although, I could have enjoyed the book even more if there weren't so many intense love scenes.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I love how Ms Gregory is able to bring you right into the action as if watching a movie.  So far I have enjoyed every book of hers that  I have read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was just challenging enough to be fun and not frustrating. My daughter really enjoyed helping me,too. We can't wait for more levels.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I like this game because of the gliding competition with other racers. You can accelerate, glide thru tunnels, and free fall from high places.
B004NL1ELQ|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The book quality was fantastic, brand new and clean. I don't know what the other customers are complaining about with the pictures. Some of them are in colour and some of them are black and white, but none of it was cheaply done. Even though this is marketed as a children's book, I think everyone ought to read this. The English version is obviously easier to read, but this version is much more elegant and beautiful. The English version doesn't have the same magic that this one has.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Better than temple run, loads of fun and free. What more can you really ask for, seriously. It's loads of fun and once you get in the zone you're good to go.
B000U6BT40|5.0|This is a very interesting and entertaining show. I have started Season 2 and it remains a great show!  You will enjoy this.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|I love everything Joe puts out on CD.  This albumn was no exception.  &#34;A door into Summer&#34; is my absolute favorite
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game the kids love it. The way you pet the horse could be improved otherwise it would be perfect! Hoping for breeding to come soon.
0375869026|4.0|Found quickly.  For a new book required for summer reading - this was perfect price and quick delivery.  So far, a great book to read.
0307155102|5.0|Greatest little children's book ever. This has been a must have in our family for generations. The colorful, easy to follow, fun pictures keep little children interested and entertained, and teach  colors, shapes, numbers, letters, household items, food, fruits, professions, and everyday occurrences.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I found the previous version much easier to use. I hate this revamp and new look so much I downloaded a different weather app to use going forward.... why fix what wasn't broken.
B003YLM78K|4.0|This is a yearly Christmas season tradition in our family. Equally loved by men and women. Tells multiple interwoven stories of very funny, somewhat tragic events surrounding people meeting and  finding love. This is a British film with  some funny not graphic sexual scenes (call it PG-16). May not be suitable for first date, little kids or  to show to your inlaws, but it's one of my favorite movies
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The story was magical and made me contemplate on my on childhood vs. Current space and time. A fast read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|How refreshing to have good old fashioned clear, makes-sense, keeps you on the edge of your seat writing again.  Not since Grisham's early books have I been so excited to read a good suspense!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Addicted ... I added it on my kindle and it works fine but my Boyfriend added it on his tablet and it works like crap
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|My Grandson wants to watch this movie all day long. He gets up and dances with them.<br />I can put the movie in,  then go do my housework because he becomes glued to the TV.
140006922X|5.0|Why would anyone rate a book they have not read?<br /><br />Oh yes, Fox News said this guy was a bad man because he is a Muslim.<br /><br />Now, I remember -- why this country is going down in flames.<br /><br />Ignorance and hatred seems common fare for the right wing these days.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It was exciting and fun. People of all ages can and should play it. I loved it so much I couldn't get off of. it.
0738737909|5.0|I just love this deck!! This is going to be a deck that I will use to read for others. The art work is absolutely beautiful with great details. The colors are vibrant and I find that these cards do talk to me which is really important if they are to be used to do readings for others. They do follow after the Rider decks even though the colors are so much more vibrant and the cards come to life for me. This is a wonderful deck to have. I highly recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|HI IM 12 AND THIS AP WAS AMAZING,MY MOM HAS A PINTREST TOO AND SHE SAIT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTABULOUS
B002ZBN13A|5.0|Amy Lee rocks and I'm not sure what else to say.  I could listen to this album any time, but particularly like bringing it along on a workout.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game so much I kill the battery on my kindle. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves run games
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|I would recommend this one. The language they're using in the future is a little annoying because you can't understand what they are saying most of the time but its a worth-while rental!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Me and my friend used to play all the time together, but the update ruined it. Now we need to login into a mojang account now. What lever happened to playing without an account? Will we ever get it back? I miss the old minecraft. Where we could play without a moving account.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app does everything I need it to do. The countdown finger is a nice bonus. Love that u can set do many different ones since my  schedule varies from day to day, not your typical Monday thru Friday work weekt
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Downloaded this since I knew it would be like Subway Surfer and Temple Run and thought the kids would like it.  Sadly all it really does is take forever to reload after your minion dies, then it bugs you to use real money to buy imaginary things and wants you to harass your facebook friends into blocking you for all of your game requests.<br /><br />Also - don't forget to put on your Kindle parental controls or you could be out some big bucks on this one.<br /><br />I'll let the kids play the rest of the day but I'll likely uninstall tonight.  Sad though - it could have been a lot of fun.<br /><br />EDITED 8/19/13 - I now have this on my Galaxy sIII phone and it works much better than on my Kindle - perhaps it is a format issue between the two devices.  I would give the version on the phone 4 stars (still not 5 because of the delays and constant nagging to buy more) - much better than my original experience.<br /><br />My original review was 2 stars now moved to 3 stars because I'd like it to work equally well on both devices.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Great app. Great graphics. Missing radar unless i just cant find it. Too bad because i really love the layout, graphics, and content
B0030B621W|4.0|This was a good watch. Didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised by the story and effects. Not too over the top.
B005SS2QXS|5.0|One of the best features of this case is something you can't see in the pictures. The headphone jack opening is actually large enough to plug in something other than earbuds. I ended up removing my previous (Speck) case on a daily basis, just to plug speakers into the phone at home. The Griffin Protector is a low-profile, nicely textured case with smartly-sized openings. I didn't actually know this when I purchased it, and it'd be great if smartphone case companies starting providing a top view of their products, to make this small detail easier to determine while shopping.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Not too much to say. No surprises. Syrupy sweet. Same oddly gifted voice. Music offers little originality. Still, it's Rod.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Not sure if this is a false positive, but Avast reports that this app contains malware. This is as of 7/28/2013. I've removed it until I can find out for sure.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This movie held my interest though it did bog down at times in I suppose was an attempt add seriousness to an already serious plot.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Philip Phillips sings and plays guitar in a very contemporary way - eclectic in sound, but universal in his lyrics.  This collection offers something for everyone.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|And I don't usually jump while watching a horror film because they seldom give me reason to. This one was pleasantly different.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I gave my opinion in the star score. I don't want to have to spend more time on something that takes time away from my other activities.  I won't review any more after this batch.  It is a pain and time consuming.  Not a good way of getting feedback from your customer.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|The novel is simultaneously three things at once: (1) a satirical send-up of Star Trek and all of its derivative-type of sci-fi, (2) a celebratory tribute to them, and (3) a serious novel in its own right. In this sense, it is very similar to the wonderful movie \\"Galaxy Quest\\", which is also all three of these things.<br /><br />The writing is superb, the pacing and tension-building are expertly done, the characters are real, and the cliches and tropes are intentional and masterfully used in the context of this particular story. It is neither \\"smug\\" nor \\"self-satisfied\\", as one 1-star reviewer put it. It is truly one of the most original and entertaining novels you will read in quite a while, and like \\"Galaxy Quest\\", has its own redemptive tale to tell apart from the \\"Star Trek\\" pastiche.
6305428050|4.0|Hardly serious cinema, but so much fun!  I particularly enjoyed the scenes in the blues club and on the cat walk in the chop shop.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I have a great time playing the game but sometimes I wish it was faster. I do have a tendancey to think that, though.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This novel felt like so much more than a debut novel. It felt wonderful and powerful and tinged with emotion, and I walked away from it with a sense of enrichment and fulfillment. Had I not read THE SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, I'd still be the same person I am now, but I would've missed out on this opportunity to forget who I was for a few hours over the course of this character driven tale. Although this story is dark and psychological and filled with regret and anger and frustration, I'd still say I obtained a certain amount of pleasure from this story, mainly because the characters felt lifelike with realistic problems, and I was so enamored with this tale that Pat Peoples could have been my next door neighbor and Tiffany could have lived on the next block over.<br /><br />And not just because Tiffany and Pat took to the pavement with as much joy as I do, getting a runner's high with every mile, the endorphins shooting through their veins the same way an IV drip would. And not just because Pat and Jake and Dr. Cliff Patel and Mr. Peoples and the Asian Invasion felt as much love for the Philadelphia Eagles as I do the Pittsburgh Steelers, bouncing on air with every win and feeling every loss like a swift kick to the groin. But because despite Tiffany's and Pat's problems, both of them still view life with a certain amount of optimism, and despite their flaws--and let's face it both of them have a few--they are better people for not being perfect, for recognizing their defects and embracing their differences, and lifting themselves up when they could just as easily show rapid signs of despair. There's strength and power in recognizing you're not perfect.<br /><br />I'd be remiss without mentioning the voice which felt like it was encased in childlike wonder and hope and strength, and I embraced it head-on without sidestepping or looking away or skirting off the dance floor. And I loved the rather unique way this story was told, coupled with the eight letters in the latter half of this tale, so much so that I just had to purchase THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER, which as I understand it is told almost entirely, if not entirely, through letters and in some ways has a similar structure and feel.<br /><br />Had I not heard of the movie, I might not have heard of this novel, and that would have been a tragedy of infinite proportions. There are few better ways to embrace a literary world than with a healthy dose of realism, and this novel explores several of these avenues with a cast of convincing characters.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatortter half of this tale, so much so that I just had to purchase THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER, which as I understand it is told almost entirely, if not entirely, through letters and in some ways has a similar structure and feel.<br /><br />Had I not heard of the movie, I might not have heard of this novel, and that would have been a tragedy of infinite proportions.

034580709X|4.0|I am only half way through and it is a little slow for a Harry Hole story.  Hope it picks up.
0060776579|4.0|I like the approach of how to have a different mind set and then work towards that mind set with your actions. Good read.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|The movie was just fine - entertaining, suspenseful, and sufficient action. I didn't like that it couldn't be watched in HD on my computer, and the last 20 minutes or so was interrupted several times for buffering. I tolerate that on free videos, but not when I have paid to watch something.
B008469DGY|5.0|I never played golf before so was unsure about this game but it is so easy anyone can do it. And you will have hours of fun. You just swipe with your finger in the direction of the flag and try to get a hole in one. Now I have been able to get a few hole in one's and you can too with just a little practice. This is one of the best games out there if you are ever in a place like a doctors office where you have to wait it makes the time go buy so fast.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|While I'm sure that British readers get more jokes than US readers, it's still a good read. There are lots of interesting plot twists - not that this should surprise anyone who ever read anything else by Pratchett - and a satisfactory number of ironic events. Don't look for a lot of serious commentary. You'll probably understand the seriousness of what's presented after you finish the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is alot of fun and it's free. But you can only go so far then you have to buy coins and i'm not sure how far they go as I haven't bought any yet. I do wish there was a way to slow the man running down just till you get use to all the jumps and turns you have to make. But other then that this is a great game and hours of fun.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|When I started this book, I was not sure what I was going to think of it. As it turned out I found it to be very intriguing and a tremendous statement about our world. The forum that Brooks chose to use for his tale was different from most stories of this type. It certainly gave a different view of humanity.
B002JVWQSW|1.0|The first episode in it doesn't work at all and some of epidoes do as well. I gave it to someone staying abroad, so I cannnot take any actions.  I wish I could return or exchage it.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Having read all of James Rollin's books, I have to say he outdid himself with this one. It is fast paced, immersive and most imaginative. He treatment at the end was really amazing. I can hardly wait for his next promised Sigma tale next summer (2014)
B006ZZAN60|5.0|She is so talented and has the voice of an angel, and a wonderful band.  I love it when she laughs.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|This show is one of the best my wife and I have every watched.  it is well written and acted.  This is a must see show.  Watch all the seasons to get the whole story.  Don't miss!!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Incredible urban fantasy. Atticus will capture you with Oberon at his heels. I can't wait to get to the rest of the series!!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game is really good. Makes you think. Lots of cool puzzles. Hours of fun if you into solving mysteries and such. Great job G5. Can't wait for more like it.
B0027MJU00|3.0|My book club read this book as our July selection. We liked to much more than &#34;Gone Girl&#34; but it still had many disturbing qualities. She has a style of writing that takes you back and forth from time past to present and from one character to another. Sometimes it is hard to follow. The ending of this one wasn't as easy to figure out as &#34;Gone Girl&#34;. Overall we enjoyed discussing the people and events.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Another brilliant book by child. If your a Reacher fan you won't be able to put it down. As good as any of the others. Keep churning them out Lee
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely have fallen in love with this app. I am a huge fan of despicable me and this game really brings the movie to life.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Not LeCarre's best.  A different direction of his characters.  But still good enough to hold your interest.  Glad he still writes.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I liked it very much as it was practical and allowed to download some formats that a Mac could not.
0812550706|4.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend because he mentioned he's been wanting to read it. I'm sure it won't disappoint! So far he's really liking it. It delivered on time and in great condition.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I've only had this game for two weeks and already almost have everything unlocked and have 20000000 coins! I love this game! I would play this game over any other game any time! And I love that you don't need WiFi because every game I want needs WiFi. I can actually play it in the car or at a public place with no WiFi.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Love this game. It is so fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who has free time. Not all is easy but most is
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really enjoyed and loved watching Suits. They developed all the characters so well and they are all so different and unique. Looking forward to watching the 3rd season.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|This movie is exactly what it promises to be. It lives up to its completely outrageous premise. Nice Tim Burton action there too.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Regardless of the religion of the author, I applaud anyone who takes the time to contextualize individuals or events from the ancient world.
1476727910|5.0|Professor Andrew Martin, a Cambridge University mathematician and scholar, is world renowned for his theory on numbers and is a published author. He is also self-obsessed, emotionally unavailable to his wife, Isobel, and his troubled son, Gulliver, and has spent the better part of his adult life seeking to solve the unsolvable hypothesis of late German math prodigy Bernhard Riemann.<br /><br />Thus, when an alien visitor from the planet Vonnadorian literally takes the place of Andrew, there is not much to notice. Initially not knowing how to act as a human or behave in our society, the \\"new\\" Andrew proceeds to remove all the uncomfortable clothing he is wearing and gets picked up by authorities for streaking through the town square. He is placed in a local insane asylum for observation, and the ultimate determination is that he had a brief breakdown as a result of working too hard. In fact, he is working quite hard --- specifically to understand the ways and thinking patterns of human beings. At first, he finds them a repulsive species and is repelled by their look, attire and food preference.<br /><br />Andrew immerses himself in everything he can get his hands on to read. This explains why his awkward social responses are a combination of reading classic literature, the poetry of Emily Dickinson, and Cosmopolitan magazine. He muses that if you want to appear sane on Earth, you have to be in the right place, wearing the right clothes, saying the right things, and only stepping on the right kind of grass.<br /><br />The new Andrew finds music to be amusing, with some being annoying and other pieces --- like Debussy's Clair de Lune --- that instantly remind him of his own universe. Because this version of Andrew is so utterly different, he is gradually found more acceptable to his family. The real Andrew was having an affair with a student and heading towards divorce, while the new Andrew finds Isobel to be fascinating. He also had a broken relationship with Gulliver, who constantly feels the pressure of being the son of a great intellectual. The new Andrew finds ways to connect with the boy in simple ways and ultimately saves his life.<br /><br />However, it is not all fun and games as Andrew is constantly reminded by his superiors on Vonnadorian about his mission. The fact that the real Andrew was indeed close to solving Riemann's hypothesis is what prompted them to send the visitor to take his place and glean this knowledge for their own benefit. That includes eliminating anyone in Andrew's life who may have known he was close to solving it --- his wife, son, and best friend Ari.<br /><br />THE HUMANS is a breathtaking novel that demands a wide audience. To see and experience all that it means to be a human being through the eyes of a seemingly perfect being is eye-opening and endlessly fascinating. The new Andrew grows to accept what it means to be mortal and human --- and begins desiring to stay permanently in human form. Matt Haig has created a masterpiece of fiction --- filled with science fiction elements as well as passages that depict external and internal beauty --- that should be required reading for all who inhabit this great big ball we call Earth.<br /><br />Reviewed by Ray Palen
140006922X|5.0|I am buying this sight unseen, which I rarely do. It sounds fascinating and I'm confident it will be an excellent read. Even more to the point, all people who value scholarship and humanism should buy this book as a show of support after the ludicrous interview with Dr. Aslan on Fox - and in response to the monstrous comments about him posted right here on Amazon. Aslan is a gentleman and a scholar, and he should be treated as such.
B00DGKQF2S|4.0|I was skeptical about a super group of players that have been in bands that aren't my favorites nor was I familiar with their work with the exception of Billy Sheehan. The biggest surprise was the quality of the songs and Richie kotzens singing. The great guitar bass and drum playing are a given but this is not just a guitar players album. The songs are really solid.
B002KLOPF8|4.0|I liked the movie especially since I am a veteran. I did feel for Pyle but I think every platoon has one like him. R. Lee Ermey is the real deal. I like watching Gunney  in the movies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice little game tricky enough but we NEED more levels please, family game. Looking forward to new challenges when they come.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Anna Torv is unbelievable. Also like the Walter Bishop character. This is X Files caliber show.
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|Their first album in years.  Had to buy it.  Still got that magical sound that's so simple and yet very haunting.  Love it!
B0092G1O8A|5.0|this was a gift for my husband and he was so surprised and he has watched this many times. loves the movie
B005544TRQ|5.0|We really enjoyed it. Great character development. We loved watching and can't wait for the next season to come out.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Good series. If you are a fan of Dr. Who, you will enjoy this series. Can't wait to see the rest of the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely loved this game! Wasn't too easy but also wasn't too difficult to where I wanted to give up. I can't wait to get more levels to this game!
B007N85POS|5.0|My son absolutely loves angry birds rio. He enjoys playing it more than the original and angry birds Star Wars.
B00A8M7H42|5.0|This is my first of this line of the DC new 52, and I'm getting rest! Great weight, and paint job, the overall sculpt is fantastic. Love it!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I recomend this book as something with great value in the management job. It is not a baseball book even when every fan will find it very interesting. It is a book of value in learning how to do things without depending on money
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. I found her transitions from character to character well done & easy to follow. I see that some readers said it was hard to follow but as long as you are paying attention I found it easy. It is full of twists and turns that I did not expect. The way she describes the scenery made me long to be in the gardens myself. It is a tale full of heartbreak but also so full of hope. Great ending too! I definitely recommend reading this book!
0393338398|5.0|The book is excelent and the film is not disapointing. Brad Pitt gives life to Billy Bean. When you read the book and see the film you appreciate the work done by Mr. Pitt. Great Actor, not just a handsome guy
0307719774|5.0|I purchased this product because I thought it was such a great idea. So far it is holding up well & don't think I will have any problems with it. It is small but I do not have any problems writing in it. I am excited to look back at this years later and reflect.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|i am a fan of Richard Dean Anderson, from macgyver to stargate sg1, and i just enjoy his deliver method, his personality that comes out in his characters.  the original macgyver was a treat to find on here, and i will continue to watch it.  i haven't seen them since i was a kid, but they still continue to be a part of our pop culture.  his name has come to mean making something work with few tools and resources, sometimes building your own devices with unrelated items.  it's fantastic.  the video quality is pretty good, the sound is stable on all episodes i have watched.  all in all, i endorse it to fans of ingenuity and creativity.
140006922X|5.0|This book is a very fascinating and well written book. It matters not what the personal religion of the author is, because he is an academic who specializes in religion. It is his lifes work to study religion, including the New Testament. In fact I could guarantee he knows more about Christianity and the man called Jesus, than most Christians do. I think that all the bad reviews this book is receiving are just because some people do not like the idea of their religion being questioned. I hope to read more of Reza Aslan's work in the future.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Love/sex on every page. Decent read. Not the best book I've ever read, but definitely entertaining. Hard to get lost when things get so impractical.
B008Y76VW2|5.0|simple and easy and great ending i love it when movies end good awesome and simple a must see :))
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|Bought the rig about 4 months ago..cannot get it to balance bought a laing stabilizer (glidecam style) its much better.Now the opteka is collecting dust. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AVOID THIS and save up for a glidecam. the position of the gimbal is the reason for this.<br /><br />you are welcome.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|My brother-in-law recommended this and I bought it.  I have only watched two of the dvd's so far but it has been very well done with veteran testimonials/comments in addition to Sir Laurence Olivier's narrative.  It brought to life the &#34;Greatest Generation&#34; and their contribution to our country and freedom.  Well worth watching.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was an entertaining read with an attention-holding story.  My actual rating is 3 1/2 stars as I found some of the writing a bit glib.  One or 2 characters could've been more fully developed but after all it is a thriller.  If that's what you're looking for, you'll enjoy this one.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban is always a winner in my book. I could listen to him all day long. Good selection of songs.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We absoutely loved it. Then season 2 & 3....all 69 shows.  Can't wait till Season 4 goes Prime!  Alica is a sweetheart.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Very enjoyable. From heart wrenching to heartwarming. A book that you'll be glad you read. I will recommend to my friends.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton abbey is one of the most fantastic period dramas that exists and that's coming from a guy that likes sitcoms and action adventure series. This show is simply enchanting, mesmerizing, enrapturing. My girlfriend and I have enjoyed every moment of watching this show together.<br />Guys, if you haven't seen it, watch it. Girls, if you want to watch it, I can almost assure you that if you put it on with your man around, he'll be asking for you to wait for him for the next episode.<br />BTW start at season 1 if you haven't already.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I used these to mount my Star Wars light sabers to the wall.  This part held the handle and the C-Cell mount held the light.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|It is what it says it is: a great transfer of an entertaining film homage to the generation that grew up playing video games.  I no longer need the DVD as Blu-ray drives are pretty ubiquitous, but the digital copy might help parents playback on cheaper devices (say, in the car or on a tablet on a plane).
B003VANOFY|1.0|Sound is distorted and makes my Pc Crash. The on and off button doesn't work. I gave it one star because it is comfortable.<br />The help on support is worthless.
B00932A4XE|5.0|Nice look at being a new dad. Loved Chris Rock in the film , but wished he could have had a bigger role in the film.

006198969X|5.0|My daughter loves fashion and this book was exactly what she was looking for.  She talks about fashion tips and ideas she gets from this book frequently.  I would recommend to any teen girl.
B000W8OM5Y|4.0|As a veteran it still saddens me to see it takes the loss of the best of us to win anything of importance, a lot of personal loss here to temper the mood of seeing Braveheart.
0738212415|5.0|Brand new as promised. All is how described, Book is a great choice for me as an artist of drawing & painting.
078322804X|5.0|Implausable to be sure but a real rocker the way many of us would like to operate; GO FOR IT !
0634022296|1.0|In this copy of the book<br />pages from 73 to 96 repeat two times<br />and pages from 97 to 120 missing
B0000542DJ|5.0|I was 15 when JFK was killed and have been suspicious of the Warren Report ever since, kudos to O. Stone for this.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|Kinda hard to navigate and it is super super super super slow and sometimes does weird things, but it has a really good selection and quality. I will continue to use it (until something better comes along).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are what I would call a little racy, but if you hang in there, the story behind these is very good.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like a easy but thinking game. I can even play it while talking on the phone. It's fun to figure out new routes.
0811875040|3.0|I purchased this book after visiting the shop in San Francisco. The store is beautiful. This book really is a memory or token of the visit. The book is beautiful too. I like cooking and baking but I haven't attempted any of the recipes as they seem complicated. Most of recipes require a lot of extra equipment needed to make the cakes.<br />Overall I'm happy with the book as it is pretty and will be a keepsake, but as for using as a cookbook - I have other books I prefer.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I am watching all the seasons free with my Amazon Prime.  Had not ever been able to see the show before and as a avid original Star Trek fan wasn't sure about it. I am truly enjoying every episode. You won't regret watching it.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|After installing the update this game will no longer open on my Kindle Fire.  Therefore, I have lost all levels and points that I had acquired.  Not very happy to say the least.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I can't remember how long it has been since I have seen a classic sci-fi movie. All the recent entries in the genre have been either superhero movies or bombastic-boom-boom-shoot-em-up-alien-invasion ones. And while Oblivion does tread familiar ground sometimes it gets 5 stars by comparison with its peers in the industry at the moment. On its own, it is technically superb with a great sweeping soundtrack, well presented minimalist art direction, stunning landscapes, great acting from a small and excellent cast and tight screenplay that keeps your attention (if you have been longing from a reprieve of movies with giant ball of fires every 2 minutes). This movie also manages to stand on its own without the need for sequels which probably means it gets another 5 stars just for that.<br /><br />From the end credits, it seems that it has been adapted from an unpublished graphic novel and the writer of said novel directs this movie so I guess I saw his vision of his book. And it's only after I came here that I realized that he directed TRON Legacy too (another excellent movie). Hats off to Joseph Kosinski.<br /><br />Whatever you think about Tom Cruise, he sure as heck can deliver a great action/sci-fi movie. This one revolves around him and he carries it effortlessly while displaying a wide variety of emotions ever so subtly. His supporting cast is very good in general but I thought that Andrea Risenborough displayed a wider set of emotions really well and it probably would have been better if she and Olga Kurylenko had switched roles. Morgan Freeman, Coster-Waldau and Leo deliver excellent performances with the little screen time they have and to be honest I really like movies where the director manages to make a story around a small set of characters work well.<br /><br />This is a very good sci-fi movie. If you have ever read sci-fi short stories (Dick, Asimov etc.) and ever wondered how it would be on film, this would be a good example.
0060958324|3.0|Too much slow old man detail, couldn't get past page 80 after 8 months. Just too slow for me, if you like description that goes on for pages about the scenery or gear to wear or just long boring talking this is the book for you. My best friend loves this book but if your not into detail and nothing happening its not for you.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Used Amazon Prime so I could watch the episodes on my schedule. I'm now on Episode 9 - not even halfway through Season 1. So far I'm thrilled with it all including: casting, writing, actors, MUSIC, choreography, etc.  So looking forward to many more GLEEful hours of quality entertainment.
B00BVYLBP2|1.0|Not my type of show. The plot could be interesting but they have to show so much immorality and sex that I don't like it
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Liked the book.  Scientific in nature.  Sometimes too much medical language but understand author's need to incorporate.  Would recommend this book.  Very interesting concept.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Bruce at his best!  Even at sixty years old this man gives as much as ever; rocking out for hours.  He loved it, the crowd loved it and so did I!
0385349947|5.0|Recommend it for any woman, new in her career or advanced. Tremendous read that I recommend now to all of my coworkers (women and men alike!)
B00D7NRHX0|5.0|That bi-polar gravity worlds are so close to each other that they can almost touch is incredibly creative, but to make each living condition as different as night and day, and so on and so forth... And if you are a true romanticist as well, this is a MUST SEE!!
B002SHD9E2|5.0|The movie version of The Phantom brings so much more into the storyline. I truly enjoyed their lighting and extra effects!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|excellent music, story line, acting, wish it had not ended. will you have he second season soon? look forward to this second half
B002SGYPS2|5.0|Jim Carey is such a funny guy, but he shows true depth in this serious movie about how we are all manipulated I life. We have to find our true love not what society intends for us.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|all is well with Downton Abbey. This is the best series to come along in years. The period features are amazing

140006922X|1.0|As a seasoned law researcher and law brief writer to high level federal courts, I can assure you that I also researched this issue of \\"zealot\\" being foisted upon our Lord and Savior by various arrogant writers--and have looked at over 1000+ books on Christian history that I own in my little library--and, no one suggested that our Lord Yeshua was a \\"zealot\\"! True, there were only 2 former \\"zealots\\" in His circle, and possibly the \\"traitor\\"! And, of course, there was a former \\"tax collector\\"... but, this aspect has no bearing on him after his \\"repentance\\"--and so it is with the other 2 former \\"zealots\\" who repented from their sins! Yeshua will not tolerate an \\"unrepentant\\" person in His closest circle! Get this well in your mind! Yeshua has NOT changed since! He will NOT tolerate an unrepentant person in His circle! Let this FACT sink in your mind!!! The Muslim \\"convert\\" thinks that Yeshua had something to do with the \\"zealot\\" movement in Judea aimed against Roman imperial jurisdiction exercised at times with impunity against the Jews! Contrarily, if the zealot movement would have taken His ADVICE to heart--to \\"turn the other cheek\\"--emperor Vespasian and his sons would NOT have prosecuted the immense destruction of the Temple at Jerusalem and punish many of its elder inhabitants by crucifixion! The zealots or \\"secari\\" were the \\"causa sine qua non\\" for Yeshua's disciples troubles and His followers at a later time in the Antiochia's territory!! So, all this \\"zealot\\" conjecture gathered from bias sources does NOT stand the test of biblical history as revealed to us by the sincer and thoughtful evangelist Luke and Yeshua's appointed apostle Paul!<br />There are a myriad of better books to read--many by highly distinguished Oxford professors such as F.F. Bruce who really demonstrate that our Lord Yeshua was never a \\"zealot\\", or even endorsing the \\"zealot\\" activities aimed against Romans!<br />People who portray Yeshua in this kind of false light grossly defame His holy character! Furthermore, credible history of that time, written by Jewish historian Josephus, and also by Eusebius (Church's historian at that time) clearly CONFIRM the uncontroverted historical FACT that Yeshua was never referred to by any of them as a \\"zealot\\", or naively endorsing the SEDITIOUS activities of \\"zealots\\" against the formidable Roman imperial power!!<br />Anthony Ianosel, L.C.
193700788X|2.0|I was a little disappointed in this book. I thought it was overly long and a little boring at times. I guess I just loved the earlier books of Sookie and Eric and their romance. I think it was time to end Sookie's story because frankly I am not sure there is much more to say about her. I think Charlaine needed to end it and it was time. I love True Blood but wish they had followed the books more. If you are a fan of Sookie then read the end and see how you feel about her last story.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Come now... On its own this film stands up as a semi-decent action film of the Bruce Willis ilk. It's crashy and smashy and at times unbelievable, and it's all served up in a predictably Hollywood-esque style. Nothing wrong with that at all. But to call this a \\"Die Hard\\" film (I've really enjoyed all of the quadrilogy before this) just doesn't sit well with me. If I was a cynic (and I am) I'd say this was a hardly-camouflaged let's-make-a-quick-buck flick which jumps kicking and screaming onto the back of a great reputation and does it no good whatsoever.<br /><br />I had to trawl through a few sites to remind myself that previous films have shown that McClane even has a son at all - let's face it he's hardly been a regular in the series and I was watching the film thinking \\"Where has this son suddenly come from!?\\". The setting is random and I can imagine red lights and alarms going off in the corridors of the Kremlin itself if the name McClane went within seven hundred miles of an Aeroflot check-in desk. I mean, he's got to be on some kind of watch list of \\"People where stuff seems to blow up around them on a regular basis\\" by now... I'm not really sure why this film wasn't called something like \\"Bruce Willis Cracks a Horrid Russian Gang And It's A Bit Like Die Hard\\", because in my view this isn't a Die Hard film. It's decent enough, and if it's on telly in 5 years time I'll probably sit there patiently wading through the adverts till gone midnight when I really should've gone to bed earlier on a school night. But the lightness and comedy interspersed within the seriousness wasn't present. There are no evil henchmen arguing quietly over whether to take a bomb in their car with them in order to protect children from finding it in the street. There's no \\"I've think I've just seen...Elvis. Elvis Presley\\" moments.<br /><br />It's also gone down an intelligence notch. Radiation hoovering? I mean, McClane did \\"shoot\\" down a chopper with a car in the previous film but atleast that was pure boyish silliness. And it might work in real life...maybe...possibly...well OK... But neutralising radiation with a vaccuum cleaner had me shaking my head a little. Nobody (not even me in my most open-minded mood) can take that seriously.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's an okay game with many activities and goals to meet. It can be a con for this game because the challenges mound up and become evermore difficult

B00005JMXX|5.0|When I first saw or better yet sat through the viewing of this film, I was convinced that this was just another on of those Hollywood spectaculiar disaster films(2004).  I wrote it off as fantasy.  In 2009 I veiwed it again, still did not think it was anything but entertainment.  This year I have viewed this film three times.  Frankly,  it scares the c--p out of me.  Those theoretical weather models are no longer fantasy.  Sometime maybe within our lifetime, or our children's lifetime, most assuredly in our grandchildre's lifetime, this weather event will happen.  It happend 50,000+/- 2,000 years ago and it will occur without resprite.  The major engines of such a change are in the major ocean currents surrounding every continent on this planet.  We have already had a small sample during the latter half of the 18th Century.  Look it up under Mini-Ice-Age. This film is to become a forcaster of things to come.  If you have not seen it, please do not miss it.  Either purchase it or watch it on the cable-tv circuit.  NJMJr!

0451169514|5.0|This was my first Stephen King novel and still my favorite. Though 300 pages or so could easily be lopped off, Stephen King's It is an incredibly absorbing tale about a group of outcasts who become friends. These seven kids encounter an terrible evil. It goes by many names and forms including Pennywise the Clown. The best part of the novel is the amazing depth of the characters. You will get to know them well and identify with them. The scary part is not knowing what It is or what It wants. Sometimes it's the evil you don't see that is truly terrifying. Yet the kids must battle It repeatedly throughout the book.<br /><br />Buy this book. Also see Stephen King's Eyes of the Dragon for his best fantasy novel.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Admitting that any understanding of a topic with such little verifiable evidence will have to be in part subjective, Aslan synthesizes and personalizes the most up-to-date secular scholarly research on the historical person of Jesus.  This is an enjoyable read for anyone willing to critically reexamine the new testament narrative underpinning the dogmas of Christian faith.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|I love this series.  Not once when I was watching it did I think &#34;I can tell she's pretending to be someone else&#34;. She truly makes you believe you're watching five other characters! !

B001XUPF2O|4.0|Heath Ledger plays a great villain and the sound effects are awesome. But, it's not the batman I remember as a kid.
B000SEFNMS|3.0|I was expecting the book to be more about surviving or not in the AK wilderness. Seems more like the book was a chance for the author to expound his own feats and his long lost dreams. Well written and thoroughly researched though.
B0091REZMW|3.0|So far the game is pretty cool. Graphics are well done. However I have just started playing and can tell the developers have designed this game to get you to spend as much money as possible. Still can't tell if this will be worth continuing to play.
0062255657|3.0|This isn't really Neil Gaiman's best work by far but it is still an okay story.  The ending is lacking.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|First released with the tagline \\"A Divinely Decadent Experience\\" - Bob Fosse's film retains its power to shock forty years after its original release. Beautifully filmed, with a brilliant use of intercuts between the musical songs and scenes of sickening violence in the Berlin of the early 1930s, the film provides an object-lesson in how a musical in film should work, with the songs commenting on as well as advancing the plot.  Liza Minnelli is quite simply the definitive Sally Bowles, combining boundless self-confidence with an innate vulnerability.  She shows a mastery of tone and shade in her rendition of some of the tunes - in the title song, for instance, she recalls her mother at her best, whereas in the song \\"Maybe This Time,\\" she reveals the character's inner yearning for a better life.  Likewise Joel Grey is definitive as the Emcee - a vicious parodist who knows precisely what the songs mean in terms of satirizing Germany at the beginning of Nazi rule.  Michael York's \\"Brian Roberts\\" (actually Christopher Isherwood) is both bemused yet appalled at what happens around him; he can never become actively involved either in the anti-Nazi movement or the decadent world of the Kit-Kat Club due to his respectable upbringing.  He can escape from Nazi Germany; sadly neither Sally nor the Emcee have that privilege.  This is the film's principal tragedy.
B00181JGI2|5.0|A great classic movie, it was what I expected!!! The DVD showed up just fine when it was expected.  Enjoy.

B003B02O0U|4.0|Taking a break from the cloak and Dagger stuff for a while, so I went back to Grisham. Like his other books, Grisham's exposition is very deliberate and complete allowing the reader to connect to the characters and watch sub plots converge. Great story. Couldn't wait to \\"hear\\" what was in the brief and crossed my fingers for Darby as she dodged her pursuers the whole way. The conclusion was satisfactory yet somewhat anticlimactic.

B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This was an obvious play to setup for sequels with the new character.  Die Hard is equal to Bruce and not this other weaker actor.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|I purchased this one when it came out and was amazed at how great the performance and quality of video and audio is. My wife and I saw the tour in the fall after this show. We saved watching the disc until almost the one year anniversary of the show and watched it with the lights off, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, yeah! This is in my book, by far, the best Springsteen concert on video. This was the closest that you can come to feel like you were there. While I think the Live in NYC disc is good, I never really felt like I was at the show, and don't get me started on changing the running order of the songs. London Calling is a great, great Springsteen disc and one I recommend to anyone who has not been fortunate enough to see the band at full power. I only wish Bruce could take a cue from Pearl Jam and release every single show to the fans.<br /><br />I agree with the one reviewer who said the biggest fault was that Bruce was not close enough to the audience, and that does take a bit away, the man lives off the crowd, and they him. But it is still as close to being there as you can get. Just buy this one and pretend you were there!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything about this series is great. The characters and the storyline are always intriguing. I eagerly await next season. A must watch.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob kept me glued to the pages from beginning to end. Nothing prepared me for the knock-out ending. Legal thrillers are not my forte, but William Landay made following the nuances of this one a piece of cake. My own changing loyalties to the various  characters jerked me from side to side as the story unfolded, and the ending took my breath away. Strongly recommend this novel for an exciting read.
B00CGW0F6Y|3.0|This film had an interesting, timely plot: cults and their influence(s). Marcy and her sister, Lucy, are reunited after Marcy's escape from a controlling, potentially violent cult. At first, Lucy seemed happy and relieved to be reunited with her younger sister.....but that soon changes. Lucy and her English husband are obviously upper-middle-class, socially involved people. When Marcy exhibited inappropriate behavior or thoughts/opinions, Lucy and especially her husband seemed more irritated than concerned about what had happened to Marcy previously. I am myself an older sister and I found it hard to relate to Lucy, who seemed less concerned about Marcy's physical and mental/emotional well-being, or any trauma that she might have endured, than she just wanted Marcy to 'snap out of it' or 'be normal.' At many times during the film, I thought that Marcy had escaped one cult only to be plunged into another sort of one with her sister and sister's husband. Lucy kept trying to make Marcy be like her.....an uptight, thin-lipped, impatient, only-concerned-with-outward appearances young woman. After a while and towards the end of the movie, it seemed that Lucy was only interested in 'getting rid of' Marcy because 'we're trying to start a family and I don't feel safe having you around.' During one verbal confrontation between Marcy and Lucy, Marcy exclaims to Lucy, 'You're gonna be a terrible mother!' I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone but I'll just say that you're left with the impression that Marcy's not nearly out of the woods (pardon the pun) in so far as the cult is concerned.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Actually fantasy is not my cup of tea, but this novel kept me interested to the final page. Fantastic as it is, it becomes more and more believable as the story unfolds. An excellent read. The interplay between a &#34;normal&#34; boy and a &#34;fantasy-inclined&#34; girl is presented so skillfully that the whole relationship seems &#34;normal.&#34; I did find myself looking for some allegorical link to life, but identified none.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|If this book was by any other author and had any other main character, I'd give it a 5 star rating. But, by Lee Child/Jack Reacher standards, it's disappointing.<br /><br />I read all the reviews of the book and avoided it for many months. Then I bought it because I needed a Reacher fix. The book started off slow... but it's not out of character for Child to play with words, play with numbers, play with characters, and play with the reader's head. He did this in spades for the first 1/3rd of the book. It was like Waiting for Godot or something... we were waiting for something to happen and instead, Child plays with words and numbers and winds the characters up and sees how they'll play.<br /><br />The rest of the book was a little more of a moral high-horse than normal Reacher books, but it's not unexpected and the editorializing about the Patriot Act and such was welcome to me.<br /><br />I finished the book in an extended sitting (normal for Reacher books.) The only disappointment was the ending... which was abrupt and less satisfying than it could have been... spoiler: I was hoping the the unknown bad guys where actually DIA which would have completed the whole theme that everybody was chasing phantoms and causing lots of collateral damage by chasing these phantoms. That's what I was expecting.<br /><br />But the bottom line is that this book is worth reading... it's not the best Reacher novel, but it's worth your time to read it.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Goonies is one of the best movies made.  The surround d sound was actually pretty amazing.  We were in our theater room and I actually looked out the window because I thought it was raining.  They did a great job with sound in this movie.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I really loved this game.  I played it, the kids played it.  We liked the challenges and earning the coins and gems.  We unlocked China Girl and loved it.<br />Then the app started acting up, not opening, freezing up, and the HD add on disappeared and now its hard to see some of the icons and pictures.  I emailed support and their advice was sorry you will have to delete it and re-install it.<br />Removing the app (from my Fire HD 9) caused all my progress to be lost.  All the time and energy spent earning things, such as the beloved China girl, completely gone.  And guess what, no HD add on is showing up, so not only is everything gone, but it still didn't fix the problem.<br />My advice - don't buy this app until they fix it so you can save your progress and fix things from just un-installing on the app.<br />I would not spend any money on the app or in the app until they actually make it work.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I got a Kindle a year ago and found hundreds of free books on Amazon.  Somehow my Kindle turns up missing.  I got a tablet and downloaded Kindle,  there was all the free books that I had downloaded, and $200 worth of purchased books.  I was thrilled that I had not lost any.  I have the Kindle app on another tablet and love the way it can keep track of the page I am on.  That is really helpful.  The Kindle app is just great for anything of device.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|We loved playing this game.  It does sometimes get laggy and act up.  But overall it was fun to earn the different characters and try the challenges.<br />However it was unistalled by accident and everything was lost.  All the time and energy getting the characters was gone.  How can you have a game that you earn things over time but can't save or back up your progress? This happens with Temple Run Oz too.<br />Very dissapointed
B00005O3VD|4.0|Received promptly and in NEW condition and will look for future items from seller to purchase in the near future, however it doesn't play well in a blu-ray, haven't tried in a regular dvd player.
B004QSQML8|1.0|I watched the Theatrical Version of this for the first time over the weekend. Wow, what a terrible movie. I'm kind of amazed how great the reviews for it are here. This illustrates the power of nostalgia I think. As long as people like something from the past a little bit, then looking back, what was then - at best - mediocre<br /> becomes something great.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm sure this review is going to get down-voted a lot. There will probably be some angry / annoyed comments, also. Please keep in mind this is my opinion of the movie. I didn't like it, which is why I'm giving it such a low rating. You are entitled to your opinion also, and to rate it as high as you wish.<br /><br />So I love 80's movies. I love fantasy. And I love Ridley Scott. So what's not to love, right? How could a movie like this possibly go wrong? Well, it did. This movie didn't work for me, and here is why:<br /><br />1. Tom Cruise. He was terrible in this movie. I'm not sure what the director was going for when they cast him here, whether they wanted him to be Peter Pan or what, but he seems completely miscast to me. He spent 90% of the movie wandering around with a confused, blank stare on his face. The remaining 10% he spent smiling an ugly crooked-toothed smile that made me wonder if he had robbed those teeth from the set of the Austin Powers movies or what.<br /><br />Tom Cruise looks like he's about 13 years old in this movie. I thought things were looking up when he found a suit of armor. But then he actually looked stupider in the armor than without. I mean, why would you wear a suit of armor with no pants? That alone made it very hard to take him seriously as the hero. He simply looked awful.<br /><br />2. The Characters. The main characters in this movie have zero charisma and zero personality. Tom - when he looks like he's awake - barely registers. Did he even have a pusle? The elves especially stunk. Speaking of which, are they elves? Hobbits? Dwarves? Who knows? They look likea weird mixture of all three. And they were meant to provide comic relief, apparently. Except for one problem: They're not funny.<br /><br />And we also get a creepy elf-boy named Gump. Gump of the Forest, if you will. Or maybe he prefers to be called... Forest Gump? (Rimshot!) Not likeable at all. I kept hoping that the half-naked kid would go away, and he never did. In fact, it was about midway through the movie that it suddenly dawned on me that these are our core main \\"heroes\\", and that we won't be seeing any more. This is the group that we're supposed to cheer for. Wow, what a let-down.<br /><br />3. The Narration at the beginning of the movie. This went on for far too long, explaining way too much. After reading all that, I started wondering what the movie would be like if the narration just continued for another hour and a half, and that was the entire movie, just reading narration.<br /><br />4. The Dialogue. Okay in parts, but there were some pieces that were very anachronistic, and threw me off. Like when the goblins are interrupted by the Dark Lord, and one of them cusses in a very present-day way. That just sounded... off. And then when one of them falls down a hole and yells, \\"Adios, amigos!\\" So, they speak Spanish in this fantasy world, too? Meant to be funny, I guess.<br /><br />5. The Story wasn't very interesting. I'm okay with a simple story, but this one just wasn't compelling at all. And there were weird gaps and plot turns that didn't make any sense. For example:<br /><br />- The 2nd unicorn suddenly shows up captured, and the girl is captured too. There's not much showing how this was actually done.<br /><br />- Darkness doesn't kill the 2nd unicorn right away because... Well, no good reason, I suppose. Except that he needed to fulfill the #1 Most Overly Used Evil Villain Plot Cliche.<br /><br />- Darkness suddenly decides that he loves the princess, and has to woo her. Why? Who knows? I guess so we can drag the movie out longer, since that whole \\"unicorn thing\\" turned out to be a bust.<br /><br />- Apparently all you have to do to turn a princess over to the dark side is flash her with some bling and some fancy dance moves. It seemed to be working out pretty well for him.<br /><br />- The fairy wants Jack to kiss her, then she's angry when he doesn't. It doesn't really matter though, because that story goes nowhere.<br /><br />- An elf fell asleep! For no apparent reason! Will the fairy be able to wake him up in time? Oh, the suspense!<br /><br />- Darkness is killed by sunlight, and is sucked out through a door of his underground lair, into.... space?<br /><br />- The pond is frozen when Jack can't find the ring. Then later when he goes back to get it, it's not frozen anymore. Even though the 1st unicorn is still dead. But I guess he needed it to be unfrozen so he could find the ring and we could finish the story.<br /><br />- Cue the prancing unicorns. Prance, prance, prance!<br /><br />6. The setting was a bit much at times. There was some strange contrasts here. On the one hand, we've got prancing unicorns, perfect for pre-teen girls. Then in the next frame, we're in a dungeon with cannibals chopping up screaming people on a table and eating them live. Is there not something a little bit off about that? Is it a kids movie here or what?<br /><br />As for the good points, yes, this movie did have some. I liked Tim Curry as Darkness. His voice was especially well-done. I also liked the princess. I think that actress did a great job.<br /><br />Where Ridley Scott is always strong is in the cinematography of his movies. The settings, the scenery, all was very interesting and entertaining to see. Although at times I started to wonder why when they were outside, there was always junk floating across the screen all the time. It got to be a bit distracting. Dust, pollen, seeds, flowers, feathers, and at times, even bubbles. (I mean, really? Bubbles? What the heck was up with that?)<br /><br />But overall, the imagery was great. But no matter how great it was, it couldn't overcome the uninteresting characters and flat story. Not for me, anyway.<br /><br />I see a lot people making excuses here, trying to explain why the movie is actually greater than critics give it credit for. Well, sorry folks! I'm just calling it like I see it and I think this movie stinks. I can see why it tanked at the box office.<br /><br />I may watch the Director's Cut sometime just to see if it is any better. I bet Jerry Goldsmith's score is pretty good.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed how the two different time periods were worked together one fact and one fiction. I think this was a good first for Madonna writing and directing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|every day my little brother wants to play on my kindle<br />and I say hell no go get your own.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game made my Kindle freeze.  So I did not really get into the game.  Considering taking off my Kindle
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is one of the better weather apps I've see so far and I just love it.<br />it's better the any of the other apps I had seen so far.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I did not enjoy this read.  Each chapter had new characters at various timelines.  It was<br />difficult to follow.  I like to relax when I'm reading, not work at it.  I would not recommend it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app and it is very accurate. I've been looking for a good weather app for my Kindle.
1439152810|5.0|I loved the development of the story. As I read the novel I really felt drawn in. Of the books I have read from this author this book did not disappoint. The unravelling of the details kept you involved and guessing. As always a touching novel.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez, is a fabulous musician, entertainer and songwriter.  I lived in his hometown at the time he was trying to kick off his career, but like most, did not even know he was around.  His music is wonderful, and as it turns out inspired generations of South Africans during their tough revolutionary days.  &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; an award winning documentary, available from Netflix is a must see for music buffs.  It tells the story of this man's journey and introduced his music to us.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|If you like all or most of these guys and action movies you will probably like this one. (warning, spoiler)Some of the last minute bail outs when all looked hopeless are a little hokie...

B00821P3DS|2.0|They are trying to make this series into more than one thing, consequently it misses the mark on everything. I believe they thought if they tried to include something for everyone they would reach a broader (larger) audience. Result is mediocre on all fronts. I am skipping a lot of boring episodes.
0486474917|4.0|This book was purchased for high school reading which was required. It was a good price for the purpose intended.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|As well-written as the author's other novels.  But still enjoyed A Thousand Splendid Suns much more.  But a worthwhile read.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|Interesting characters.  Streaming works well but sound quality is not great.  We had trouble understanding some of the dialogue.  Still worth watching.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer does it again!  His sound track of the new Superman movie is both regal and majestic!  Superman after all is the Leader and flagship for DC Universe.  The individual sound track has similar repetitive themes, but in its own way is different.  I would compare this album to Hans earlier work on Gladiator.  If you are a fan of Superman or Hans Zimmer, this is a must buy!
B00BKU9ZFU|4.0|Am definitely a fan of Ms. Salvant's, just not a huge fan of the CD song choices. St. Louis Woman and John Henry are my favorites.
B00CTERB2A|5.0|I have been watching this series with my 13 year old son. We love it! Its a great show that we enjoy wAtching together.
0307887448|5.0|This book is by far the best book I've read in a while and is now my favorite! This book keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what's about to happen next. Honestly, at first I thought it was going to alright, but I sure was wrong. (to keep it short and sweet) I HIGHLY recommend this book! READ READY PLAYER ONE!!!!
1433537419|5.0|I love the way this Bible feels in my hands as I study.  I am very happy with this purchase, I believe I will read more often.
140006922X|4.0|Reza Aslan has provided a very well written summary of the conclusions from modern historical research on Jesus. While skeptical about orthodox Christian claims about Christian doctrines of Jesus's divinity or of the Trinity, Aslan is not anti-religion, voicing little skepticism, for example, over Jesus's healings and \\"works of wonder.\\" Part 1 describes the context of Palestine during Jesus's time--with people politically oppressed by Rome in partnership with the elite Jewish leaders of Jerusalem and its Temple. Part 2 describes Jesus as a peasant political revolutionary who sought to be a messianic (but human) king over Israel on behalf of the poor and oppressed. Part 3 provides an explanation for how this political figure became the the divine Christ, mostly because the Hellenized Jewish followers of Jesus, led by Paul, broke from the Hebrew and Jerusalem-based followers of Jesus led by James, Jesus's brother, who faded from power after James is executed in 62 AD and Jerusalem is destroyed by the Romans in 70. My main criticism is that Aslan did not spend enough time explaining what was so unique about Jesus and his teachings that caused for there to be so many passionate followers whose connection to their leader only increased after his execution. Still, this is a fascinating and provocative book that popularizes much that usually remains in academic circles.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Think funnier than Twilight! Farce on Romeo and Juliet with zombies... And action packed cuteness... Yep this movie has it all. Much better than I expected!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I really enjoyed not seeing Dredd take his helmet off and how he was portrayed in this film as if he came directly from the comics.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  My grandaughter who had seen the musical with me on broadway the previous day, felt it deviated from the book more than the show and that parts of it were more frightening to her.
B00DURILJ2|5.0|I have never been a fan of Matthew McConaughey, but perhaps I have never seen him cast in the perfect role. This movie made me care about every character which is a feat in itself. I would describe watching this movie like reading a great book. The acting is top notch and the cinematography is captivating. I recommend a buy not a rental for this one.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|didn't work and kept telling me to redownload and closed out. but it could be reopened and I'd be right back where I was.  so through brute force (and multiple reloads) I was able to make some progress.. downloaded it from a different store.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie - funny, entertaining, cute movie for the family to enjoy over and over. Why do you have to write such a long review?
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Not as good as I expected it to be, a little disappointed with the language, but otherwise it was a nice movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love these Jewels games!  Recommend to all.<br />If you love three in a row games, these are for you.<br />Teriffic!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Opening video plays, but then hangs on \\"loading\\" and game never starts.  Contacted Gameloft about the problem and still no update. Can't play a game that never loads. Too bad, this looked like it could be fun.<br /><br />UPDATE: The app has been updated, and now I can finally play it! It's kinda like Subway Surfers / Temple Run - in that style but with the fun of minions and bananas. I don't like the portions where it suddenly goes into side view because the switching interferes with gameplay, and the tilt functions are not very responsive. Overall, a fun running game but not something I play a lot.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|GF's nephew LOVED these! They are very sturdy and great additions to any set of toys! Might have to scoop some up for myself as they are gorgeous toys.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Downloaded this to our kindles and my kids love it, they create and expand their areas the only problem I have with it, is the updates lack with it comes to Kindle updates and there is no Wii version either. But very entertaining and graphics are very good
B00499NHLC|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are fantastic as Holmes and Watson.  Excellent acting, stunning cinematography, captivating plot lines.  An excellent adaptation of these classic tales.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun book! Loved it! Would definitely recommend to friends to read! Can't wait to read her next books!! I am starting a, new one tonight.
B00CS9987W|5.0|This blu-ray is pretty good for a movie 50 years old. In the beginning of the movie there is a slight correction of the camara focus as Tippi crosses the street heading towards the store, but aside from that the transfer is pretty good. This is an excellant movie. After all these years scary.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a great book by a renowned scholar of theology. The Faux &#34;News&#34; lies re Aslan not mentioning his Muslim (Iranian) background are put to rest by simply reading the forward ( Author's Note). Your beliefs regarding and interest in Jesus Christ probably fall somewhere on the spectrum from blind faith in the gospel accounts to the factual life of the historical Jesus. If the former, stick to the bible and the various apologists who followed it. If the latter, read this book. Aslan's research is impeccable and his conclusions well supported by all of the available evidence.
B000MGATTE|5.0|I haven't read Stephen King for a long time because his stories had gotten too creepy for me. Then recently I read &#34;Under the Dome&#34; and really liked it. So I thought I would try &#34;Lisey's Story&#34;. I think it was very well written and everything tied together. It jumps from one time to another while Lisey was remembering everything but was easy to follow. Being able to save her husband and her sister Amanda brought continuity to the story. She couldn't save Scott in the end but could save her own sanity. Very creative SK. I recommend this book.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl did a great job of giving a beginner many tips.  It sure showed that REI didn't have all the answers.  As a hiker of portions of the AT we did lots of reading and gave it great thought which I wish Cheryl had done first.  We were first taking our two girls (5 and 7) so of course we had to be extra careful.  We have never been sorry about the experience we gave ourselves and them.  They have spread this on to their children and hopefully they will carry it on to our great-grandchildren.  At this writing I have read 71% of the book and I cannot put it down.  I got this as a book club member and am anxious to hear how others feel, August 27th.  I have heard of other people taking up running while going through a personal problem but this is the first book I have read on hiking such a large undertaking.  Good for Cheryl ! !
B003O86FMW|5.0|The moment I rested my eyes in this book, I entered a world impossible to part with. That book became a part of me, I simply could not put it down! All the characters in this book show extreme sense of personality, and I love it. I can follow along easily with Catching Fire, yet still have no clue about what events might take place next. I have read Catching Fire no less than thrice, and I guarantee I will again. Suzanne Collins shows a very interesting story that touched my heart yet brought out wonder if such a turned around world, and may the odds be ever in her favor!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love period pieces anyway...however I thoroughly enjoyed the wholesomeness of the entire series. The acting was excellent by all! Well cast, scripted with pure dry humor!
1594481717|5.0|The book is filled with practical suggustions of exercise to develop the &#34;other&#34; side of our minds.  This book is a must read for adolescents and young adults.
B00871C09S|5.0|The best film in his library of great films. Only Hitchcock could make this brillant film. A must for classic movie fans.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was really funny and I guess they have out Red 2.  I love Bruce Willis anyway, and Morgan Freeman

B00499QUK2|5.0|The only Sherlock I've ever ever liked is the one that stars Jeremy Brett on the BBC...Brett was born to play the part of Sherlock and the program was done so very well --detail wise. I love watching those episodes over and over again. Time travel--almost.<br /><br />I've heard of a few other Sherlock takes (Robert Downey Jr.'s version and the one series where Watson is a girl--??!?? Stupid) I wouldn't waste my time on them. So, I really didn't hold out much hope for yet another attempt to modernize this classic. I really thought I would hate it.<br /><br />But, like Bret, Cumberbach (sp?) was born for this part. He is an amazing Sherlock. And his Watson is just as great--a perfect pairing. Their banter and humor and yin/yang of their relationship: superb. (It's SO strange to me to walk down the aisle at the video store and see Watson dressed up like a Hobbit...weird.) And the way this series stays so loyal to the original stories, yet places them in a modern time and context...nothing short of genius. And I must say, I am not easily impressed at all. A Sherlock snob if you will. I cannot get enough of this series and I'm SO grateful to be able to watch it at my leisure on Amazon Prime (though I've been hinting and hinting that I want both seasons on DVD...nothing yet). Just one more reason to love love LOVE Amazon.
B00013RC8O|5.0|I ordered this as a birthday gift for one of my sons.  It is one of my four or five all time favorite movies and I'm sure that he will love it just as I do.  Excellent product at an excellent price.
B004X75RCW|1.0|Usually like Sandra Bullock. This plot and language did not live up to what we expected!  Will not order another movie just because she is in it.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I ordered this as a birthday gift for one of my sons.  My whole family absolutely loves this show and our son was thrilled.  Once again.....great product at a great price.......
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Enjoy the way history is untwined with the story line.  So much different than tired story lines of other TV.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Slow build up, but definitely worth it by the end. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a great fantasy epic.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I have been sitting here for awhile trying to make it work. Every video I want to watch it says &quot;vtube stopped&quot;. I just want an app that actually works for watching you tube videos. Don't get it. Even though it is free.
B00000DHRX|5.0|I've had this DVD for a while and wanted to buy it for a friend. She has always liked it and I wanted to lighten up her day.<br /><br />This is great DVD that catalogs a brilliant career.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I didn't have any expectations for this movie, because I had heard mixed reviews.<br />It was actually really cute. The first time I watched it with adults only, because I wasn't sure about it's content. Later I watched it with my 3 yr old, because it's not even as scary as the original Wizard of Oz. This seemed to be the story of what happened before Dorothy visited oz, like how the wizard came to be.
B008NABUU8|4.0|this game is very fun and accurately uses physics to describe what happens to the bridge. the exploding tanker is a nice touch.
B003DNN0L2|2.0|We thought this was okay to watch with our 3 yr old, but it was kind of inappropriate. She kept asking questions about the movie that we couldn't really answer. We had heard from friends that this was good, but not so much. It was one of the most bizarre things we've ever watched.
1846573785|1.0|I first attempted to read the book, but it didn't hold my attention. I later listened to the audiobook. Becca sounds like nails on a chalkboard. She's like a whiny 15 year old cheerleader.<br /><br />Twilight, I mean Fifty Shades of Grey, is weak and unimaginative. Hardly worth the attention or fame it's received.
0547848412|5.0|We read this in my Book Club and we all loved it. Even if you've seen the movie (which is also good), this is a great read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love Downton Abbey! So glad that it is on here! Would highly recommend watching this show! All the characters are wonderful.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|GOOD game if your looking for a strategy game.<br />Descent graphics but takes a while to build up army and coins
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Sad characters, sad plot. Glad that I don't live in that time in that place. Especially as a woman. Yikes. Heathcliff may be the most despicable character I have ever encountered and both Catherines sound like royal bitches. Edgar , Hareton and Nelly are sympathetic and Isabella as well. Linton sounds like a brat. Challenging read, strong prose.

1401940676|5.0|A really wonderful book that my brother, after having read it himself, suggested that I read. I bought it on CD and it was nice hearing the story in Anita's voice. Our Mother past away last May and it was very comforting to hear Anita describe how wonderful it was when she had her near death experience. It sounds like my Mom's in a purely exceptional place! THANK YOU for writing the book Anita and sharing your amazing story. THANK YOU to Wayne Dyer, also, who is a great inspiration. My mom first read Erroneous Zones around 30 years ago, gotten at a garage sale by her for $.25 that she described as changing her life.<br /><br />Keep writing books!

B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Interesting game but the commercials in the free version are really obnoxious.  I'll play it awhile but don't think I will stay with it long enough to justify paying for the non-ad version.

0141439734|5.0|Fast delivery and almost brand new.  My child is reading this book as part of her summer reading, and I appreciates the discount from Barnes and Nobels.  It is almost  50% off the the list price and I don't mind the wait for delivery rather than getting it from the book stoer.
B006S086AM|2.0|This movie is not Superbad even though it tries to be. The characters aren't all that engaging and I just didn't care enough about them or the story line to slog through the slow parts.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the way the series was wrapped up.  Just enough without seeming to phony.  Truly enjoyed this series along with every other women who's read it!
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|love the game fun...challenging but not impossible want more puzzle packs though love the game really like it a lot
B003O86FMW|5.0|Same thrill as the first book but with lots of new twists.  Excited to read how the trilogy ends.  Great concept for a story.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the plot, love the aliens, love the characters and love the production. If you loved V, you will love this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game and it really takes up time like your playing for 2 minutes it's really 5 minutes
B007AJFSJW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book (disclaimer I am in the 'saltwater' economic camp myself).  I thought it provided an excellent overview for the lay person of modern macro economic ideas out there and also backed up, with justification, the economic course Paul espouses.  It will be a good read even after our current economic conditions change, maybe even better, as we reflect on what could have been.  I will recommend this to anyone who wants to understand how macroeconomics and modern economies actually work.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I don't like it it doesn't help at all, so don't get it unless u need help with the game
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|How can you offer a cheat sheet but not offer the actual game? You are wasting my time with this nonsense!
0316113506|5.0|I was already a fan of Ratey's and this book confirms why I should keep buying his works.<br /><br />I'm studying psychology but you don't need to do so to understand his concepts. Very good purchase and even a better book!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Pumped full of shoot 'em up action with a great plot to keep you hooked onto every word. A great read for anyone.
B008JFUR10|2.0|Would someone keep these mastermind directors away from Skywalker Ranch?  M. Night Shyamalan, Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg, and now Del Toro have fallen to the Lucas syndrome.  I used to compare Transformers to Pans Labyrinth, in the difference between foreign film and US pop.  In some ways this film looks sharper than Transformers, has better atmosphere, but it's just a knockoff of Independence Day's plot (and even characters) with robots.  A \\"shark attack\\" in the beginning of a film is important, but you don't reveal the whole monster!  Remember Jaws with the fin, and the girl getting pulled under water?  The audience only needs a taste to appreciate what comes later.  Even Independence Day and Transformers got this point right...
B000U6BT40|4.0|Starts off a little slow, more on character intro then on story line.<br />Then the ideas start to roll, taking theory and making actuality, borders on &#34;how could that possibly be&#34; but putting disbelief on hold presents a thorughly enjoyable story.<br />The not so smart sheriff who uses whats around him, without really understanding what makes it work, to solve the mysteries that happen every episode.
B008M721MS|5.0|It is very good you should make Facebook Skype is Tasha Perkins MY brother is Kingston my mother is giving me a wizard and I won't be doing stuff that cd and
B008RC72G8|5.0|We loved this movie with Johnny Depp along with all the other movies he is in. It has great comedy & follows the original series in a new kind of way that does make this very enjoyable.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The minions really help make story. Worth the time to watch more than once. Really a good flick. Watch it.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This is an action packed movie that was really fun to watch. It is a must have to go along with Iron Man & The Avengers movies.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Those that claim being of any faith but Christianity disqualifies someone from writing about Jesus have it completely wrong. In fact, if you are Christian, doesn't that mean you already have a built-in bias? How many avowed Christians will question the evidence that goes against their own faith's teachings?<br /><br />If you don't have a bone in the fight, maybe what comes out is that much more relevant and believable. Perhaps the \\"zealots\\" who place one-star reviews without reading the book should realize exactly what it means to have tunnel vision.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Ted is a very funny movie better than i expected this movie is underrated its easy 5 stars not sure why its less because if you know your movies and like the hangover and the sitter then youll like this and if you dont then your not a movie person or your just a boring person and have no sense of humor humer lol
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy the challenge this game provides, but would like more levels. Can't wait to see what thd next levels employ. Hope it stays as good. Don't like being forced to rate. .
B000SW4DH6|4.0|Its not the best musical but if you like musical movies youll like this movie just dont expect it to be like hairspray or mamma mia you might want to rent it first before you buy so thats why i only gave this 4 stars
B000U6BT40|5.0|Our entire family loves this show!  It's funny and thought provoking - definitely worth a try.  We've been through all 5 seasons - time to circle back.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am a big fan of the post-apocalypse genre, but for some reason the previews for this show didn't excite me.  Since it was only one available through Amazon Prime, though, I decided to watch it was really pleasantly surprised.  The plot is original, even if the concept is not, the action moves refreshingly quickly, the characters are very likeable, the dialogue feels authentic - they just generally did a good job with this one.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I didn't watch The Good Wife when it first came out, because the promo's made it look as if the lead character was a goody goody helpless victim.  The show is actually well done with lots of family dynamics, courtroom twists and turns,  and workplace intrigue. And Alicia, &#34;the good wife&#34;, is anything but the helpless victim.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Hard to review something that will not open. I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchased. How do I get my money back?
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I just discovered this series and watched them all in one weekend - sooooo good! I wish there were more!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I do not intend to use this app on my Kindle as I would use Office on my laptop. My intent is to view documents, spreadsheets and presentation files mostly, but probably make minor editing. So far, it serves all my needs.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I used to play this on Facebook and when I saw they were adding a new platform I decided to try it out. So far so good.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|when I was playing I swiped down and it took my g coins away I had 52 now I have 2. so mad
140006922X|1.0|Wow - talk about deception - the author, who is a devout muslim, attempts to hijack the historical Jesus and make him over as he is portrayed in Islam... The author is deceptive, and a liar. He portrays to be a historical authority, yet he is just a muslim. Now, he is authorized his viewpoint, but he should speak for a position of truth. Islam has been at war with Christianity since it's inception 1400 years ago, and will continue to be. It isn't a great book, or a great insight into Jesus the man - it is muslim ideology.
B00DURILJ2|4.0|This was a very compelling thriller! Kept you on the edge of your seat and it was hard to tell who was good or bad! I love movies that keep you involved and wondering until the very end! Surprises all the way to the end! Matthew is taking on more serious, thrilling,and deep roles! He's growing as an actor for the best! Oscar is in his near future!!!
B00AX6KNOY|3.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It hits all the tropes and cliches, but never bogs down. Performances were decent. Almost went 4 stars, but it IS just another teen horror movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really had a hard time taking a break from this book. I wanted to stay and read every word so as not to miss a thing. Stephen thank you for writing and sharing with us once again.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|After reading reviews on Amazon for a multitude of car chargers, I landed on this item.  My goal was to keep my iPhone 4S charged while using GPS on a road trip and to keep charge on the iPad 3 in the back seat to keep the kids entertained.  This charger did both very well. It actually charges my iPhone faster than any other charger I own, including the chargers that came with both my iPhone and iPad. The product feels well constructed, makes good connection in the car and doesn't stick out far from the dash.  Would purchase again in a heartbeat!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|We loved this game on our XBOX and the mobile version is just as fun. Thankfully PopCap left out the zen garden which I hated in the original game anyway. I really enjoy the vase breaking levels and I wish they and included more of that in the mobile version. Overall the mobile version is true to the original and it is so great to be able to take it with me. This gave me hours of entertainment when I had dead time to kill!
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Too wierd and wild for me.  I'm not into poultergeists stuff.  I haven't finished the book yet, maybe thiings will improve.  A most unusual 7 year old boy, perhaps he should get his head out of books and see and learn about the real natural world, use his body  physically and often as 7 year old boys often do
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Didn't love Gone Girl but decided to give Sharp Objects a try and was pleasantly surprised. Kept my attention the whole way and made me more intrigued as the story went on.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|action packed from start to finish loved the bruce willis cameo, better than the first movie in my opinion. if you like a full on action flick you won't be disappointed
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Charges two devices at once.  Amazing long lasting battery.  Very fast charging iPhones.  Small footprint.  Great for the use as a flashlight.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Very well written, as is all of Gaiman's stuff.<br />Nicely built universe with just enough magic and mystery.<br />Good plot with interesting twists and turns.<br />A little bit on the short side.<br /><br />And as my title says, it's really more on the level of Coraline or Graveyard book. Interesting for adults, but still more on a young adult or pre teen level.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I rated this book 5 stars because it is one of the most amazing books I have read. Though it was a summer reading book it didn't feel as that. I'm a middle school going to the 7th grade and I could really relate to this book. I suggest that you get this book if you have ever been treated wrong in school for something you couldn't control. Also I think u should just read this book if u really do just love to read a good book.  -Makayla B.
B003RUX2VE|4.0|Title says it all.  I am a Chris Evans fan, which, is why I wanted to watch it.  Figured if Captain America was so good, then his earlier stuff may be entertaining also.  Originally saw him in Not Another Teen Movie and laughed until I cried, to see him in action roles was a nice change.  The plot of this movie is kind of far-fetched, the gratuitous body-shot of Evans in this movie and in Captain America was worth my seven bucks.  Ha.  But, definitely would not consider this a must-see for any other reasons, really!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Very pleased with Magic 2014. You will spend hours upon hours playing it. It's the best magic yet, outside of magic online!
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Liked, not loved this movie.  Enjoyed, but I think once is enough.  Typical formula for a chick-flick-comedy.  C'mon, Cameron Diaz doesn't even get fat, the labor/delivery scenes were cheesy and the stepmom is annoying, but suddenly becomes Ms Delegate and fixes her husband's bad father-son relationship?  She doesn't get fat, either.  Her character is supposed to be irritatingly perfect and the audience is supposed to be satisfied with her twins being terrors after a perfect L/D scene where she sneezes the kids out.  Please.  I would watch this again if I didn't have anything else to do only because I really like Elizabeth Banks, of course, she is the only character who we are *supposed* to like because she is so perfectly flawed!  Not really enough for me to buy the DVD and make a point to watch it again.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Although quite like jungle run, the game is fun and annoyingly addictive. Good fun for all ages. Would recommend it.
B000065V42|4.0|my grandson wanted to see this, so I bought it for him. he already had it, but has watched this one at our house.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Great couple's movie. It has action/drama/science fiction/romance. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Just buy it, you'll love it. :)
B00003CXWV|5.0|this movie is easily my favorite. Johnny Depp is so good in it and as well as the other actors/actresses. The story line of this movie is the only one in my life that has had my emotions flowing that deeply from laughing and smiling to the verge of tears. i love it
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved. This installment it kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to the end. I couldn't put it down. I forgotten bow good this one was.
B001NAT05W|2.0|This movie had star quality and potential and got bogged down in its own camp and ridiculous mythology... this is a B- at best.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a real challenge.  Puzzles, logic, and streaming thought are illnesses play this game. I play this in bed every morning, to get my brain started. LOVE IT!!!!
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|This is unquestionably one of the better seasons of TNG; in all honesty, most fans would probably have a hard time choosing between this and Season 3.  Plenty of standout episodes, including \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part II\\", \\"Family\\", \\"Reunion\\", \\"The Drumhead\\", \\"Redemption, Part I\\" and many more.  The good episodes clearly outweigh anything resembling \\"below average\\", and there's nothing here that's as bad as some of the most offensive outings from TNG's first two years.<br /><br />As expected, this Blu-ray is another winner. The A/V quality is again top notch, with all of the live action footage again being rescanned, cut and remastered by CBS Digital.  The clarity on display here is simply astounding, as you probably already know if you've seen earlier seasons of TNG on Blu-ray.  New CGI and effects shots were handled by Modern VideoFilm, who have done a very good job in ensuring that the quality is nearly as good as Seasons 1 and 3.  Though a few shots stand out for the wrong reasons, it's still a quality effort considering the deadlines involved.  I'd imagine that most fans, again, will be enormously pleased with the results.  The audio is also fantastic, and it's available in 7.1 and the original 2.0 stereo.<br /><br />As far as extras go, there are some good ones here, but overall it's a small step down from the ones we got with Season 3.  These include a two-part documentary, a chat with the TNG art department, several deleted scenes, a gag reel, old Archive Mission Logs, the original episode promos and more.  Though yes, these TNG seasons are priced very high, they're definitely worth the extra cash.  A lot of love went into this release and it shows.<br /><br />For more information please read my full review at DVD Talk, which is not affiliated with Amazon.  [...]

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I've been an Eagle fan from the very beginning, purchasing their debut album when I was still in high school, and literally wearing out my cassette.  I own every CD and DVD they have released.  I thought this was one of the best rock documentaries ever produced, and certainly the most honest and objective.  Even as a hard core Eagles fan, there was much information here that I had not heard or read before....and they did an excellent job of interspersing their catalogue of songs between the interviews and other aspects of the documentary.  Great to see Jerry Brown, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and JD Souther all offering their perspective in interview snippets.  And though the POV and narrative of Glen Frey and Don Henley dominate-- as it should-- all the other band members (Meisner, Leadon, Felder, Walsh, Schmidt) got to offer their 2-cents worth, and provide their own personal perspective on what transpired.  In the case of Randy and Bernie, it was clear that time had simply run it's course, and each was ready to move on for personal reasons.  As for Don Felder,  based on his final interview snippet on Disc 2 of the documentary, one has to believe he truly regrets his attempt at a power play (which he had to know there was no way he was going to win).<br /><br />As for the bonus disc of the 1977 live concert, one can only express disappointment in not getting the entire performance.  Having said that, the audio and visual clarity of those 8-songs included was exceptional (as one would expect of anything released by Frey and Henley).  I can hope that at some point in the the not so distant future they go into their archives and release a concert DVD of an early concert performance with the original roster.  With Bernie touring with the band this Summer, perhaps they can release it as a companion disc with a DVD of the current tour.

B009NQZVKG|3.0|The Eye of God by James Rollins is the latest of the Sigma series and left me wondering what happened to Kowalski's incredible dialogue?  He is my favorite character because he has, or had, such a great mouth.  In this story he was just sort of normal and so were all the other super heroes.  Just because they were great in the other books doesn't mean if they show up in a story, they can get away with being normal guys.  And how come no mythic monsters? At least Kowalski remembered about the Grendals even if the author seems to have forgotten.  Even the bad guys had a normal feel.  The Korean jerk was pretty ugly, but the threat level just didn't feel the same.  The Amazing characters of the Sigma series need to go back to being amazing or the author needs to let the new guys like Duncan, with his magnetic fingers take the lead.  I liked this story and it was well done, but I have come to expect more than that from an author, who has over the years spoiled me rotten, by always amazing me instead of just entertaining me.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think you should get it because it is a good time consuming game. but it needs to get the updates faster.

B0086213XW|4.0|It was a touching movie and unexpected. A little slow but very moving. I highly recommend it to any married couple.
B00CHRB9RM|3.0|Disappointing.  Mistakenly believed the last 2 discs were concert footage rather than audio only.  Not all that great a performance by the band.  Not worth the $
B007THA4FI|4.0|While this book was not without its faults, I did enjoy it. It takes a while to get into, since there are more than a dozen main characters and you have to get to know them well enough to tell them all apart. Once that is accomplished, you can sit back and enjoy the wealth of social issues Rowling addresses. The characters are realistic and relatable, and though the overall feel of the book is one of pessimism of negativity, it has its moments of warmth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is an adorable game and is perfact for dispicable me fans. It is fun and hilarious. I think that it is great for any one.
030758836X|3.0|If you simply want great writing with a brilliant plot, this book deserves the cumulative forty thousand stars it's been given. Gillian Flynn is a master wordsmith; the phrases she turns are visionary and always fresh. This is four hundred pages packed with truly clever and poetic verbal virtuosity. The back-and-forth diaries are compelling.<br /><br />At the same time, the book is needlessly and relentlessly vulgar. Every kind of low and depressing sexual act is described; \\"F words\\" and worse abound in ways that are, yes, descriptive, but oh so unnecessary. (Distressing, because the writer's bio picture makes you think of someone you'd sit next to at church!) On top of this, the entire saga is completely amoral. The two lead characters have nothing about them that we can admire or even feel sympathy for. The final plot twists are not satisfying at all, with an ending that is abrupt and emotionally baffling, not to mention ludicrous.<br /><br />This is a tour de force in describing total depravity and narcissistic dysfunction; for that, the five stars are an accurate gauge. But I can't help but think that some redemption could make Ms. Flynn's writing so much more powerful and enriching to a world that needs ennobling literature.
B002S9DRA6|4.0|I am enjoying listening to the collection. In one of my moves I lost her c.d.s....so wonderful to have her back in my house again. I'll be sure she doesn't get lost again.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A brilliant ending to a clever series which leaves enough strings untied at the end to justify a novel or two set in the fourth age.  If the fact that Mr Jordan himself  didn't write every line of the last novel is keeping you from reading kitchen you're missing out.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|David Balducci excels at the page turner, and I always enjoy his novels.  I had read the sequel prior to reading this book, so I was very curious about Will Robie, and how he got to where he was.  I would have preferred more character development, but I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, and had trouble putting it down.  I'd give it a 4 1/2 but I'd recommend it to anyone who likes suspenseful spy dramas.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|Very solid sudoku app with a variety of difficulties and options to customize your game experience.  Unfortunately, I personally am no good at digital sudoku and require pencil and paper.  There's just something about having to click to erase that makes me forget what I was doing.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|Every once in a while, you come across a book that shatters your expectations and achieves status as one of your top 5 books of all time. For me, that book is Slammed. There are so many thoughts running through my head right now that I'm not sure if I can even organize them into a coherent review, but I'm going to try. So, I have to let it be known upfront, I LOVE this book! Love, love, love...okay, I'm sure you get the point. This stunning book has everything I love about a book, such as an emotional plot, a love interest that's worth swooning over, romance, great writing, and above all else, an engaging main character.<br /><br />Let's start off with the main character, Lake. From the first few pages, I was hooked. To have so many emotions at the VERY start of a book is rare for me. Most of this could probably be attributed to the riveting writing, but I think a lot of credit needs to go to Lake. She's a believable 18 year old girl. She's smart, witty, and is extremely family oriented. Unlike most YA/NA books, this book is about more than her falling in love with some guy. It's about her reconnecting with her family after a terrible tragedy. You get to know her mother and brother and actually come to love them as well. Even though she is handed a rough situation, she deals with it in a rational way. She may at first act a little immature about it, but it's plausible to how any 18 year old would handle such loss and responsibility.<br /><br />Now, on to THE guy, Will. Okay, I have to say it, Will totally beat out any other love interest from any other book I've ever read. He's smart, passionate, poetic (got to love that slam poetry), responsible, and just a genuine good guy. Perfect, actually. He may damn well be my idea of THE perfect man. And the romance between these two is just unbelievably good. The author nailed the instant connection but built on it in such a way that it didn't even remotely feel like a case of insta-love to me. They fall for each other for the right reasons, instead of the typical, shallow YA/NA romances where all the main character can do is swoon over her guy's looks. Will is completely different and was a refreshing change from the bad boys that dominate most books. And again, that damn slam poetry was just insane. I thought that would just be the whole focus of the book, but it works perfectly with the plot and characters. When it is used, it's powerful and I loved that.<br /><br />\\"He presses his forehead against mine and slides his hands down my arms. Our eyes lock when we open them. It's during this moment that I finally understand why my mother accepted her fate at the age of eighteen.\\"<br />Hoover, Colleen (2012-01-01). Slammed (Kindle Locations 2168-2172).<br /><br />The writing in this book was intense. The emotional attachment you attain with each of the characters is rare, at least for me. Usually, there are some characters that I could do without but not this book. I don't think I have ever laughed, squealed, or cried so much before because of a book. To get so into it that I feel like it's happening to me is just exciting. From Kel's random funny bits, to the ongoing \\"Chuck Norris\\" comments, to the words of wisdom from Lake's mom, I was just delighted.<br /><br />\\"There are hurricanes,\\" I say. \\"You forgot about the little area known as The Gulf of Mexico. But there aren't any tornadoes.\\" They both pause. \\"There are definitely tornadoes,\\" Gavin says. \\"No,\\" I say. \\"There's no such thing as tornadoes, Gavin. Chuck Norris just hates trailer parks.\\"<br />Hoover, Colleen (2012-01-01). Slammed (Kindle Locations 5714-5728).<br /><br />The plot was amazing. I felt moved after reading this book. I can't really say much of what happened because it would spoil it. In fact, I would be careful of reading reviews for this book at all, because I think what made this book all the more of a shock to me was that I didn't really know anything about it. I had seen it about a year ago on Amazon and just tooka chance on it based off the small blurb I read. It has been in my TBR list for quite awhile and I finally got around to reading it. Best. Book. Decision. EVER.<br /><br />\\"Well, you would realize... Like I eventually realized... That all the good things about her? All the beautiful? It's not real. It's fake.  So you keep your ocean, I'll take the Lake.\\"<br />Hoover, Colleen (2012-01-01). Slammed (Kindle Locations 9301-9318).<br /><br />Now, to the craziest part. I have nothing that I would change about this book. No sentence, character, plotline, or ending needed altered. It was perfect. The ending tied things up nicely while still leaving me wanting more. This review has turned into a bit of a gush fest, but it was highly deserved. I would recommend this book to anyone. I'm serious. If you love romance, great writing, or just want to read something that makes you feel, then this is the book for youa chance on it based off the small blurb I read. It has been in my TBR list for quite awhile and I finally got around to reading it. Best. Book. Decision. EVER.<br /><br />\\"Well, you would realize... Like I eventually realized...

I would recommend this book to anyone. I'm serious. If you love romance, great writing, or just want to read something that makes you feel, then this is the book for you
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun, addictive, and entertaining. Easy to get going and to get hooked. Some ads and some push to buy, but it's not required.
B004HXIZVC|4.0|I like sound while reading or listening to a book.  So far that's all I've tried it on so still have to see if its good when downloading movies and such.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Blah de blah blah... I would avoid this movie like the plague... Weak plot and tired acting all around. No visual effects can make up for such drivel. Watch Memento instead.

B00AEFXKOO|5.0|Great movie to have on Blu-Ray.  Picture quality is awesome and the extras on the disc are worth it as well.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|Our family really enjoyed the series but the disk kept skipping through the third episode which was very frustrating. I would highly recommend this to all who are interested in historical movies!

B0031RS4V6|5.0|This is another great Jack Reacher novel by Lee Child, if only there were a lot more men like Jack Reacher!
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|It is an okay game...maybe I just don't do very well at it...considering it was a free app at the time...it was worth the try... you may enjoy the game...as for me I rarely play it anymore.
0375869026|5.0|This story was so compelling I couldn't put it down. It was as if I was Auggie. He showed more bravery than I have in my whole life.<br />It helped teach me about compassion & love. A whole different level than what I thought I possessed.<br />We will be discussing it in adult Sunday School in Aug. I'm sure this will be a very emotional class.<br />Thanks to R.J. Palacio for writing this book, I have suggested it to a lot of people.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I like the type of games that challenge you...this one certainly does...starts out easy and gets progressively harder...think you'll like it too.

B007A2O3FO|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  I loved the Old house and furnishings. The costumes were very nice. It was fun to go back in time and meet nice ghosts.<br />Wish the Dad could have made it. It would be nice to see the family go on living in the manson.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|did not like how long it took to figure out how to play this game. I own Cubis  and Cubis Gold. Not even having that experience was it easy to figure out this game. Sadly once I did, I found it boring, uneventful or challenging. Waste of $ and time.
B0000508U6|3.0|I like Coldplay but I did  not like this CD as well as others.  I especially like Viva La Vida.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Honestly I do not remember buying this game. If I did I probably had trouble down loading it like I did other purchases. My tablet is in repair. I will hopefully look this up.
B00821OX98|4.0|The series starts out extremely slow IMO but it progresses into a very interesting, entertaining, and surprisingly exciting story. I would definitely recommend this series to someone who is interested in sci-fi and Aliens
0142424277|1.0|Despite this having been recommended by more than one Objectivist friend, I cannot like this story. I have no problem with Dahl's evil characters, who are evil in the normal way (by turns lazy, lying, and violent). My problem is with his \\"good\\" characters, who I divide into two basic types. One type is the passive innocent bewildered by evil (Charlie and his grandfather in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Miss Honey in Matilda). Another type is Willy Wonka or Matilda herself, both cunning magicians who delight in Vengeance (as opposed to Justice), using trickery and malice to make the villains temporarily miserable. Ultimately the villains abscond from the immediate neighborhood, but no justice is done and there is no hint that justice even exists, anywhere.<br /><br />The Dahl universe is confined to a narrow prison in which there is a bully, a passive innocent, and Magic. Inexplicably, neither Matilda nor Miss Honey can call the police or act in any way to stop the violent Miss Trunchbull. Dahl presents (again and again, in each new novel) a universe in which there is no alternative but suffering, until somehow, magically the suffering stops. This is the essense of child abuse. Why would anyone want to recreate that essence in a children's story? To make real abused children feel better? What such children need is not an accurate portrayal of the hell they're already in, but confirmation that suffering is NOT NORMAL, that bullies are evil, that somewhere there are people who are just and benevolent and that someday they will actually help you.<br /><br />Dahl's moral universe provides none of these hopeful alternatives, only a detailed, bewildering array of magical, frightening situations. If a child is not already anxious and suffering from nightmares, exposure to Dahl's malevolent universe might be just the ticket!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was slow to get my attention at first, then got in the middle and lost it in the end.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|The Die Hard story should be allowed to pass on.  More special effects than story.  I would not watch it again
1878424319|5.0|I read this book several years ago - like a decade ago - and picked it up again recently because I am going through a break up and needed something stable to look forward to every night before I went to bed.  This book has helped me sleep and see life in a different way.  To say I am grateful for it would be an understatement.  I hope you can get out of it more than I did!
0062238868|5.0|This is Chris' words on his life and career in the Navy SEALs. I enjoyed it very much and it brought back a lot of memories about my own experiences in the miltary and the realtionships you develop while serving. RIP Chris and we're praying for your family.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Gasland and Gasland 2, I must say is at the very least is disheartening for those of us whom love life and the land we live in. Growing up in the state of Maine, I come from an  enviromentally aware family. Throughout my childhood,I am proud to say I helped my parents and many others save beautiful area's throughout the state from enviromental ruin from large industry that only saw dollar signs. It will be up to the people of each state to chip away at this gas monster ,Halliberton or Hellofaburden, (as I like to call them) to save as much land and water as possible. If we don't Our world will face a human induced apocalypse that will be 100 times scarier than watching \\"Gaslands\\". Unfortunately, the teapot has already tipped and the effects from envirometal warming can no longer be reversed. It's not a matter of if anymore , it's when. At the very least if we keep up with mass amounts of fracking, we will be in world wars over water for survival not energy.<br />  The reason why I say history repeats itself, is because when the government sold nuclear energy to the american public, we were told it will be so safe and inexpensive people will probalby not even get an electric bill . It will be great and the answer to all of our energy problems. Unfortunately the average person had no idea how nuclear power worked and we were never told that we would be storing used radioactive fuel rods in your back yard. It's taken the industry 50 + years to finally start recycling the used fuel rods as they now are stacked to capacity right outside the reactors..... As I said the line of bull fed to us now has been regurgitated in the past for other types of dangerous earth dooming energy sourses.  We've all been dooped... in the 2000's again with fracking. Wake up America! Thank you Josh Fox for illuminating and making us aware of the truth... I hope  there will be some changes to slow down the devestation to our beautiful planet... I now reside in North Carolina and fracking is set to start in 2014 in this beautiful state..  Lots of work to do.... Let's all lend a helping hand in preserving what we have left.
B003U51D58|2.0|The last season started ok and showed promise, the only reason I didn't give a 1-star rating.  To avoid giving away too much, I can only say the last episode was pathetic (well made but useless) as closure for the storyline(s).  I felt it wasted all the previous action and information in the need to make a final artsy &#34;final episode&#34;; you only end up with &#34;why.&#34;  If you are more enamored of cinematic style than storytelling, go ahead and watch, you may like it.
1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson has written a phenomenal book that is extremely hard to put down! I may be a little biased, being as I've been a Mac user since 1989. Not only do I work on a Mac, I also own an iPod, iPhone and iPad. As I said I may be a little biased.<br /><br />But anyway, this is Steve Jobs warts and all... a true genius with all his nasty, bizarre, sometimes crazy behavior. A seemingly unlovable person who was loved by many. Yet it's also a story of Apple, beginning in Jobs' adopted parents garage to its almost demise to becoming a world phenomenon. And then there was the amazing story of Pixar. Steve Jobs was a successful CEO of not one but 2 phenomenally successful companies. Steve Jobs was larger than life with a larger than life personality. A must read.
B0081336FO|5.0|This show is amazing. Love the cast, mystery woven in! Cumberbatch is a bad ass Sherlock!! Not much better on tv
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy to play.  A bit irritating to deal with the advertisement with every new deal, but that's the price for a free app.  Addictive.  Have recommended it to several friends.  Thanks
0321885112|5.0|I met Mike at an impromptu #CoffeeChat in Portland, Oregon while more than 3,000 people were visiting for the World Domination Summit (a conference conceived of by author and entrepreneur Chris Guillebeau). Mike and I are \\"social-network\\" connected through ANOTHER author and big-time thinker, a guy named Mike Vardy.<br /><br />During a quick conversation over a soy latte (me) and an espresso (Mike), I realized that I wanted to know more about what Mike Rohde does - so we decided to exchange books. (As an author, it's one way that I've been able to keep my book spending down...I offer to trade books with folks.)<br /><br />A week later, I got the \\"Video Edition\\" of The Sketchnote Handbook, and within 3 hours over a 2-day weekend I went through all 20 videos and read the book, cover to cover. To make things that much more \\"real,\\" I filled in 14 pages of what I'm calling \\"My First Sketchbook.\\"<br /><br />Why I'd STRONGLY recommend this book, and who'd I recommend it to...are you ready?<br /><br />1. If you are at all responsible for listening to, thinking about, managing and presenting information, you're going to want to go through this book. Get the video edition, and jump DIRECTLY to video #s<br /><br />  3: the Value of Sketchnoting<br />  5: Prepping for an Event<br />  9: Sketchnote from Start to Finish<br />  13: Drawing Simple Objects<br /><br />I can already say my \\"notes\\" are different; on the white board behind me here in my office, I've already drawn the \\"5 basic shapes\\" so that I can refer to them as I'm idea-ting.<br /><br />2. There's a three-step model I teach to \\"being productive;\\" and, I think Mike Rohde and I share a common philosophy. The way that I say it is a bit different (Focus, Ignore, Do) than Mike, but we both believe in the same end result. A series of tactics and specific tools make it easier to be open to the information available to us.<br /><br />As I was reading through the book, I also had the feeling that Mike was inspiring, not justeducating, me to want to get better. There, he introduced me to other authors, and showed his sketch notes of conferences that he'd attended. (Conferences that are now on my \\"to look at list\\" for next year.)<br /><br />Thank you, Mike, for delivering something we can use. You did good work.

B0090SI582|4.0|The superhero movies just keep rolling along and Stan Lee, in the later parts of his life is enjoying a financial windfall that didn't come in the early days when he was creating his famous characters. I'll have to be honest though, despite being a fan of superheroes, even I've grown tired of them. It isn't that I don't enjoy the movies, but it seems that it is the entirety of what Hollywood is putting out anymore. \\"The Wolverine\\" is another addition to the successful \\"X-Men\\" series. Personally, I find the X-Men to be one of Stan Lee's richest comic book series' due to the uniqueness of the characters and the more complicated stories that come with them.<br /><br />For some reason though, despite the richness of all the characters from the X-Men, it is only Logan, \\"The Wolverine\\", who was cool enough to get two solo-movies. While most of the X-Men fans salivate about the Wolverine, I find him to be less intriguing then some of the other characters. He's invincible. Every time he's wounded, he heals himself. I guess that's why I always found Batman more interesting than Superman as well.<br /><br />Fortunately though, the creators of \\"The Wolverine\\" tapped into the one thing that is Logan's weakness, his own mind and his immortal thoughts. This outing has Logan haunted by the death of Jean Gray, a death that happened in the terrible final \\"X-Men\\" trilogy movie, \\"Last Stand\\". His life as an immortal has become daunting and he has nothing to live for. So when a man from his past seeks him out, he travels to Japan to begin a new chapter in his long unending life.<br /><br />\\"The Wolverine\\" is certainly gifted with one thing that most of these superhero movies have seemed to be challenged to achieve. It has a relatively good and complicated story to tell. Another thing that is rewarding about the movie is the placement of events in Japan. The movie is drenched in Japanese culture, ninjas and traditions and I found it to be a fantastic mix with the troubled Wolverine and his retractable blades. Plus it took what we usually think a superhero movie to be and used some creativity in a new environment.<br /><br />\\"The Wolverine\\" isn't a great superhero movie but it is certainly one of the better ones and it gets the \\"X-Men\\" series back in line for, wait for it, more movies to come. In what has been a dismal summer of movies, it is sort of unfortunate to say that \\"The Wolverine\\" is probably one of the better movies thus far. It delivers emotion, relation to the characters, an involving story, a dramatic situation to be invested in and it finally delivers the big blockbuster action that the popcorn poppers come to see.his retractable blades.

B003K15IF8|5.0|By chance I read that Ian McEwan recently recommended this book and decided to try it, withouth knowing anything about the author.  After reading it I understood the reasons for it having been called \\"a perfect novel\\".  It is deeply moving yet without a trace of sentimentality.  A journey not in the realm of feelings but in the world of thoughts and inner life, and somehow still hugely intense.  When reading this novel about a seemingly common and unimpressive life, one feels a strange awareness and connection with the experience of being human.  Almost every paragraph is a small discovery in its soft elegance.  I agree with reviews I have found after finishing the book, which equate the re-emergence of this novel written many years ago with sort of a minor miracle.  Read it.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|If you like puzzles this one's for you. Was a great time passer. Good variety. Didn't get tired of one kind of puzzle. Would highly recommend.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Although the book sticks to its Afghan roots and themes, and it generally follows one set of characters - it's pieced-mealed into other little dramas that are woven into the main story, but it doesn't really work. I got bored and confused. When it was over, I was given a drawn-out conclusion on the brother and sister; but other characters that I first thought were important never really got fully developed or got to have a final purpose.  Where I felt &#34;Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; were truly important novels with something to say, it felt like &#34;And The Mountains Echoed&#34; was just a book Mr. Hosseini had to write to meet a contractual agreement.

140006922X|5.0|A tour-de-force. Hard to believe that people are bad mouthing this book, clearly not having read it. They would be surprised at how instructive this material is, and possibly feel much more connected with the humanity of a man who lived immersed in a social and religious context that is often hard to grasp. Much come to light in this book and what emerges is not a defiled Jesus of Nazareth, but a man much more like ourselves. Wasn't that one of the main tenants of his life on earth?

The third light showing that it's plugged into a USB 3 port is handy. The WiFi in her dorm is really bad, so this device has been a life saver and so far has worked flawlessly.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Ender's Game, Dune, Foundation, Stranger in a Strange Land, Brave New World... These are some of my all time favorites.  Wool is close.  Better than Maze Runner or Hunger Games, both of which I enjoyed immensely.  Wool is way, way up on the list.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great. One of very few original games nowadays. It is a sandbox game so it never gets old (if it does it's because you don't have a good imagination) you can build stuff, try to survive, make cool machines, pretty much anything. I have played Minecraft extensively on my pc so i was worried the pocket edition would bore me, but it didn't bore me for a second. The controls, after a few minutes of playing, are fairly intuitive (which can't be said for most tablet games). Overall a really great game.

B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|Enter the Dragon is THE greatest martial arts movie of all time.  The transfer to Bluray is incredible.  But, I would have liked to see some better work put in for the fans of Bruce Lee for so many years.  First, one of the most iconic moments on top Castle Peak where Bruce Lee is speaking with the monk, IT'S FREAKIN' DUBBED WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S VOICE!!! WTF!!! Why would you have a 40 year anniversary of the greatest martial arts icon of all time and have it dubbed with someone elses voice other than Bruce Lee?  It's just mind boggling.  I've seen that same exact scene elsewhere where it's Bruce Lee's own voice before, so why not here?  Second, for a retail price tag of $50 (it's $35 here on Amazon), I expect the likes of a steel case, a bobble figure of Bruce Lee, much more extras and commentary from the old cast.  The Bluray case itself is made from recycled material.  I know it's great to be green and help the environment, but come on, they could have done better for Bruce Lee and Bruce Lee fans.  Even Best Buy has steel case classics.  The package comes with a red envelope with a iron-on patch that says Enter the Dragon.  It comes with post card sized photographs of all the memorable moments from the movie.  It comes with one of the original premiere tickets that says Ally of the Dragon.  The best goodie that comes with the package is a hologram/lenticular that shows Bruce Lee during the nunchuk scene.  Warner Brothers is obviously trying to milk as much money as they can off the movie.  I just hope Bruce Lee's family, like Linda Lee and Shannon Lee are benefiting from this release.  If not, it's a shame Warner Brothers didn't put more effort into making a better 40th Anniversary.  Always a five star movie, but the 40th Anniversary is a 3 star from Warner Brothers (for the price tag).
B00AALX5SI|4.0|This was enjoyable to watch... at first i wanted to know more about this performer but this was sooo phun to watch and to cry to... it was a treat for the artistic eye and touching... i really liked getting to see more about this performer and to touch lightly into her personal side not many performers allow anyone to see... she is special... she is VERY talented and she is real... watch and INjoy!<br />namaste
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I had heard about this book a while back and actually thought I had read it in a literature class I took in college, but alas, I had never touched it. I was quite surprised by the story and the turn of events. At first I felt sorry for Heathcliffe but as things progressed, he seemed to me like an evil person; I think Mrs. Dean helped to make me biased. Then again, when one has endured years of maltreatment, it is not surprising for the person to seek revenge. It is a very long read so be prepared. Also, if you are not used to old English talk, it would help to acquaint yourself with it. I was very thrown off by Joseph's speeches; I could hardly understand anything he said.<br />I did, however, find a BBC movie based on the book on Netflix and, even though it was nothing like the book, it did help to shed some light on a few gray areas. I recommend reading the book first, then watching the movie.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Just not what i was expecting when I bought the book. It seems clever but it remains thready and empty.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always loved solitaire. I play it on my pc and this just makes it easier to access on my Kindle.
B0072X2NUS|3.0|2 of my very fav artists come together and was not very happy with the music at all. Shipped quickly & was brand new.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I liked this book, but it didn't seem up to par with his other adult fiction. It wasn't as witty as the others, but it did have a good list of characters. I felt, though, as if I had only just read the prequel to something bigger, something more substantial.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|brand new album of my favorite artist in the world...CAN NOT wait to see their show in September in DC.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Love the male point of view in this book.  It keeps you interested from beginning to end.  Hard to put this one down. Funny, sexy, romantic and sweet....it had it all!
B00004Y3OU|5.0|I love all aspects of this film and prefer the directors cut because I found the original release had left out a big part of the love story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game is fun and addictive. some levels are pretty hard and not so obvious to solve. but overall excellent game.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My four year old likes this app. He likes to see the things grow and harvest them. Very repetative though.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I bought this book for three reasons:<br /><br />1. I LOVED the way that Reza dealt with the Fox News interviewer, who couldn't grasp the fact that a religious scholar might be qualified to speak on a religious figure, even if said scholar doesn't think the figure divine. If you missed that gem, just type \\"the most embarrassing fox news interview ever\\" into google, sit back and enjoy!<br /><br />2. During the interview, Reza said that the book provided an analysis of the historical Jesus, the political activist. Even though I'm an atheist, I've always been fascinated by the historical Jesus. I loved the way that 'No god, but god' brought Mohammed to life in a way that was completely surprising and intriguing. I hoped that Reza would do the same with a religious figure I'm much more familiar with.<br /><br />3. I came to Amazon and saw that the mental midgets had decided that they should give the book 1 star because, well, Reza is a muslim (where did I hear that before?).  I always watch movies picketed by wowsers, and read books hated by intellectual dead ends.<br /><br />So my 5 star is given, at this stage, to offset a 1 star review given by a deadender.<br /><br />I will come back and give my actual review when I've finished the book.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Just read all 3 books on my kindle in 2 weeks. Absolutely the story of Harry and the Barrington family. Best of archer' s since Kane and Abel. Really hope book 4 and 5 arrive soon.
B002DEZXOE|4.0|Great documentary from my personal time frame.  Only wish that there would have been a bit more music and a bit less talk.  Overall very good.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|but it looks just like it! the best thing, in my opinion, is that you don't have a &#34;fake&#34; you have a watch that may appear inspired by a daytona or in a same style. get a lot of compliments with this.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|...so I doubt I could be so eloquent. But this was an absolutely fantastic book. The narrator was unique, but not off-putting as I was afraid he might be. And I laughed in the few spots where the author spoke through him. The characters were well-rounded, with reasons to dislike and love (mostly love) them all. I normally find it difficult to read anything that takes place in this period of history (my mind can never wrap around the horror of Nazi Germany/ Europe at this time), and for once, with this colorful cast, I could picture it all. This is one of the best books I've read in a while.
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|i'm a big fan of the bourne movies and i like renner a lot but it's just not that good of a movie i wish i could give it a bigger endorsement but i did enjoy the movie for what it's worth...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I can't have a horse so I like this game. One of the best apps ever.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|timeless movie with a great cast that shows an in depth look at the endemic rivalries that currently brew not only in venice beach but throughout america. with phenomena like the zimmerman case fresh in our mind, this movie shows real white supremacists and racists, their repentance and the ironic twist in the end that leaves you thinking.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|This is definitely a departure from the original, but in all the right ways. Has the right amount of campiness and scares.
B0030MM68O|5.0|amazing movie coming from a person with discretionary taste in movies especially war movies. jeremy renner has grown on me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Could be better. Sometimes it doesn't word right. But overall it's pretty good. Social network is kinda weird... hope you enjoy this app.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  It was an easy, fast, entertaining read!  I would recommend this book to a friend.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This may just be the one for me!  I have tried many for sure. This is easy to follow and it works!  I have lost a total of three pounds in 2 weeks, and have actually been down as many as 5 since I started. I really like not having to count calories except on my two fasting days.
B00CATSONE|5.0|It was such an interesting and inspiring read. I highly recommend it to any who are interested in history, science, the struggle of man or genius.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|This is a great dvd for Dr Who fans. It establishes a new Doctor and Billy Piper is a great companion .
1400096936|5.0|\\"The Power of the Dog\\" starts in 1975 and follows the DEA's involvement with the War on Drugs and various aspects of Operation Condor. It took the author over 6 years of writing and research before its publication. In every aspects it is evident the tremendous effort he has invested into his version of events and has provided us with a fast paced page turner that is impossible to put down.<br /><br />Set on the US/Mexican border, we witness mainly through the eyes of Art Keller the beginning of his operative work with the CIA on Operation Condor and through the next 29 years as he attempts to do his job while not becoming a victim.<br /><br />I was easily sucked into the whirlpool of characters in all shades of black and grey, into the corrupt agencies and the government underhand encouragement, actively financing the development of the drug cartel. This story is a tapestry of violence and depicts actual events some may remember, we are not spared the true ugliness of war, the word excruciating may be apropos during some sections. This is a dense novel, rather pessimistic but in no way does it drag. The prose is energetic, intelligent and has the right rhythm for the subject as the sprawling saga shifts points of view.<br /><br />This story may not be for everyone it is nevertheless a captivating read I would recommend
B0090SI582|4.0|The Wolverine is hands down amazing.  From its spectacular cast to its interesting story to the great visual effects.  The Wolverine is a must see!<br /><br />My only problem with this movie is that it lags a bit in the middle.  Besides that, The Wolverine is great.  Another problem with this movie is that it was made in 3D.  This movie does not need 3D at all. It is just a money grab.<br /><br />If you are an X-Men fan then go see it.  If you are not than see it anyway.  The Wolverine is almost like a standalone movie.  You really don't need to know anything about the X-Men before seeing this.  I didn't and I loved it.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for ages 10 and up.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Wolverine is a great movie.  Go and see it...but not in 3D.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I am so glad I FINALLY got around to completing the last book in Larsson's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Series. This one was a page-turner like all the rest, so if you are looking to move through books quickly then this series is for you. Plots are twisted, characters are unique, and the tempo is quick. Enjoy!
B002ZG99CC|1.0|Don't see this movie.  It is terrible.  BOTH Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith are terrible actors.  Everything about this movie is lame.  Watch the original.  It is way better than this crap.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I bawled, I sobbed...ocular waterworks in full glory. \\"Up\\" presented an existential message in the form of a simple, animated story. This film was definitely more about analyzing the goals we set out to achieve and the disillusionment we encounter through struggle while growing older, i.e. the human condition, rather than flight and adventure, per se; nonetheless, a most wonderful journey for all ages.  Succinctly, this is a well-crafted introduction to children of the value of life's obstacles.
B00849F82E|5.0|This is Chesterton at his sparkling best: wonderful wit, wonderful and creative examples, sharp thinking and an ability to dethrone some of the great names of his generation because he has a better sense of the truth than they do. It's a book that's clearer in its presentation than some of his others (which were probably written even more speedily than this one).  I first read this book years ago, and had forgotten just how marvellous it is.  I was probably too young at the time to appreciate it, as well.  A bit of maturity helps, however, and while reading it on Kindle I highlighted dozens of lines and paragraphs and, in some cases, several pages.  Even if you read nothing else by Chesterton, make sure you read this one.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This series is well done with huge character development during each episode. The story line is a complex multi level mixture of love, hate, admiration and respect. If you are looking for television that has the same feel as reading a good Book, Suits is your best choice.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a classic.  The premise probably couldn't have held up for more than a season or two, but each episode is a jewel.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|I was hooked after reading the first 30 pages or so but as the book continued I got bored. While each story is different, they all share a common theme. After understanding that theme, the examples become repetitive and almost preachy. Still, an enjoyable, educational read.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Excellent movie and a classic Bruce Willis. The DVD was of Perfect Quality. I would purchase again from this distributor.
B00AN0KGWE|3.0|Alot of unbelievable events. Confusing at times.  Liked season 1 much better. However, I will get season 3 when available
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I absolutely love these songs. So glad I purchased the CD. I'm planning to buy more of their CD's in the future.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Fox let everyone down when they canceled this show so quickly - and even failed to show the episodes in the correct order! The writing is witty, the characters flawed and believable. The ship, &#34;Serenity&#34; is a main character and has the beauty of an old friend. The effects, for a TV show were actually really quite good - the silence of space is a particularly strong concept, helps you really feel the vastness of space. Even if you don't like science fiction, or in this case space opera westerns, you should give it a try.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|You need this. Take any (modern) tv, and bring internet video to it. You can listen to your google music, play netflix, youtube, and anything you buy in the play store. Easy to set up, very clever, and works well. Very easy to que up many videos and lay and watch youtube on the couch.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show keeps you guessing. That's what I like about it. The acting is compelling and the story lines are interesting.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Great script, excellent visuals, awesome acting!  I highly recommend this movie.  I think this is one of Tom Cruise's best.  M83's soundtrack is electrifying.
B001UG56ES|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie I just had too see it again the little boy was as great as Hugh and Nicole.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I thought the movie was funny and cute, but also had some kick ass action scenes. Can't wait to see the second one.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This movie rocked from beginning to end. Aesthetically pleasing and I thought the plot flowed very well, was exciting, and the turns were not obvious.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|this is a good show, some of the situations they get into in each episode is repetitive makes it hard to watch more than a couple episodes in one day
6305949980|4.0|Thanks so much for the prompt handling of this movie.  Transaction went smoothly without any problems.  We will enjoy watching it many times.  Right time of year for this one!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Perfectly written by using quotes from books within books with the stories that so infallibly align the scars on our hearts.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is awesome you get to raise your own dragons and feed them. The only bad thing is it takes internet but got some good dragons like the double rainbow dragon and the rainbow dragon and Sun and moon
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is the best gangster  game I had ever played but for the people that don't  have enough enough money on their credit card
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is amazing. Whenever you are bored just play this game. The free part is even better. I truly recommend this game.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|It was so good! This is one of the best series I have ever read. I just love Stephanie plum!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|The story touches on emotions while staying exciting and you don't want to put it down. Good story, well written, I suggest it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love the book. Eben got into some deep things I could not understand, maybe because I was not there, and who knows if I could have explained it any better than he.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Between exceptional special effects, decent acting, and superior editing it's hard to find something to &#34;bash&#34;. The &#34;battle&#34; scenes are impressive for their tight action and the film is well-worth watching more than once, just to see everything that is occurring in the frames.
B008JEJOAG|5.0|Thanks to the Amazon & DHL,I got the shoes within 7 days from America to China.The large size of this type(12 M) is hard to find in my city,so shopping online is  good chioce.The clog is comfort and fit ,the color matching is perfect as well. I wore it last weekend to the beach,it was convient to do some sports.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We just now heard of it and am half way thru season 1.  We can not wait to see all three seasons.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game ever I would recommend this game It is very fun.It is good for a rainy day
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|T his game is fun and keeps you wanting to all day every day. however when you hatch an egg or use the breeding cave it sometimes takes too long even up to 4 days.But others than that it is a fun and exciting game that i guarentee you will like.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|this is an oldie but goodie.  relaxing viewing.  just watch MAC maximize his resources.  some of the solutions really work!!
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I'm biased toward Summer Glau, so everything she stars in rocks! But this series is thought provoking with great action.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|5 stars - An emotional roller coaster that I loved every minute of<br /><br />I'm so sorry I waited to read this book! Really I am.  Been trying to go back and read some of the ones I've missed along the way instead of accepting new review requests.  I recently read Hopeless by this author and that lead to this one.  This author is pretty much an auto-buy now.  A status that is hard to come by but so well deserved.<br /><br />What I'm not sorry about is that when I purchased this series, I bought it on audiobook.  This story has performance poetry as a part of it's plot.  I'm just not sure that I could have read it as well as it was performed by the narrator.  Hedi Baker narrated the book.  I hadn't ever heard her before but she was good.  Her voices were clear.  I could tell who was speaking.  There is one line that repeated a few times through the book by Will and there was never any doubt who it was.  I like that.  But the very best part was when she performed the poetry for the slams.  A slam is supposed to express how the person feels beyond the words.  There are several characters that perform a slam over the course of the book.  Every one of them was different and expressed the emotion that the poem conveyed.  I was so glad I listened for that part alone.<br /><br />So I read this over a couple of days but only because I was crazy busy.  Once I really started reading it, it was done in a few hours.  The emotions of the book are intense.  It blindsided me and had me reeling for lots of reasons most of which I can't even talk about because they are too spoilery.  But let me just say that this book is brilliant in it's plot.  It pulls you in and has you wondering how this can every go wrong.  Then it slams you in the gut but doesn't stop there.  The pounding continues as the story unfolds.  I wasn't content until the very end but still friends on twitter for some virtual hand holding to get to the end.  The thing is that I loved every minute of it.  Perfect, just perfect.<br /><br />The characters are incredible.  This author is so talented when it come to developing characters that I immediately connect with.  Layken is hurting over the sudden death of her father.  She's trying to be supportive of the move for her mother.  She's pretty lost though and finds strength and healing in the company of the neighbor, Will Cooper.  Their relationship is sweet and the chemistry strong.  I loved them together.  I ached for them as the punches from life kept hitting them.  It was so real. So unfair, just like life can be sometimes.  But best of all was the way they worked through them and fought back.  They were better together even when they were apart.<br /><br />This is YA and some of the very best I've ever read.  If you love YA, then this book, this author, needs to be on your very very short list of books to read.  You will not regret it.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]t perfect.<br /><br />The characters are incredible.

1423113462|5.0|According to my son:  best installment to the series of Percy Jackson.  Can't wait for new books to come out.
B002RKRTGO|5.0|Best book I have read and I think that the world should read so buy this book now cause of the world should read more about this book make more books bye
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Mainly great game and fun.  Played for hours and hours.  I would rate this beginner's to intermediate.  Beautiful graphics!  Enjoy.<br />I would recommend this game
B00E4W40C4|4.0|The movie was not all too bad, sure the story was changed a lot it had good action and different setting than other xmen movies, the 3d was not to good and notable, but if your a die hard wolverine fan then this is a good movie to watch, my only complaint is that there was not too many mutants in the movie and silver samurai was not too good of an addition but at least there was another wolverine movie to watch, ive been waiting for some time now.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use it daily. I love that I am able to use it to open emails and the checklist option is awesome. So far there is nothing about it that does not work for me.
1616551607|5.0|The quality, the paper, the weight and everything is simply unbelievably good.<br />I own Dawn and the quality of the illustrations and paper there were good but Sky is just very good.<br /><br />I've seen most of the images before in expositions, on the net or in the books I own there were a few<br />of them that I've never seen before and that was quite another surprise. If you are a fan of Amano you should get it,<br />if you are fan of Final Fantasy or an artist searching for inspiration you should look at it and see if you want to buy it. If you are a fan of both or art collector you must have it.<br /><br />The prices are more than worth it, I feel even that I've gotten this box for free!
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|I leveled up to level 25, and it is still impossible to win in normal mode. And since there no missions where it gets slowly harder the game becomes boring and frustrating and in my case uninstalled.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|can't wait to see more.  The cast is perfect and the scripts are cute, clever and every entertaining. More more!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|In some places it seemed a little slow but then you read the end and understand why. Very clever! Can't wait to read A Dance With Dragons!
B005544V6A|5.0|So entertaining while I was recovering from surgery.  Watched two seasons back to back and loved every minute. more more!
0061900656|4.0|I like this book. Illustrations are beautiful and it's a nice hardcover book. But the book is short and there are very few sentences to each page. Because of this, while cute and nice.....very little educational value to it. This more geared towards 2 years old's only.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|The commercials didn't do this movie justice. I had no intention on watching it till my brother told me that I might like it. Turns out it wasn't too bad! The most enjoyable aspect of it I think was the characters themselves more so than the plot or action.
B00136JS12|5.0|Just what I expected.  Great music, good sound quality, no compatibility issues with other devices.  Download was easy and fast
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I ended up only seeing Despicable Me because of a date, anything is better than a chick flick, but it turned out to be one of my favorite family flicks.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book was a quick read.  Very well written.  I loved the storyline between the 2 characters shared.  A very beautiful story.  I'm hoping there is a sequel.  Highly recommended.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game. I have had it a long time and it still amuses me. For a dollar its great.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It was a little slow at first for me, but I'm glad I stuck with it.  Truly a beautiful story!
B003D513TQ|5.0|I love this movie.  Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend are fabulous and worked together so well in the movie.  I think they absolutely captured the love, content and respect that the real Victoria and Albert had for each other.  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in history of the &#34;royals&#34;.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Lots of reveiws on this product. I'm new to headphone amps so wasn't sure what to expect. It adds some volume to headphones and even my jawbone speaker. Also has some EQ control. Definatley recommend this product. It is very reasonably priced so why not buy it. Enjoy.
B007C3TVNA|4.0|It is often I go into a Tilda Swinton movie with the idea that she'll give us an acting clinic.  She has become, perhaps, the British equivalent of Meryl Streep, and is nearly as synonymous with great acting.  Here it is the same situation (Notice she and John C. Reilly are in an indie vehicle--hardly destined for blockbuster status.)  except perhaps her understated performance is a modesty that is meant to highlight the subject matter rather than her acting ability.  The topic unfolds as a family drama should with no more to say about it here than a teenage tragedy is revealed.  Director Lynne Ramsey's adapted screenplay, and, especially, her directing (as well as Joe Bini's editing) play as much front and center as the title character by giving us a story and a scattered time-frame, which isn't just present an artsy, random hodge-podge, but a real medium of unveiling a dreadful situation.  Perhaps adding or lacking psychoanalysis or soul searching, the point may be that there is no point.  Perhaps the whole film experience is meant to show a vacuum that exists that's meant to be filled in by all of us.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I like all of Philippa Gregory's novels but this one was a little light and I thought it ended to early in Elizabeth of York's life.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|this CD is my all-time favorite...whenever I'm having a relaxed, chill, or happy day, this CD always makes it better. i actually bought it for my grandmother as well and she's always listening to it.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|This site gives a good cross-section of reader reviews and their honest opinions. From hotels to tour guides you'll find it here
B005PK56TA|5.0|Fabulous series with great writing and acting.  It's so refreshing to see something creative, exciting, and well-executed on t.v.  I love that the story is begun and completed in one season and a new story starts again with Season 2 using many of the same actors in completely different characters.
B008M87GJK|4.0|Up to date....Intelligent ...Clean App..no advertising<br />You pick from varied generous. topics<br />From top news ..to technology ..to science<br />News by continent ..US..UK..Asia..and more<br />Running scroll at top of current. breaking. headlines<br />Makes other News Apps look very inadequate!
B006LSZECO|4.0|To be honest, I don't know what I think about this book.  Definitely a page turner. But I think that the male protagonist's choices at the end were forced by the author. I can't help leaving this book without a little bit of disappointment. I expected more based on the quality of description and the complexity of the plot.  On the other hand, an excellent beach read.
B003F3FJQO|2.0|I was hoping for so much more.  Seriously, I get the Tom and Theresa are an item and have a past they are trying to remember but I got so bored with Tom being hung up on this chick for what seems like no reason.  Maybe it is just my hate of guys or gals who are so whipped in a relationship that reason and common sense are ruled out.  I have never rolled my eyes so much while reading a book.<br />Besides they overbearing dullness of Tom/Theresa the rest of the characters were fun to take the journey with(at least for me, not them). there development has matured nicely over the two books so far.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Wow.... just wow... why are you reading this, click on buy and watch how HD transfers are meant to be done.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|It was a nice read after a little Hunger Games withdrawal but it was a bit tiresome at times.  I would have liked it more with a little less about how scary the Grievers were and a bit more about the daily life of the charactors.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|I love this movie I figured since I have it on my Xbox 360 and watched it about a gazillion times I should at least get it in 3D!
0812993845|4.0|After reading the mixed reviews about this book, I was a little less than enthusiastic about reading it. But I am a Sophie Kinsella fan, so I forged ahead. The book was better than I expected based on the reviews. You must keep in mind that this is chick lit and chick lit follows a formula. If you are even remotely familiar with that formula, and Kinsella is a master, than you know how this story will turn out. You've got the couple, Lottie and Richard, who are just perfect for each other, even if they can't see it; you've got the misunderstanding - a proposal gone bad; and you've got the complication(s) that ensue until the very end of the book, when surprise - or not surprise - this is chick lit. Throw in another couple, Lottie's sister, Fliss, and Lorcan, best friend to Ben, the guy who complicates Lottie and Richard's relationship, and you've actually got a two 'will they?' or 'won't they' scenarios.  If you are even remotely wondering how all this will end you are probably not the type of person who should be reading chick lit. It's not about the destination - you know where it's going to lead; it's about the journey. The journey was a little predictable, the foreshadowing was a little obvious, but there were some laugh out loud moments and some twists that I didn't see coming. If you take the book for what it is, you won't be (too) disappointed.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great series and novels.  Martine is a master of his craft.  Timeless stories with plenty of intrigue and nuance.  5 Stars.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I missed the original airing of this series, and I was looking through amazon prime videos and stumbled on this and decided to give it a try.  Boy was I surprised. I am used to the hype around certain television programs especially those with a science fiction leaning. But this was fun, funny, light, different, and it never strayed too far from what it was meant to be, entertainment.  Throw plausibility out the window and enjoy. The character of the sheriff, played by Colin Ferguson, holds this series together.  Just enough action, just enough drama, and tons of fun. All of this in a one hour episode, just the way I like it. Most plot points are resolved in one or two episodes. This show never takes itself too seriously.  All of the reasons above are why I gave it 5 stars.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|While you are not going to find alot of surprises in RED you will find plenty of solid fun action,  with quite a few solid actors.  Bruce Willis as a retired CIA agent makes good sense and his demeanor is pretty good through the whole flick.  Morgan Freeman steals the show
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think it is temple run in a different way so Yahoo. And after a while it gets kind of f boring.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for. I would definately recommend this app to anyone looling for a calculator app. Thanks.
B0019IB0II|5.0|great read easy to follow and makes those who have developed their RIGHT side of the brain feel worthy.  I am a fine art artist working full time in my studio.

B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Very cute movie. Perfect for older kids that still enjoy a great children's story that has a big kid style!
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|If you love romance & suspense, this is the movie to watch.  Remember Julianne from DWTS and she has done a pretty good transformation to an actress. Josh since Transformers is always one to watch.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|An excellent read while on the bus or just curled up on the couch at home. From beginning to end of the book you get a major sense of the characters and how they are always growing and trying to improve their situations. A well written novel that one could share with family, friends, and kids especially! Lots of wonderful moral lessons could be told from the book.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Well made court room drama series, very consistent along season 1, season 2 and season 3. I recommend all three seasons.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I liked this book, although I'd be sure to read the epilogue first so you don't get confused. This book focuses on certain regions of the Game of Thrones world, so certain characters aren't included. There stories are found in the next book. Still a good read and a great development of the story. I'm enjoying Book 5 more though as I think the characters featured are more intriguing.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|It looks like a realy cool game but you have to make it free or not many people can get the game
B0015AARJI|5.0|always you need a estra controller in your console. know this battery lasts much longer that the older versions of this product
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I have been a follower of Rhonda Byne from the beginning of her book the Secret and have enjoyed them all.  The thing I really like about this book is that it is has daily activities that I can use to help improve my life and I have found that they have worked for me.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B007T7MIR0|4.0|simple and convenient. good stuff overall. But slightly slow some times although (overall) quite good for viewing files (ppt, esp.)
030758836X|5.0|I bought this book for book club and was going to read it on a trip we were taking. I finished it in 2-3 days and had to find a different book to take on our trip! This book will not disappoint you!
140006922X|4.0|For a Christian there should be no conflict between their faith in the spiritual truths of Christianity and the reasoning which informs academic and historical research, forming the basis of this book.  John Paul II reminds us that \\"there is thus no reason for competition of any kind between reason and faith.\\"<br /><br />Following in the footsteps of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, such as Augustine and Aquinas, the Christian may be assured that reason will never contradict the spiritual truths of the faith.  A fine academic work such as this book must be read with the understanding that although many do not believe that Jesus was God, all believe that he was a man.  Those who blindly criticize this book because it does not recite spiritual truths fail to value the book for the human and historical facts it details.<br /><br />It should also be noted that the \\"About the Author\\" section of the book listing omits the fact that author is an Assistant Professor of Creative Writing at the University of California, Riverside.
B00000I41J|5.0|I am a classic music lover, this is one of those magic albums that I keep listening again and again, over and over, it brings me smile.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|Amazing it was cancelled after one season.  It's one of the best things to come out of TV in a long time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very interesting to have to view different objects and piece together how they interact to open up the locked door.  cant wait for more levels
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Good action movie although somewhat predictable.  There was some decent acting and compliments the series.  The cinematography was pretty good too.
B005HSL626|3.0|I like it beacause you get to slice fruit and there's different modes like arcade mode and zen mode.<br />:),
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo addicting I love playing it you should get it it's like temple run and subway surfers so if you like those games you should get it I think it's better that temple run and subway surfers
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Rich r p g world with cool story line and interesting characters. Focus upgrades on survival strengths and regeneration combinations to minimize real money expenditures.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|I really like this album and it's a great first try with the new singer. You can't replace Khan, but Tommy does a great job. Not every track is stellar, but at least half are really good. Looking forward to future releases.
1490313370|4.0|As a child we are trained by our parent to get a good job with benefits and stay there if it kills us. Yes, your inability to decide your fate is left up to someone else, who does not have your best interest in mind. Funny book that will make you laugh at your self.

B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I wanted to download the game not a guide. I didn't need a guide and it wouldn't download on my kindle. I wanted the game.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|Enjoyed the heck out of this, one of the action adventure flicks I will watch more than once. I really liked the character portrayals, took me back!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Satisfying and action-packed sci fi, with exceptionally original design of aliens, aerial vehicles, visual effects, and fabulous sound effects design. Well-paced with no lags in excitement or the action scenes. Despite downplayed reviews and not being a huge moneymaker at the box office, it's still worth adding to your collection if you're a sci fi fan.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Looking at some of the other reviews and ratings, I am understanding what all the talk is about.  While my husband reads our morning paper, I open up my Kindle Fire HD and look at the Weather Channel.  What ever day you changed from the old version to the new version on this app, it took me by surprise!!  I like the new version, but I like the old version better---due to it wasn't all garbled up with all this stuff that a lot of people do care to look at.  Now my first weather channel I look at in the morning is &quot;acu weather.<br />  I still check out the weather channel, but I don't like to go through all the things you have to go through in order to just get the weather for the day.  I do believe you can take some of the old and some of the new, and have a great &quot;Weather Channel&quot;!!<br />Hope to see a update soon.{Debbie--Fort Wayne, IN}  One and a half STAR is the best RATING I can give at this time.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was a really great movie that helps you see things from four different angles in the world of business and how people need to value the gift of life. I love the repeated examples on how God speaks to you in so many different ways, calling you to come unto him and even when you mess up, your mess can be a living testimony to help someone else in their time of need.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I am on this game at least twice a day and I love it. I wish I could get more money but otherwise it's awesome.

B005IZLPKQ|3.0|This DVD arrived quickly and in a separate mailer in the box with 2 other DVD's.  The DVD was loose in the holder, which concerned me, but when I opened it, I did not see any visible damage.  When I watched the movie, it had a lot of static and froze up several times.  I had to skip some sections to get it to continue playing.  I washed it at one point to see if that might help, but it continued to freeze up.  I don't blame this on the shipper, but I do wonder how the DVD became loose in the sealed case.  I will be returning it but need to get the info on how this is done.
B003Y5H5JM|4.0|I like to read, maybe more than the average person these days.  But probably much less than a truly well-read man.  That may not be much to say, but I think it useful to know something of the qualifications of a internet comment.  Not knowing much better, I've tried to emphasize the titles considered \\"essential reading\\".  As I've gotten older, I've been able to revisit some literature for additional experience.  But I'm no scholar or Shakespeare expert.  I've read most of his plays, and enjoy the challenge of the language \\"puzzles\\".  This age we live in where we can search the internet for filmed adaptations of books we enjoy is entertaining and sometimes educational.  So the online reviews are something I enjoy reading.<br /><br />I recently \\"re-read\\" The Tempest, and then saw there was a fairly new film adaptation.  I became a fan of Helen Mirren many years ago when \\"Excaliber\\" was a new movie.  I enjoyed the recent film adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Northanger Abbey\\" with Felicity Jones.  And I figured the supernatural elements of The Tempest would make a good \\"blue-ray, home theatre\\" movie.<br /><br />I'm pleased with the investment I made.  The movie was entertaining.  Worth watching a second time, with subtitles ON, to confirm the faithfulness of the dialog to the original source.  Worth watching the bonus documentary describing the production of the film.  Worth owning for some future evening to watch again.  I think it must be hard to remain as accurate as possible to the play as it was written, and also satisfy the average movie watcher who's been shaped by the more popular film titles of the past 30 or so years.  I'm glad to find any adaptation of classic literature that remains basically faithful, so I give this film some consideration on that score, even if I hadn't thought it very good.<br /><br />But I thought it was pretty good...very good maybe.  Not GREAT, but I can't say exactly why not.  And certainly not deserving of any poor opinion from me.  Themes of forgiveness, release, freedom to grow, are all represented.  I thought the visualization of Caliban (the slave) was very good.  His film presence was the strongest of all characters, which I didn't catch as a reader.  From a purely love of beauty perspective (superficial man values), I think Felicity Jones (Miranda) is very attractive, and also innocently appealing.  Helen Mirren is more my age, and has remained as handsome as one could ever hope for.  In this film, she's depicted as a weather-beaten, island survivor, and then also as a well-preserved, healthy senior queen.  I'm attracted to her in both states.  There's an irony (to me anyway) that as an actor, she's survived and succeeded in an industry that places so much emphasis on youth.  In the play/movie, her character also survives to eventual maturity and triumph.  The other actors were also good.  I really have no complaint at all about this movie.  The dialog of the Shakespeare play is famous, particularly the final epilogue, which can be interpreted as Prospero/Prospera, or in my understanding, as Shakespeare's request of his reader.  Adapted to music, this prayer is presented during the film ending credits.  I thought it was particularly effective, and recommend anyone who watches the film to be prepared by reading the text, or turning on the closed caption.<br /><br />I'd like to add my approval for this film to the internet data base, and hope that dvd sales might validate the effort that was made to bring the play to film.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I enjoyed Enterprise, as they made new stories from the &#34;dawn of Star Fleet&#34; without making too many changes to the original series body of work.  This is compared to the new movies, which butcher the story lines from all the other lore!
0062255657|5.0|Another amazing work from a prolific author.  This book is magical in the way that magic happens in the \\"real\\" world, not with zip-zap and wands and faerie dust, (although those things are great too) rather, this is magic filled with mystery, awe, a touch a fear and buckets (an ocean full) of wonder.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to search and collect photos relevant to various topics and interests ... in my case, for book research ...
B006AN78XS|5.0|Its a nice feel good movie with a great message. I love the music and story line. Hemingway is AMAZING! =)
B00BS4RGFE|5.0|Despite his ongoing dedication to the TV show &#34;The Voice,&#34; Blake has once again managed to produce gold with &#34;Based on a True Story.&#34;  His lyrics and vocals rise and fall like the tides of the sea.  The bonus tracks will get you going and I would highly recommend the Deluxe Version of the album in order to get the best quality versions of those future hits.  Don't pass this one up!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I really liked this album.  My wife and family hated it, but I like these old gravelly throated geezers.  Talkin bout my generation, I guess.
B00D5YNQMW|5.0|Casey Patrick Tebo did an amazing job capturing concert footage from Aerosmith's shows in Japan in 2011 and he got some amazing moments of the band out and about enjoying Japan. This is definitely a dvd worth buying, especially if you're a die hard Aerosmith fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire...where to even begin. This sequel is my favorite book of the entire Hunger Games trilogy. It has got every single thing I love from romance, action, suspense, to drama. After reading the Hunger Games I didn't think Collins could surpass reader's expectations but she did. Catching Fire is outstanding in all ways. It's yet again phenomenally written, with multiple layers of character complexities, interweaving stories, and many unpredictable twists. Katniss and Peeta's relationships gets infinitely more complicated, and they have a lot at stake. You'd think that them winning the games would make their lives easier but it actually threatens to destroy all that they've accomplished.<br /><br />Before reading Catching Fire I was thinking to myself how could Suzanne Collins go any further with story, what could possibly happen next? Once the direction is revealed what the story builds up to is insanely impressive. I didn't see it coming and most likely nor will other readers. Katniss is pushed up against a wall, and comes back fighting harder than ever before. She has so many important choices to make, and if she doesn't make the right ones her family, friends, and the other districts may be put in jeopardy. There's a downpour of emotions and plenty of turmoil to keep your heart pumping. There is a whole new set of characters introduced, and one specifically who took me by surprise. Finnick Odair who is new to the story is insanely awesome. I didn't expect to become a fan of anyone else in the series but he made me fall for him. He's attractive, sharp, clever, charming, and his weapon of choice is a trident. Say what? Yes he impales his enemies with a trident. I was instantly reminded of Aquaman and that comparison mostly rings true. He's a vital character in Catching Fire and he plays a significant role in Katniss and Peeta's lives. The twists and turns in this novel are an unstoppable force. You won't be able to stop reading until you've met the last page, it's that addicting!<br /><br />Despite the odds against Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark they won the 74th Hunger Games, but their lives are still on display. Now more than ever they have to convince the Capitol that they are as madly in love as they claimed to be. A new type of games is afoot and Peeta and Katniss are given no other option but to be a part of it. With everyone watching their every move Katniss can't afford to slip up or enduring the games will seem like piece of cake compared to what she could now lose. Uprisings are occurring, society rules are getting stricter, and no one is safe from the government. It's up to Katniss to do something about it before things get out of hand and circumstances get even grimmer.<br /><br />It's an astonishing sequel that will captivate readers in a whole new way. It's intense, has copious action sequences, and digs deeper into the history of the Hunger Games. Uprisings are happening in the outlying districts of Panem, and it's inciting rebellions all over. Katniss is one of the fiercest character's I've ever read about, she does what she has to, and makes selfless decisions. Although I love her character because of her actions I just as easily dislike her for not seeing the obvious--that Peeta and Gale are both in love with her. All the signs are there but she's totally clueless to their feelings, and confused about her own. Peeta is still Peeta, and I just adore his charisma, and his undying loyalty to her. Their relationship is really tested to the limits and how they deal with each other is very amusing.<br /><br />Catching Fire is riveting from the get-go, and will lure you right into its imaginary, and dangerous world. The violence continues to grow, and the government shows the extent of their power by hitting the districts hard. Katniss and Peeta face life-altering decisions, and not one district is left unaffected. The story is poignant and raw bringing tears to your eyes like nothing you've read before.The characters will move you, and the story will tear at your heart. It's remarkably well-written and stunningly put-together. It's not hard to see the Hunger Games novels sticking around for many decades to come, Catching Fire is a must-read for mature young-adults & older!The characters will move you, and the story will tear at your heart.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|I bought this game for my Nintendo 3DS (which also plays DS games) and it was really worth it. This game has a related game for 3DS, Zero's Escape: Last Virtue Reward, which I intend to buy.<br /><br />It's like you are playing a \\"Saw\\" movie. You are trapped inside a sinking ship and have 9 hours to escape. There are 8 more people in the same situation (at least is what they claim), and you have to cooperate to reach a specific door (door number 9) that is the only one that allows you to escape the ship. However, not everyone is cooperative, and the task isn't easy to accomplish.<br />There are many options of paths to follow, and different endings can be achieved. You have to solve puzzles to advance the history; different choices (wich door I go, who goes with me, do I agree with that) can change the puzzles you're going to face (there are about 15, and for sure you'll have to play it at least 2 times through to get all of them).<br /><br />The game is intended for mature audiences. Expect to see blood and read slang words, but not much worse than that.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Excellent history, many surprises<br />-You never know who you should trust in the game<br />-Multiple paths, multiple endings<br />-When you play again (believe me, you won't play it just one) you can fast-forward the text you have already read<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Sound is good for a DS, but obviously isn't like a cinema<br />-When playing again, you have to solve again some of the puzzles (it will take only a few minutes, though, since you already know what you should do)<br />-Hard to stop playing after you begin (not sure if a pro or a con)
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|long awaited return of the great Joe Satriani chicken foot did not do him justice as he could not let his talent be shown but a return back to solo is well worth , this album could go down as one of his best yet  Unstoppable Momentum is a well done album give it a chance i think you'll agree best work yet
B00D4ABW82|5.0|First off, this album does sound different from WCAR's last 2. But I think it sounds better then their others, feels like its all put together a lot better. There's more cleaner vocals but that's never necessarily a bad thing. I'd recommend this to anyone that like WCAR. Don't judge bands for changing their sound a little.. Bands have to evole to continue what they do and to evolve they have to change.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|The first time I watched this movie years ago, I was hooked.  From the first time -  the scenery, the music throughout, all of the cast and my personal favorite - Bart the Bear!!! (God rest his great big heart!)  It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout and still  stay a bundle of nerves even though I've watched it dozens of times. Wish the language was toned down, but hey, you can't have everything!!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|If you grew up in the late 80's early 90's you are going to love this movie.  Other than Jean Claude's make looking horrible the movie is pretty flawless.  Very exciting, lots of tongue in check moments that make you laugh and the story is very decent.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|My son watched this in school and begged me to rent it....I rented it and immediately bought it because we loved it so much!

B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book is more related to the movie than anything else.  However the book works through a narrative from several different point of views and presents a compling and plausable story of zombie war.  I could not put the book down and will read it again sometime soon within the next few months.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|This movie was okay, I would not deem it one of the funniest, but also not terrible!  It is just okay....
B000Y96EWK|5.0|This is the last in a part three series of the life and times of Jason Bourne who is really David Webb. Jason Bourne wants out but everybody and I mean everybody is trying to kill him. It is a very fast pace and action packed film. The bottom-line is this film answers all the questions for the viewer as well as for Jason Bourne of what happened to him in the first film. I gave it five stars because it was very entertaining with a very good plot and good triumphs over evil. Matt Damon was outstanding in his portrayal of Jason Bourne/David Webb. If you have seen the other two films then I strongly recommend seeing this one too. If you have not seen any of the films then by all means see the three Bourne films starting with 'The Bourne Identity;' then following with 'The Bourne Supremacy, ' and finally concluding with 'The Bourne Ultimatum.' I found all three films quite entertaining. The only other suggestion would be to read the books by Robert Ludlum the creator of Jason Bourne. Now for me only Matt Damon can portray this character! You may have heard of a follow on to 'The Bourne Ultimatum;' yes there is one but Matt Damon does not play the lead so in my opinion it is a waste of time!
B001NIC0A6|3.0|This is a cheesy movie, but I enjoyed it.  My kids love anything to do with volcanoes, so this was right up their alley!

B00594MB2M|2.0|Expected much more from this cast of characters. Good acting.  The first half was waiting for something to happen.  Finally got to know the characters, all suffering, and the answer to all is to crawl into bed with somebody...  Ended up not caring.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love Suits. I haven't finished season two just yet, but I can't get enough of this show. It reminds me of Boston Legal minus the sermon-esque, one sided trials. If these guys ever go inside a court room it would be a major event.

1595825045|5.0|I love the Last Airbender series so much but have found the DVD releases to be lacking in behind the scenes content. This book rectifies that. It's loaded with art, stories and notes from the very beginning of the animation process to the end, giving insight into the evolution of all the people, places, and things in this show.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Still watching the series and enjoying it.  The plot line and characters are good and well throught out, thanks for carry it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Well, I'll not delve into too many technical details, I'm sure there are more extensive reviews about it.<br /><br />How I'm I primarily using it? As a second-screen from my PC for playing video files.<br /><br />Here's my take-home - this is simply a way to view the visual content of your browser - and for some media websites like Youtube, it will allow you to play the audio and video in full screen mode - and with the full resolution that you would expect from your PC.<br /><br />Shortcomings?<br />1. It DOES NOT have a way to play your local video files (maybe they'll figure out a way to do that down the road) **Update - there are workarounds for this that I'm testing out****<br />2. It requires a power-cord attached to it. They should have made this an option, and allowed users to use batteries. The main problem here is that if you want to attach it to your TV which is neatly hanging on a wall, you better have a spare power source behind the TV itself, otherwise, you will have some ugly wire hanging from the TV to a power-source below<br />3. Your TV remote will NOT be able to pause/play/rewind/forward Youtube videos - you need to control these functions from your PC. I'm sure this will not bother folks who are casting from a mobile device like a phone or tablet, since it's not cumbersome to have that in your hands - but I'm old-school, I like my TV-Remote!!! They should have included Remote Control Protocol or at least provided a small companion remote with at least the four media-control keys (pause/play/rewind/forward)<br /><br />Other than that, I would say it's worth the 35 bucks - as long as we have the promise of added functionality down the road.
B0058SNKRY|5.0|I LOVE these Crocs ! very comfortable, elegant, and cute !!! They fit exactly as expected. I'm definitely gonna order more of them ;)
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I read this book a while ago. I came back to purchase it for kindle and decided to read some reviews. I clicked on the 1 star reviews and can't believe the immaturity of some people.<br /><br />Surely if they had read this book recently they must have heard of the sexual content. Yet they buy it and give the book 1 star because they felt.uncomfertable reading it.<br /><br />Quite frankly the book has no more sex in it than real life does. Are people expecting that because it may make a few people feel awkward reading it that characters aren't going to do anything sexual?<br /><br />I believe that this book is perfect. I would reccomend that anybody with a mature adult mind give this book s read. And not to discard it due to 1 aspect of the book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I Love the app and the upgrade!! I just had to figure everything out on the upgrade! I love it though!

B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|To be honest the game is pretty good. The background is scary and the music get your heart racing but I really with they had more levels it's really fun also that the day and th  dark is the same but it's still scary. One last thing when I first got the game I so scared when I started playing I quickly shut off lol ;P it's a good game.

B00DXP7L88|5.0|It is difficult to believe that this is the 8th season of DEXTER and sad to know that the series ends with this season. The show has come a long way in sophistication of writing and quality of guest starts.  Most of the main characters are still present - Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, Desmond Harington, James Remar, C.S, Lee and Aimee Garcia - but in the wake of the last season climax when Debra murdered LaGuerta in front of Dexter, Debra has a strong case of the fall-a-parts, turning to alcohol and pills until the intervention of an odd psychologist Dr Vogel (Charlotte Rampling, as splendid as ever), who knows Dexter's history intimately, becomes involved in the increasingly bizarre events that create a push-pull relationship between Dexter and Debra.  Toss in some serial killers as twisted as any the writers have created and we're on our way for a terrifying rollercoaster ride.  Seems like this season is going to be the strongest yet. Grady Harp, July 13
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|What a useful tool when I travel or when I want a backup alarm for days when it's very important to be on time.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book. Read it first about seven years ago. Had some intense family situations going on and I kept thinking I should reread it. I finally did and it helped immensely. The second agreement alone will make a world of difference for most people I believe. &#34;Don't take anything personally&#34;. Can't recommend highly enough. I've am getting ready to reread another book of his as well, Mastery of Love.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the pace of the book and the many twists and unexpected turns. It  made me want to read other books by Gillian Flynn.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Hilarious and heartfelt.  Outrangeous and tender.  Harold is funny but Maude makes the movie great. Really good soundscore.  A great movie.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This was the first movie that I was surprised at the ending never saw it coming,kept you on edge threw the drama and the love story.
B005HED08I|5.0|Star Trek truly stands the test of time with how creative the story telling is and how compelling the characters are. I love being able to watch this series again on my iPad. What a treat!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Hit after hit, The Eagles are the best soft rock band ever and this dvd shows it.  They brought the house down in Australia
B009NY43NY|3.0|These books are mindless drivel, but I've read every last one of them, and now the series is done. Thank goodness! So very different from the HBO show that they really aren't the same animal. I hope Sookie stays Dead Ever After because she was getting on my last nerve.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I bought this because of the reviews. The 3d disc was played on Samsung tv & blu-ray equipment and it made the animation pop.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book took me forget to read. The sex scenes are very creative. Never been a person down with S&M  but I am now rethinking that.  The book was very good at opening my eyes on that....on to book number two.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I have had many YouTube apps and this is by far the worst one. I paid to not have ads yet they still play. Now when I try to play a video it will only play in 380p, it's ridiculous! Unless they actually spend time improving this app I wouldn't bother.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|one of my favorite games. I could play it forever!! ive only spent a little of my actual money but you can play and breed anything without actually using any money!
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|For those who have not read the book, this adaptation is not too bad.  However, there is so much depth.  The A&E/BBC version with Colin Firth was fabulous, but takes almost 6 hours to watch. So, if you aren't looking for the whole story and have only a few hours, I definitely recommend this, but otherwise, take the time to watch the previously mentioned mini-series version.
140006922X|5.0|Dr. Aslan has written a fantastic, informative, and well founded piece on the most talked about man in history, and presents his findings of over 20 years of academic research in writing that is accessible to any and all readers of the english language. He also includes about 100 pages at the end of the book in notes, which back up his findings. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in the historical Jesus, a point he clearly outlines in an early chapter and differentiates between the more popularly discussed ideological Jesus. Even if you are a watcher of FOX news with a biased, islamophobic agenda, you can read this book as it uses easy language to explain over 2000 years of religion (he starts with the Roman Empire and goes on from there). In the intro and prologue, Dr. Aslan also discloses his personal experience as a born muslim, a teenage convert to Evangelical Christianity, and conversion once again to Islam. Dr. Aslan has published many other books which I look forward to reading, as they have an academic background.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is a great at way to kill some time. It is also a good way to make sure you know how all the game mechanics work before humiliating yourself publicly.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Liked the season although it was very slow. I would say that season two was the best so far, but season three was pretty unpredictable and well produced. I don't want to spoil it so I will leave it at that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun and simple game I really really really really really really like this game. Hope they make another game like this
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|this game is boring what else is there to say. Oh how about I hate it snooze. fest big time
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I purchased this book based on the stellar reviews. I am shocked. While I did read the book in one sitting, and it was interesting- it certainly isn't 5 star worthy in my opinion. It lacked a solid plot and was....well....just odd. Adult fairy tale is the farthest thing from my mind when describing this book.  More- just a bunch of things written on paper. If it wasn't a week after my purchase- this would have went back 25% in.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|The Watchmen is very dark and strange, but as a woman with 2 boys- now young men, I've seen every action-hero flick made in the past 20 years, and found it refreshing to see a grown-up super hero movie.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Why did you update the HD version of cut the rope and forget the original version of cut the rope.
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|Am a big fan of the original, and felt like they did a good job with this prequel.  Have watched it 3 times, so far.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The game would not load at all. I tried to uninstall & reinstall several times but still nothing. Very disappointed.
B000ICXQOM|4.0|What can I say...it's a Killer B classic!  Like so many other campy horror flicks...The Blob, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, and it's predecessors, Evil Dead, and Evil Dead 2...it's just something that you have to see.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Funny movie, sarcastic humor, nice final. For adults very recommended, no for kids. Minions are so great part of the movie.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Easy to setup and use. Delivers exactly the information the developers talk about. The graphics along with the weather maps are excellent,. The ability to select four additional locations, plus your home or current location is a nice feature. Great app.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was absolutely incredible. I was expecting a contemporary romance where girl meets boy and love somehow happens, but I got so much more than that. Hopeless was deep and gritty and complicated. And beautifully written. And intense.<br /><br />Hopeless was such an amazing story. The title, though incredibly perfect, was misleading at first. The book was not about hopelessness at all. Rather, it was full of hope and love and acceptance. It was so not hopeless. And despite the first impression of Holder and what the synopsis implies, Holder wasn't hopeless, either.<br /><br /> I loved Sky. Her character was so real. She was smart, funny, brave, and complicated. I loved her perspective and the way she looked at the world and how she fell for Holder while also attempting to not fall for him. And how she was so nonchalant about everything until she met Holder and his intensity opened her up. It was so perfect.<br /><br /> I liked how I didn't know what was going to happen and how the characters never made a big deal out of nothing. Nothing in the plot was for drama's sake. Conflict wasn't added to create drama, but was there for other reasons. It was such a flawlessly executed storyline that shocked me so many times. And I also enjoyed how the story made me laugh and also made me sad. It made me feel a wide range of emotions.<br /><br /> I don't want to give any parts of the plot away. It was incredible and I had no idea what to expect. I loved it and I highly recommend it. It wasn't a light read, but it was the kind of book that was so well written and interesting that you just can't put it down. It dealt with so many issues without being an \\"issue\\" type of novel. I can't wait to read more of Colleen Hoover's books.
0870703781|4.0|great content but the quality of the actual book wasn't 100%<br /><br />i recommend, but be weary that it maybe titled new and it being not 100%

B00000IZOR|1.0|From the item description I expected the toy to make some sounds like ringing eventually, saying \\"Hello\\" or what ever. My mistake - do not expect too much.<br /><br />Also as others says: the headset cord is extreemly short. So, the only usage is drag for the other cord and look for eyes rolling. But it doesn't develop phone communication skills.<br /><br />Both my kids (have twins 15mo) played just about 10mins with it.<br /><br />They like phones in general (toys and real ones). But they ignore this toy.<br /><br />Wasted money.
B000QFQE4U|3.0|I decided to watch this movie once again after more than 10 years. The reason was because I had to read the book in school. This movie was basically made to glamorize this enigmatic and powerful figure in Spike Lee style. You want the real story? Read the book.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this not knowing what I was getting myself into but like every other Logitech product it is awesome!
B005U9REU0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever. Something about watching Muppets, Jennifer Connelly, and David Bowie's package in the same movie is just right.
140006922X|1.0|If you do not believe Jesus is God and are in need of some chauvinistic cheerleading for your disbelief, this book is for you.  If you believe Jesus is God, you might find this book offensive.  Whether you believe in Jesus or not, if you are looking for thoughtful, well-researched scholarship into the person of Jesus and his claims of divinity, you won't find that in this book.  Zealot is nothing more than an attempt to tear down belief using the author's unsubstantiated prejudices and opinions.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|The movie alone is worth the price of this product. It includes the theatrical version and the extended version of the horror classic along with the European version of the movie and the documentaries for this movie. This is a must have for all horror movie lover's.

B005ZD8I6K|5.0|This is one of the best movies out there, love the performance from Brandon Lee.  Such a bummer he is gone
B006LSZECO|3.0|And not only is she gone in the physical sense, but oh so much more. It was a see-saw read for me. You can't stand one character, then you think they are not so bad as you realize you can't stand the other. The author does a fantastic job with her characters and her story line. What a mind! I would have given it four stars, but she did such a good job of not making me like the characters that I can only give it a 3!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast's website says it's the \\"easiest way to watch online video and music on your TV\\" and I have to agree that once you're set up (which takes only a couple minutes at most), it's extremely easy to send things from my computer or phone to my TV. I have mine plugged into my audio receiver, and I've played around with 'casting' Spotify, Soundcloud, Showtime, Hulu and more to my TV from my Macbook and they all work really well (particularly the music sites). It's much easier to just cast something than deal with plugging in my Macbook via a HDMI cord...and I get the added benefit of being able to multitask while things are playing on my TV.<br /><br />Chromecast really has two features: i) pressing the 'cast' button from a mobile app or website--YouTube and Netflix for now, and Google Play Movies and Music for those that use it--and then ii) casting a full tab from Chrome on a laptop. You'll get better performance from the first feature, but being able to cast a tab from Chrome makes it so you can send virtually anything from the web to your TV. As Google announced at their event, they're already working with new content partners to integrate the cast button into more apps.<br /><br />The killer scenario to show how easy it is to start watching something on your TV is when I got a text message from a friend with a YouTube video to watch. I literally just opened the link from my text message, it opened up YouTube on my phone, and I pressed the cast button to send it to my TV. It took less than <30 seconds (Chromecast also automatically changed the input on my AVR for me). This is MUCH faster than if I used the YouTube app on my Smart TV, where I'd have to use a QWERTY keyboard/d-pad on my remote to start the YouTube app and search for the video.<br /><br />Well worth the $35.
B00448SE4S|5.0|The film version of the &#34;Scott Pilgrim&#34; graphic novels is a canny adaptation by the director of &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34; and &#34;Hot Fuzz&#34;.  Whereas the original graphic novels were black & white, the film is awash with glowing color, and the sound design is excellent.  It isn't without faults, especially when it comes to character development, but the ebullience of music, editing, and action more than make up for it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|They need more levels because this game is awesome and my 7 year old loves it! There is a lot of challenges
B003K15IF8|5.0|A librarian with spooky-good reader advisory skills recommended this book to me. Turns out that the novel is set in my home town of Columbia, Missouri. The protagonist is from a farming family (as was my grandfather) and falls in love with literature during college (ditto for me).<br /><br />This is an amazing work of literature. It is strongly reminiscent of Thomas Hardy's novels--the characters who live lives of quiet desperation, the moments of mysterious communion with nature, the relentless machinery of fate. Yet, Stoner is Hardy with a twist, a mercifully redemptive twist. Despite years of pain and loss and emptiness, this pitifully timid character leverages the meaning he finds in literature to develop self-awareness of his true identity. Late in life, he emerges as a man of quiet integrity and, even, nobility.
0061537969|5.0|This book is amazing.  The author paints a picture and it's different than anything you've seen before.  It makes you laugh and cry.  Amazing book.  Check it out!
B004X6PRO6|2.0|If you don't have a stomach for suffering, for God's sake don't read this book! I'm able to tolerate the occasional torture scene in my reading, so long as such scenes are justified by the larger purpose of the novel. But this book, which is set in North Korea, is 400+ pages of unrelenting, inconceivable brutality--page after page, day after day. Which is, I guess, the point: to stand witness to the actual suffering of so many people who, in the real world, endure entire lifetimes within corrupt, dehumanizing (and that's an understatement!) totalitarian societies.<br /><br />I only made it about halfway through the book before I flipped to the last chapter, which does contain a germ of hope. I think the author's larger purpose in this book is humane (to expose and repudiate brutality, to reflect on how people manage or don't manage to retain their humanity under extreme circumstances, to offer an homage to freedom), but read it at your peril!

B00A285OOW|3.0|I love this series but this is probably my least favorite book of this series so far. I can usually count on any Philippa Gregory book to be well written and entertaining even if, as so many say, they are only loosely based on actual history. Gregory's books usually highlight all of the secrets, scandal, and struggles of the monarchy and they make me want to find out more about these fascinating and often tragic rulers.<br /><br />The White Princess focuses on the court of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York at what Henry believes is the end of the Cousin's War. For some reason, this time, I was underwhelmed by the characters. It seemed that all of the dynamic players in this saga were mostly secondary characters in The White Princess. Henry's devout and powerful mother Margaret and Elizabeth's wily and resourceful mother Elizabeth were the real forces to be reckoned with. Henry and Elizabeth were very much overshadowed their more charismatic parent and ended up sounding ineffectual and even rather pathetic. My inability to connect with or empathize with Elizabeth diminished my enjoyment of her story.<br /><br />One thing that I noticed about Gregory's characters is that, when writing about the relationships between two sisters, they seem to always be shown as extremely antagonistic with the sisters being barely cordial to one another yet still loyal to their house. I found this to be true with Anne and Mary's relationship in The Other Boleyn Girl as well as with Anne and Isabelle in The Kingmaker's Daughter and actually remarked on the similarities between the two in my review of The Kingmaker's Daughter. I was a little disappointed to see this same theme repeated in The White Princess.<br /><br />Overall, The White Princess is good, it's not great, and definitely not what I was expecting. My friend, Samantha, who is a huge fan of The Cousins War series and has been dying to read this newest book even said that each time she begins reading The White Princess, she ends up falling asleep. I'm hoping the next book (will there be another in this series?) will be much stronger and more what I've come to expect from Gregory.<br /><br />Rating 3 of 5 starsup falling asleep. I'm hoping the next book (will there be another in this series?) will be much stronger and more what I've come to expect from Gregory.<br /><br />Rating 3 of 5 stars
B005HJWWW8|5.0|My Creative Zen MP3 player broke and I could not afford to replace it. I was able to get a great deal on an Apple iPod Touch 4 and was very disappointed in it. The way the iPod Touch manages the music and the sound quality are significantly below the standard of what I got with the Creative Zen. To help with music management I got Media Monkey instead of iTunes and for the quality of sound I got two items: This Headphone Amplifier and an iPod Touch app called Louder Logic.<br /><br />Together with Louder Logic this amplifier brought the quality of sound almost to the level that I had with the Creative Zen MP3 player. It is tiny and clips to my shirt. The cable that comes with it is just the right length so it does not get tangled or caught in gym equipment. The battery lasts for about 2 - 3 hours. I found that if I charge it after two workouts the battery never dies for me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this device.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|I give this game 2 thumbs up!!!!  No waiting hours at a time to accomplish goals. Energy is the main focus in this game and you will need it in order to build your city and collect money and harvest crops. If you run out of energy then visit neighboring cities to earn more energy.  You can do this every 10 minutes so game time is constantly going.  You can earn city cash without having to use the in app purchasing feature as well.  I totally recommend this game! If you enjoy this type of game genre then you will not be disappointed!  Thank you Gameloft for making awesome games!

B006LRUVUA|4.0|TeamViewer is a very useful utility to operate or view a remote computer.  I commonly use it to support family, friends and clients with their computer or applications.<br />I installed it on my Kendal Fire and after configuring it a bit I could use my lowly reader to &#34;see&#34; one of my PCs remotely.  I could operate the remote Win8 PC through the Kendal as if I was using it directly, albeit quite a bit slower.  During experimentation I judged that broadband speed was a significant factor in usability.  I would judge that on an android tablet things would go even smoother.  Its almost real time when using another PC on a fast connection.  Takes a small bit of experimentation and a short learning curve to make it really useful.<br />Dennis
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Alright.. I ordered 3 for the living room, bedroom and kids room. It works as expected and the video codec Google is using for Chromecast is fast and looks great with just 2 Wifi bars. This device compatibility will grow and I wouldn't be surprised to PPV apps crop up that will deliver special events through this product.<br /><br />I have noticed that LIVE YouTube video does not work yet (at least during my tests) but I expect this to also work within time.<br /><br />I can't be any happier with this product. My family is an Apple ecosystem (6 memebers= 7 ipads + 2 iPhones) household even with 1 Apple TV unit that hardly gets used because most times it streams from the iOS unit and if you go to a web page and want to play another video, what you're already watching on Apple TV will play it. Chromecast does not have this issue, one you start playing a video on Netflix or YouTube, you can continue to use the remote device.<br /><br />There are some rookie glitches with connecting at times but nothing that can't be worked around by restarting the app on your device and sure to be smoothed out on future updates.<br /><br />Overall, this product was able to add internet video capability to 2 non-smart HDTVs in the home on the cheap, and added to the living room TV (which is smart) as a faster and easier way to play video from our household mobile devices. I was about to buy a few Roku boxes but this product came out of the blue and solved our needs.<br /><br />For $35, it's cheaper than a night out at the movies in NYC. I highly recommend buying one just to be in the mix when that PPV premium stuff starts happening because it's inevitable.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/30/2013:<br /><br />I just successfully streamed on all 3 Chromecast at the same time 1080p video in 3 different rooms in the house with an Optimum Online 50Mbps plan line.. 2 from Netflix and 1 from Youtube. Solid performance.

B00BTHWFBK|3.0|After decades of false starts and rumors the original members of Black Sabbath finally pull together an album of all new material, the result is, well, underwhelming.<br /><br />As if working in a fever dream, Rick Rubin goes after one artist he's a lifelong fan of after the other and tries to get them to make the defining album. But, it seems he's really just directing them to a formula he thinks will give him what he wants to hear. Mediocre albums from Metallica to Linkin Park under his guide are proof that he can lead and he can lead astray.<br /><br />His formula for Sabbath, release a Follow-up to \\"Black Sabbath.\\" Only problem, they did, several from Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, We Sold or Souls, Vol. 4, Paranoid, one solid classic after another.<br /><br />Of course when Sabbath was just three members minus Ozzy it wasn't the original line up, yet add Ozzy and take away Bill Ward and it is? Well, that's semantics I suppose, what about the music?<br /><br />Well, 13 sounds like four guys trying very hard to sound like Black Sabbath, and it works, this is the best tribute band ever. The one obvious difference is the thunder, pounding drums of ex-RAM / ex-Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk replacing the sweeping jazz influence of the understated, underrated Ward. This makes a huge difference in the sound.<br /><br />The songs themselves are solid, but not stellar. There's nothing here to make you want to to stop listening, but little to want you to keep putting the CD back in either. After 30 years there needed to be a classic here, a Paranoid, an Iron Man, a Sabbath Bloody Sabbath to make this a truly memorable moment. This would have been a hard record not to embrace in the early 80's after Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die, but now it feels like too little to late.<br /><br />Sure, this is better than a money grab, real work went into this, but all that work feels mechanical, it feels like a by-the-numbers how to make a Sabbath record, record. After Ozzy's \\"Scream\\" showed that when inspired excellence can come forth, Sabbath seemed only inspired that they are getting along and writing music, but \\"God is Dead\\" just feels like it had to be the obvious song from 'this' band! Yet it doesn't feel like they really had anything to say but what's expected of them.wed that when inspired excellence can come forth, Sabbath seemed only inspired that they are getting along and writing music, but \\"God is Dead\\" just feels like it had to be the obvious song from 'this' band!

B0001CNRBG|4.0|Alan Alda's best movie.  In classic Alda style he has you falling off your chair in laughter.  A must see for all Alda fans.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is really fun! I recently realized though that there are achievements. These achievements get you Gru Tokens, which are hard to get. So if you are new to the game, check that out! It gave me lots of Gru Tokens
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely love this series.  It gives such a great view into the changes that were occurring during the time of the British class system.  I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the older time periods.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a great game and so much fun to play but what i think its stupid is that if you have a bucket and you have no more room in your inventory then if you fill the bucket the bucket disappears. I like how it has a creative mode and multiplayer so i can help my friends on creative or survival.
B007SSEZNA|4.0|I would recommend this to women that like cute, love stories.  It was good, but I wouldn't say it was excellent.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What an engaging show!  I am now a total fan!!! I cannot wait for the next season, as I am smitten with it!
0061438294|5.0|I like it a lot, there's a lot of examples and I learned much more than I was expecting to. I'm an animator, but it will definetly help with my day to day.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful characters, superb acting and interesting story lines are what we have come to expect of Downton Abby and this season does not disappoint!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The story line is amazing. The naming is a little tedious but once you get past that it is a really good book!
1118109791|3.0|If you're going to sit the GMAT I'd strongly recommend getting a copy of the Official Guide. Not because it is a good book to learn from - it's not - but simply for its large amount of real GMAT questions to practice on. This latest edition is pretty much identical to the two previous editions, its only real change is the addition of a (online access - you register the book) question bank (50) for the IR (Integrated Reasoning) section of the revised exam.<br />Frankly the explanations of how to solve math and verbal questions would be OK if you had unlimited time to answer the questions, but since time is in very short supply, in order to achieve a great GMAT grade you'll need to master a whole lot of new tricks for both the quant and the verbal sections. This is why I am only awarding three stars; but it is still a pretty much essential book for GMAT students.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|So fun to play, and extremely addictive. Works great on my kindle!<br />The physics are interesting, but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy to play.
B003Y5H542|5.0|This is another favorite of my six year olds.  He could watch this everyday on loop if I let him.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Well I already read the trilogy before reading this book so I already knew what was coming so I didn't find this very interesting. But if you are starting the series I would recommend starting with the Maze Runner because this book gives most of the stuff away that is supposed to be a secret for you to find out later.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It does exactly what it claims to do with gliches or bugs. I would recommend this app. I gave it a five star rating.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I love this bands music and it is easy to listen to, not hard on the ears at all, would buy it again.
1608871819|1.0|low rating due to most of the art in the book was released online which as a book collector  makes the book worthless if your buying for the art work concept designs.<br /><br />the writing process was not giving to much away that you cant find online.<br /><br />all in all save your money and buy another book.
6305882592|5.0|What I loved about this film is the macabre humor and  it's unique and unpredictable content. Also, the lovely countryside background added to it's charm.  I loved the movies ending and walked away with a warm heart and a smile on my face. A tender and touching rendition of an unconventional relationship between two human beings.
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|one of my favorite composers and this is one to add to collection if you a Han zimmer fan ,
B00992CF6W|2.0|ok i was in my minecraft world and i here TNT going off it was heronbrine and the next day in front of my house was a H made of nether rack then a note it said (leave or i will kill you!!!)
B00406O7YK|4.0|This was first time I had seen this movie, even though it's been around a while. I remember that when it was a hit on Broadway that Carol Channing had the lead. I had seen/heard her singing the &#34;Hello Dolly&#34; song years ago before the movie was made, just wasn't able view all without Carol as the star.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|So  that is why it is free. So this is how you play it:<br />You tap on a group of three or more squares of the same symbols.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this app. I love nemo so I thought to try it and it is really fun. I recommend it to everyone even older kids.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|This is a game you do when your sitting at home with nothing to do and you want to pass the time, the only problem is you need an internet connection,but other than that you have the option of speeding up the rabbits, so I guess you could say all in all it`s a pretty good game.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this game is so fun. I haven't seen the movie yet but I'm dying to. I recommend it to everyone
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Wow!  Has there ever been a better book in any genre?<br />A truly amazing read.  Max Brooks is a genius.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It works and does exactly what it is supposed to. It adds, subtracts, divides and multiples fractions to your hearts content
B00009ZYC0|5.0|Very good movie,I couldn't relax the whole movie. Very clever story, I would recommend this movie to people who like action or sci-fi.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|This is a good movie and the disc was in excellent condition, this is a movie that is easy to get into and watch all the way to the end!
B00008G7UJ|3.0|I thought the movie was a little strange with the past story and modern setting. It was just different than I expectected.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Not anything like the games on the computer.  Found it difficult to use. Good thing it was free. Deleted it!
B003QP4NPE|4.0|I've read the one and two star reviews here. They make some good points. But overall, I found the writing tolerable (and in a few places, quite good). The criticism of the characters is legit. They're fairly flat. But Suarez wants to keep the action going, so he falls short in character development. It's an interesting choice. If you spend time in character development, then readers criticize it for being too slow. This book is NOT slow.<br /><br />(spoiler alert) There is no hero. The characters you get invested in get killed. The ending is abrupt because this is half of a whole book, but it got to be too long, so he broke it up into two volumes. Ergo, the abrupt ending.<br /><br />Still, I give it four stars, in spite of those legit criticisms and the significant suspension of disbelief required with respect to many of the details (which others have pointed out). Suarez asks some very interesting questions. Is democracy viable in a technologically advanced society? Is the unholy alliance between corporations and politicians at the expense of the masses going to be our undoing? Will technology result in a democratization of power such that the age-old system of nation-states becomes increasingly irrelevant? Is the option going to be the loss of tens of millions versus billions?<br /><br />Those are interesting questions. He doesn't answer them in this book. I'm hoping he pursues those themes in the next one (Freedom).<br /><br />And, in the end, it was an entertaining read. Some people said they were bored with it. I had to just go with the story (suspend disbelief), but in doing that, I wasn't the least bit bored. The technology premise is fascinating: Could you in fact treat the real world like a game world and manipulate it accordingly? Well, certain entities do today, to a profitable extent.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good app really like it would recommend. Not too challenging but good enough. Wish it had more rooms to solve
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game was very choppy on my kindle fire.  Almost impossible to play.  It looked cute in the ad video
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Well written and is keeping my interest. It has revealed some inner working of special relationships that were not evident to me when they were occurring. Provided good insights into the personalities and suspicions of our leaders.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Head and shoulders above Divergent. Some plot twists are obvious, but the character development is strong and the book is funny and also a bit of a love letter to New York.  A nice and quick read.
B000002L6P|5.0|I was a teenager in the 80's this was one of my favorite albums that I bought if you are a fan of the 80's or if your now listening to the music from the 80's this is a great album to add to your collection. Madonna is a very talented singer
B000Q79HS8|4.0|It's hard to distinguish one Bourne film from the others in the series, but perhaps that is unnecessary as they all guarantee non-stop action with flamboyant special effects. The staged moves in the fight scenes are well-plotted and seem very real. Nice entertainment, but be sure to shut your door to contain the loud sound effects. All done with little or no blood scenes.<br /><br />Harold J. Diamond
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the way the story unfolded from beginning to end. Reflected in you left us with what seemed an insurmountable challenge in Eva and Gideon's relationship. I loved the way that Sylvia Day strengthened their bond and relationship in this book. Their relationship became more strong as they work through  things together and confided in one another rather than insecurities. The characters are even more self-aware; realistic. She dove deeper and revealed more about Gideon's past and how his traumatizing events transpired. For those that have a problem with the interaction of Eva and Brett, at no point in time did Come across as her leading him on or playing with anyone's emotions. Eva's character was clear in that she cared for Brett and he played an important part  at one point and time in her life but that does not equate to the love / being in love with Gideon.<br /> The ending does leave you hanging but I personally feel the characters and story could not be ended well in one book. I look forward to how their story unfolds further.
140006922X|5.0|The 1 star reviews are absurd.  It's just a bunch of Christian zealots who have been watching too much Fox News.  Need to temper and balance the idiocy.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|One of the best of the Clancy genre.  The cyberwarfare  sequences are frighteningly believable. I think too much detail was in some of the dogfight sequences, but did not take away from the very readable novel.
B009EE5SQ4|5.0|Yes, another alien invasion.  But this time it's Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, along with a great supporting cast, terrific special effects and very moving music.  If you're one of the few who hasn't seen it yet, it's coming out in a re-release in 3D that should be interesting.  I own this, watch it periodically and will be in the theaters to see the 3D version.<br /><br />So, take a chance and give it a view.
B005544TRQ|3.0|The young apprentice genius doesn't completely pull off the genius role. Harvey, his boss, is too pretty boy and also doesn't quite pull off his tough guy role. Still it's an enjoyable show just not great.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Truly an amazing person and a must read for everyone.  I switched to Apple products after I read the book.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|Great actors wasted in a formulaic film.  Boring story line plus I thought there would be much more of India.  Really, it could have been filmed anywhere.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|It's quite the twister and quite the epic fantasy, it's a fantastic mix of the two. I really, really liked it and I truly hope more will follow.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|My friend had been bugging me to read this book for a year, but I kept putting it off. Big mistake. Couldn't put it down after I downloaded it.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Pull out the popcorn and spend some quality time with the family.  The story line's  lesson is good for the young and old alike.  Enjoy!
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|This product is a good idea, but wouldn't even pan out for a 49-er. The method is sound but extremely difficult to obtain Items as pictured. It ended up being a complete waste of my time, a complete waste of my money and now it's wasting space in the closet where i chucked it to get it out of my sight. i do not know what to even do with this thing now, because it does not work as advertised. You literally would have to be Harry Houdini to make this contraption perform and even then, it would be an optical illusion. Save your money! Don't waste it here.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This movie has something for everyone! The story was done quick nicely with lots of action. And who can resist a princess being rescued! Great movie for the young and the old.
B009I0QTF8|5.0|&#34;Until the Quiet Comes&#34;....I was ready for this album the moment the video came out (if you haven't seen that, SEE IT). Trippy vocals, pounding drums, a variety of themes...this album has it all!  I commend FlyLo for going the artistic route in his music, as imo many Black musicians just perform the cookie cutter role and leave it at that.  We need more musicians who are going to break the mold and try something different!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This angry birds android app is exactly the same as the free version of the game but does not have ads with it.
B00B1LN8WY|2.0|No matter what Warner Bros releases for t.v. sets, they can never get it right or praise to the fan base. For me , I will no longer support Warner Bros products.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I ordered 2 of these for myself & my daughter.I'll start off by saying we both love John Fogerty & CCR.  I loved every song & the artists that performed with him. My daughter did also.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is really cool ; I hope they take more games of these. they put almost every shark in the game the great white is really cool!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved playing this game too bad there are not as many levels I beat them all and now have to wait for more levels
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The plots are a little \\"soap opera ish\\" but still entertaining. There are story lines for the aristocrats and another set for the servants. So you get two shows for every performance. Love watching the old clothes,trains,autos and architecture. The countryside scenery is beautiful as well. The characters were well cast with just one exception I won't mention by name because it might just be me.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|+ve<br />Low price<br />Seamless YouTube and Netflix streaming.<br />-ve<br />Sometime Netflix app hangs on iOS device and so you loose control on it. Restarting Netflix app on your iOS device will not help either. (I hope Netflix will fix it soon)<br />Streaming of any flash video from Chrome browser  on Windows 7  does not work properly. It hangs , skips audio and sometime plays it on slow motion.<br />So in my opinion this would be last device for anyone trying to stream flash video.<br />--Update 07/31/2013--<br />After reducing the quality of Cast (from cast button options in Chrome browser) I am able to stream flash video from Chrome browser  on Windows 7(WiFi G). I will try it again with best quality settings after upgrading my wifi network to WiFi N.<br /><br />Due to this new finding I have increased my rating to 3 stars.Still not convinced to give it more than that because of following -ve<br />To play flash or any other stuff from Chrome browser you have to keep it running on your PC as well. So effectively in this case Chromecast is just replacing HDMI cable.<br />No volume control on Youtube and real bad forward / backward options.<br />I feel it is a half baked product and get better in future.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is fun but I had to delete it a couple of times because it was gliching out on me
B0063IH60K|4.0|I Love to play solitaire and so does my husband.  We like to play it a lot when we travel.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I ordered wrong item.  This does not fit my Kindle Fire HD.  I now have a very nice kindle holder but no Kindle that will fit it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game, but haven't had a chance to play it much.  Will play it more in the future.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I took a leap into the game without reading anything about it and found it super easy to understand. Basically you just sling across trying to get gems and bananas. So far I haven't seen anything else but I've only played a few levels. I can't say I love this game but I could easily find myself playing it for half an hour or longer and be pretty entertained.
0307279189|5.0|Book arrived as promised and my husband just finished reading it.  Cant wait to have my turn with the book now that he is done.
B00AK57N00|5.0|This is the perfect little game for when you're waiting in an elevator, in a line, or just plain bored. The game mechanisms are super simple and once you get started, you'll see that the game does become more difficult. Anybody could easily pick up this game and be entertained.
034580404X|5.0|Working on reading the 3rd book in the series now.  So far love them all and the books arrived as promised.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great movie. Look forward to next one. Actors are great and it is funny! Don' t pass this one up
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A must read for any runner. One of the best non-fiction books, I've read. I found physical and spiritual motivation to run.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|This movie was very enjoyable.  It is set in a home for Retired Musicians.  There is music everywhere.  We start the movie as the residents are planning the annual gala to try to get money to keep the home open.  During this time there is a rumor that anew \\"star\\" will be arriving.  This is significant as three of the residents are members of a quartet and the new resident is the fourth member.  There is some conflict as she was also the ex-wife of one of the men.  I felt that this was a sweet movie and it featured something you don't see much of \\"older actors\\"  I felt the Dustin Hoffman did a good job directing.  The bonus materials were interesting.  But believe it or not my favorite part were the credits as there showed the actors in before and after shots.  They were mostly real musicians that had quite distinguished careers.  If you are looking for a movie that is sweet and funny then this will fill the bill.  There is a bit of language so not suitable for children.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love love love this series!  The characters are great, the sets are awesome and the story lines keep you interested.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I love the original series, so I knew i would enjoy this one.  It has far surpassed my expectations.  Love the plot, characters and story!  Just wish it had been longer than 5 seasons.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Pure awesome every one should play this game, very good, with the heart a and essence of th  minions, good job
B00AYB1KHW|5.0|Great story, great characters, great cast and real fear. It doesn't get much better. I highly recommend this movie to horror fans.
B0060D10I2|5.0|We loved the movie and purchased in on the Amazon cloud. We had purchased it once before from Walmart but my grant child has it.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Great movie for a 3D home theatre and a good movie for the kids.  There aren’t too many good 3D movies out there and this is one of the good ones!
B005U9RE1Y|5.0|An oldie but a goodie, from 1986, the fourth film for Ms. Connelly but you can tell she was a star in the making.<br />A wonderful Henson tale, he is missed.
B00B4804KS|5.0|For most of the movie you couldn't tell that it was redone in 3D.  The scenes were well done and the 3D was fantastic.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The first 200 pages sucked and were useless. The last 150 pages were really good. The writing style in this novel and the previous novel was very different from the other books that flowed so much better. It just seemed like this book was written by someone else. I'm glad the series has ended. It's worth reading only because I've read all the other novels in this series.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|i had actually read some of the reviews that were mentioning the ending was not satisfactory but took my chances since the first two books were captivating. I should havd saved both my time and money,this was such a bust. This was not even an ending. It was like the author was preparing to draw the book and series to a well desered close an instead got lazy at the end, and decided to quit writing and just threw in a helpful recommendation to the reader (life lesson) to finalize this series.<br /><br />Honestly knowing how this series ends, I would probably never started reading it in the first place. One final criticism, the Solomon story was so unoriginal it was painful. Painfully disappointing finale to an otherwise great series that unfortunately cannot stand on its own without the finale to make it all complete.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|So far I've cooked rice -- not instant, the real thing--, and pancakes with this stove, and it performs great.  I've not yet filled it to the full mark and each time still had fuel left over after I was done cooking.  Highly reccomend it!

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I really, really enjoy this show. I simply enjoy the storyline and the chemistry that all the characters have with each other. I can't get enough of this show!!
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|loves this she is 3 and it is a great great Disney story with wonderful graphics and storyline. Always like anything with Tom Hanks.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I obtained this used version - fully prepared for some scratches and nicks on the cover or something.  It is just like new for a used price.  AWESOME!
B0094M2ODQ|4.0|i did like it, felt it was entertaining, not necessarily a great classic but just plain good entertainment. ya know what i mean?
034580404X|5.0|So Glad I Got The Trilogy Instead Of Purchasing The Books Separately, Great Deal And The Books Leave You Wanting More.!
B00CS7ZIHI|1.0|Rather disappointed in this release... reminded me more of a movie sound track than a typical 30 seconds to mars EP.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was a veary good game and i just unlocked trickey today this is a veary good game extra words
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Usually not one for games but this one is GREAT!!!!!!!!! Actually gets my mind going and focused! I recommend this game for people ( and children ) of all ages!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is an exciting escape game that I ever found. I highly recommend this game to people interested in escape games. I encouraged my wife to play and she loves it too.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm a gadget junkie. I already have a Vizio Co-Star, a Roku 2 and numerous smart TVs and Blu-Ray players. So streaming content is not all that new to me but I had to buy the Chromecast because it seemed so simple and open. After playing with it for a few days, it's well worth the $35 price tag and will likely become my default streamer of Netflix and YouTube.<br /><br />Most people now have a smartphone and/or tablet and usually have them within reach at all times. As much as I love my Co-Star, it's yet another clunky remote I have to grab for to utilize it to the max. The Roku remote is small but any searches are a pain in the backside. The Netflix interfaces on my other streaming devices are all stripped down and awful.<br /><br />The simplicity of the Chromecast is why people are going crazy over it. Grab your phone, tablet or computer and you can instantly stream to the device for the official apps or websites. As long as you have a decent router, there's almost no lag from when you input commands into your phone/tablet and when it happens on the screen. Picture is in big beautiful 1080p. The fact that the device can be operated Android and iOS is a butter, as my wife has iPhone and I have Nexus 4. My wife also hates learning how to use my new gadgets, but she learned how to use the Chromecast in about 2 minutes and is happy to bury the Roku & Co-Star remotes out of sight.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, this won't replace other streaming boxes until developers update their apps, but Google is making it pretty simple for them. But for me, I use Netflix and YouTube 95% of the time on my streaming boxes, so this will become my go to device.<br /><br />If this was $75, I'd give it 4 stars because of the lack of other services out the box, but at $35, it's a 5-star pickup and a no-brainer. I ordered two and may order some at work as this will be a nice way to show off my companies YouTube videos or show presentations during meetings without lugging a laptop around or having wires sprawled across the conference room table.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is an excellent game!<br /><br />This game is simple to learn and easy to play.  With only a 16 card deck, each round plays fast and keeps everyone involved.  It only took a couple practice rounds for everyone in my family to learn the game.  Even my 6 year old who is starting to learn how to read, can play because he has memorized the cards.<br /><br />Best played with 3 or 4 players.  I would recommend getting card protector sleeves to keep the game lasting a long time.  We've already played about 50 games over the week and without the sleeves I could see the cards getting bent and worn pretty quickly.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this game!
140006922X|5.0|Great read!<br /><br />He states on page two that he is a Muslim and gives his biography.<br /><br />There is no religious bias at all in the book; it is a work of history with 100s of endnotes and 1000s of sources.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|I would frequently see only 3000 mhz using CPU-Z. I tried disabling different combinations of turbo core, C1E, LLC, etc. Nothing helped. Lots of other users apparently have had this issue (at least according to the forums I was researching). I tried almost all night with no luck.

0804165734|5.0|I'm not sure I will see the movie, because I think this excellent book would have made a better mini series. I find it hard to see how an oral history could really be a movie...we'll see.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|Had some laughs, don't think it lived up to all the promos I've seen.  Some rough language, 1 topless seen.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|Not only allows you to build army, it also build castle and siege catapults!<br />Also love the brown horses and minifig accessories
B0011N1WE8|2.0|The plot of Penelope is standard fairy tale material -- thanks to a curse, a privileged young girl is born with the features of a pig, and can not be cured until she is loved by \\"one of her own kind.\\" Her parents try to arrange a marriage for her; she falls for a commoner; they hide from the press until Penelope decides to break free. In the end, everybody gets more or less what they deserve.<br /><br />What's good about this movie? Fascinating cast from top to bottom, great camera work, some crisp and amusing dialog. I was particularly fond of Peter Dinkledge as the journalist who is both driven to uncover photos of the deformed girl and sympathetic to her plight. Perhaps as a dwarf he is uniquely aware that physical oddities ought not define one's life and normality does not guarantee happiness, but the script never has his character spell this out and the resulting portrayal is perhaps the most interesting in the film. He's funny too. Some of the original plot elements worked well (the public's embrace of Penelope once she presents herself, and the crowds of young women in Penelope masks for Halloween in particular).<br /><br />What's bad? Unfortunately, that's a longer list. Penelope is supposed to be so grotesque that every man who sees her tries to jump out a window to escape. Yet she is played by Christina Ricci, looking entirely lovely except for her pig nose. She is also feisty, smart, and educated, and the premise that all men flee her fails because she is so obviously desirable. Ricci's acting is curiously flat. The tone of her narration, in particular, seems disconnected with the life experience of the character.<br /><br />The film seeks to condemn superficiality, and yet embraces it too (spoiler -- Ricci gets a normal nose before the end). The shallowness of Catherine O'Hara's character was brutal and borderline mysogynistic. The reliance on magic was cheap and weakened the film, especially the butler's pointless final scene. The use of accents was bizarre. The story seems to be set in London, but none of the Americans in the cast bother with English accents and some of the Brits in the cast sport American accents. There is no consistency and the effect is of a production that had gotten away from the director. Richard E. Grant is almost entirely wasted. The ending is dissatisfying. Penelope should have kept the nose and entered politics.arre.

0812983459|5.0|I couldn't put the book down from the first page on. A very interesting tale of one man's journey to &#34;help&#34; his friend of years past.<br />Harold goes out to mail a letter one day and keeps walking . He leaves his dreary life, and hits the open road. His quest to keep his old friend alive keeps him on the road through many hard times. The story tells of the many people he meets on the way and gives way to many interesting story lines. He is revitalized at many times as he has plenty of time to reflect on his life. The story has a unexpected turn of events that is very surprising. Very well written, and keeps your attention the whole way.
B00DU74U74|4.0|The actors were great and I enjoyed the story. I think some people were expecting Twilight so they didn't go see it, but The Host is very different from Twilight.
B005FFW46S|4.0|I'm a fan of the Discworld books, and this was a fun bedtime read, I would probably recommend it to all fans of fun reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome. not as good as computer version but it is still awesome. make sure to look for updates.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|A must-see movie, entertaining, and worth watching multiple times, especially if you enjoy super hero movies. It helps to have seen the previous movies for the back story.
B000RHLY8I|5.0|This movie is awesome. Nick Cage does some of his best smug and arrogant acting. Not a family friendly film.
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|I have been programming for a little while now (mostly web development, javascript, php, and ruby) and this is my first book I've read on C and it was great. It doesn't just show you how to write in C but it also explains a lot about programing in general, if you read it that way. Definitely a book every programmer should pick up.
B00633W614|4.0|I can't wait to complete the Clifton Chronicle series.  I will also be looking into more novels by Jeffrey Archer.
140006922X|5.0|This is a well-researched and compellingly thoughtful analysis of Jesus of Nazareth. Important reading for anyone who is interested in understanding the impact of cultural context on religion.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I didn't think I could finish this book but I did. I knew little about North Korea before I read this fictional coming of age story of Jun Do and his cohorts. Divided into two parts, the novel is set in the rural confines of prison life, mines and hard labor camps of North Korea for the first chapter. The second chapter is set in the modern city of Pyongyang, the seat of government of the mostly repressive and dictatorial regime of Kim Jong Il. A lot of the narrative shifts from the many points of view of the regime officers and the points of view of the major characters, which left me to wonder who was talking and why there were abrupt changes going on?<br /><br />The reader is taken to the hardship and horror of living in an orphanage and difficult living situations in camps called divisions. Jun Do, the main character is the son of the orphan master and he is given harder and more excruciating tasks by his father. Amongst other orphans, Jun Do has to forage for food, work in slave like conditions enduring biting cold and searing heat. He ends up on spy fishing boats and meets unscrupulous characters, mostly militia performing kidnappings. All kinds of repressive actions that portray the lawlessness and wanton disregard for human rights and life in general are vividly imagined. Families get torn apart from each other, children are molested, women are raped, errant men tortured. This is the dystopia  of The Democratic Republic of North Korea.<br /><br />I was pretty traumatized by how in their prison camps everone was subject to severe torture, inmates can be incarcerated for any odd reasons, from speaking to foreigners, eating carp from a pond, or generally being a disloyal citizen to their Dear Leader and the State. Punishment and being sentenced to harsh conditions like being banished in tunnels and dark dwelling areas are carefully written to leave images of man's inhumanity to his fellow men. Inmates were interrogated, beaten, even lobotomized in the most gruesome way. People's individuality and sense of identity were totally taken away from them. Husbands can be taken away from their wives, replacements are easily substituted. I also paid particular attention to foodstuff that impoverished North Koreans ate to survive: bitter rose hips, flowers, small birds, moths, fish roe, millet, goats and animal blood. These images of orphans and families eating were viscerally revolting and it made me very angry. Johnson teeters to the bizarre and the dark side in describing how people are nonchalant about inflicting various degrees of pain on one another.<br /><br />The second chapter introduces the love interest of Jun Do, Sun Moon, a famous actress and cultural icon of the repressive culture. She was the wife of Commander Ga, who supposedly was Kim Jong Il's nemesis. Jun Do killed Commander Ga and became Sun Moon's husband as he assumes his identity. The couple orchestrate a defection to the US that leaves the reader in total suspense the whole time.<br /><br />On the many levels this book can be appreciated, I marveled at how the layers of politics, existential angst, US diplomacy, human rights violations, propaganda, love and sacrifice, family relationships were explored in this book.  It scares me that this fictional account unveils a country that is going through these human rights violations as currently as today!some way.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this. Have had no problems with using it and the weather is  accurate. I also like the extra things,for example, I have respiratory problems and the program tells me how the weather will affect me. That helps me plan for the day.
B0084AZXKK|1.0|I hated this book because it was hard to under stand what it is all about because of the weird words that they say
B0089LOG02|4.0|Moving and inspiring, loved it! Thought the connection between foster children and orphans on the train was done so well.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|ANY SONG!! Heck I got songs that would have cost me 5 bucks!<br />Only bad part is there are a billion remixes when you search for stuff.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a fun, interesting book to read.  I liked the plot and the characters.  I like John Grisham's books, and while some are definitely than others, I would recommend this one.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a great way to show that you should be happy with what you have, because you never know when it's going to be taken away.  Powerful writing and a very honest voice from each of the characters.
140006922X|5.0|There seems to be a lot of negative reviews on here by people who have not even read the book. Which is unfortuanate because I cannot see how the authors religion matters. It should be judged by its content which I havent seen any of the negative reviews do. Its a well written, interesting book & definitely worth reading before coming to a conclusion on its merits.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a really long time.  I didn't want it to end.  I understand why Hollywood wanted to make it a movie.  Powerful.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I could hardly put the book down. I felt I had an inside view of a quadriplegic. The relationship between the characters was so honest and open.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the absolute best set of books I have read in a long long time!  Starting with Book 1 I was totally hooked and could not put it down.  I read the second book in a few days and third about the same.  I didn't want it to end and was so happy to hear they will be making it into a movie next year.  I was intrigued with the twists and turns this writer took us through that kept us on the edge of our seats anticipating what would happen next between Christian and Ana.  Love stories are my favorite read and this one did not disappoint.  I look forward to readinjg more from E L  James.  Thank you!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was impossible for Hosseini  to top his first two books....this was readable and realistic, but it did not impact me like his<br />earlier efforts.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This half was a little more confusing on how they blended the old series together, but once I wrapped my head around it I enjoyed it. This fills holes that were in the series and added some new quirks that made it even more interesting than the old series.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|Great 40th anniversary edition of this iconic martial arts masterpiece. A nice upgrade in picture & sound will keep fans very happy. Some interesting new extras & fun packaging make this a must. Buy with confidence.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I think this entry in the Jack Reacher series may be a bit polarizing, as it features a different side of Reacher - less brawn, more brain.  One of the conventions used by the author to \\"control\\" the brawn is confining Reacher to a car, where he uses his mental skills to deduce that the situation isn't what it seems and gives us some insight into his love of facts and numbers - some useful, some not.  This is a departure for most Reacher novels - and don't get me wrong, I love it when he unleashes his considerable brawn on someone deserving of some whoopass - but I enjoyed this different take, too.<br /><br />And, as for action, yes, most of it comes at the end.  But it's paired with a puzzle - a virtual maze of a missile silo that requires a lot of thought to maneuver through.  That can be tedious for some readers; for me, it just built the suspense.  A startling death close to the storming of the castle wakes the reader up for the action and also provides further insight into Reacher's character.<br /><br />I do admit that the resolution of the mystery component of the book was a little bit of a letdown, but it had so little to do with the arc of the novel - which is as much a character study as it is an action-driven adventure - that it didn't bother me.<br /><br />Oh, and Reacher's deadpan humor remains:  When he is sawing with a motel key at a captive's rope bindings. \\"Don't you have a knife?\\" the man asks. \\"I have a toothbrush,\\" Reacher responds. \\"That won't help,\\" the captive says, to which Reacher retorts: \\"It's good against plaque.\\"<br /><br />I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment.
B00DGKQ5I2|5.0|We Came As Romans is back with their new album Tracking Back Roots. This album is awesome just as good as the other albums, the new songs and lyrics are really catchy and great, I really like this album from start to finish. May favorite songs are fade away, I survive, never let me go, tell me now. Keep up the good music WCAR!
0425264386|4.0|I have read all of the Reacher series, not always in order.  But I did start consecutively with numbers 1-5, and I felt that this book really built on the first and elevated Reacher to a new status in action-focused fiction.  I can't believe that I - an almost 50 year-old woman - would enjoy reading the details about weapons and military history and combat strategies so much.  But, I definitely did.  As an author, I really appreciate Mr. Child's ability to make stories appealing to both men and women - a relatively rare skill.<br /><br />In this book, I also appreciated the presence of a strong female protagonist.  Despite being in significant pain during the course of the novel, Holly remained cool-headed, creative, willing to take advice but follow her own direction, capable, determined...wow.  That was nice to see in a book with a larger-than-life male lead.<br /><br />As for Reacher, I think he really comes into his own in this book, and we start to get a glimpse into the components of his make-up.  Certainly we see what he's capable of, and we see his ability to isolate emotion (Wait, does he have any?  Why, yes.  Yes, he does.) when he needs to.  He is a soldier at heart - a well-trained, smarter-than average, resourceful and very skilled soldier, but it's at the core of who he is, and that's never lost in the books.<br /><br />There were some times when a suspension of disbelief was required - the timing of the kidnap, Reacher being kept \\"in the game\\" for as long as he was - but that's true in almost any book, and certainly in many in this genre.  It was no problem for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed this read.  Recommended.
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|The game is great the controls are really tuff the further up the levels you go. Sometimes I get so frustrated when im having a difficult time flying under control and then I remember that's how the game is suppose to be. Reason for a 4not 5 star because I think I did better on some of the maps than I was given credit for of course that's just my opinion lol. Great job
B007VUA7VO|3.0|This is a good app.  T just let you know you current usage.  For free t give you what you need.  Would recommend this app
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I received a digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review from NetGalley.<br /><br />This was the first book I have read by Jojo Moyes. I am definitely going to look into what other books she has written.<br /><br />This story is about Louisa who is better known as Lou. Lou struggles living at home with: her mom and dad, her sister, Treena, Treena's very young son, Thomas and her grandfather. The home is crowded but income is limited and Lou and Treena are depended on to help the family financially.<br /><br />This big family are tightly packed into their small home, but are, for the most part, loving. There was one thing that irked my nerves a little bit and that was the way Lou's father spoke to her at times. Still, the author still manages to convey that his remarks are not meant to be malicious and that he is really only teasing Lou, but sometimes his comments came off as mean spirited.<br /><br />At first, Lou is perfectly content working in a cafe and seeing her boyfriend, Patrick.  However, the cafe closes and the family is panicked at the loss of income. After awhile, through a job placement agency, Lou is employed by the Traynor family as a caregiver to their son, Will.<br /><br />Will is a victim of a tragic accident that left him a quadriplegic. He has an assistant that comes in to help him with physical therapy and other medical needs, but Will's mother wants Lou to be more of a companion to Will, who is suffering from depression. There's more to that part of the story, but I am not going to spoil it for you.<br /><br /> I really got hooked on it towards the end. The author did such a good job that when I had to put it down, I felt like I couldn't wait to get back to it...almost like I had people waiting that I couldn't wait to catch up with and see how they were.<br /><br />Heavy at times, humorous at others, I found this to be a great read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book has it all.  There's action, tension, mystery, and good charaters.  I would get disappointed when the author switched to the point of view of another character at the end of a chapter. By the end of that chapter, I was irritated because I wanted to know what happened next!  This happened at the end of nearly every chapter.<br /><br />This book is dark, but not in the same sense as The Road which has been called soul devouringly bleak.  There is a lot of hope in this book despite the fact that it occurs underground in yet another post apocalyptic America.<br /><br />Also, $5.99 for 5 books?  You can't lose!<br /><br />I bought Shift before I even finished Wool and it's already got me hooked.  I'm only 20% in, but I think it may already be a superior book.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|an amazing revelation of a terrible abused society by its leaders!!!!  how this can exist in our open communication world...
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|It is great watching for the whole family. it really shows what and how a mindless community can be like though.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This item was listed on Amazon that it would work on my Cruz tablet ingenic T301 10. My tablet will not recognize this app. Dont waste your time. I do have Android version 2.2 installed
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|It's not an epic but still Funny, serious, even corny at times. Thin plot but good acting. Worth the rental. I was surprised by the decent acting.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Well written and documented with interesting, appropriate stories to support the author's contentions. I especially enjoyed lessons on how to avoid being euchred by Takers. These \\"life applications\\" have helped me set some important boundaries. Also, he walks the talk in responding personally to a comment I made. I will reread this book.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Started watching season half way thru, so it was great to go back and find out how it started. Good series.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|After watching 3 seasons of GOT s, I decided to read the books, I'm on vol. 2 A Song Of Fire and Ice, I'm enjoying the books very much. I download them to my Kindle and Ipad . Amazon and Kindle is great.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  It made me cry throughout, & I'm 56 years old!!!<br />Very sweet & uplifting.  Great for all ages!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|More long-time groups need to release this type of DVD.  We truly enjoyed seeing the past clips and words of Don, Glen, and the rest of the band.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset. The software was easy to install. The sound quality is comparable to my bose headset that I use for music/movies. The wireless battery seems to last a long time, and the computer warns you when you are running low. I would recommend this headset to any gamer.

B0064X7FVE|3.0|Loved the app before the latest version. Now I find it difficult to navigate. It may just a learning curve but the maps are difficult to manipulate and I am having trouble finding videos for my area.
B00AQ2G7D6|3.0|But, I think the second edition with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo is a better film.  The two films are different in respectively interesting ways, including the endings which make both versions worth watching.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this from start to finish. I would put this in the same category with the Bourne movies.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great series. Was a little hard to get into it at first but hang in there because it will keep you wanting to read more.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Bought cord to charge my kindle fire, it also charges my cell.. I can use it in my cars usb port.Nice and convient

B004LM72ZY|4.0|This kind of toy is very fun to every small children. It is simple to play with it and does not have small parts that can be a danger.<br />My 3 years old play a lot with it.<br />It is not complex to let his little mind to create great adventures and can be really playable.<br />Something important is that children can put a figure inside and is very easy to open, It's very intuitive to use.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Being a fan of the first Evil Dead, second, and Army of Darkness you can enjoy this as long as you don't have false expectations.<br /><br />Most of the one and two star reviews are people upset that it was a bad remake.  But was it meant to be?  Bruce Campbell did not intend for this to be viewed as a \\"remake\\", rather it should be viewed as a new Evil Dead.  Should they have named it Evil Dead 5?  It's been over thirty years now since Evil Dead was in theaters, do people really think they were going to remake it with the same script and cheesy special effects?  Have you seen what Bruce has been up to in the last couple of decades?  His IMDb reads like a list of movies I wouldn't watch on an 18 hour flight if it was all I had.<br /><br />He decided that instead of try another comical remake, to go at it sincerely with amazing special effects, both CGI and prosthetic.  Not to mention the innovative camera work.  Sure the plot is pretty thin, but can you really say any great horror movie has a very robust plot?  The Exorcist, girl gets possessed and her mom does all she can to help her.  Psycho, crazy cross-dresser kills people.  Rear Window, curious photographer witnesses a murder in an apartment.  For me, the plot was enough, and just that.  There's always the struggle in any horror to carry a story, but still maintain suspense.  Too much of either doesn't work well.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I still can't get past Level 65.  It is a waste of time thought.  It is good that it is free.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read that has some very interesting insights on the habits of humans. Read it when you get a chance.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Streaming is so easy and fun especially watching classics from years gone by.<br />Nice watching with no commercials! My kids like watching these episodes, too.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Although this movie has been out a long time, I missed it...but, it was well worth the wait. If you haven't seen it, you should relax tonight and watch. You won't be disappointed.
B004G8Y0D0|5.0|All around very entertaining movie.  I was a fan of the TV series and they upped this about 25 x.  Great cast, great plot and outstanding script.  Of course, the 5th star is for Jessica Biel.  Yep.  Does a great supporting job in this pic too !!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like it because it relaxes me, but it isn't very challenging since you can reshuffle as many times as you want to finish matching the tiles, but when I want to &#34;zone out&#34; it is great. kept me occupied on several long flights.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Surprisingly good and fast paced. Great cast of characters who played believable roles. There was a tiny bit of gore but that goes along with the violence of the movie. Not too bad or stomach turning. My husband and I both liked it a lot. There was a good bit of humor, too.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Do yourself a favor and don't spoil the ending for yourself.  I could not put this one down! The &#34;look back&#34; style really kept me  intrigued.  So many good novels are still predictable.  This one will be tough to top.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Overall, I really like this alarm clock. It has been very reliable. Has lots of different melodies to choose from, or you can use one of your own songs. It was a little difficult to figure out, but I was super sleepy, so it could've just been me. =)
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This collection will get you hooked on the Crawley family and the side stories of staff members.  I am in love with this series!

B0018J2QB8|5.0|Great entertaining show.  I'm addicted.  I began watching season 7 during regular season and am now getting caught up on past seasons.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|In the excessive pages of introductory material in the intro and the chapter for the first exercise, the author manages to caricature and insult Christianity and blaspheme Christ dozens of times, and tries to get you to be in a receptive enough state of mind to \\"notice\\" the results you're supposed to get in the exercises. If you're familiar with Tony Robbins at all, you'll know right away that all this is doing is conditioning your reticular activating system to look for ANYTHING that MIGHT SORTA KINDA be a result, and to amplify its significance (analogous to counting anything burgundy-colored in a room as red while you're looking around a room for red things).<br /><br />While I'm a committed Christian, I'm open to learning about truth from lots of different world views, and I feel that I am able to re-contextualize truths I find so that they make sense to me within my network of presuppositions about life and the world and still benefit me, bringing to light things I would otherwise overlook in my own context. So I bought this book knowing that I wouldn't necessarily agree with everything in it, but thinking that I was open-minded enough to at least try an exercise or two--perhaps with slightly different terminology and structures in my mind--since so many people seem to have had quite a bit of success with the law of attraction and related ideas in New Thought literature. What I found instead was an absolute dud of a first exercise (no results whatsoever even though I was GENUINELY open to them), and a bunch of insults to my faith. I understand if someone wants to disagree with what I believe, but to caricature a major world religion that has plenty written about it so that people don't HAVE to caricature it when they critique it (or for that matter when they just blandly rail against it without argumentation as in this work), and make a mockery of its core tenets, in a book that sophistically (read: not sophisticatedly, but SOPHISTICALLY) claims to be all-embracing and boundary-transcending when it comes to differing world religions and the way they think about God or the Divine or a transcendent Power...is less than charitable, scholarly, civil, or honest.<br /><br />Why is it that when people have a beef with traditional religions in general, unless it's a piece on extremist Islam or something, it is always aimed against Christianity? Maybe it's because there's a real spiritual war going on, and maybe the death of Jesus really fulfilled Isaiah 53 (written ~500BC or earlier), and maybe He really rose from the dead bodily, and maybe He really is reigning from heaven now, progressively conquering the demonic forces behind the evil and unbelief in this world.<br /><br />And maybe His death meant, far from coldly transcending and being uninvolved and impersonally related with the suffering and evil in this world, the living and personal God, Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has definitively conquered evil and death by subjecting Himself to it in the person of the Son. Maybe the poor and starving of the world don't just need to think more positively or ask the universe to do their autonomous bidding, but need to know and trust the One who is intimately involved, working even the hard things for ultimate good. Acts 2:23-24; 4:27-28; Romans 8:28; Genesis 50:20.<br /><br />I realize this review will probably not get very good ratings, and will probably entice some interesting comments from people with contrary views (which I will not interact with here...I find those discussions less than helpful normally on the internet). \\"Just another ignorant, unenlightened, stone-age, fundamentalist Christian looney...ignore him...he'll 'wake up' some day.\\" Just remember that truth has not often been successfully determined by groupthink or popularity contests...
B00CWEQ62S|5.0|I am a big fan of graphic novels with a major story line.  This series hits that mark.  Now I just need to read the novels, lol!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|What a crazy book! I am glad I finished it, but I came close to quitting on a few occasions.
B0080SSYUW|4.0|This excellent, though most of the stories were very removed and distant, told in a third-person omniscient perspective that didn't really connect well. The last two stories, however, Quiet Haven and Funny Boy were the best of the bunch, had much great emotional impact.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is getting me in a lot of trouble!  I'm being threatened with seeing my shrink!  I'm pulling my hair out and  screaming at my kindle all because this silly little Minion just won't listen to me and then has the of NERVE to turn around and LAUGH me ... And the jumping Jack's?  Let me tell you what, I threw my kindle out the window into the back yard and now my DOG is having a NERVOUS breakdown!  BUY IT ... I need company in the psychic ward Chasing these little yellow guys in blue coveralls
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The show is really great, the relation between the characters is one of the best things of the show. The magic and all the new characters that appear every season makes this show just fantastic.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a scholar, I judge a claim's credibility by the fact that it presents. Aslan did a great job presenting arguments based on credible findings. I find it mindblowing that he presented another side of Jesus and how political he was. I am also a non-believer and knowing this other side of Jesus challenges my non-beliefs and develops a different kind of respect towards whom a lot of people called the messiah/savior, etc, which I've been skeptical about for a long time.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The best trilogy of a superheroe. A great begin give you the keys to understand every aspect of the personality of Batman. The second gives a great villan, the joker, who makes batman reach their limits. Finally a great movi to end this trilogy.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|This is a very handy app. to have especially when you are just starting out and need to know how to correctly do the exercises. The video's have timers so you know what you have done and what you have left to complete. The app. allows you to target one area or do a full body workout.
B009K45Y62|5.0|This movie is magnific, a great work of a people who really like batman. The movie makes you feel afraid, interested and finally give you a great end.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Very fun game, I found myself playing it whenever I had a spare moment. It has several levels that you can complete.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|The first season got me way more involved. Still love it! Evan peters is always good and I love the cast. But still can't shake the first season!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This is very handy whether you are looking for a basic calculator or want something much more. This calculator has the ability to accomplish that.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Interesting plot that follows the discovery instincts of children and the imaginatio.  Interesting for children and for parents. Excellent internet streaming quality.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|The kids love playing with this app. I like that you can save your art and use it as wallpaper
B005LAII12|3.0|The product showed up quickly and we are really looking forward to watching it, but hoepfully it works.  The DVD case was busted and there were pieces falling off of it, the disc looks good, but hopefully there are no problems.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars...what an amazing book! I cried through much of the story, even at the funny parts! These characters seemed so real you can't help but fall in love with them and feel exactly what they feel. I finished this book in a day, i just couldn't put it down! A must read!!
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|I find it very interesting to see a FAOTD with no previous reviews. It's like a hidden gem just waiting to be found, but it's also a little bit risky considering you're just going off of looks and permissions. However, I think this game has a good amount of potential.    First of all, the game concept is incredibly simple: Get the bunnies home and earn stars! You do this by giving the bunnies commands using the buttons on the bottom of the screen, such as walk, stop, and dig. In addition to those commands, there are four other buttons to note:    - Fast forward - double the speed of the bunnies (very useful for the impatient, as these bunnies are slow)  - Pause - pause the game  - Hints - You are given 10 base hints initially, and every three stars you earn gets you another hint to use.  - Lightning - Kills a bunny if it gets stuck for some reason    At the end of each level, you earn points for every bunny that successfully makes it to the bunny home. During the level, there are vegetables to be collected that can earn you extra points. If you get enough points,  three stars are yours, and you get that extra hint in addition to unlocking more levels and, eventually, more worlds!    I've compressed my previous edits here because it was getting long and redundant. Here is a general list of patterns I've noticed for getting a certain number of stars per level, based on the experiences I've had while playing today:    - You get one star for getting most if not all of the bunnies to the home but don't get all the vegetables.    - You get two stars for collecting all the vegetables and a majority of the bunnies bunnies home.    - You get three stars for collecting all the vegetables and getting all of the bunnies home (or all but one or two, depending on how many bunnies there are in a level).    At the beginning of each level, you are given a short visual introduction of any new information concerning the current level you are on. This includes things like introducing new commands, showing you what a sign means, and giving you initial hints to get you on the right track. In addition, there is a more in-depth tutorial in the options menu, which gives you visual as well as written descriptions of everything.    Now, although this game is pretty fun and the bunnies are SO adorable (especially when they talk), I do have a couple of negatives to note:    1) File size. This game is a whopping 47Mb, which isn't too bad, considering there are 4 worlds of levels and the graphics are pretty good. However, it's worth mentioning that this will take a while to download, like a good 5 minutes for standard connection speeds.    2) Transitions. While the graphics are of decent quality, some parts of the game are a bit laggy. This includes scrolling on the tutorial in the options menu, and moving from menu to menu. In addition, the music loop transition is a little choppy (as in there is a short but noticeable gap between the end and beginning of a track).    So, in short, here's my star tally for this game:    +4 stars for the game itself. It's a very simple game and incredibly cute, but it just doesn't have that 5 star quality for me.    -1 star for the two negatives (1/2 star per negative)    +1 star for great tutorial and lack of unnecessary permissions    Total: 4/5 stars    I would definitely recommend this game to any and all bunny lovers!    - Sam    Edit: It should also be noted that I'm playing this on a Kindle Fire HD 7\\".    - Sam    Edit: There is a small bug in this game that I've discovered. I don't know if it's just my copy or just for the Kindle Fire users, but for some reason, when I go back to the main menu and then try to reaccess the game by hitting the play button, an error pops up stating that it failed to check the license and that I need to enable a network connection and restart the app. After clicking okay, the app closes. I'm not going to dock any stars from my review, as it's a predictable and avoidable error, and simply restarting the app without enabling a network connection fixes the problem so I can still play.    It was pointed out to me in a comment that this might just be an error with the Amazon licensing and not the application itself, which is a little better than what I was originally thinking.    - Sam    Edit 08-01: The above bug appears to have been fixed in the most recent update. However, in the process it broke the game, as seen at the top.    - Sam    Edit 8/26/2014: Cleaned up a bit. Bug stuff from last year was irrelevant.
140006922X|5.0|The book does not grab you initially but it is a good read. It is possible the lives of that era are as described.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all Christians and Non-Christians.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|I thought it was too wordy in spots. It took too long to get to the point and left you hanging in the end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best for kindle fire it has great effects, has great pictures, and the game is great for all ages
B00005B36H|5.0|I am always looking or rather listening for new sounds and &#34;Tool&#34; has never disapointed me. As my budget expands so does my music files.

In joy this touching story that makes you cry but mostly laugh in August 's journey through 5th grade
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's super fun but there needs to be more adventures not just the same old same old. And the disguise s are to $$$$- have fun
B005LW5J9O|4.0|This book's pretext is a poem by the Roman Lucretius that challenged conventional Church thinking in the 15th century and thereafter. But it's hard to say it's \\"about\\" that poem. Basically it's a great romp through Roman times (when the poem was written) and (separately) the early 15th century when it was rediscovered.<br /><br />What \\"conversation\\" meant to Cicero. True lives of the popes. The real meaning of Thomas More's UTOPIA. What physically happened to a lot of Greek and Latin texts over the centuries. Why so many were lost, and how some survived. Etc Etc.<br /><br />The tale includes one of the funniest lines I've ever read: \\"Violators of the edict were threatened with eternal damnation and a fine of 10 ducats.\\"<br /><br />You kind of have to trust Greenblatt on his exegesis of the poem (which I calculate has about as many lines as my 263pp paperback, albeit at six beats per line--so I can see why it's not included), and also on the power it had over Isaac Newton and the rest of civilization thereafter. But this is offset by (for example) his tally of the numbers of chickens, carriages, and whores in town for a conference of three rival popes in the 15th century.<br /><br />The real hero of the story is the somewhat nerdy Poggio, seeking after the ancient Latin text even while serving as the Pope's secretary and right hand man.<br /><br />Some of the \\"pagan\\" (Latin) texts were admired for their language even as their content was deemed too dicey for mass consumption.<br /><br />I'm not sure Lucretius actually invented the atomistic worldview--that the world is just an assemblage of tiny eternal particles and nothing else--I thought that was a Greek guy, but Greenblatt makes a convincing case that he (plus Poggio of course) was the key one as far as using this idea to create a key \\"swerve\\" in the tide of history.<br /><br />There's an unintentional howler, too--when Greenblatt (in keeping with the trendline here) pooh poohs \\"creation ex nihilo.\\" Sure, this was a Church dogma countered by the eternal atoms, but it's also what modern cosmology says actually happened! The Big Bang, right? And quantum theory allows for creation out of nothing.<br /><br />Oh well, still a good book, particularly for all the background on the times.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Hours of fun great game can't stop playing....PvP fun lots of heroes to play with every week,plus you don't really have to spend real money to enjoy game. Recommend downloading for Kindle fire.
B005544TRQ|5.0|this is show is one of the best current shows. actually, all time....i love tv shows but this one has everything!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Everyone needs a book like this to read its very nice.<br />I think people over 12 would love this amazing book.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I just built a gaming computer, and thought I might as well buy the gaming mouse and keyboard to go with it. I didn't order it until after my computer was built, so I gamed with a normal mouse, and then this mouse and this mouse is so much better. I'm used to console, so my fingers weren't really used to reaching the SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT buttons. I love that they are also on the mouse. I like the fact that you can change the light color on the mouse, and I also think that it is cool that there are weights in the back to adjust the feel you like.<br /><br />Overall this mouse way exceeded what I was expecting out of it.<br /><br />EDIT- On the left clicker, there is a little dimple of the outer rubber coating sticking up. It feels like Mt. Everest is on my clicker. It's a small thing but it's kinda driving me crazy, and I don't want to pick at it to make it worse.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is awesome and the best New way for kids to have fun . Kids can enjoy it on kindle fire HD kindle free time
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I knew that Lana was good, but until I heard this entire CD, I failed to realize just HOW good she is!<br />In fact, I'm downgrading many of my other music titles and artists, given that Ms. Del Ray is so much more talented than I realized...<br /><br />Sometimes (ok, often) when I'm listening to this album, I feel as though I'm in heaven, listening to this unique & highly talented artist.  Her lyrics and voice (and voice control) are what real art is all about.<br />And I am trying to speak for so many other people, of all ages, who I believe will find this CD to be pure magic, honey-coated, superbly artistic magic...
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My 3 grandsons ordered it. They had a really fun time playing . I think others would enjoy it also.
B005PK57NU|4.0|I've followed this series on Amazon Prime videos and was so disappointed when season 4 was not available. I've  enjoyed the series.  The characters are real, intelligent and complicated by life's twists and turns.  It's easy to get hooked!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Friends have told me for years to watch Sherlock. Finally, through Amazon Prime, I did. It was fabulous. No wonder it's a hit. Acting, chatacterization, and scripting were all very good and production values are high.  If you haven't seen it yet, it's a must!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|McKenna displays an uncanny way of describing characters and settings for this story. You will laugh and you will feel sorrow but you will not regret you bought the book. I am looking forward to reading it a second time.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I got this from amazon.com before it was shown at my local cinema.  ideal for a 8 year old girl.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun! Some levels are easy but some are bit tricky. Good game for laying in bed. I wish you could use double tap to go back to main screen of the room bt other than that, I like it!
B00005JL2O|4.0|This movie takes one back to the 70s.  Quite enjoyable and with a good cast,to boot.  Good plays on words and good music.
0553386794|5.0|I already had this book, but it got water damaged so I had to repurchase it in order to complete my collection.  I love this book.  It is always unpredictable and you can't just expect that the good guy will win out in the end.  It really is a refreshing novel in that your favorite character is not necessarily your friends favorite character.  There is not one defined protagonist.  Every character is well developed and you get to see all sides of all main characters.
B002KKCVX2|4.0|replacement for five year old tevas.  the new ones are essentially the same but with a narrower, cheaper feeling strap
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show.  So suspenseful and love the story line.  Not a huge fan or horror or scary movies but love this show.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Great movie of this type. Watching movie versions of the comic book characters I grew up with is so nostalgic. This one was well made and the acting is top notch.
207030602X|5.0|I am American but a fluent French speaker.  I admit that i sometimes have a hard time reading and following dense French literature since my vocabulary isn't stellar.  I found this book, however, easy to follow, enjoyable to read, and a relatively quick read as well.  Content-wise the book is existential and like most of the novels in this genre not the most uplifting of stories. Still it is well written, engaging, and a classic piece of French literature that I would recommend to any francophones out there.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Simple read that gets you a great start to eating healthier and make good food choices. Repairing all the bad things we have done over time to hurt our body put in an easy to read and understand fashion.
B0010T75W6|5.0|Great movie.  Love the story, love the soundtrack.  Great ending, too.  A unique and edgy tale that addresses the universal truths of unrequited love.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I like it a lot, but I would never let my kids watch it ....<br />Funny story. Great actors.<br />Looking forward for the next season....
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|This writing has really nothing to offer if you are reall into Clancy and have already read his big titles. The biggest issue is that Clancy or whoever else took part in the creation clearly has no clue on modern technology beyond the level of a fifth grader. and in such a case tools you accept  only in fairly tales have to be utilized for the story to not fall apart. miracles and deus ex machina are not fitting in a spy novel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this virtual game, I wish I had a real horse lol<br />It's also great for little kids
B004RE2J7W|5.0|i seen this film at a drive in with my mom as a teenager.love the film,just can't understand why my mom seen it.could have seen it at a theater.now i have all the films they made
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Fantastic story line. There are times that the plot was slow but was steadfast and couldn't put the book down. Agree with the mentions of life philosophies.<br />Recommend the series to everyone.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really kept my attention. Well written. Would be a great book to discuss with a book group. The premise is both interesting and feels new
B008MM9630|5.0|I love the game it's one of those games you always play. I just with the energy refilled faster or you'd have more energy to use, it would be awesome if they'd give unlimited energy.
0061730327|2.0|I've looked at a library copy of the book I sent for for my stepdaughter and it looks like I very good book.  However, the copy I ordered from the seller still has not arrived and they assure me there is nothing they can do about it, without a tracking number.  It is out of their hands, after having shipped it on July 9th.  It is infuriating to be at the effect of the postal service to get a book I ordered in a timely manner.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Good movie but slow at times for me. This is one of those movies that you really need to watch in the theater. I have read the book and this is one of the first movies I have seen that does justice to the book it was adapted from.
1446303314|5.0|This book have the most beautiful projects ever! I love every single one! They are all cute. The doll are beautiful!
B006S01GH2|5.0|This was so interesting.  Amelie was a lovely character.  Nice to see something a little different, interesting.  I would recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|super fun and addictive!  Starts off easy and goes to very hard.  Some seem impossible to complete but are indeed doable.  Bought it for the wife and now I'm hooked.  Highly recommended.

B009POHHR6|5.0|Absolutely amazing take on the ultimate \\"what if\\" scenario! I just wish I'd discovered it sooner... There isn't a person in the world that I won't recommend this to!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Look up the Minimum System Requirements before you buy, you need a 2nd gen i5 or greater processor. Which means in apple world that's a macbook from this year or last year. Windows world its a $1000 & up machine. Im kinda unhappy that the streaming quality of the chrome tab is really bad. Laggy stuttering ect... I wish amazon would show this on the product page b/c i would have never bought if i realized i couldn't use the dang thing.<br />YouTube app & Netflix app on an iPhone works perfect though, but my apple TV already does that too. I was looking for this as a way to play videos from a web browser like its advertised
B002ZG976U|5.0|Christina Aguilar is awesome as so is Cher love her movie is excellent Will watch it over and over I recommend it highly will keep you entertained the whole time you are watching it
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This is not Waiting for Godot, do not expect is to be anything other than what it is.  Old School entertainment, action, and some laughs for good measure.  The chemistry between the lead actors is wonderful considering that each has been a top box office draw during their long careers.  The action is well choreographed, Jason Statham is great.  i did miss Jet Li whose role is small and Mickey Rorke who is absent even more.  I look forward to the Expendables 3 and enjoying the present two movies.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I purchased this for a little guy's birthday, he says it was his favorite gift. Wish now that i had watched it first. LOL
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game but... I was forced to un-install the game because I pressed a wrong button and I lost some Gru-Points and I cant get them back so some advise for Gameloft, add one ive those : Are You Sure You Want To Skip This Mission&hellip;or&hellip; Are You Sure You Want To Buy This Costume... so just be careful about that
B00004WEJZ|5.0|This is a remake of Thunderball, but I still like it since it's a James Bond movie. Would highly recommend to anyone who has a love for James Bond movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thought this show was very well done. Downton provides a look into a different world and a different era. I can hardly wait for the next season of Downton Abby.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|this device is a POS.  would not recommend.  it's just a stripped down google tv, which sucked already..  zero stars.
B00BESCJII|5.0|Such a sweet compelling movie, loved watching it. I don't normally cry, but this movie did work on my emotional side. All so American. Perfect for both high schoolers and adults.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I love fun shows and have always rooted for the underdog.  Pair this with song and dance and you have pure magic!  I am up to date with all seasons, but wanted to see Finn Hudson from the beginning.  He was always my favorite and I had a huge crush on him.  May he RIP:o(  Glee will never be the same without him and I am curious to see how they write him off the show come fall.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is very entertaining, I played all the levels. I am waiting for part 2 since I had finished it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show!  Could not stop watching the season. I am now hooked. I have watched through season 2 and now I have to wait for the new episode each week on USA network for season 3. I can't believe I just found this show. .
B001NLKT60|4.0|This 2nd book in the series starts to put all the pieces together in Lisbeth Sander's life. The plot twists build to a dramatic and &#34;wanting more&#34; ending. On to the final book in the series!
B004LROMQG|5.0|I am truely a Merin fan. I was lucky enough to meet Colin Morgan at SDCC 2012 one on one. A terrfic person and brilliant actor. He won the NTA in London last January, 2013 for being the best dramatic actor. The Third season it great and the fourth and fifth are just as good. I recommend it to all Merlin fans. You won't be disappointed.
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|I believe Khaled Hosseini is an amazing storyteller and I look forward to what comes next. Kite Runner, Splendid Suns, Mountains...what's next?
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I bought it for my niece and she just loves it. She watches it over and over again as all kids do. I would recommend it to friends.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Fans of Mahjong will like this product. Very attractive layouts and tiles. Only drawback is that sometimes it's hard to pick a tile by touch due to its small size on the screen.
1455523003|5.0|A Excellent eye opener on the real motives and action of a so called &#34;saint&#34;. An incisive and short book !
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|It's yet another spin off of farm town, and the dozens of other games like it. You get a limited number decorations, then you have to buy more. I uninstalled it immediately.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love to play this game. So much that I have it on my boyfriends iphone too. The only issue I have is that his phone has more updates then my kindle. If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars.
B00821OX98|5.0|I love Sci-Fi and adventure.  Falling Skies has both elements and it is well done.  I love watching it and can't wait for more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great problem solving fun for the family.  We have ages from 7 to 41 playing. All of us enjoy the game. More levels please
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Very good series, slow at times but overall very good. Not &#34;24&#34; but resonable substitute for those of us who love that type of series.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love playing this game.  It it fast and challenging.  Helps you keep track and try to beat your best scores - and those of your friends.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|really nice book it was very informative and worth my time. I kinda sped through the whole book but i liked it.
B0098460O4|5.0|Another BGT success story - excellent performance, nice combination of voices, amazing talent.  I thoroughly enjoy the selection of songs.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I am commenting on the packaging, since I haven't watched them yet.  I picked this set up after having it on my wish list since before last Christmas.  I happened to catch it on a day when the price was the lowest I had seen it so far.  Maybe they are going to change up the packaging or something, but I jumped on the price!  It's usually around fifty bucks but I got it for about 25% less.<br /><br />It has probably been noted, but the Blu-ray discs are each in a cardboard sleeve of a book-like insert.  It's cute and compact, but in order to get the disc out you have to grab it and pull.  There is no way to keep from getting fingerprints on it!  Unless you wear gloves.<br /><br />These are all time favorite movies with Harrison Ford!!  How can you go wrong?  I had the set in VHS, but figured it was time to upgrade.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|It's always lovely listening to Susan Boyle.  Her voice is amazing, the variety of songs is delightful.  This cd is wonderful.
B007WDPPK8|5.0|I have not had a chance to actually use the book yet. Quick overview indicates it will be easy to use. The directions are understandable.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|I grew up on Lemmings, and I enjoyed playing all the Dibbles games. So, yeah, maybe this review is skewed because I love this genre. Good graphics, puzzles have been super easy so far (up to level 10). That will be my only complaint if the levels don't get harder, but still a very enjoyable game.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My grandson is going to show me how to play this game, he loves to play this game.  I hope it is soon.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie was really good and touched on a lot of thing that we don't really like to look at, such as mental health, but that need to be discussed. Beautifully written and acted.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is another game that keeps my mind shape and keeps my eye moving.  I love playing it and keeping my mind busy.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book had me from page one. I can\\"t believe a girl wrote it because the story is being shown thru a guy\\"s eyes. This book will have you LOL and then go WOW! I think guys even need to read this. I know I showed my husband parts. I can\\"t wait for the next book(no cliffhanger). For now you should go on Emma\\"s website and read some more hilarious things between Drew and Kate to hold you over or else say hurry up and get that second book done. Can\\"t wait.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The book was amazing as always! I loved every minute of it! I can't wait to read the next book!
B00005QB42|5.0|This one as well as the other cd's is pure soul music I can't stop listening I love all Deva & Miten's music it is heavenly. This is my most favourite so far.
B004KPLVYU|3.0|But can't get past the &#34;meh&#34; feeling. I have a deep love of Tim Burton and of course Johnny Deep but this one always felt so rushed. There's never any down time for any of the characters so it constantly feels rushed. That's probably not a problem for most people but I found myself not caring about Alice (or any of the characters in fact) because there was never enough time for suspense to build or a threat to be established. It was just &#34;this is bad, oh no, now this is bad, eek, this is bad too!&#34;. The gravity of the situations never really sunk in, so it never felt engaging, just eye candy. That and I've seen better acting from rocks than Alice, but again that's just me.<br /><br />Visually it was a great movie and it definitely has Burton's spin to it. It does look great in Blu Ray as well so if you want something that looks pretty, pick this up.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I saw a suggestion to read the book online and decided to go with it. Old Man's War was a great read and was even a bit thought-provoking. I would definitely recommend!
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of my biggest regrets is that I found Firefly years after the show was canceled. TV Sci-Fi was always a touchy subject to me because most shows are just plain cheesy. However I always heard people talking about how great this show was. After a brief unemployment stint I got a chance to watch it and fell in love.<br /><br />The series is great and even though it was short it had great potential. The marrying of sci-fi and cowboys probably threw most of the general public for a loop but I thought it worked well. Think of it as Han Solo's younger life. The universe itself was interesting and while some things have popped up before the mash up worked well.<br /><br />Having this on Blu Ray is a treat in itself as I can't go back to watching regular DVD. If you love sci-fi, definitely pick this up.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This new version is very hard to read Temp blends in with background.My grandsons are color blind and have problems sometimes simple is better thank you.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am not quite finished with this, but find the way the characters weave in and out of the story fascinating.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I think this devices has so much potential, once more apps get on board. I'm hoping this can eventually replace my Roku but this cant happen unless the chromecast gets a user interface and a physical remote control. Using smart phones are really great but often I just want to use one hand to control the tv and not have to look at a smart phone to do so. The chromecast has bluetooth support so there is certainly potential for this...time will tell.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Number of explosions: 0<br />Sex Scenes: 0<br />Product Placement: 0<br />Crude Humor: 0<br />Seizure inducing Action scenes: -10<br /><br />This is one of those movies that doesn't need the teenage fan crowd to succeed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really liked the app easy to download. horse is cool even does flying lead changes! contests are easy and fun to compete in too
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Being able to switch the blocks of the world keeps it interesting. Quote from 10 year old grandson.<br /><br />We paid $49.95, which is high but I see now that it's only $34.95 Still overpriced for what you get but unique for a kid who loves MineCraft and legos.
1608871517|5.0|This book show us a not so explored side of King of Pop, but so amazing like his music! Beautiful photos.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting perspective as the story is told - from each of the main characters' point of view as the events unfold. Just when one chapter was beginning to feel a bit tedious, the author switches. I started out liking the female character and feeling distain for her husband until the true characters unfolded in the story. Then, I .....  Well, not to give it away. You read it and decide for yourself. Who deserved what and why? It's an entertaining summer read or one by the fire in the winter.
B005K17RU0|5.0|So much better than Weather Channel app.<br /> It has all the features I want and it is easy to use.<br />I highly recommend it.
B0081336FO|5.0|Do I love this series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There is nothing else like it.<br />I see a little Monk in it, when John Watson tries to guide Sherlock.<br />This is the best series on television since Dexter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan, I do hope you appreciate this<br />new modern take on it.  I know you true Holmes Society of<br />England fans when it comes to your precious Sherlock.  You<br />take this very very seriously.  Loosen up a little.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game and I also loved the movie and I say its a great match, almost  everything in the movie is on the game...picture wise. so everyone go bananas and get this game!!!!! :D
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Awesome movie. A real cliffhanger! Look for Ted Knight from the Mary Tyler Moore show at the very end of it
140006922X|3.0|Asain does much to lay the groundwork for the political time surrounding Jesus of Nazareth.  What he doesn't answer is this:  Why is this political zealot and would be messiah's name remembered and worshipped when all the  other messiahs of his time never made it to the history books.  How is it that his fearful, rag-tag followers risked and gave their very lives in following him AFTER his death.  Could it be that the resurrection was the game changer?  Asian does not address these questions.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|People have told me I'd love Bukowski and they were right.  This was the first time I've read a whole Bukowski novel and I plan to read more.  I laughed, got angy and was sickened but really rooted for the loser at the heart of this story.  Bukowski is straightforward and hard hitting yet poetic in his simplicity and raw word power.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I loved Rio. I ordered for grandchildren and I enjoyed movie just as much as they did. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has not watched this movie.
0375826742|5.0|I'll have to take my 13 year old's word for it - he loves it!  If your child is a reader, I highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Really hated the way the book ended. However, up to that point it did have some interesting twists and turns which kept me reading. The two main characters turn out to be a pair of disturbed and disturbing people. The only thing to say is thank goodness they found each other and did not subject anyone else to being married to either of them.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|My 24 year old daughter just finished performing as Amy in a community theater production of the musical Little Women and my younger brother played the part of the Professor.  That is what prompted me to read the book.  That, and the fact that I have 4 daughters of my own.  There should be a &#34;number of tissues needed&#34;  rating along with the star rating on Amazon.  The story simply hit home for me:)  Enjoy!
B00DP3IESY|3.0|Movie maintained my attention, Love story weak, tentative subplot. Effects convincing but we have seen the ruined planet many times.  Three stars.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|This product was in the condition that it stated.  And at such a great price for new.  It is a very funny, but sound moral film for all ages.
B0042ESTQW|4.0|Doesn't fit as tight as I thought it would since it's an OEM product, but acceptable. Covers the very nice etched &#34;garmin&#34; brand so for the vain ones among us, you may not want this. But I say safety first, especially when mountain biking.
0071390111|4.0|After its release was pushed back many times, the 5th edition finally came out within the past year, and I have been reading it on my laptop's Kindle app throughout my first year of core PhD courses and in preparing for my qualifying exam. I had read some of the 4th edition during undergrad, as well.<br /><br />In general my feelings towards the book are warm, and I do expect that if you read the textbook, dear reader of this review, you will learn a lot from it.<br /><br />Positives<br /><br />1) Does a good job of not trying to be Alberts' *Molecular Biology of the Cell*. The sections on cell biology, the central dogma, and non-neuroscience-related signaling pathways are refreshingly bare-boned. Seek resources elsewhere if you want to go ham on transcription, translation, and the MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK cascade.<br /><br />2) Perception, sensation, and movement were not the reasons that I first became interested in neuroscience, and, generalizing from my one example as is de rigueur in book reviews, I think that is true of most students. And while this might be just Stockholm syndrome, I'm actually quite happy that there is so much detail and care put into these sections which make up around 1/3rd of the text. These fields are way more tractable to study than the sexy emotion, learning, and personal identity, yet the most of the principles that have been discovered there are likely to generalize.<br /><br />As an example of this, consider the work of Charles Sherrington, who among other accomplishments won the 1932 Nobel for explaining spinal reflexes as a balance of excitation and inhibition. And now that we have some fancy techniques like conditional genetic KOs and optogenetics, we know that a variety of other phenomena, from critical periods to anxiety, are also regulated via a very similar balance of excitation and inhibition.<br /><br />3) Most chapters do an excellent job of motivating their material. For example, they emphasize themes from the history of how people have thought about the brain, e.g. James and Freud. There are also a few references to art and literature, such as Gabriel Garcia-Marquez, that are really money.<br /><br />4) Most fundamentally, this is the eminent textbook on how your mind works and how you are able to understand the words that you are currently reading. And there are some chapters, especially the last three (65 - 67), that really delve into this. What's there not to love?<br /><br />Negatives<br /><br />1) In general neuroscience tries very hard to distinguish itself from psychology and this makes good sense in terms of specialization. But the field is still operating in the wake of Karl Lashley, a famous experimentalist who in the 1930s concluded that brain regions had \\"equipotentiality\\" for learning mazes not because his lesions were flawed but because his tasks were not specific enough. Designing behavioral tasks is not trivial. Yet, you will not read much about the principles behind how to do so, and nothing about the matching law or Rescorla-Wagner. (My bias: I did some research in learning and behavior in undergrad.)<br /><br />2) For one of our classes we read an older (3rd edition) version of Chapter 13 on Neurotransmitters. There were way more equations explaining different models of neurotransmitter vesicle release patterns, e.g. explaining the use of the Poisson distribution as an approximation for the binomial. It doesn't make sense that the text has become less quantitative at the same time that math has become easier to use to explain phenomena, as a result of advances in systems biology and just programming generally.<br /><br />3) Why does searching for \\"optogenetics\\" yield me zero results?<br /><br />4) I prefer my pedagogical material to be structured in the format of *example 1*, *example 2*, (*optional example 3*), and *inducted principle*. The examples only matter insofar as they motivate the principles. Kandel's textbook strays slightly too far from this, I think. In particular, the text tends to enshrine the examples, such CREB, CamKII, PKA, and the ilk, as worthy of our worship in and of themselves. This sets the trend for how neuroscience courses should be taught and for that reason it is a bit troubling.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This has an amazing selection of noises ranging from countrty night toils sounds to vacuum cleaner noises. in adddition to this you can layer multiple sounds for a tailor made white noise experience.
B0086213XW|1.0|Stupid movie without any story<br />I don't even wast my time writing anything about this movie, I am surprised that Seth Rogen accepted the role. It's a real abomination.<br />Wasted my time watching it.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Good color, sound, and history. The planes were real sounding, looked good, directions were a little off. Had to tilt the screen.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I recently finished reading Choose Yourself! and thought it was not only worth the read, but worth pulling together a quick write-up on the book itself.<br /><br />I learned about the book through Altucher's blog, which I subscribed to about two months ago. Before you read the book, I recommend you take some time to check out a few of his posts since the writing style is very similar and could make or break it for you.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, with a title like &#34;Choose Yourself!&#34;, the book is semi-motivational in nature. And, personally, I'm a sucker for the motivational/self-help/business genre, but unfortunately many of the books turn out to be pretentious and phony. I appreciate when the author shows humility and isn't afraid to go into detail about their mistakes. In the book Altucher writes, &#34;I don't give any advice on things I don't know about firsthand&#34; and that makes the lessons and advice all the more powerful. After all, it's arguably more important to learn from others mistakes than it is to learn from their success.<br /><br />I recommend reading Choose Yourself! - it's a great book to read and consider how you operate personally and professionally.
