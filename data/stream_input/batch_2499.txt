B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like this game so far and the graphics are not bad either. you should definitely give it a try.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I wish Buble included more standards on the CD.<br />Too many original, unknown songs<br />My least favorite of all his CD's
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this all the time.  It is perfect for writing short notes to myself to remind me of things and to make to do lists.
B0091REZMW|5.0|If you do not watch out this game will help you pass a lot of time. Even my son loves to play.
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|Since I live in New Orleans, I feel that the writers did an excellent job of portraying all parts of this wonderful city. What a delight for kids of all ages. Great music and dancing. Highly recommend.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I really love 'Castle'. The scripts are well written with twists and turns. The characters are well cast. These actors work well together, play off each other. There is charisma and depth. I started with Season One and am moving right on through enjoying every episode.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|There are no directions and I have tried to make it work using different approaches and nothing workis.  Any suggestions?

B009R659L8|3.0|It was disappointed as it was clear what was going to happen by chapter three<br />I usually love her books.
B006WZIETG|4.0|not as good as the original but a very fun movie still. not a classic x-mas film but gets the job done.<br />looks and sounds great on blu-ray.
B0091JQH76|5.0|Hats off to EMI for making this set available and a no-brainer for any lover of Poulenc's music or anyone else for that matter. The performances are all superb and as another reviewer noted many of them are reference recordings, but for my money the real treasure in this set is the complete melodies, featuring not only some of the last century's leading vocalists and accompanists but several cameo appearances by Poulenc himself. Stellar performances of fantastic music.
B0014QABX0|5.0|awesome if you are a fan of the black keys and it's produced by danger mouse. you almost have to get all the cd's from them because they rock.
B005C8ENI0|3.0|Decent movie, weak ending. But not a bad choice. Easy ploy to follow and basically an average flick. It's free on prime.
B00AEBB8XS|3.0|wow it looks great and sounds really good but the dir cut is a little different and was just kinda weird. but the blu-ray is cool with some extras.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|so addicting because it keeps you engaged constantly and overall very fun. also the ability to upgrade your vehicles is another awesome aspect of this game
B009VSW15Y|3.0|not too bad but i didn't buy the kindle for the camera. it takes not too great photos. but i don't use it a lot.
B007QJ8VBI|5.0|Funny and a great plot!  Something for an afternoon movie on a rainy day with you and your older daughter.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|fun.fun.fun you can get so hooked so quick on it. makes me want to see the movie again and again.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is working great!  Thanks for<br />responding so quickly.  I would recommend the Kindle to anyone that loves to read...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game for a recent kindle owner. I had to take a break from angry birds and this game hit the spot.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|**To any of you prudes that can't open your mind for adventure, I'm betting your sex life sucks big time! The books gave so much insight to the working of minds, and if you can't or are unwilling to see it- you are only lying to yourself! Wake up people, life is out there, and our experiences in life mold us to the people we are! Don't hate the book, just because you are afraid to face your own demons!<br />The whole trilogy was incredible- It was a great finish of the series, and it revealed great clarity of how our early years of life contribute to the people we become as adults!. I really had lots of fun reading the books, and the conversations between the 2 main characters was as humorous as the first 2 books!
B0044WSF5M|5.0|This was an awesome flick but the Internet connection was not good and the movie would stop on and off several times during the show and I had to resume the movie many times!<br />I am not sure if I would rent another movie from this site ever again... I may just subscribe to netflex in the future... But again the movie was very good...
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Especially enjoyed how the English justice and politcal operate. A great continuation of the Clifton Chronicles and the ending makes it obvious there is more in the series
B00AFZ86BA|5.0|All the greatest albums that you ever wanted in one small package.  You couldn't ask for a better price either.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesome I play it all the time I cant wait for update never seen herobrine so don't worry about him
B00B4VXQC8|3.0|I thought that is was average at best.  I'm still old school and miss the songs of the past like Run Away and You Give Love A Bad Name.  You won't get that here!
B007X70NVO|5.0|One of the best documentaries out there, regardless of whether you ride or not. The passion for the sport is evident in all the people in the film but also in the people who made the movie.
B002WTOXUK|4.0|Great movie! I'm a big sci-fi buff, so this was right in my wheel house. Very entertaining and lively. From start to finish, I was really in to the movie.  Very good acting with a solid plot.  Well done.
0812550706|5.0|In a world where the human population has reached an all time high and families are restricted to the number of children they may have to control the population, there isn't much room left for a growing population. The need to find another planet capable of supporting life increases as the days go by. Ender's Game takes place in the future when man has technology advanced enough to travel to and colonize different worlds. But we're not the only intelligent life with the technology necessary to do this. We call them Buggers.<br />  We've had two encounters with them previously. The first was just a chance encounter. The second invasion was a mission of colonization, we were greatly outnumbered but managed to barely claim victory thanks to a genius commander by the name of Mazer Rackham. After the second encounter all the countries of Earth put off all fighting among themselves and prioritized working together to defeat the Buggers.<br />  But the Buggers are difficult for many of us to understand. In warfare they react so quickly and they are attack patterns seem so random that it is very difficult for us to predict what they are going to do. Earth decides we need a different kind of commander if we wish to defeat the Buggers once and for all. Someone much younger who they can train from an early age. A battle school is established where young prospects are sent to be bred as leaders of the next war. They are taught history on previous wars and they simulate combat in a controlled environment called the battle room. One young boy sticks out from the rest. His name is Ender Wiggins.<br />  Throughout the story Ender is tested in far to many ways to count. From how he interacts with his new peers in battle school to how he performs in the battle room. Everything Ender Wiggins does is designed to push him to the edge as the leaders of the school hope he is the one they have been searching for to lead an army to war against the Buggers. If he is not, there may not be time to find the one who is.<br />  Ender's Game is an excellent sci-fi book filled with many twists that will keep you on your toes. Never expect to know what is going to happen. Ender's Game is a well written novel that appeals to many readers with its original plot, variety of characters and very intense moments that make you relate to and care for Ender Wiggins.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Could not wait til Season Five came out.  Filled with great actors, great dialogues, surprises and most of all, Merlin!!!!!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is a great blend of match three and RPG. It's really tough to put down once you start. The mini goals also give you more things to strive for while you are playing. This is definitely one of the better match three games available for tablet and mobile.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Haven't enjoyed a series out of England this much in a long time.  A different twist on an old tale with great acting, surprises and the best is the actor portraying Merlin.  The last episode is sad, clever and wanting for more!
B000W7JWUA|2.0|This game is very fun. I highly recommend it to all my friends, and most of them own this game. Build quality is great, the pieces are sturdy and simple. However, the unit I received was missing a few wooden road pieces. This is the first time I've ever bought a brand-new game and it arrive sealed, with missing pieces. We have made adjustments so that gameplay remains fair. Don't let my poor review change your mind, this is a great game to have. I don't feel I can award five stars for poor quality control.

0743244249|5.0|\\"When he woke up, he didn't know what he wanted.  Then he knew.  He wanted to get a haircut.\\"<br /><br />How perfect a setup is that?  I mean, it sounds so vague and almost meaningless and yet it brilliantly captures the whole vivid meaning behind Don DeLillo's tightly focused novel, `Cosmopolis'.  In taking a singular act, and act of seemingly no consequence and adding layer after layer of depth and consequence, DeLillo has sculpted for the reader a look at human society deeply rooted in self-centered apathy.<br /><br />And death, a human society deeply rooted in death.<br /><br />Don DeLillo is an author I've wanted, for years, to get into.  I've read wonderful things about his novels, but their girth always feels so daunting.  `Underworld' in particular, which has garnered the bulk of his praise, looks so hard to get through.  After reading `Cosmopolis' (one of his shorter, more concise novels), I feel as though I can break into his weightier material.  While his tone is certainly distanced, almost cold, he has a way with words that completely draw me in.  This took me two days to read, two sittings.  Now I completely understand those who say this takes longer to stomach in full, because the bleak outlining of every word can be almost overwhelming, but I found the brutal honesty so enriching, so compelling.<br /><br />It also didn't hurt that I had previously seen the film adaptation, and so as I read DeLillo's words I was transported to a visual state where these words and actions had a more impactful meaning.<br /><br />The prose simply follows a young billionaire as he ventures out in his limousine to get a haircut.  The President is in town, the roads are blocked severely by security, and his trip to the barber is an all-day event filled with routine doctor visits, speculation with employees, meaningful talks, rendezvous with lovers, meals with his wife and gunfire, mostly contained in the vicinity of his limousine.  Eric's apathetic approach to his life, his responsibilities and those who run in his circle is apparent from the outset, but as death looms in the air (in many shapes, sizes and shades) his outlook on life and reflection on his own viewpoint is brought into a more luminous light.  By the time the story concludes, we see a true arc in this man and are given a chance for self-reflection.<br /><br />As some have noted, there is an honesty to the proceedings that outshine the story's obvious outlandishness.  The whole prose is larger than life so-to-speak, and yet it is grounded in something earnest and true.  I absolutely loved this, and reading the rich dialog and reflective conversation only helped me appreciate the film all the more.  They are perfect companion pieces that I highly recommend!responsibilities and those who run in his circle is apparent from the outset, but as death looms in the air (in many shapes, sizes and shades) his outlook on life and reflection on his own viewpoint is brought into a more luminous light.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Hi my name is Leah and I'm a pin-aholic!!<br /><br />I love it. It's fantastic. There's always something new, you learn so many cool tricks DIYs. Idk what more to say other than its incredible :). You should definitely try it. It works great on the kindle fire hd.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was introduced to this game and I absolutely love playing this fun game. I wake up in the morning to play from my kindle out of all the games I have downloaded this is one of my favorites.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|If all that you want to do is just read a book on your Android device then Kindle works fine for that but that mode alone is so sixteenth century.  On the other hand, if you want to have a good text to speech option for reading newer books when an Audible.com version is not available then the Kindle app is useless.  Likewise if you want to copy some text for a literature review then Kindle is also a poor option.  I personally try to avoid Kindle versions of books.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I always like the sarcastic John Corey and his outlook on life; however, this book was not as good as some of the others.  A lot of the time spent in Yemen dragged while characters were added and developed.  The villain, though despicable, did not reach the level of cunning as the Lion.  The ending left me disappointed and wanting more, but I guess that was the author's intention.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Over 40? Married? Have kids? Have a sense of humor? All of the above? This movie has some great and funny moments. Very enjoyable.
B00171EO0I|5.0|Breathtaking story, though horrifically sad, and uplifting all at the same time... Great soundtrack and terrific acting.  A+ chick flick!
B000B5OD4I|1.0|I bought this hoping it would be a solid, low-maintenance replacement for various cheap-o Csio's I've had over the years.  It was not.<br /><br />1) This thing is heavy... pathologically so.  Unless you have the wrists of a lineman, it will weigh on you and annoy you.<br />2) After five years, it stopped.  the local watch shop charged me almost the cost of the watch to resurrect it.  I might have shopped around, but still, five years?  The afore-mentioned Casio lasted longer than that on its first battery!<br />3) I'm not convinced it's working now that I have it back!<br /><br />I'll likely eBay it, or check if there is a &#34;lifetime&#34; warranty.
0439023491|5.0|Loved it. After reading the first book I wanted the second and third book. I ordered both and am very happy.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I can't believe another movie was made by changing the entire dynamic of the original story. how can u keep fans when u delete characters and change the ones u do keep into something they are not. i suffered through 2 hrs of this crap. i liked the actors and its not there fault the director writer destroyed this story.
B007TKT2SK|3.0|it is ok for what it is a fraction calculator.  as  combination or stand alone calculator it fails.<br />  th you
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games<br /><br />I enjoy wasting time using this program. I would recommend to friends and family members. suduko is the best game ever
0385349947|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was well written, to the point, had clear and reliable facts, and was short enough to keep the reader's attention. It is something both men and women should read.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|While I'll admit, *if* you turn your brain off, Darkness is a fun, brainless, action flick.  That isn't what Star Trek aspires to be though.  From start to finish, it's one unbelievable event after another, from turning the Enterprise into a submarine (no spoiler since they gave that away in the trailers) to a deus ex machina resurrection you know is coming, and exactly how, from second you see the character going into peril.  There are a couple of minor surprises, and the acting and special effects are top notch, but the plot details are ridiculous.  Fun action yes (as long as you don't think about what's happening), but science fiction it's not.  They could do, and have done, far better.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is amazing! I played for about an hour for three days before I beat it. This is one of the most creative apps I've seen. It's not just the same old match 3 or ho game, u really have to use your brain. Very fun &amp; challenging.  Graphics are great also. On the last screen it promises more &quot;rooms&quot; coming up &amp; also that this is the devs first game &amp; I just wanna say bravo, fireproof games! 2 thumbs up from me!! Get us new rooms as soon as possible please!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is very fun. I love that u can interact with the horse. I have this game on all my mobile devices.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|1 didnt care for this app it was stupid and did nothing  it was a stupid and very dumb app
B000002J2D|3.0|In the same time as this was released Steve Hackett put out an album called[[ASIN:B000F7M89O Please Don't Touch (inkl. 3 Bonus Tracks)]]  Chester Thomson plays on it and has all the missing solos that were always on a Genesis album. Please Don't Touch was a rejected Genesis song off the Wind and Wuthering album that Steve Hackett wrote but Phil Collins couldn't get into. Peter Gabriel had the 1978 [[ASIN:B0043XUZLE Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch (Remastered)]]  and Anthony Phillips had [[ASIN:B008HHJFPE Wise After the Event]] I would recomend getting all three albums and making a post Genesis mix
B008XOXGL0|5.0|I bought Night Visions after hearing them on the radio. I splurged and bought the vinyl copy. It arrived in a nice package and the album itself has great artwork, and simple design. I put it on my turntable and was blown away by the bass and sheer awesomeness of the music. I love this album.
B000002ADT|5.0|Every track is so amazing!! Miles really makes you remember all the important things in life and why they are so special.
B004V8W54Q|4.0|I am glad that this is the original theatrical release and not the version with the altered ending done for television. It would be nice if there were some extras on here- it's basically just the movie- but then &#34;just the movie&#34; is quite extraordinary.
B0011Z50VM|5.0|I bought this mainly for the live tracks. Aaron Lewis has one of my favorite voices in rock, and I am always thrilled to hear him sing live. On this disc are several Staind songs as well as some covers. Great variety and great value.
014103579X|4.0|As a non-artist, this book was just, well, over my head. I enjoyed perusing it and loved learning some of the concepts, and perhaps as my artistic talent buds it will become more valuable.
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|Corey Taylor is my favorite voice in rock music, and I'm a fan of both Slipknot and Stone Sour. Taylor is one of those artists who sounds even better live than recorded, a pretty big feat these days. I saw Stone Sour at the beginning of the House of Gold & Bones Part 1 tour and anxiously awaited the release of the Part 2 album.<br /><br />A few thoughts...<br /><br />First of all, I actually don't like extended screaming/bellowing in music. I know, this is Corey f'ing Taylor we're talking about here. You don't need to remind me of that. Normally I just avoid songs that irritate me. That said, I adore Red City--right up until the moment Corey starts bellowing. That kills my enjoyment of the song and I have to move on to the next track. Corey has such a genuinely talented singing voice, I don't understand why the bellowing is necessary.<br /><br />I was a little torn about The House of Gold and Bones. It's very reminiscent of Gone Sovereign & Absolute Zero (from HoGAB p1) and at times the melody made me lose track of which song I was listening to. Once I got past that and became more familiar with the song, I love it. It really sums up these two albums.<br /><br />The album overall takes a bit of a mournful tone. There are a couple songs that sound downright morose. In a way, I feel like this album is lacking some of the energy of previous Stone Sour albums--there are several upbeat songs, to be sure, but the mournful tone found throughout the album brings it down a notch. It doesn't bother me as much as it did on first listen, though.<br /><br />I am really impressed with the way the songs flow into one another. This level of continuity is a rare treat, and it's one of my favorite things about this album. Another favorite is the melodies--they are flowing, evocative, and really well written. I love the piano presence in the music.<br /><br />Overall, the album has a couple low points for me, but it's a definite win in my book.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This program is super useful and makes calculating fractions easy. Yes, I can do it all on paper and even in my head, but it does make it quicker to check the kids homework... plus, I am neck deep in numbers all day and frankly the last thing I want to do is expend brain power on fractions. =)<br />I HIGHLY recommend this software!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|touching movie that truly makes you feel for zach and his life that is not what he was expecting.  after meeting the man of his dreams, he gets a new life and begins to live!!  wonderful story!
B008F1NICI|5.0|If \\"Someone Here... \\" is Pineapple Thief's \\"Dark Side\\", then this is their \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" There will be many disputes as to which album is superior. Here we see Mr Soord adding choir and symphony orchestra to his songs, to great effect, without overwhelming the intimate nature of the songs. (You can watch some of the recordings on YouTube, and see Bruce's appreciation of what the classical musicians add to his music.) I love the slurred violins, which recall the backing to \\"I am the Walrus\\" and other classic Beatles recordings. The obligatory long finale (\\"Reaching Out\\") is suitably wonderful, and a fine contender for fan favourite. I wish I was in the UK this summer to see this band. They are the best thing I have heard since discovering Sufjan Stevens in the mid - eleventies. Make sure you get the double CD, as the acoustic versions are just as good as the electric ones, and there's a fab version of \\"I will Light Up Your Eyes\\" on it.
1451627289|5.0|a story as only the master storyteller can bring to life on paper!!  nothing can compare to stephen king at his best!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|The game is definitely fun and addicting. It has a total of 50 levels and once complete you can choose to go back and replay any of the 50. My only complaint is the challenge of the day is very difficult and almost requires you to spend money to upgrade. I was able to complete it only once using the girl, who in my opinion is the strongest character in the game. i never purchased the magic user so i can not speak for her. Overall, I did enjoy this game.
B00C061I3K|4.0|It's an interesting album...smooth and enjoyable quality music. was doubtful about the album before i bought it, but after listening to it a few more time its a real cool cd
1936608898|5.0|I followed the plan to the letter. Today is the day \\"after\\" I completed the 30 day period and I stayed on the plan today because I just feel so good. It make a remarkable difference in my energy, mood, and reduction in swelling. Remarkable. The old \\"me\\" feels like a distant slug of a memory compared to this \\"new\\" me. After day 5 my cravings were significantly reduced and it made the rest of the time on the plan much easier. Only after sticking with it for the whole 30 and not cheating at all can you know the effects sugar and grains had on your body functions. Get it, read it cover to cover, and do it wholeheartedly for the whole30.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Kept my interest throughout! Very heart felt! Especially loved all the quotes before each chapter, I would recommend this book as a good read for anyone!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am an avid reader and had gotten to the point that everything in my library was read at least once. Not typically my genre but my boyfriend recommended this to me and OH MY GOODNESS was I ever hooked. I completely ignored my boyfriend, didn't do laundry, even forgot to eat lunch because I was so hooked. Loved loved loved this book.
B00B0A5XQU|5.0|I usually wait for all Macomber's books but especially those about Blossom Street.  It is wonderful to meet all the characters from earlier books and wonder what the newest characters will be doing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Keeps you in suspense. Great easy read, hard to put down. If you are a fan of the movie hunger games I highly recommend reading this.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really thought the book was dragging on during WOOL-1, but then eveything got very interesting.  I had a hard time putting it down, fully baited into wondering what was going to happen next.  After finishing WOOL-5 I'm desperate!  What is going to happen next?  Will the silos get together?  Is there going to be a collapse of the society? The author has a great story line, and I probably have revealed too much in this review, but without being ultra techie (actually very down to earth) the author has developed a great setting for many seductive stories yet to be told. I highly recommend it.
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|This is an Interesting story about the WWII American & German flight crews.  The story about the writer was also quite interesting.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A remarkable discussion on creativity and invention.  If you know anything about the creative and inventive process you recognize what a great job the author has done in describing it.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  We love her music and this movie shows how sweet she is and where that sweetness comes from.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I was originally quite pleased with the game and enjoyed the time I spent developing my town , trying to maximize bonuses from decorations and deciding which animals to make a habitat for ... And then I went and spent a portion of my limited income on buying the near-impossible-to-obtain acorns and accidentally clicked on an empty piece of ice while scrolling and bought the useless plot of empty ice. It was frustrating in the extreme, but more so was the trite, delayed auto-response kicked back by the so-called Customer Service. With no confirmation on buying town space, no option to sell it back, and no help from Customer Service, and the ridiculous rarity of acorns, I can't recommended playing this game. In the future, l will buy a sustainable game and avoid &quot;free&quot; games that rely on in-game content purchases.
0345803493|5.0|I had listened to this on audio book and loved the 2 main characters- their issues and what they did to be together.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It is an okay read but nothing special. I loved all of his early books - The Firm, The Client , and The Pelican Brief, but this one is just mediocre.
0345803507|5.0|Great books all three!..I wish there were more than the trilogy because I couldn't wait to end the first so I could read the second..Not a big bookreader but these were books I couldn't put down
B004XUMMFE|5.0|A fun sci-fi, great cast, maybe better than Star Trek Next Generation.  Like most sci-fi, does require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief.  Great strong women characters.
159463176X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. However, my sister-in-law and I both discussed 2 chronological mistakes occurring in the book after she brought this up and I agree.<br />The first is on Page 64 where Nabi states in the sentence that begins \\"I met her in 1949\\" which doesn't make sense and Nabi staes he was born in 1946,  and then on Page 85 it states \\"Pari was 6 years old at the time\\" but she wasn't she was 3. A little confusing, but a worthy read none the less.
0880796863|5.0|I purchased this deck to study the original cards.  I collect many decks it's hard to study all at once, so I figured if I purchased the original series I could just study those and it might be easier to transition to another series.  They are not as pretty as some of my other decks but I like them because they look old and classic.

B00785P2QC|4.0|moves faster than paradise cove.  can not wait until I can rebuild a bridge.  hope that I do not have to buy a bunch in this game.
B009NY43NY|4.0|But I still didn't like it.  Charlaine Harris seems to have brought tons of characters that we never thought we'd see again, which is fun, but I personally don't care for who Sookie is sleeping with this time!
B0049MPHH6|4.0|A funny, honest and easy read. Sedaris has a modern sensibility and it comes across effortlessly. Some stories better than others. Very enjoyable.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|LOts of fun for the whole family.  Easy to play.  My kids love it and so do I. Great to take places where waiting in line is a thing.
B003N7GATM|4.0|I like the mix of songs on this EP. They showcase a range of musical talent and ability that holds great promise.

B004YTGRMI|5.0|what is there not to love.great album and the extra's are great fun.can't miss.all the extra music is of great interest to rem fans
B00CW665VI|5.0|Brilliant is an understatement! This book was laugh out loud, shake your head and wish you could be as sarcastic and quick witted as Drew and Kate! I loved their banter and love/hate relationship. There is nothing quiet like an entire book from the male perspective...especially when it makes your smirk and shake your head at the same time. The story was fun, lighthearted and kept me glued to every word...not one second of skimming here! While I loved Drew and Kate...Mackenzie warmed my heart. There is something about an adorable 4-year old and a Bad Word Jar that just makes you watch your language, but enjoy when others have to pony up! I will read this book again as it made me laugh and smile at the most inappropriate things.<br /><br />Emma did an amazing job from the male POV and my fingers are crossed for more from her. I truly hope for more with Drew and Kate, but wouldn't mind more on Delores and Matthew too!<br /><br />Now...to go work on the sky writer to congratulate her on her success and maybe send a thousand balloons. I'll spare her the singing trio...
B000VWYNNW|5.0|i have alway's loved celebration day live and since it isn't on the movie,this is the place.plus you get to hear a few they left off the movie and album.you,ll see why.wow
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|It's a well written show as far as TV goes. If your a fan of the show from season one the main two characters are have developed good back stories which is refreshing. If your looking for a show that has the typical crime solving with good humor added in you should give it a chance.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Ok its the Walking Dead... its got Rick, Daryl, Michonne, Glenn, Maggie and the rest of the EXCEPTIONAL cast... superb writing, gripping nail biting moments, tender moments, zombie bashing lol..... who could ask for a better show?? ;p
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Unlike others I've tried this one is loud! Minimal advertising, I barley notice the adverts. The digital face it's set with is cool and clean/sharp looking. You can as far as I can tell, set as many separate alarms as you need. You can't set it for a specific date ahead, but you can set it to repeat an alarm time on the same day every week so you can set it, and every time it goes off leading up to the day you need reminding to do something even a month away, it's like a count down of weekly reminders to the day of. And you could change the message each time, &quot;2 weeks&quot;, then &quot;next week&quot; and &quot; TODAY!!!&quot; etc. I'll try others but I'll bet I'll end up paying the .99&cent; for the full advert free one. Love it.

B004EF8AJA|5.0|Great movie, I have watched in many times. The acting is great and it has romance with the right amount of drama.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I've been seeing a lot of mixed reviews mostly regarding the bands move to using synthesizers and ditching some guitar work, a common move in this new technology/electronic age growing rapidly throughout the world. I find this record to be quite a gem in Thirty Seconds to Mars' discography mainly because each record has its own identity and this one's is the most unique and creative in my opinion. While I love their first two records, both of them have such common elements of alternative rock and post-grunge while their last two records blend so many awesome genres that the music just speaks for itself regarding how awesome and creative it is. I personally the love the record, I wouldn't change a thing about it. I do not call those who have been long time fans 'traitors' if they don't particularly like the album because it is certainly a departure from their previous endeavors. I do however believe that people should keep an open mind and honestly they should just appreciate the music and what it means not only to themselves but to other people. Mow back to the record, I will now proceed by conducting a song by song review with a few words describing why the rate the song that appropriate rating. Enjoy.<br /><br />1. \\"Birth\\" 9/10 - It's a strong opening, something that pumps up the listeners, prepares them for the excitement that proceeds after the brief introduction. I love the brass section, so strong, powerful, great opener.<br /><br />2. \\"Conquistador\\" 9/10 - One of the more rock oriented songs on the record, great riff, great lyrics, terrific vocals. One thing I've always loved about 3STM is Jared's strong vocals and powerful delivery. This record in my opinion properly projects Jared's magnificent voice.<br /><br />3. \\"Up in the Air\\" 10/10 - It took me a couple tries to like this song when it was first released as a single because I wasn't used to the electronic 3STM. Once again, the vocals are very powerful and the lyrics are inspiring. The guitar riff is incredibly catchy but my favorite part is the breakdown with the pounding drums, it's the little things on this record that I enjoy so much. Overall, one of the best songs on the record, it really grew on me and I consider it a masterpiece.<br /><br />4. \\"City of Angels\\" 10/10 - My god, what a song, the lyrics are beyond jaw-dropping, the little piano flurries are just beautiful. Another reason I love 3STM is their use of multiple instruments, choirs, orchestras, it's just a great blend and it works so well, especially on this song. I cannot describe how beautiful the second verse is with Jared's dual recorded vocals, the lyrics, did I talk about those yet, absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />5. \\"The Race\\" 9/10 - Great song, violin riff is an original way to start a song, the lyrics are of course beautiful. It took me a while to get into the chorus, I just found it a little strange but it has grown on me and I truly enjoy this song. The addition of the guitar later in the song is nice to hear but by this point in the record, I have begun appreciating their new musical approach, very inspiring, very unique.<br /><br />6. \\"End of All Days\\" 9/10 - Very gospel like song, Jared's vocals are amazing, the pianos are lovely, this is a true ballad with soul. I really hear Queen blended with Muse in this song, it's very beautiful. I haven't much to say about this song when it comes to particulars mainly because it's just a tremendous progressive electronic song without highlights within the song.<br /><br />7. \\"Pyres of Varanasi\\" 10/10 - I love this! An instrumental with a beat and soul. The violin riff is so catchy, the synths are energetic, the orchestra is strong (sounds like Inception score), great backbone, great employment of obscure instruments and vocal sounds, great song!<br /><br />8. \\"Bright Lights\\" 10/10 - The lyrics are the real highlight of this song, beautiful expression of words behind some great synth effects and a catchy beat. It's one of those songs that you're not sure if your going to like which was my impression when I first listened to it. I fell love after a couple listens though, it's a grandiose, powerful song, love it! One of the highlights.<br /><br />9. \\"Do or Die\\" 11/10 - This is a song that has been receiving acclaim from most of fans and hell yes I'm going to jump on the bandwagon. This song is energetic, powerful, catchy, there isn't a reason to love it. This is Thirty Seconds to Mars at there best, when everything melds and converges beautifully. One of the highlights, the second best song on the record in my opinion.<br /><br />10. \\"Convergence\\" 9/10 - I like it, wasn't sure if I liked it for a while. The xylophone gets a little irritating but I grew to love it along with the continuing progression of instruments joining the beat. Shannon writes great instrumentals, I wish there was a little more action but I appreciate the progressive nature and the beauty behind the instruments.<br /><br />11. \\"Northern Lights\\" 12/10 - The absolute best song on the record, from the strange opening riff, to the pulsing bass drum beat, to the attractive synths to the incredibly awesome chorus with the raging vocals. The lyrics are awesome, the vocals are loud, proud, and so strong. This song has everything to me, I love it!<br /><br />12. \\"Depuis Le Debut\\" 9/10 - Kind of like 100 Suns except much better in my opinion, it's a pretty song but not exactly the way I would of ended the record. The lyrics sum it up nicely but I would of either liked this song to be a full song or a song to precede this one. The synth riff though is very catchy and the orchestra is very 'a propos' to sum up the feel of the record. It's the end of an incredible journey.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this record enough, it's not often that I can say that I walked away from a record blown away by the originality. It's not as long as their previous effort nor close to has heavy as their first two records but it has its own voice, it's own purpose and Irespect that. Buy it, download it, I don't care, just listen to it, give it a chance, walk in with an open mind and you won't be sorry.

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|As an adult who played and still on occasion plays video games this is a fun movie you can enjoy with your children. Every time we sit down to watch Wreck-it Ralph I find new Easter eggs I have previously missed. There are more subtle references, such as a brief look at &#34;Aerith Lives&#34; in Graffiti. The movie itself is a very adorable tale of a &#34;bad guy&#34; who wants to win a medal so he can fit in with the other characters for his arcade game. Going to other arcade games he ends up at Sugar Rush, where he helps a little girl with a glitch.
B009MYARIK|1.0|This is a major disappointment. I loved \\"Twenties Girl\\", \\"Remember Me?\\" and \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\".  This is pure farce and not witty, just sophomoric and silly. It is embarrassing that an author with real talent would try to sell her fans this drivel. The rent must be due. Shame on you Sophie Kinsella.
B00003OSU4|5.0|Amateur photographers added a perspective that would have been lost with professional photographers.  Opportunity to see Anita O'Day at her best.  The &#34;clean cut&#34; audience of that era is worth observing.  Great historical document with Mahalia Jackson & Chuck Berry performing.  Loved the scene of amateur musicians &#34;jamming&#34; in a Newport home.
0440237688|5.0|and still love it as an adult. i wanted my step daughter to read it.. but i refer it as my copy so i can have my son read it when he is old enough. this is what i call a classic. and the small bit of wear on the book just makes it that more appealing for this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|At this point one more flattering review of The Hunger Games Trilogy is little more than a statistic, padding for a transcendent franchise. What I will take a moment to say is that this series is one of those rare things in life that does not disappoint. If you want to read an adventure, set in a unique and imaginative world, that has fully realized characters than this a great series.

6305622914|5.0|As a college professor steeped in social theory, I ignored this film until it was brought to my attention through the writings of feminist geographers, Julie Graham and Katherine Gibson, who discuss this film in their last book, \\"A Postcapitalist Politics.\\"  On the surface, this film is appealing in a number of ways, from the slapstick comedy to the provocative promise of \\"the full monty,\\" itself!  But social scientists could--and should--appreciate this film for its exploration of how identities (masculine and feminine) are currently being transformed via the ongoing process of \\"de-industrialization\\" in \\"first-world\\" countries.  At its core, this film is about unemployed men learning to experience an all-too-often unavailable sense of joy in their freedom from the daily grind of wage labor for someone else's profit.<br /><br />  Gibson-Graham, the academic authors, contrast this film with another film about the emasculation of unemployed workers in England:  the flim, \\"Brassed Off\\" (released during the same time period).  If you liked \\"The Full Monty,\\" you should definitely watch \\"Brassed Off,\\" and vice versa.  Then, consider how these films confront de-industrialization from very different perspectives.

B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Director J.J. Abrams and his cast ensemble manage to both channel the most compelling character aspects of the original series cast, while creating new openings for &#34;Star Trek:  The Next-Next Generation.&#34;  A notable departure from TOS is that Kirk, as portrayed by Chris Pine, is a much more vulnerable and fallible figure.  But this is appropriate, since the film starts with his youth, in which Kirk has made a series of poor life decisions that eventually lead to his impulsive choice to join Starfleet.<br /><br />  The rest, as they say, is &#34;history,&#34; but this is an &#34;open history&#34; in which Kirk may develop as a very different character than the one portrayed by Shatner in TOS.  For Chris Pine, I imagine that this prospect might be a bit daunting, as: a) living up to the Kirk character that Shatner popularized isn't necessarily part of the agenda; and b) Pine might worry about becoming &#34;pigeonholed&#34; or &#34;typecast&#34; as Kirk, given the enormity of the Star Trek fan base.<br /><br />  From my own perspective, I would be very happy if Pine embraced the role of Kirk and developed it through a series of movies.  I would also be happy to see a new TV series at some point--but with the great writing and production values exhibited by the &#34;reboot&#34; of Battlestar Galactica.  It would be fantastic if Pine, Quinto, and their peers would be willing to offer us such a gift.<br /><br />  In any case, the first of the &#34;new&#34; Star Trek movies was a great success, and I look forward to the latest film, &#34;Into Darkness&#34;!

B0053O89JM|5.0|Season Eight dealt with some really heavy themes in a way that keeps you fascinated by the cast and invested in House. I won't post spoilers but I will tell you that the last episode of the series is done so perfectly, it wraps up all the threads and leaves you satisfied and happy with where the story leads you, and if you're like me you'll probably cry because it's so perfect. So happy they ended this show well!

0307987647|4.0|Well, with the second book done and I'm over 50% into the third book, little annoyances are building with the enormous repetition.  I have been listening to the audiobooks mostly and when I have a spare moment I sit down and read it on my kindle, but with the amount of uses and reuses, and phrases and rephrasing and yada blah, etc. I have even found myself wanting dear old Hodor to bite the dust, just so I wouldn't have to hear his voice anymore. I just want to listen to the book and let the story unfold, but the narrator keeps yelling Hodor, Hodor, Hodor. Hoooooodor in different octaves and combinations of inflection.  Yeah, that is kinda annoying after a while.<br /><br />As I had stated before I watched the first two seasons as a little assist before tackling the books, but with this installation there are many more differences in the book than the show. For that reason I am not watching the current season as I read A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />Once again though G.R.R.M. does a good job crafting plots and making me like one character only to turn my back on that person before the book is done, and I guess what he eventually wants to try with me is to have me hate one individual and then develop a fondness for them later, but that won't work with me. I hold grudges, and I won't be swayed, but I will definitely admit it down the line if I eventually forgive a character.<br /><br />Just as the first book had several irritants in the details this one does the same. Sometimes a reader just wants the meat of the story and sometimes sure you can go into detail on a particular city, thing, or armor, but mostly as a reader we want the story to push forward with less junk in the way. So here is an example I came up with. This would be something like an important meeting that is supposed to take place and the people are entering the room to talk. Keep in mind it is the conversation that would be the important part:<br /><br />\\"He walked in wearing a red doublet, encrusted with jewels and diamond dust, his hair fiery blond. His chainmail soaked with blood. It was made of iron that had been ravaged from the distant land of Bernith. Bernith was known for its mining villages and the minerals never scarce. High in demand were the rubies especially and the hilt of his sword was swathed in them. His sword was made of Furanium steel, and had taken more than nine lives just this morning. On his plate armor was the traditional naked mermaid of Eldertown. Her boobs were bare and grotesquely large, too large. The mermaid was a symbol of house Gobbledy-gook, and it was a sign of good fortune to see the bare chested mermaiden upon the seas. Their house words had always been, \\"More than a handful\\". The sea that parted the two lands was named The Sea of Three Peaks. The towering jagged rocks that shot up from beneath the ocean floor as if standing guard by the Island of Murrigan. His bracers were made of solid gold, although a silly thing to do, as fighting with such an armor would slow his strokes and it was a wonder he even survived a single battle, but he loved the color and gleam of it, especially on sunny days. But it was the cold days he looked forward too. Cold, wet, stormy days where forces clashed and his gold bracers were covered in his favorite color by the end of the day. Red, the blood of his enemies. For Gunther his enemies had always been the Raiders of Turnok. They had pillaged his townsfolk for years, but tomorrow he'd eat cheese on his eggs. Eggs had been his daily staple from time to time, and every now and again he knew not how long though, he enjoyed a cup of red wine with his roasted duck. Drizzled in mango sauce and oil that would run down his beard. Throw in a couple of scallions and red pepper garnished clams, and light feathering of nutmeg and he would have his fill. Rest would come easy for him those nights, his dreams would conquer his mind with a belly full of such fine food. Normally he would dream of the sea but on those nights he would dream of women, and sometimes play-doh. It brought him back to his childhood when he had those dreams and when he would wake his face bore a smile from ear to ear.\\"<br /><br />So, as you can see these details I just gave are just over the top, and by the time you get through it all and someone says one line or greeting to the other individual, another person enters the room and...<br /><br />\\"Manx walked with a bowlegged step as his greaves glinted with each movement.

At nearly nine and eighty, he was old, like really old. For reasons unknown chicken grease was still running down over his lips and chin from a roasted goat he ate two days past.

His eyes were a burning red, so red in fact they seemed almost red.\\"<br /><br />And then of course it would go into his lineage and who was his father and who was his mother and who raped who and slaughtered what village and who won or lost what tournament eons ago that is not important.<br /><br />Anyway to sum up, the stories are indeed amazing and well crafted, I just think G.R.R.M. needs to strike through many of the details in his rough draft. We get it, it looks like Medieval Times on steroids, most places are desolate and ravaged by war. Some areas have nice castles and are very beautiful. But I don't need to read five hundred extra pages to get the point.<br /><br />I will however give this book 4 stars just for the quality of the dialogue, but the pacing and the extreme misunderstanding of detail placement causes this one to lose a star.se nights he would dream of women, and sometimes play-doh.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I've played dozens of these &quot;solve the mystery&quot; games, and this is my favorite by far! It's the most challenging one I've played, with beautiful graphics and great characters. The storyline keeps you guessing and the mystery element was very well developed. I kept saying to myself that this is one of the more challenging of these games I've played, which I loved! It has a perfect balance of &quot;hidden object&quot; and puzzles/mini games.<br />Had no trouble downloading, and it didn't take long at all. I've played G5 games before, so I knew going in that I would have to pay a few dollars (actually only $2.39, I think) to get the entire game. It was money well-spent. I played this off and on for a couple of days...very enjoyable.<br />My favorite part was the location of the game, which is all set underwater with some scuba diving. &quot;Eden,&quot; the underwater hotel that is the centerpoint of the action, was beautiful and very cleverly laid out. Loved this and can't wait to play the next installment! G5 is definitely my favorite game developers. Keep up the excellent work, guys! You made my Kindle Fire even more enjoyable than it already was!
1451697686|2.0|I've been cloth-diapering for three years and recently have tried to find ways to reduce waste in other areas of our life, so I bought this book hoping for practical tips and advice. Instead, I found myself overwhelmed by the author's suggestions for how to avoid purchasing any food in disposable packaging (glass jars, marking the tare of the cloth bag in pencil -- mind you, a pencil without an eraser), how to pare your wardrobe down to three pairs of socks (does she exercise?), etc. I wanted simple, practical tips, and yes, they're buried in there, but there was too much time spent explaining her forays into making her own mascara and taking care of kefir seeds for me to stay on point.<br /><br />I did takeaway some overall goals (choose glass and metal over plastic; reduce consumerism; adopt reusable, compostable, or less wasteful counterparts to common household items) and a few tips on how to use vinegar to kill weeds and such, but I also feel like it's a bit much to tell people not to have decorative pillows in their bedroom.

1612191290|1.0|A loan is not charity. It is an act between two free and equal parties. One trades liquid capital, and the other trades the promise of future capital. The money supply usually increases. I can spend the money that I have today, but I may be dead before I collect money owed to me tomorrow. When you hold my money in your hands you may decide to run off with it never to return. People start their working lives richer in potential labor but hungry for money, while those same people when older will usually be poorer in potential labor but richer in money. The promise of money has considerably less liquidity than money. In short, $1 today is not the same as $1 tomorrow. For all of these reasons, if I ask for a loan the amount that I should pay in the future needs to be larger in order for the trade to be equitable -- if I insist that the creditor must give me a loan with zero interest, then no creditor would ever take me up on the offer. It's pretty darn amazing that interest rates can be as low as they are, when you consider just how much more valuable a bird in the hand is than a bird in the bush.<br /><br />The author, instead of actually attempting to understand and argue these fundamental questions of money and value, uses the conjurer's trick of pretending that $1 today is worth precisely $1 tomorrow. Rather than arguing against the economic arguments made by Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Menger, Mises, Hayek or Friedman, Graeber spends his first chapter pretending that a popular just-so story in economics (one of equal traders in a market-place, looking for a common medium of exchange) is the cornerstone of economic argument; and having presented his straw dummy, he argues against it. In fact, though, popular mediums of exchange do arise -- note the article in the New York Times which demonstrates how liquid Tide became an urban inner-city currency in exactly the same manner as Menger predicted \\"money\\" would spontaneously emerge in any diversified economy. http://nymag.com/news/features/tide-detergent-drugs-2013-1/ The rest of the book confounds statistics on average income distribution over time with the actual reality of social mobility (in which very few people within liberal Western democracy that start in the lowest 20th percentile of wealth, are still there after 20 years have passed).m/news/features/tide-detergent-drugs-2013-1/ The rest of the book confounds statistics on average income distribution over time with the actual reality of social mobility (in which very few people within liberal Western democracy that start in the lowest 20th percentile of wealth, are still there after 20 years have passed).

B007SGLZP8|5.0|The plot was very interesting, typical Grisham Story; difficult to put down. The characters and settings are vividly described. A Good Purchase.
0307744434|1.0|This book got recommended to me by someone I've had a good track record with.  Almost always the books they suggest appeal to me in some way.  This was the first book where once I finished it I started to have serious doubts about everything I thought I knew about this person.  Were they punishing me?  Did they even read it?  Have they ever read any of the books they suggested to me?<br /><br />The Night Circus is full of the most gratuitous, boring, and pretentious writing I've ever witness.  80% of the book is descriptions of clothes, food or circus tents.  I mean WORDY descriptions.  Like a college freshman trying to impress someone with their first creative writing assignment.  Words just puked all over the place for no real reason.  The characters are not developed AT ALL.  I know their names, maybe what their house or apartment looks like and that's about it (oh and of course what clothes they like to wear).  Then there is the whole issue with the plot.  Which is to say there isn't one.  There is a circus, a game no one really seems to care about that is never explained and once finished has no real consequences.  There is no tension and no resolution.  No real antagonist even.  It's just a vague idea about a plot that sounds promising but just falls very flat.<br /><br />I would steer very clear of this title.  They won't refund your money and more importantly they can't refund your time.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A young attorney had been grinding his way through the world of international bonds, stuck in a back room of a large, impersonal but high pressure law firm in downtown Chicago when he suddenly decided to quit - just walk away. He wandered into a small, two attorney office in a more run-down part of town, whose approach to gaining clients was chasing ambulances, and suing for damages. After hiring on as a third attorney, the office stumbled into a class-action lawsuit against a medical drug company.<br /><br />Thinking they would ride the coat tails of other higher priced national law firms, and reap the harvest of this &#34;sure thing&#34;, they were stunned to find the medical drug company had decided to target one of their clients and force them into a lone trial in front of a Chicago Federal Judge. Separated from their class-action legal team this small office is forced to learn the hard way how to litigate a tough case in a Federal Court against a team of hired guns that has not lost a trial verdict in any of their past twenty-one cases.<br /><br />The load falls on the shoulders of our young attorney, as his legal partners find ways to back off the Federal Case, at times abandoning the young attorney in court. The book, well written by John Grisham, follows the personal growth of the young attorney as he battles to survive his first trial. A captivating book. Loved it.
B00BQHA0UQ|4.0|Some of the songs on the album sound similar to each other and to his past works, but overall, this is a great album by Carlos Vives. I'm not the biggest fan of \\"Como le gusta a tu cuerpo\\", but it's still a pretty catchy tune. \\"Volvi a Nacer\\", which was another song that was released as a single, is, in my opinion, the highlight of the album. I have also found myself enjoying some of the other tunes. In fact, it's hard to find a song that I didn't like on the album.
1451695195|5.0|Very inspiring and a great book to make you think.  I would recommend this book to anyone who just needs a &#34;lift&#34;.  Very good book and written by an adult who &#34;lived through this experience&#34;.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I wish it that it was longer and somebody can tell me how to download minecraft for free and the full addition
B00BE909NO|5.0|I love stories like this where you get swept up in the narrative, the characters, the emotions but are still fascinated by the details of another place and time.  Very real and rang true.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Great American Music. Quality song interpretation, flawless execution, song choices that make us consider how our racial culture has changed (and not always favorably).  Plus, its just damn fun music.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It's easy to get hooked on the Fifty Shades books, I found.  This isn't deep thought by any means.<br />However, they are fun, although the sex is repetitive ...ad nauseum.  It's the psychology of Grey's<br />&#34;darkness&#34;  that keeps me reading.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|The tour last year was so great (saw them twice)so how could this album anything less, right? It is great such as it is but where are the rest of the songs? A recording of the show on NPR had high quality versions of All Summer Long, Dance Dance Dance and Do You Wanna Dance but here they are MIA. Also missing are It's OK, Cottonfields & several others. These discs clock in at around 1 hour each so it isn't for lack of space. I made a copy to play in my car where I added the 3 NPR songs to the 1st disc & they match up perfectly & the home made disc is still under 70 minutes. For the other songs I only had a fairly low quality audiance recording that didn't match up with the CD so I added them by themselves, plus the acoustic performance the did for Rolling Stone, after the end of the 2nd disc & with all that it's still around the 70 minute mark. Even with these complaints I still wholeheartedly recommend this album to anybody who likes the Beach Boys. I've been a fan since seeing them at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium in 1964 & depite the loss of 2 key members this is a wondeful rememberance of an incredible tour. Too bad Mike had to be an idiot at the end of this tour to drop Brian, Al,David and the members of Brian's band and go back to soiling the Beach Boys name with his tribute bar band quality, in name only Beach Boys joke. That isn't really fair....I've seen Beach Boys tributes that were much better than Mike's band. I can't wait for the Brian, Al & David show with Brian's band in LA later this year. Brian is the real keeper of the flame.
B00C061HZY|5.0|This review is on both the album itself and the vinyl edition of the album.<br /><br />The album:<br />The album is a very good album. However, it should be noted that its different than their past stuff. The album is basically Daft Punk doing Disco music. Normally, I hate Disco. However, this album is a rare exception. They seem to have managed to take all of the redeemable aspects of Disco and combine it with their signature sound. That being said, the album is also very interested because it features Daft Punk working with a full band on the songs and even an orchestra on some of the material. The album features contributions by big names like Nile Rodgers (Cher), Pharrell Williams (N.E.R.D., The Neptunes), and Paul Williams. In addition to the big names, the music features experienced session musicians that have worked on some very famous recordings like Michael Jackson's Thriller.<br /><br />The vinyl:<br />The vinyl edition of the album features the album spread over two 180 gram 12\\"s. These twelve inches are housed in a gatefold sleeve that also houses a card with a code to download the album and a few page booklet that features the album's credits (who played on what) and the lyrics to the songs. After listening to both the vinyl and the mp3s that come with the record, I would have to say that the vinyl is highly superior in sound quality. Even though I listened to both versions on the same speakers, I was surprised that the mp3s did not had the same in-depth low end groove that the vinyl did. After doing some reading on the album online, I found out that the album was almost exclusively recorded in analog with high end gear. Because of this, it makes sense that the vinyl edition sounds better.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Daft Punk does Disco. I very much like the album. It features Daft Punk going an interesting direction that almost seems to a beautiful 180 from what the majority of popular artists are doing. However, if you expect to hear old school Daft Punk, I would recommend that you check out some of the tracks before you buy the album. Some of my favorite songs are \\"Get Lucky\\", \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\", and \\"Doin' It Right\\". In closing, I will note that the vinyl edition may be a bit of leap price wise but I strongly believe that it sounds better.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I read this in pretty much a day it was a fun read in a male point of view I loved the come backs that Kate had for Drew they made me laugh so if your looking for a fun easy read this book is for you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always love a good novel by Nicholas sparks and once again he wows me! Have yet to read a book I didn't love or couldn't read over and over again :) Amazing author...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game beside minecraft 5 stars from me all of those who look at this app GET IT!!!!!!!!! and if you don't get it well.. get it some other time
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I enjoyed this book!  The story shows a stark contrast of Catherine's life as a party girl when she meets Lee.  To her paranoia and fear after she gets away from Lee.  It's a Sleeping With the Enemy (Julia Roberts movie) type story, although her crazy ex-does go to prison for a time and he knows she's alive.<br /><br />One thing that did get a little old was reading and re-reading about all of her &#34;checking&#34;.  I totally understood why she was doing it, I didn't feel the reader needed to read about each step of her checking process over and over.  And thankfully at some point the writer does back off on each individual step to just say she went through her checking.  But I felt I got it after the first couple of times.  Over all I did enjoy the book.
0812982622|4.0|If you are intrigued by North Korea, as I am, this novel will give you a most vivid and fascinating picture of life inside the secluded country. The novel traverses many aspects of North Korea's social and political landscape, taking you on a journey into villages and cities, orphanages and political prison camps, factories, fishing vessels, movie sets and beyond. The grand scope of the protagonist's journey may stretch the bounds of believability, but the fascinating world it depicts and the themes of love, identity and sacrifice that underpin the story are highly engaging. It is a challenging novel at times - for example, in its depiction of violence and the brutality of everyday life, and also structurally through the narration of the second half of the novel from three different perspectives.  Ultimately, however, the book is very rewarding, highly ambitious and original, and beautifully written.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I loved every minute of this mini-series. The Benedict Cumberbach was excellent as Sherlock Holmes, he was perfect in this role. He truly make Sherlock come alive on the screen.
B0001AP13A|2.0|This vinyl came in the new packaging and it was a new vinyl and it came scratched pretty well and was somewhat worn too. The disc one a side was scratched across the first four tracks and didn't work. This makes me wonder if it was a repackaged old vinyl. Either way it came severely depreciated from what I thought I purchased.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has very interesting characters and will totally surprise you.  God help us if there are really people like that in this world.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a different sort of romance because it is told from the male character's point of view and only that. It is as if Drew is telling us the story of how he and Kate got together. We live inside his head and he tells us how guys think in hilarious detail. I loved the book. It is not an angst filled relationship, there is no mystery or drama; just the story. It is an easy read, but you won't want to put it down.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What a phenomenal story - the mental strength to survive this ordeal is something almost super human.  The love these guys have for their country, their brothers in arms, and the honor they hold in the hearts makes me proud to be an American.  We can all learn a lot from them.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I have very much enjoyed using twitter on the tablet. You can see many things it once, which is good if you are someone who sometimes catches up several hours of tweets that have to be flipped through. It is a bit hard to deal with pictures on the tablet since the Kindle Fire has no camera. However, you can see pictures on a much larger screen than on phones.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is some story - and brotherhood plays a huge part in it.  It broke my heart when I heard Chris was killed.  Read it in memoriam and know this was a good guy.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great stories from a great hero,<br />Excellent book Chris just tells it like it is, pulls no punches in the accounts of his many encounters. He even opens his personal life and family struggles.<br />Buy the book support his family.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This story is so unique - I never saw it coming!  I won't say more but it's a great read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful graphics and great story line. Like most of the other reviews I only wish it was longer. Would gladly pay more for a longer/bigger game. Hard to put it down.
B00999DFP0|5.0|Probably one of the best shows ever created.  If you are buying this, then that is not something I need to elaborate on.  The quality of this package was great.  It was well packaged and put together.  And I say this because I have been disappointed in the past with DVD sets showing up looking rather “bootleg.” I am overall pleased with this purchase.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|never was able to down load so can't really rate what you haven't played. Bought but never was able to down load when I go back in it wants me to purchase it again.
B007ZYJMU8|4.0|The movie was not quite what I expected, but if you don't mind movies dealing with tough topics this is a good one to check out. The actors were very natural and believable.

B008XG1X18|3.0|First annoyance is the crashing. If I tap a pin to open the website, 8 times out of 10 I'm told to &quot;force close&quot; because the app is unresponsive. Pinning is also a pain with the app. You have to copy the website and create a pin. The toolbar add-on for the PC is just so much easier. But when my kids are hogging the PC, the app will curb my desperation.

141659521X|5.0|Mitch Rapp stories are extremely interesting and current politics and variations on various governments are very interesting . I have read all his books and usually preorder new release in Hard cover and crash through it the  first few days after it comes out.<br />  Vince has created wonderful characters both in the CIA and the terrorist organizations . Cannot wait for first movie to be released.<br />His description of International intrigue is absolutely First Class.<br /> Have read his books more than once about a year apart and they are just as interesting . Have most of his books in Hard Cover .
B00CW665VI|5.0|I've never read a book that was written in this manner. It was absolutely amazing. It had it all. Love, sex, romance, comedy... And I loved Drew's little niece. They were all great character's.

0446572993|2.0|I have been a David Baldacci fan for years.  I love the Camel Club series.  I was so excited when I came across this book at a flea market.  I thought the story started out well but after the first few chapters it started to fizzle.  I didn't connect with any of the characters.  And the 14 year old was probably the character I should have had the most sympathy for but I had none.  By the end of the book I was confused and just didn't care about the story at all.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Repeated opening of free treasure chests do not add to the total amounts.  Why have a treasure chest in the first place.  The level up totals are too high and make it hard progress.  If you want to spend money the amounts are really off base considering the fact that you do not get anything that is of intrinsic value.  The fact that you can lose everything if your device fails lends one to believe using money is not an option.  My device failed and lost progress on all games since the support side for cloud games are non-existent.  I contacted what they tout as support with little or no results.  They state they need the device ID  when you can not access the device. Some store progress on cloud where some do not.  Even though you register using your email they can not retrieve the necessary data .  There is not an easy way to contact support. They also do not have a user manual.  My advice Don't use real money.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Starts out well but bogs down quickly. Characters act without purpose and have long drawn out conversations on topics that don't have much to do with the plot. The book seems to go on and on and on. It's good for insomnia.

Matt Berninger's voice sizzles...so are the tunes...really liked songs, Fireproof, Need my Girl......the entire album is a must buy and must listen....so what r u waiting for....??..the good stuff carries on from Bloodbuzz Ohio....
1451668945|5.0|I love Mary . I have all her books in hard cover. This story kept me guessing almost to the end . I couldn't put it down after about the middle of the book. I had to find out who did it. Thank god it was a rainy day and I could stay in my chair an was able to finish it.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Well it isn't, and we were given fair warning of this.  Too many people think that this is going to have a heavy pounding floor romper, mosh pit, track list, like Discovery did.(One More Time and harder, better faster, stronger, ect...). But RAM to me, is one of a kind.  Daft Punk wanted to do something different and inspired, so different and inspired it was! Too many people here just cant seem to grasp the music aspect of the album.  Its not just music to dance to, its emotion, its music, its art.  Daft Punk wants you to listen to it.  Every song has a feel and groove of its own.  IF YOU WERE EXPECTING DISCOVERY 2.0.  BETTER CHANGE THAT LINE OF THINKING BUSTER!  This is New Daft Punk.  And frankly, I like it.  (You might.  You might not.  All I know is, I love it.)<br /><br />Although...  I do feel like the last track, Contact, was in a weird way... a homage to the Discovery days.  (SUPER AMAZING TRACK BY THE WAY!)
193700788X|4.0|I burned though this book in just a couple of days of receiving it. This title has the same trademark wit, humor, detail, and story telling as Harris' other works. I enjoyed the story, though the feeling was bittersweet as this is the last Sookie Stackhouse novel. Having said that, I felt that some parts were rushed and there were so many favorite characters involved that the story passed by rather quickly. I would still recommend this book to anyone that enjoyed the previous Sookie tales.
B005R32L66|5.0|wherever I am, I can get to talk and see any of my contacts at any time and for free which is even better. Besides thecnical issues that I am sure have nothing to do with the app but the connections, it is perfect.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|Great album, can't believe after all of this years they still produced an album that stands up with their prior work...great job.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Well written, historically accurate, emotionally involving.  A good read for anyone interested in World War 2 history.  Gives insight into Germany at war and reminds one that absolutes are rare, people are not all bad and all good.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is good but i found a bug that when you copy a world it doesnt render fully fix please this happens on ios too.
0812984412|2.0|This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but I found the experience of reading totally joyless. It is very long, and not an easy read. I only finished the book because of my personal commitment to finish things I've started, I definitely didn't care what happened to any of the characters and was not excited for any of the resolutions. The author took on too much and I did not care to read his overarching vanity project.
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|Great book with lots of common sense advice, things we are familiar with but hesitate to apply to ourselves and our business.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those who are planing on starting their own business especially for the first timers.

B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Although I wouldn't consider this book a huge literary achievement it is engaging and entertaining.  The main Character Vaelin I found mezmorising watching him change from a fairly innocent boy to a young man/boy with enormous courage, compassion and intelligence.  It was a good read and I look forward to a sequel.

I don't just purchase vinyls for the record but I like to display the jacket itself.  This album came in some generic blk jacket with a poor sticker copy of the CD booklet!!  Oh well, I have it now and there's no real reason to return it.  I still plan to enjoy listening to it on my record player!<br /><br />A few hours later.....okay I had to lower the rating.  Side 2 is completely scratched and this SUPPOSE to be a brand NEW album!!!  What a waste.  I wasted my $5 credit on this mess!!!  Amazon u need to remove this item immediately!!! I really want to ship this scratch fest back!!!!!

B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I bought this hoping to get a movie of texture and complexity that I could watch many times and get something new out of it every day.<br /><br />I didn't need the morality of hollywood slammed up into my face over and over.<br /><br />I haven't read the books and I'm looking at this only from seeing the actual movie.<br /><br />I've watched it twice and although I do like alot of it I cannot and I will not abide it's portrayal of queer sex and suicide as acceptable.<br /><br />I also totally reject out of hand the communist/collectivist drivel that it keeps repeating as dogma.<br /><br />\\"Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.\\"<br /><br />This maybe good for buddhists or communists but it is NOT American or even culturally western.<br /><br />I wanted a decent film with texture and depth, I didn't need or want a dogmatic paen to post modern collectivism.<br /><br />I other words I didn't pay money to be lectured to by anybody let alone these arrogant collectivist tools.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this movie if I had it all over to do.<br /><br />I sure wouldn't let non-adults to watch it.<br /><br />I wanted to love this movie.<br /><br />Oh well ...
B00BESM14U|3.0|Although this is another very watchable teen coming-of-age movie, there is one point where it entirely lost any semblance of credibility. The kids portrayed are supposed to be the cool hipster outsider crowd. They hear a song they fall in love with on the radio and yet are unable to figure out who sings it. So, if you haven't seen the movie, you're thinking it's some obscure artist that even the hip kids haven't discovered yet.<br /><br />That song--\\"Heroes\\" by David Bowie.<br /><br />Seriously, you're telling me they wouldn't have (a) been able to recognize Bowie's incredibly unique voice or (b) known about this song as it was on the freakin' radio meaning it's as mainstream as you can get in what I believe is the late '70s.<br /><br />Sorry, I just could not take the premise seriously after that despite some fine performances.<br /><br />The extras are decent but again once you hear the director and producer talk about what this movie is about you then again begin to call into question their sensibilities.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can do so much I thos that if you want to oun this game you will know you want it has mutiplayer
B0067EKY7M|5.0|On so many levels this story is wonderful and onscreen even better. The premise is hilariously out there but everyone plays their role with such earnestness and joy, it seems entirely plausible. Look, Emily Blunt is a treasure in anything she's in so that's a given she is going to be good. What is surprising is Ewan McGregor who can be so hit and miss in romantic leading roles (check out The Island and you'll see what I mean). In this playing totally against \\"movie\\" type as a Scottish fisheries expert living in London ... wait a second, McGregor is in fact Scottish, lives in London and may in fact be a fisheries expert for all we know.<br /><br />Anyway, he'd great in it as is Egyptian actor Amr Waked who plays the visionary sheikh with money and ideas to burn.<br /><br />On the DVD the extras are short and first-rate. We get a nice inside story on how the Yemen valley scene was shot \\"backwards\\" in film sequence (SPOILER ALERT ahead) from flood scene first to construction phase last. Also, is a nice interview with the author, Paul Torday, of the novel which formed the basis of the movie.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Get a beer and popcorn and prepare to step into the pure adventure of earth, once again, being invaded by a powerful and dangerous enemy from who knows where and who knows why they are here. But, if you have seen a dozen other sci-fi films over the last forty odd years, you will know the pattern: the creatures are ugly as a dead rooster laying in the Alabama sun, th lovely gals will be thrust into positions of power and influence and do a mighty fine job, the lowly underlings will toss out a few good one-liners and act terrified but come through for the heroic officer who must figure out the gooners weakness and save this planet. Lots of fun, some obvious 'this ain't gonna work', resilient and reluctant combatants, lots of flaming gigantic spaceships, a seemingly doomed earth.<br />We don't know who and what the aliens are about. But who cares? We figure out (with the visual assistance of dozens of other films) that the creatures want to take over Earth and will stop at nothing to do so. Some pretty nice effects which don't dominate the film as much as I thought they would. Some stiff acting but the action takes up the slack and leads our soggy heroes to toe to toe combat with the Russkies, er, make that aliens with the aid of Might Mo, guns a blazin'. This film is mindless and mirthful for a couple of hours as you take the salt water stained decks and full speed ahead, cutlasses sharpened and load and run out the guns. Mix some old WWII battleship vets and AC/DC then blend in aliens and their fiendish weapons of destruction, toss in some missiles, some sarcastic comments and presto, you have this movie.<br />Yahoo, go for it. There are and have been plenty of worse 'let's conquer the earth' films.<br />Five sixteen point one inch shells for this baby and nice AC-DC song near the end that rocks.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Of course, I wanted to see this season series so much I snapped it up where I could find it, but I did miss the beautiful HD picture on the free Netflix Seasons 1 and 2.  Other than that, this is a fine product.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I watched this movie at the theater.  This is something I rarely do, but did in this case so someone wouldn't inadvertantly tell me what happened.  Was this an action movie? Definitely!  Was it a drama movie? Most assuredly.  Was it a mystery movie?  Absolutely!  This movie had everything one would want in an enjoyable entertainment format.  Did it follow the comic book religiously?  I have no idea, nor do I care.  RDJ nailed it this time boys and girls.  It's worth seeing!  The only thing I wanted to add was that I bought it at eBay with free shipping and it was about $10.00 cheaper
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|A not so sappy love story with some action and suspense. Even the guys will like it! A great movie!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good characters, good plot, good intrigue. Thoroughly enjoyed. Wish part of the end was different, but otherwise, ending was vey good.  Would read another one of his John Puller stories.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy this game and it is not just fun but challenging to. I think if you want a challenge then get this game.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this just about every night to take my mind off the day and get to sleep. It works for me.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book will have you laughing from the first page to the last ! I absolutely loved the dynamics between Kate & Drew. I also loved the way Drew talked to the reader like he was talking to his buddy. I have already recommended this book  all of my friends because it is that good. Kudos to Emma Chase for a well written, totally captivating book. Can't wait to read other books she writes.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The movie is incredible!!  A must see.  Bring a box of Kleenex with you.  The DVD was delivered n perfect condition and in a timely manner.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|better gameplay than the first one and they just updated it to include more challenges. lots of new features and more challenges. playing on my kindle is really easy!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This is a sequal to 'something borrowed' and has a total twist at the end! It was a great book!!
B005LAIHCM|4.0|Very suspensful and  mysterious. We really enjoyed the movie and suspense. It was fun to try and figure out the  ending.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|A co-worker turned me on to this show.  Sherlock Holmes is such a great character.  Can't wait for next season!
B00171LFFK|5.0|Wow! This is such a fabulous album/cd. I highly recommend this cd. Sound quality of this issue is very nice.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Once started could not put it down. excellent early George R R Martin work. Now starting some more early ones
B004EPZ06G|3.0|this movie is funny for abount 25 minutes then it stops being funny right around the part when they find the chinese man under the floor which he was in before the first movie then its like a adventure movie its a shame that the man with the beard is not funny after this part they should gave him some fuuny lines to speak which wold help
B000W11JGG|5.0|I loved it when it came out in fall of 1973, and I still love it. I was amazed at how I remembered all of the lyrics!
B00263HWM8|4.0|Have watched all MI movies, this one doesn't disappoint. MI 1 was not good, but you can see that with MI 2 the director really changed course and to me thankfully.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I haven't seen this yet, but my adult daughter was really taken by it. She gave it a definite thumbs up.
B007EC27QM|5.0|A very wonderful and handy app for my Kindle Fire.  I highly recommend for the price.  Easy to use it works right after downloading.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This puzzle game &quot;the room&quot; is the best puzzle game on the store it is pretty challenging you really have to think but it's really fun and I can't wait until the next chapters come out.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|It is a great game to play, but not for kids - there is a scene involving skeletons that terrified my daughter, partly because it was so sudden and unexpected rather than the scene itself. The game is long and has a lot of good common-sense puzzles and clues that keep it moving along nicely without being too hard and getting stuck. The map was very helpful for finding where I needed to go next rather than aimlessly wandering for something new.
147674355X|5.0|Wow! Collen Hoover has done it again! She has managed to write another book that has totally captivated me from beginning to end. This story had me glued to the pages to see what happens next and just when I thought I had it all figured out she surprised me.<br />I experienced an endless array of emotions while reading \\"Hopeless\\". I laughed, cried, got angry, felt utmost love and passion and I mostly just wanted to bask in the ambience of the enchantment of Sky and Holder.<br />The characters are written with depth and passion and Sky and Holder's first kiss has to be one of the most intense and romantic scenes I have ever read. Ms. Hoover's writing is flawless and everything is intricately woven.<br />Thank you Colleen for creating Sky and Holder and for having them find beauty in the face of profound ugliness and hopelessness.<br />Breathtakingly Beautiful!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|If you enjoyed the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit ( an unexpected journey ) will not promise less.<br />I purchased and will continue to buy all the others when available.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great end to a great series!<br />Chaplains did another outstanding job of keeping me hooked, keeping the energy high, and wrapping up all loose ends. Loved it!
B005KGPC4S|5.0|What an intense movie this is!  As a long time fan of Kevin Smith, I was surprised at how harsh and gritty this flick is.  I loved it.  Michael Parks is pee in your pants scary as Pastor Abin Cooper.  I also like that is not really gory.  I like it when a movie can be really mean and nasty without having blood all over the place.  That's not to say that there isn't any red in Red State.  Oh yes, there will be blood.  John Goodman, of course, is awesome.  I will end my review by quoting Quentin Tarantino off the back of the movie's box, &#34;I #&%*@#! love this movie!&#34;
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Found this game to be highly enjoyable. Reminded me of a much more challenging &quot;escape the room game&quot;. Looking forward to the next chapter.
0307887448|4.0|Ready Player One's biggest attraction is no doubt its pervasive use of 80s gaming and pop culture references. There is no doubt this book was written by and for a hardcore geek obsessed with the 80s. That being said, it won't be particularly special for anyone else.<br /><br />The author, Ernest Cline, is clearly an amateur novelist, considering the mediocre writing, predictable plot, and one dimensional characters. It feels as if he wrote it for self-pleasure more than anything else. The book essentially vomits up the 80s with its hundreds of references to 80s games, music, movies, and TV shows. While this is great for anyone completely in-tune with their inner 80s geek, for those less in-tune it comes off as a seemingly desperate attempt to connect with the reader through a sense of nostalgia. Due to the sheer number of references in the book, most of them have been reduced to a simple name drop. While these make cute little tidbits for those who recognize them, they only make the experience worse for those unfamiliar, as they are often used as the basis for the reader's mental images.<br /><br />The progression of the story is fairly predictable, but still exciting due to the thrill a reader can get from the very nature of an action/adventure novel. Sadly, the worst part is the first third or so of the novel, when Cline is setting the premise for the story. One has to drudge through the dull writing and slow-pace until the first plot twist. At that point, the book begins to shine as an action/adventure novel, with a little romance and drama on the side.<br /><br />The book addresses an interesting question that is becoming more relevant with every waking moment. What will come of humanity when the digital world consumes us? Ready Player One explores the answer to this thoroughly and even provides an answer as to how humanity should behave in a world heavily integrated with the internet.<br /><br />Ready Player One isn't a great novel, but it's certainly a groundbreaking one, sure to give you a smirk if you have the slightest knowledge in 80s gamer culture.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|HAVE NOT GOT IT FIGURED OUT YET, BUT I THINK IT IS A NEAT APP. MAY TAKE A FEW LESSONS TO KEEP IT  FLYING.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|My 10 year old daughter has really taken to this app.  It has helped her a great deal.  Highly recommended.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Love John Corey and his sense of humor.  It is the humor that keeps things moving.  He and Kate are a good team.  Liked the venue better in the two previous novels much better than Yemen.  Good characters and good conclusion.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game, but you may become addicted and then want to purchase all of the expansion packs!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thought I had this story figured out, but it surprised me!  Its been a long time since ive read any scifi. Couldn't put it down!  More please.  ;)
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Lots of explosions, and a &#34;I was expecting an earth-shattering kaboom&#34; moment. I even ignored the silly reason for the alien invasion, it was that good. And the reloading scene at the end was pure poetry.
B005BDZN62|5.0|West Side Story was the first musical I saw onstage, and immediately following it became the first musical I saw on film. The dance turned into fight immediately made an impression, as did the fantastic songs which fill the musical score by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Soundheim. Winner of 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this film version of the classic musical is one of those rare films which are as good as they are memorable.      Taking Romeo and Juliet and updating it to 1950s New York City with music, West Side Story is about the forbidden love between two members of rival gangs. The Jets are a group of white thugs and The Sharks are the Puerto Rican gang members in the neighborhood, and both constantly fight each other. When one of the Jets (Richard Beymer) falls in love with one of the Sharks (Natalie Wood), they think that they can find a way to be together, but the tragedy of the rivalry takes over. This colorful winner of Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design is a vibrant film, and also one with an emotional punch within the storyline.    WEST SIDE STORY IS #2 IN THE REAL MOVIE NEWS LIST OF TOP 5 CLASSIC MUSICALS. TO SEE THE REST OF THE LIST AND MORE VISIT [...]    [...]
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|I love playing this game. It's fun and engaging. Neat concept of learning art and playing a game.  It's addictive. I like the format of having tasks to complete before you can move on in the game. Wish there were more cities to travel to.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin' in the Rain follows the advent of sound in motion pictures, and the rippling effects it had in Hollywood, complete with a reenactment of the most memorable moment of The Jazz Singer (1927). Gene Kelly stars as a silent film star who is forced to reinvent himself when sound becomes a demanding necessity for modern audiences. There are many scenes showing an accurate and comical portrayal of the switch to sound filmmaking, including a particularly memorable sequence in which the microphone is unsuccessfully hidden in numerous locations on set.    The film within the film is a mess in test screenings, mostly because of the awful sound, including a leading actress with a shrill and uncivilized voice that doesn't match the audience's expectations after seeing her elegant beauty in countless silent films. These were problems that were actually dealt with in the early days of sound, with countless foreign actors suddenly out of work because of their troublesome accents. Singin' in the Rain utilizes this chapter in film history to advance the storyline, advancing the plot towards a solution that turns the flop into a successful musical, with up-and-coming actress Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) lending her voice to dub over the voice of irritating film starlet Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen).    As well as Kelly's signature over-the-top fantasy finale number, Singin' in the Rain has some fantastic smaller bits as well. I have always loved \\"Make `Em Laugh,\\" which Donald O'Conner so enthusiastically performs in the role of Cosmo Brown. And there is no denying the simple elegant spectacle of the title number. Who hasn't hummed that tune walking down a rainy street filled with puddles? Seriously, I can't be the only one.    SINGIN' IN THE RAIN IS IN THE REAL MOVIE NEWS LIST FOR TOP FIVE CLASSIC MUSICALS.

B007EE4XKI|5.0|A good start to a new Next Generation series. This appears to be a faithful continuation of the characters I have come to love and enjoy. It is also great to see Data back, even if only in a cameo appearance. Hopefully we will see more of him in future story lines. Definitely worth a five star rating to me.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I recommend this to anyone. I liked that they brought will smith and tommy lee jones back to play as j and K.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was blown away, I couldn't put the book down.I would find myself staying up late at night just to read as much as possible I really recommend reads it, I laughed got chills and cried!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best game ever! This is the best game I purchased for my kindle. Truly entertaining. Sometimes challenging but not too difficult. Enough to make you think. Looking forward to the sequel!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|A great &#34;prequel&#34; to the original Star Trek TV series ! At under $4 for the DVD, it was a steal. It arrived ahead of schedule using free shipping option for 5-8 shipping days. It was brand new as advertised and in pristine condition.<br />Much to my surprise, I was shipped a 2 disc set, with one disc  of &#34;extras&#34;. I decided not to complain about good fortune.<br />The sequel to this movie comes out this month and I look forward to seeing how it compares with the first one.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|The beginning of the movie has some funny parts, then it just becomes depressing. If a couple fought this much in real life then end it!
B00821PCJS|4.0|This series starts slow but picks up the further into it you get.  It is a good science fiction story and worth watching.
B005544V6A|5.0|So glad this finally showed up on Amazon streaming.  We love this show!  Hope season 2 shows up soon!  New season starts in July.
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|I was hoping for more of an action game.  This is the standard matching gem game with a twist.  Yawn!
B004OR199G|5.0|This book is now a true reference book for me.  Kris makes being healthy fun! She is brilliant, and that shows in every word/page of this book.  So much fun to read! There r lots of recipes and tons of inspiration!
B00915G6YE|2.0|Hi. I just finished watching Season 7 and I really enjoyed it. The show itself is good and have been a fan since the start. So the show content I can give a 5 star rating to. What I give the 2 star rating to is the blu-ray edition which contains NO EXTRAS of any kind.. nothing.. nada. No cast interviews, no commentary, Absolutely zero. I have many other TV series on Blu Ray such as Fringe and True Blood, just to name a few, that are loaded with extras. When you buy this season know that all you get are the episodes and thats it. You can thank Showtime for cutting corners on this one. They could have added things but chose not to. Very disappointed.
0307341577|5.0|Great story line.  Very surprised at the ending.  It was a page turner  Our book club also liked it alot.  Good discussions
B00B8PMWJI|1.0|I love the hole horror/blood & guts films. But this is just a collection of untalented people calling themselves filmmakers. Somethings are just not meant to be filmed. Ripping the head of a baby, Asian girls passing an exaggerated amount of gas in each other's faces, the rape of a little boy while to guys masturbate. I don't know how this was allowed to be made. It was not what I was expecting. This film has no plot, no story line, It was a good idea for a film destroyed by what was done to it. ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS FILM SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH OR GO NEAR A FILM CAMERA, CAMCORDER, OR ANY RECORDING DEVICE. HORROR FILMS HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE AS DARK AND SCARY AS POSSIBLE. BUT THIS FILM TAKES A HOLE DIFFERENT TURN. THERE IS JUST NO EXCUSE FOR THIS FILM TO EVEN EXIST.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|It doesn't get any better than an underplayed cop drama and Columbo really provides that type of series for us
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I have fallen from my path. I needed to read this book right now. It is basically how to walk thought life with grace. I ordered his workbook. I need help to stay on my path.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|It should have gotten best picture instead of 'The Godfather'. Everything is absolutely superb, great choreagraphy, great music and wonderful performances by all.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Old version was more pleasing to the eye. I liked layout much better. I looked forward to reveiwing weather. I am searching for another weather app.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|Wanted something to throw in the backpack for hiking trips.  I needed something that was small, lightweight, and versatile.  This sharpener fit the bill nicely and I am happy to report it does its job fine.  It isn't giving me surgically sharp blades but it will keep a knife useful in the wilderness.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|You know I have heard a lot of praise for Amazom and it's app's  I'd like to know what product the apps were  used with { only kindel } . Because I've had nothing but problems when it comes to using amazon apps for Android. Ready to give up not to bother with Amazon and it's Apps
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Last night I got dis and I played all night. It is f:$:$8ing AWESOME.<br />Couldn't put my kindle down til I passed out
B005R32L66|1.0|Another app I can not find. Looked in cloud it was not there as well. Can the app download be resent?
B000LPS4BQ|4.0|I don't know why I buy silly movies like this from time to time, but I like the lunacy of [[ASIN:B000LPS4BQ Scooby-Doo [Blu-ray]]] film.<br /><br />I'm a Buffy fan, so I had to see how Sarah Michelle Gellar handled the silliness. Professionally. Ditto Linda Cardellini, who had a tougher role: a beautiful woman playing an introverted nerd.<br /><br />Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard, well, I hate them both. One is a doofus, the other a ham.<br /><br />You decide.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|So much for having the app of which I can not find it or even down lod it again. Please resend the down  load again.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|The album does not disappoint.  Since downloading it, I have played it for 2 hours a day for the past several days.  It is a great sound track for when I am on the treadmill.  A recommended must have in your collection,
B0071XO8RA|5.0|BUY this book. It is unlike anything you have ever read. You will find it hard to put it down. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a great story. Gotta go. Have to search for more Howey books!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|If you love Nicholas Sparks and novels written so they make great movies on Lifetime, this is the book for you.  It is a nice romance, has an intriguing plot that takes some thinking to figure out, and pleases the reader seeking a sweet escape from real life problems.  Enjoy.  I personally like a much more challenging story with more gritty characters, more social issues, and less schmaltz.
0425263916|5.0|I have only gotten about 7 chapters in so far and I am hooked. This gives Fifty Shades of Grey a run for their money and I can't wait to keep reading on to see what is all going to happen!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I learned my granddaughter was reading this book voraciously and was into the whole series, I wanted to find out just what was going on.  I began with Hunger games and could not stop until I had read all of the books in the series.  Having taught Brave New World and 1984, having also taught &#34;The Lottery,&#34; I was certainly aware of the genre into which this new series fits.  Appalled by the concept of violence here, I nonetheless place this book in the group of these 3 stories as well as Handmaid's Tale.  It is good for us to consider the world we are shaping -- our next generations deserve our attention to what we allow society to become.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a horse lover and when I first saw this game for free I got it right away. This game is very educational for kids. You feed, groom, clean,treat, and enter your horse in competitions. The vision is great also. If you opt your kids want a new app to play,get this game.
B00785P2QC|3.0|took a while to figure it all out, even with prompts. once I did tho it's fun. have to type at least 13 words
B000X2H8G4|5.0|Bought one of these years ago form a magazine. &#34;Things that you never knew existed&#34;. It is awesome! It is pretty much worn out now but I love it! I did not know where to find another until I discovered Amazon. Com. They hooked me up with a supplier that had them. I bought two of them.  Happy Happy Happy.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|The new Gatsby has an ear-splitting rap and hip hop sound track--awful. This one used the music of the period. Somehow Mia Farrow was wrong as Daisy, a few years too old for the part.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book!!!as of right now this is one of my favorites. It is a story that could happen to all of us, and maybe we'll be just like Pat.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Draft Punk brought back the funk! The long wait was well worth it. They kept the essence of the 70s with their Parisian twist.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Love this book!  I hate to put it down to go to sleep!  I've read past midnight for several nights, and can't wait to read more tonight!
0802473156|4.0|This is a great book about how to get familiar about being in relationships...<br />Many people would gain from an understanding of what it means to be<br />loving...
B00C061I3K|3.0|i have always dug some of there older stuff  and i was  looking forward to this project since it has a old school feel  and some of the names on here  give it a throwback feel,  grooves have some moments however  its not really songs and alot of the time some cool ideas and jams passed off as  full fledged out songs.  i can groove  to it,however had this truly been the past meets  the future and a snap of the modern in  between then this would have been a must have. still its cool.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is time-consuming and addictive.  Lots of fun, though, but be careful not to get so hooked on playing that you forget to do all the rest of the things you need to do!
B00C2VGAW2|2.0|straight up i liked  the crazy in love remake and as a matter of fact the music for it  nicely ties the past to the present, however this  soundtracks does not fit this  film whatsoever. i mean the film back in the 70's was  boring and this film  feels over bloated we shall see.  i didn't care at all for beyonce and andre 3000  covering Amy Winehouse.  this sound track feels and sounds like any and everything thrown together  and it doesn't fit the parts to equal a sum.  i still dig the book though
B001RHPJBU|5.0|What can I say - Phil Collins - hits.  Brings back terrific memories of the 80's and early 90's.  Talented musician, wish he would come out with something new.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it! Absolutely loved this triology and the ending! High recommend this to anyone. Will probably read all 3 again at some point.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Every track delivers!  Mumford and Sons will be a tour de force for years to come!  The rythym section is pulse pounding and consistently good!  Excellent vocals and lyrics!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Fun game for my daughter to play. Nice graphics and animation. Typical downside of these types of games is having to spend actual money if you want to advance quickly. But hey the game itself is free.
B00A6VAW9W|3.0|I had high hopes for this CD because I expected that maybe Loggins had finally returned to his country rock roots of the 70's.  But it's more pop than I'd prefer with some pretty weak material and the other two band members just aren't all that strong vocally.  I understand they're song writers.  I'd suggest they stick with that.
B008Q08EV8|1.0|Sat down as a family to watch this one.  Couldn't take more than 15 minutes of it.  We all agreed to find something else.
B000SO7OL6|4.0|What could I possibly say about Diana Krall that hasn't already been said again and again.  This is a great taste of what she's all about.
B002NN5F7A|3.0|Just kinda weak storyline.  Loved the individual performances but the story was just lacking.  At least in my opinion it was.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great for organizing all your different files. I use it on my kindle fire HD. Works great and comes in handy to keep all your information in one place that you can access. Never locks up, and is there when I need it. Highly recommend.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|A page turner, beautifully written. I recommend this to all my friends.<br />It is not for the faint of heart.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Just a super fun game to play any time. I can get lost with this game for hours. Highly recommend. You won't be sorry when you down load this game and start having fun playing it!!
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a fun, page turner. Couldn't put it down from the first page to the last. Enjoyable, pleasant and all around fun love story.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I had to delete it. Found a different app that was more to my liking. Also gave me more information, a lot more!! It is the Weather Bug I really like. Sorry I couldn't say more.
B000063DGC|5.0|Great selection of songs that are live in concert.<br />This CD is great to listen to.<br />Randy on this Cd is amazing<br />You must have it in your collection<br />RIP Randy
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can't say I'm particularly thrilled with the Facebook app, especially now that scrolling through ads is such a big part of it. I'm not getting posts from the pages that I like either. I do think there's an over-emphasis on pictures and ads now.
B00005JGAF|5.0|I like Cd's or records better<br />I hate MP3 Mixes<br />I love the Ramones in Stereo and this a great cd to play loud
B008XG1X18|4.0|I think Pinterest is one of those things that might just not work as a mobile app. The whole benefit if the site is being able to see all of the pictures, but on a smaller screen it just doesn't work as well. What I do like is the ability to pin things on my Fire, so usually I end up pinning them one place and checking things out on the computer. Not bad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a really awesome game. Whenever I'm on the train or bus I seem to always find myself playing it its so addicting as well. This game should be rated number 1 because both children and adults enjoy this game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The detail and grandeur of this series is outstanding. One can see into the life of a great manor; the servants' hall, the maids at work; the kitchen chatter---but one also sees the family who lives there, whose fortune gives employment to all their staff. The events of that time in history are also wonderfully displayed. And I simply love Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|the game was fun and still is but when i play mult. every time some1 joins my lobby it kicks me from the game.  plz fix!
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|I love history, especially the early Viking invasions of the British isles,therefore I find this series quite interesting. The glimpses of how people lived during that time in history are fascinating. I look forward to more.
1416905014|2.0|The book was great and the child loved it.  The time it took to get it processed and shipped was excessively long.  I will not be ordering any further products.  I ordered it on the 4th and it was not delivered until the 18th.  The second book ordered the same time still has not shipped.  I guess they had to grow the trees before making the book.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I bought this for a friend who is ill and housebound. He was not able to see the movie at a theater so I surprised him with the DVD. He said it was FANTASTIC! He was very pleased and so am I.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I found this book dark and depressing.<br />I had heard how great her Harry Potter books were and my book club suggested this book. I found that it never seemed to be focused and it was sad, depressing. In fact I could not continue reading it. It seemed there was not one happy family in that whole depressing book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great app because it tells you what percent the weather and it helps alot cause it  tells you what cloths to wear Get it!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|2.0|unable to join minecraft Pe.  ipad os6 is unable to join with the kindle fire my y children were able to join before the ios update and now the 6.99 I paid for the app isn't worth it please resolve
B005PWPUW6|4.0|Our new TV had a digital fibrotic output and our sound 'system' was RCA with a fairly new sound bar and a subwoofer for a 15X12 foot room. The system is not audiophile (that's downstairs), but decent and sounds great with monster cable splitters off of this converter.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Cant miss if she's happy! I accidentally erased a few episodes of this season....so this was a good peace offering.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was one of the best games I have played on my kindle fire.  Can't wait for the next one!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This was an ok book. I read this before reading the book and was looking forward to watching the movie only to get something different. Really cannot compare the two. As a whole the book is alright. I enjoyed it and it had some pretty funny parts. One I might read again...years down the road but not anytime soon.
1623420148|5.0|Amazing book, amazing writing. Two things I have difficulty believing, that Emma Chase is a woman and this is her first book. Congratulations Ms. Chase and looking forward to your future books. I can only imagine how wonderful they are going to be.
6300271439|5.0|Movie arrived when promised, and in good codition. I liked it when I first saw it years ago, but had gotten the title mixed up with another. I've relaxed with it at least 5 times so far, lol. Thank you.<br /><br />D.Moses
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Its a well made card game.The best part of it is they are always adding new cards .The game is always getting more updates.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If there was any book u could read and never put down it would b we this one. It is an amazingly attention drawing book. Oh my HEAVENS is putting it lightly. You must read it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So happy to have found Seasons 2-4 on Amazon Streaming!  I was pleasantly surprised to learn Amazon Streaming was free for Amazon Prime members!
B00C0W08XK|5.0|The very first time I attempted to play this year's ago I tried on the 'difficult' level but didn't know it.  Of course I couldn't solve it and put it down in frustration!  This particular game makes it easy to understand and I am enjoying now!
0345529057|5.0|product was received quickly and undamaged. Love the books! I made the mistake of watching the tv series first but the books add a lot more detail and are worth reading!
B008ALA6DW|3.0|I like Apple products.  I love thunderbolt.  It is insanely fast and full of awesome.  The problem is every little adapter is $20-$30.  Honestly, if you tear that thing apart 99% is just wiring.  I love the technology I just hate feeling like I'm paying 500%-1000% markups until the generic peripheral companies catch up.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is truly a captivating read. Many times I wanted to put the book down and take a break from the sadness and hurt the characters dealt with page after page, but the beauty of the narrative kept me going. Just heartbreaking....
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This series is really good. Expect the unexpected because there are things in here that shocked me. I really enjoyed not just this book but the series. Currently waiting on book #6.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|These stories were lackluster and meaningless.  There is no reason for the audience to care about any of the outcomes or what ties them together.  The kid from 21 is a terrible actor.  Halle Berry is minimally better.  Hanks should have turned down this mess.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|GREAT and touching movie that I am thrilled to own so I can watch it over and over again,  Totally enjoyable..
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|this was advertised as an adventure fast-paced movie when in fact it was a story about the pilot's realization that he was a pathetic alcoholic and drug addicted loser. Denzel performed well, but it was slow moving
B00C061I3K|5.0|I love Daft Punk and especially loved Discovery above all other albums they produced...but by no means do the other albums have any less merit.  This one ties in second with the Human After All album. Any true Daft fan will recognize  how certain tracks sound like they exude the character of previous albums. It's a really great CD and had a bunch of collaborative artists. Phenomenal.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|An excellent recap of all the things you didn't know about America.  The book is not always balanced in its presentation of facts, but for partisans, it is invaluable.  Who knew the United States had a massive stockpile of poisonous gas that it was itching to use, but WWI ended too soon?  Horrifying facts like this and the accounting of American businessmen, including George W. Bush's grandpa, who did business with Adolf Hitler, really gives lie to the notion of &#34;American exceptionalism&#34;.
B003UESJHO|5.0|DVD and box nothing special but with a film like this it doesn't matter. Both actors deserved an Oscar. Amy Adams great too. Moving film.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Very inspirational, great story, and a quick read! The stories draw you in and it's hard to put down the book.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|My Mom loves her voice but I knew she would mainly want the hits. She blasts this in the car.
B002M5E2DW|2.0|Not that it was written bad or anything like that, just not what I was expecting. I think I will just read the Bible.
B003ZJ0ZX0|3.0|Considering the hype on this album I thought it would be better. Hard to rate a CD since music is do objective, but I re-sold it immediately.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|anti-virus always gives me a feeling of security. and avast is definitely one of the best free ones out there.<br />a website i like is AV-Comparatives.org there you can see how some of the best antiviruses stack up.<br />and then you can make an informed decision whether you want avast or something else<br />I don't know of anyone that compares mobile versions, if you do feel free to respond to this with a site you know
B0012DP8A6|5.0|So glad I was able to buy it and so quickly. This is a classic for anyone that hasn't seen it. Acting, music all awesome. Steve Martin steals the show.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is acute game with all the Nemo characters available and some neat ones that come along and stay. Colorful and bright
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Nice packaging. Great film as we all know. Lots of extras - though I haven't gotten around to watching them yet!
B009VB9VKY|5.0|The movie it self and story line suck but who cares when you have sexy male strippers!!! A must watch!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The place for all three was awesome. You can't go wrong with these films as we all know. Worth watching again and again.
1616550414|5.0|It's hard back with info on every zelda game made and it has a bonus manga shows 4 different categories (not counting manga) on zelda games art,characters,timeline and about different games
1931955085|5.0|Illustrations are beautiful and inspiring. The quality of the pages is excellent, thick and glossy. The hard back book is great to display.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|What can I say ... It's the Weather Chanel.  You can enter your city or town and it will give you total information for only your area.  Course, you can check another area also, but  I like it because I don't have to go to the big city area to guess round abouts what I will experience.  I have both the Weather Chanel and Radar Express - NOAA Weather app on my Kindle Fire.  I can take the weather with me.  Both are really great to download ... And also .. It's free ...
B001UV4XIS|5.0|All you HP fans know how great it is. Just wanted to give 5 stars. Also, packing is fine and as described. No issues.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The first chapters dragged on a bit but once I got to the middle I was hooked, I'd fall asleep trying to finish the book each night
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Ryan Renolds, Jason Bateman, Leslie Mann, and Olivia Wilde are all excellent in this. It makes fun of itself for having a n unoriginal story line. Good for a lot of laughs at real life and for ridiculousness. Worth the few bucks!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love it and will use it daily and thank you for letting me get it for free. Angela Thompson
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This doctor's experience is easy and fascinating to read. Whether you believe or not, his story is really interesting and his arguments comforting. Thought provoking and quick read.  I hope it's all true!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is not for the faint hearted, it is explicit and for mature audiences. So if you are looking for a naughty way to pass some time, I highly recommend the entire series!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Then you'll love this. Great acting. Wish it went on this way for the continuing seasons. Very unexpected, complicated and original. Have you on the edge of your seat.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Everyone  should get temple run because it is a class game. I love it is so cool. If you can get temple run get it you will love it.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|This is a remake of a foreign film and man do they do it justice. I wish this movie had been seen by more people. I keep telling friends to watch it. The performances are excellent and it really has original elements. A must see for horror fans!
B003QP4NPE|5.0|It is rich with tech and a story that I had no idea where it was going. I realized about 1/3 of the way through that it reminds me of the experience of reading early Clancy novels. I recommend it for any computer geek or techies. Brilliant realization of the possibilities.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|As usual with HBO the packaging quality and images are excellent. They are always made well and for fans - and are pricey. The show is entertaining but I didn't get hooked like many people say they did. Prefer Boardwalk Empire on HBO or GRIMM for a similar vibe.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|The three books follow the iife of Harry Clifton from childhood to adulthood.  With so many twist and stories within stories, I couldn't put it down.  Had to wait to get the third book, so I could continue reading.  Sorry to see it end.  One of Jeffrey Archer's best, although I haven't read an Archer book I didn't like.
B002ZE85YW|5.0|Not exactly the greatest movie of all time, but really fun and entertaining - which is all you want out of these movies. Christian Bale is awesome as usual.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|This third volume of Jeffrey Archer's Clifton Chronicles is, in a word, childish.  Not only was it sloppily edited but Archer again dropped his audience in the middle of the story, meaning, I suppose, there is another volume intended, but not yet announced.  I certainly hope not.  This is not up to Archer's standard at all.  The plot is far too simple and he used a partial plot from an earlier work again by involving an Argentina bad actor into the story.  Perhaps he intended this for a elementary school child to read.  I will not be reading any follow-on parts of the Clifton Chronicle.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|The show as any fan knows is incredible. HBO always has quality packaging and cases that last. The print quality is good and the boxes are sturdy. Images vivid. Good price!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Like being able to check in on my Kindle for weather updates  Saves my going back and forth to computer.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|As expected. Disney charm and personality. Great characters. A lot of fun. DVD quality is fine. Looking forward to sequel.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I feel I have lived the lives of these women.  My heart is breaking and at the same time uplifted .
B005GVA2L0|3.0|I guess Amy Lee wanted to do something different, which I get. But I prefer the other albums. I like her operatic singing. Too bad the original members didn't stick together!
1439102813|3.0|It was listed as new but someones name was on the inside cover!<br />I would call this used not new.
B00CRW2066|5.0|High Violet was an amazing album.  Have been waiting for follow up to see where they would (or even could) go from there.  So far so good...my initial reaction is oh, hell to the yeah!
B00095NX9G|5.0|It is working properly and I'm still using it every day and I'm taking basic classes to practice even more.
B005HSL626|5.0|This was one of the first games I downloaded onto my Kindle. I've had this game for months, but I still like to play and I'm not bored with it yet. I'd recommend this to anyone who has decent reflexes and time to kill.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I love these movies, awesome story-great deal, two in one double feature, you must watch these two movies, they are great!!
B003TML0VO|3.0|CD was not in wrap - probably opened and copied!  Unable to give as gift as intended.  Not happy, and seller never contacted me back!  Don't use them , don't know what you'll get.
B004SBX112|5.0|I brought this to put on my phone so that when I'm with my grand daughter and she gets fussy she can play it, but I love it too.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This is a very funny book. All the characters are endearing. Even the villains. Jonasson's writing style is easy and very humorous . It almost has a slap stick quality to it. So if you are looking for a gutsy serious book perhaps this is not the one for you. Having said this the writer does take us on a whirl wind historical/ political journey but cleverly interweaves the main character Allan into it. Very clever.<br />I really enjoyed this book
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love the way you have new missions to accomplish. Always something to do to keep you busy. Love this game!
B004V9MU86|5.0|Im really enjoying this book, and cant put it down. Im only half way through it, but finding it a good read for many ages.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I did not know what to think of this film before watching. It just seemed like a strange concept for a movie. I found it worked and was enjoyable. I do tend to rate items/films higher than some unless I was really disappointed.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|It was for my husband's headset, the charger that came with it didn't have a long cord, so we looked on line and found this, he liked it because he had tried out a motorola headset that came with a charge case and he liked that; we couldn't understand him talking on that headset so we went back and got the voyager headset.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|If you dig middle earth, I doubt you will hate this movie. That being said it is not the best work, but still for a fantasy freak like myself I was able to enjoy it. In hindsight, I would have rather waited a few years and just watched the marathon when the story is complete.
B007JMW46U|5.0|This was a great book. The Sherlock Holmes stories are very  close to my heart and the illustrations were very nice too.
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|Cloud Atlas was very different and one that was not watched from beginning, was lost from the start with a ?????????? in my eyes for the rest?
B00CH87HF4|4.0|fun way to kill the time and some demons!!! just started playing and for a free game you cant beat the action and graphics.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|Beautiful Creatures was a very good movie. I liked the twist in the story lines , with the great new faces in the led.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Kept my attention from start to finish. Good read, not to smutty.didn't seem believable to me on getting married on the first time meeting.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book is great! very informational; it goes into the science of how food works in your body and why we eat certain things.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I used to hate MINECRAFT because  my brother played but I bought it and it is the best app ever  I have no clue why you would not buy it its well worth the money.
B003ZFCBJ0|4.0|Love getting movies from amazon because I know the quality is always going to be great. Movie started off slow, but tugged at my heart by the end.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the most AWESOME APP ever  because the graphics  are AWESOME ..........<br />It is a very  fun app and well worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game. kids of all ages can do. fun for entire family. game never ends so always task to do to take care of your horses.
6305609705|5.0|I had never seen this movie before so seeing it was like going to a theater , i loved it !  Mindblowing
B00006EXDM|5.0|Rolling Stones.  The greatest all time rock n roll group of all time.<br /><br />Even though it took a long time for me to recieve the CD.  (I shipped it to a South American address)  I couldn't wait to put this in the player and crank it up.  Worth the wait.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Although i did not read the book I did enjoy the move as an action junkie.  It was too easy to predict what was going to happen.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Nice transaction! Arrived on time and as advertised. This version is the best! Much truer to Fitzgerald than the 2013 version. Hip-Hop in 1922....Really? Try this one!!!
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Well done! Nice transaction. On time and as advertised. Love this series. Don't miss an episode. It's all good. Try it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book a couple of months ago and it has stuck with me. HOPELESS is one of those books that I would recommend to everyone, and I do.  I feel in love with the story. I feel in love with the characters. I felt like I was lost when the story ended because I became so emotionally attached to the characters. I can not say enough GOOD THINGS about this novel. Colleen Hoover did a phenomenal job. If you have NOT read this book -- buy it now. Read it now.  You will NOT be disappointed.  There is no way I could tell you one thing about this book because I would not want to give one bit away, just trust that this is by far one of the best reads you'll find out there right now.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is epic, it's almost as good as the pc or Xbox versions. The only thing I wish it had was red stone because I love red stone circuts. I would suggest this game.e to anyone who has ever heard about or played minecraft.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I just got a kindle and was having a hard time finding a game to hold my attention-- and then I stumbled across this. At first I thought it might be too slow moving, but quite to the contrary, you really get pulled into finding the clues and watching the storyline unfold. Love it!
B00CW665VI|4.0|It's interesting to have such a lol mans perspective, this was very different...but in saying that its so well written its a blast! It's a fabulous story with wonderful characters. Well worth the read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. And best of all, it's free! It runs smooth and haven't had any trouble with it.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This is a curious book. And so I read. The book is written in the first person by a boy with autism. When the neighbor's dog is \\"murdered\\" Christopher makes it his mission to discover who committed the crime. As he goes about the neighborhood working as a detective, it becomes obvious to the reader that Christopher has autism. Math is the simplest thing in the world, whereas the smallest emotions are too complex to understand. Sensitive readers should know that the book contains a lot of profanity. Interestingly enough, Christopher never picks up on profane language. He never mimics the language he hears on a regular basis. This is probably my only critique of the author's writing style, which I found fascinating.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am wondering if the HBO True Blood has ruined the original fun upbeat writings by Charlaine Harris.  I was so excited to begin reading this book and it took everything to remain engaged with the storyline.  The writing in this book felt so different than all of the previous books, it made me wonder if someone else wrote it.  It did not contain the dingy, fun loving Sookie that we have all come to love and cheer for; this Sookie was pathetic and boring.  I am so bummed with where this series has taken us.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great book, was about an hour and a half read. The author used flawless comparisons and gave a lot of great information about the story of Nikola tesla (although I wish he had gone further in depth with some of the topics) while also expressing how imagination (along with other things) is one of the keys to success. All in all a good read!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|One of the best games I have played... The best one gameloft has made yet... I love it... Good game...
1623420148|5.0|Ok I've never written a review before but.... wow! I really enjoyed this book. Reading the entire thing from a mans POV was the catcher for me. I found myself laughing out loud so many times... my husband, son and even my dog looked at me like I had 3 heads because I'm laughing at my kindle...oh well it was worth it! Can't wait to read more from Emma Chase.... keep writing some good stuff for us!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Exciting and suspenseful but very sad it is by far one of the best books I have read! I highly recommend reading this book.
0062082353|5.0|The best of all 3 sniper books that I have read. Not only did Chris Kyle nail the life of a sniper in and off the field of battle, he redefined what being a sniper in the USMC should be to every inspired soldier. A Stupendous read!
B006W5JF9Y|5.0|The headline says it all. Great music, great cause great price, 4 albums for this price with many modern bands doing cover can't beat it.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Bought this as a gift, the quality is good and it fits the Fire nicely.  I would buy it again.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I can't remember why I loaded this, except I think I was trying to download something to my kindle fire and it epically failed. I recently began receiving ebooks from my online college course, from Smartcourse and this is a required app. I was sure glad I had it because I still struggle to use my kindle to its fullest as well, probably because I'm a muddle through it kinda gal and not necessarily a read every word of the manual gal! There have been several other downloads that were made easy or possible because I had this program. Kinda runs itself when you are downloading, which is nice. Generally I give it thumbs up!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I downloaded this on a whim and I'm very pleased that I did. I've already spent hours engrossed in this game and look forward to new releases from this group.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|It Is a great game but the one flaw,is that it takes over and won't let you make moves you want to make. It requires that you make the suggested moves first even if you see a better one. I enjoy it but it does get frustrating at times.
1589944607|5.0|This is a great strategy and action game that is highly thematic. Essentially this is a cooperative game where the players are supposed to be working together, except that at least one player will end up being a traitor and nobody knows if it will be when the game starts or if it will come halfway through the game. The traitor tries not to be detected while subtly sabotaging the efforts of the human players to win the game. If the Cylon gets discovered then they can be even more deadly be directly throwing obstacles into the path of the human players who are trying to survive. There is a lot of tension as accusations fly and bids for power are made between the Admiral, President, and other characters in the game. What happens if the President or Admiral are secretly Cylons? What if they are both Cylons? Run through this game to find out for yourself. Every play feels like an episode of this great sci-fi adventure.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|this game was not as long as some.  seemed fairly easy and not very involved.  this game is only free for the first of five chapters.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|Cohen has a knack for knowing how to lampoon himself and just about everyone else. This was a highly enjoyable movie.
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|Extremely powerful movie. Especially if you're into free will and determinism. Takes you on a down and up not up and down ride. To me it was a thinking man's/woman's movie.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I get a bunch of compliments on this! It is a great product! Will definitely get again, and again! Thanks
0307887960|4.0|SUPER PLAN! Sound advice and good way of eating to keep you healthy and give you<br />great guidelines to live by!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Fast paced with good vacation. A page turner. Balsamic is as good as anyone. I read \\"The Hit\\" first and it was a bit of a letdown but I really liked this one.
B009X01C64|5.0|I bought this for my sons kindle fire and it is a wonderful product. It protects the screen and acts as a stand (horizontal or vertical) There is a magnet inside the case that activates the on off switch on my Kindle Fire 8.9 HD.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|To me, a good movie soundtrack allows me to re-live the movie in my mind and yet, also allows me to experience the music as it stands. This soundtrack does both. I love it. I'm hesitant to say that I like the Star Trek Into Darkness soundtrack *better* than the 2009 Star Trek soundtrack, but it's at least *as* good at that one. I don't really know much about musical parlance (tone, pitch, melody, cues, themes, etc.), but I can say with absolute certainty that this made me cry as much as the last soundtrack and made me as happy as that one too.<br /><br />The first track \\"Logos/Pranking the Natives\\" is as beautiful as the first track or two on the 2009 soundtrack, and is similar in structure, yet different in a very interesting way. Just like the movies are similar, yet different (same crew, ship, Universe, etc.), this soundtrack reminds me of the last one, but--dare I say--improves on it? There are similarities and differences (most notably the drastically different track #5, \\"The Kronos Wartet\\", with the Klingon voices), as there should be in the soundtracks for a canonical Universe. And yet it's beautiful on its own as a work of classical music.<br /><br />Yes, I'm a trekkie or a trekker or whatever you wish to call me (I watch at least one episode of one of the series--TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT--every day), but I don't believe being a fan is a prerequisite for totally falling in love with this soundtrack. I listened to it the whole way through the moment I received it, and it was a glorious experience. Powerful, beautiful, and emotional.<br /><br />My only unfulfilled wish is that there could have been more to the CD liner notes, more photos and stuff, but that's not why I bought this. I bought it for the musical genius of Michael Giacchino.
0553801473|3.0|The book was slow-moving with no real plot.  The chapters after Daenerys were some of the most boring I have ever read.  This was clearly written as a \\"Tweener\\" novel, with the sole purpose of selling a fifth book to make a sixth.<br /><br />This review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NMQV4ZDQ47D7/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3NMQV4ZDQ47D7<br /><br />Is 100% accurate.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game... it is so addicting but I think Mojang should put a free Minecraft-Pocket Edition that you can actually save your world on it. (For kindle fire)
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The DVD was as advertised.  It was like new and performed as a new one would.  I had no problems with it.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Very good book had trouble putting it down. I thought the ending was alright. I also liked how the book not only told about Lena's life but Hana's life.
034580404X|1.0|These books are the worst!  Only dimwitted lonely housewives could possibly fall for this nonsense.  The main characters are the most annoying humans beings that have ever been featured in print.<br /><br />Ignore all of the hype.  Don't waste your time!
B003GSLX5Y|2.0|Though the content of the book is important for everyone, this issue has some editing issues that make it difficult to read and to follow. My advice is to look for a different version.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|EXCELLENT READ!! I was so caught up in the characters that I literally found myself trying to take deeper breaths of air. I hope to be able to read more about Juliette and Lukas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun game. You have a lot of fun trying to beat your high score and run away from the cops.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|My brother in law recommended the first Sherlock Homes movie to me and I finally purchased it at a local pawn shop. I really enjoyed it so much that I wanted to see the sequel. I found it on line and was not at all disappointed. A lot of sequels fall short of the first movie but this one delivers. This movie shipped on time and in good condition.
6305882592|5.0|I saw Harold and Maude many years ago and remembered it to be a good film. Now that I've seen it again, I see that unlike others, it has stood the test of time and is better than I remembered. It's a great, quirky film.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a remarkable novel, peopled with real, flawed and lovable characters. The author artfully blended past events with present to bring the story to its satisfying conclusion. More, please, Ms. McKenna!
0812982622|2.0|Being a Pulitzer Prize winning book, I hoped for a great read, but was very disappointed. While the book is somewhat revealing of the kind of oppression and mental and physical confinement experience by North Koreans, the story is very thin and depressing. It's also somewhat confusing as it talks about the main character taking the place of and becoming someone else, who is a nationally know personality. Very odd.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is a great app for writing yourself reminders or just little notes on  things you observe.Kind of like writing mini notes to yourself. Its fun and easy. You can attach pictures or audio clips. Get it now!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Card must have such compassion and wisdom himself to describe wisdom so beautifully in a story! Quite a lot of psychology, but to me it gives the story more depth. The writing tone and the story itself are very different compared to Ender's Game, yet the author succeeds to equally strongly transport you into a new world and reality. Was reading this over a few days because of very hectic work commitments, but had trouble feeling connected to anything I had to do, and was desperate to go back to the book's reality.  Will order the next book ASAP.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was challenging but fun! I highly recommend this game. The only one who has been the most important
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It's a good clock I like it's features but it always has room to improve but it's one of the best looking ones I've seen
0307476073|5.0|I am not particularly good at writing book reviews.  Will just say that it's yet another book, or journal, or memoirs of such that I could not put it down.  Strayed keeps you so close that you can feel the trail under your feet and the thirst when her water supply runs out on the hottest parts of the trails.  Highs and lows.  Made me wish I was in shape and young enough to tackle such an adventure just like Cheryl did in her book.  Terrific read. I loved it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is so good.  Do yourself a favor and read it. I really think more romances should be written in the H's POV.<br /><br />Drew Evans is a playboy. He's rich, gorgeous, successful and the King of One-Night Stands. Finally, he finds a woman who makes him see the light and he falls hard and falls fast for Kate Brooks. They become coworkers, rivals, frenemies and eventual friends. Their rivalry is an absolute riot. Kate and her long-time boyfriend call it quits and Drew sees his chance. They have an amazing weekend together but unfortunately, he makes a colossal, stupid mistake because well, he's got a huge ego to protect and God forbid he puts himself out there and expresses his true feelings and so he loses her. This is the story about how he gets the \\"flu\\" (lol) and all the hoops he has to jump through including adorable romantic gestures in order to get her back.<br /><br /> I loved this book. This guy's inner thoughts, feelings and just whatever came out of his mouth was hilarious and absolutely priceless. I have not had this much fun reading a romance in a while. This book is utterly charming and I highly recommend it to all lovers of contemporary romance.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|The movie itself, is super cute. I bought this for a family that is going out of town so they can download the digital version for the kids computers as well.<br /><br />I would recommend.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Does what I need it to do on my android device. I can edit documents on the go even. Great app.
1620647133|2.0|I have listened to every Bill Bryson book I can find on audio. And thoroughly enjoyed them all. Until now. Other than &#34; A Brief History...&#34; (which was great BTW) this is the first one I listened to he did not narrate himself. This narrator simply did not tell a story the way Bryson does and I don't know if it was just that or if this book just isn't as good as other Bryson books but I did not enjoy this one. I would really like to see this re-released with Bryson as the narrator.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Great voice, I like her, she does not distract from her great talent with little to no clothes. Very classy young lady. Her music is thought provoking and inspiring to listen to. She reminds me of a slightly less powerful Adele (whose music I love) but the same pureness and intensity.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love, love, love this series!!!!  I was a johny come lately and didn't join the original bandwagon for this series so I had to catch up and oh my, I am now hocked.  Can't wait for season 4!!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is so good I wanted to read it before I watched movie although I started very late and I was not disappointed and hoping won't be by the movie either! If you haven't read this book do you will enjoy it and need to finish the series!

B00BURWSG6|5.0|Timo Tolkki has created a brand new project with Avalon, and it is down right brilliant! The songs run from powerful riffing monsters to beautiful ballads - everything you would expect in a \\"metal opera\\" concept album. The guests are top notch vocalists and musicians from around the globe, most notably, Russell Allen, Michael Kiske and Rob Rock on vocals, and Alex Holzworth behind the drum kit. The majority of the vocals are from Elize Ryd of Amaranthe, who is phenomenal throughout. The guest list does not stop there, with a literal who's who of keyboard players on board as well.<br />Overall, a solid and well balanced album that fits right into the power metal genre, somewhere between Stratovarius and Avantasia. The first review by \\"John\\" gives this only 3 stars, yet calls most of the album \\"great\\" or better with excellent and emotional vocal performances.<br />Seems like \\"John's\\" stars were not aligned properly when he wrote his review - this is 5 star material and a fantastic return to form by Timo Tolkki in part 1 of a 3 part trilogy known as Avalon! Can't wait for the next two installments! 5 stars all the way, and welcome back Timo!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I have to be honest, I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie, but it was actually very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something light and funny.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|Sequels, sequels, sequels.  What to do with them?  You wish to remain true to the original incarnation, yet you must add elements that are new.  \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" presents all of these issues on steroids, including Michael Giacchino's score.  First of all this is a good film; it is fun, exciting, and it has moving moments.  But it could have been a great film.  Consider, J.J. Abrams chose to resurrect Khan Noonien Singh, easily the single most iconic adversary in Star Trek lore, and you have a great actor play the part, Benedict Cumberbatch really did a fine job, and then you more or less marginalize him with a secondary plot involving an admiral who wants to militarize Star Fleet (a secret \\"dreadnaught\\" class starship, really?) and send it into war after war.  There is little background on Khan or the Eugenics Wars which would have added some character development and maybe the chance for some social commentary (remember, that is very much what Gene Roddenberry was all about) which could have been the basis of a far more engaging plot.  Well, you could have had so much more fun with Khan, his 72 \\"friends\\", and a simplified plot.  Still, the most important parts of Star Trek are the main characters and the interplay among them, and that works just fine here, and the introduction of Carol Marcus has interesting possibilities but is largely undeveloped here.  It is a visually stunning movie and it is fun and exciting.  Now as to the music which generally is also fun and exciting. Michael Giacchino provides what was needed and his score works very well on screen.  He makes good use of the main theme from the earlier film and actually does quite a bit with it and that is all good.  But here again there are missed opportunities.  Again, you have resurrected Khan!  This should have warranted a major and memorable theme, a counterpoint to the Star Trek theme, which should have defined and driven much of this score!  The music for Khan is somewhat understated to saythe least.  On the other hand, Giacchino does some good things with the Klingons (it is not Jerry Goldsmith's Klingon introduction of course), and it works (\\"The Kronos Wartet\\"). Still, this score is more than adequate for the film and makes an adequate soundtrack album, but more could have been done here. Nicely produced by Varese with adequate (that word again) packaging.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game and it is super fun. I love how the guy is chasing u and u have to run away
B00127RAJY|4.0|Nice to have when you think you don't have time to workout. There are 3 levels of difficulty. Have not made it to level 3 yet.
0517548232|5.0|I love reading the truth. These are the basic principles and guidelines for a free-market economy and a laissez-faire Government influence. We all know liberals who want to take your money and spend it as they see fit - rather than letting people and the market decide are a bunch of commies and this shows why.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Non stop edge of your seat reading from the start. I could not put this book down!<br />I highly recommend the read!
B007SUW24W|5.0|LOVE this cd! Ed Sheeran is truly a talented artist, musician, poet... It has been in my CD player in my car sence I recieved it in the mail. Need to get the next album!
075669812X|5.0|Well, Ninjago is not something I watch or understand - but judging by the reaction my son had when I gave him this book - I assume it is popular. He absolutely loved this book and the bonus mini figure that came with it.
B00003CWPL|5.0|A gift for my son, quality of film was good, the movie itself a bit too bizarre for me, but it's not mine.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Well, this is not a game I play - but my 9 year old son loves this. He keeps telling me how great the graphics are. He spends time on this game and seems to have a lot of fun. I downloaded it for free - but I would have paid for it based on how much my son has enjoyed it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Having watch episodes of this season (Winter / Spring of 2013), I was curious on its beginnings.  I was not disappointed.  It hooked me.  I enjoyed the actors' engaging their craft.  I hope to watch the remaining first season episodes.
B000002VSN|5.0|Anything that Whitney sings is OK with me.  I enjoyed the soundtrack when I viewed the movie and that  prompted me to to buy the album.  This is the 5th. copy of the<br />album.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|love it brilliant. the dvd is awesome. just wish it had the peponi song on it as thats my favorite so was disappointed about that
B00CI1TQHM|5.0|First Devo and The Cars both came out with new music. Then Ultravox. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I found out that Visage had a new release almost ready to come out. I liked their Facebook page and listened to the preview clips. Each clip came with the story behind the song, which really added a lot. Finally, the day came, I downloaded the album, and got to hear the entire thing.<br /><br />I. Loved. It.<br /><br />I always thought their first album, Visage, was great, but lyrically was a bit childish in places. I didn't really care, I don't pay much attention to lyrics anyway, and I loved the music. Then The Anvil came out. Much more mature both lyrically and music-wise, but a little on the dark side. Later I got their Greatest Hits and heard some of the cuts from the third album, and was really glad I didn't spend any money on it.<br /><br />Hearts and Knives lightens up the music side a bit, while keeping the lyrics on the mature side. This album is everything I'd hoped it would be, and then some. It is the perfect cross between their first two albums, with a style that sounds like early '80s Visage yet isn't dated and still sounds fresh.<br /><br />If you haven't heard of Visage or Ultravox, but you liked The Human League and ABC, get this album. Then go get Visage and The Anvil. You'll be glad you did.
0800141865|5.0|I read his bio and wanted to see this movie.I. Ordered it received it immediately and totally enjoyed it. Thank you
B00BSWMITK|4.0|Joe Satriani returns full force with an exciting new album featuring some of the best backing musicians of his career who have certainly helped to make Unstoppable Momentum one of his most memorable albums of recent times. Following a few years of what many fans and critics described as treading water and a slight feeling of repeating past sounds, Joe Satriani has really taken it up a notch here by doing a few things differently. Production was handled by Mike Fraser so the sound is amazing and crisp. I have to give compliments to Satriani's decision to get a new backing band with some more intense playing especially in the drumming department which has added a lot of life and power to his creations. Drumming was handled by Vinnie Colaiuta who is one of the best in the business, Chris Chaney from Jane's Addiction handles bass with some great grooves, and Mike Keneally plays keys with his unique and well known flair. I really feel these players have contributed to the overall vibe and memorable sound of this album and helped to make Joe Satriani exciting again. Highlights include the awesome album opener \\"Unstoppable Momentum\\", the rocking jam of \\"Truth And Lies\\", the killer groove of \\"Jumpin' In\\", and the mystical and unique sounds of \\"The Weight Of The World\\" where the band really gets cracking. Joe Satriani delivers a great album with Unstoppable Momentum and hopefully this group of musicians can stay together for a tour and really stretch their wings on these high quality compositions.
B002DF1OL4|5.0|Brown, brown, brown, was the color of the mud... That didn't stop the youngsters from enjoying the festival.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film consisted of an interview with a concert goer who did not purchase a ticket to the festival. He commented that most of the people coming to the festival were looking for an answer when it was non-existent. He asserted that music alone does not attract such a large crowd of people.<br /><br />Kids these days are complaining that they were born in the wrong era. I can't blame them for that. But if you want the best seats in the house and witness the defining musical triduum, then look no further.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|Deep Purple return after a very long absence of new music with their amazing new album called Now What?! which shows why they are considered to be one of the best rock bands of all time regardless of the lineup. Produced by Bob Ezrin from Pink Floyd and Alice Cooper fame, Now What?! is an example of a band firing on all cylinders and working together creatively to produce excellent new music that respects the past while forging a fresh future. The current lineup features Ian Gillan on vocals, Roger Glover on bass, Ian Paice on drums, Steve Morse on guitar, and Don Airey on keyboards and they all perform superbly on this album to create some really exciting songs and musical passages. Highlights include the rocking opener \\"Simple Song\\", the progressive sounds of \\"Weirdestan\\", the signature rock vibe of \\"Out Of Hand\\" featuring some great keyboard sounds, the great groove and guitar playing of \\"Bodyline\\", the sweet build up and intense crescendo of \\"Uncommon Man\\", and the very smooth sound of \\"All The Time In The World\\". Besides being an amazing album of all new material that cements their relevance, Now What?! is appropriately dedicated to Deep Purple's late keyboard player and founding member Jon Lord whose influence on music continues to this day. Now What?! is highly recommended to all Deep Purple fans and anyone who likes good quality hard rock with a progressive twist - a very solid 4.5 stars.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game keeps me I entertained for hours and it is very fun<br />You have to spread a plague and spread it around the world and try to wipe out all of mankind
B005IA9JZO|5.0|I know you have read all the reviews. This is just my two cents on a fun movie.<br /><br />Yes, this NOT your vintage Peter Pan movie. That is the whole point. It was filmed to be an update. That's why the Lost Boys play basketball and ride skateboards. To me, that was a small price to pay for a fun flick. By now, you all know the premise is a grown up Peter Pan `lost' in the world of grown-ups. A-HA! See the correlation? One of Robin William's best roles (he is better in serious roles than slappy stuff...see Bicentennial Man). He has lost sight of his true self, and it takes the kidnapping of his children by Hook (Hoffman is excellent) to recapture what we all lose as we get older....the ability to let us loose our inner child.<br /><br />Spielberg makes a very obvious point in this film. If we lose the ability to enjoy our lives as children do, we become stiff, stolid, and joyless. We become destined to discuss the weather, politics, and banal crap.<br /><br />So that's all I wanted to post here. Enjoy this film, with whatever flaws it may have, as a piece filled with Spielberg magic. I know I did. nother thng to point out, this was made before CG graphics took over. So most of the film was made on real sets.<br /><br />By the way, I still wish I could fly........
B001KX50BK|4.0|One of those movies that will never get OLD. it is one of the classics form the 80's. And the soundtrack makes the movie..
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This product came in good time with great packaging and was in great condition. I got this for one of my Trekkie friends, and she absolutely loved it! I'm thinking about getting her that other one for Christmas or something :)
B00AIBZJS4|4.0|Love this DVD. I have seen Cirque Du Soleil in person and was mesmerized. expensive to go but very well worth the money. Wanted something to watch at home and this fills the need. does not give you full perspective but close on a big screen tv.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It was very useful. You could set multiple alarms, and choose a favorite song for a ring tone, etc. But, it stopped working all of a sudden. it didn't go off unless it was already opened from that point. I don't know why it works for other people!

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Everything about this mouse is excellent, especially for the price. My wireless Logitech MX-1000 started having really odd cut-out issues after a couple years of use, and not wanting to spend a billion-million dollars on a mouse (as I simply have never used a high-end mouse) I picked this one up. One gripe, sometimes the side mouse buttons (which I use for page forward/ page back) are a bit over-sensitive and tend to double-click on occasion, but this is minor.<br /><br />The software that comes with this mouse is AWESOME, with lots of great customization options and custom weighting, which is rare in mice in this price-range. The DPI buttons are customizable and easily accessible. You really can't go wrong with this mouse.

B0089LOKHG|5.0|Requiem ended pretty much how I hoped it would.<br /><br />I loved reading the story alternating between Lena and Hana's POV.<br /><br />I don't even know what to say. This book makes me want to cry because it's over. So many feels!!!<br /><br />I only wish there was an epilogue so I could know what happens next!<br /><br />Lauren Oliver is four for four on the books I've read. Amazing writer. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is awesome and reminds me so much of Myst. It makes you go and do things that you think you know is right, when in the long run you are so wrong. When the game is over you'll wish it was longer. I can't wait to see if they'll put out a Sequel. Have fun, I know I did.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This is a fast paced thriller that had me captivated from word one. Expect to be taken on a brutal journey to find the cold-blooded 'Time Waster' murderer and there are plenty of plot twists and turns to keep the reader entertained on the way. Detectives Larkin and Fairlane certainly have their work cut out for them... Can't wait for book two!

B00AQCMK32|4.0|I would have gave it 5 stars but it would errors every time I get a fan letter<br />But other than that I love it
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am not usually one to complain, but words cannot describe how disappointed I am with this novel.  After putting in several years to these novels I cannot believe that THIS is the end!  Although the action plot line was not the most riveting in the series, it was certainly decent enough.  My disappointment lies not with the action in this tale but rather with the drama and relationships.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*  Yes, I am an Eric/Sookie fan so obviously he is my first choice for her to end up with but geez louise...SAM?!?!  I mean he was constantly rebuffed by her and put into the 'friend zone' throughout all of the novels...and now when they have shared the magic of the cluviel dor, she feels attracted to him and does not question it?  Yet she questioned her blood bond with Eric in the past??  Not even going to go into how bizarre and out of left field that one is because honestly that is besides the fact.  The fact is that the Eric all of us fans know and love would have FOUND a way around the marriage contract or would have died trying.  At the VERY VERY least he would have had some sobby (sobby on my part) breakup talk with her completely explaining it all to her and not just saying \\"trust how I feel\\" and then peacing out on her at the hospital only to leave everything to be explained to her by Bill.  Ms. Harris built up the character of Eric for 9 BOOKS only to destroy him by making him so inconsequential.  Thankfully the world of fanfic has provided some much needed therapy to my frayed nerves.  If you are debating buying this book, don't - just make up your own ending in your head because I can guarantee it will be better than this novel.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it although there are some dishonest people that play be careful when trading. Also love the slots part of the game too. Worth while giving a go it's good fun.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game was epic i really liked it i think it was exactly like the movie and everyone knows for a movie they have to make a game for it am i right?  But it dosent surprise me that the actual actors aren't in it.<br />But it was epic.
0375869026|5.0|I read this book and loved it! I am now reading it out loud to 110 fifth graders and they ASK if I am going to read it every day! They love it! It is a great book to talk about how to treat people! And truly, just an absolutely amazing book!!!
B000WC3AKI|5.0|I know it's not exactly scientifically correct, but it's still an awesome movie.<br /><br />The DVD came in perfect condition and we can't wait to see the extra bonus stuff that wasn't available to us when we had the VHS during childhood.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Great CD.  Andrea Bocelli is amazing.  I have listened to it over and over and over.  Never get tired of hearing him sing.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I liked this album, good stuff.  Has to be better then the National  and the depressing Indie crap.  Stone cold Honky.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was easy to read and definitely a page turner. I've always liked Jodi Piccoult's books and this was no exception. Although there's often a sad tone to her books, I find myself feeling thankful for life once the book is finished. Now go read it!
B000W93CHC|1.0|Ken Follett used to be a great writer who could capture your imagination and challenge your beliefs.  That's why it's so sad to see how far Follett has fall as he's gotten older.  It's impossible to read World Without End without becoming bored with the insipid dialogue and rote plot lines.  In addition, it seems that Follett has grown into a dirty old man, reveling in including an explicit sex scene every 20 pages or so that has no bearing on the story arc.  He seems to revel in describing rapes, sodomy, random sex, and graphic petting, often as a backdrop to mundane conversations. I'm no Puritan, but after about the 10th sex scene in the first 1/4 of the book, most of which go to great lengths to describe the participants' pubic hair, it begins to get a little creepy.  I can only assume that Follett has tired of coming up with original plot devices and has instead decided to fall back on the old sex sells maxim.  Lastly, the transposition of modern attitudes and mores into the Middle Ages is farcical, as is the constant preaching about progressive ideologies.  I'm perfectly aware at how backwards societal conventions and relationships were during the Middle Ages, I don't need a sermon on it.  Good historical fiction places an engrossing story in the midst of an earlier time, it doesn't just dress up people with modern ideologies and plop them down into unfair circumstances.  Don't waste your time.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|this game is not too interesting to me.  It is a good game however. you basically collect coins and try to survive a level
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|for anyone condisering buying this album, DO NOT think twice. i would pay 10x the price and it would still be worth it to me. i love killswitch, and to me, listeing to this album, this is the REAL killswitch. must buy.
B005HSL626|3.0|This game is just alright and slicing fruit in real life and or on games is just boring.  It's decent
B00CFQMVLS|3.0|This movie was better than I expected based on reviews.  It's no masterpiece but I still enjoyed it.  I'm a die hard fan, generally speaking, so I knew I'd eventually watch this but I put it off based on the terrible reviews.  You have to be willing to accept a ton of very implausible action.  It's fun as a spectacle as long as you don't start thinking about realism.  I don't know what people are expecting from die hard 5 that they'd be so dissappointed in this.  It's die hard 5, fairly entertaining and very rowdy.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|this is an amazing product that literally makes sure that my kindle fire runs smooth.  It is worth the cheap price
0345803485|4.0|Quick and easy book. Story is fast moving and keeps you guessing. Overall good book. Looking forward to book two and three.
B003XT603Q|5.0|Haruki Murakami's book reads like a poem. The raw emotion might catch you off guard. A Catcher in the Rye meets Of Human Bondage.
1452115567|4.0|I picked up this book after i saw it on the Ellen Show.  The pictures speak a thousand words.  The bond between the owner and Maddie the dog whom he rescued is pretty neat.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Its big, colorful and works well with kindle. A must have for all your financial needs.  I use it instead of my old Texas Insturment.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|What more could you ask for.  Amazing Trilogy and an even more amazing price.  Its a nice collection and much cheaper than buying individually.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I'm with the overwhelming majority of folks here. No 2D disc, no sale. 3D is hype, and worse, is hype most people can't watch. I'll order from Amazon.UK.<br /><br />Disney has a bunch of boneheads working in its marketing group.
0374533571|5.0|I heard from a co-worker that The Silver Linings Playbook was a great movie..so i decided to see for myself and read the novel before watching the movie.  I read this book in 2 days and loved it.  I have seen the trailer for the movie and i can tell you right now the book is 100 times better...as they always are..highly recommend
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Loads of fun for myself and my Grandchildren. we work on it together. I would recommend it as something to play for all ages.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I saw this movie on HBO with my daughter and she watched it on our DVR repeatedly until i deleted it for more space...I then looked on Amazon and found it for such a great deal i couldnt pass it up.
B004IY1AKS|5.0|Hearing Paranoid on Vinyl as a child is what kicked off my love of hard rock and heavy metal music. The 180 gram edition does not dissappoint. If I had one complaint, it's that this does not include the gatefold cover.
0062107062|4.0|Very engrossing story if you have had any military experience. Tragic considering<br />how he survived all that and then died at the hands of a disturbed individual while<br />home in the USA. Very sad and such a waste.
B00AGII2W4|1.0|Received Sherlock Holmes A game of Shadows. Item was not wrapped, when I opened it look as if someone did a VERY, VERY, POOR job of wiping off the front of the DVD, there was a white sticker on the top..not sure what that is supppose to be for, I turned it over there are scartches on the back and some stick stuff..finger printed all over the back of the DVD. I will be returning this item..disappointed!
1451695195|5.0|Insightful look into what I believe is true.<br />A lot has been written by others which supports his experience.<br />His story makes it very hard to refute the issue, especially considering<br />the facts concerning his Sister.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Marvelous plot. Great characters. This is by far the best sequel of novel.  Keeps you on pins and needles to see what really is going on.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I installed this calculator on my toshiba tablet it works great and it has a gigantic screen easy for any one to read

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good game for me because I really like temple run but this was way cool so I also like how you have to get away from a fat guy with a moustach...I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS!!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Beach Buggy Blitz is a fun action packed racecar game with obstacles that you've never imagined. Along with playing alone you can also play with friends. There are also different ways you can play, including: touch mode, device mode, controller mode. Yeah, I said controller mode. I mean the people who made this game should be trillionaires.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|score. 2600 on time &amp; get. 25000. score 2600 again. and if you points are higher. and 1000. not sure how The y work.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This movie was a tad cheesy but kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Fantastic movie choice if you like pop outs and creepy movement hah. The grudge meets sleepy hollow
0545128285|5.0|This book came quickly, and in PERFECT condition!  I have a hard time believing it was even used..seems like it came right from the distributor!
B004GYY714|5.0|I use it more than Pandora because it doesn't keep asking me if I am still listening.  I have problems sleeping so I keep it on all night.
0316228532|5.0|This book took awhile to ship, but not an outrageous amount of time.  The book was almost like new, just a few marks on the cover.  I am extremely impressed with the price and quality.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is a nice case, very handy to use and portable. Was exactly what I expected and I like it
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have used this calculator several times.  Numbers are large enough to see good.  Helps with grocery buying. You need to get this for your Kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is chocked full of excitement and challenges!  Everyday the challenges.increase and the fun endures always something and someplace new on the horizon lots of addictive fun and zero calories.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This Mahjong game is just to easy to play.  It's easy for kids to play.  My Granddaughter plays this one on my Kindle Fire.
B003YUOL1C|4.0|The fit is right on. They are so light, it feels like going barefoot. I needed a shoe to relax in for the summer months, and now I have found the right ones. These shoes are even better than I expected.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This was such an adult movie!....no action chases...no shooting...no violence.  Just a delightful scenario of a group of aging people.
141659521X|5.0|Mr Flynn has written a current, well paced and very realistic story.  Without giving away any of this tale of this CIA layered novel, Flynn delivers here.  The development spins easily.  A breeze to read.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is so enjoyable it's hard to stop playing once I start. Love it! cannot wait for more games like it
B001GA1RFA|4.0|I THHOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT BOOK AND I WOULD LOVE TO READ IT AGAIN. I IT IS ABOUT.  GUY NAMED COLIN WHO ONLY WENT OUT WITH KATHEEINES. one day COLIN WENT ON A ROAD TRIP WITH HIS BEST FREIND. FROM THEN ON THEY LEARNED A LOT.<br /><br />THIS BOOK WAS GREAT
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Well, I had no clue what I was getting into with this one, but it was actually pretty intriguing. Lots of twists which I love and a good deal of background on comic book history thrown in. If there's a sequel out there, I need to read it, too!
0385333846|1.0|This book has creeped me out to the max! There are so many disgusting morbid descriptions and after finishing this book a few weeks ago, I still feel haunted by this book! How can such junk even get published?! We live in such a screwed up society that would even publish such a book. I understand Vonnegut may have been traumatized by the war but it is unacceptable to promote such books that are so demeaning to society. This book is also racist. It makes fun of people from certain countries. Some parts are so violently disturbing that it is worse than watching a horror movie for crying out loud! I am so upset about this book. Do not read this book unless you want to keep waking up in the middle of the night, freaked out!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have had this app on all electronics I can get apps on, it works and is free apples. Banana. Hi.
B002M9WW30|5.0|this set is any boxing fans classic movie set plus to get them in blu ray is even better the movieslook good plus lots of extra footage
1607066017|5.0|I love this comic.  It is probably the best new ongoing comic series now.  Back issues of the original 6 comics can be prohibitively expensive, with first prints of issue one going for $100 on ebay, so this volume (and the forthcoming Vol. 2 collecting issues 7-12) is great for fans getting into Saga late.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This is a great album; I immediately fell in love with nearly every song on the album. Great music, but some provocative lyrics.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|The scenes in New Mexico work much better than those set in the effects laiden Asgard.  Tom Hiddleston is terrific as Loki, and you can see why Marvel brought him back to be the bad guy in The Avengers.  If you missed this movie, check it out now.  It serves as a fitting prelude to last year's The Avengers.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|could not find this locally, was giving up. thank you so much for having this. my daughter and grandsons love this movie
B002ZG99TK|4.0|You may not realize it when you watch Unstoppable for the first time, but nearly every shot of trains and helicopters and various other vehicles was made using real trains, helicopters, cars, etc.  Late director Tony Scott (Top Gun) barely utilizes CGI in staging the chaotic action that unfolds in this true life inspired runaway train thriller, and it is truly refreshing to see an action movie that gets by using practical effects, using CGI only when he couldn't safely create the onscreen action with real vehicles.  Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are both pretty good in their roles.  This movie is far from being deep, but is an enjoyable escape.
6305428050|5.0|this was a movie my daughters wore me out watching when they were kids and when my adult daughter open this up for Christmas she was in tears. she loved it. thank you
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I've been wanting to read this novel for ages, and just never had the time. Finally I sat down and read it, and I realized how close to home Charlie's story is to my life... It's a beautiful novel,and really puts things onto perspective.
0062086529|4.0|I love this book from my childhood and purchased the board book for my infant son. It is a bit long to hold his attention, but I still am glad we have it.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I liked this book it just took a while for it to pick up,  I'm glad there was more about the family members on both sides in this book. It helped to explain things a little better
037582913X|5.0|This book was one of my husband's favorites as a child, so of course I had to buy it for our baby boy. He's probably too young to really appreciate it, but it is definitely a fun book to read aloud to him!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It's better than the :&#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy.  Super acting, directing, visual effects. and scenery, better than LOTR trilogy.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I was surprised about this game. Got it when it was the faotd. Easy to understand, fun to play, would have bought it if it wasn't released for free. I was not disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I wasn't interested in this show at first. I heard everyone talking about it, I decided to check it out and oh!! my goodness I could not stop watching!! I just to purchase Season 3 to see how it would turn out. Love !! Love!! Everything about it , costumes, the yummy food, and actors all wonderful! What can I say can't wait for season 4!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I saw these gentlemen on a fund raiser for a public televison channel.  I was hooked.  When I saw that they had out a CD, I knew I had to get it.  You will not be disappointed.
159562015X|3.0|It was ok, but not great. I found the book to be just a bunch of characteristics for reference. THe Survey was good, and fairly accurate.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was such a sexy, funny and cute story!!!  I was worried it was going to be a cliff hanger since it shows it a series but it had a great ending!  I even found myself reading part of the story to my husband as Drew has some great lines, points and perspective! Can't wait to read another book from this author :)
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|The friendship between the characters was lovely and adorable!! It would have been great if there was some suspense added to the love story..
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Because it has sub-titles, you need to be ready to read quickly.  It is a movie that gets through to your heart.  It makes you feel happy and yet touches the heart with a little sadness.  Absolutely a wonderful movie.  I enjoyed it.
0785165975|5.0|The book is printed on good quality paper and the binding is very tight.<br />The colors are bright.  Worth the money for the Hardcover edition.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|When I finished the Farseer series, I was left wanting more. Then I discovered that the series continued in the Tawny Man Trilogy, and continues to tell the Fool's tale in the Mad/Live Ship series. Thank you Ms. Hobb!! It enriched all of the series to see the interconnection, the continuation of the characters and their story lines. I love everything Ms. Hobb has written and will continue to be a die-hard fan.
B003IY48PS|5.0|This is not a review of the movie, just the product.<br />The quality of this blu ray is very good.<br />The picture is sharp and the colors are bright and clear.  The audio is also very clear.<br />Behind the scenes stuff is satisfactory.<br />Worth the money paid for it.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Eric's voice has only gotten better with age. The songs are just his style and he performs them with the vim and vigor of the Animals Days in the spot light. If you like the Blues, you'll love this
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is not a review of the movie.<br />The quality of the blu ray is excellent.  The picture was sharp and the colors were vibrant.  The audio was very good.  It was worth the price I paid for it.
B00AA0U05A|3.0|It is just ok. nothing special about the musical arrangements and her inflections are lack luster. I'm not writing a book
B005IA9JZO|5.0|The quality of the blu ray is very good.<br />The picture is sharp and the sound is clear.<br />Worth the money.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love this movie! It's one of the best superhero movies I've seen (other than The Dark Knight Rises) recently. Can't wait for the second one!
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|This is not a review of the movie, just the product.<br />The quality of this blu ray is very good.<br />The picture is sharp and the colors are bright and clear.  The audio is also very clear.<br />Behind the scenes stuff is satisfactory.<br />Worth the money paid for it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enjoyable, light reading.  A bit &#34;young&#34; for us old folks and a little short of the fantasy/SF of the days of yore.  Still I enjoyed reading the book and recommend it for folks who like this genre.
B00AEFY44Y|5.0|Most people know the story.<br />The quality of the Blu Ray is very good.  Sound is clear and the picture is sharp.<br />Satisfactory behind the scenes stuff.<br />Worth the price.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|If you're a Whovian YOU NEED THIS! Just buy it. Trust me, you won't regret it. It's so much fun!
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|This is not a review of the movie.<br />The quality of the blu ray is excellent.  The picture was sharp and the colors good.  The audio was also very good.  It was worth the price I paid for it.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Works as promised. Only challenge you may face is getting used to using it, especially if you already have a traditional keyboard/mouse setup and are looking to transition to the G13.<br />Pros:<br />- Very easy setup<br />- Very easy to configure and switch between profiles<br />- Analog stick makes movement in games more comfortable (rather than holding down the W key)<br />Cons:<br />- None
B00AEFXE3Q|5.0|This is not a review of the movie.<br />The quality of the blu ray is very good.  The picture was sharp and the colors good.  The audio was also very good.  It was worth the price I paid for it.
1455508977|5.0|If you enjoy Nicholas Sparks books, you will enjoy this one! I enjoyed watching the movie first then reading the book.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|The picture was sharp and the sound was clear.  This is a very good blu ray copy and wort the money I paid for it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think that the mockingjay did well by ending the hunger games. E<br />nough people died for the capitals games.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Throughly enjoyed. A fun ride. Explosions, aliens, Liam, Skarsgard and Taylor look no futher for an exciting couple of hours.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I was playing a mission and next thing I know I am going through walls and everything. I finished the mission despite the glitch and when I thought I did the security passes you collect weren't showing up and I killed all the guards... after that I tried it again and it was still glitching out and this time I was able to get the passes but when I was on the jetpack a boat was flying in the air and killed me. So bad and good game. They need to fix the the glitches though.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I loved Django.  Jamie Foxx and the entire cast were terrific.  I've seen the movie at least three times and will probably seen it many more times.
B00AQSF6BO|1.0|I will grant that Vicente Amigo can be an amazing guitarist.  I have enjoyed his earlier, more main line flamenco CD's and efforts a great deal.  Recently, he has strayed more into music inspired by other cultures or settings.  This is more than a stray.  It is primarily a celtic cross-over, and, if you weren't aware that Vicente were the central figure, it would not be obviously clear that this is a guitarist's album, much less one by a world class talent.  This in and of itself wouldn't necessarily be bad, but the fact is that it is also lightweight.  No guts.  I found myself thinking the \\"elevator music\\" epithet about half way through my first listen.  I'm not sure it will ever get a second one.  If you are new to Vicente Amigo and are looking for a CD to try, go to the very opposite end of his career and start there, back when he was blowing people away.  If you want complex guitar based music inspired by outside-of-the-British Isles celtic settings, try Pierre Bensusan, as an example.
193700788X|1.0|Would I have read it had I looked at the reviews, yes. Would I have saved for my special birthday quiet time read...no way! Charlaine must be glamored to think this is good writing!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Easy to use, you ca pick it up right away.  Instead of writing notes I use this to help remember things.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it gives me a horse and I take care of itand do compitions with it . its a great game for all ages.
B005DOJ68K|2.0|The recording quality was poor I was hoping for a clearer recording.  Still like the songs just not this recording.
B00AEBB89W|5.0|I really like true stories.  This movie keeps you glued to your seat. Even my daughter who picks apart everything, watched it twice to point out key parts. Make sure you don't turn the end off to soon or you'll miss it.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|My wife lost one of the movies in her series and I had to get this for her. Its exactly as described but she did mention that it doesn't have some of the (Extra, Deleted) scenes that they show on TV. It's good, it's Harry Potter.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, who has always been a Cirque Du Soleil fan. She said it was very good and up to their high standards of performance. So, based on that, if you are interested in this kind of thing (performing art, I guess) then the money is well spent.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is addictive but can be expensive.  free diamonds should be given as each level is reached.  I also wish all the rooms didn't need so many extras to search._
B001R3YRG2|5.0|The protagonist goes through all sorts of experiences that older people have to endure every day. I watched this movie because it was recommended to me by my brother, and it was excellent. When you watch it, you are certain to see things that you have experienced yourself. I would love to give some examples but I don't want to spoil the movie for you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved it from start to finish. Very challenging. I was sad when it was over. I'm looking forward to playing games of this type again.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I enjoy having this on my Kindle. I live in a deep forest, and this time of year the trees are very dense and block the view of the sky except just overhead at my place. I have a small meadow and I can see the sky from it.  The moon phase program is nice, because sometimes late at night, I can take a look at it and if the moon is full or close to it, it's worth going out to the meadow and enjoying the moonlight.
B002MVNE4E|5.0|By the 10th and final season in the series you are either a fan or not, lol. Chances are you wouldn't be hunting for this season if you didn't like the show or want to see how it ends- It will not dissapoint. When I was laid up from my hysterectomy and couldn't get of the couch my husband and I ended up watching the entire series from start to finish and it was fun for us both (especially me since I never followed the series when it was on). Definitely recommend for all Smallville fans.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|There are some historical inaccuracies , true enough. But in terms of the culture and mind set of that period in Japanese history, it's spot on.  This is a book that is hard to put down once you get started. I've read some of Clavell's other stuff, which is good, but this is the pick of the litter.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|superdeeduper.  is how I describe this game.  seems to be from the makers of jetpack joyride,  so that's a plus.  in summary: supercool
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I bought this movie and enjoyed it so much that I loaned it to my brother, and now it is making the rounds of my extended family all over the country. I don't expect to get it back in this life time, so I bought another one.  I am a collector of period firearms, and I have a collection of military history books that numbers over 2000.  If there had been gross inaccuracies in the film (or even slight ones in some respects) I would have recognized them.  My father, my father in law, and my uncle all fought in the Pacific War so I am very interested in it. This movie was based on two books by men who fought there, both of which I've read, and the script writers were very true to their stories. If you have any interest in World War II military history, or the Pacific War specifically, you can't be without this. Just don't loan it to anyone, unless you are willing to sacrifice a copy in the hopes of some twenty something age group nephews and nieces learning something.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I used this film in my Comparative Politics class. The students really had a better understanding of Margaret Thatcher & her policies after watching her life dramatized.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My sister told me I had to read the trilogy.  Once I started the first book, could not put it down until I finished it.  The same with the second book.  The third book was a little far fetched for me, but I did read it.  It tied everything together.  The book is so much better than the movie, am so glad I read the books before I saw the movie.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|I love this movie.. I know it will be a classic in my collection. Yes it got cheesy at the end. But don't they all?!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I am stuck  the last crayon  in the bedroom it is behind the back button on Kindle Fire HD had to use the hint button to find it but can't get it because the back button is covering it. I got it now you must in large the picture and move it so that you can get to the crayon. I do love the came I have so much fun with the hidden images and the mystery of the game.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|A wonderful story about the life of Jay Moriarity, a boy whose drive and positive attitude continues to this day to influence others to be their best. Excellent movie.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|My car radio does not understand how loud I need this album to play. Absolutely genius music. BUY IT NOW!
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Enjoyed this movie! I recommend it for everyone to enjoy and watch. There is something for everyone in this movie.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I am just a fan of this game.. keeps my mind sharp I think.  Easy to use and all that.
B00023B1LC|5.0|Enjoyed this movie! I recommend it for everyone to enjoy and watch. There is something for everyone in this movie.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|can see where they needed to explain parts for those unfamiliar with the story. but was disappointed because for me it tended to drag on in parts. also disappointed it will be in 3 parts. guess they neede to make money or something.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Enjoyed this movie! I recommend it for everyone to enjoy and watch. There is something for everyone in this movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham delivers a witty, innovative storyline in this one. Several &#34;twists&#34; keep me guessing almost to the end. The prose may pithy and descriptions brief, but that just allows one's imagination to take over. Fun read!!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Only reason it got 4 stars is short length. I love a great challenge and this game is it. The hints were just enough to help when I needed it, and not too much to give away the answers. I can't wait for more of the Room.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Mr. Lenzen is an amazing artist. This book is a must for anyone wanting to tie paracord knots or other decorative and useful knots.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Feels like Diablo with good graphics. Very fast game play. Simply the best rpg game played yet. But still items or gems must be bought by real money which should the fun a bit.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Really fun maintains your interest. Not all just hidden pictures but lots of puzzles. Really like it good quality game. Def will play more
B0002TJGQS|4.0|they were exactly what I expected packaged well and work great. i will buy them again when I need more of them.
0785168109|5.0|I won't go into too much detail, but for the price and quality of this book I can only use one word \\"awesome\\". So many different pictures, sketches, art, background regarding the ironman costume it can be mindboggling, but of course in a good way. For any Ironman, Robert Downey Jr or Marvel fan, this is a must have. It's def worth the money!!
0425098478|5.0|I was asked by my manager to read this book and I am so glad that I did it is awesome! It was shipped quickly to me and I would order items again from you!
B00009ZYC0|3.0|There is something that intriques me, and as well repulses me from any futuristic look at mankind. First and foremost, the dates of story occurrence. The year is again almost within our same neighborhood but just a few decades away, 2054. And yet so much has dramatically changed. Time & time again history has proven that change is simply not overnight or even within a few years time span. Therefore it is hard to take serious the monumental look of the futuristic cities this film has with it's overblown technologies.<br />I'm still not over the fact that 2001: A Space Odyssey did not ever occur in that NASA is temporarily bankrupt in misions, ideas, and endeavors in the year 2013 with only a slight hint of space stations, mars expeditions, and various clean up ideas of space crap. It seems the big thing is to predict asteroids coming to earth at great speeds barely missing us, and what would happen if one of them made contact, is still on the board.<br />Where are the disney friendly space station tours? At Disneyland, of course.<br />One thing that bothers me about the futuristic outlook of man is the fact not all who inhabit the earth are in compliance with this outlook on technological superiority. As a matter of fact, there is a great deal of obstical in that a great portion of the people just think it is simply cinema movie drama technology, and will never happen that way in reality. Perhaps with that way of thinking.<br />I would say this kind of material in this movie could possibly occur in the year 2350 because it would take a great deal more of prospering generations to accomplish than a pack of weapon crazed home boys sporting tattoos, baggy pants, and backward caps to ever produce since sabotage is really the name of their game, and cops have more than they can handle while techno geeks dream on, and some even produce those grand gadgets we imagine possible, making the world of tomorrow a better place in which to live.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Both the case and screen protector are perfect fits.  I've had both on my iPhone 4S for over a year now and see no reason to change.
0470424656|4.0|I wanted to read this book for years, and recently got around to purchasing it.  Honestly, I was a bit disappointed because this book is more theoretical than it is practical.  I personally believe that \\"Valuing a Business, 5th Edition: The Analysis and Appraisal of Closely Held Companies,\\" by Pratt and Niculita; \\"Financial Valuation: Applications and Models\\" by Hitchner, et al.; and even \\"Investment Banking: Valuation, Leveraged Buyouts, and Mergers and Acquisitions,\\" by Rosenbaum and Pearl are much better purchases if you are seeking to understand how to value a business.<br /><br />Please do not misunderstand me, this is a respectable book by the venerable McKinsey & Co.  However, it is long on theory and short on practicum. If you are looking for a book on the mechanics of valuation, this is not the book for you.  Conversely, if you have mastered the mechanics of valuation and want to graduate to more heady theoretical ground, then you will find no better book than this.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this game. Its just great. Its a matching game like bejeweled but it has so much more. You gain recourses as you make matches and then spend them on upgrades. I just beat the game. Very sad that it ended! It's one of those games that once you finish it,  you wish there was more!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I would recommend this for anyone. Having a hard time deciding who they are.... just be your self...don't dwell on what others think. Some parts of the book made me laugh til I was crying..  If I was having a hard day or just needed some cheering up I would pick up this book and 're-read chapters that made me feel good...Ellen has away to make you smile. Want to thank Ellen....for the great book...

1608955702|5.0|Van Niekerk is kind of an a$$.  My book arrived defective and I didn't realize it till what I thought would be too late.  I contacted VN and he basically told me too dang bad.  Thankfully Amazon rescued me and solved the problem.  While I don't much care for author's personality, I do admire (and learn) from his talent.

0671015206|4.0|I am only a third of the way into this book, but I want to see this book will teach you how to better live for your future.  There are a lot of key points made in this book that can change your look upon finances, but to truly become a millionaire is directly related to ones income and investment efforts early on, but its never to late to start either.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is fun. Playing with friends is even more fun. I say this game  is really fun,it has creative and survival which is cool.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This book takes you places you have not been.  It helps us remember we have choices and that each of us are pilot of our own lives.  Words can't really explain this book it is more an experience through the author's mind.  He wrote it in 9 days which is magical in and of itself.  I think something like 12M copies sold.  Must read.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Gangstar Rio is so cool. The storyline is perfect,the desings and graphics are good,and fun too play. So I think this game should deserve a 5!
B008B9JSD2|4.0|Although made several years before the recent papal election, this movie seems especially timely this year, and makes one wonder if other popes have been elected against their will. Rather than the rollicking fun and satire of most of Nanni Moretti's films, a more gentle humor and poignancy prevail here, as when the unwilling new pope says to an unsuspecting psychiatrist, &#34;I'm an actor.&#34; The movie seems about 15 minutes too long, which could be remedied by drastically cutting the substory of the theater and real actors.

B000HC2LI0|2.0|Greetings fellow amazonians I just picked this up after completing the series \\"Home Improvement\\" (I was a little disappointed with that series because I was going to use some of the tips to upgrade my trailer over the next few months). I was hoping for a show that was going to delve into the mysteries of the white house.  Too bad this was just some lame drama with charlie sheens dad in it.  If I wanted to see a terrible parent I can just go visit my mom in LA. Anyhoo needless to say I was very disappointed with the West wing, but I will give it two stars for the inclusion of a lot of great scenery. Maybe I can take some decorating queues from the White House and spruce up my trailer after all.
B000SEI230|5.0|The content is humorous and sad at the same time. I loved the way Sparks verbalized his choice of words and also the reaction of the negative people later in the book.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone!

1451695195|1.0|I was excited to read this book, but was very disappointed in the end.  First, as others have noted, Dr. Alexander comes across as fairly narcissitic to the point where he basically says he had the most \\"real\\" NDE in recorded history.  That is absurb. Second, there is no \\"proof\\" here (and I am a Christian and believe in going to heaven or hell when we die). That said, the \\"proof\\" falls short in this book.  There is no way to prove the neocortex didn't have some level of activity and most of the explanations, while implausible, cannot be ruled out completely since there is no direct way of measuring some of the prosscess or chemcials that might have been involved. Finally, others have noted that Dr. Alexander glosses over shortcomings in his personal and professional life.  While those shortcomings are not relative to the story of his NDE, the fact that Dr. Alexandar spends so much time discussing his personal life and professional accomplishments lead me to believe he should have been more direct with readers in discussing these issues if he felt the need to discuss them at all. Frankly, the best parts of the book and the most \\"proof\\" were toward the end when Dr. Alexander tells the story of a patient and a fellow neurosurgeon who had relatives who had some profound NDE experiences.

B00280LYIM|5.0|This books keep getting better and better, don't they?<br />I want to make this brief and spoiler free, just in case someone  who hasn't read the book reads it.<br />I am 13 years old and hard to please in the reading department, really, the books that have always caught my attention are those of adventure and fantasy (for example Harry Potter) and this book has it.<br />After reading The Titan's Curse I believed the books couldn't get any better, and I was proved wrong.<br />The Battle of the Labyrinth is amazing, it has a lot of fighting, some interesting things about Greek mythology that I never knew about, a little romance (We all know we're just waiting for Percy's and Annabeth's friendship to evolve into something bigger!), funny stuff and much more!!<br />We get to see more of characters that had disappeared (*cough*  Nico *cough*) and meet very interesting new people!<br />I highly recommend this, and if you're reading this then there's two things you can do:<br />1. If you haven't read the book then what the hell are you waiting for? Go get it!<br />2. If you have read this book then buy the next one! It's what I'm gonna do right now!
B0000024YL|5.0|These guys I grew up with, and what an honor it was. &#34;the sound of silence has always been my favorite song from them and it meant something. these guys were so good together and i really missed them when they split, you just can't find this kind of music anymore.  Thank you paul and Art for some of the greatest music of our time. BEST WISHES!

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Well what can i say about Sam and Dean. this show rocks we enjoy it so much..thanks guys! Eric k. i hope your story goes on for many more seasons. I have never enjoyed a show more as i have this one. I love the humor in these stories, Dean is just so funny. Sam on the more serious side until he becomes evil, then he's somewhat funny. but i miss Bobby, Bobby kept these boys inline! i wish you would bring him back. Then there is the second Meg(Rachael Miner) who i absolutely love in this show love her one liners she is so funny.And then there is Castiel who i just adore. not so much on the evil side but he's very funny at times too. the cast is just a wonderful blend of real talent it's very refreshing. I wish Geniveve would come back her and her husband worked so well together on the show, very professional. wtg guys!!! best of luck to the show and writers and all cast and crew you're very entertaining and very very talented to say the least. thank you thank you for a wonderful show...keep it coming please.<br /><br />I do love this show, it's very entertaining, but really, why all the ruff swearing in the show? and why does every show out there have to show being gay is ok? IT IS NOT OK!! read the Holy Bible in leviticus it tells you how God actually feels about this. If they are going to quote parts of the Bible i wish they would do it correctly. demons and angels? to boot evil Angels? ahhhhhhh NO that's not what God does and God will NEVER just disappear when some are in heaven. that is not how he works.
1584282584|5.0|I have read and reread this book and most importantly have started implementing its ideas.  Now when shooting with only on-camera flash my photos look much better.  Learn the art of the &#34;bounce&#34; and getting over your fear of high iso and wide aperture.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|I was so looking forward to owning this video.  The actors  are performers that I have enjoyed in the past and I was curious about the plot as I saw the promos.  It was a beautiful moviie, kind of a coming of age for my age group. My only disappointment was I expected a comedy and it definitely wasn't.  It was worth watching however.
0553801473|1.0|I really wouldn't bother with this book, just wait for the HBO series to catch up.  The story goes no where and actually loops back to a Feast of Crows.  A good story should flow like swimming across a river, and all this book did was tread stagnant water.  This book should have been shortened and simply added to a Feast of Crows.  I am not sure I will continue with the series if this is the poor quality of writing we can expect.  If Mr. Martin is suffering from writers block then maybe he should turn the book over to a writer that won't \\"phone\\" in a story.

B009NY43NY|4.0|Well I must be in the very small minority of Charlaine Harris' dedicated readers who felt she ended this book in pretty much the only fashion I expected and was happy with that ending.  I personally feel that if you have truly read her books and followed Sookie from the beginning you could not have really imagined her ending up with either Bill or Eric.  Sookie emphatically stated she did not want to become a vampire and to have turned her against her will would have destroyed the character Charlaine has built.  Series ends will never make everyone happy, espeically when a love triangle is involved, but this series has always had more than that triangle and I personally have predicted to family that Sam would be her best shot at a lasting \\"normal\\" relationship from the beginning.  To say that relationship came out of left field seems odd since I can remember numerous little scenes that have hinted at this spark over many of the books. I am surprised by how many people have turned on Ms Harris because of the ending she chose as the writer and creator of these characters.<br /><br />I felt Dead Ever After did a tremendous job of tying up, and weaving together, the threads left from previous stories.  She made me believe that Sookie might actually have a chance to live without being some vamps pawn and without being threatened, at least for a little while.  The courtroom scene with all the townspeople to support her brought a tear to my eye, as did the Eric breakup scene which, although harsh, was about as honest as those two had ever been with one another.  I applaud Ms. Harris for staying true to her vision of the books, which I would bet she has had almost from conception, and not bending to the hordes who wanted the impossible.

B003UESJJC|5.0|As a long time fan of Apocalypse Now I have purchased two other versions of the film on both VHS and DVD, but when this new Blu Ray appeared I purchased it right away.  The set contains both the original release and the ReDux, but the extras are what put it over the top.  Not only do you get Hearts of Darkness, which is a must for even the casual fan, all of the featurettes are intersting and enlightening.  There are great interviews with the actors and filmakers, all looking back on the production with the benefit of hindsight.  And you get a great booklet with a number of memos from the set which are very interesting.  Not to mention it is a very good Blu Ray transfer.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is very addictive and fun. I would highly recommend this app for people of all ages. This app also teaches your brain different strategies for other games like this, like temple run. What's better about this game then temple run is it is more colorful and bright. The only bad thing about this game is the many many many advertisements. I always hate how you have to ex out all the advertisements before the game starts. Other than that, this game is a great one to have on you kindle. That is why I gave this app four stars.
B00CIZZKDW|5.0|I have liked OMD forever.  When I heard about this thing I was pretty happy, though my chance of getting my hands on one of these things seemed slim.  Only 300 produced in the US.  Regardless I got my hands on this set and couldn't be happier.  Everything you want to know about these guys is in here and it is just a fun little set.  There are songs and videos of their greatest stuff.  If you already have everything you could skip this but if you are a completest, you are going to have to find yourself a copy.

B008JFUOWM|5.0|I HAVE ALL 5 FAST & FURIOUS MOVIES AND THEY KEEP GETTING BETTER FAST 6 IS A 5 STAR MOVIE ALL AROUND  AND YES THERE IS A FAST 7 COMING  2015 this movie ROCKED!!! A lot of action and a part or two that brought tears to my eyes... I can't wait to BUY THIS MOVIE!!!  he best part of these films (outside of the cars) is waiting to see in what direction the story will be taken next. Like the popular Marvel films, the Fast & Furious franchise has adopted the \\"scene after the credits\\" to help set up the lead-in for the next film. For example, Fast & Furious was a direct lead-in to Fast Five, while Fast Five's ending saw the return of Eva Mendes to drop the bombshell about Letty still being alive - and well, Tokyo Drift supposedly taking place out of order is just plain strange (especially since viewers already know the ultimate fate of Han). How does Fast & Furious 6 end? Well, you'll have to go to the theater to get the answer to that question, but let's just say a HUGE A-list actor will be taking the reins in Fast 7 as the main villain. This scene also ties up a MAJOR loose end from Tokyo Drift that wasn't even a loose end at the time. Sound confusing? Well, go watch the film and ask questions after.<br /><br />Overall, Fast & Furious 6 is a terrific addition to the franchise, featuring no shortage of big engines, big thrills - and a rather large tank. Team Torreto continues to hit on all cylinders and will easily cross the finish line at the box office with another victory under their belt - paving the way for next year's sequel (which everyone will be clamoring about after the final scene of the film). Feel free to buy your tickets in advance, because Fast & Furious 6 is a MUST SEE.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Very Challenging and Addictive with an Enjoyable style.  Very Smooth with Realistic Physics movements and results from varying strategies to catch stars and Feed Candy to Om Nom.  Lots of interesting and Fun Items to help achieve success.  There are Rubber Ropes, Floating Bubbles, Air Puffers, Extendable Rope Cannons, Sliding Rope Attachments, etc.  Gameplay is Engaging and gives your brain a good workout.  Gets harder as levels progress.  The Graphics are VERY CUTE, Colorful and interesting.  Music and Sound Effects are great and can be Muted.<br /><br />App has Links to ONLINE Cartoon Videos and other Game Advertising but it's not excessive.<br /><br />OVERALL:  A HIGHLY POLISHED game app that works Flawlessly and is Fun and Satisfying.  It has great Replay Value.  Includes175 Levels so far.  Also, the Commentary during play is cute and funny.  Definitely one of the Best Physics apps.  I would highly Recommend it to all.

B00COHAUD4|2.0|Mama is a modern ghost tale that tells the story of two girls lost in the woods for five years, and are somehow taken care of by a mysterious force. From the start, the movie showed great potential. We are given a feasible situation where the girls are stranded in an abandoned home, a suitable demonstration where some new parents can step in, and a premise for a hopefully decent movie. Also, the way the girls de-evolve shortly into the movie to quadrapedal deranged social lunatics is an excellent effect and addition to the story. Very creepy.<br />Having said all this, I feel the movie falls a little short about half way in. Firstly, most of the scares are nothing but cheap jumps, loud noises, and eerie faces portruding from the darkness to try and make you jump in your seat. There really is not an imminent sense of danger throughout as the ghost simply plays with the girls and keeps them company. The first person harmed seems more a mishap than a malicious attempt to kill.<br />Secondly, the ending seemed almost silly. (Spoiler) We are submitted for our viewing pleasure to an almost reenactment of the ghost's past to where she seemingly involuntarily forced herself and her child over a cliff side, but this time with a new companion, the little girl throughout. Was this necessary for some ritual to stop the ghost from harming anyone else? I simply did not see the relevance, besides what I have just given.<br />Lastly, whenever someone goes by themselves into a dark house in the middle of the woods in the pitch black of night, in active pursuit of a ghost mind you, I seem to emotionally forego any caring for their death. In other words, if the person dies, I don't care because nobody would right do that in real life who wasn't suicidal or just plain stupid. This seemed to be a cheaply played scare, that did not really seem all that scary. It was more predictable than anything. Like most of the movie.<br />All in all, I was fairly disappointed by this movie, for the reasons listed above as well as others. I felt it to be extremely predictable and full of cheap 'make you jump' scenes and little intact horror. The ghost, while eerie and well produced, did little to make me care for her plight or backstory, other than a means of ending the movie. I would say watch this movie if you have a couple hours to burn on a rainy day with possibly nothing else to do. Maybe you'll like it, but I would definitively say that there are better horror/ ghost stories out there.easons listed above as well as others.

When I joined Amazon Prime...this show was one of the first ones I searched for and found! It has an on-going story line with good intrigue to 'keep you coming back for more'! I love my Amazon Prime Account and I am very pleased at the huge selection of movies and tv shows. It is well worth the cost of its membership...I would highly recommend Amazon Prime, and if you enjoy a good British saga you will also enjoy Downton Abbey.

B00B1RB942|5.0|This will be, in my opinion anyway, one of those films that will go down as one that has to be at least viewed, if not owned. I recommend purchasing it, though, because this is a great product, and you will be granted the luxury to view it at any time. As for why it is so good; as the description, and other reviews state, on the surface it's about a battle in cyberspace that leads to dire consequences, but it is so much more than that. There is themes of family, friendship, courage, satire of current society, and more that when combined, all boils down to a must-see movie. I was not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did, and I am more than pleased with the result.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I read this book as a book club recommendation.  I would suggest reading the author's forward first as it gives a lot of insight about the story.  Although I am not a history buff or particularly interested in air planes, this story held my interest and I did learn a lot about Germany and the Allies during WWII.  I would certainly recommend this book.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|We were expecting the complete season of Downton Abbey but got selected episodes.  It is evident there were very significant episodes that were not included.  That 'might' be  acceptable 'if' it had been made clear in the product description.  It created discontinuity and difficulty in understanding plot situations.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Fun little game. Wish it was more like the PC game but hopefully updates will help with that. good luck

4789009637|5.0|Great price and product! The shipping was so fast it came on the very first day that it was estimated to be possible. My jaw dropped when I went to the mailbox on the first day it could have been there trying not to get my hopes up and trying to be as patient as possible but it was right there! I was jumping up and down like it was Christmas! I love how this book can start from the very beginning to help even the very basic beginners out. My husband can learn along with me even though I am farther along in my Japanese than he is! This book is very detailed and it was exactly what I wanted/needed to have. I love it! &lt;3 So glad I ordered it!

B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a cute little app.  Keeps your brain thinking instead of just watching the idiotic stuff on TV.  I enjoy the challenges it provides.
B009E3EY38|5.0|They start kind of low profile. In the third song you can feel the powerful strenght of the best rock and roll band ever.<br />Once there are not many Led Zeppelin live performances available, this is become a must have.<br />Buy it, have it. Listening to the CD is as good as watching the Blue Ray.
B007JNWJMI|4.0|Its a good app. I would reccomend it although it doesn't save sometimes and also doesn't send to any other editing app. So if you want to edit pictures get it. It also doesn't edit videos.but overall its a pretty good app.
B001BKVWYQ|5.0|In an era of junk music we live in, finding Rodriguez' music (through the Searching for Sugar Man documentary), was like living in the 70's and sudenly another great album is released.<br />Great album. Well recorded and an absolute great presentation (I have the Vynil version) so congratulations to the producers. It does justice to a great musician and his first album. Do not miss it! Get the vynil version if you have the Turntable. Amazon will send you a mp3 version. Listening to the vynil and reading the lyrics on the large cover is just like going back to the good golden era of music. Priceless.
B0012DT9VK|5.0|This movie is probably my favorite movie<br />Thank you thank you thank you thank you<br />Roald Dahl for making this movie
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Seamless presentation of singers thousands of miles apart. Am a repeat buyer of this album of music that brings tears to one's eyes. Makes a wonderful gift.
1591844096|5.0|I liked this book so much, I recommended it to an employee of mine.  Godin does tend to belabor his points, so don't be surprised if you hear the same content over and over again (it can get tiresome), but the information is so good.  This book is the key to thriving in a career in the new economy.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved the chemistry between Drew and Kate and the humorous way this entire story was written!  I am looking forward to more of the Tangled Series!  Definitely buy and read this book!
B008220DGE|3.0|Nothing is worse than trying to consume our popular culture after it has been designated \\"great.\\"  I've lost count of how many people - real folks and film critics alike - who have raved about Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"The Master.\\"  But what people seem to like about it varies - I hear sweeping statements of the gorgeous look of the film, and rave reviews of the acting . . . but the story of a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) taking a drifter (Joaquin Phoenix) under his wing in post-WWII America never seems to really grab people.<br /><br />When I ask, \\"Do you want to see it again,\\" I get a lot of shrugs.<br /><br />That's ultimately how \\"The Master\\" left me.  Perhaps I am too middlebrow to appreciate this movie, but I think of a movie like I think of a painting.  I have some art of my walls that is not exactly high-falutin' stuff, but I love it.  I'm thinking of a highly expressionistic portrait of a jazzman honking away on a clarinet, and I love it even though it's far too amateur to ever hang in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  But then I think back to some of the paintings I've seen in famous museums and I would never have them on my walls for any price.  I can admire their craftsmanship, I suppose, but I don't want to ponder them.<br /><br />\\"The Master\\" is the same.  Chock full of terrific actors doing interesting things with complex characters, \\"The Master\\" is a film for film students.  I read the reviews online, trying to find what I should have loved in this movie, and I generally read reviewers who are trying to use their admiration for this movie to establish their own bona fides.<br /><br />I like Anderson's movies. I truly appreciated \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" and if it hadn't been for \\"No Country for Old Men\\" it may have been my favoriate movie of that year.  But this exploration of powerful men trying to shape the world somehow kept me at arm's length where \\"TWBB\\" brought me headfirst into its universe.<br /><br />Long story short, if you're going to be hanging with some cinephiles and want to establish your street cred, watch this movie and take extensive notes on the IMDB details.  I'm sure your \\"friends\\" will be impressed.  But I'd be shocked if you, on a surprise free evening, you peruse your film collection and say, \\"Hey, I haven't seen 'The Master' in two months - let's watch it again!\\"  If you're honest, you'll skip it and watch \\"Goodfellas\\" for the 15th time.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded this and it worked for the first few weeks,  and then i would click on it and it wouldn't  open. Nice app,  but it has bugs.
0060531053|5.0|Everything you need to learn all the basics of homebrewing. Either all grain or extract brewing is discussed there. You will learn all the basic techniques with a touch of humor. There is also many proposed recipe in the book. When I started brewing my first IPA came from that book!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I'm sorry that I waited so long to read this book. This book was recommended to me by several people, but I was hesitant to read it. It is simply one of the best pieces of fiction I have read in a very long time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product has offered great entertainment for our daughter. It keeps her occupied positively. She enjoys it very much...but only for a limited amount of time.
0345803485|1.0|This is just a more pornographic Harlequin Romance. Characters are shallow and underdeveloped. Story line is weak. I am amazed that this has gotten so popular. Don't waste your time.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|I agree with other reviews I've seen on the CD. None of the tracks are especially groundbreaking, but if you like Satriani then you'll definitely want to buy this album.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow wonderful story or is it stories ? I have lost my self in these and when it ends I am desperate to see what is next. This author is on verge of something great. I am sure we will be seeing these tales on screen soon. All I can say is if you like science fiction with characters that become real to you read these and then make your friends read them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not my usual type of book but thought I'd give it a try because of all the hype. Was not disappointed, an easy read and a fun look at how the other half lives. Looking forward to book two!
B005K8H8W0|5.0|Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese dream (2011) 2 LP 180g Set<br /><br />\\"Fiercely adventurious, brooding and expressive, \\"Siamese Dream\\" is a breathtaking ride into a majestic rock world all its own. Inventive and enticing, this is a modern classic\\" is the perfect way to describe this excellent and very much groundbreaking album!<br /><br />  Siamese Dream was the second album by hard alt-rockers The Smashing Pumpkins and remains one of the finest alternative rock albums of all time.  This album a very dense and highly well constructed with layers of atmospheres and deep musicanship.  I actually find this album borders on art rock and prog rock without overt allusions.  Songs like \\"Soma\\" would trick proggers into thinking it was Porcupine Tree.<br />  Although only their second album the band were already at a crossroad with tons of inner friction in the ranks.  This edge carried over onto this album and you can feel the tension and power within.<br /><br />I love the addition of the mellotron on some of the songs and the heavy fuzzed out guitar work of Billy Corgan and James Iha.<br /><br />No question this is a very special album and an absolute must have recording!

B0077EBWVI|4.0|Sweet story line. Good music and dancing without making it a complete musical. I think there could have been more of an incorporation of the back story and gymnastics of the main character to strengthen the character.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Own all four series, waiting for the fifth series.  It is nice to see the series without commercials, and in order.
B00CW665VI|5.0|So let me start by saying I never wrote a review before but I could not help my self with this one!!! It was one of the funniest, romantic books I read in a long time!!! It is all told by the male's pov and I just loved it!!!!
B00CZ5WOQ6|5.0|Now one of my favorites, but not for the squeamish. It's better than the average crime show, obviously, since it's loosely based off of the books.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is an amazing movie! A story of hardship. Of trials of mind, body and spirit. Of love, hate and fear. Of overcoming our worst fears and learning who we really are. Would you survive? A must see movie and it will change your life.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Bought as a gift for someone so can't really tell how it was.  I'm sure the person who gets it will enjoy.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Tried multiple times to find cities of 75k+. No luck. Weak. 1 weather us way better and gives more info.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|This one was bought as a gift for someone.  She enjoys all the previous series and I'm sure will love this one.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|At first I did not like this book and wondered what the fuss was about, but by the end I loved it.  Adam Johnson really knows how to tell a story- all the places his main character goes adds up to the incredible last section.  I know very little about North Korea and thought Johnson had to be making up a lot of the horrible things that happen to Jun Do and the other characters, but the end notes reveal that Johnson went to North Korea and did years of research when writing the novel.  The North Koreans' behavior is like something in an American parody about communism, so it is hard to believe.  One of the saddest parts (out of all the sad and horrible parts) is the relationship of an &#34;enforcer&#34; and his parents; government in the bones of families.<br />This was a clever, smart, innovative book, with a satisfying plot and lots of interesting information.  It was great.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I enjoy this game, I play daily.  It is very good when travelling, no need to carry pencils and puzzle books.  It shows your errors and you can make corrections without erasing.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I am shocked at how fun this game is. I had no games on my Galaxy but then put this on.  Now I am officially hooked.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|A fun game for young and old.  Both myself (a retired chemist) and my five year old granddaughter enjoy this game.
B008ROGQAE|4.0|I seen it on the prime  and I never seen this movie so I thought I watch the movie. I like it a lot.  I thought it was interesting  and how things began to go wrong.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Fast moving game with good graphics.....fun to play and very challenging.  I think it would be better on a larger screen, somewhat difficult on the Kindle.
B000QJLQY4|4.0|Funny and to the point reading. I enjoyed it. Anyone wanting to start a Business, this is the book to read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I do not normally like this kind of thing, zombies, etc. but I love this show.  You can always expect the unexpected.  When you watch most shows, you know what is going to happen in the end because the main characters cannot die.  Well, you never know what is going to happen.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. Its great for kids but also challenging enough for adults. I like that you can set the number of pieces. There are some really great pictures available as well.
B00APYUPB0|5.0|The quality is great, I would recommend it highly. I would suggest other IQ works as well. You may like Michael Olefield as well if you like IQ.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I like this game. My son loves to play it as well. I also like the different versions. I have this game on my iPhone as well.
0307959856|3.0|After a while the charm wears off and all that remains is the boring.<br />Did these people really think and live like this?<br />The book goes off in all sorts of tangents and the murder itself is really not that interesting and neither are the people.<br />Nice writing though. Like eating a sugar free ice cream.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|There were so many finger prints on the disc that it wouldn't play. It was taped a in shrink wrap but it had been handled prior to sending it out. After cleaning it played. I thought I was paying for a new copy.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this all the time, I have it on My Apple lap top, Iphone, PC and now my new galaxy s4. Really great app!!!!!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Loved this book...could hardly put it down...finished it in one day. There are many lessons as take aways from this book.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci's character Will Robie (sniper) is put in a situation where his moral ethics are challenged and cause him to be set up in this thrilling novel. Lots of underhanded political machinations going on and Robie is caught up right with it. Highly recommend this book for those of you who enjoy military/political intrigue. Won't be disappointed! Will definitely continue reading his next Robie installment with &#34;The Hit&#34;.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|For years, I've looked for a great way to display photos - books, websites, prints, etc.  This is the best!  It's simple to upload even large photos to the Cloud Drive and then to view them almost instantly on my Kindle.  I guess it's something about the backlighting on the Kindle that makes them glow, but whatever it is, they look gorgeous!
B0051GOB26|5.0|Dude, the BEST Cult movie ever, do you need this limited edition.<br />Yeah, well.. wou know, that's just like, uh... my opinion man.<br /><br />Shipped faster than expected and plays without problems in Holland region.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an amazing game they uprgraded it from the first one a lot I recamemd it its very addictive
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|The 25th anniversary reissue of Green continues the successful series of R.E.M. remasters. Assuming that everyone already has an opinion about the strengths and weaknesses of the original album, the main arguments for buying a reissue come down to whether the sound is really improved over the original release and whether the bonus material is compelling. I wondered whether the sound really would be improved in this reissue, considering that Green was the first big budget album that R.E.M. did with Warner Brothers. While the improvements in the sound are incremental and perhaps less obvious than with the first albums in the series, there is still a real difference. I noticed this mostly in the clarity and balance of the ensemble, so that the different instruments and Stipe's vocals sound more natural--with almost more of a live quality--than previously.<br /><br />But the main reason to buy this set is the live concert, which proves that--whatever you think about the evolution of R.E.M.'s music--the quality of their live performances continued to improve. The Greensboro concert features excellent sound quality together with a passionate performance and technical sharpness. There are many highlights here including a torrid \\"Turn You Inside Out,\\" which Stipe sings through a megaphone, \\"The One I Love,\\" and a taut \\"You Are the Everything.\\" Perhaps most surprising is an early rendition of \\"Low,\\" which will show up later on \\"Out of Time.\\" This live edition, however, has a relentless, slow building of tension that isn't present on the album version and stands out as one of the gems of the concert. All in all, the Green reissue is a nice addition for R.E.M. fans. Now the long wait begins for the \\"Out of Time\\" 25th anniversary disc!
B000AP04NI|5.0|I had seen this movie years ago and loved it. Did not have a copy and since I live in Oklahoma...well...just had to have it. I have to watch it by myself. My husband doesn't like musicals..lol
1616550414|5.0|This book is beautiful, full of amazing amount of detail.<br />If you're like me, you like to peer into the mind of the creators of such magistic work.<br /><br />This book does just that, with sketches including notes made by the artist such as, &#34;For the feathers, the tiling should be inversed to give it a more heavenly look.&#34; or &#34;His feathers should always be falling to make him appear malting&#34;<br /><br />Things like that - show you how much attention was paid to each nuance, and how each and every detail was placed for a reason.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie precedes &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; movies...we really liked it. I think you would like it if you liked Lord of the Rings
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use a calculator often, and this one is user-friendly! Nice big numbers, easy on the eyes, and definitely easy on the pocket-book ... a free app!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Wasn't sure we would like this movie but saw it advertised on TV. I'm really glad I purchased it. It was really good. My husband even liked it and he is an action movie buff
B00AAQWJCG|5.0|Had the CD earlier, lost it. Thanx to amazon mp3, I can listen to this whenever. Frank Zappa 's first foray into jazzy fusion tinged instrumental  music, a must for music lovers
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Games should always load if there is nothing wrong with your device!!<br />Sorry to say but it just dosent work!I know it is fun because I've played it on my friends tablet but now all my friends including me have had trouble with your game! So now o have completely uhh wasted my money!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This set is well worth reading. Exceptional stories. If you saw the movie and hadn't read the books, you will be pleasantly surprised, I think. The books are far and away better than the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book plays with your emotions. I found  myself literally sobbing by the end. The writing  is so eloquent. John Green deserves every bit of praise he gets. I hope he finds a way to make adorable evolutionary advantaged puppy sized elephants.
B000FA675C|5.0|Well worth reading! I found it very hard to put the book down even for a short while and it didn't disappoint.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|I really enjoyed the action in the movie, but when I look at the movie as a whole, it was a letdown. They seem to have concentrated so much on the action that they didn't take the time to develop a solid story. I realize this is all comic book fiction, but I still expect a certain level of realism in a super hero movie where I don't have to turn my brain completely off. Good action, poor story.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Well worth reading; for your self as a child, YA or adult. Or just reading it to your own children and thereby getting to read it yourself.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|I like it  but would prefer better graphics, it's free however so...I guess that's why it looks the way it does.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Responsive, good features, and best of all it merges all your Google Reader Rss feeds effortlessly.  Just what I need.
B004M9AS3Y|4.0|Pros:<br />This bag rocks if you just want a DSLR and an extra lens, a few accessories and a laptop for the day. It's perfect if you're just walking or riding around for the day. Not as much a nerdy camera bag. I love the front zip pocket for small items and the side pocket for water bottle or point & shoot. the handle built into the straps is really nice. Fits a laptop and even has an ipad pocket in front of that which also can fit a book or magazine.<br />It's nice if you're going to a cafe with your laptop but always want a dslr ready do grab.<br />The back has a slip skin so it can fit onto the handles of most rolling carts but if the bag is full it's a tight fit.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I'd often have to take a bunch of stuff out to access certain items which gets frustrating. I also found it a bit frustrating when I overpacked it with filters, memory cards, card readers, a small tripod head, flash, laptop, portable hard drives and extra batteries.<br />The main thing I wish it had was a reversed camera zip pocket as I like to sling it around off my right shoulder for quick camera access so I got a Chrome Niko Pack but that's a totally different kind of bag. It's more rugged, a lot larger but holds a fair amount of more gear which is easily accessible.<br />If you like to roll the bag down your left shoulder for quick access and want a simple looking camera bag that holds a decent amount of gear then go for it.
0380730405|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat until the end. This is a love story with suspense. I highly recommend it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Our favorite time with our DVD is Downton Abbey Marathon Night!  Gather together some friends, popcorn, a beverage, and enjoy great drama!
B001QB9ETK|5.0|A fantastic film. I've wanted to be a Jesuit ever since. And the score is amazing! So moving. A must see for the religious and the non-religious.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I was given the chance to watch this at a recent brony convention and needless to say I was quite blown away by the dark undertones that this film showed. At the same time, I was absolutely impressed by the quality of the animation and the overall story's relevance to modern day issues we face including child abuse, terrorism, and inner-city poverty, topics rather unexpected within the context of the show. Of course, this is definitely not for children due to its rating, but that does not detract from it being a true masterpiece to add to your film collection.<br /><br />It became clear within the first ten minutes that the R-rating was well-deserved. Without spoiling too much, I did not expect the filmmakers to kill off Rarity and Rainbow Dash even before the title shot, nor did I expect the realistic references to the recent Boston Marathon bombings (this took place during the Wonderbolts Derby, approx. 10 years after Season 3). When the Royal Guards were waterboarding Fluttershy, I honestly cried my eyes out, and as it was, well, there's a reason they call it \\"My Little Pony: Fall\\".<br /><br />I did not initially understand the comments and reviews concerning the Nazi references in the film until I watched it; now I knew Queen Chrysalis was quite evil from her appearance at the Season 2 finale but I never expected her to be THAT despicable until she murdered the princesses and took over Equestria within a fortnight. Just... wow. I later found out on numerous forums that this project was months in the making and was meant to make up for the dismal PR backlash that Hasbro has found itself in as of late within the brony community.<br /><br />The character development shown in this film is quite unexpected; I found myself being able to relate to Twilight Sparkle even more now and their take on her persecution under the Chrysalic Regime due to her autism was something to ponder long after the film. In fact, when the credits rolled, there was complete silence in the auditorium for a minute before everybody began excitedly talking to one another in heated discussion over what they just saw.<br /><br />I think that dhx media really outdid themselves this time and I have Daniel Ingram's soundtrack for this film on my iPod along with other greats like Hans Zimmer and Zack Hemsey. I will definitely preorder this and overall, I think that if you initially choose to eschew this film for its seemingly sappy MLP material, I assure you that you are truly missing out on a work of art for the modern age.
0553208845|5.0|Inspiring, soulful, and maybe life changing.  Read it you may just  thick twice how you deal with life on earth.

6302642248|1.0|Purchased this video for my home child care program.  Picture quality fuzzy and lined, voices were dragging.  Children were very disappointed.  I would not buy from this seller again.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Love the movie. Love the subtle messages throughout the movie. It is great for open minded deep thinkers. Love the imagery.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|Watch this movie at the theater. Thought the movie is stupid. But just can't help myself when it went on sale on black friday. It's one of those movie that just bad but the graphics is so good, you just have to say &#34;what the hell&#34;.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|Its plastic, and more plastic. It is very light light weight. Just not what I was expecting. I was hoping for it to have some &#34;realism&#34; to it. For the price, I figured they could break out some metal and weigh it down. Its not very impressive. Sort of embarrassed to own this childish thing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of those movie that I can watch over and over and over again. There's not much to say that others haven't already said. Just a fun action movie.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|My Junos Pulse AV is constantly detecting that this APK contains a.ginmaster.21 trojan... Uninstalled.. Also sent feedback to Amazon regarding app.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Woody Harrelson is so funny and Emma Stone is so hot. I'm so ready for the zombie apocalypse. Enough said. HAHA.
159463176X|5.0|I adore novels that bring multiple stories through different characters together, linking decades and destinies.  Hosseini not only accomplishes this device exceptionally well, his beautiful prose adds a whole other dimension to the overall story.  Two Afghani siblings, a fiercely devoted older brother and a darling toddler sister are separated by unusual circumstances in the 1950's.  We are given glimpses of their divergent lives through a variety of other narrators in various locations. From a humble chauffer in Kabul, to a Greek doctor doing aide work in war-torn Afghanistan, from Paris to California, it reflects the climate of Afghanistan as a nation and how it has affected its citizens throughout the years.<br /><br />This book is an eloquent demonstration of how things come full circle.  There are tragedies and triumphs, and they are offered with unparalleled elegance.  I was so moved by all of the individual narratives and was amazed at how perfectly they all came together.
B002JIEYL2|5.0|The musical act that began metal hit it on the button here! Anyone who has not heard much of or any Sabbath should start with this album.  It's an amazing ride...
B003IWRE3I|5.0|I showed this to my class of high school juniors for their elective on Apocalyptic literature after reading the novel.  It was fantastic quality, easy to pick up where we left off each day.  Also, just a spectacular film.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Too drawn out and we never find the truth out about Jacob. The way the story unfolded during trial was interesting but we never got to see Jacobs point of view... but I guess that's why it's titled Defending Jacob. Borrow it
B0014CDKVY|4.0|I showed this to my class of high school juniors for their elective on apocalyptic literature.  The quality was great, and it was easy to pick up right where I left off each day.  I wish the alternate ending had been included though.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|It is not up to standard nor one of his better stories. Not the most believable and I expected more
0060594896|5.0|I love this book, its giving me some great ideas that I plan to put into action. Wonderfully written. Would definitely recommend this book.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This was one of the most interesting movies I have ever watched.  I could watch this movie over and over.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I like Sophie Kinsella, so I never even thought to read the other reviews before buying Wedding Night, but that turned out to be a mistake.  While the book wasn't so bad that I put it down before finishing it, I really thought it was pretty stupid and mean spirited.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I enjoyed The Hobbit movie and the rest of the set immensely.  I also enjoyed the set of books that go along with this movie. .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank goodness these five books were packaged together because I could not stop reading.  Characters were very well developed and showed both the best and worst of humanity.  The storyline may be post apocalyptic, but this is a very well written, exciting, human story that would appeal to readers of many genres.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing It turns out that the game is just like the pics. Your allowed to build anything you  want ( my opinion)<br />I THINK THAT YOU LIKE THE GAME AS MUCH AS I DO.

B0041OT9W6|5.0|Anne was an amazing writer.<br />It's so sad when she talks about wanting to be a journalist and author, when the reader knows she's gonna die!<br />I wonder if any of her other stories were saved, like about Cady or Ellen the Faerie?<br />Maybe she wrote another diary at concentration camp?<br />Though she probably didn't if they haven't found it by now.
B008602KQI|3.0|Good movie that stayed close to the book plot. I'm looking forward to the sequels.  Had to watch in SD because I don't have an \\"approved\\" HD device.
B00BWDJILG|5.0|Redman, Melhldau, Granadier and Blade had made a \\"classic\\" album, with strings. Incredible arrangements for strings of Dan Coleman . Redman play clear and beautiful versions of some standard, from Kern and Hammerstein to Lennon and McCartney. Is a peacefull CD. Is music for any moments, great music but is\\" pure music\\" to hear with attention because is not a easy listening music, is not bland, is essential, in some way minimal .  Six! tracks with orchestra and 6 in quartet . Joshua Redman play more classic than ever, under the fantastic production  of Brad Meldhau. Granadier play great, Blade  the same and Mehldau is there, always in the back, perfect. Great album that sure you will hear thousands of times .Usually the albums of tenor saxophones and strings  are bland, but not this, this is a new classic.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this in 2 days, the book kept me interested into what would happen next.<br />  I would recommend this book before the movie.

B007RCJNDE|5.0|A wonderful end to a story that is  as vast as a karoo landscape. The kind of end that lingers with you long after the book has ended.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Started this read on the beach of Kauai and couldn't put it down. Later, and with much anticipation, I read Gone Girl.  [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]  I think Dark Places is the better read.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Or so the Judy Davis character says in Woody Allen's masterpiece \\"Husbands and Wives.\\"<br /><br />In Before Sunset, the lives of Jesse and Celine are collapsing, a bit, and they turn to each other apparently out of desperation. If things had been going hunky-dory would they have ended up hooking up with each other? This film seems to imply that this is not the case.  In Before Sunrise, the first installment of this series, they are strongly drawn to each other out of mutual interest in one another, strong physical attraction, and, apparently, love.  But in this installment, the second installment, am I to believe that they end up back together out of...desperation...to escape all of the b.s. that is going on in their lives?  I'm not sure.  It seems to me the film could be read this way. If this is the case, then I'm not rooting for them to get together in the same way that I was rooting for them to get together in the first installment.<br /><br />Now what should I be expecting for the third installment (Before Midnight)? Should I be expecting that Jesse and Celine will realize that they had not hooked up in Paris for the right reasons and that they've made a terrible mistake? Before Midnight opens up where I live within the next two or three weeks, so I shall soon see.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />By the way, I loved this installment just as much or more than the first installment.  Just wished to hell it wasn't so short in length (75 minutes, subtracting out the final credits).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
030758836X|3.0|Gillian Flynn is a great writer, and I looked forward to reading this book, but I liked Dark Places better [[ASIN:0307341577 Dark Places: A Novel]].  Thought this was a little over the top, and 1/2 way through the book I was reading just to get to the end rather than because I enjoyed it.  I do want to read Sharp Objects, so I hope my dissatisfaction is with this book specifically and not with her writing style in general.
B00002E224|5.0|If you think this movie is about young love* you'll be surprised to find that there is no rock-and-roll and/or hip-hop musical soundtrack**.  And you'll be surprised to find that the dialogue does not contain, for example, any debates over what the protaganists' (Jesse and Celine) favorite MTV video is***.  The dialogue is much broader in scope, i.e., it's about...life. Jesse and Celine could be in their mid-40's, rather than their mid-20's, as they are in the movie. The dialogue is broad enough and interesting enough and sophisticated enough to appeal to people of all ages. Most of the time the dialogue is not generation-specific.<br /><br />*Not that there's anything wrong with movies about young love.  I've seen some terrific movies about young love.<br /><br />**Not that there's anything wrong with rock-and-roll or hip-hop. I love rock and rap. And some of my favorite movies of<br />  all-time have rock and rap musical soundtracks.<br /><br />***Not that this is what your typical 20-somethings talk about. This wasn't a good example. My point is, the dialogue in<br />  the movie, for the most part, is not generation-specific.
193700788X|1.0|The title of my review pretty much sums up my over-all feelings on this literary abortion. Reading this made me wonder if the writer even tried. I can tell you this much I'm never reading a Charlene Harris book again because apparently when she's bringing a story to a close she has the need to defecate all over the story and it's fans. I hope you enjoy the 5 minutes of fame you got from what started as a great book Harris.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This movie is excellent for all ages and is a classic. This is the first of two movies and did not fail its billing. I would causion young children that there is much vilolence in this movie and may be scary for most. The movie was shipped to my house as advertised and was well packaged. Opening the package was easy. Everything about this experience was great. I love Amazon's service and recommend buying anything from Amazon, you will not be disappointed.

B007I1TFK0|5.0|The only USA DVD edition of this great Webber musical was in non-anamorphic format.  This will be a treat for all who wished this film could have been seen as it was meant to be seen in its 9 X 16 aspect ratio.  This Blu-ray transfer is very well done for both sight and sound.

B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Great family film and especially good in 3D.  Children viewing this film should be old enough to understand good and evil.  It could be frightening to very young children.  The animation is first class.  The character North might be troublesome to some people.  St. Nick with tattoos on his arms.  One arm says, &#34;Naughty&#34; and the other says, &#34;Nice.&#34;
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie is excellent for all ages and is a classic. This movie has been done several times with different performers and in this case, the cast selected was excellent.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|The movie version of Life of Pi is directed by Ang Lee and includes quite a lot of computer graphics. It looks good in 3D and is well acted. Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan deserve a special mention as the young and adult Pi. Gerard Depardieu plays a small but significant role. Adil Hussain and Tabu are excellent as Pi's parents. The screenplay is fairly true to the book, but there is a romance element that has obviously been added, Hollywood style, and is completely unnecessary. There is a scene in the ship's dining room which, while not in the book, obviously serves as a device to give background for the alternative story by introducing the sailor who breaks his leg, and the cook. I was sorry the scene with the priest, the imam and the pandit was omitted. While the CGI and 3D effects were brilliant, I felt the storm/sinking ship scenes asked the viewer to suspend disbelief a little too much: how did Pi manage to get back to the lifeboat from so far away in the high seas? I was glad I had recently reread the book so I was completely familiar with it, and I feel the movie kept the overall spirit and feel of the book. Would I watch it again? Definitely! Would I recommend seeing it in 3D? Absolutely!
193700788X|1.0|I have not read a Sookie Stackhouse novel since Dead and Gone, so there may be those who feel I do not have a right to give an opinion, however, since I HAD been a devoted reader of these books since they started coming out (yes that means before True Blood was even thought of) I feel I must speak out.<br /><br />When I started reading the books, I became an instant fan of Harris' work.  I thought her writing was unique, engaging and brought her characters to life in a way that I had not seen in a long time.  I loved Sookie's spunk, attitude and her strength which could have stood as an inspiration to women who were not as outspoken.  Harris also managed to create a world that I was envious of, meaning that after living in the world of vampires, werewolves, shifters and fairies, it made normal, day-to-day life just boring.  LOL.<br /><br />When the series came out, I knew from seeing Alan Ball's previous work that he was going to take the reins and create his own little twist, which I was prepared for.  He got it right with some things, especially the casting choices, although I initially did not envision Anna Paquin as the Sookie character, nonetheless, she pulled it off wonderfully.<br /><br />Having said all of that, here is why I did not continue reading, after Dead and Gone.  Sometimes, when books come to life and become popular, it gives the artist/writer a bit of an arrogance that they can twist and conform the vision into anything they want.  The idea of having so many people hanging on to see what you will produce next, can sometimes result in having a 'mightier than thou' attitude.  I guess it would feel powerful to have so many people devoted to something that you have created, knowing you have carte blanche do what whatever you wish.  I believe this is what happened to this series and there were signs of this after D&G which is why I discontinued reading the books.<br /><br />With regard to the show, notwithstanding my previous compliment, overall Alan Ball took a series that people loved and mutilated it.  Fans had become frustrated and pissed off.  Why?  Here's a clue: the reason why fans watched the show were because of the books, so wouldn't it make sense to put your own flavor into it while keeping the linear storyline true to the books?  With regard to the books, here's another clue:  the reason WHY people continued reading the books is because 3/4 of the fans, which means literally millions of people, wanted to see Sookie with Eric.  It was like a big, fat, sloppy slap in the face to the fans when this obviously did not happen.  I get that a true artist has his/her own vision and goes with that despite the pleading from others.  But my question is, why is it a bad thing to give the people what they want?  Surely, a true artist is capable of doing that while encompassing your own ideas and visions.  That clearly has not been the case in either the books or television.<br /><br />I have come to the conclusion, thanks to other fans and their honesty in the reviews, that I was clearly correct in my initial assessment after reading Dead and Gone.  I saved my money and did not have to endure the pain of reading what was once greatness into C list drivel.  The author should have taken a page from the writers from Fanfiction because those 'amateurs'  were able to get it right.
B001U0HBPG|1.0|If you like character studies buy it the CD was great quality and as advertized, the movie however sucked.Not the sellers fault.

B000TU16GS|5.0|One of the very best books I have ever read I really enjoyed it and I recommend it to everyone
1439127727|4.0|One of the finest books I have read on the relationships of former Presidents and those that served after them.  The interesting aspect of how then sitting President Harry S. Truman recruited former disgraced and ignored President Herbert Hoover to essentially help the Truman administration, behind the scenes, develop what would be The Marshall Plan was by itself fascinating. Or how then former President Eisenhower was being actively recruited while in retirement not long after President Kennedy was elected but who made many mistakes early on.  Eisenhower clearly was fascinating by himself but how he along with Truman, Johnson all connected and stayed connected was fascinating.  The other portion of the book I enjoyed, since I have been to the Nixon Library and seen many of the letters, is the correspondence between former President Nixon and then sitting President Clinton who relied heavily on Nixon's insights and advice.  Carter, more than anyone else seems to come across as a bitter loose cannon which is also fascinating.  This was a gift at Christmas and I read it in 27 days, could not put it down and nor will you if you are interested in how these many through President Obama work behind the scenes since, as former President G W Bush said, we all must support our Presidents.

B00AO7HQ06|5.0|I have been a fan of the Allman brothers since college.  There is magic in what Duane and the various bands he worked with brought to a song.  The genesis of that magic could best be understood by someone who took the time to truly listen, knew of the roots and then brought forth a collection that not only honored his work, but was crafted in a way that pulled it all together.  Skydog does that and so much more.  I learned where Duane's 'ear' for dual guitars came from, his love and respect of the blues and his willingness to bust tradition in pursuit of a sound that was uniquely his.  This collection is truly an act of love, imbued with an artists' touch that is presented more as a journey of discovery that the listener is invited to take than homage to a father whose life was way too short.<br /><br />Listen well and you will understand what Ken Burns was saying in his videography on jazz.  Duane was and is a unique American artist who understood his roots, revered the power of the art and was not afraid to transform it.  We are all blessed that his daughter took the time to let us in to a place where she likely goes often.

B004LWZWBU|3.0|It's what's known as a comedy of manners. It's a form of entertainment which makes fun of the affectations, habits, values and manners of our times through characters familiar to us in our encounters with them like an old person pretending to be young, the career executive, or the playboy. The plot usually revolves around a scandal but in this case, The Big Year deals with a project that gets out of hand. The characters lose sight of the priorities in their lives, struggle to recover them or discover new ones. The plot is less important than the witty dialogue between them. At their best they can satirize the hypocrisy and pretension in society. Unlike the unbeaten Miami Dolphins who can do nothing but wait until every team has suffered a loss before they can toast that their record is safe for another year, Kenny Bostick can actually do something about it. He spent an entire year of his life setting a record number of sightings. Now sane folk know that records are meant to be broken but it means so much to Bostick's self esteem that he can't allow it to be broken by anybody but himself. It's really an exercise in vanity by all three characters except the other two still bear a sense of responsibility to the people around them. In the end one discovers his next wife while the other re-discovers his family when they learn that there are more important things in their life than a big year and birds. The acting is fine. Beautiful photography. The writing is weak and the script loses focus. One guy will throw his life away. It's the job of the other two characters to learn why he's so reckless. Learn why they would never do it themselves but can hardly lecture him themselves when their own behavior leaves much to be desired. It had potential. I liked it. But it lacks punch and misses too many points about our times. Where's the dialogue? There's an extended version with another 40 minutes. Was it cut away for a shorter fast-paced film? Simply not worth the time?? Don't know. It's a shame that this film was lost but cinema like the theatre demands good writing.know.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|most of the sound loops do not recognizably repeat - contrary to what some other reviewers state. And Ive been an audio director and sound desiger before, so I'm guessing my ears are decently accurate There are a plethora of sound loops and most are wonderful. While I agree that vacuum cleaner or lawn mower are not relaxing or useful ambient sound loops, those number 3 out of like 30 loops. And besides, they've got a cat purring loop and the tapping of rain on the roof of a car youre sitting in loop. These guys know what is relaxing. You rock, developers!

B009XIXVU6|4.0|After waiting with baited breath for Khaled Hosseini's latest book,  I finished reading it in two days. I cannot say I enjoyed it as much as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, but Hosseini is a remarkable story teller and his characters are always so honest and flawed that it is often hard to believe they are made up. Through his characters Hosseinis admits to thoughts and emotions we would be ashamed to admit we ever shared but so often do. He does not pander to the reader's desire for a happy ending, choosing instead to have the characters live with the consequences of their thoughts and actions. Husseni leaves his characters flaws and wounds raw and exposed, allowing for a personal connection to stories that so intricately weave together fact and fiction. A high recommend and cannot wait for his next work
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love this game, but for the THIRD time in the last week the tournament had an error and I got NO credit...it was my best score ever and they only offer to reimburse what you spent....which is nothing on the daily tournament except for a ton of power-ups. Randomly picked of course but I had 82 and 47 were only 2xp...not so random, as I have complained about before. Also, Don't call BINGO so quickly, if at all, you actually get less! Just lost over 1,500 points...not feeling so great about this game right now...
B005DN7W4G|5.0|One of the best of the best when it comes to end of the world movies. Much better than Armageddon.
B002KCO6QA|1.0|When I tried to play the DVD of Moon, All I got was a message 'REGION ERROR'.  The DVD cost $ 8.02 plus $ 2.98 Shipping and Handling.  I returned it at a cost of $ 4.65.  So far I paid $ 15.65 for a DVD that did not work and I am waiting on the refund.  I will write more when I get next months credit card statement.  I will try to buy the movie again but not from MOVIE MARS.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|Awesome app, i love how cool this idea is.  I'm not entirely sure when i'll actually use it, but it's cool having it be there when and if i need it. Recommended for all
B00CRS88IO|3.0|Premised upon the idea that the James bond of cinematic fame is actually based upon the Second World War experiences of Bond author Ian Fleming, the book presents an action-packed alternative reading of the WWII that pits Fleming, our ersatz Bond stand-in, against everyone's favorite baddies - the Nazis. It's a fun, short read that aptly captures the spirit of James Bond, but is somewhat flawed in its presentation of the era's technology and historical detail. Still, despite that it's worth a read and should provide more than enough entertainment to get you through a long plane ride. If you like how the post-war Bond dispatches SMERSH agents with a quip and a judo chop, you'll love Fleming doing the same to the Fuehrer's finest.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you liked the series you will love the book. Adds the back ground and details that make the tv series more understandable.

0061564893|2.0|In 1421: The Year China Discovered America, retired Royal Navy officer and amateur historian Gavin Menzies makes the claim that the Chinese \\"discovered\\" America, nearly 70 years before the arrival of Columbus. Not only did they \\"discover\\" the Americas, in Menzies's estimation, they also established settlements and impacted the local population and ecology of the Americas, in a before now unknown \\"Ming Exchange.\\" Though Nordic fishing expeditions have been acknowledged off the coast of North America, Chinese colonization of the Americas prior to Europeans is a bold claim. When I saw this book on the shelf at a local used bookstore, I wondered how it could possibly true and not be the most earth shattering discovery of our time. As it turns out, the narrative reads briskly, but a hundred pages in, I felt even the most naive reader should be suspicious.<br /><br />I will say, Menzies's book is not entirely worthless. For one, his life experience as a sailor and his knowledge of sea navigation is a useful jumping off point for inquiry, I guess. I wonder how many academic historians are as learned in navigation as Menzies purports to be. Such knowledge certainly would complement historical studies of early modern voyages, including those made by Chinese vessels. This book's other use, however, should be as a teaching tool for critically evaluating historical arguments. Menzies's constant claims to have found \\"conclusive,\\" \\"indisputable\\" evidence makes the whole affair seem like a great cover-up, when in fact effective history is rarely narrated in such a bombastic way.  Historians provide interpretations that build upon and are refined by earlier and later interpretations, based on documented sources and solid reasoning. Much of his indisputable evidence is highly contentious and speculative, at best. His claim that roosters \\"crow\\" differently around the world (versus linguistic and cultural differences that render animal sounds differently) is absurd. His list of evidence in the book's appendices is often esoteric (Navajo elders knew Chinese? Come again?) and his treatment of indigenous peoples is unreconstructed (the people of Tierra de Fuego are described as huddling around fires in an uninhabitable wilderness...except, of course, they inhabited it, and were doing just fine until the Europeans came along. Sorry, I mean, the Chinese.) His global sleuthing produces apparently authoritative answers, such as his deciphering of mysterious stones found in Cabo Verde, though lack of citations at key moments leads the reader to believe that most of the evidence is in fact fantastical speculation.<br /><br />Ironically, rethinking China in the early modern period is a rich area of historical inquiry, one that scholars have only recently begun to carry out in a wider global context. It is here where Menzies's amateur designation becomes apparent. China may have ceased exploration in the mid-15th century, but the Ming dynasty was far from isolated from the global economy. The fact that in the first few chapters Menzies rehashes the old argument of Chinese isolation after the mid-15th century is an early warning bell. Only in recent decades have economic historians begun to understand the extent to which China's demand for American (that is New World) silver influenced the global economy. China, meanwhile, provided luxury goods and spices to Europe and the Americas. No nation of Europe could claim true economic dominance until the rise of industrial capitalism in nineteenth century Britain. I refer those interested in finding out more to the works of Kenneth Pomeranz and the late Andre Gunder Frank. I think Menzies ultimately hopes to de-center (though I'm sure he wouldn't use that term) Europe within the age of exploration and beyond, though the manner in which he does it here is tone deaf in regards to his knowledge of actual scholarship in the area. Bizarre but perhaps not surprising that the Chinese government would bestow academic accolades on such a researcher, considering that more serious investigation remains to be done on China's historical role in trade and the global economy.<br /><br />There is the question of that map that kicks off the goose chase. I don't know, maybe it's just a red herring? Early modern European \\"armchair explorers\\" certainly speculated a great deal on what lay across the Atlantic and in exotic other lands. There's no reason why his original piece of evidence doesn't reflect this type of fantasy on the part of its author. I don't think the question will keep me up at night, though. Menzies makes a (well deserved) passing swipe at a speculative forebear, Chariot of the Gods, a bizarre book that argued (among other claims) for aliens having made the Nazca lines.. Despite Menzies's obvious enthusiasm, 1421 resembles most this predecessor: it also deserves to be read skeptically and picked apart before being donated back to the used book store from whence it was purchased.lades on such a researcher, considering that more serious investigation remains to be done on China's historical role in trade and the global economy.<br /><br />There is the question of that map that kicks off the goose chase.

B004FDPOHC|3.0|I am not a fan of the band and the movie was just awful,<br />but I remembered that I liked the music a lot.<br />I don't know if the Amazon version is different from the movie but I just didn't find it as exciting.<br /><br />I do play it every once in a while,<br />but this will definitely change once I have more music in my phone.
B008GGA5EQ|4.0|I've read the 'Fifty Shades' books and other so-called erotica titles and I must say that Chloe Thurlow's books, of which 'Girl Trade' is probably my favorite, are the best examples of this kind of writing. A story needs to transcend the trappings of its genre to be taken seriously and 'Girl Trade' succeeds in doing so by being a thriller-like adventure as well as delivering all the goods you'd expect from such a tale. Thurlow knows how to write powerful sex scenes by showing everything through the eyes of a compelling character that the reader is rooting for. Her unadorned prose is highly effective at putting you in the moment and she knows how to set up a scene for maximum arousal. The sex in 'Fifty Shades' feels tame and almost silly in comparison. Immature, yes, that is the word. According to Audre Lorde \\"The erotic offers a well of replenishing and provocative force to the woman who does not fear its revelation, nor succumb to the belief that sensation is enough.\\" In other words, if done right, erotica can be empowering. 'Fifty Shades' tries to achieve that effect but it isn't convincing. It takes a very skilled writer to persuade us that a woman who becomes a sex slave feels empowered. But that's exactly what happens in \\"Girl Trade\\" and it works because Chloe Thurlow is such a clever and talented writer who goes beyond the surface thrill to get inside the minds of her characters. If you want to read something truly erotic, check out 'Girl Trade' and other books by my new favorite author Chloe Thurlow.
B00CW665VI|5.0|You have got to read this one!!! It's like a breath of fresh air!!!  It is written from the male perspective.  He is actually telling his story and he is honest, funny, witty.  I found myself laughing out loud one minute and dying tears the next.  This book had it all.  It is a realistic love story for the 21st century!!  Drew and Kate are both characters that I fell in love with.  The secondary characters are awesome too! Go read &#34;Tangled&#34;  Give it a chance.  It's not getting these fabulous reviews for nothing.
B00000251N|5.0|The only thing wrong here is that I could ONLY give a five star rating for this. I'd have given it more if I could. I first &#34;met&#34; Jonathan Livingston Seagull over twenty years ago but from that first encounter, I was hooked. I've never stopped flying since he taught me the things I needed to know, all those years ago. I have the book, DVD and CD (even got the old vinyl LP lying around too lol :P). This is a tale of an ordinary seagull who strives for perfection, knowing there is more to life than just going along with what the rest of the flock are doing, It speaks to you on deeper levels than you might even be aware of, at first. It merits a second and even a third reading of the book and, having read the book, when you hear the music, you are instantly transported back. Once you see the dvd, the seed is planted within your heart, the spark is ignited in your soul and, despite yourself, there is no going back. Ever. I cannot rate this highly enough and I recommend it to absolutely everyone. I hope others enjoy it as much as I have.
B00BB22GSU|5.0|This band... I feel like I haven't connected to an album like this in a long long time. I am overjoyed to own it on vinyl, and I have probably listened to it through more than 12 times in the last week or so (digital and analog). Album of the year for me; really incredible. I wish I had time to write comprehensive review but you'll just have to trust me on this one.
B00000DFSK|4.0|I came to U2 latterly and only recently discovered who Bono was but the wait has been worth it and the delay, through my ignorance, is just one regret I will have to live with. As with many artists, I don't like all of U2's productions but there are maybe four or five tracks on here that I love, which makes the purchase worthwhile, I think. Just don't listen to some of them with the volume turned up too loud, especially when you're driving!

B002HFP0QU|5.0|Back to the days of Disco? I've always loved the Bee Gees, ever since I first heard them on the original version of 'Saturday Night Fever', even though I didn't know who they were then. Once I did, I became an avid listener of their music ever since. This two CD set has all the classic hits here, the ones that fill your heart with love and nostalgia for what has gone but it is something not to be missed. Bee Gee fans will love it of course and those who are still to discover their sound, a magical journey awaits.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book, filled with betrayal, excitement, and rejoice. Reading this book brings back memoriesof my old dog and made me happy. Out of the million books I've read before this book, this wonder, is the best thing I've ever read. My favorite thing about this book is that at the beginning of the book I cried about 30 times, but by the end I felt so happy for the main character, Auggie, that I felt I was one of his friends, congratulating him when he did something good. Helping him when he was hurt or offended. I really feel this is the definition of \\"beautiful writing.\\" I feel that everyone in the world should read this, and this whole review is coming from a twelve year old. Wonder what adults and writers would feel... just wonder.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a nice &amp; relaxing game.  Children would have fun with it,too.  It's informative ,entertaining, and easy to play.  The only drawback is it's too hard to get pearls.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|It's been awhile since I've read a book that has entertained me right from the start and this book definitely kept me reading, sometimes way too late! This story travelled to so many places and times that it kept me thinking about it even during the times when I wasn't reading. I found myself wishing it was longer and it was a good sized novel. I would definitely recommend this book  to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in a good story.

0618918248|5.0|Saying this book has changed my life is kind of an understatement.  I grew up Mormon and was practicing till I was 19 or so it has been a year since.  My parents raised me well and as a very accepting person so I have no qualms with them I love them and they have always been accepting of me and I blame them for nothing more than trying to raise me in the best way the believed, but I have always been an outcast in my own religion because of my views on different things, my acceptance of homosexuals and other groups individuals and my love and acceptance of science.  This was very hard on me and I now realized was one of my main sources of depression and anxiety.  Before reading this book I was in a very bad place and extremely depressed I was having a crisis of faith between what I had always known to be true (science and hard facts) and what I was raised and pressured to believe in (God and religion).  It is sad to say but because of some health issues that I will always have to live with and the mounting depression that I was feeling I had felt abandoned by god and like I was being punished for something I had not done.  I believe that if I had stayed that way I may have tried to commit suicide.  This book has helped me out of my depression and resolved some things that I had never knew existed by removing the hooks that religion had placed in me.<br /><br />I thank the author for removing the dust and cobwebs from my mind that have been building up after years of religious closed mindedness and upbringing and allowing me to find joy in my love of science again

034554398X|1.0|The jokes on me of course cause I continued reading but jeez, after 3000 or so pages you'd think Martin would've written at least one poetic sentence or jape worth smirking at. Tyrion's a \\"genius\\" who never says anything profound, Jaime and Brienne just call each other names, Sansa is nothing but sad and afraid, Catelyn and Robb tediously discuss different marriage arrangements, the Wildlings are \\"free\\" but cant do anything except follow orders and pound their heads against the wall, Bran has dreams,and Hodor says \\"Hodor.\\" Hey ser Davos, are you still weary of Melisandre? Wow nice to see that hasn't changed in the last 2000 pages since it was introduced in the prologue of book 2. We had only one scene of incest this time around so perhaps that's progress?<br />Listen, obviously this isn't for me and if it works for you, it works for you.

And you'll be happy to hear of my blunder, bought Wool 1-5 each, separate and then the omnibus, so you got six books bought out of me and I'm glad. You are an amazing writer Hugh and I am so glad to have found your books!! What a compelling story and loving, strong characters!! Keep up the amazing work and seriously...start demanding more money for a job well done. A man has to eat you know!! If men don't eat, there is usually very unhappy people around him.

B00BAVCD8A|3.0|This album does not sound like the usual fall out boy that people have come to expect. Lyrically, it is still somewhat clever but their sound is completely different. This album is more electronic; there is more experimentation and sampling. Also the fact that there are a number of songs featuring other arists is kind of annoying. I miss the old fall out boy sound!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|City of Bones is an excellent read.  It has a few turns that I didn't expect and I am ready to start reading the next book in the series.
B003B02PEU|4.0|When I read the other reviews, oddly I have to agree more with the points made by the negative reviewers. However, when I read a book, I'm just looking for a good story. John Grisham always delivers on a good story. He has a tendency to ramble sometimes, but I actually like that. It relaxes me. His ending have a tendency to leave me wanting, but this one had an ending - good or bad is up to you.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is an absolutely amazing book written from the point of view of Death itself.  It was quite interesting to read a story from the point of view of a German during Hitler's reign in Berlin, Germany.  I felt like I came to know each character in this chilling story!

B009NPA3MS|5.0|Phillip Phillips makes music that is so real and so ageless. It is as if he was born on that stage. His music and the feeling that comes through it are so far beyond his young age. I love this album, and I am very happy to have the chance to listen to him. Thanks to all his hard work and authenticity, and thanks to American Idol for giving him a way to get here. Stevie Nicks was right about him - he is going to go far (I was Phillips' age when she was with Fleetwood Mac). He was my favorite from day one - I've never had a complete knowledge from start to finish about who I wanted to win - I usually go back and forth all season long. But not on his season - it was Phillip Phillips all the way. His music and his stage presence just moves me. What a talent!

0399165274|5.0|The Preacher is a Muslim extremist who preaches jihad and assassination on the internet and whose face and name have never been revealed.  The Tracker is a US Marine officer with an unofficial US agency.  His mission is to identify, find, and kill the Preacher, the latest addition to the White House's \\"Kill List\\".<br /><br />The story begins slowly for the Tracker who searches to find anything about the Preacher's identity as one assassination after another is committed by Preacher recruits, Muslims who suddenly change character and each one, acting alone, kills some American or British official.  And one of the attacks suddenly makes the issue personal for the Tracker.<br /><br />The Tracker begins making some progress in spite of Pakistan's secret service, Israeli mistrust, Al Qaeda purity police, White House restrictions on his methods, and even Somali pirates.  Along the way, we learn about a dozen different US defense and intelligence organizations, a dozen famous terrorist attacks, and seamless connections to the Tracker, officers, and agents involved in the search.  Oh, the Tracker does have some help from a teen hacker afraid to leave the attic in his parent's house.<br /><br />As the Tracker begins to home in on the Preacher, two complications severely limit his options and impose a serious time limit on finishing the job before the Preacher can disappear again.<br /><br />Most readers will be able to put the book down once in a while as a past terrorist attack is being described.  But each reader should be careful not to start the second half of the book without having several spare hours available.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|I am enjoying this book. I read it on the plane using my Kindle App during my recent vacation. This is a terrific combination of all his writings.
B000001ZS8|5.0|Brentano's, 1984.<br /><br />Up by the ceiling was a shelf full of brand new CD's. There was a row of covers facing out. Looking down on me was one I had never seen before. A new Jarre album! It would be another year before I bought a CD player, so I bought the record instead. Even though I owned `Souvenir of China', nothing could have prepared me for \\"Zoolook\\".<br /><br />It starts off slow and mysterious, like elephants on a dark savanna. Then come vocals. Strange vocals from a variety of voices that make no sense. This is world music before they called it world music. This is the new cosmopolitan Jarre.<br /><br />Four minutes into `Ethnicolor' the sound swells up, making you think something dramatic is going to happen. Instead it settles down again into a conversation of mixed languages. This album is definitely different. Then the monkeys show up. And everything breaks loose as we hear keyboards, bass and drums go nuts with the voices. It sounds like Jarre actually has a band on this album.<br /><br />`Diva' was something I never thought he would do. Though it is done in the same style as the first track, slow mystery first, rocking part second, that second part blooms into a full on *normal song*. One from another planet that is.<br /><br />The original `Zoolookologie' on the other hand is just outright weird. It's like the monkeys are in the city now, and jamming in the bar. This record version is not easy to find anymore, replaced by a much less zany CD version. It was biz zar oh moon dough for sure.<br /><br />Back breaking, sweaty and harsh, `Wooloomooloo' is \\"Temple Of Doom\\" all the way. `Zoolook' is the party song. The CD version is more of a pop mix than the original, but well done bouncy fast and crazy.<br /><br />`Blah-Blah Caf&eacute;' is the drinking song. One of the easiest here to swallow, it is the real bar song. Something they might play on Fiji or Tatoonie. This and the last track might be the only ones accessible to many who hear this album.<br /><br />`Ethnicolor II' sounds like it should be the true end of \\"Magnetic Fields'. It fits that album perfectly. It sounds like we are in the station again, mixing with the people between trains. Maybe Jarre wanted to bring us back to reality at the end so we would not wander too far astray, so he tied it all back together with a nod to his earlier albums. It is a relaxing end to a dramatic album. \\"Zoolook\\" is a radical new cosmopolitan approach, and one that should not be missed.r />`Ethnicolor II' sounds like it should be the true end of \\"Magnetic Fields'.

B0083Z614S|5.0|I had not read this book since my children were young and I read it to them. It was fun reading it again.
B000001ZS5|5.0|Summer, 1981.<br /><br />I can still remember standing on a street corner happily holding the new Jean Michel Jarre record. This was the first new release of his since I had bought his first two records in 1978 and I was so looking forward to it. But upon hearing it I was totally put off. This was not the smooth sounds of his prior work, this was radically fast keyboards spewing out streams of notes. The second and last tracks sounded like something the guy at the mall would be playing while trying to lure customers into the piano store.<br /><br />I returned the record, saying it was scratched, and the clerk promptly gave me another one just like it to take home. Sorry he said, but you cannot return something just because you do not like it. Usually you could get away with this by saying there were no more copies available, but not this time.<br /><br />So back home I went and onto the turntable the new copy went and guess what... I started getting hooked. I quickly grew to love this new super quick Jarre sound. It was flamboyant and rash, but it was also technical and note perfect. This music was amped and addictive. There were parts where exterior sounds could be heard, like voices and trains. This new effect gave the album an added dimension.<br /><br />The 17 minute opening track dominates the album but almost seems like 3 different pieces, due to the way it changes during the middle section. I then jump to track 3 which starts with the train going by. My friends back yard was right next to a foot bridge that went over the railroad tracks. We would go up on it at night, get high while listening to this album on tape, and then wait for the train to come flying under us. The sound was much like what you hear on the album, although we would get the shakes and the wind with it. An awesome musical rush to say the least.<br /><br />If this had first appeared as a CD instead of an album with separated sides, track 3 and 4 would have probably come next, as they fit together much better. The third track reminds me of someone playing percussion on bamboo sticks in water. Maybe at that point Jarre already had thoughts of playing in China.<br /><br />Track 4 has such a classic touch to it before it takes us into the train station itself. Though \\"Zoolook\\" was so shocking at the time [we never heard \\"Music For Supermarkets\\"] it is now easy to see how natural songs like `Blah-Blah Caf&eacute;' and 'Ethnicolor II' fit after the fourth track of \\"Magnetic Fields\\".<br /><br />I play track 2 last. It actually sounds better on the live albums when played as a standalone song. Despite the fact that the last cut still belongs in the mall, this became one of my most played records, and my top Jarre album until \\"Rendez-vous\\" came out 5 years later.ether much better.

B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|The movie felt like they were trying to recreate the Matrix only with a worse script. They had some brilliant one liners but the most interesting story (the one with Asian Keanu Reeves) was lost among the visual philosophy class. Its not worth the rental price but if you're that curious and have  2.5 hours to waste go for gold. I also did not enjoy Halle Berry. In my opinion (of which I'm entitled) she cannot act well. A film like this demands more Hugo Weaving's and I'm afraid she wasn't up to the challenge.<br /><br />Also the script was quite boring. I kept trying to focus but found myself breaking often. Even near the end I went out to the grocery store and came back determined to watch what I paid for. This film really does not capture one's attention. Even the philosophy jars the mind with contradictions. One truth yet you blend multiple philosophies? With contradictions like that who can really focus? I could go on but I will say something positive as I don't want my drop of rain causing a nasty ripple in time negatively effecting my future selves. (movie joke... lol) I did LOVE the visuals and action sequences (reminded me of the Matrix). I really think they should stick to action or pure sci-fi. Maybe let someone else write next time? Maybe one philosophy? (Judeo-Christian worked for the matrix :p)
B000001ZS3|5.0|Huntington Beach, 1978.<br /><br />There was a music store down the street and looking in the side windows you could see a row of albums. The two albums that stood out above all others were the one with the Earth as a skulls head, and the one next to it, the one with row after row of walrus's looking at you.<br /><br />Investigating these I found that one was brand new and that the skull was two years old. And they were both made up of all synthesizer music. I was very into Yes at the time and very much into oil painting. I thought this type of music might be just the thing to create art with. So I took a chance on the skull.<br /><br />I was immediately caught up in its technologically sophisticated yet loopy rubber band sound, which seems to be what makes it so catchy. It is cold sounding, yet upbeat, like frozen bubbles reaching toward the warmer surface waters. The sound is so smooth, the way it shifts between slow beats and fast beats is so normal you almost don't realize it has happened. Silky sound threads just slide through the air effortlessly. This album influenced many an artist, but though it may now be considered chill, there is no drone here at all, no real trance, just waves. Cool refreshing waves of sound. You could almost call it ambient in that it creates its own ambience, but this is music with melody, not just sound. And the beats all seem organic, percussive maybe, but not drums. That would come later, in concert, for live effect.<br /><br />This recording is liquid in every way. There are no sharp edges. This is an electronics album which knows no boundaries and encompasses all within its spell because it is so undefined. It's just free to flow. It starts with a translucent bubbly effect and, calm and scenic, it ends with waves and seagulls at the beach. Never once is your mood altered or removed from this dreamy world.<br /><br />Oxygene creates an atmosphere which you can hear, one that breathes in and out, throughout its length and breadth. This music is at once cool and digestible, like plastic that you can eat. I immediately went back and bought the walrus album, which turned out to be its twin sister. If all you need to breath is music, \\"Oxygene\\" will keep you alive.This music is at once cool and digestible, like plastic that you can eat.

0062071017|4.0|The Strategist by Cynthia Montgomery challenges readers to ask \\"Am I a strategist?\\" and goes on to provide illustrated examples and insights into the skills and sensibilities all senior leaders must possess in order to guide their organization to ongoing growth and success. Cynthia presents the lessons learned from leading executives while teaching at the Harvard Business School. Within her book, Cynthia covers topics including:<br /><br />- Strategy & Leadership<br />- Are you a strategist?<br />- The Myth of the Super-Manager<br />- Begin with Purpose<br />- Turn Purpose into Reality<br />- Own Your Strategy<br />- Keep It Vibrant<br />- The Essential Strategist<br /><br />Why You Should Read This Book<br /><br />I like The Strategist for its insights to a key skill every successful executive possesses. Cynthia brings readers a vast collection of experiences from hundreds of senior corporate leaders and well researched case history. Her concepts come to life through a myriad of detailed case studies like those the Harvard Business School is known for.<br /><br />If I had one criticism of The Strategist it would be that the book is too academic, lacking the real-world insights only an author who has `been there' can provide.<br /><br />The Strategist conveys to readers the key skills and thought processes they need to succeed as organization leaders. It challenges the conventional, tactical thinking so many managers get locked into. For its executive-level insights and illustrative examples to the critical challenges faced by all organization leaders, The Strategist is a StrategyDriven recommended read.<br /><br />All the Best,<br />Nathan Ives<br />StrategyDriven Principal
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My son keeps dragging me to these Marvel Comic movies and I love them.  Just watched the latest Iron Man at the theater, with Stark commenting repeatedly on still being traumatized from the New York incident...aka, this movie.  So, had to get it to watch again..and again, no doubt.  I'm approaching 60, and never was much of a comic reader, but definitely enjoy these films...so guess having kids is good for something :)
B001NE80P4|4.0|If you've seen the first two High School Musical movies, you can guess the plot of this one.  Lots of dancing and singing and breaking up and getting back together at the end.  Typical.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|So, not a guarantee that I'll love the new movies.  However, my son just took me to see the second Trek movie of this series, which I enjoyed thoroughly.  It made me realize that I needed to go back and watch the first one again since I haven't seen it since it was in the theaters.  I will enjoy watching this periodically as I do with all things Trek.

B00BYISQTO|5.0|I'm going to keep it simple.<br /><br />The vocals are the first thing to give this band their character. Just the way Matt sings gives me hope for the serious and critical view of our world. The ways he delivers the words in these songs are so simple and elegant. I'm not going to get into interpretation as it'll be different for all of us, but meanings abound.<br /><br />The instrumentals really set the mood and lay down a beautiful canvas for Matt to sing on. One song to listen to that immediately aroused pleasure is \\"I need my girl.\\" So sweet and up lifting in the sense that he captures an intimate relationship we can relate to.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm surprise, this might be my favorite album from them.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|same like bad piggies its awesome a challenge and every child would want to play it took a while for me to play it still dont know how to play it well and every child should love it. there is no doubt that children give up on it
B004I2K4E8|5.0|We got to see this same basic cast in London, with Nick Jonas as Marius, in 2010.  Although we LOVE the 10th Anniversary Edition, as well as the movie version with Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, this is another very well-done show, and is definitely worth having.  It is fun to see the show with different actors from time to time.  Some of these performers do as well or better than those on the other versions.  And the return of the previous Jean Valjeans -- including Colm Wilkinson -- at the end is neat as well.  Love it!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game it is so fun. I love the racing that  is the best part in my opinion<br />Except I wish it was not 50000 Dragon coins whatever you call em other than that<br />It's a solid five stars
1591843790|3.0|Kawasaki's book left me with a bittersweet taste, on one hand, it delivers exactly what it says, how to enchant people on various levels. On the other, it shows very little that can't be found on other books. What's the point? What separates this book from the rest? Well the cover is very nice, and of course Guy's expertise with both small and big businesses puts him ahead of others.<br /><br />The book starts out a bit boring, most of its content is common knowledge. Halfway through the book, I was tempted to put it down and move on. But honestly, I'm glad I didn't since the ''enchantment'' can be found in the last 40 pages. Therein lied those little gems of wisdom that someone like Guy can deliver.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a solid 3.5
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Loved this movie the first time I saw it with my family. My mother had been wanting it for the longest time. She's kind of obsessed with it. :P So I purchased it for her for Mother's Day and she was pleasantly surprised. Can't wait to see RED 2 this Summer with my boyfriend. Its one of his birthday presents. :)
B007FC3AAI|4.0|The movie is great and I watch it all the time.  I just wish I had ordered the 2- disc version like I have with all the rest.  I guess I'll have to give this one away and order a 2-disc version.
193700788X|4.0|I don't have much to say about this story except that I was satisfied with the conclusion. Even though I have been avoiding other reviews for fear of spoilers, I have heard enough to know that there are a variety of opinions about the way Charlaine Harris chose to end her series. I thought that she kept the story true to Sookie's character.<br /><br />I liked seeing some favorite characters and some villains make a reappearance in this story. I felt satisfied with where those characters were. I was glad to see Mr. Cataliades and Diantha play a major role in this story. I really liked getting a chance to catch up with Quinn too. A brief appearance by Alcide let us catch up on his life too.<br /><br />I thought that the part of the story that dealt with Sookie's relationship with Eric ended up the only way it could given both Sookie's and Eric's characters. It gave Sookie a good chance to demonstrate her resilience and show that, despite all that happened to her through the series, she was still a good Southern girl. \\"Steel magnolia\\" wouldn't be a bad description for her.<br /><br />Throughout the series Sookie lost a lot of the innocence that she began the series with. Each new type of supernatural and each new thing she learned about her own heritage rubbed off some of the innocence but left a much stronger person.<br /><br />Read it and then go back and savor the whole series again. That is what I plan to do.

B00005K3O4|5.0|Are you afraid of clowns?<br /><br />No shame if you are. There's something inherently creepy about clowns -- their exaggerated facepaint, their artificial merriment, their resemblance to Tim Curry. Any people with coulrophobia may want to avoid \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\" -- but everybody else will probably find this steadfastly, straight-faced comedy about grotesque, monstrous alien clowns absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />A mysterious object crashes near a small California town. When Mike Tobacco (Grant Cramer) and his girlfriend Debbie Stone (Suzanne Snyder) investigate, they find a circus tent filled with popcorn-based weapons and cotton-candy cocoons filled with captive humans.  Obviously they know this sounds crazy, but Debbie believes her ex-boyfriend Dave Hanson (John Allen Nelson) will believe them.<br /><br />Dave (who is a cop) understandably is a little skeptical about the whole murderous alien clowns thing, but soon the Klowns are on a full-on rampage through the town -- think popcorn guns, pizza delivery, corpse puppetry and cream pies laced with acid. Dave, Mike and Debbie may be the only chance to stop these vile alien invaders... well, with the help of a pair of slackers in an ice cream truck.<br /><br />\\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\" is a... truly fascinating movie. It has a premise that is so blindingly stupid that it becomes awesome, and it plays that premise COMPLETELY STRAIGHT. In fact, it handles the entire premise with the utmost seriousness, which only highlights the sheer ludicrousness of the whole idea of evil alien clowns and the goofy ways they kill people.<br /><br />In fact, the most entertaining parts of the movie are when the movie just busts out the most bizarre, silly methods of murder EVER. It's pure cotton candy (non-cocoon variety) for the brain: the gloriously cheesy dialogue (\\"Nobody's gonna put me in a balloon again\\") and hammy acting are just over-the-top enough to be funny, but not to the point of being irritating.<br /><br />I also suspect that the characters are intended to be parodies of many horror movie characters, particularly the violent thug cop and the love triangle. The actors all do a pretty good job, and it's a credit to them that they are able to sound so earnest and serious when they're... well, trying to free people from giant balloons or cotton-candy cocoons. How can they keep a straight face?<br /><br />But the show is ultimately stolen by the Klowns -- they are grotesquely over-the-top, with glistening fangs set in enormous maws, grotesquely misshapen bodies and dead soulless eyes. They are gloriously absurd AND scary... until they become absurd again.<br /><br />It's a stupid premise handled without a single ounce of goofiness, which is part of what makes \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\" such a wondrously funny movie. Fun, weird and not for coulrophobics!r /><br />I also suspect that the characters are intended to be parodies of many horror movie characters, particularly the violent thug cop and the love triangle.
