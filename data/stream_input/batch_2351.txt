B004GCPJDQ|4.0|It takes a little longer to re-charge than I expected, but other than that It works as advertised &#34;Great&#34;.<br />Saves having to replace batteries all the time.
B00005K9LM|5.0|This is Judas Priest's best work. The interplay between KK Downing and Glenn Tipton, the slashing vocals of Rob Halford, and the sheer brute strength of the songs are worth buying this CD. However, there's a bunch of soft acoustic ballad crap from the seller on this, and while he's not bad, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR CRAP ON THE END OF THE HARDEST METAL ALBUM EVER.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I have a terrible addiction to pinterest. now that it is portable the addiction has intensified ten fold. I'm positive it is what I use my kindle most for. It makes crafting cooking and pregnancy research so so easy! I have so many boards it is insane. It has changed the way I research. I have never been addicted to a website or app until now. I LOVE IT!!!
B000002LFZ|5.0|All their best. Awesome memories. Fleetwood Mac Stevie Nicks Mick Fleetwood Lindsay Buckingham good tunes got laid to them in 86
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is extremely well constructed. The main characters are easy to like or dislike as the case may be. Hugh Howey has a great knack for developing suspense and keeping you there. Looking forward to the next 3 books. As soon as I finish this review, I'm buying them.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This makes me think quickly.  I use it while watching TV.  Gives me something to do other than stare at the screen of the TV.  I recommend it to anybody that likes a challenge.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun very addicting.  I highly recommend this game for all of you who read<br />this. Warning watch out for trained LOL
B004RQVVGU|5.0|I wasn't expecting anything except the CD that made Ozzy and Randy superstars in their own right, but I would have paid 5 times the price for the live Blizzard of Ozz CD featuring RR at his most smokin'.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A witty, poignant, in your face star crossed love story...Spoiler alert: the story its based on mirrors the actual story.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|If I was forced to choose a favorite movie of all time, this would very likely be the one.  Schindler's List was masterfully directed by Steven Spielberg (all his movies following this one are average at best, to put it mildly!).  Schindler's List was directed with METICULOUS detail and acted superbly.  Cinematographer Kaminsky's black and white photography is some of the finest I have ever seen (up there with Fellini's La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2--which I consider to be some of the most gorgeous B&W movies ever!).  While difficult to watch at times (heart-rending and disturbing), the simple story of a compassionate man (Oskar Schindler), saving a discriminated people from Nazi persecution, is a stark reminder of how we must NEVER repeat the past and why we must continue to push forward for a more civilized society.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I spend lots of money to buy exercise dvd but this dvd sure worth all the cash!! 20 minutes with jillian it's like hours in a gym :)) I'm not targeting myself to loss weight in a month, but for sure will use this dvd for my daily exercise.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have a weird daily schedule and this app on my kindle fire HD keeps me alerted when I get involved in other projects...
B000002UUH|5.0|This Collection has most of the best songs I rmember when I once had many of his early vinyls, that have disappeared. Obviously, &#34;Imagine&#34; is perhaps his all-time best. Many others like &#34;Love&#34;, &#34;Instant Karma&#34; the loud &#34;Cold Turkey&#34; , &#34;Love&#34;, &#34;Watching the Wheels&#34;, &#34;Woman&#34;, and many otrhers here are all top songs. And finally can listen to &#34;Dream #9&#34; anytime; plus &#34;Mind Games!&#34; Would have liked &#34;God&#34;, & &#34;Working Class Hero&#34;, two of his most controversial numbers, from his first solo album, but I can manage without them for now!.This CD is a 5-star no-brainer! Plus the lyrics are enclosed as well!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A very good read. Held my interest to the last paragraph. If  you are a parent, you feel the inner turmoil of Jacob's parents. The gnawing truth on many levels about your child is sobering.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|interesting take on Kerman's prison visit.  She def complained a lot meanwhile she totally deserved to be there. If you are curious about women's prison - read this book lol
B000MCIBAW|4.0|I bought this when it came out ,way back in 1967. I thought it their best, and that afterward they steadily declined with pop stuff like \\"Hello I Love You\\",etc. The album cover is interesting, and fits the \\"Strangeness\\" which seems to be the theme for this, their 2nd album. So \\"Strange Days\\" with its eerie organ, and \\"People are Strange\\", with its beer hall style piano, are perhaps the two best songs here, and still hold up. \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\", a guitar and vocal near-virtuoso performance not bad either.\\"You're Lost...\\" quite a nice ballad; \\"Horse Latitudes\\", which is hard to listen to straight through, is apparently a Morrison shout-fest about, well maybe that's anyone's guess. \\"Can't see your Face\\", a trippy ballad not unlike my favorite Doors ballad \\"Crystal Ship\\" on their 1st album. \\"When the Music's Over\\" another very long apocalyptic downer, the sibling of \\"The End\\" from the 1st album. The rest passable at best. Perhaps, with a little education and life experience, self-proclaimed weird and trippy songs like some by the Doors loose their appeal. But I still give it a very good rating (4-stars), since like many of the Doors's records, the sound, effects, lyrics, et al are unique to this band, and hold up fairly well after so many years (45- a long time!); not to mention the 5 songs noted which are way above the average pop songs of that or any era!
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Interesting  concept for a story line, but it became too  repetitious , then rather predictable.  Found myself skimming large portions.
B00BF11STU|2.0|This movie was sooooo slow moving. I think I fast forwarded through most of the movie. Bottom line on the movie is...meh
B00B5JBZGS|4.0|I am hopelessly addicted to this album right now.  It is a solid album all around with some of my favorite KSE songs on it.  It marks the return of KSE for me, since their last self titled album really fell by the wayside for me.  I am glad Jesse Leach is back in the band doing vocals and I think this album is a great start for them as a rebirth of the old killswitch team.  With all that said, I personally cannot give this album a 5 star rating, due to the fact that some of the later songs are not as good as the earlier stuff.  Of course this is my opinion and others may disagree.<br /><br />For me, the real standout tracks are  Hell In Me, Beyond The Flames, The New Awakening, All We Have, and many others to closely follow, such as You Don't Bleed For Me and Turning Point.  However songs like In Due Time, No End In Sight and Time Will Not Remain are the low point of the album for me, though still enjoyable.<br /><br />If they can make their next album as good as the best 2/3rds of this album we will have a 5 star on our hands.<br /><br />Regardless of my nitpicking with some songs, I strongly suggest any fan of KSE or similar music check this out!  And if you do get the Special Edition, you will be treated to a very well done live performance of Numbered Days, one of my personal favorite KSE songs.
B005FVNJTS|3.0|I enjoyed the read but in my view suffered by comparison with &#34;OPEN&#34; &  a little too much ball to ball descriptions of some of Rafa's famous Grand Slam Finals
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Fantastic writing!!! And the singing was really great. I was a little skeptical at first but after the first 5 minutes I was sold. It was really good! Rebel Wilson was hilarious!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's great!! It was a free download.  I like to be able to check the weather on my Kindle Fire.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|first off, i love all quentin t. movies!!!!!<br /><br />now, this movie was wonderful. the fact that throughout the movie django was a MAN, made me watch it twice back to back. so worth the money. some people say its nice to see a man in a movie play a complex character, to see all the raw emotional and mental sides of him. well, they do it too much in movies and i believe it takes away from the main male character from being a man. as a woman, i know you have to let a man be a man. men are simple, not complex. so no i don't want to see a man in a movie cry or get all soft over something, when his main goal in the movie is to be the hero, good guy, or \\"THE MAN with a plan who destroyed the whole land on a mission which is grand\\"... you know???<br /><br />so yes i loved this movie. jamie foxx, from start to finish, was a man. he did not complain, he did his job, kept to his word and saved his \\"little troublemaker\\". loved it. i don't think i can say it enough. loved it!!!!!!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE movie. I fast forwarded through 90% of this movie. It was soooo boring and a little too bloody, and it didn't need to be that bloody. And a main character where you never see his face...blahhh
B007712XAU|5.0|Love this series.  I was a late comer and had to have the earlier seasons to catch up.  The costumes and scenery is fabulous.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It's good you can only play 5 hearts at a time or I might play all day...I think it would be nice to be able to buy gold bars with coins you earn in the game instead of real cash....waiting to earn them can take FOREVER! Fun game!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|So the movie as a whole was really good but Russell Crowe was TERRIBLE!!!! Not sure why or how he got cast as one of the main characters but everyone else was really good!
B0000029GA|5.0|I'm a 63 year old white guy, Software Engineer. I could not make it to work without this CD playing in my car. Every morning it sounds fresh and new.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Being a fan of the TV show, I naturally enjoyed  this story.  Though Reich's writing is of the short sentence variety, she is able to create an atmosphere so you feel and can envision the scenes she is trying to convey. How can a young girl keep giving birth and then kill the babies? In this story it was somewhat difficult to keep the characters straight being there were as number of  and as you read on into the story, even the relationship  of siblings is confusing.  Enjoyed the summary at the end and to learn there really are diamonds  to be  found in Canada.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Have not seen the movie. The book is very dark, but intense. Enjoyed it very much. Can't really picture JL or BC playing these roles so I may never see the movie but the book was disturbing but an extremely moving trip.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|This DVD is wonderful.  I can watch it over and over again.  I purchased it for my mother but I watch it more than she does, lol.  The music is so beautiful and captivating.  To really get a treat, you have to see them live if you get a chance.  I've taken my mother to see two of their shows and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. I will plan on seeing them again next time they come to my area.
160459201X|5.0|Life savior...I recommend everyone to read and apply this book. Dr. Murphy has also other book that Zi recommend, but this one should be read first
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I needed a replacement for Google Reader when I decided to give Feedly a try. I love it! Its a lot better than Reader was with great views and easy swiping.
B009H442DG|5.0|I love this CD.  I also like the fact that the procedes go to charities.  It's great to see John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John working together again.
B001I45UFC|5.0|To me, this was the best of the Narnia series that I have read so far..  I plan to keep reading the ones I have in hopes of finding more great reads
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I loved the cd it was wonderful! I was Happy that Boz made this cd. He is always great!  What else can I say!
B00139W3NE|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!!  It leaves you thinking there will be a sequel but it has not come out yet nor is it in production.  I am really hoping they will make a sequel to this or I will be very disappointed.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|satisfactory. impulse purchase. love them on th radio not all songs play on nook hd+ idk why but whatever. bam

B0092MKFIY|5.0|i Really love them when they are on the radio and i love their  music; the band is great, let us hope they keep it up.
B0016CS0IK|5.0|if you like 80's music, somewhat hipster like charm, this is as good as it gets.  I also have [[ASIN:B005HS00NW Hurry Up, We're Dreaming]] which is newer and it was weak (except for midnight city and reunion of course) compared to this.  Almost every song on this cd is great.  Like Nivrana's nevermind and Gatecrasher:Digital Love.. where almost every songs is good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's just different enough from the graphic novel that I never know what's going to happen next. It's so fun to watch!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|If you are a LOTR fan you probably are a Hobbit fan. Jacksons' treatment is as fine as LOTR. The 3D experience is great as it is not overly done but adds to the enjoyment.
B008M721MS|3.0|As a stand alone app, it works great. The problem comes with trying to use the app with headphones with built in mic, like for a phone. The microphone will not work.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The amount of charge that remains in your battery is particularly important for a device that, to be worth owning at all, needs to be mobile and unattached to wires. This vital information is presented clearly, attractively and in superlative detail by this app.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is such a terrific album.  I love it because it has a variety of songs. It also has duets with other singers.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I finished this book in about two days that's how good it was. I loved the writing style and the story about hope and facing reality.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I love this book, the movie did it justice! Wonderful imagery. Great retelling of the novel. Nice cameo of Gerard Depardieu!
B0017HRCQU|5.0|All of the features that were described on the product page were present and the movie was in perfect condition.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|BEST CD EVER! LOVE LUKE BRYAN! He rocks. This cd rocks. Good price. I would recommend to anyone!(: I loved all his songs. Good quality cd for an awesome price!
B005QBBCMI|5.0|Wow. Nicholaus Cage's finest, darkest moment. Well scripted. Great acting all the way around. So gritty, so real. Painful to watch, yet you can't turn away.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|The movie was in perfect condition and is a very movie story of a special child coming to grips with losing his father.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really liked this book. How it manages to be riveting is a mystery, but it grabs you and doesn’t let you go. Since I don’t believe in global warming the premise of a “Poisoned and poisoning world” seems untenable, (to me). I woud certainly pick up the next book written by Hugh Howey and I would recomend WOOL to any of my friends. Darl Brant
0393343405|4.0|The poem \\"On the Nature of Things\\" by Titus Lucretius was saved by one of the more obscure members of history,  Poggio Bracciolini - a scribe to the court of the Pope John XXIII. The book was somewhat of a myth at times and when Poggio discovered it in a remote monastery he realized immediately what he had stumbled upon. Poggio's handwriting and  ability to copy made him one of the more prestigious members of Pope John XXIII and gave him plenty of liberities.  Given what Lucretius had written with \\"On the Nature of Things\\" it is hard to believe the Catholic Church didn't burn Poggio at the stake for just reading it. The Swerve covers not only the investigation of Poggio and his search, but the church's politics  and how everything Lucretius wrote was counter to what the church would allow with its teachings. Very little of the book is devoted to what Lucretius actually said in \\"On the Nature of Things.\\"  What is covered is the politics of the Catholic Church during the Renaissance, and strangely enough, how works by the Greeks and Romans were saved by the Catholic Church. The book really got traction in England during its Renaissance. Michel Montaigne was one of the big proponents of the book and it influenced statesmen like, Thomas Jefferson and  Albert Einstein.  Lucretius was not an atheist, but his views on nature, science and the universe were very much atheistic in nature.  So many were influenced by Lucretius with the scienctific principles of question, observe and experiment.  A book that is an easy read and one of not only history, but church politics. It is a book that shows what a murderous repressive time it was when the Catholic Church ruled.  The Catholic Church might have murdered more people than the Nazis, they just didn't keep as good of records as the Nazis did. Poggio's quest brought an influentical book that ran counter to all of the church's docturines.  Lucretius' poem  is a must read for any atheist. This book has sparked a lot of curiousityin me, not just for \\"On the Nature of Things,\\" but for more of Stephen Greenblatt's work.
B009XTF8JM|5.0|Fantastic story line, I thoroughly enjoyed that this movie did not have to rely on the standard dirty word, every 5 seconds, with no sex scenes!  I highly recommend this movie if you are a horror movie buff like myself!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Nice game and good graphics.  Has great play time it doesn't get boring.<br />Gonna stay with this one. Worth getting!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This is a fantastic music collection.  We keep it to play in the car all the time. My kids know the words now to every song! Loved it!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Reminds me of Galaga, Space Invaders,  and other retro shooters. I like the voxel look and would like to see other genres in this style. FUN!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I haven't read the books and honestly don't plan too but i really enjoyed the movie my kids love it. its an all around good movie. it does deal with some adult theme's murder but its tasteful in its execution doesn't get to gory. A great friday night movie
B007MU85D0|5.0|Really well crafted.  I'm glad I downloaded the entire album.  Such a great addition to my alternative/folk genre.  Want more...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What can I say but that the show is great!!  I'm enjoying each episode, especially the acting of the great Maggie.

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Bowie.  What can I say.  The Chameleon of Rock music strikes again!  Some songs sound like old Bowie, and the others<br />I just call new Bowie music.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I have been looking for good watches at reasonable price with good fashion. I got this from Amazon and I feel that a good value for money. A good look, stylish and good brand. It adds value to my hand and also the time. Will keep you posted. Today is April 10, 2010. Thanks.

B003JUGQ38|5.0|I love most things David Tennant, Dr. Who to not.  Next to the episodes with Martha, this is the best!
B0071MDA2U|5.0|So far I have enjoyed reading this series.  I am now reading the final book of the series.  I would recommend it for junior high age and up.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This has become one of my favorite Disney cartoons of all time! It is great, heart warming and exciting. I loved it!
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I loved this gps watch.  I thought it's the best gift I purchased for myself ever and I have been inspired to run because it helps me track my progress in running.  The only thing I didn't like is, after just a weeks of wearing it--only when I run--the one side of the bracelet where it attaches itself to the watch started to fall apart and now leaves a gap between the watch and the end of the bracelet.  One of these days I am afraid it will completely fall while I am running.<br /><br />I really love the product a lot but because of this issue I am only giving it a 3-star.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|its a very good game and if you like zoo this is a cool game and it's a freeapp also if you help theanimals it is a good thing to teach children responsible actions for animal
B001OQCV2E|1.0|This movie is a disaster of apocalyptic proportions, with a cast of fine actors reduced to falling into a chasm of bad script writing, with more cliches than you can shake a stick at :-).
B0086700CM|4.0|I bought this for my grandson to play with (on my Kindle Fire), but I've become addicted to it. I didn't give it a 5-star rating because sometimes the game seems overly sensitive and will make the character slide instead of jumping.
015626224X|4.0|This strange little story is highly entertaining , especially in short doses. It is a perfect book to carry with you, to read in waiting rooms. I gather it is semi-autobiographical, about George Orwell's early years, starving in Paris in the early 1900's. He has countless weird adventures,with his poverty stricken friends, trying to get together the money to buy,say,a potato so he doesn't starve. They take odd employments, pawn their belongings and meet highly unusual characters who usually scam them in some way. The descriptions of his jobs,for example, as a  dishwasher in a Paris hotel,  are detailed, apalling and funny
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I enjoyed this game completely (played on a Kindle Fire) even though I got it for my grandson. I think this game may be too challenging for some younger players, but he seems to enjoy it. I was disappointed with the low level count to complete which is why I knocked a star off.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|it really works under water.  my daughter took many pictures under water in our recent trip to Puerto Rico completely meets expectations
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I LOVED THIS GAME.  MENTALLY AND VISUALLY CHALLENGING.  COMPLETED ALL LEVELS AND WAS LOOKING FOR MORE.  GREAT GAME WHEN U ARE WAITING TO BE SEEN BY A DOCTOR .
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I bought this as a replacement for the stylus I had originally with my Kindle Fire, and I have been very pleased with it. I like having the choice of a regular or smaller tip, although I haven't yet tried to use the stylus to write with. For my needs the length is just right -- not so long as to be cumbersome nor so short that it's hard to hold. This is an Amazon product designed for the Kindle, and like the rest of the Amazon accessories for the Kindle Fire it's very sturdy and truly useful.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I loved playing it but almost all the time the app would shut down and would never start up. I have this app for kindle fire so if anyone has any suggestions please tell me in these comments. I really love this game and I want it to work sooooooooooooooooo bad! HELP!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I read all the permissions issues. It is 2013 and it is free.  Tradeoff is they mine your data. Nice interface on Fire.  Save articles from many sources to read later. Thanks to blog, now using to store photos, notes for projects. Organized which is a personal struggle.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The graphics are good , but at times some of scenes are too dark to see and it makes it difficult to see. Overall, its a good game to play and its challenging.  It's must for people who like to do puzzles and hidden object games.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a good book! That's coming from someone who doesn't like yo read much. I was laughing then crying. So good!
1476733953|5.0|\\"I'm coming for you. I'm coming home, and I'm coming to clean.\\" Wow, such a good book. It was intense wanting to get to the next page to find out what was going on. Worth any $ you spend.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this only expecting to play for a day, but here I am two weeks later and I'm still looking forward to getting home every day to play it! heck, I'm writing this review so I can get bonus points to get farther in taking care of my horse! :)

B004QX07G4|5.0|Love love love!  This is my first Ellen book, I have watched her show on occasion, but not religiously, and I couldn't praise this book any more.  It is a hilarious read.  I don't think you learn too much details about Ellen and her life that aren't publicly known, but I'm not sure if that's the point of the book anyway.  Ellen definitely has a gift of making people smile and I'm definitely going to look into her other books now.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|Everything Corey Taylor said about HOGAB Prt. 2 is true. Part 2 absolutely has more of a soundtrack flow through all 12 tracks. I don't think Prt. 2 is nearly as heavy as part 1, however it is much darker. The album starts off great with Red City. Red City gives you that dark aspect that the majority of the remaining tracks have. Then you have Blue Smoke and my personal favorite, Conflagration, which has such a great melody and my favorite vocal performance from Taylor. It'll be interesting to see how the two movies play out.<br /><br />What will Stone Sour do next to top off this amazing work of art?
0439023491|5.0|Great quality, came on time, and amazing book. Would definitely recommend to someone else. Keep up the great work. Thanks.

B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Though my opinion should matter to few because of my wacky taste in movies, I felt this was a good film that portrayed the story well yet inaccurate
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My 2 yr old loves growing her own veggies for all the animals.  It keeps her entertained on long car rides and while shopping.
B00AO686MY|5.0|I was so excited to hear Who Framed Roger Rabbit was coming to Blu Ray.  The bonus features are great and is basically a second movie on their own
B0091QSNEE|2.0|Only worked for a week. Now it won't let us open it and requires us to re-download it. What a pain.
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|It took my a little longer than most to fully appreciate this album though I am not a big fan of change.  Dub step works surprisingly well with Korn
1936608898|5.0|What a way to change your life!  The authors take the time to explain to you why the &#34;healthy&#34; foods you are eating keep you fat and feeling badly.  I'm just starting the diet, but I felt like for once a diet made sense to me.  In fact, I don't think of it as a diet at all.  It's a way of living a fullfilling life.
B005QUQP76|2.0|Got his mouse from BestBuy and let me just say, TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE GAMERS. I was so excited to try out the sniper button but ran into so many problems. The software was impossible to find(you have to download it from the link they give u and unzip like 3 files to find the download client), the software stoped working like 100 times(as we speek its not on again and the buttons do nothing)only the basic buttons work. Better off taking your money and getting the m90(same company but better product all around) or finding another brand mouse with that has the button your looking for.
B00BP29SAA|1.0|I have had several problems with this game.  I have to re-download it again.  Pain in the butt.  Not worth it, if this is the quality.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|Saw Mayer Hawthorne on my local PBS station and became an instant fan!  His music is great and he is so fun to listen to.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love games like this that stretch my adult brain in fun ways.  It's fun for my husband and I to compete and see who gets a level quicker.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|I bought this movie because I have read all the James Lee Burke Dave Robicheaux books more than once and am planning on visiting New Iberia in a couple of months. My son suggested I purchase the 2 movies that were made from the books so I could, perhaps, see some of the things I am planning on looking for on the visit.  This movie was quite good and I will watch it again.  However, this was not my idea of what Dave Robicheaux looks like or acts like.  My idea of what he looks like and acts like is much more like an alcoholic (both drunk and sober depending on the book) Christopher Meloni. But the movie is still good.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|AMAZING ALBUM FROM A TRUE LEGEND. Shows you how it truly should be done. My favorite tracks are the one with Dolly Parton (another amazing performer) and Walk A Fine Line. Such a great song and Michael McDonald is one of a kind. Truly a great buy that won't disappoint.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I had great hopes for this movie.  The trailer made it look like it was going to be another epic fantasy film...but they must have only showed all the good parts.  The casting was horrible...i really dont think any of the main characters acted well...everyone seemed awkward and had no chemistry.  James Franco was HORRIBLE....he couldnt quite seem to find a balance between corny and heartfelt...even at the end when he had a change of heart about his whole situation.  I really felt like most of the budget and attention went into the special effects of the film.  I have to say, i was even disappointed in those.  There were elements that really looks good....but many times, the scenary was OBVIOUSLY green screened.  You could plainly see the line from REAL set to GREEN screen background.  The whole middle part of the movie when they were searching for the Wicked Witch was BORING....you'd think there would be some twists and turns in the plot....but not really. Most of that time was spent with the characters traveling through the back CGI scenary having boring conversations.<br /><br />Dont waste your time...it was awful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The characters are appealing.  The story line is different.  I've read them all.  I was glad to have bought them.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|I have always been a Eastwood fan; but it is becoming more difficult to watch him act in his later years.  His voice is going.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The characters are appealing.  The story line is different.  I've read them all.  I was glad to have bought them.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Excellent movie with good surfing scenes. The fact that it is a true story made it more interesting. Watch it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|ONCE UPON A TIME is an amazing show and I  am so glad that I got into watching all the episodes. The cast is awesome and I am surprised by every episode.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's hard to imagine how you would bring off the  finale of a serried like this. Collins does a masterful job. My only complaint--that it's over.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Absolute classic here! The tone and recording quality that they achieved that night is truly incredible and one of the best live performances ever captured on tape. It took a few listens before I realized the greatness. The CD contains extra tracks not available on the original vinyl and they are excellent. It is a questions why this entire concert (deluxe edition including the live Tommy show) has not been released on high quality vinyl. Pete if you are reading, please make this happen soon. I will update my review once I hear all of the disc two live Tommy material.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|It's a fairly nice product. There are way better sharpening systems out there, but not for this price. Still it does okay.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My niece borrowed this book for me. So, everything about it was younger than me. I mean I'm 50+ and this books main characters are high school. I would suggest this book for all. This book made me think how the younger deals with high school, it even has some bullying. It took a turn to the dark horrible side of parental molestation thru the eyes of the child. Very descriptive in her thoughts & fears. Since it helped me understand, it will help you. Thank you author.
0061733199|5.0|This is actually my second purchase of this book, giving the first copy to my son. Very informative. Doesn't leave much out. Well written.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Sometimes confusing but always a challenge so far.  Been playing for about 2 weeks and as long as you aren't a &quot;I've got to find everything right now!&quot;  kind of person and willing to wait a while until your<br /> energy is restored you will enjoy this game.  Always new chalenges but sometimes a bit confusing as to how you should go about solving a challenge.  I plan on continuing the &quot;journey&quot;.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|You cannot believe what a bomb proof knife this is. Strong drop point, 1/4&#34; thick, comes razor sharp, excellent ergos, etc. There's not a better knife out there for this price. Hard to believe they sell these so cheap.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|It took me 3 to 4 different applications to find this calender. I love it, easy to use, edit and access on my kindle fire. Its so simple to use
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app very much! But I wish there was a portal that you could make and that it worked!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|For all ages.  It is funny and not to bad for even young ages.  It had a great and funny ending.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. While it is obvious that there are many different influences in the creation of these works, it is still amazing the way the author ties it all together. In this, the final book of the trilogy, you get to see the toll that the game that has never really ended has taken on Katniss and her 'allies' as they make their final push to overthrow Snow and the capitol. I haven't had a book make me think like this since 'Lord of the Flies,' which I read back in high school (I am 35 now). I know that I will be thinking about many of the ideas stirred in my head long after writing this review. Does war ever really have a good and evil side? Or is it always the lesser of two evils? Learning from history. The corrupting influence of power. The hierarchy of needs. How experiences shape individuals. The human condition. As you might guess, I loved this book mote so than the previous two, and the trilogy in general. I will say, if you are the type to get attached to characters and can't stand when an author kills them off, you may want to skip this series entirely. I personally appreciate the realism, however bittersweet, as in life there are no fairy tale endings.
B003UESJDI|4.0|This film has a good mix of comedy and drama. I think that almost everyone will be able to identify with some character or another in it. Of course, Gemma Arterton looks great as usual. I would probably be giving this 5 stars, but there are points where I feel it does not flow well, perhaps from one too many subplots. Nonetheless, the 4 stars I give it puts it very much in positive territory for me. Certainly recommended for those who like British films.
B003ZK50SY|3.0|Sedaris is a fantastic writer. He is funny, insightful, and observant. His greatest strength is his ability to see the hilarious/tragic in the mundane. This collection of essays was very enjoyable to read. However, Sedaris can also get pretty vulgar at times, and there were a few sections I had to skip over. The reader should be aware of that before reading this book.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book was an excellent, moving story that takes you in to the heart of India.  A must read for anyone!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book, and I loved the movie so excited for catching fire's movie. Awesome book definitely read it is worth it.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Awesome CD!  He has done it again and deserved the Entertainer of the year award.  My kids love it to.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Bought this for my 12yr old daughter and my 15yr old niece. They had rented it a few times but I could not find it in our local stores. Finally checked Amazon and it was on sale! Such a good movie!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Love this time period. And enjoyed the costume and story line. It's a diffently a girly movie. Found the acting very enjoyable.
B000083C49|5.0|Great purchase,  This is my ultimately my favorite movie and I hardly ever see it on satellite.  So glad I was able to purchase this online!!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Loved the story line. Love the actors. Loved the time period. I watch it over and over. A great movie to curl up with a fire and watch.
B007SGM084|5.0|I Loved every single page. I couldn't put it down. I lost sleep many nights getting lost in the story.
0345525558|4.0|This was requested reading for involvement while working with children in crisis.  It was well done in demostrating situations that do, too often, occur.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie was touching.  It was about real people and the challenges they face.  I highly recommend it.  It is for adults..
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like it good way to contact/stay in touch with everyone bothersome that i have to write more unnecessary words
B0015YIGJC|5.0|one of the most awsome cd i own. I listened to this and helped my spanish vocab to be more ....
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Story line moved along and kept my interest in the story.  I enjoyed the book and would try another book by this author.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|At first I didn't like this game at all.  The steering was bad and it took forever to upgrade anything because you don't get very many coins each run and they also don't give enough time. But since I have a broken foot and am very bored and have a lot of time on my hands I figured out that if you upgrade the car (don't buy a new car. Upgrade the one you have) the car handles much better and goes way faster making it easier to get farther in game and get more coins. Once you start to get more coins use them on the upgrades that give you more coins first and then upgrade the others. This makes the game much more fun to play. Hope this helps if you where like me and almost gave up on the game.
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|Okay I can not find the settings at all I looked everywhere but still can't find it otherwise I love the apps by droidveda
B009IJJB8G|5.0|It is good to see shows made every so offten that makes you wonder what twist there gonna throw you and not foreshadow it from the get go, it has been good arks so far but I would like to see some more main story develepment.
B00947N6UG|2.0|I really wonder what was going on in the heads of the Dreamworks people who came up with this thing.  The characters are abrasive (especially the Easter Bunny), the basic story is depressing and it is, overall, a waste of time.  Who thought that having the Easter Bunny, Jack Frost and all the others hack Santa open was a good idea?  There seems to be a trend in the computer-made movies to go for splashy effects rather than story and it seems as though, in every case, the characters dislike each other.  Cartoons used to be fun but not any more. Compare this travesty to \\"Tangled\\", \\"Megamind\\" or \\"Shrek\\" and you will see what I mean.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is fantastic. The writing and acting are superb and I am completely hooked - you definitely want to check this show out!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What I really liked about this book was the unapologetic manner at which Chris described what the war in Iraq was like.  It is a shame that after going through all he did that he was needlessly killed by someone he was trying to help. I look forward to reading his next book when it is released next month.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time.  I prefer to keep my reviews short and sweet and without spoilers so I will not elaborate.  If you love paranormal/fantasy with your romance along with some actual history, then this is the story for you.  Ms. Harkness is a wonderfully smart, brilliant lady and I can't wait to read the rest of this trilogy!
B00BF11STU|5.0|IMO this could be a difficult story to tell because all of the details that lead to the climactic event could be quite dry. However, I think the storytelling is fantastic from a purely cinematic point of view.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a superb story!  I was hooked from the beginning and wanted nothing more than to learn what made Abby and Travis tic.  Although the characters were a bit young for me to relate to, they were mature beyond their years, especially Abby.  My emotions were all over the place while I read.  At times I wanted to take Abby and Travis and sit them in the same room until they realized waht they meant to one another!  It was very frustrating but our reward was in the end when they both got their happy ending!  I loved it!!!  Well done Jamie McGuire!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is a really great app and I think that the angry bird toons are VERY funny.  Hope you enjoy it!!!!!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Preamble: Yep, have every Bowie release either on vinyl or CD. Had a Ziggy/Pinups mullet in '72 at 13 grew up and steadily appreciated every change and one step aheadedness that left the imitators scrambling in the dust and even beat the up and comers to the punch (Steve Strange by a whisker). The assimilator draws influences from the best to make his own. Even Tin Machine beat grunge by a few years. After Reality a ten year break, cooling his jets savouring the second chance living life. Now here is The Next Day. Exploring the modern era of a 66 year old; still producing music with discrete subtle nods to his aural heritage with haunting melancholy touches of the now. Head phones on, lay back on the bean bag with dimmed lights, a large glass of red and be immersed in the looking forward to the big beyond. Embrace the record for even the later works of a master are still worthy of wonder.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This is a fun, challenging mystery game in which the player must find hidden objects  and solve mind bending puzzles. It is enjoyable!
1600597963|5.0|I love this book, the designs are quite gorgeous, girlfriend has it, I wanted it, now I have one too. Yahoo!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|This is a very good movie collection. The quality is very good. Thanks for providing and excellent product. Will recommend to friends.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Movie kept you interested from start to finish, seen it many times loved it just as much each viewing, greatness!
B0079J28NW|5.0|Arrived fast. Great price. This was a gift for my 6 year old nephew. He loves to sit and sing along.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Love it i bet you will to peeps yo i love to read a good book. If you do you will love this series
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a great game, my brother and I do it to each other all the time,<br />My best friend does it to me to. It is a really great game, I highly recommend it.<br />So why are you still reading? Just get it already!! (:
B003K16P3M|5.0|I love this book I can't wait to read the second one . I wonder what happens to bitterblue though
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing!! Probably the best running/parkour. Meh.. Its like what any gamer wants!! I'm a gamer and I'm loving it! Its quite challenging as it gets faster each 1/2 second.
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|I enjoyed the album and in particular there are a couple of very good songs that I like very much. There are also a couple of them that I would just as soon not listen to very often. I really like his voice and the memories involved but country as a whole is becoming too much like rock and the loud electric guitars really turn me off.
B0047685I2|5.0|I love this movie. I already had it, but it was a vhs. It was time to upgrade to a Blu-ray!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is a great little app if you really have time on your hands as it is. quite addictive with lots of bonuses to keep you hooked. The main downside is the poor English instructions meaning you have to guess at strategies.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Drive is a great movie.<br />It is really great to see that Hollywood still makes such good movies.<br />Ryan Gosling's performance is fantastic.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Not your average hidden objects game.  Gives the brain a better workout.  Puzzles and problem solving.  Keep expecting to run into MacGyver!
B0001I561E|5.0|My daughter had wanted this movie for so long.  This movie definitely kept her attention the entire time it was playing.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|very touching and intense loved every minute of it would recommend to all adults not so much children lots of violence
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Nice app for a quick glance at the forecast without all the adds and stuff encountered when going to a website.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I found Downton Abbey to be the best TV series I have seen in a long time.  Even my husband throughly enjoyed it.  We finished the third season over a week ago and it is still with us.  Fantastic series, everyone should watch this one.  Can't hardly wait for season four.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is simple and cute for &quot;kids&quot; and horse lovers of all ages!  The animation of horses is not a strong point in most games but this is one of the best-the horse even changes leads when it changes direction!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really enjoy play this game. works well on kindle fire. enjoy being able to compete with my horse and the option to get more horses is great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Got for my kids but I can't stop playing it :-)<br />Highly addictive and challenging. Makes me still wish I owned my own horse again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read what happens next! I love that this book is more than what I thought it would be!
B009K86D86|5.0|This movie has definitely changed how I eat and how I look at food! If you've watched this and were not phased with what's going on in our nation with our food, you're crazy! A must watch!
B007U1FEQW|5.0|If you are a Beach Boys fan, you have to get this album.  Even if you aren't a fan...get it!  It is a great album.  And it comes in vinyl!  How fun!  I love the Beach Boys!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was in the hospital a great deal as a kid (not cancer but it could kill you).I found the hospital parts of this book amazing for  a work of fiction, they captured the desperation without sounding so sad. I also loved the way he presented characters that were not the perfect trooper who takes it all with a smile. The smiling child with a serious disease is fiction created to make others feel better. The love story was perfect in a Romeo and Juliet kind of way but, it is not parents they are fighting it is cancer. The existential war within these lovers is amazing to read and central to the story. I know I had a very hard period 12-17, didn't we all, but when you think your life is going to be short it is acute. I loved this book for bringing to life the pain that kids should be able to suffer without the pressure to be a perfect spokes people for the disease.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|First book I got on my kindle fire and couldn't put it down. King has outdone himself, this is a must read.
0425252868|5.0|First, I must say I am not a WWII buff by any means, but I have always had an interest in specific stories of the war.  That being said, I read this book for my work book group.  My book group just happens to be at the author's alma mater, Lycoming College, so we felt we had a special connection to the author, with several of the members having worked with the author and his siblings during their college years.  He didn't disappoint me with this book.  I really enjoyed reading it and at times had difficulty putting it down.  As I said to a co-worker, even though I basically knew the ending (I did well in history) I still found myself cheering on the specific characters and hoping for the best.  It was well written and very easy to follow.  The footnotes added extra depth and knowledge.  The added content on the author's website almost brought me to tears to see the main characters in real life.  Such an amazing story!  When I met the author recently, I felt compelled to thank him for not only preserving this story and but all the other special stories and memories of WWII veterans before they are gone.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Sophie Hatter,mThe Elder Sister of three ,is cursed by an evil witch and begins an adventure of magical proportions in order to break the spell. Along the way she meets A talking Fire Demon named Calcifur, A young wizard's apprentice, a very old witch, a castle that is always moving, and the Mysterious Wizard  Howl himself, a man who is said to devour the hearts of young women.<br /><br />An amazing story from the first page to the ending. This is nothing like Miyazaki's movie. This is the original and will put you under its spell.  After you finish it you will want to Reread almost instantly. I recommend it for everyone.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|Not my kind of book. Hard for me to believe so I didn't really like it. Too much religion for me

B0097HSS4M|5.0|I have tried several photo apps, and find that this is the best of them. It has everything I need except the highly detailed tweaking that I would think of doing only on my PC with a big screen and heavy-duty software. This one is easy to use, has a wide range of effects and the ability to rotate and crop to a regular format or manually - the range of things that I often utilise before sharing photos with friends. Thanks to the programmer of this app for a 5-star product.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show of all time!!!! So darn addicting to watch with all it's drama!  Can't wait for season 4 to come out!!
0893815187|5.0|Over the course of the last 30 years, childhood has become something hidden from view of photographers, it would seem. It didn't used to be that way, of course. In the 1970s (and before), photographers were not as frightened of the simple beauty of children. Sally Mann has given that back to us, and more. Her photos show children at play and caught up in their own wonderful world. I look at her work, and I am a child again. This is a beautiful contribution to photography.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|downloaded to kindle or ibooks, not sure which one right now but it worked fine and I enjoyed the book.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The acting was superb, they really brought these historical characters to life.  Some of the torture scenes were a little too real for me but I am an English history nut which is why I chose to watch it. In particular, the actor who portrayed Henry VIII was well chosen for the part, he was phenomenal!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow really good game  but I think there should be another download update still it is awesome and I hope you download it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am afraid to admit this, but I do like this game - you won't be disappointed! Love to play!

B007VUA7VO|4.0|Not that its a required need but it does make it easy to see the more fine aspects of your battery.  If you're one for seeing the condition and wear on your battery then this app will help. (It also looks cool when you're in it)
B0087EVHVW|5.0|The processor is working great, though I haven't attempted to over clock or change any settings from default, it's a heck of a lot faster than the old one.
B005GYGCOI|4.0|For all those who bashed it on Amazon, I have to say that it worked just fine for me.  I had it on Kindle on my Ipad and it was indepensible in my travels in India in the North.<br /><br />Maps of cities are good and allowed me to orient myself before arriving in a new town or city.<br /><br />Recommended restaurants good.  Guest Houses for each town, a bit of a small list and missing many other good ones, but it's difficult to try every guest house.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|It is rare that I find an album that can wrap myself around- particuarly when the album was first released in 1986. But that is my experience in discovering Paul Simon's &#34;Graceland&#34;, albeit twenty-seven years after the fact.<br />In the interest of full disclosure, this album was never part of my collection until a week ago; I remember some of the songs from the radio, and I certainly remember the evening Paul Simon and Ladysmith Black Mambazo brought the studio audience at &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34; to its cheering feet when they premiered &#34;Diamonds In The Soles of Her Shoes&#34;, even before the release of the album.<br />Enter PBS and the documentary on the 25th Anniversary Reunion concert of Paul Simon and the musicians involved in the &#34;Graceland&#34; recording. It was on viewing that film that showed the creative process during the recording of this album and the reunion of those musicians today, that I discovered just how how extraordinary this project was conceptually and musically. It is also the first time I heard all the songs together for the first time as a complete conceptual piece.<br />There has never been an album like &#34;Graceland&#34; before, and probably never will be again; it is a unique once-in a-lifetime meeting of creativity and  genius from the South-African Musicians who composed the music tracks on the spot as this album progressed, as well as Paul Simon who came back to the States with stacks of music tracks and wrote his brilliant lyrics to accompany them.<br />Lyrically, Mr. Simon's songs for &#34;Graceland&#34; are not an evolutionary step from his prior songwriting; his poetic imagery, sometimes sharp and angular (Boy In The Bubble), sometimes soft and soothing (Under African Skies), the restrained irony in the title song, &#34;Graceland&#34;, represent  a quantum leap in maturity and poetic talent beyond anything he had previously composed.<br />&#34;Genius&#34; and &#34;Brilliant&#34; are praises that get passedalong far too many times without proper merit; that is not overstating the case for &#34;Graceland, &#34; a truly unique and remarkable musical experience.<br />I
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I did not read the book which I should have.  Seeing the movie twice, taking in its visuals, meeting Richard Parker and being on that boat was awesome!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have to admit this series is addictive for me.  Great story, wonderful actors, English soap at it 's best.
B001XVP9CY|4.0|The Blade Runner world is dark, damp and very scary!  It really is amazing what we call entertainment; however, I did watch and like it!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Really enjoyed the book...an easy read with surprising twists! A neighbor recommended it and I also would recommend it...a must read.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone except those who like weird stuff, dark places and lots of unusual looking characters!
B000062XFG|4.0|I got this for my son but, unfortunately, one of the discs cracked when he tried to take it out of the box.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's a fine book and its very interesting. It got me excited to read more. It was a surprise at the end
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|It is really fun. It is great to build the village ; So you want to play more levels.<br />I also like you have more then one way to play. If you like match games this is a really good one.
0425263908|5.0|This is the first novel in this series. I enoyed the plot which had many surprising twists, as well as steamy romance that kept me reading.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW!! It's exciting, and fun. And it's fun watching those three good looking boys every week.  When's Castiel going to be back?
0425263916|5.0|This is the second book in the series. After reading, &#34;Bared to You&#34; I had to immediatley start this one.  This is like &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; with a little less raunch and more plot twists that kept me guessing.  I can't wait to read &#34;Entwined With You&#34; when it comes out soon.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I haven't read anything like this but found it interesting. At times it was long and descriptive but just added to the story line of this book
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I'm new to dieting and exercising and had no clue where to start. This book gave me a quick guideline to begin healthy eating and I'm already down 5 pounds in 3 weeks. It was hard at first, but now that I am in the habit of it, I look and feel ten times better than I did before. These tips are easy to follow and great for anyone that is not sure the best way to lose weight. I also picked up [[ASIN:B00C015E9O 50 Healthy Slow Cooker Recipes: 50 Simple and Healthy Recipes for Slow Cooked Meals]] for those nights when I'm super busy and can't take the time to cook a whole meal. This way I can have a meal waiting for me when I get home and it follows most of the guidelines in this book. Overall, both of these books will help you get into bikini shape in no time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|the books are great i just cant get enough of them ! Once you start you just cant put them down
0061978078|5.0|Delirium, Pandemonium, Delirium Stories ....on my way to Requiem! These books always keep me in suspense and shock. Would definitely recommend. Lauren Oliver knows how to paint a picture in your mind.
B008QTUA5W|1.0|I've now struggled, gritting and/or gnashing my teeth the whole time, through the first three episodes of this Showtime cable series and I'm forced to say that, in my evidently lonely view, it's the worst, most aggravatingly offensive piece of tasteless trash I've seen since I watched the first episode of a show called Breaking Bad about a chemistry professor who discovers he has terminal lung cancer and turns to making crystal meth to lay up a nest egg for his family. What grand entertainment! As with that dreadful vehicle, there are no - repeat, no - even remotely likeable characters in Homeland, especially Carrie Mathison, the hyper-obsessive, bipolar psycho on an obviously self-redeeming witch hunt based on the thinnest of evidence - a whispered comment by a dying agent with zero specifics. She is either sitting around watching Brody have sex with his wife or, much worse, masturbate in front of her (which almost made me vomit) on TV monitors fed by spy cameras implausibly and illegally implanted in every room of the Brody house except, of course, the garage so we can get a tantalizing peek at Brody doing his suspicious Muslim prayers. This goes brobdingnagian leagues beyond any simple wiretapping. Then we get to see her wiping her vagina while brushing her teeth (a very edifying and important addition to the story, although perhaps it does say something revealing about the character), not to mention getting her \\"assets\\" killed in dark alleys after swearing to protect them. Have I missed something? What is there to like about this suppurating rubbish? A 16 year-old girl describing the game of Hearts as \\"c--t hunt\\" at the family breakfast table, or telling her mother about the fact she knows she's been busy \\"f-----g Dad's good friend Mike\\" (which we got to graphically see in the opening scenes), and all of this apparently on prime time cable TV (finding out that Obama was a big fan was somehow the coup de grace; does he make time to watch such drivel between campaigning, golf, and vacations?). Who are the good guys - the bad guys? Who can tell? Is it anti-Islam, anti-American, or both in equal measure? I'd say the latter. Was Brody a prisoner in Iraq or Afghanistan? We seem to get it both ways. Al Qaeda's Abu Nazir nauseatingly cuddles Brody like a baby after he graphically beats his black friend to death, evidently at Nazir's orders. Good grief! It sure isn't The Joy of Sex, although there's much more than enough of that (and reams of profanity, nudity, and other gratuitous offal), all of it a total turn-off. Even the kids are constantly using the \\"F\\" word. Screening girls clad only in thong panties for the Sheik's harem was a particularly scintillating scene, especially when the aforementioned (and doomed) \\"asset\\", after asking how an applicant feels about anal sex and sex with girls, feels her crotch and then orders a Brazilian wax because the Sheikh doesn't care for hair.(Do beautiful young girls really line up eagerly to apply to be sex slaves for rich Arab sheiks? What a repellent thought, but probably they do. Greed is everywhere - especially in Hollywood.) And where is this incredibly thin plot going anyway? Brody either is or is not going to turn out to be what Mathison is so sure he is - something the audience is apparently destined to waste years waiting to find out - and then what? In fact, who cares? Mystery? Tension? A nail-biting \\"thriller\\"? Award-winning performances? A lot of enthusiastic reviewers seem to think so and have lavished outrageous praise on it, but I'm certainly not among them. The Manchurian Candidate was a pretty good movie - a bit far-fetched maybe, but mercifully short and still pretty good thanks to Lawrence Harvey and Frank Sinatra - but this transparent and ridiculous lift from that hoary old plot is pathetic and so is everyone in it.
B00AWA5H60|5.0|Awesome singer plus, has different artest that sings with him .. The songs are clubs dancing songs down fall there isnt just wish album cd could hold more songs of his .. I would buy more David Guetta albums and would spread the word too buy his album
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|A seemingly random assembly of anecdotes and advice that must have been pieced together while riding the subway from 86th st to Rockefeller Center. While I did find some genuinely funny jokes, Mrs. Fey's sarcastic self consciousness always seemed to be weighing down the humor. While I appreciate the book, I will no find it hard to appreciate her as an actress, especially knowing all of her confessions in this limp effort of a book.
B004GCQ2WS|5.0|This album from Daivd show that he could sing with different artest and they could make amazing songs together , im looking forward owning this cd for my collection but im waiting still for the album i could say its mine, for now wait until its come still before its due date.. Must get album if you love dance music .
B005PK1G76|2.0|This fits the B-Agile on a slant, so beverages with holes (e.g. hot coffee) spill out onto the stroller.  Drinks with lids are ok, but the cup holders are a little small so you have to shove them in there.  It also has a weird chemical smell, like other reviewers said.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game keeps me busy for hours its so much fun u have to get subway surfer and theres challenges so u dont just run on and on and on forever
B006M9NJFG|5.0|I absolutely love this thing. It's a great canteen for any purpose. The top and the bottom snap together nicely.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|All 3 movies on one disc, very NICE!!!!!!  If you liked the Austin Power trilogy then this is must buy for you fans out there.  I got it at a real good price.  The movies are still funny to this day.  I'm also excited to hear that Mike Meyers is considering making a 4th movie.  Can't wait for that one.
B008EEWN6I|5.0|This song has a punk-ish feel to it. It's more rock oriented than Imperfect Harmonies, and has a different vibe than Elect the Dead. This is more of something you can get passionate about while singing and such. Magnificent, as always. :)
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I read this book shortly after a trip to India, so I could relate well to what the author described in the book.  Although fictional, I found it very educational on the many cultural aspects touched by the book: life in the slums, the black market, the police culture, etc.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|Overall the game board works great. The only thing I found fault with would be the joystick does not work in degrees pushing it a little is the same as pushing it all the way. Everything else is great.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I gave it two stars because of the costume design, the only good thing about this film. Like many others, I fell asleep during this movie - twice. I should have taken Keira's word literally when she said it would be filmed on a stage. LITERALLY every inch of this theater is incorporated into the film. Though a clever idea I found it to be quite annoying with the fake props, and running up and down the stairs. Glad I didn't see this in the theater.
0345803485|1.0|I never had any desire to read this book but a friend gave me the trilogy so I'm plodding my way through it. And plodding is being generous.<br /><br />No need to repeat what the other reviewers have said. In a nutshell, I hate both of the main characters and their nonstop gasping. And shy smiling. And looking down at their fingers.<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea how this book got past a query, let alone made it to print.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Excellent movie for my little man! At 3 years old, I worried he might be frightened by the villain, but he didn't seem bothered by him. Parents, as with any movie, you may want to pre-screen this film and consider your child's threshold for spooky characters.<br /><br />Love the Easter Bunny character!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A wonderfully written novella. Sanderson continues to impress me with his work that just seems to improve with each story he puts to paper.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|All Clint's movies are good.......Haven't come across one yet that that i disliked!  I  would recommend this movie to anyone!
B009AMANH4|5.0|When will they stop gouging us with these bulls*** 2-Disc Combo Packs of new releases on Blu-Ray? If I have a Blu-Ray player I don't want the DVD, okay? The movie companies think we're stupid and can't recognize the padding they're doing to increase the price, here's what I have to say, stop it and I'll buy the new release at a reasonable price instead of watching it on ON DEMAND and then buying a used copy 6 months from now.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I liked this as well as the Seal Team Six video. It kinda has its moments where you might find yourself trying to stay awake, but overall it was a good show.  Thanks.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Think i am one of the few, thought this was just ok.  I'm not a fan of books that go back and forth in time written from 2 different people's perspective.  Ending left something to be desired.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|When Preston & Child created a new hero in \\"Gideon's Sword,\\" I was excited. Then I read the book and was disappointingly transported into the world of YA fiction: a virtually indestructible hero performing ridiculous acts of derring-do against cardboard villains. Then \\"Two Graves\\" came on the market and although I was thoroughly sated with the \\"Helen Esterhazy\\" saga, my eagerness to read more Pendergast won out. I now wish I had not bothered. The two authors have turned Pendergast into Gideon. They complicate the book with two unnecessary story lines that relate neither to each other nor to the main plot and succeed only in interrupting the narrative flow. The plot itself [spoiler alert] is a hybrid of \\"The Island\\" and \\"The Boys from Brazil\\" and Pendergast has taken to using his brawn instead of his brain. Maybe it's time to retire the agent or for Preston & Child to dissolve their writing partnership? I enjoyed reading Child's \\"Third Gate\\"and the other books he wrote alone, so I have vowed to avoid any titles with both authors names on the cover from now on. I feel like a husband who awakens to discover his wife has been cheating on him for some time and now it's in his face.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I saw the trailer in the theater and just knew I had to see it!  This movie is super funny, adorable, and the music is addictive!  I bought the soundtrack.  I love the music from the finals.  Totally recommend owning this, you will want to watch it over and over!
B00B97SNJI|3.0|Dawes are a great band. Touring nonstop, great musicians, outstanding live act, great voice, great guys as far as I can tell. You have to love 'em, and their music is pretty good, too. Their debut, North Hills, is a classic of hushed, melancholy Americana combined with some straight-ahead rock, and follow-up Nothing is Wrong features more immediate songwriting and much-appreciated Jackson Browne homages. Stories Don't End doesn't leave as much of an impression. The production is cleaner and softer than ever. Taylor Goldsmith's voice sounds great, but he is starting to fall into that thing Browne did where his phrasing sounds similar on many of the tracks. A few standouts for sure-- Just My Luck is one of their very best songs-- but these guys seem up for a challenge and you get the impression this album, while just fine, is a bit too \\"easy\\" for its own good.
B004US4K2C|1.0|I love my kindle fire HD but hate that i can't personalize it. This app would be great  only you no longer support it on kindle. Please fix this!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Astonishing storyline, relevant (India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, poverty, crime, corruption) and well-written but what is so startling is the narrative voice.  Only &#34;A Fine Balance&#34; (also a masterpiece) rivals this as a modern and sweeping tale of India.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|It acts like it is loading the feed but nothing plays at all it would be nice if they would fix the problem
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app. is great. I thought it would be confusing, but it wasnt. It has never gone down or stopped working.
1476734941|4.0|After reading this book I think I will try the fast diet. Fasting 2 days a week does not sound to dificult
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is great.  It's nice if you're having to wait somewhere and you just pull your Kindle out and catch up on your reading.  Price is right also.
B004SGWYW4|4.0|The series is decent for what it is; the one thing that is important is you can't take anything too seriously.<br />It's like if someone was just thinking; hey you know what would go great with these breasts? Zombies...  And just ran with it...<br />The characters are just stereotypes, and are not trying to be anything more than that.<br /><br />The story is a combination of:<br />30% How people would handle a zombie outbreak.<br />30% Crazy matrix-esque fighting scenes.<br />20% Breasts<br />20% Putting the main character in compromising situations with (insert female character here).<br /><br />If you don't like bad horror movies, this is not for you.<br /><br />Overall, it was fun to watch, just don't pay more than 20-30$.
B004HAEGP4|3.0|Yeah I used to love this stuff I guess I'm growing out of it b/c I wasn't that into it as I thought I'd be or it just wasn't that good I don't know.
B00168HARG|3.0|Item I've received was a used copy (broken factory seal & re-shrink wrapped package).  It's a great show, however buying something when it was advertised as a &#34;New&#34; but in reality &#34;Used&#34; makes this purchase a real bad experience.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|It takes a little getting used to, but this vertical mouse helps my sore wrist. The small size is great and fits me perfectly. The mouse buttons are fully customizable. A great find!
0307476073|5.0|An inspiring story about a young woman's journey out into the wilderness. A book that  you definitely won't want to put down, that will stay with you for weeks to come!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|For me this had to be the best movie of 2012, and one of the best films I've ever seen.<br />The storyline is great, characters are very well done, the music is epic, and the scenery is absolutely beautiful.<br />A must buy for any fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy or someone who loves a good adventure.<br />The Hobbit an unexpected Journey easily earns a 5 out of 5 rating.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|I got this white cover as just to make sure I had something to cover my kindle. Not because it's cool or anything.
B009O07NDY|5.0|A great buy for any fan of The Hobbit.<br /><br />The packaging is very cool, and on the inside are 2 cds with 32 tracks in total, and there are notes on how the soundtrack came to be.<br />all of this for a reasonable price.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great followup to the first book. Can't wait to read the next installment, which I think I'll download right now.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing love story!!! True love always prevails! They are perfect for each other and I'm so glad Eva didn't get hurt and it was a happy ending! Highly recommend thus series!
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|I chose these DVDs because I absolutely love all the Dirty Harry movies and think Clint Eastwood is a brilliant Actor and Director. I have always enjoyed His movies and while I have seen most of his movies several times, I chose these movies to purchase as they are my favourites.<br />I always let all my friends and family about the purchases I get from Amazon and emphasise the excellent delivery conditions of all purchases and I am pretty sure after all the years I have been using the service that Amazon provides the ability to purchase DVDs both music and movies and TV Series' there has only ever been 1 DVD that I was unable to buy as it was not available in this region, or something to that effect (I'm not sure what that means) but I was unable to complete the purchase. Amazon.com is awesome!
B004P8ITGU|1.0|Sorry to be so negative, but I don't like the plots or character.  There are so many good books written by John Grisham, but this is not one of them.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice change of pace from continual action games. Easy to learn, and if you pace yourself, you will always have and earn coins and gems.
B005K2Z2O2|3.0|The cover is very tough and probably long lasting.  The downside is that the material is very thick so the flap does not lay flat.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|bought this for my boyfriend because he is a Jimmy Page fan; but to my surprise, I loved it too.  You see such a different side to these musicians.  The music is amazing.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was okay but not a very good book amazon you need to step up and put out some good books

B009MYAQK4|5.0|MANUSCRIPT FOUND IN ACCRA by PAULO COELHO<br />\\"Daughters of<br />Jerusalem weep not,<br />for me,<br />but weep for<br />yourselves, and for<br />your children.<br /><br />Luke 23:28<br /><br />This is a story about different truths. Truths I would say are needful in order for me to continue my life journey successfully. The Copt answers the questions from a rabbi, a neighbor, a merchant, a young woman, etc. Each of these people asks a significant question of the Copt.<br /><br /> By the way the Egyptians ultimately gave the papyri to the Coptic museum in Cairo, Egypt. The papyri were found in the 1940's and went through different hands before landing in the Cairo museum. Anyway, it felt almost too good to be true to read questions I have wondered about myself.<br />  None of the life questions bored me to tears. I sat in bed or on the couch reading at my normal rate of speed but praying all of the wonderful, wise and beautiful answers would stick in my head for the future. Then, I remembered a good goal would be to reread the book. Then, I will journal part of the book for reference. It is amazing how PAULO COEHLO could write in such a simple way the answers to questions only owned by wise men. The people ask questions about solitude,  defeat, anxiety, etc. Rather than making life seem too difficult to live the author made life's journey seem like one I could take with ease if I only tried and didn't mind failing along the way. My impression is that it's important never to give up. I thought of a sermon I once heard. The minister begins the sermon with the words Never Give Up. He said those words ten times in succession. He told us Winston Churchill had spoken those three words in a famous speech.<br /><br />Thank goodness the Manuscript Found In Accra leaves room for failure. I'm one of those people who have to practice, practice, and practice until I get it right. Then, I might fall down all over again. I need that room for Grace. Here is what is written about failure in Manuscript Found in Accra. \\"Failure does not allow us to dream. Its motto is: \\"Expect nothing and you won't be disappointed.\\" Paulo Coelho also writes about death. This is the one time we can't run away from ourselves or get a friend to walk with us around a dark corner. He calls death \\"the unwanted visitor.\\" I think the most important words were about feeling useless. Again, the author writes \\"Nothing in this world is useless in the eyes of God. Not a leaf from a tree falls, not a hair from your head, not even an insect dies....Don't try to be useful. Walk neither faster nor slower than.....<br /><br />There are many words written about dreams, taking risks and what if feels like not to take a risk and settle for the humdrum mode of life. In the author's words \\"I will look at everything and everyone as if for the first time, especially the small things that I have grown used to....\\"  As seen this is a powerful book. Reading the questions is also delightful like the main meal when I'm so hungry the feeling is unbearable.coelhopauloailure in Manuscript Found in Accra. \\"Failure does not allow us to dream.

B0093FNZT6|3.0|I think it is very difficult to explain such an important way of thinking and the author has done a good job by sharing his personal enthusiasm about his extraordinary experiences.
1432794426|5.0|So happy there is finally a book out there that really tells the truth about Michael. He was such a sweet, kind and caring man. Karen Moriarty does not rely on tabloid trash to sell her book. This is a book everyone should read to see the man as he truly was. Well researched.
B005LAII08|5.0|Great movie, arrived very quickly.  Will shop again!  I love that it comes with 5 different options. A definite must buy.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|My family loves this movie.  We saw it twice at the theater (and we usually don't see movies in the theater).  When we knew it was coming out on dvd I was going to pre-order through WalMart.com and would have to pay shipping and tax, but then I found it on Amazon for $3 cheaper than the WalMart price with no shipping and tax!  Thank you Amazon!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Really great fun to read, it will uplift your spirits.  Tina Fey is one of the funniest women in today's world.

0307914550|5.0|I listed to the audio book of Born to Run and couldn't wait to get back to it each time. It is one of my favorite books. There are three reasons I liked it so much, but any one of them would be enough.<br /><br />1. The story of the various ultra runners is very interesting. I kept finding myself rooting for one runner or another and anxiously waiting to see if they pulled through. I suspect that some of the story telling is dramatized, but that's to be expected.<br />2. As a fairly new runner, there were many tips in the book. Some of them may be controversial, but the author makes his arguments well.<br />3. The incredible drive and perseverance of the runners (and the author) is very inspiring. I found myself looking forward to my next run every time I listened to the book.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a very informative story on many levels.  It gives clear easy to understand explanation for complicated scientific procedures and policies and it gives an compelling insight to the Lacks family.  I would recommend this book for reading in a high school biology class.  This is an excellent introductory exercise to get students invested in learning about cells.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was a.great sequel to the first book in the series. Draws you in so you don't want to put it down.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this battery app about as much as I love my kindle before I decided to get this one I checked out a couple of them but I loved this one the best it lets you know when to charge and how much of a charge you have left to surf the web or stream movies or listen to music I just love it
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|Book well written. Hard to believe this is happening in this day and age anywhere in the world. We will never learn from our past.

B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|I have big hands and could only find small laptop styled mouses, and this mouse looks to be on the large side. However, due to the placement of the three optional mouses buttons on the side I found it awkward to hold and use.<br /><br />One of the perks they advertise is you can change the color of the logo design and you can make it throb, but the glowing wheel stays blue, not sure why they would make one side able to change color and not the other.<br /><br />A large annoyance  for myself is that every-time I started my machine I had to start the mouse's software and reload my saved settings which grew old quickly.<br /><br />While I am  not a hard core gamer I do like to play games, but yet could not get all the fancy buttons to work in the game.

B001OGWY1W|3.0|If they have, I must've missed it.<br /><br />This is a movie I am compelled to watch over and over, but not because it's a great movie. Parts of it are good. Ledger does a great job with what he's been given.<br />But in the end I expect the best response to what I'm about to say is the ridiculous \\"It's just a movie\\" response.<br /><br />One of reasons I watch this movie over and over is Heath Ledger. He went beyond the call of duty preparing for this role, and for one reason or another it cost him<br />his life. That in itself makes the movie larger than fiction.  It makes it legendary, scary, evil and thus, sadly, more attractive. Another thing that makes me watch this movie is to figure out what the hell I'm watching and why it's so ridiculous. And, if I'm missing something, please explain it to me.<br /><br />This movie is a joke in many ways, but still irresistible in ways. The way the bus comes in and kills the guy about to shoot the Joker in perfect place and timing. Uh-huh. Ok, we're already at the \\"It's just a movie\\" excuse. And why did that bank \\"hero\\" (an oxymoron) go off on the monologue about how thieves used to have honor and respect? What the hell is he talking about? And never mind the over-acting.<br /><br />Situational and script-wise (not regarding Ledger's superb performance), the Joker is a joke. He makes the Osama Bin Laden official story, causing 9/11, and it's military shut down and detonation of 3 buildings, etc, seem very believable compared to the Joker's superhuman powers to infiltrate and blow up buildings and cause all sorts of chaos without ever getting caught. I know, I know, \\"It's just a movie\\". Sorry, such excuses make me feel as ill-willed as The Joker himself.<br /><br />This movie is devoid of any humor. When Batman says \\"I'm not wearing hockey pants\\". It's not funny. It's ridiculous. It takes wit to provide quality humor so go figure. Not in Gothom City. Some of the bit players are horrible actors.<br /><br />But, still I'll watch this movie again and again... in part to recognize all the issues I have with it. The ending was very Hollywood cliché. The Joker somehow has Batman dominated on his back and of course has to give a speech first before killing him, allowing Batman to use some of his multi-billion dollar weaponry. Yawn.<br /><br />When the guy on trial pulls out the gun and attempts to shoot Harvey Dent. WTF was that? How did he get a gun in there and why was it not loaded if he went through all that trouble?  Really stupid. Early on, a part of me gave up on this movie, but still I had to sit through it to see what would happen.<br /><br />In the end, when all is said it done all one can say, unfortunately is that damn old phrase I've heard too many times and hate with total passion: \\"It's just a movie\\".<br /><br />I can go on and on and on and comb through the flick and pic many more examples of things I have issues with but I think you've got my point.<br /><br />Blah.<br /><br />3 stars for Ledger, some of the visuals, dialogue and action. And I feel I'm being generous in giving it 3 out of 5. I really don't get the majority of 5 star reviews. To them \\"It's just a movie\\" is not a phrase that causes a deep feeling of disgust, I presume.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|A powerful new CD and great follow up to his comeback \\"My Secret Life\\" CD. This is a great collection of songs and the CD is good from start to finish. Eric's voice is as great as ever and he's not afraid to let loose. While Clapton and many other old contemporarys put out disappointing, half-hearted efforts, Eric Burdon shines brighter than ever. Best CD of the year in my opinion.

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Perfect! Speedy delivery and perfect packed condition. Love the quality of restoration along with new FX... making it more crisp and a better viewing experience.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I chose this rate because the book has good definitions to the words.it helped me understand the words meaning.The author has a good way of describing the words
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I was sad to see that my new tablet was NOT compatible with Amazon MP3. I have Amazon Mobile and Amazon Appstore on it so I thought MP3 would be no problem and...well...it's not even in the appstore for me to get and when I tried from the site,it said it wasn't compatible. I have so many credits built up,to just sit there and go to waste because my Mach Speed Trio is not compatible. Rather than it not being compatible with my tablet,I do love this! I had this on my old phone and it was awesome how easy it was to find albums,random music,and specific songs.It was super easy to get to the music and download it(purchase it with credit) and not to mention the bonus credit you get when you purchase other apps through the amazon store or buy stuff off of Amazon. 4 stars all the way,would have given it 5 if it was compatible with my tablet. Keep Rockin Amazon!
1439102732|1.0|I have enjoyed a few of Jodi's books and consider them good yarns, but light fiction. What could have been a gripping story is really a shallow portrayal of all characters concerned, notably the gay-bashing, Westside Baptist stereotypes used for the Christians. Why even mention that Max is an alcoholic without giving THAT issue some depth. The entire story line feels as though the author needed to get her liberal political agenda on the NYT bestseller list and get paid at the same time. No depth of character development. The story is so predictable and nauseating that I stopped a third of the way through the book. I am just thankful that I didn't waste what little money I have on this drivel (if you're not patronizing your local library, you may be wasting your money on new books.) Really, an unbelievable tome of stereotyping. The kind of book that just keeps us all separated by hate.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|The case was broken. I have noticed that the last several CD's I have ordered have cases that are cracked or broken.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|very well done, characters are real and compelling. Wild story line.<br />couldn't wait to see each episode! highly recommend this show
B00377V6J2|5.0|Stevie is always great but with the addition of Albert King to the mix it was stupendous.  Albert was a wonderful counter point to Stevies misic.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|No respect for any form of human life. Ignores the fact that the USA invaded another country, wonder how the US would feel about those who invaded it's shores.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|You just cannot go wrong with &#34;Stevie&#34;.  His career was cut way to short for such a talent; I am sure there was a lot more to love abvout his music to come.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Okay. I've always loved temple run... but I started to get bored with the first one because it was nothing new. just powers, and running from the evil demon monkey. &#60;---(awesome) but with this new temple run two, you can go in a cave, get new powerups and new obstacles, it's just so amazing!
B009ZG6YQO|5.0|This is such a beautiful book for women to read.  It is elegantly written yet the messages are timeless.  All women will relate to the struggles, the passion and the lives of these women of Avalon.  I love stories that are told from the feminine experience and this tale of King Arthur's court has been no exception.  It's a woman's story in a mans world.  It's a long read but it's worth it.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I have never in my whole 30+ years of life hated a movie-- until now.  I wish I could mark this a 0 star review.  Out of the full 86 minutes of this movie, there are maybe 15 total minutes worth watching... as for the rest of it, I want those 71 minutes of my life back.  I am a connoisseur of horror movies, and I am absolutely puzzled how people could say this is the scariest movie they've ever seen.  While I think the basic premise of the \\"use your imagination\\" and \\"home video\\" gimmicks are fun and creative, that is where the comparisons to The Blair Witch Project end.  This movie as a whole bored the heck outta me.  So much time is spent on the uneventful lives of this couple- fiddling with the camera, talking about their days, doing homework, talking about what is going on in their house, sprinkling baby powder on the floor - but the worst parts are when we as the audience are burdened with terrible acting and seeing the couple watching the videos of the previous night, clips we have already seen.  Was it really necessary to subject us to view the same video bits twice?  As an audience, there is nothing more offensive than wasting our time watching a bunch of nothing and repeated clips.  They may as well have just taken the decent 15 minutes of the film and looped it to fill 90 minutes of screentime!  Also, I can usually look past tiny inconsistencies in movies, but I struggled to look past the ones in this film - such as how could a young college couple afford such a luxurious house and video camera BUT not be able to replace their old box TVs with new flatscreens?  I know that may seem like such a minor thing to most people, but combined with everything else, it just contributed to making this movie difficult to watch or be scared by it -- I get more scared watching Back To The Future.  I even tried to give the series a second chance by watching Part 2 - now there's a total of 177 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.  There is a good reason why the price for this DVD is now only $4-- Do not waste your time!
030758836X|2.0|This book was very disappointing.  There is not one character that you can engage with or care about what happens to them in the novel.  It drags along through the first half of the book and then you get a little twist in the plot and think,  &#34;maybe now&#34;.  This hope is short lived as these miserable, nasty people continue with their meaningless lives.  The end of the book provides a mere glimmer of interest but, I won't spoil that little moment for you.  Good luck with this.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|The movie was engaging but the buffering interrupted the flow of the movie countless times!  It was the worst experience I ever had watching through Amazon.
0824835921|4.0|If there's one thing that scares the living daylights out of the Japanese learner, it's the mountainous prospect of learning those dreaded Kanji. But have no fear, for Heisig has produced a book that will give you the tools for quickly, and effectively, conquering these mighty foes.<br /><br />This book takes a unique approach to learning the characters, in that, no readings are to be memorised, no vocab. Nothing.<br /><br />In fact, this Book could be said to contain NO JAPANESE whatsoever. Instead, the Kanji are broken down in to constituent parts, which Heisig calls primitives. These can be the more traditionally acknowledged building blocks known as \\"radicals\\", but also encompass recurring shapes which are not traditionally considered to be of much importance. These primitives are given names, and are then used to construct vivid stories, to be imagined by the reader, in order to thoroughly burn the whole Kanji's English \\"keyword\\" in to the readers mind.<br /><br />Be wary though, as while the keyword may be the meaning of the Kanji or primitives, it can just as oft be not, or be an extremely obscure meaning, even archaic or completely redundant. Furthermore, in cases of characters which carry similar meanings, different keywords, with similar meanings may be used. However it is important to note, that in such cases, the different nuance of the English keywords may not be reflective (and often is not) of the nuance of meaning between the two Kanji.<br /><br />Ultimately, 'Remembering the Kanji' is all about teaching you Kanji recognition and reproduction, NOT about teaching you any Japanese, and if one goes in to this book with an understanding of that, one will find this an indispensable leg up with their Japanese studies.
B00004S35Z|5.0|An enduring classic, this album has been on my permanent playlist since it came out in the '70s. \\"Smile Please\\" is surely one of the most beautiful songs ever set to vinyl. Stevie was the wonder of wonders for a while there, but went soft and mushy after his accident. No matter, he'd already made enough great music to ensure his place among the highest reaches of the firmament.
0345529057|4.0|This never-ending story filled with love, duty and honor has numerous unexpected twists and turns, as well as likeable and unlikeable characters, but I'm loving it so far . . .
B001GM7G4Y|5.0|This album is G N'R Lies.  This cd threw me off a little bit.  I have other versions of this album,  but what threw me off with this buy is where it had the letters (Shm) next to title.  Here I am thinking it would be slightly altered in terms of maybe wording or alteration on the artwork. There wasn't any.  If your a first time buyer of this album,  this is a very contraversial album.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such an entertaining show.  Season 3 was definitely worth the money to rent.  It's one of the few shows my husband and I can agree on. Bravo!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I got my DVD and immediately watched it to make sure it was not deffective. The moved played well with no problems. Thank you!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A fun game.  I have only started playing it but look forward to playing more.  It gets more challenging as I go along.
B004HD61KE|3.0|Hard to put down. Believable and leads to looking into more information and history. Mr. Rollins writes with beautiful descriptions and detail.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Wish the first movie was as good as the Lord of the Rings were.  It was still good but did not seem to be quite as sharp as the Rings.  Disappointing too that it is three movies but that's just big business and a long time to wait.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I had just finished &#34;Practical Paleo&#34; and was about 32 days into that lifestyle when I came across this book. Dropping even further into a cleaner lifestyle - dropping all dairy and sugars, even natural sugars - made a huge difference. I have a previously &#34;incurable&#34; skin condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa. This is a horrible disease... but through Paleo and elimination of certain foods I have found that I am able to manage it... no drugs, no creams,  no doctors.<br />Since changing to this lifestyle I also haven't had to take any OTC pain killers (Advil, Tylenol, etc) for headaches, minor body aches or major body aches. I have arthritis in my shoulder - no pain - not taking any drugs.<br />Everyone should read this and take 30 days to change their life for the better!
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|I had to watch this movie for class, it was a great movie and my first time ordering movie online to be watched on my computer, great quality.

B007STXHTM|5.0|After a string of disappointing recordings while scuba diving in the Caribbean, we discovered the included waterproof casing was useless underwater. This on the other hand is what I expected from our GoPro. If you want to record underwater this is essential.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It does start out slow but once you get past the first few chapters it is very hard to put down!!! Loved it would read another book by this author in a heartbeat!!
0345528581|5.0|Yes. Myself.<br /><br />This is one of the most thorough introductions to bodyweight training I have ever read. Keep in ind it is also the only one. Its informative in telling you what muscles you're working and why, it even has a whole section that teaches you how to properly perform the exercises. I was no disappointed in the LEAST with this book. I love this book so very much.<br /><br />Also, I like cute muscley men on the covers of my books. That's a plus for me.
B000NY12LO|5.0|It was an excellent book! Having 5 children of my own and battling bullying issues it really makes you think! Had a hard time putting this book down! Even though the story was not based on a true story it sure captivates real issues in the schools and how often the depths of bullying issues are ignored and overlooked.  Loved it but have yet to read a bad book by Jodi Picoult!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great book and an easy read. I loved all the characters from the start. The story kept me interested and wanting more.
1451627289|4.0|I read &#34;11/22/63&#34; and enjoyed it greatly.  I wanted another copy to give to a friend who is an expert on the Kennedy assassination and I thought he would enjoy the book but did not want to spend a lot on a hard bound copy. The used library book was perfect. He can pass it on to someone else when he is done with it.
B00993FEUK|3.0|My 3.5 year old cannot watch the movie. Whenever we turn it on she keeps telling us it's scary. Well, maybe for a 3.5 year old. But my husband and I like it :D And it's not too scary for us ;)
B007REV4YI|5.0|Fun to watch several times but I still think the first Daniel Craig Bond movie was the best of the three. Looking forward to many more. Craig is right up the with Connery as the best Bond ever.
B00466HN72|5.0|Although, I don't really LIKE this movie. My daughter does. My husband thinks it's cute and we got it at a WONDERFUL price! I love to buy all the movies I can that have a digital copy so my daughter can watch them on her IPAD!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|FANTASTIC production of Les Mis. And stay until the very end to see stars of past performances.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Les Mis.
B005VPRDAY|4.0|What can I say? They're legos.  These are original size in pretty colors, two different greens, two pinks, purple, orange & white pieces. The container is a generous size, only about two inches full so there's lots of room to add more. It's sturdy and closes securely. Also includes instructions to make the scene on the box.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I tried the free app and it was so nice I bought the paid version. Just a nice simple alarm clock. The screen is clean design, not cluttered with lots of junk I don't need.  Easy to set up and program.  Works just like a real clock.  Very intuitive. Nice app!
0307165485|5.0|Calling Richard Scarry's \\"Best Storybook Ever\\" a story book is truly a misnomer.  Richard Scarry's contains a handful of stories, a handful of vocabulary books, and a handful of Nursery Rhymes.  In short, it's more than a storybook, it's a full on activity book for kids!  That said, my kids really enjoy this book.  The illustrations are detailed, well colored, and fun for kids to look at (particularly on \\"Feed Big Hilda Hippo Her ABCs - the kids LOVED this story!)  I copy I bought from a used book store included \\"I Am a Bunny\\", although it seems from other reviewers that this story is omitted from newer copies.<br /><br />Something I enjoyed in particular about this book is that it covers a wide range of topics and lessons for kids.  To name a few, this book covers the parts of the body, counting, ABCs, colors and color blending, seasons and months of the year, types of clothing, info on planes and trains, types of animals, and even some info on basic manners.  While this isn't a traditional collection of storybooks, this is a welcome addition to our reading library.  Recommended.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got this to replace my old worn out MX mouse.<br /><br />I like that I can customize the butons, although the placement of them in different spots could be better<br /><br />All in all I would greatly tell my friends about it
B001B6EAOY|5.0|No need to go over the details everyone else already has, just know that this product works perfectly for what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />However, I want to make something clear!  The description for this adapter says it goes up to 16 gigabyte capacity for its max.  I have found that to be inaccurate.  Using two 16 gigabyte microSD cards, I have found the adapter allows you to have 32 gigabytes of storage.  Maybe it even allows 64 gigabytes with two 32 gigabyte microSDs? I don't know, I don't have those sized microSDs to test it with.  At any rate, just be aware, you can get 32 gigabytes of storage with this adapter if you have the necessary sized microSD cards.  I have successfully tested this capacity on two different PSPs with perfect results.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All seasons of this well written and brilliantly acted production are better than anything else on tv. Pure enjoyment and such depth. I feel like I was living at Downton myself. Hats off to writers, directors, producers, costumes, actors and on and on! Thanks for excellence.
B000JWTX3Y|5.0|Very cute and clean movie. My husband and I were laughing almost throughout the whole movie. I definitely recommend if you want to watch a clean romance comedy.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|It is an interesting and entertaining movie, a must see for sci fi fans. It is like matrix meets independence day.
0525953728|5.0|Mark Owen really hits home in his book! You won't want to put this book down! I highly recommend this to everyone that likes SF stuff!
0375713751|3.0|Throughout most of the book, I hated the main character. It was well written and definitely a good plot, the end was it's saving grace for my disdain of the lead character. I probably won't read it again, it didn't sit with me well enough.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I really like the Prometheus movie! If you enjoy sci-fi movies, you will really enjoy this movie in blu-ray! Highly recommend!
0812968255|5.0|A neat work written in plane English and easy enough for your average college-educated fellow. Easy to carry around and with a beautiful cover. Some books are meant to be finished in a day. Their stories focused on the commonly-shared movements of the human soul. Some others, a much fewer number, discuss deeper topics that simply cannot be digested at once. These Meditations are one of the last kind. A simple-enough looking book, but with a direct challenge to the ways we see the world and live our limited time spans. The language is straightforward and the ideas are presented as the voice of Marco talking to the ear of the reader. A powerful little book.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is an awesome movie! The whole family will enjoy this in blu-ray! Great special effects! I highly recommend this movie!
6303394647|5.0|I use it to not only hold the LD but also the Blu ray and dvd. Great display holder for all formats
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Being in the medical field who has lived with the usual obstinence of M.D.'s, this book was refreshing altho it is preceded by an unfortunate event. Enjoyed it thoroughly, having heard similar experiences by patients all my nursing life. A pleaure...buy it. You won't put it down until the last page comes too quickly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like it. HOWEVER. Ads do pop up and it freezes.  other than that I like it. And what I mean is that when the ads pop up it freezes. but other than that its a fun game
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I found that this book was excellent. I found it was paced so the reader could understand the gravity of the situation that the Gladers were placed in.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|After buying movies from amazon on my kindle and downloading them on my device I am still not able to watch my movies while traveling. If I buy them and download I should be able to watch whenever and wherever I want!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|What a fun and original book!  It's been a while since I've read a book that I have enjoyed this much. I can see why it's one if the best books of the year.  The plot, characters, twists and pace were perfect. I really enjoyed Sloan's style :)
B007FEGH7Y|5.0|Thank g*d for Pandora I would have missed such an amazing musical experience.  Honestly am I missing something why haven't I heard these songs on the radio!!!
B005LAIIGC|4.0|Not one of my top favorites, but still a really good movie. I like the backstory of why the tooth fairy collects teeth and baby tooth is so cute!
1449325947|5.0|This book is a great book for both the beginner and and the experienced web designer and develper alike.  It provides real life examples and lets you work through those examples so that you can get a feel for how you are supposed to do things while helping you not develop any bad habits or practices in your coding.<br />All in all, this is a great guide and reference.
B000002JR8|5.0|FAR BEYOND DRIVEN is the album where PANTERA really went HEAVY!!!! yes, COWBOYS FROM HELL and VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER are masterpieces and heavy too, but on BEYOND they really went HEAVY HEAVY!!!! the riffs are incredibly brutal and insane and Phil screams like there´s no tomorrow....songs like BECOMING, I´m BROKEN, STRENGTH BEYOND STRENGTH and 5 MINUTES are metal gens!!!!!! like all the stuff PANTERA created, this is a masterpiece!!!!!if you like extremely heavy music, this is for you!!!!!!!!!
B004J4WKTW|1.0|In 1932 there was no Internet.  Maybe someone foresaw it and made sure to put an address on the card in the event the circus goer would keep that add for the next 50 years, but I doubt it.  Like I will do with the memory of this book, he probably tossed it in a pile of junk on his bureau and never thought of it again.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|after the great RUST IN PEACE, MEGADETH created another METAL gem with this COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION!!!!!All the songs are amazing, with Skin o my teeth, Symphony of destruction, Foreclosure of a dream, architecture of aggression, Sweating bullets and the title track shining high on the METAL sky!!!!!!TOTALLY GREAT and RECOMMENDED if you like heavy music!!!!!!!WELL DONE, MEGADETH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008MM9630|4.0|The game is fun but most things take a while to complete. Even at the beginning of the game.<br /><br />Alexsnuggle2000@aol
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Wow!!! it takes a long time, but finally the great MEGADETH recorded a album that i put among their BEST stuff!!!!! i really liked SYSTEM HAS FAILED(2004), but on ENDGAME, Mustaine and his mates were really inspired!!!! All the songs are AMAZING!!!!! Reminds me of how incredible MEGADETH are.....GREAT!!!! one of their best among RUST IN PEACE, YOUTHANASIA and COUNTDOWN.....TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!WELL DONE, MEGADETH!!!
B000VNMMR0|1.0|This was supposed to be new but came so scratched up that it wouldn't play. There was no option for an exchange so I kept it and took it to my local movie rental place and had it resurfaced. I won't deal with Overstock again.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|AVENGED SEVENFOLD is a great Metal band, and this album CITY OF EVIL is their best album....WAKING THE FALLEN and NIGHTMARE are great too, but CITY OF EVIL got some amazing songs like BLINDED IN CHAINS, SIDEWINDER, BEAST AND THE HARLOT, BAT COUNTRY and TRASHED AND SCATTERED!!!!!AVENGED is a great band....if you like METALLICA and IRON MAIDEN with Sebastian Bach vocals, you will love this album!!!! AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!

B00AFROVQC|4.0|Just finished reading Sovereing of the Seven Seas.  I found a very different style of writing but I have got into it and have just a few pages to go, then on to book 2.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Could not stop reading the book. Great characters, great scenes. I was totally in into the storyline. I felt like I was part of the story.<br />Feel the movie would be hard pressed to stay in line with the book, but will definitely go and see it.

B00B8WXFWE|2.0|I'm beyond disappointed with this album. If The Block was 2 giant steps forward, 10 is at least 5 steps back. I've been a fan since the very beginning but IMO the guys have completely missed the mark on this album. I've been fiercely loyal for years because NKOTB always worked hard to produce quality despite not getting respect from their industry peers. I don't believe that to be the case with this project so it's hard for me to support it.<br /><br />10 is completely lacking authenticity in my opinion. The group has no connection to the songs they are singing and that's painfully obvious from the first listen. It's not that they are singing someone else's lyrics, it's moreso that they are trying to perpetrate someone else's vision. Singing drab, europop trash and trying to pass it off as a \\"new sound\\" for the group makes the entire effort feel fraudulent to me.<br /><br />Point blank, this album is garbage. I'm disappointed and a little insulted that this is the follow-up they would give us after the brilliance of The Block. That the group would think so little of us (fans) that they'd believe we'd accept anything they decided to throw our way. On this album they have completely abandoned their sound and every song sounds the same. The lyrics are juvenile and definitely not representative of the men we have all loved and respected unabashedly for 25+ years.<br /><br />On this album, I feel like the group moved away from everything that has worked for them in the past in order to manufacture a cheaper product. This is evident in the rudimentary production on the album (from unknown producers DeeKay) and the groups lack of songwriting participation. If that wasn't enough the majority of the songs feature Donnie as a lead vocalist instead of NKOTB's true singers, Jordan and Joe. Who thought that was a good idea? There's a reason Jordan is the lead singer with Joe and Donnie taking their respective places behind him. While I can appreciate them wanting to break from the norm, I can't accept it when it's at the expense of the products quality.<br /><br />The Block was their Cinderella story... but someone forgot to pick up the glass slipper while rushing out of the ball.The new material reeks of minimal effort being put forth  just for the sake of having new material to a) sell and b) perform live. I'm sorry but I believe that we (the fans) deserve better than this. Most of the songs sound like BSB wannabe tunes that the boys from Orlando would've probably rejected themselves. Instead of trying to capture a spot in today's marketplace, the group should be focused on it's core audience. That means writing songs for (primarily) women in their 30s & 40s. We aren't teenyboppers needing to hear about being kissed and missed by them. Can we get some real lyrics about the trial and tribulations of life? Maybe a little something that's socially conscious? Hell, even some throwback material a la Timberlake's 20/20 album would suffice.<br /><br />The only songs on the album worthy of being put on repeat are We Own Tonight and Survive You. Miss You More and Let's Go Out with a Bang (i.e. hidden track) aren't bad either. I also like With Me from the Target edition (also on youtube)<br /><br />Remix - Skipped it. Seriously, one of the worst songs I think I've EVER heard<br />Take My Breath Away, Wasted on You, Fighting Gravity and The Whisper all sound the same<br />Jealous Blue - Snooze<br />Crash - Auto tuned, wannabe dance track garbage that would never be played in the club<br />Back to life - See tacks 3-5<br />Now or Never - Crash 2.0; another track worthy of skipping<br />She's a Killer (from Target edition) is another garbage track<br /><br />In 2008, I thought the reunion could've lasted forever, given the quality of The Block album and subsequent tours, but now I honestly feel like I'm watching the demise of one of my all-time favorite groups. But if this is the type of material that they are going to produce then maybe that's not such a bad thing.uch a bad thing.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|\\"(500) Days of Summer\\" struck me, and not in a good way.  I enjoyed it upon reflection, but not at first.  I felt sad, depressed, and filled with angst immediately following my Valentine's viewing of \\"(500) Days of Summer.\\"  However, like aforementioned, my initial reaction was more based in the circumstance, rather than the actual quality of the film.<br /><br />\\"(500) Days of Summer\\" falls into a sub-genre of the standard romantic comedy-one that I can't really put my finger on.  I am almost positive that there is a name for it, yet my knowledge of film classifications is most impressive once I strike moot.  At parts \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" fit the rom-com bill perfectly; however, on the whole it's an entirely different beast.  It exists in a subset.  It tries to more deeply explore the idea of love, rather than giving audiences another difficult kindling of a couple not meant to-be/meant to-be.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays, Tom.  I wouldn't call Tom `helplessly romantic,' but he is definitely more-inclined to romanticism.  He believes in true love and the concept of a soulmate.  His counterpart, Summer played by Zooey Deschanel, feels oppositely.  She possesses that certain kind of `x-factor' and subsequently has been hit on her whole life.<br /><br />So what would happen if these two met and fell in love?<br /><br />That is precisely the intent behind screenwriters, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber's \\"(500) Days of Summer.\\"  The plot is uniquely structured in that it skips around a 500 day period of Tom's life during which Summer played an influential role.  The two obviously fall in love (after meeting as coworkers), but the real heart of the movie begs the question: Is this the one?<br /><br />As an audience member we get to see the goofy moments, the fights, the make-ups, and all-of-the other little joys and horrors of life's relationships.  The story skips around never linearly progressing through the `500 days,' yet the conversations amongst Tom and the rest of the cast compound to create a cohesive and synergetic film.<br /><br />Funnily enough, the end of the film is quite surprising and poignant in the fact that it doesn't end in the manner that you would hope or expect it to.  Not only does \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" focus on the trials-and-tribulations of relationships, but the gray.  That area between Venn Diagram circles that causes most so much anguish and joy.<br /><br />I found the acting to superb.  Joseph-Gordon Levitt nails his performance and Zooey Deschanel is excellent company.  They have wonderful onscreen chemistry.  It seems a bit of a different role for her (not the typical Manic Pixie Dream Girl role), but it works.  The supporting cast is small, but their scenes are wonderful.  Tom's friends and sister, played by Geoffrey Arend, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Chloë Grace Moretz, add to Tom's personality by creating a funny trio (sometimes quatro) of banter-a type of banter that we have all had with our friends and can easily relate to.  Clark Gregg's portrayal of Tom's boss is perfect.  At times, I wish I had such a pragmatic boss!  Talk about rolling with punches and playing to people's strengths during a time of emotional turmoil.<br /><br />The nonlinear structure definitely plays to the quality of the cinematography in a very positive manner.  Life is chaotic and doesn't make sense, until you start to piece it together after the fact.  The cut of the movie accentuates this, which (again) furthers the relatability of the film.<br /><br />Directing-wise, Marc Webb keeps things in focus when they could easily have gotten off track and into confusing tangents that would have been detrimental to the film.  His skill is definitely praiseworthy and on that note I will leave you with this:<br /><br />Check out \\"(500) Days of Summer.\\"  It's not your typical romantic comedy.  It's something more.  Something to be covenanted and something to entertain ideals with in spare moments.  It's a great film.  Even with my initial reaction I can say this comfortably.Even with my initial reaction I can say this comfortably.

B000P0J0AG|5.0|My bargain-rack DVD movie for last night was \\"Heat\\" starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. I found it in the Wal-Mart five-dollar bin and I picked it up because I've never seen Al Pacino in a bad movie. I still haven't. The movie was excellent. The movie was billed as a Los Angeles crime saga, and I've never seen Los Angeles look so dark and threatening. My goodness, I feel almost afraid to go up there again.<br /><br />There's a lot of really dramatic scenes in this movie. It begins with a spectacular robbery of an armored car. You'll probably wonder how they ever managed to do it. Well, that's Hollywood for you! In any case, an investigation got underway with Los Angeles Detective Al Pacino in charge and gradually leads to larger and larger things and, finally, to an even more spectacular bank heist. De Niro aptly plays the Number One bad guy. There's a lot of gratuitous violence along the way and a couple sub-plots involving romance (De Niro) and marital difficulties (Pacino) to keep things on a more realistic level. A lot of good guys and bad guys bite the dust in blazes of gun battles with some really realistic-looking gunshot wounds. This movie is not well suited to the squeamish.<br /><br />The filming and staging of the movie were excellent. They really went out of their way to make Los Angeles look bleak and threatening and filled with criminal characters. Good Job! The stunts were spectacular, as you might expect. The acting was excellent, not only for Pacino and De Niro, which we'd expect, but for the entire cast. The movie didn't seem particularly believable, however. I'm just not used to viewing Los Angeles in such a bleak way. Perhaps someone who was more of an outsider wouldn't even notice. In any case, it was good, fast-moving entertainment and well worth watching.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

0618001905|5.0|In the annals of recorded holocausts, rarely do we think of the deaths of the many millions of enslaved Africans murdered, tortured, starved, or worked to death by European colonialists.  This book is a painstakingly researched and riveting account of the genocide of the Congolese people by King Leopold of Belgium, with the  complicity of the Catholic Church and Belgian business interests of the time.  (It is somewhat redundant to add &#34;with the complicity of the Catholic Church&#34; as that is a given.)  In any event, African history is not naturally a subject taught in American schools.  One must make a little effort, therefore, to educate oneself on the subject before pronouncing a disparaging opinion on the topics of Africa, Africans, or the seeming lack of progress to be found in the Dark Continent.

B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The opening of this film is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful things I've ever seen in cinema. The landscapes, sets, costuming, equiptment, CGI are all 10++/10, just way, way mind-blowing AWESOME. Unfortunately, the script badly damages the film..2/10. After the opening (which has no dialogue), it's mostly downhill. Stupid, illogical, silly, inane, moronic are just a few terms to describe the script. It is truly painful to watch a film with soooo much potential self-destruct...oh the humanity!..the humanity! If this film had been written with just a LITTLE better script, it would already be a science fiction classic.<br />  Despite this mixed review, any science fiction buff MUST watch this film, if for nothing else the esquisite visuals, awesome special effects, way-cool futaristic technology and completing? the Aliens saga/mythology.<br />  The potential of this film could be salvaged if they would use it as a jumping-off point for an entire new series of films based on pursuing the humanoid aliens across the universe in search of answers and understanding. I would really like to see better written sequels to this movie pursing such a plot-line and mostly leaving the Aliens out (enough already), or perhaps just as a minor bio-weapons sub-plot.

The smallest setting is a reasonable size to work with, but don't clear your keyboard or try to scroll the text, you won't be able to see what you're typing if you call the keyboard back up in portrait mode. Oh, and there's no auto save or ability to suspend this app to the background. I spent an hour making a long list, got a phone call, and my list was gone when I called it back. This app sucks. Too many basic functionality bugs with the keyboard, and wasted time if you suspend the app for any reason.

B007Q1VUFA|5.0|This was a terrific album. I've always been a fan of the Black Crowes and when I saw this had been released I listened to some of the samples and decided to plunge right in. The music reminds me of a stoner version of Black Crowes; being more laid back. The first song, Tulsa Yesterday, has some great keyboards and Star or Stone sounds like some old time gospel set tot he blues. While there's only seven songs they're all seven minutes or more. The only song I didn't care for was Rosalee. It has a nice groove but Chris' vocals are grating.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I hated this novel. I hated it not so much for what it was - which was not much - but what it could have been.<br /><br />I loved the first book. I loved the structure and the pacing. This one was a mirror image of that. It was a complete muck up.<br /><br />The novels are told in the first person. That's great when the first person is the center of the narrative and where the action is at. It's not so great when the first person is stuck back at headquarters where nothing is done but discussion, where there is no action beyond sending an order to where the action is.<br /><br />To compound this bad structural choice, what action that does occurs is short-circuited. Peeta lunges for Katniss' throat. Fight? Fight? Fight? No, end of chapter. Cut to Katniss waking up. Excitement!<br /><br />Prim is blown to bits! Raw visceral emotions? Nope. End of chapter. Cut to Katniss in waking up. (oh, and don't even talk to mom about it until months later. She'll be fine since she did so well with dad's death /sarcasm).<br /><br />Much of the story is told to us rather than shown to us - except for the good parts where we're not told or shown it. Heck, after three books we don't even get the satisfaction of her killing Snow.<br /><br />What we're left with is our classically Romantic warrior-woman reduced to a reality-TV star with a big, broad whiny streak. That made up much of Catching Fire. I missed the Katniss of the first book.<br /><br />Katniss does get a bit of action for about 15% of the book - the mission to the Capitol - but it felt a bit silly and forced to me after she spent so much time slinking around the hallways of the District 13 headquarters.<br /><br />And speaking of 13, obviously, the Capitol has Roman influences and even more obviously District 13 is Sparta with it's own cultural pathologies. Why weren't those two played out more? There's a tremendous amount that could be - and has been - done with that. Heck, Coin's villainy could have been built up just abit more. What dangerous things she does do we're not sure if it's attributed to incompetence.<br /><br />And what was the point of Gale in these books? In this book, especially, I can't think of any. There's his repeatedly saying in one form or another \\"Hey, you're tough Katniss.\\" Oh, and there the time he says \\"Hey, I blew up your sister, Katniss.\\" To which she responds. \\"Yeah, I probably won't be getting over that.\\" But beyond that, what's his point?<br /><br />Finally, the death of Prim just simply pissed me off. She was the original spark of this story. She and Katniss' love for her was its center. Her death obfuscates the entire narrative. In my review of Catching Fire, I cite Casablanca. I'll do so here again. It's almost as if someone had made a sequel to Casablanca and starts it off with Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid's plane hitting some wires at the end of that runway and dying. It would destroy the point of Bogart's sacrifice? Prim's death did the same. It destroyed the sacrifice Katniss made at the beginning of this series when she yelled \\"Pick me!\\" when Prim's name was chosen.<br /><br />This book just made me mad.

0679735909|3.0|Byatt's writing is suitably gorgeous, perhaps too much so for this lame story.  The obscure references and the weighty poetry, which I never entirely got, bogs the story down.  I was lost in the details.  While I really enjoyed \\"Babel Tower\\", the culmination of the stories of the Potters, I did not like \\"Possession\\".  It felt heavy and needlessly obscure, completely obfuscating the flow of the story.  It challenged my vocabulary, but instead of finding this charming, as I did in \\"Babel Tower\\" I found this frustrating.  There is no need to resort to archaic language to get a point across.  I consider this the act of a showoff.  Is it too much to ask that the story, which was a good one, be clear? The poetry was obviously written by the author as I found no poet by the name of Randolph Henry Ash to exist.  Pity.  I would have someone else to blame. I consider myself well read and perhaps, as other reviewers have stated, this novel has made its way into university classrooms.  That is unfortunate.  There are better literary examples out there.  That is not to say that this novel is not worth reading, it certainly is.  Just be prepared for novel that embodies affected language with a presumptuousness that is a hindrance to the narrative.

Merlin is finally seeing a way to step through the door and become Arthur's 'advisor' and... Arthur finally sees the truth in Merlin's words,as showcased in the final two parter \\"The Sword In The Stone\\" arc. There is hope here, lots of it, especially in regards to their trusting each other and being positively protective of each other. The other stories in this series are supplemental and used to drive this central relationship to its heartbreaking conclusion. Colin and Bradley's performances shine and they are an incredible team. A most satisfied veiwer, here. Bring on the Bromance and you've got a fan for the duration!
B003VANOFY|1.0|Such a disappointment. I used to own a Logitech G35 back in the day that I used for a long time until I sold it to a friend of mine who needed a PC headset. I then used a Turtle Beach for a while with wires running literally everywhere. It was terrible, I rolled over the wires countless times until I finally broke them. I figured this wireless would be much more practical for my purposes. The build quality of the headset is excellent. It looks very stylish, the gaming software is neat and helpful (for the most part) and the thing is unbelievably comfortable. One terribly annoying feature is that it turns off after 10 minutes of no sound coming through it, this makes those long silences in vent and teamspeak horrible. Several times my headset had turned off and I just thought no one was speaking for a very long time until I noticed it. Everyone was wondering what had happened to me.<br /><br />Sadly none of that matters whatsoever. The sound quality is terrible. Right out of the box you have to do some serious tweaking to get the thing sounding decent. The surround presets are turned up way too high and must be adjusted and the bass is way too high as well, so much so that it distorts. The mic quality was bad at first too, the gain was turned up way too high and I had to tweak it so that it wasn't staticky (I know, not a real word). Bad thing is, it resets each time the headset is cut off so I had to do this every time until I figured out I could map the G key on the headset to control the gain and that fixed it.<br /><br />Once the thing is optimized it actually sounds wonderful though. Good with music and games. The deal breaker and the reason why it gets a one star review (and is being returned to Amazon) is that it randomly starts crackling TERRIBLY bad. Especially in game. So much so that the sound completely cuts in and out. I've tried everything to fix it and there are countless suggestions on the logitech forums (as well as countless people having the same issue), none of which permanently worked. You could turn it on and off, plug the USB adapter into a 2.0 port instead of the charging base it comes with, update and tweak drivers, disable programs, update the logitech gaming software that the headset uses for everything... nothing fixes it. I would get a temp. fix by restarting my computer but after about 20 minutes of gaming it would start back up again. It would progressively get worse too, to the point that you could barely hear anything other than static and crackling. Such a shame because it's a great piece of hardware when it works.<br /><br />I'm guessing that this is a hardware conflicting problem. A lot of people have it and a lot of people don't and no one really knows what causes it or how to fix it. Some people say certain things work then another group of people say that those things didn't work for them. As I said, nothing worked for me. If you wanna take the gamble then go ahead, they may not give you any issues but be warned. Many people have this problem. A lot of people also have many other problems with the G930's (problems that I didn't have) that I discovered while browsing the Logitech forums. Overall I wouldn't take the risk.
B000005J56|5.0|Thanks for a top cd in my collection! You can see that the owner before me also think so....but no problems with the sound! I love it! Thanks for quickly sending too..
B00BF11STU|1.0|Zero = the star rating I would give it if I could.  Dark = the best part of the movie was so dark you could hardly see what anyone was doing.  Thirty =  of the 2 hours and 37 minutes, only the last 30 minutes were worth watching...but as I said above, most of it was so dark you couldn't tell what was going on anyway.  Waste of time!
B002BWP49M|1.0|Disc was suppose to be new but funny thing was the disc had some kind if imperfections and freezes half way I have a brand new top of the line lg 3d blue ray player so save the accusations all my other ones work fine
B008393Q2O|2.0|Popular apps like Google Keep and Evernote have way more features than this app, including syncing your notes with multiple devices. Syncing lets you type in complex notes on your PC, then read them and check them off on your phone. Or add photos from your phone's camera. The lack of a syncing capability makes this app too basic for most users.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I love Luke Bryan so I was excited when he had a new CD out.  Great songs, love it alot
6305428271|4.0|A great memory of watching this movie. I love the concept of the movie and the story line and it will always be one of my favorites.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|This is wonderful movie for the whole family.  It has humor, family values, and a little romance. We really enjoyed this movie.
030758836X|1.0|This was a book chosen by my book club.  Otherwise I would have never finished it. The story was interesting and may have continued so if it had a better ending.  But the writing is so vulgar and crude that it was hard for me to read it.  There must have been at least 3 or 4 \\"F\\" words on every page.  It is the most vulgar book I've ever read and I thought nothing could be worse than the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\", but this was.  When describing scenes of any intimacy--after all, the people in the book were married--the writer uses very foul language.  The writer is a young lady with a child.  I would be embarrassed for my child to ever read my books if I wrote like this.  Now bear in mind, I am not an old lady prude.  This book just went too far.  I don't expect my novels to border on pornography!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I chose four versions to compare. Some versions are not available offline. I already attend Bible study and am in the habit of daily reading since childhood, but This app encourages community and study through verse of the day, sharing on social media, and plans.
B000SZK41M|5.0|I was chosing between watching the Oscars or paint drying on a wall so I went with the original Die Hard and LOVED IT<br />Seriously the guy runs around without shoes on! That is hot and sexy and I am envious.<br />ok I am being really serious here but did you see the computer rooms I mean glass walls cool right ...<br />Ok, ok I am being really serious here .. the white t shirt with only a few stains on it ...totally amazing.<br />In closing this movie should have gotten an oscar ...I mean the downtown LA building location was awesome fortunately I am not joking when this was WAY better than watching the oscars and plus its like historical reference to like what Professor Snape looked like with blond hair.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story and can hardly wait to see the movie. Well written and told. I will be looking for more stories by this author.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Have you ever wanted an exotic animal for a pet? I suggest getting a kamodo dragon. First off the postal workers will deliver your mail ( OR ELSE! ) promptly. Secondly, you wouldn't need to buy a gun or a sword I mean someone breaks into your home ties you up and sees this kamodo dragon appropriately named &#34;fluffy&#34; walking all slow like that its not going to hurt them then WAM bye bye intruder. Finally, I adore kamodo dragons ..and M .. I mean she got some brains. Kinda a bummer of a story you know I totally was hoping he was her son ... Love the fact we now know Moneypennys first name :)
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|New album packed with new stuff, but if you are a real fan of Santana, you will hear some touches of the older &#34;Santana melodies, and riffs...mingled in...Neither Carlos nor his music never seems to get old, and both can blend into whatever is current..after a couple of listens, certain melodies stay in your head...Shape Shifter, Dom, Nomad...especially Metatron...
B002RVCD0U|3.0|I know Christian Bale has fans but I am not one of them yet he is in Iconic movies. Honestly I don't know who could play adult john connor but certainly not the guy who wears the rubber suit. The story is good the action good the other actors FREAKING amazing the one Glitch would be how does everyone just shrug off nuclear explosions seriously there are 3 really close proximity explosions and no one is like &#34;Oh Sh8t!&#34; Its like a normal occurance like birds flying. I am not giving anything away either but THREE seriously .. even mini nukes deserve a Wilcox Tango Foxtrot
0316069884|5.0|Fair, but firm, Saffran really leaves no stone unturned. He offers the reader fact and option, allowing us to choose. Anyone that eats should read this book.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I've never had a book like this one touch me so much.  I've read several other books on NDE and they seem so fake compared to this book. It gives you hope and faith in that we have a great God that truely loves us.  He's not just out to send everyone to hell like I was taught as a child.  I also lost a son in a car wreck and this book explained alot of what happens after death of the natural body.  It also explains how our love ones can stay behind to comfort us in our grief.  I had so many signs from my son so I know this is true.  I also know he is truely in a better place and I will see him again.  Thank you so much Betty for sharing your story!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I generally like Denzel movies but I just couldn't get with the program on this one. Too long for one and I wasn't into the subject matter.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|bad movie, dont rent, i fell asleep which is rare for me being a movie fanatic, plus why the hell would you mix a president with vampires
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really enjoyed the series. Great love story. I disagree with all the negative reviews. The book is a great read with highs and lows...kept my attention. I really enjoyed reading Christian's point of view at the end of the book. It gave me a whole different view of him. WONDERFUL!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is very good for all ages and I love playing it , I recommennd this game  to all that love card games !!!!
B002436WJE|5.0|I really wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it was. Liam Neeson is excellent and very believable. There isn't a lot of profanity in this like most action movies, which is always a good thing. There's no explosions, car chases and numerous over-choreographed- just a neat little action-drama movie. Even with the subject matter, I didn't feel that the violence was gratuitous, and it was handled very well. You can't go wrong with this movie.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|Dawes' 3rd album is beautiful and brilliant.<br />Is it possible to add another star to the rating system?<br />It's been a long time since I've heard anyone turn a phrase like Mr. Goldsmith.<br />Young man, old soul.
B000AM2L1O|4.0|My daughter (just over 2 1/2 years) absolutely loves this baby. This got her last summer when she became a big sister. She has named her baby \\"Sweet\\" (because of her sweet smell- truly!) and takes her all over... feeding her, changing her clothes, \\"brushing\\" her teeth at night, tucking her in to her own bed, and so on... doing everything she sees me doing with her younger brother, essentially. I highly recommend this doll. The only negative I can see- is the price... it seems a bit steep to me. For a special occasion, though- this doll would be something special. She certainly is to my daughter. (Note: I also love that she has a soft, cloth body... makes her much easier to carry around, and gives her more ability to bend and be played with as opposed to dolls whose bodies are rubber/plastic and have to be bent at the joints.) This toy will be around for many years!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|In the world of spirituality there are so many ways of expressing, especially since language seems so inadequate at times to express the full spectrum of the magnificence of the Whole, given this, Anita has done a wonderful job of not only documenting her experience, but also in the last section clearly and consistently sharing what she learned through those experiences. the core of my being resonated and felt aligned with what was expressed. With gratitude.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings is a fantasy epic that stretches the boundaries of imagination. Following three major plot lines that are expertly woven together, and numerous side plots, Sanderson fully realizes the world of Roshar.<br /><br />Roshar is a vast, diverse land unlike our own world in so many aspects that it is completely unique. Most of the land is frequently ravaged by ferocious high storms which has forced the land to adapt, and the people even more so. For example, in Roshar, the grass that we know fades into the ground at the slightest movement on the surface. Roshar is a world like our own in that they are at a time of crucial technological innovation and breakthroughs to secrets left from the past. The scientists call these new innovations fabrials, and they can be used in anything from heating, to a sort of email system with pens that transcribe onto sheets of paper that can be thousands of miles away. In Roshar, however, the past may have been more advanced than the present day and scientists work furiously to re-discover the technological advancements from the past. There are multiple races in Roshar, including the Shin of Shinovar, the Alethi of Alethkar, the Thaylens from Thaylenah, and the people of Jah Keved and Kharbranth, among others. Most of the book takes place in Alethkar, which was governed by ten separate princedoms until King Gavilar Kholin united them. After King Gavilar is assassinated under mysterious circumstances, his son Elhokar Kholin becomes king. King Elhokar declares war on the Parshendi, a newly discovered race who are seemingly responsible for the murder of Gavilar. The Alethi armies go to war on the Shattered Plains, fighting the Parshendi in a nearly endless battle.<br /><br />There are three main characters who each have their own separate plot line. Kaladin is a surgeon's son hailing from a small town called Hearthstone. As a war hero he was known as kaladin Stormblessed because of his supposed luck. Now he has been branded a slave, and must find inner peace so that he can once again try to help those around him who are in need of someone to fight for them; something that it seems he is destined to do again and again, until he succeeds, or dies trying. Then there is Dalinar Kholin, a high prince of Alethkar; seemingly the last one to uphold the ancient codes of honor and warfare. Since his brother, Gavilar Kholin, the former king of Alethkar was assassinated, Dalinar has been obsessed with an ancient book called the way of kings, which details the Alethi codes of honor and warfare as well as how a king should rule. This book has been all but outlawed and is shunned by the Alethi lords for its unusual ideals on leadership. As Dalinar also begins to be bombarded by visions during the high storms, he must choose whether or not to heed the persistent message in these increasingly intense visions; \\"unite them!\\" After the death of her father and the subsequent collapse of the Davar House of Jah Keved, the last but not least main character, Shallan Davar, sails to the city of Kharbranth where she hopes to study under the renowned scholar Jasnah Kholin, sister to Gavilar Kholin, the deceased king. However, her motives for seeking out Jasnah are more nefarious then simple scholarly interests as this plan that she has concocted is the last hope for her and her four older brothers to save their house.<br /><br />In a world where ancient evils are stirring and events are unfolding that confuse the people of Roshar, we follow three people who must find themselves, struggle with their inner doubts and emerge stronger for it, so that they may become heroes to help the people of Roshar through devastation. It seems that only by revealing the past, and learning its secrets, will they be able to unlock the future.
B004FEJ3VY|1.0|Very small toy and it does not transform very easily.  To do so caused the toy to break.  So there goes my money straight to the trash can.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|OK, here's your opportunity to revisit Middle Earth, with all its atmospheric glory and excitement.  Enjoyed it well enough.  Not a great fan of dwarves - who is?  Nothing to do for that - the story is about dwarves and one Hobbit, who was thoroughly entertaining.  We also get another chance to meet the elves and white wizard again, who I don't believe appear in the book.  I think it doesn't make any sense to have a trilogy based on this short novel, and I hope the filmmakers don't lose their shirts on these exhorbitant productions.  Not my problem though - I'll spend as much time in Middle Earth as you'll let me!
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|If you can get this for $5, it's like getting the best of the soundtrack.<br />Yes, you could spend $13 on iTunes for all 30 tracks, but most of the other tracks sound like filler, and not like songs.<br />These are the best songs.<br />But if you got cash to burn, buy the deluxe on iTunes, otherwise, for $5 get this!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />So I have been listening to this for the past week, and I did two ways: one with all the tracks, and the other with the shortened playlist.<br />After going back and forth, I really do like the longer version with all 30 tracks better. It flows better and easy to listen to, especially while working on the computer or other reading intensive task.

B006C67NP6|5.0|Bought iREAL b for my wife to put on her Nexus 7.  She plays electric bass.  I played guitar in high school and college and still know a bit about music.  I fooled around with this for a little while and then later watched my wife work with it.  Wish this technology existed when I was actively playing!  Tremendous learning aid.  jh

B0047Y0FGY|1.0|The whole book is written as a conversation/rant in her head. Quite boring and there are made up words all over the book. Not my kind of book.
0394581865|1.0|...and only one received. I expected the full trilogy, and got only book two. Not book one, not book three, just two. So, it's totally useless as I cannot even start the trilogy.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The characters were engaging and the silo concept was unique.  I highly recommend the book.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great movie what can I say. No issues downloading and watching, so I will likely rent again. This was my first time renting from Amazon.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Not only do you have to wait extremely long times, but everything is really expensive, fake money wise and real money wise. And if you do shell out cash for the game, you will not get much results for the cash.

0307277887|3.0|It's okay.... Since I've the TV series, it's not the same.  I keep comparing to the show.  I think it would be better if I would have read this before watching the show.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I have to admit, Depeche Mode never ceases to amaze me with how they have evolved as a band. With over 30 years under their belts, Depeche Mode can still make good, quality music that gets even better with each listen. After I listened to it a few times, I can honestly say that this record is a perfect depiction of Depeche Mode. Delta Machine has copious electronic elements with quality mixing that remind me of past albums as well as new sounds that help define their newest effort. As a true DM fan for over 25 years, I guarantee that you will not be disappointed with the diverse collection of Martin and Dave masterpieces. Dave's vocals are top notch as he proves that he can still sing just as good as he did back in the 80's. Delta Machine is more slow than previous albums, but SOLID and STRONG overall and most definitely worth every penny. I own all 13 of their cd's and I would have to include their newest album in my top 5 favorite DM albums of ALL time.<br /><br />My top 5 favorite DM Albums:<br /><br />1) Violator<br />2) Ultra<br />3) Playing The Angel<br />4) Delta Machine<br />5) Black Celebration

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I can't believe what's missing - the whispersync is a joke, has never worked. You can't upload files in folders, with all of the info you've used Calibre for, so - for example - you have 9 Biggles books, and you read the first 3 - on your Kindle. You up;load all 9 to this and have no idea where you left off.<br /><br />If there was ANY alternative - I'd use it in a flash.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I would sooooooooo recommend this app. It's so fun and addictive, when I don't know what to do I go on my kindle fire hd and play this app. I hope my review is helpful.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|OK, you'll have to be patient with this one.  The development of the plot is rather slow at the beginning, but you'll get sucked in as time goes on. The ending is fitting - don't worry, I won't spoil it for you, but the way Clooney constantly has to watch his back even with the women he interacts with creates a tension that lasts throughout the film. Enjoy!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|i have this game on nintendo ds and now its on kindles!!! i cant wait till it gets done downloading!!!
B000W4KSWO|3.0|I guess it was not due to their music, but rather the change in my taste in music.  I'm sure that other people will love it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|The DVD's were shipped very quickly and as yet, I have not had a chance to see all of them. I have read the Books, and so far, the DVD's are doing a fine job of maintaining the flow.
0385344228|1.0|I give this one star for the author's ability to give life to a courtroom, and the fact that it was definitely a page turner. But I don't know what this author set out to do. A plain old thriller? A psychological thriller? Reminded me of a bad Picoult novel. Her novels are quite contrived. This was too, but at least her novels get you thinking at least a little.<br /><br /> I can't touch on all the flaws because there are so many.  Little character development, especially regarding Jacob. Unbelievable implausibility. And because there was so little depth and continuity in the writing, and so much that was unbelievable but written as though the context was real, it became impossible to explore ideas about \\"What would you do?\\" It's impossible to consider any universal value in the theme here. The author paints everything partially, never fully. So many impossible and unworthy questions regarding Andy's father and his actions, his wife and her actions. Not enough information is given to enable any real exploration, just a sensational and yes, skilled build up to the ending....oh my... the ending left me with absolutely nothing. Only an ugly empty feeling at the end.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a great app & I've even started playing it!  My only gripe is the good stuff on this app cost $$$.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I've been following this show since it aired on CW.  Use to be right after Smallville and was a great combination of shows.  It's come so far since they first starting looking for their Dad to now having to close the gates of hell forever.  I hope this show goes the distance and makes it to 10 seasons.  It would be great to see the show wrap at as a series finally of Sam and Dean growing old and having a normal family life like they have always wanted.  Most likely it will end with them finally stopping all evil but paying for it with their lives and maybe finally meeting God with Castiel.  Crowley needs to get his for sure.  Great bad guy but I think I like the Lucifer charter better.  He was scary but very funny at the same time.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|Expected more from Denzel Washington.  Would not recommend this movie at all.  Impossible for a plane of that configuration to fly inverted for any length of time.  Don't care for movies that glorify drug users.

B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Been following this guy for years. Remember when I first found &#34;for what it's worth&#34; on the radio, and realised that the Beatles had some compatition.  This collection is long over due. Nice booklet, nice design, nice photos, but the best is the music. Like a rose in a fisted glove, ya gotta love this collection. Only wish 12/8 blues (all the same) was on it. If Mr Sills reads this, Thanks! Love the tunes, loved them all along,  ...  thanks.  Chuck

B007JCP8FE|5.0|These guys are great! I met them a couple years ago before a concert- very cool dudes. This album hadn't even been worked on yet, so I was excited when I heard they had a new one. It rocks and is one of my favorites. :)
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is GAME OF THRONES, people! What's not to love? I am so glad one can get the full season in a set - and plan to acquire them all as they come out, too! This series is superb.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|A classic that my kids loved. Made them look at High School from a different perspective for sure. Makes you stop and think a little as well.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|Sometimes I'll be generally enjoying a book, but the author will do something that begins to annoy me. Then every time he does That Thing, I'm a little more annoyed. I become sensitized to it and I begin to worry it like a sore tooth until I can't stand it anymore, and I have to quit reading that book.<br /><br />That's what happened to me with The Life of Pi. In this case, it was lists. A list of swimming pools in France (all but one of which have nothing to do with the story). A list of animals in the zoo. A list of Piscine's classmates. A list of how each animal in the zoo will kill or maim you. List after list after list.<br /><br />I gave up before Pi ended up on the lifeboat with the tiger, which I knew from the movie. I was eager to reach this point in the story, but I found myself entangled in lists and stumbling before I got there.<br /><br />Maybe when I retire and have more time to read, I'll revisit this book. If it's anything like the movie, there's a great story in there somewhere.

1476733953|5.0|Hugh Howey wove an interesting post-apocalyptic world where the nature of mankind continues to reconcile its fears through oppression and violence. I was entertained by Howey's imagination into what it would be like to live in deep subterranean silos. Above ground, our present-day civilization is working hard to prove itself unworthy of inhabiting this beautiful planet called Earth.
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|I was told by friends that is is &#34; the scariest movie they have ever seen &#34;.  Ummm..not true..the story is somewhat interesting but it doesn't explain much and was not scary or suspenseful.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I still love it. The characters have grown and changed and the writing is excellent. Though I was upset at the end.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I first saw this movie with my kids and I think I loved it more than they did!  The monster characters are sooo human, I couldn't stop laughing at certain points because they reminded me of people in my life.  It has a good storyline and teaches a good lesson about friendship and love, and how greed can make people do bad things.  It is just scary enough for little kids to watch while the happy ending smoothes over any anxiety about Boo's scary monster. Watch it on a rainiy day when you can cuddle on the couch with your kids or grandkids.

B00BP3DPJY|5.0|While the influences of Kurt Vile, Father John Misty and Bon Iver are clearly present in this album, Singer-Songwriter Matthew Houck of Phosphorescent has enough imagination to take the listener beyond into some truly original and sweet territory. This is a fantastic track list from start to finish and an early candidate for album of the year.

B004LR5K0I|5.0|This is not the run-of-the-mill Elvis collection.  These discs have tracks that display the raw talent of Elvis, with no &#34;technological enhancements&#34;.  It's wonderful to hear him talk to the members of his group, and to hear him cut-up and laugh when everything doesn't go perfectly.  If you like the &#34;Top-40&#34; stuff that STILL gets plenty of air time on radio stations today, this is not for you.  But, if you truly appreciate the voice, the talent, the person that was Elvis, you cannot miss this!!!  I LOVE IT!

B00BEOYPKW|4.0|Philadelphia's finest Kurt Vile has gone out of his way in the build up to this new release to accentuate his impeccable slacker credentials as a prelude to his fifth solo album \\"Wakin' on A Pretty Daze\\". This reviewer is having none of this propaganda, since at work here is a dogged perfectionist who has over the past five years led the dynamic heartland rock community in the City of Brotherly Love that has orbited around the best band in America bar none \\"The War on Drugs\\". All these musicians have been releasing music like its going out of fashion. Vile in particular seems to relish putting out more eight minute plus songs on this new record than contained on the the average Allman Brothers album thus when he confesses in the title track that \\"I live along a straight line/ Nothing always comes to mine/To be frank, I'm fried /But I don't mind\\" you wonder how much more he would release were he ever to become hyper? It raises the question if this level of prodigious output serves to lower his quality control; happily the answer is an emphatic no. That said for anyone who owns 2011's epic \\"Smoke Ring for My Halo\\" whilst there is no noticeable sharp rupture or break with its illustrious predecessor (\\"KvCrimes\\" would fit on either album), this new records aesthetic does provide a noticeably different approach which emphasises a much more assured and confident songwriter.<br /><br />Starting at the album closer is illustrative, since the ten minute plus \\"Goldtone\\" happily ambles along at a luxurious pace and Vile's polished drawl punctuates it with verses which keep your attention in a loose way throughout its subtly languorous duration. This is good old fashioned A grade stoner rock which spread out over an hour of music and eleven songs cements Vile has one of the best solo acts on the North American continent. Opener \\"Walkin on a pretty day\\" bears a symbiotic relationship to \\"Goldtone\\" in length and is underpinned by that that melodic guitar solo infused rock which Vile and his War on Drugs counterpart Adam Granduciel should take out a full patent upon. This album does indeed veer slightly closer to the vibe of WODs \\"Slave Ambient\\" not least in the synth driven rock of the best song present \\"Was all talk\\" and one of the standout tracks the wonderfully powerful \\"Snowflakes are dancing\\". The impact of this is a less grungy album than \\"Smoke Ring\\" but a stronger set of much brighter pop/rock songs plus some convergence with \\"Air Bud\\" almost sharing the same guitar backdrop as Granduciel's \\"Brothers\\". Throughout the more airy and light infused tracks scream an attempt by Vile to combine his roots rock credentials with a dreamy feast of spacey drone not least in the punchy \\"Shame Chamber\\" and the Tom Petty inspired \\"Pure Pain\\" which will belt out of car audios when the north winds cease blowing. Finally the simple acoustics of \\"Never run way\\" is perfectly pitched and economical in approach.<br /><br />Some will argue that Vile remains an acquired taste for those in need of retro musical fixes that involve a hybrid of Lou Reed crossed with Neil Young. This has lead the Independent in its review to snottily conclude that all this album amounts to is \\"mid-paced alt rock, reminiscent of the Dandy Warhols in a coma\\". This is errant nonsense and sharp pins should be stuck in a copy of the Indy for its lack of taste and foresight. Granted Vile is not a true original but \\"Wakin on A Pretty Daze\\" is a record full of exultation of spirit, songs that grow on every listen and represents real prime steak amongst much of the horse meat burgers of modern rock.ile and his War on Drugs counterpart Adam Granduciel should take out a full patent upon.

0140386335|5.0|Recently, I have been going back and reading the books that inspired the movies I grew up with. This book far exceeded my expectations! I am a kid at heart and a big fan of children's literature, and this book was a wonderful flight of fancy! The story was so infused with vivid imagination, fascinating characters, and a unique plot--I couldn't wait to find out what happened to Fantastica and all its inhabitants. (Although, I must admit I really hoped the story would never end!) Indeed, there are some parts of the book that may be too intense for very little ones, but I honestly can't wait to pass this along to my children when they reach an appropriate age!

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Not much I can add to all the glowing reviews except to say they are deserved. The story is great. No surprise at all to see it has been picked up to be published as a hardcover. It is one I intend to add to my actual bookshelf. Can you give a book a better compliment than that? I think the story is one which goes beyond  the genre and within it is outstanding. I feel like the publishing company saw that potential as well. It is a great read. One I have no hesitation to recommend.

B00BGI076M|2.0|I think this series is the main cause of why my blood pressure is escalating whenever I pay attention to it. I was never fond of Police/Investigation/Crime shows except for a few here and there. My friend insisted this was a good show to watch and don't get me wrong for the first 5 or so episodes it was thrilling and engaging but it doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that the plots just keep dragging on and on and are quite repetitive. In short the fault doesn't lie with the actors but with the plot itself, it's ridiculous even for a TV show.<br /><br />Joe Carrol a former college professor, is well the villain the title \\"The Following\\" is based on his ability to reach out for those unloved/unwanted/outcast civilians who also suffer from a disease called psychopathy or otherwise known in today's pop culture Psycho. He more or less uses these people to form an organization that's going to follow his lead of serial murders, kidnappings, torture and all the inhuman activities ever invented to help him write the greatest novel alive which will be based on the real life of these murders. Not Only that he also chooses Ryan Hardy the former FBI agent who had an affair with Joe Carrol's ex wife and was the reason behind his capture a couple of years ago to be the patroness of this great work of literature that he's preparing. But that's not the point. The Point is the bad people are all intellects, sophisticated, dominating, sneaky and have a good strategy. While the good guys on the other hand, are hopeless and by hopeless I mean they can't do anything to save their lives and as a ramification of that the bad guys keep winning over and over while the good once lose everything.<br /><br />I just got bored, the endless killings of civilians in the name of this literally work while no one's able to catch them in the act is a tad unbelievable. The ability of Joe Carrol to brain wash as many people to join him in his little killing spree is just unrealistic and strange especially when we come to realize he was doing it while he was behind bars through the internet? Seriously! Come Join me in my quest of criminal activties and you'll get a chapter in my upcoming book! Yeah, no one will buy that!<br /><br />The minions are pathetic, losers who killed their (-------) and ran away with it cause the authorities are so dumb to catch them especially when they're already suspects entering a freaking Jail to visit a death row criminal who's responsible for the killing of 14 young girls. Did You get that? He's a mass murder and still gets unlimited jail visit times to interview his minions.<br /><br />Just, don't let me go any further I could go on and on and on about how stupid and impossible this situation would be in real life but I don't think my ramblings will end.<br /><br />Not to mention, he escapes prison again! and his followers fly him through a helicopter don't ask me how they afforded it unless they killed it's passengers to a huge mansion where he'll be crowned as their King. If this was happening in some medieval legend I might have bought that but in the real world in modern times with all this technology?<br /><br />I don't really know what the writers of this show are trying to portray by doing all of this? Is it for the sake of entertainment alone? Cause if it is let me tell you it's quite repetitive. Unless the writers have this hate for the FBI and just want to portray them as useless then fine.

B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|Since Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys announced their reformation at a fan convention in 2005, OMD have enjoyed something of a career renaissance. Reunited along with Martin Cooper and Malcolm Holmes, the classic 4-piece performed their 1981 masterpiece, \\"Architecture & Morality\\", in full for the first time on 2007's highly successful tour. With the synthpop pioneers back in vogue, and with long overdue critical acclaim for the albums created during the band's Imperial phase in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was fresh impetus to deliver some new product, and this eventually materialised in 2010...<br /><br />In truth, McCluskey had been stockpiling material since 1996's \\"Universal\\", the last of a trio of `solo' albums that McCluskey had recorded under the OMD moniker for Virgin Records. \\"History Of Modern\\" was essentially another solo work, with Humphreys committed to other projects (such as his work with partner Claudia Brucken in OneTwo). Disappointingly it was a rather unbalanced affair, with outtakes (\\"Sister Marie Says\\") nestling alongside Atomic Kitten rejects (see the rather strained \\"If You Want It\\") and a smattering of new compositions that had been written by McCluskey after his commitment to other girl acts such as The Genie Queen had lapsed. Significantly, however, Humphreys collaborated with McCluskey on the album's two best cuts - \\"Green\\" (originally demoed by McCluskey in the early 90s) and the enchanting \\"New Holy Ground\\", the track that came the closest to mirroring that classic OMD sound. Fast-forward 3 years and we have 12th album, \\"English Electric\\", with both McCluskey and Humphreys pulling the choral strings...<br /><br />It is OMD's fourth album, \\"Dazzle Ships\\", that provides the blueprint for this lovingly crafted album, with sound tapestries interspersed throughout the assured 12-track set. \\"Please be Seated\\", the first of four sound collages, starts \\"English Electric\\", PA announcement style (with tantalising echoes of \\"Radio Waves\\"and \\"Introducing Radios\\") before the first song proper, \\"Metroland\\", begins its 7-minute-plus synthpop odyssey. Picking up where \\"The Right Side\\" left off on the previous album, it is another unashamed doffing of the cap to Kraftwerk (see \\"Europe Endless\\"). The track (much like The Human League's excellent \\"Night People\\") was cruelly edited and released as the album's first single in March this year. Third track \\"Night Café\\" maintains the momentum, with a teasing intro that evokes their first hit \\"Messages\\", with lyrics inspired by the work of American painter Edward Hopper (who had influenced the sleeve design for 1985's \\"Crush\\") and intriguingly described by Humphreys as \\"Souvenir meets She's Leaving\\".<br /><br />With the previous tracks being steeped so evidently in the past, by contrast, \\"The Future Will Be Silent\\" is a more experimental affair, featuring a whispered vocal from McCluskey, robotic voices, Kraftwerk-like melodic interspersions and even a hint of dubstep, as if to emphasize that the 21st century version of OMD is much more than a nostalgia trip. \\"Helen of Troy\\", a collaboration with Greek act Fotonovella, is more traditional OMD fare, allowing former history student McCluskey to indulge the listener with a semi-sequel to OMD's classic brace of \\"Joan of Arc\\" tracks, with his paean to the mythological Greek warrior (previously immortalized in Icehouse's excellent \\"Trojan Blue\\" from 1982's \\"Primitive Man\\"). Bearing rhythmical similarities to the aforementioned \\"Joan of Arc\\", and containing the duo's trademark choral flourishes, this is classic OMD. Track six, the beautiful \\"Our System\\", continues in the same 'old school' vein; a slow building choral-heavy workout featuring samples of NASA Voyager recordings and some effective cascading drums from Mal Holmes in the coda.<br /><br />While McCluskey's insistence on ostensibly using the previous album to 'clear the decks' rendered the project more OCD than OMD at times, \\"English Electric\\" benefits hugely from its compositions being conceived within a narrower timeframe, making it a far more cohesive affair. The one exception is \\"Kissing The Machine\\", a collaboration with former Kraftwerk meister Karl Bartos that was originally released under the guise of Elektric Music in 1993. Humphreys has transformed the electro ballad, giving it a more uptempo and contemporary sheen; even enlisting the services of partner Claudia Brucken to provide the spoken word vocal mid-song. While many fans have bemoaned the track's inclusion, it does fit the album's retro-modern template. And it's a great song that deserves a wider audience. Fans of Kraftwerk (and indeed this record) would also be advised to check out Karl Bartos's excellent new album, \\"Off The Record\\".<br /><br />It was \\"Decimal\\", another musical mosaic that offered OMD fans their first taste of the new album earlier this year. Playing like a 21st Century \\"Time Zones\\", this curious soundbite perfectly bridges the gap between the previous track and the simply gorgeous ballad \\"Stay With Me\\", which features a rare Humphreys vocal (his first lead on an OMD album since \\"(Forever) Live And Die\\" in 1986). Another single contender.<br /><br />\\"Dresden\\" (wisely chosen as the album's second single) is structurally similar to \\"Sister Marie Says\\" (itself something of a musical cousin of \\"Enola Gay\\"), and further enhances the album's classic OMD status, with its driving bass line and a monstrous synth motif that has the potential to be as ubiquitous as the one that permeates Muse's \\"Starlight\\".<br /><br />Arguably the album's two strangest tracks are reserved for the climax. \\"Atomic Ranch\\", the penultimate track, boasts cacophonous sound effects and, ostensibly, a statement about modern consumerism. The ephemeral - and aptly titled - \\"Final Song\\" is further challenging. Sonically sounding like a revisit of old b-sides \\"Annex\\" and \\"Navigation\\", it features a typically abstract lyric from McCluskey, while some unexpected near-operaticfemale vocals add an unusual flavour to the mix.<br /><br />Thirty-five years since their formation, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark have crafted an album that comfortably nestles alongside the best work created by the core duo of McCluskey and Humphreys. Whilst it sometimes feels a bit clinical in its execution, this is a beautifully produced (and perfectly sequenced) set of songs, with an attention to detail lacking from previous albums. A real surprise in fact. (9/10)

B008GOAES0|3.0|WAITING FOR THE SUN might be evidence that Jim Morrison was either a tapped-out lyric writer (\\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" and \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\") or just totally stoned out of his mind (\\"The Celebration Of The Lizard\\" poetry). But then, we see flashes of the sort of brilliance that permeated the DOORS' first two albums-- tracks like \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" and \\"Five To One\\" stand up against any that this band ever recorded.<br /><br />Musically, WAITING FOR THE SUN often sounds tremendously dated-- perhaps it was outmoded even in 1968. Fuzz guitar and calliope-like organ are everywhere-- there's waltzes (\\"Wintertime Love\\") and schmaltzes (\\"Love Street\\") and all sorts of filler. A pattern of inconsistency established here followed the group right through to [[ASIN:B0028ER4PK L.A. WOMAN]]. The DOORS were a band that the \\"Best Of\\" compilation was ideal for. Like [[ASIN:B000M4PPM2 THE SOFT PARADE]] and [[ASIN:B000K380NG MORRISON HOTEL]], WAITING FOR THE SUN is only for their most devoted fans and perhaps '60s rock completists.<br /><br />SIDE ONE:<br />[2:14] Hello, I Love You<br />[2:53] Love Street<br />[3:56] Not to Touch the Earth<br />[3:22] Summer's Almost Gone<br />[1:54] Wintertime Love<br />[3:25] The Unknown Soldier<br /><br />SIDE TWO:<br />[3:03] Spanish Caravan<br />[3:01] My Wild Love<br />[2:26] We Could Be So Good Together<br />[2:36] Yes, the River Knows<br />[4:26] Five to One<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 33:08

I definitely recommend.
B000VI70WM|4.0|Fans of rock/pop acts from the 1980's New Wave era typically have two avenues for their musical tastes:<br /><br />1. Listen to the old albums, because we really like them and/or because the group is no longer around.<br />2. Listen to the original bands as they continue to create albums.<br /><br />It's this second avenue that is often a sticking point with New Wave fans (heck it is for fans of groups/acts from any particular era). Do you dislike the \\"new sound\\" of your favorite old groups because it's NOT what you fondly remember them being? OR Do you allow your musical tastes to morph along with the few remaining groups who are trying to remain relevant as musical styles and tastes change?<br /><br />Let's face it folks, the music industry is typically targeted to a younger market. If older groups want to sell albums, then they're going to have to be relevant to that market.<br /><br />Some acts from the 1980's were just TOO unique to survive beyond the 1980's: Flock of Seagulls is a good example. However, some groups really had a strong pool of talented musicians and a desire to put their personal issues aside (some times) and keep cranking out music for the ever changing tastes of the music-buying public. Examples include (though not all necessarily specifically from the 1980's) Depeche Mode, Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones, A-HA (yeah, they are still huge in Europe and Latin America with lots of top 10's there), and many more).<br /><br />Duran Duran has suffered at times from personal differences among group members - but jeez, I KNOW I couldn't spend 30 years on a daily basis with my closest friends, so who can blame them.<br /><br />That said, they have continuously cranked out better than fair albums for the past 30 years.<br /><br />Red Carpet Massacre is more than up to par. It's a new, current sound that make require some DD purists to adjust their listening to a more intense and often dark sound. This is the same course that Depeche Mode has taken over their 30 plus years.<br /><br />The title song has a distinctly DD sound, but also you get some sense that you could be listening to the Killers. Other songs have a Franz Ferdinand vibe, while others still even sound a bit like a few Scissor Sisters songs.<br /><br />I'll admit that it took me listening to the album a second time to \\"get it\\", but I find that is the case with most new music from my favorite \\"old\\" groups. I haven't liked a Depeche Mode album at first listening in twenty years, but second listenings I've become nuts about them.<br /><br />Nite Runner is a hip hoppy song, but distinctly Duran Duran as well. In fact, I can't say that there is a single song that I dislike. Do I like some songs more than others? Oh heck yeah. But this is a great album to put in your MP3 player or CD player in the convertible and put the top down.<br /><br />You get a great sense of driving down the Pacific Coast Highway with this as your soundtrack.<br /><br />Get it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|works well, economical use of power, does not load CPU, requies small amount of RAM and looks very good :)
B0081336FO|5.0|I can't believe I didn't start watching this show sooner! I love Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock! Him and Martin Freeman are great together! I can't believe there's only 3 episodes in each season, every episode keeps you intrigued and wanting to see more! I recommend this show to anyone!
B001AFF25W|5.0|Fantastic book to motivate you and get you really thinking about prioritizing tasks in your personal life and at work.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The movie looked absolutely gorgeous most of the time.  The CGI was awkardly apparent during a few scenes.  It tried to put the same focus on religion that the book did, but I don't feel like it had the same effect.  Overall disappointing comparatively but still worth seeing for just a few of the beautiful scenes.
034580404X|3.0|Um..... It's okay, I was actually disappointed. I am a huge fan of historical romance, and thought this might be a nice break of 'old school' and be something new to enjoy..... a different &#34;spice&#34; if you like.... and boy was it rather cayenne-ish! Although, VERY (let me repeat VERY) repetitive, and I actually got 'tired' of the sex scenes and actually considered skipping forward through a few of them just to 'get it over with' and back to the story part of things. It's definitely different than anything I've read thus far.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I was just getting out of college when this really happened and did not know the history of it.  I like non fictio and this is some of the better non fiction thrillers I have seen lately.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This album is really good, can listen to the whole album straight without having to change the song. Must purchase, will not regret.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|This movie should be classified as science fiction.  With that in mind it is an Okay movie  It might scare little kids.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very unusual take on the apocalypse theme. I thought Juliette was one tough cookie!  I thought it was very interesting how people could live in this huge silo all together, but sometimes didn't see each other for months or even years.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Van Morrison has made an enjoyably transition from basic to rock to the blues, with a few side steps along the way.  His talents are obvoios and this 3 CD set is great and showcases 30 years of changing sounds that can appeal to people at all ages.<br /><br />GREAT - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br /><br />Dr. John Hogan CHA CHE CHO<br />HospitalityEducators<br />Hogan Hospitality
B0000714BP|4.0|But the whole time I couldn't believe that Patrick Swayze would play in a movie like this. My whole life I grew up watching him playing &#34;men&#34; characters and then this. But he was my favorite character in the movie, he was so classy!
0385537816|5.0|Yes there was much discussion and snubbing of the nose at this book, but I'd bet my last dollar that those &#34;snubbers&#34; secretly read it!  Then spent the evening fanning themselves!  It was a small peek into relationships many don't have or understand, but in the end would long to have.  Your own imagination is put into action as this relationship evolves.  Two people learn the importance of putting each other first in a relationship.  I think everyone should read these books (men and women).  Keep an open mind and get over the 'bondage' issue - there is so much more going on with these people.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! The graphics are neat, and the gameplay? Even better! This game is so awesome that I played it all day! I got a lot of gems and stuff.
B008X8P8A8|4.0|this is nice spin off from the total war series! of course there's no huge battles but they are fun non the less.
B002C949KE|5.0|I was looking for buying Brainfluence and read one of the comments about Predictably Irrational being by far better read and original. So I of course, I read through the &#34;Look inside&#34; feature of Amazon and ended up buying the book. Thanks, Daniel Hsu, who wrote the review on Brainfluence.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is definitely a Masterpiece!  It's slow paced and one really gets to know and love or hate each character.  It's almost like I lived in that place.
B004TUKNX6|5.0|Loved Red Barchetta and all of the other quality songs. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Rush
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really loved this game.it was not too hard or to easy<br />the only thing about it.  it was to short.I am waiting for the next one. more please.
B0000DK4PO|1.0|I wasn't able to play it after I received it because I was never told it was a disc you couldn't play in standard DVD Players (only European) and when I returned it I didn't get my full refund because I had opened it...which I had to do in order to discover I couldn't watch it!  Waste of money and time.  Totally disappointed.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|one of the best shows on television! i was hooked on the first episode! if you have overactive imagination, DO NOT watch at night! but even then, this show is incredible!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You'd think the unthinkable Alot this book I personally felt like this book will be an all time favourite for me the series was so good but this conclusion was just so perfect
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really like the details and appreciate the honesty.  Should be a school book for kids to learn the truth about hard work and how it pays off.  It would also make them aware that we are under scrutiny always, country and self.
B008476HBM|5.0|Such a delight.  Sorry that I waited 50 years before reading.<br />Would highly recommend to anyone from age 12 to 100.
B000KIRT6A|5.0|This eq works great, it is more than I expected for the price. I would recommend this to a friend
B00BESM14U|5.0|This wasnt even on my radar until I saw an ad on tv the otherday. I m so glad I watched it. It is sooooo good!!! The story line is so unique
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kids love this game. All 3 play it. My son tries to teach me how to play. I can't seem to get my fingers to work fast enough for this game. Lol
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I got this for my Niece and she loves it.  To me, all of Taylor Swifts songs are beginning to sound alike.  However, my niece loves the CD and all her new songs.
B00886XQO0|4.0|Experienced some static (rarely) and cuts off when moving into another room (walls blocking signal) minor issues which can be expected. Great sound quality. Lots of options although you will be using the same settings once you find the ones you like. All around great headset which can be used for multiple purposes!
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|I've listened to the entire album about 7-8 times now, and the best thing I can think of for it is it's \\"good\\".<br /><br />And it is. All of the songs are good. Obvious differences due to band changes, new experimentation with different sounds, and the melodies and vocals are still strong. But it's so obvious that something is \\"missing\\" compared to previous works.<br /><br />In my opinion, this album is lighter and \\"thinner\\" than previous albums. I'd like to hear some different arrangements on some of these pieces to see if they can be improved a bit for a more memorable experience.<br /><br />Nothing real eye catching on this album, but overall, still fun and a good listen. I'm not seeing adding this album among my favorites, though.
0767836324|5.0|Kids needed a new movie the other one was wore out from them watching it so much, must have for you collection.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|For me, this is the album of the year! It's absolutely fantastic with no filler. Ted's vocals and writing input are fresh and welcome. I almost feel as though the post Morse SB has been a bit flat, good, but not great. This on the other hand is excellent!!
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This game is great, very interesting concept and well developed.  The only problem I have run into is that none of the other &#34;worlds&#34; will unlock until I beat the levels I am currently stuck on.  It's been two weeks trying to beat them...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! I have been waiting for it to come out for the kindle fire for 50 years
B007N9FKCY|3.0|The concept is a little too simple and the game play is quite difficult to make this game playable over and over again.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|Very cute little movie. good actors and humor children will appreciate. nice role for Hugh Grant! more appropriate for children than adults.
B0087EACJK|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and really makes you think.  Some of the time limits seem almost impossible to beat, but I love the game.
B00BXKKNFS|4.0|I don't notice many ads anymore.  Simple to get from the apps store and the price is right, it's free.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I am a HALO nerd and have been into the games since they came out.  Was a great addition to the sci fy world of HALO.
0345529057|5.0|This great series has got me reading again. Can't put it down. Hope I can find this somewhere on DVD when I am done reading them all!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My most interesting read of the year.  I'm always fascinated by books that craft a post apocalyptic survival story (The Passage, World War Z, The Road) - and this one is SO interesting.  Nothing supernatural, just human interaction in a survival silo after what appears to be some sort of nuclear war.  I couldn't read this book fast enough and quickly picked up the sequel (Shift) after I finished.  I also love the author's view of things.  Super humble  and appreciative of his success in the Q & A in the back - when asked why his books are so cheap (he actually gave the individual Wool stories away to start) he said it was because he was a nobody.  Can't wait to see what Ridley Scott does with the movie treatment of this book!
B001NLKT60|2.0|This was quite a let down, especially following girl with a dragon tattoo. This story takes a long time to actually get started and has two very unrelated stories. If you are committed to reading the whole series, this book is a must in order to follow character development and story line, but if you are just looking for a casual read, I do not recommend this book.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I loved love loved the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and found the books for both LoTR and the Hobbit to be fulfilling.  Therefore, we were super excited to hear that Peter Jackson would be at the helm of the Hobbit as well, though we were skeptical when we heard he took a children's book and cut it into three films (bolstering the story with materials from other Tolkien works).  We saw the film in the theater opening weekend and it was alright.  Unfortunately, some of the great characters and character interactions and chemistry that were in LoTR were missing with this lot of dwarves and a single hobbit and the story moved a little slow.  Our friend who has read The Hobbit 11 times (!!) was actually offended by some of the extra material, as he thinks The Hobbit is a pretty perfect story.  Peter Jackson also pulled some of what made LoTR great using some of the exact music and lush NZ scenery, but it somehow didn't feel as authentic.<br /><br />We bought the movie in 3D to try it out on a new TV at home and I actually enjoyed it more the second time watching it, maybe because my expectations aren't as high.  I am looking forward to seeing the next two as well - but it's no Lord of the Rings.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The book kept moving at rapid clip. With just the right amount of info to make it believable. I would like a little more info on reacher.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Aside from the movie content being a little slow (like the book), this movie was beautiful in 3D.  The tiger looked a lot more real that I thought he would in CG.  If you liked the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks, you'll probably like this one.  Similar single man surviving incredible odds in tough/life threatening environment type of story.  But this one has a pretty tiger instead of Wilson.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderfully put together Collins has quite the imagination and does an excellent job putting it down on paper and keeping us reading
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Having played the first one, I was worried that this might have the same problems. thankfully it is an improvement to the original!
B00B23O96A|4.0|Great sessions on this one...still wishing he'd wail like the old days, but he still brings out the emotion in every track.
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|As I sit here writing this review RHYE is softly singing and playing into My ears and I am LOST in their Music. It's Beautiful, Sensual, Passionate, Deep, Soft, Relaxing, Heartfelt and Oh, So SEXY. RHYE has truly created some Awesome Music to take you away to another World and the title of the CD is EPIC. 'WOMAN!' I LOVE It! Make sure that You grab a copy of this CD and find out what I am talking about. RHYE...You Guys are Genius...<br /><br />-PM Bishop
B005YVPSDY|2.0|Except for the music by Keith Emerson, this film is terrible.  It does not even approximate the quality of 1950s saturday matinee fare.  The script is sparse and the actors are wooden.  They sounded like they were reading the script for the first time.  Emerson's music is interesting but it does not sufficiently elevate the film.  Even the blood is the wrong color.  It is a filmed horror parody without the humor and with no substantial plot.  I do not understand how this film was rated so highly by others unless they have a financial or fanatical interest.  Skip it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book. It read as if it had been written by a child who just imagines what this type of interaction would be like, not by an adult who has lived life. I can't believe it was a best seller! We readers deserve much more than this garbage.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I've grown tired and cynical watching the carefully positive documentaries by and about other rock groups, and IMNSHO this is a huge exception.  This is no \\"Behind The Music\\". Given Don Henley's attitudes about gossip for its own sake, put forth in \\"Dirty Laundry\\", I didn't expect nor did I want the lowdown on the drugs or the romantic escapades. The documentary is as well produced as any Eagle album and the fact that the band members waited until they are sixty-somethings shows. The early parts of the story give deserved and welcome credit to Jackson Browne (mentoring Glenn Frey) and Bob Seeger (who mentored Don Henley), and to Linda Ronstadt for giving \\"Desperado\\" and the whole group the push they needed to get out in front of us and begin to be who they became.  Maybe the best indication of how good this is is the calm, reflective, informative participation of Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon and the unfortunate Don Felder.<br />Lennon/McCartney, Jagger/Richards, Waters/Gilmour, Henley/Frey, Take your pick.
B00BF2UKDE|5.0|great album. starts off slow but drags you in and is more addictive with each listen. Nick and the boys never disappoint
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I really love this case, it's durable and protects my Kindle Fire well. I also love how it can revolve and give me different angle options. Well worth the money spent. I would have preferred blue, but the purple is ok. :)
B000W9EOEC|5.0|So a lot has been written about Alive 2007 and I think the main point that needs to be covered when discussing this album is that each song will contain crowd noise/reaction/cheers. Also this album is enjoyable to any person that enjoyed DJ mixes, but already being a fan of Daft punk will make listening to this album more enjoyable because you can compare the original songs to the remixes/mashups. I don't think this should be the first thing you listen if you've never listened to daft punk. But for me personally it is a near perfect electronica album and live album.
B008M721MS|4.0|a little bit confusing the first time around , but after clicking on ALL the icons and their respective menus , was able to set &#34; auto sign in , contact listing , answer all calls automatically , etc.. just have to check ( unclick the camera icon ) for KINDLE camera to work.....nice picture to and from kindle and sound is great
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved the story line.  The character Anastasia is most interesting and I was anxious to know how things would turn out for her.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game you have to have patience and I like that has no ending. I have just started and believe I will be playing for a long time.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I love this movie.  Watching this movie helped me to realize that deep inside is a very sick person.  Not really, but I thought more should have been done to these people who kidnap your daughter.  You're already killing people.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|The new cable did not help with the issue of my Kindle not charging.  I still only rarely get it to take a full charge.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Few films made the impact that `Zero Dark Thirty' did last year.  Not only was it critically lauded (and almost swept early critics' awards, gaining early momentum for Oscar) but the controversy surrounding the treatment of certain themes and aspects of the film (mainly the torture in interrogation) made it a popular water cooler topic, and while the film would up scoring low with Oscar (a mere 5 nominations and only 1 win) it certainly deserved the attention it garnered and stands up as one of the best films of last year.<br /><br />Bigelow, who reignited her career with 2009's `The Hurt Locker' (winning a slew of Oscars, including one for Bigelow as director) tackles `the greatest manhunt in history' with the same nerve-racking intensity she brought to her previous effort, this time with even greater effect.  Each frame moves at a pace that allows the audience to engage directly with the atmosphere of the scene and as the scenes bleed into one another we are brought on Maya's journey into a world that constantly fights at her every push.<br /><br />`Zero Dark Thirty' covers the nearly ten year persistence on the part of Maya, a CIA operative who made it her life to track down and kill Osama Bin Laden.  Starting shortly after the tragic events of 9/11, Maya is sent to spearhead the investigation in Al Qaeda, and she does so with a ferocity that ultimately helps her reach her goal.  She is accompanied on this journey by others who aid her mission, but in the end it is her constant push that gets her where she needs to be.<br /><br />This is Bigelow's movie.  She directs it with the perfect blend of restraint and intensity.  Personally, the weakest link to this film is the performance from Jessica Chastain, who just couldn't handle the character.  I'm glad she didn't win the Oscar for this, because she fails to fully develop the woman.  I understand that the character us more of a cypher to begin with, but there was opportunity to flesh out a burgeoning passion in her eyes.  Instead, Chastain comes across very forced in her moments of conviction.  She can stare off to the side very well, but when it comes to yelling about what she wants and angrily writing on her bosses window, she comes off like a mere pretender.  The supporting cast is marvelous though.  Jason Clarke is remarkably restrained as Dan, the chief administrator of the torturous tactics, and Jennifer Ehle is so beautifully composed and natural as Jessica.  I also loved what Kyle Chandler was able to do with his character, making him feel like far more than a hot-headed boss.  It was also really cool to see Harold Perrineau in the film.<br /><br />At the end of the day, `Zero Dark Thirty' lives up to much of the hype.  It is a powerfully engrossing film that takes a piece of history and gives it the respect and attention it deserves.  It is in no way exploitive or tacky, but wholly realized and extremely moving.r eyes.  Instead, Chastain comes across very forced in her moments of conviction.

0765325950|3.0|I'm in the strange position of being both a fan of the Wheel of Time while also sympathizing with the complaints of detractors. While remaining, book after book, emotionally invested in the core group of characters and appreciating Jordan's acute storytelling, some things have to be acknowledged. It was too long. There were too many characters and storylines, and too many scenes inched along to the point of rendering the reader comatose.<br /><br />In hindsight, then, it shouldn't have been surprising that the chickens came home to roost in \\"A Memory of Light.\\" Key characters that we've gotten to know and love were killed off with hardly a backward glance, whereas the reunions of those who did survive were emotionally flat. Steven Erickson's mammoth \\"Malazan\\" series suffered a similar problem. When you build a big, bloated machine like this, the individual components inevitably get sold short in the end.<br /><br />Throughout the series, I often wondered about the contradiction between the \\"endless turning of the Wheel of Time\\" and \\"The Last Battle.\\" That contradiction is not resolved in a coherent or satisfying manner. I also didn't care for the bargain-basement philosophizing between Rand and the Dark One. Most elementary-school graduates understand that good loses all meaning in the absence of evil, while life loses all interest in the absence of conflict. Surely the Dragon Reborn, with everything he's experienced and endured, and a supernatural being who has existed since the dawn of Creation can do better than this.<br /><br />I don't blame Brandon Sanderson. I think, in many ways, he was given an impossible task. Outside of certain inconsistencies in character (Cadsuane exhibits a certain fallible uncertainty under BS that she never did under RJ; Aviendha felt a little off, too), I think he did as good a job as anyone could expect. I noticed some people on here have complained about inconsistencies with Demandred. Personally, throughout the series, the Forsaken appeared in such a haphazard, fragmented fashion that -- outside of who was male and who was female -- I could hardly tell them apart. My clearest memory of Demandred is from the opening scene in \\"The Lord of Chaos,\\" eight books ago, and what does it say about the series overall that my favorite individual book is still \\"The Shadow Rising?\\"<br /><br />In any event, the eternal down side is we'll never know what might've happened if Robert Jordan hadn't fallen ill. Like all great storytellers, he found a way to keep it together despite the flaws. However, after reading Jordan's 11 and Sanderson's 3, one thing seems certain. If Jordan had lived, we would've been fortunate if he'd wrapped it up by Book 20.n appeared in such a haphazard, fragmented fashion that -- outside of who was male and who was female -- I could hardly tell them apart.

B00338QENI|4.0|Skloot persevered and was able to capture one of the most iconic global science and history stories. The Lacks family will capture your attention & open your eyes!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Alot of different lines going on. This book is pretty epic. The part I like best about his writing is he isn't afraid to kill off a major player and add a new one! Way more than in the tv show, though the tv dhow is good even though it was shortened. You can tell the writer was involved in that too.
B000SLP4SE|3.0|I enjoyed it.  Yes, many of the technical aspects of how things work in this movie are either fictional or not exactly correct but the film was a great thrill ride.  You have to give Wahlberg credit for that.  He seems to always appropriately provide that dynamic in action films.  While I may not be able to determine if he successfully represents an ex-recon scout sniper, I can honestly say that it doesn't matter.  I think that he accurately captures that disillusioned former service member just trying to lead a new life.  One of the most pleasant surprises of the film is the inclusion of Kate Mara as his spotter's widowed wife.  She also does a great job and as a tough beautiful heroine, she joins the privileged few who have gained entry into that tiny click of actresses who you know you want beside you in a fictional apocalypse.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down! The diary entries made this book! I couldn't wait to get to each passing entry to get more details about Amy and Nick.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Spoiler alert! My daughter and I were bummed by the killing off of 2 main characters but we absolutely LOVE the series! Cannot wait for season 4!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun and more challenging than you would expect. Great little game that's just easy to pick up and put down.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|This is a great movie and the blu-ray looks great.  The added footage helps with the story versus the theater cut.
B009KHCT94|3.0|Has an over the top satirical message comparing a putative Sara Palin Presidency with putative Space Nazis.  There are some broad political jokes poking The Indians, the North Koreans and the whole world by turns, some are even funny.  Not up to Dr Strangelove, but a reasonable attempt for the Finns.  They have lots of Nordics to play Nazis, and apparently a lot of American expats.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is a great cd - loved just about all of the songs and Fun is now my favorite new band.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I liked it and read the last book in a rush. Good characters and I can still hear the mockingjays.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This adapter works well in converting older power connections to the new small form factor.  I wish this was included with the new apple products but for not much money it helps you to use older equipment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is addictive it doesn't lag good graphics and is really fun i would recommend this to all people
B004EPYZUI|3.0|The visuals in this movie are amazing which makes the overall story such a shame.  Very depressing and creepy.  As far as the DVD - looks great - no complaints on that part but I would caution people about the movie content itself before buying.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Most favorite show of all time! Whole BluRay set was dirt cheap, arrived in 2 days, and is an amazing product.
0765325950|5.0|I have been waiting a long time to complete this series. It has kept me engaged from the very first book. I was a little disapointed in the battle scene with the dark one and really was confused on the ending. It was not what I had expected, but i guess that is what makes this book such a good read it always has a twist that keeps you turning the page.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We were hooked on Season 1. Watched Season 2 on Prime. Had to buy season 3. Great series and is primarily a soap opera with great costumes and cars.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|The Jack Reacher books are just the best!!!! I've read all 16 of them plus the 2 short stores(which should be read first). I can't wait until Lee Child's next one.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I found the book very hard to get into at first, it was like small-town gossip.  I enjoyed the Harry Potter books, but found this one very depressing.  I was a disappointed reader.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I like lawyer novels.  I enjoyed this story set in Chicago. Overworked underling leaves and makes good on his own. How can you not like it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Hey it's the Bible, there isn't anything better. Kindle version is fairly easy to navigate and somewhat user friendly to use.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|I bought this album for my husband and he loves it. He has said that it's a perfect mix of all of the different stages of Bad Religion throughout the years.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|If your a fan of Rock! You will love this record! Great collaborations, a must have for any Grohl fans
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This little ap does everything a calculator does - and keeps track of each keystroke, too!  Full screen.  IT'S PERFECT!
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Very nice graphics and audio.<br />Game play is fluid and addictive for puzzle lovers.<br />From the 3rd stage it becomes pretty difficult to get gold medals but still lots of fun.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Received my order in great time and the disks are awesome. I was very happy with buying this collector dvd set.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|fast delivery<br />high quality great product<br />great price<br />quick and easy communication with the seller<br /><br />Would buy from this seller again!
B00BI745AA|5.0|I am not  a fan of musicals but this movie made me a fan of musicals I loved it so much I watched it twice
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story was enthralling. You couldn't help but feel for the characters. My heart ached when I got to the end. Brilliant book. I love the trilogy. Very well written.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|i  would like it more if  i  could play it without paying  it  says  free  download  then  you cant  play anymore  unless you make a purchase

B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a fun movie and when I stick this disc in my player it works so i can watch this movie and have fun.
B001IF277K|5.0|Nothing more I want from a battery than it to work, and this has for at least half a year now, I think, with no signs of diminishing strength.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This book was a good read because I do enjoy Apple products and follow the tech industry pretty close.  Love him or hate him, Jobs was a unique individual that was instrumental in changing industries.  This book takes you from his parents, all the way to his battle with cancer. I felt that a lot of the things that I had read here, I had read or heard somewhere else before.  There was more insight as to what kind of a person he really was. Usually you'd just read that he was an a-hole.  The author doesn't write this book in any way that will blow your mind, but like I said, it was a good read.  A must if you like Apple, technology, or history.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I ordered the cd so my daughter and I could learn some of the songs before his concert which we had tickets for. We both feel in love with every song. He is amazingly talented and wrote or co wrote most of the songs. Side note he is awesome in concert don't miss out if he happens to come to your town.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|Great Film, wonderful references and awesome new rendition of Homer's The Odyssey. Very comical and John Turturro is very funny in this film.
1451696191|5.0|Bought for a birthday present.  The Girl isn't done reading it yet, but she's loving it.  And I love that she's reading!
B0091THRCU|5.0|Every one with a slick style preference Should get one of these. It is a great product very protective and only bad thing is it made my screen protector black lol
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I watch this movie every year!  I'm VERY happy to now own it!  Sweet and Funny!  Would recommend for anyone who loves Christmas and it's a great gift idea!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I  just watched this documentary.  A copy loaned out to patrons from the local library, and also available from the online rental places--this was incredible!!!  I highly recommend it.  There were a few expletives-NOT-deleted, so very young children may want to be supervised while watching it with their folks, but its nothing any 12-year-old in school doesn't hear everyday.  I loved this story, and the negative reviews are wrong, no where in this film is a narrator saying that Rodriguez' music was the sole reason apartheid demonstrators were finally able to mobilize their revolution.  The only thing left unanswered in my mind was the difference between Jesus & Sixto Rodriguez--were they brothers?--father and son?  But in the end Sixto was the talent, so this was a very heartwarming documentary that crosses several world cultures to lead us to an understanding: that this is a rare story of human resilience!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|- my other alarm for my kindle was acting up and i really needed a new one because i need &amp; like to wake up early for school.  so i came across this app &amp; its wonderful and awesome i love it.  i thought i wasnt gonna alarm but it did Thank God :D
B00000JNO1|5.0|Love this, Skynyrd never dies and will be around forever as far as I'm concerned.  You can't go wrong with this product.
B00BGIC170|5.0|Wow! I would be hard pressed to find someone near their 40's who couldn't relate to this movie!  I actually enjoyed the unrated version because the characters actually say out loud what the rest of us are thinking in our heads about life, relationships, kids, and family.  It makes me laugh so hard even though I don't usually enjoy vulgar films.  But the vulgarity in this movie really does make it funny.  It's one of those movies that made me think, &#34;Phew!  I'm not alone in feeling crazy sometimes!&#34;
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Good read, the story moves along a good clip.  Glad to see that Will Robie has a new book coming later this month.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Easily one of the best shows to air on TV. Pilot starts off with strong characters and a great plot that keeps you coming back to find more.
0739378481|5.0|Same reply as the previous two.  If I did not like Lee Child then I would not be filling this out!
B005LAIIJY|2.0|I've never been a fan of Quentin Tarantino; yes, would-be cinema snobs, I just don't get it. I don't see how incredibly (needlessly) violent teenage fantasies are art- and this man calls himself a genius! When Gertrude Stein did that we all rolled our eyes, but QT gets away with it? I see no difference between the man and a silly 12 year old student of mine who started signing his homework and tests \\"Quentin\\" - both are adolescent boys awash in pubescent fantasy. Only \\"Quentin Murphy\\" outgrew that phase.<br />These fantasy adjustment of history films make me visibly wince. Why do we need them? Are we all that stupid that we can't learn from our mistakes, however horrendous they are? I hated \\"inglorious basterds\\" and I hated \\"django unchained\\", thinking they would have been better off in the imagination of \\"Quentin Murphy\\".<br />The films go on way too long, especially Django. Almost 3 hours to get to the inevitable denouement? How much do you have to be up your own backside to think this is good film-making? Yes, the acting is superb- QT has given us the amazing Christoph Walz, lest we forget the courageous and brilliant job Samuel L Jackson does with his \\"Uncle Tom\\" character. (and total props to Kerry Washington for her German!) But the script remains a mess, and the plot wholly implausible, embarrassingly so. Especially when you know how slave rebellions ended in reality - do you think crap like this does anyone proud? Tarantino, when they say \\"be the change the world needs\\", this is not what they mean.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Joe Abercrombie's series (6 books so far) have been consistently excellent. With Red Country, he has masterfully blended aspects of western thrillers into his world. Considering that this follows on the heels of The Heroes, which had echoes of C.S Forester thrillers like 'The Gun' and 'The Ship', Abercrombie is redefining and renewing the fantasy genre. To illustrate this point, GRR Martin's 'Game of Thrones' series are a standout series of fantasy books. Abercrombie's books are better than GRRM - so good that they should almost be in a genre of their own<br />Can be easily read as a standalone, but if you are aware of characters from previous novels, it further deepens the enjoyment.<br />I can hardly wait for the next one - write faster, Joe!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was previously unaware of this part of American history and the author did a great job of drawing me in and making me live the characters.  Definitely recommend.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Even more intense than the first book, it kept me wanting to read more every minute! A very quick read and always exciting!
1416550550|5.0|I actually &#34;read&#34; this book as an Audible book.  It made such an impression on my that I wanted to share it with my Mother-In-Law.  She would rather read a physical book, rather than an ebook or listen to a book on Audible, so I ordered this book for her, and she said she couldn't put it down.  This is a very good story plot, and has some very interesting twists.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I started this book I was not sure that it was for me. Well, it only took me like 4-5 days to get through the book, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. I cried, laughed, and got angry at this book multiple times, but that's what made it great.  Well written and pulls on the heartstrings.
B000002JSP|5.0|Love this cd used to listen to it all the time when I was younger in cassette form of course lol. Anyways had been looking for it for a while but could never seem to find it in stores. Thank God I thought of looking on Amazon! It was inexpensive plus I even got a free download of it for my phone! Yes!!! Now I can listen to it wherever I go. Amazon you rock! Lol<br />Thank you<br />Lisa
B001BANK32|5.0|This is a great book, I'd forgotten how much different it was from the movie, and that I shouldn't read it while staying in a hotel....LOL
B005KR6NJU|5.0|My order arrived one week ago but I only had the time to open the disc set today.<br /><br />I was enjoying the cartoons until I noticed that I was missing episodes from Season 1 that I remembered watching on Cartoon Network.<br /><br />Only then did I realise that the box in which the set came in only had 1 disc (Disc Three). The set is supposed to come with 3 discs but there was only a slot for 1 disc with Disc 1 and 2 missing completely from the set. The box also did not have a sleeve which came with Seasons 2, 3 and 4 which I ordered at the same time.<br /><br />I have asked Amazon for an exchange and hope that the replacement comes with all three discs in the box. In the meantime, I am only awarding 1 star due to the defective set I received.<br /><br />*UPDATE* just received a replacement set from Amazon. All 3 discs are there and the box has a proper sleeve. Was also advised that I can keep the original defective set without having to return it by post. Absolutely satisfied with my order. Amended to 5 stars!
B008OOYALE|2.0|Is a great game but the kindle doesn't run it good. It will freeze and don't let you visit some people. It will stop working every 3 minutes, and It doesn't have the same things than the apple version.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I play some but not one of my favorite.  personal choice others might like it for being fast pace that is what I do not like.
B0034G4P9E|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 4.5 / 5<br />video- 4 / 5<br />audio- 4.5 / 5<br /><br />you have to like grain to like this movie,very grainy, but a great movie.<br />recommended purchase.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I spent two days with this book and got nothing else done; I couldn't put it down until I knew how the story would end. Jodi Picoult  books are always sure to please.

B000XSYOVU|5.0|Dr. Forward has long been an insightful writer who relates well to the reader.  Her observations, research and experience are written in plain English and easy to understand!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 5 / 5<br />video- 5 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br /><br />mr. spielberg has done it again.<br />super stuff all the way around, worth the double dip.<br />you simply can't go wrong with this purchase.<br />need i say more... get it !!!!!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I thought the beginning of the book was poorly written when author was describing his life growing up. It seemed after getting about a quarter way through he hired a writer to take over and it seemed to be written better.<br /><br />I thought it was a nice touch having Chris's wife giving her side of the story through out the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed hearing his story and description of the battles he was in.  He was a great American and will be sorely missed.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 5 / 5<br />video- 5 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br /><br />great great great blu ray transfer.<br />a must have...
B00AREIAI8|1.0|very boring do not download all u do is brush the horse and u haft tobwait ten mins in between and u never win shows unless u buy tack which usually cost gems and gems cost real money
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed this book with its artful style of storytelling.  Because the narrator knew the ending, the journey through the details became safe, even though the story was painful.  Interesting story with surprises and well developed characters.  I will seek out another Landay book to read.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game to play and compete with a buddy at home. Wonderful graphics and sounds. Great with HD kindle! Try it out
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've been looking for a sharpener that doesn't require a workbench to use. This one is great. I've used it to sharpen every knife I own, the bladed tools in my Leatherman and several pairs of scissors.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addicted!!! This is a great game! I'm glad I downloaded it. I do with that is I bought something on my Kindle it could transfer to other devices I play the game on like my iPhone.
B007ZFZI8C|5.0|I'm a fan of Melanie C's work in pop and dance music. But I'm also a fan of broadway and classic tunes. At first I did a double take and said \\"what the hell is she thinking.\\" No, she does not have the best range. She is nowhere near the best singer in this category of music. But you know what? She knows her limitations and does not try to go beyond her abilities. It works, and I think really well. I can't stop playing this album. Melanie, you're the best and I hope to hear you cross genres more often.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|my husband order this he loves to listen to the moody blue. yes he would recommend it to his family and friends
B005XLN97M|4.0|The beach house is real cute, but flimsy. Reason for my 4 rating. Bright colors and cute graphics. I don't know how long it will last with young children playing with it.  I'll be using it just for show, so the house will be fine.  Wouldn't have been as happy if I hadn't gotten a good price. Comes disassembled, but was fairly easy to put together. Plenty of room for Barbie and her friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game if you just have a couple minutes to play or want to play for an hour. Its easy and mindless entertainment.
B00338QELU|4.0|I thought it was a great book. The early chapters don't seem to belong to the books title, you have to get a little further in for the title to pertain to the story.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS APP. IT PUTS HIM TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT.  THE RAIN STORM SOUNDS SO INTENSE AND SO REAL.  THANKS FOR MAKING THIS FREE.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|This is a fantastic set from my current favorite Lego theme, The Lord of the Rings.  I think it's great that kids are able to have a Lego theme from such an iconic literary and film classic.  As with all Lego sets, the pieces are of the very highest quality and will last for YEARS of play.  The set contains both \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" guys, so it's really a great option for kids who are looking to stage a battle right out of the box.  I highly recommend this set, along with the rest of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit lines from Lego!
0783240287|5.0|One of the best Broadway musicals of all time. Donny Osmond was superb and the whole cast was excellent. love it.
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|In keeping with the high quality Criterion provides all of the films they transfer, this release is consistent with that strong reputation.  Considered one of Kurosawa's masterpieces and a groundbreaking film in terms of its narrative strategy, this Criterion release provides viewers with an excellent visual rendition of the film along with a wealth of extra material that enhances the experience for those who want to study the fil  more closely.
B00005NGAL|5.0|One of the best Broadway musicals of all time. Good music, superb dancing and super hot women in skin tight cat costumes...
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great little retro shooter that has enough variety to not get boring. I love the pixelated-style graphics and explosions. It feels like a mix of modern gaming and old school style. Very nice
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|The iconic and great late Roger Ebert expressed in his review of The Impossible that he had felt the re-creation of the Tsunami in Clint Eastwood's \\"Hereafter\\" could never be surpassed. He changed his mind after screening The Impossible.<br /><br />Horrifying, overwhelming and in it's own right magnificent the effects of one of the worst natural catastrophes in history is so real, so exceptional that you'll find it hard to breath during the sequence of when the Tsunami hits Thailand.<br /><br />Director Juan Antonio Bayona creates a searing visual and sweeping movie free of cliche' and manipulative shock value. The Impossible has far less to do with the tragedy of the Tsunami and everything to do with it's aftermath as seen through the eyes of one family who survived it.<br /><br />Naomi Watts it's fearless and much of the film is carried by her along with an exceptional performance of the oldest son Lucas played by young actor Tom Holland. A boy thrust into the terrifying role of care taker, protector and the chemistry between Watts and Holland is electric.<br /><br />A solid cast all around, Ewan Mcgregor as the husband and father Henry is deeply quiet and complex as he searches with unrelenting determination for his family. The Impossible - is brimming with small moments of profound beauty, they unfold with ease, free of grandstanding and like a memory are over almost as soon as you witness them but they linger - this is the stuff of great story telling and superb movie making.<br /><br />\\"The Impossible\\" is not of a disaster film it's a reflection of the human heart, the unexpected gift of kindness from strangers - and above all, the power of love and the steel like tenacity of the human spirit.
B009AMANH4|5.0|The blue ray looks fine  the film is excellent and I couldn't say enough good things about Mr. Day-Lewis's performance.....he is always excellent but in this the subject matter and the talent of the actor, writer, director really came together.  Not that he hasn't found this in the past - he has excellent taste in directors - especially his three films with Jim Sheridan.
B000JMKO3C|4.0|I thought at first that this book was just some philosophical nonsense. But it did prove to be pretty inspiration.
B00594XOZU|5.0|While I love having this app on my phone I was hoping to use in on my kindle fire. But it doesn't even come up as an option. What's up with that?
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought that this was a very well written addition to the first book but was a little more forced to tie everything together. Its still amazing and draws the reader in to find out what is going to happen next and to whom and why is this happening! So if you have to ask yourself do I want to read this? The answer is absolutely yes! Can't wait to read the next book!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed this.  It was just a little long, but that made it more enjoyable, because I was eager to resume.  Graphics,, I thought were excellent .<br /><br />Glitter
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Huge improvement over Hungry Shark 1 & 2.  Better graphics, improved gameplay, different sharks.  5 stars.  Get it, you won't regret it.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Kind of cheesy and kid oriented. Long drawn out useless scenes, like when the dwarvws arrive and eat and eat and eat......and little excitment. Only first part too...no goblin march or large scale battles.
B004NROYUI|4.0|This is a terrific case just as described; however please remember to keep one thing in mind...<br /><br />It will only fit the camera as is, in other words even a filter will have an impact on the cases ability to close completely as designed. As such forget a lens hood etc.
B004HMQ7BI|5.0|Clean wholsome entertainment not new but still delightful.wife and I watched it we are going to Italy nice travel movie.
0865478007|5.0|Should be required reading. This was not propaganda, it was scientific facts and research. It was a little drawn out and in some parts redundant, but the author did his research and states the facts. I already thought twice about medications for my family and myself, and now see how truly important that is.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|We will all be a patient one day and Ben lays out the problems that we will face without our ever knowing it. Learn about it here before it is your turn....
1616550414|5.0|This book met and exceeded expectations. I'm a huge fan of the series so I ordered the book on the premise that I love all things Zelda :) I was pleasantly surprised at the low cost of such a generous book. Tons of backstory, illustrations and factoids that brought back feelings of nostalgia. Definitely one of my favorite purchases from Amazon.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|AMC blessed us with a few more episodes than the previous 2 seasons, but unfortunately the momentum stalled.  They could have squeezed the last 4 episodes into 1 and it would have been just as effective.  Still love it though.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|I love this movie. The story is so outrageous you have to love it.  A convention of gangs going badly. NO way! I love the clothing. Every one is dressed like a bad music video. I was very young when I watched this film and thought that New York had to be the most dangerous city in the world.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|This book is life altering!  A MUST read for parents, teachers, coaches, managers, CEO's....compelling information that will change the way you think about developing successful individuals - you will want copies of this to give to everyone you know! Fantastic!
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Poor Ethan.  Why he has been reduced to this I will never know.  He is such a great actor...sad. You could do worse if you are bored.  You will know the whole story in the first 30 minutes.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|I rated this book 2 stars because it all seemed pretty ridiculous. I am aware it is fiction, but it all felt super cheesy.
B00BVVA138|5.0|I have to say I was disappointed when Howard left because I like his albums much better than the first 2 from KSE with Jesse.<br /><br />However Disarm the Descent has turned into one of my favorite Killswitch albums. Vocally, Jesse has come a long way and the melodic hooks we all love KSE for are definitely up to par with Howard, and some may like his style better. This album is top notch KSE that we all come to expect from them whether it's Howard or Jesse singing. If you like Howard better, fair enough. But give the record a chance and you shouldn't be disappointed. I have a new respect for Jesse.<br /><br />And as always the musicianship, drums, riffage, are top notch. My personal favorite tracks are Beyond the Flames, You Don't Bleed for Me, and Time Will Not Remain.
B008602KQI|2.0|I was talked into reading the books and then seeing the movie.  I just don't get it.  I don't understand why this is considered so wonderful.  The author is not very good at building suspense and creating characters that the reader (in this case the audience) can relate to on any level.<br /><br />I realize it's told in a different time in the supposed future, but the characters are not really likeable, nor well developed.  Maybe if we spent more time really getting to know their motivations better and find a way to relate to their situation it would be compelling, but it's just not.  The movie follows the book very closely, which actually might be why I found it so boring and the characters uninteresting.  I think that if they'd gone with using the book as a spring board for something slightly more creative, then the movie could have benn a lot better.<br /><br />Instead, they followed the book as if it were the script and this is why it fails.  The book was a mere shell--so a movie based on the book follows suit.  There were some really interesting ideas, but in both genres they just never feel fully developed.  It's too bad.  The premise was interesting.<br /><br />I realize I'm in the minority, but that's just my opinion.
B00A77II0U|5.0|10 out 10. This game is sooo good.I can't explain its amazingness. It's even too cheap for how great it is. It should be like five bucks. And  the graphics are amazing and not too cartoony for an app. Five star. THIS GAME IS SOOOO GOOD AND HAS GREAT SUSPENSE .
0345803485|5.0|Haha what can I say that hasn't already been said.  Sexy, raunchy.. but yet, I can't put it down! A+!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it works beautiful I have no problem with it and I'm glad that I got it thank you again and I'll talk to you later with some other apps....
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great movie, really enjoyed seeing the story about the 13th amendment and how it all came together and what role everyone played in it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game and I like alot of other like temple run and stick run and other stuff call of duty.
B00B0FQ8NC|5.0|I saw this video at a friend's house.  It's their best songs, from when they where at their best, with the best line-up, while metal ruled.  The crappy thing is i pre-ordered the DVD from Amazon months ago but it still has not arrived.  So my suggestion is to buy the DVD, because it is awesome.  But don't buy it from Amazon because you'll be waiting forever, while your friends will already have it...
B004G6TD8Y|5.0|This is an excellent re-work of music.  It is a way to get people to expand their taste is music.  I myself, started listening to more classical pieces after hearing this album.  These are three very talented musicians and do an excellent job with this classic collection.<br /><br />Unlike the reviewer a few down, I like \\"Sir\\" Paul McCartny as he is a very good song writer with a few exceptions like \\"Temporary Secretary\\", but I am not a fanatic.  However, Emerson, Lake and Palmer are far superior as they are better musicians as well as being very good song writers.  They produce a lot of music for just three people in the band, even during live performances such as this one.<br /><br />Thank you.
0307887448|5.0|I bought this book for my husband and read it when he finished. I was pleasantly surprised on how great the story is. It really pulls you in. I finished reading in one weekend because I was enthralled. If you are a nerd who loves or was born in the 80's you've gotta read this book!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|It was a Christmas gift for a 16 year old boy who is a geek. Of course he loved it. ;-)
B00881VLCE|5.0|This puzzle app is great. There are lots of free puzzles available and you can adjust the number of pieces based on how much time you have. All the benefits of a puzzle without needing the table space or having to do the clean-up
B009GJBEF6|4.0|For those who believe SciFi is good at predicitng the future, this one really saw the potential for how bad media can manipulate the masses.  A good Bond film is a matter of personal preference.... some love 'em and some hate 'em.  Then even among the die-hards, many have strong preferences of one actor over another.  If you don't like Bond, or you don't like Brosnan, then this isn't for you.  But if you like lots of action, a classic (if somewhat cheesy) Bond portrayal, plenty of toys, and a not quite predictable plot, then by all means, this one is worth seeing.
B003ZJ0ZX0|2.0|I notice when I put it on ITUNes, the program does not recognize the product, so I heavily suspect that the CD I received is a bootleg product. For that reason I give this vendor a bad rating even though the cd plays the music fine.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|As many of the cinematographer's movies, this is an ideologically inspired film - good setup, personalities, etc. to make seem real but it has a hidden agenda - is the current president a 'lincoln-type'. The picture of Lincoln is not realistic, I've read many Lincoln related books that provide substance for his leadership, abilities and views of the original Constitutional America. There is little or nothing of this in this film.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Overall this season was great.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is well done from the standpoint of a piece of television too with acting, sets, etc.<br /><br />The good of this season is we're back on the road again with more zombies!  Every minute is still about staying alive and how the 'group' manages to do this (or not at times, there are of course many deaths).  An assortment of new characters are brought it and how that clashes with the already existing folks.<br /><br />I will say that the start of the season spent out searching grew a bit tiring after a few episodes.  I understand they were trying to stay true to the comics, but sometimes things don't translate well from one medium to the next.  There's a reason anytime print media is turned into film that something is removed or added.  I wish this could have been shortened but it wasn't too terrible.<br /><br />As a positive note - the second half of the season got much better.  I will try not to have too many spoilers, but Dale really brings it home by stressing to the group about losing their humanity.  I think this is the epitome of the season and emphasizes the show is about people and not zombies.<br /><br />Overall a great season and I'd recommend it to anyone.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is the future. A beautiful interface that makes me think - who needs newspapers? Highly recommended and its free...really it is very free. Why 20 words needed in a review?
0385349831|4.0|To begin, this is the first book I read from this author and I liked it alot. I'm looking forward to reading his other works.<br /><br />Well written. A wise man indeed. He talks about many things. Few of my favorite subjects (don't wanna ruin the book for you so I'll be very vague) are solitude, honor, victory and persistence. I gotta admit that the ideas seem a little bit contradictory though.<br /><br />What I don't like about the book is that the speaker, the \\"Copt\\", a wise man, and a seeming parallel to the Christ, paraphrases some of Christs teachings; if you read this book and then read the gospels (Matthew mostly, Jesus' \\"Sermon on the Mount\\") you'd see EXACTLY what I'm talking about. I'll give you a quick example from the book:<br /><br />\\"Consider the lilies of the field and how they grow; they neither toil nor spin. And yet even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these\\". - Page 112, beginning in line 16.<br /><br />\\"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these\\". - Matthew 6:28,29 King James Version.<br /><br />I think there is about three or four more biblical references unaccounted for.<br /><br />When you finish the book, look up Matthew 13: 3-8. (I used King James version in the example because it is most commonly used and read, but personally I recommend \\"New World Translation\\" because researches say it is the most accurate in translation.)<br /><br />Other then the 'plagiarized' parts, I thought that the book was quiet well written and the authors own philosophies and ideas well put. In fact some of the ideas made quiet an impact on me. And as I said, I look forward to read his other works.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A surprisingly prophetic look at life, love and the 'human condition'  from a uniquely interesting perspective. One of my all-time favorites.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love this show... with that said, the last event in the last episode...  really????  There are very creative things he could have done.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Very helpful tool..easy to use and work extremely well for me... I was totally surprised... good piece to have around
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Better than Dillon, I love it 100%.  Every track is a song that I could listen to over and over again!
B0083EW97W|5.0|Must i say more?<br />Great Album. loved the country feel to the whole album. Mayer Does it again.<br />You  NEED TO GET THIS NOW!
B00BOLE7X0|3.0|I enjoyed the movie....but it is not the most exciting movie in the world.  This is a truth story of slavery.  So if you're a southern born redneck, well it's not for you.  If you are an American that believes in America, this is the best movie in the history of the United States of America
B00BSOBM18|5.0|everyone in my family can enjoy this ! I really love this move and it was so easy to download on my comp and other media players , The amazon instant video is awesome!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Absolutely love this series!  Acting is superb, plots well developed.  Scary however what goes on behind the scenes of law, politics and any corruption...truth or deception???
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I truly enjoyed this. I was going to read Jurassic Park again but bought this book. It was well worth my time. The micro world can be just as dangerous as the world larger than us, an excellent read.
B000002O1P|4.0|This is a fan favorite more than it is a classic rock & roller favorite. Not often reviewed well by mainstream album consumer buying guides like the crappy Rolling Stone Record Review. This has some great deep cuts like Dogs on The Run. It also produced the chart topper &#34;I was Born a Rebel.&#34; Southern Accents is primarily a concept album about Tom Petty's South, there's plenty for everyone. Whether you are a Skynyrd fan or fan of rock above the Mason Dixon line, this classic album of great songwriting should be quite appealing.
B002CGLX3S|5.0|Great song , an American classic, song by an Icon of his genre. The song is a great listen. Up beat and goes to the meat of the song.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this album and have had it playing for months. I recently purchased it for my mother for mother's day.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I'd give it five, but there are a few parts that made me a little squeamish. Still it was a really good read. If I can find anything else S. C. Has written, I'll definitely want to read that. It is all tied up in fairly neat bow by the time you get to the epilogue, too.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I purchased this for my girlfriend because she loved it.  I also very much enjoyed watching as well.  It is a very clever and funny film.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Absolutely one of the B E S T shows on TV can't wait until season 3!!!!!!!  Keeps you wanting more
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Three stars;  the description read as if it would protect the kindle if dropped.  I have not dropped it and do not plan to.  I am not sure if it will protect.  It is very thin, lighwight.  I was able to find them at Wal-mart for about $5 cheaper
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|It's pretty much what I expected from JT after a long hiatus from the music world. He and timberland are genius at coming up with beats and groves. A also enjoyed the Spanish and middle eastern influences in some of his new songs.<br /><br />It's catchy after the 2nd listen through! Worth the buy!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Awesome...Not..must work to well, kid doesnt get off the games.  Just not like the old days.  Get outside...in all honesty, they work well and shipped before date expected.
B002ZG980U|5.0|What a movie.  Incredibly creative storyline.  The acting is amazing.  The cinematography is out of this world.  A real escapist movie.
0062073915|5.0|I was very pleased to receive this book.  It had everything I wanted in it.  I don't know what else to say.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|This is one of those what I call &#34;keeper&#34; movies.  One to always have in my collection. And the price was more than reasonable.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Extremely easy to use and fast install....all alarm clocks should be this simple!  I created a Monday through Friday wake up call and it only took a moment.  I like the fact that there is not a lot of steps...just select and hit done.  Very nice
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Godwin put together a great history lesson.  She enable me to experience the period of Lincoln's Team of Rivals as if I was there.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|This show is great. It starts off being about an scandal but moves much further in to life. It a complex and interesting show, it has twists and turn and surprises. i just love it
B006S01GH2|5.0|I was so entertained by this movie.  Quirky fun to the nth degree, will now be listed among my very favorite films.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I purchased this after having listen to music from 2 steps from hell, which is also very good.This collection was better than expected. The songs are a little longer than 2 steps from hell, so they develop more depth. If you like epic movie soundtracks, you will like this.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I used it to load numerous trays of 50 year old slides. It is fast and intuitive. Image isn't as crisp as 50 years ago, don't know if that is the blame of the slides or process. Certainly they are acceptable.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|It has been a long time since I've last read a book that sucks me in as effortlessly as Homeland. I had been eying the Drizzt series for a long time, and am I ever glad to have finally started!<br /><br />The characters are wonderfully created, and Salvatore's vivid attention to the detailed creation of his world of Drow life is sure to enchant any and all readers! I highly recommend this book at five stars.
B000QJLQY4|3.0|This has some good advice in it and covers a few very important ideas very well. However, it, like most modern books, is not very &#34;Information Rich&#34; and could be condensed.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is easily the best album I've purchased in a number of years.  The lyrics and stories that Macklemore and Lewis tell on this album are thoughtful and powerful critiques on the times we live in.  Same love actually brought brought me to tears.<br /><br />More than music.  Can't say enough how great this is.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was really a very good movie very factual and believable. This better then the first movie I saw about this subject. I would watch this movie over and over again.
0316152196|5.0|Very interesting story line and as usual Connelly  has interesting characters. Not typical of Connelly's stories was an ending where the bad guy got caught but Bosh was less than honorable by not forcing the police to tag the right killer.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I could not put it down for fear of going into withdrawl.  What a fantastic story with several strong characters.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Having said that, I have to add...the female leads constantly using four letter F ...work was a real turn off. The sex scenes were poorly done...first time I have seen a male lead actually masturbate in front of his wife! Aside from this nonsense the story was interesting and well acted. Do not let kids, even teens watch this, it is pretty gross.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Wasn't expecting too much, but love Paul Rudd and romantic comedys. If you're in your 40's (or probably even if you aren't), you will laugh out loud watching many of the scenes!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing a must buy especially cuz it's free and a brilliant game it's challenging and will give u hours of fun also u can try and beat ur friends score and be top of the leader board!that's why I give this app a 5 star rating
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am totally obsessed with Downton Abbey...I would recommend this show to anyone who likes a good drama!! Very good show!!
0920668372|5.0|This is such a sweet book. I really enjoy the story it tells. There aren't many books that short that are so touching.
B003V3FVM0|4.0|This was on my son's list. He has enjoyed the movie. It came in perfect condition so I enjoyed it.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Before giving my opinon on this product, I should first say that the only game I have tried the zoom with is Just Dance 4. Personally, I think the zoom is absolutely awesome. I'm currently deployed and my living space is about 10ft x 10ft. With everything else that takes up space in my room (twin sized bed, nightstand, mini refrigerator, wall locker, tv stand/drawer chest combo, and other smaller odd and end personal items) - the space I have to work with is VERY LIMITED - The zoom is the perfect solution. I definitely reccommend it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was mad that it ended like that. I just can't wait until the next book House of Hades comes out this fall. I hope it's as good as the rest of the series was. I wonder what will happen to Annabeth and Percy if they make it out of the underworld. Do you think that they will succeed at closing the doors of death? I can't wait to read the next book. I already pure ordered the next book!yay
B0071XO8RA|5.0|With a few minor exceptions I feel like I was on the edge of my seat reading the entire book. I had such great anticipation for reading through it in order to get the answers to the questions I had, while getting all types of unexpected twists and turns along the way.<br /><br />Definitely one of my favorite books I've read in a very long time!!!
0955153077|5.0|This is a great book about the fundamentals of digital painting. Right now it is the best book for beginning to paint in Photoshop. The basics of setting up Photoshop and art principles are covered pretty well in the first part of the book. The color wheel and blending is covered quite well. Plus there is a great variety of techniques for painting things like clouds, skin, water and smoke, etc. The core things you need to know in order to paint digitally is handled well with this guide. The book itself is of high quality with numerous high quality images on thick pages. It comes with a nice plastic slipcover that protects the book.<br /><br />The only downsides would be that the book is mainly geared towards concept artist for video games and movies. So there are no real live model or still life studies. Also, the print may be a little small for some and I did see at least one inconsequential typo.<br /><br />All in all this is currently the definitive guide to learning how to paint in Photoshop. This book will of course not replace those two things that are essential to all artists, which is practice and experimentation but this book will guide you in the right direction more than others.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a story full of the most happy moments and teary eyed moments. This book is awesome! I'm speechless!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fun to play. The searches are done pretty well. Had some hidden items that were well placed. Cant get out of the safe with the files once u push it without having the correct code from the telescope. Good game though.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A Blast to Play<br />I Recommend this to anyone who has yet to try it.<br />It is a very addicting game
0425263916|5.0|I loved it got to say it kept me guessing and confused! And I cried w/Eva and just couldn't help but fall into the story!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wonderful book  -well written and a bit of a thriller. Highly recommend this book.  Starts a bit slow, but quickly gains momentum.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it I laughed and just felt the emotions! I love Cary he's just idk but I love his character!
B0064MGU98|5.0|This caught me from the very first episode and I blew through the whole series!  Once you start you won't be able to stop.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|I think that this game is kind of cool because it keeps you occupied for a while and it gives you other free games
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After watching this season I can't wait for the season to start up again.  I wondered what all the hype was about and now I know!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Maria Stephanie Mesa Cruz<br />Brian Antony mesa Cruz<br />Rachel mesa Cruz<br />Jonathan mesa Cruz<br />My brother and sister favorite color<br />Maria's favorite color is purple<br />Brian's favorite color is orange<br />Rache<br />Jonathan's favorite color is blue<br />My broth
030759565X|5.0|I want to make every recipe I. This book.  The ones that I have tried so far are really good.  Beautiful pics of the food as well and actually fun to read commentary.
B008M0NDOK|1.0|Waste of money,poorly built controller with terrible analog sticks.the lag was crazy bad. Support for controller is terrible about 6 games only compatible.
1451695195|2.0|After reading \\"Heaven is for Real\\" and \\"To Heaven & Back\\", I was excited about reading a similar book.  This book contained no scriptural references or, more importantly, Jesus.  The author made statements like \\"everyone will go to Heaven\\" and \\"I realized that the proscriptions of some religions against naming God or depicting divine prophets did indeed have an intuitive correctness to them...\\".  Alexander does a lot of boasting in this book.  This book reads nicely for fiction but considering it is fact reminds me to beware of false teachings.  This book falls more in line with supernatural and the occult.  It is not surprising how popular the book is with the \\"world\\".  Not too long ago, erotica became mainstream with \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\".  Beware!
0307476073|5.0|This is one of the most poignant, beautifully fragile and touching books I've read in some time. It even rivals Eat, Pray, Love, which was an amazing journey. Wild is all that and more, with the tremendous physical and psychological sacrifice and hardship Cheryl put herself through to heal from emotional wounds. A victory, a triumph of human spirit! This is absolutely a must read. I loved it so much I won't even pass it on...I will instead read it over and over. This is the type of book all aspiring writers wish they could write. Tremendous, shattering, and monumentally healing!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. The book has a specific style it was written in - in form of letters written by the main character. It's unusual, but you get used to it pretty fast, and it's very readable. You should read it, and then watch the movie, which is also pretty good! I would definitely recommend it.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Mawkish subject treated with French flair. Could have quickly turned to bathos. Instead infused with wit, brio and humor.<br />The two protagonists, the quadriplegic musician and the ex-con turned good samaritan despite himself are as well matched as a violin and cello in a quartet. Opposites attract and this becomes almost a buddy film. From the opening car chase to the heart-warming ending you root for the two heroes. I compared this to the treatment of paralysis in the American film the sessions and the difference is as wide as the Atlantic. A must see film.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|If you are a Bowie fan then this is a must have, after all its his first recording in 10 years. If you are not a follower of the Thin White Earthling Heathen Ziggy, its an OK recording worthy of anyone's purchase. Songs like \\"The Next Day\\" or \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\" or \\"How Does The Grass Grow?\\" are some of the classic Bowie song sounds that fans will love. One can't help but make comparisons to earlier albums like Scary Monsters, Heroes or Station to Station for example.<br /><br />But if you are a casual listener expecting the hits of another Let's Dance, then you may be disappointed. If you want to hear that kind of pop then you should think about re-listening to that recording. This isn't to say its not good, its just that The Next Day isn't of that top 40 ilk.<br /><br />However, this is a solid effort by a master of the genre doing what he does best.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|It's OK but I thought Helen Hunt was not right for the part. It would have been better with a young Julia Roberts. She would have given this important theme (after all the dimension of sex is not to be neglected because an individual is paralyzed) a lighter touch: serious but not solemn. Just didn't quite work for me. When they finally went at it, there was post coital melancholy instead of elation. I would recommend this to psychologists.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|makes absolutely no sense to make a device (k.f.) that has so little of memory capacity that it cant even download a game..really pointless to even search for good games anymore..don't get your hopes up on getting this game unless u don't want any other one on kindle
B008JFUUIA|2.0|This move is beyond cheesy.  The voices are good, but the fat girl is over the top and frankly annoying.  I will probably never watch this movie again.  It was also waaaaay too long.
B0034G4P80|5.0|It's surprisingly well done. The writers, directors, and actors could have made a very campy movie with special effects, but instead they made a fun movie with a good story.
1400079144|4.0|This is a fun book.  I recommended it to all my friends who live in the Wash DC area and are familiar with all the monuments there.
1451638450|5.0|Just as fun as &#34;A Civil Campaign&#34;, and fans finally have the long-awaited Ivan book we've been bugging LMB for.
B007MG360G|4.0|this game needs some more elements to play with and experiment with but I like it ..........finding the right elements was tricky but fun and totally time consuming.
B005IQZB14|2.0|this gal was a little into herself.  I suppose going off on the trail as she did helped her to find herself, but a wondered just how much the experience actually did or if she could have accomplished that same thing by any other means
B004T2QZL8|5.0|could use some more element groups but its fun enough and time consuming :) it is one of my favorite games
B009FZFONO|5.0|I was not sure how this season would be but with all the twists and turns I really enjoyed this season.
0061765236|4.0|Chris and Emily have been friends since the day they were born and their friendship evolves into a more romantic relationship. Everyone believes that they are soul mates and that they will eventually get married. So when Emily ends up dead from an apparent suicide pact the family is shocked. But there are doubts to this story and Chris becomes a murder suspect.<br /><br />I believe this is the first Jodi Picoult book that I have read and I really enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down. I easily fell in love with the main character, Chris, and felt that he was very well-developed. It is a heartbreaking story and it is horrible to see how one very sad event can completely tear families apart.<br /><br />The trial that goes on in the story really kept my interest. It was probably the most interesting part of the book in my opinion. The suspense kept me reading. I do have some complaints about this book though. I wish that Emily would have been developed a little more and that there would have been more to her side of the story. I would make the whole story a little more complex and believable. Especially the part about her wanting to commit suicide. I really didn't like her at all and found her to be selfish. Yes, her reason for suicide would have been life changing but it would have turned out just fine. Perhaps she just sees it as the end of the world as a lot of teens do. But what makes me even more aggravated is the situation she put Chris in. You don't do that to somebody you love and care about!<br /><br />The ending left me happy but is it realistic? I don't know. I don't want to go into too much detail about it thought so I don't spoil it for anyone. So yes I enjoyed reading it, some things could have been better, and I will check out more books by this author.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i love it. it is great. weather on the go and works well with kindle format. plus it is a free app.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love this game....it is very addictive. I like how you can improve your results, it makes it challenging. Great graphics too.
B005DJREJS|1.0|Don't bother watching this or letting your kids watch it.  This is junk food television for the mind.  What you put in is what you get out and the output from this input I wouldn't want to see.
B001W63DX2|5.0|As an avid Iron Maiden fan, this was a missing piece of my collection. Shipped on time, as expected, and was a GREAT value at the price I paid! Love it!!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I loved this book. The story is a perfect combination of history, intrigue and adventure. I enjoyed her writing style and she kept me reading every word in every page - you can't skip any detail.  I am now reading the second book in the series and I am enjoying it just as much.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I could not believe that I found this collection at this price! Shipped on time, and was a SUPER buy!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun, basic app. I like it because it's not one of those apps that want you to spend money left and right, although you do have that option. It's fun for adults as well as kids.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I thought the story line during the first season was better.  But, in both seasons, Jessica Lange knocks it out of the park.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD along with No More Trouble Zones and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism a few years back and still integrate these DVDs into my workouts. This DVD has three levels; each around 30 minutes. Most of the time I alternate between the 2nd and 3rd levels. I thought the workouts were tough when I first started, but was able to do each of them within the 30 days and still find levels 2 and 3 challenging when I'm looking for a quick mid-week workout.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|Of the three recent H&G films, this one is certainly the best. I enjoyed the film up until I understood what was happening, and at that point the film makers couldn't bring it home. The movie looked like it was shot on the same set of \\"Red Riding Hood.\\" It had medieval gadgetry including a fully automatic spear tip thrower. I felt like this was a Riding Hood companion film, just not as good in spite of Gemma's cleavage.<br /><br />As famous witch hunters, H&G have their own groupies.They are hired by the mayor because of a rash of child disappearances, which we quickly find out is for a special ceremony. The dialouge was so-so. I couldn't help think of a line from LOTR when Hansel says, \\"Evil is upon you if you like it or not.\\" Indeed much of the script feels like it is borrowed and written for tweens. The witches in this film are very powerful. They travel through the woods at speeds which look like \\"Twilight\\" vampires. A film for teens.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs (at least 2 by Gemma Arterton) No sex. Nudity (Pihla Viitala) 3 1/2 stars
B00AECGQF2|2.0|I bought this  game because I have it on my phone and I liked it so I bought it on my kindle and it won't let me play I wasted 3.00an  I want it back
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|Arnold plays a small town sheriff after leaving an exciting life in the special forces, the LAPD, and as a cyborg. We get to meet the various characters in the town when suddenly a farmer is killed and his land is being prepared... Meanwhile...<br /><br />In LA, a high level cartel prisoner is being transported, a man who also drives race cars. Before Arnold can say, \\"I know what's coming\\" we know what's coming too minus a few details.<br /><br />Not since \\"Rocky V\\" has there been generated so much excitement about a comeback. Arnold plays Arnold, reminding me more of the \\"Ben Richards\\" Arnold. Perhaps it is because of his use of the word \\"negative.\\" The characters and the over the top action make the film worth watching. Unfortunately the characters fell a little short on development and the action didn't go well with the script. The town confrontation scene was haphazardly done. Forest Whitaker plays an FBI man who should have been better developed and could have added some fun to the script. On the plus side, the script was \\"tight.\\" It didn't give you any wasted scenes which didn't tie in later to the film. I like that aspect of writing.<br /><br />The day is saved by a gun enthusiast who have fallen out of grace for the moment. A worth while edition to an Arnold collection.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs (some with an accent). No sex or nudity.
B005K17RU0|3.0|For general information - good- poor radar information. Not good enough for spotter use.  I prefer more detailed radar information.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|I liked this show.  I was entertained and watched every episode. I thought the acting was pretty good and there were a lot of twists and turns.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game has nearly no lag. And it's free! And of course, addicting my friends and family play it!!!! So why don't you try it and like the game, thx for reading this! &lt;3<br /><br />XD
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|It is an okay game ....a little boring.....more for the younger set I think......over all its okay.....would not pay the price for what its really worth
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Jack Ryan Sr. is back in the Oval Office and back in the fight - this time with the help of his son, &#34;Junior.&#34;  Senior and Junior make a great team, fighting a cyber fight torn from today's headlines.  Good stuff!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I had this game on my pc but i like it better on my Kindle. Its so fun and looks great
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Modern x files... love it!!! Walter absolutely makes the show. rHe is hilarious. The story always takes an unexpected twist. Keeps you guessing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the perfect ending to a really good trilogy. Super sweet and very hot. James did a great job wrapping everything up.
B00BJUQP4A|5.0|Love Maddie so much! Saw her for the first time on instagram and then bought a digital copy of Maddie on things. It's terrific! Thanks Theron for sharing Maddie and your own thoughts.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent, action packed, intense, emotional and something I find missing these days and that is offering hero's worthy of tee shirts. I'm hooked, hope it never ends!

1250012570|5.0|\\"Escapist.\\"<br /><br />A word I cringe every time I hear it spoken, because I know behind those syllables lies a boatload of assumptions about taste, art, and How We Should Spend Our Time. In some literary circles, it often seems like anything widely appreciated or enjoyed by young adults--from Meg Cabot's Princess Diaries and Star Wars, to Taylor Swift albums, The Lord of the Rings, or The Legend of Zelda--is worthy of being held up as kitschy and contemptible. Especially, if, god forbid, it dares to get emotional.<br /><br />\\"Look at those teens,\\" our prototypical guardian of culture sneers, \\"with all their hacky, sentimental escapist entertainment. I can't wait for them to grow up, settle down with their feelings, and learn to appreciate Real Art.\\"<br /><br />Even the klatch of English majors I glommed onto in college often held prejudices like these. Never about the things that we appreciated, of course, just the things that every other college sophomore was into.<br /><br />Somewhere down the line, we'd settled on two big premises about culture and YA fiction. First, to escape from reality is to compromise the meaning of art. Second, all young people ever do is chase after escapist trends, and therefore, all young people are shallow, needing nothing but cheap tricks and airy sentimentalism to satisfy them.<br /><br />It's rare for me to find a story written for and about people my age or a little bit younger that exceeds these expectations. So, listen up, readers who still remember what it was like to be 16:<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell's Eleanor & Park is a book that absolutely gets us right.<br /><br />In a story of two young misfits who connect through escapist interests and fall in young, passionate high school love, there are so many levels where an author can fail. Simply put, Rowell succeeds.<br /><br />I can't count the number of YA misfit romance plots that go something like this: gawky sixteen year old boy falls for the tall skinny Goth girl in English class because she totally knows her way around a good pun/reference joke/macabre comment. Or, to draw an example from the genre of indie romantic comedy, you've got Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in (500) Days of Summer, who falls madly in love with Zooey Deschanel's Summer more or less because they both love The Smiths. WHIMSY!<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is nothing like that. There is no fill-in-the-blank, check-off-the-list sense to the way Rowell's leads encounter culture. The two kids are real people with genuine interests, who are unafraid to openly disagree about the geeky things they grow to have in common. Tell me the last time you heard the female geek character shut down a conversation about how Watchmen deconstructs five decades of comic books or assert that she's the Han Solo in a relationship.<br /><br />Beyond the way that Rowell understands the language of teenaged geekery better than just about any author I've read, this book strikes at the very heart of the escapism question. Park--a New Wave loving,  comic-book devouring half-Korean--has built his identity around the sense of alienation he feels in lower-to-middle class Omaha, especially from his masculine, war-veteran father. His struggle, his drive, is to accept that someone could want him. When you don't yet have a driver's license, there's just no better escape than punk rock, even if it only takes Park further into himself. In his mind, he's not just a freak or a geek--he's an alien.<br /><br />But it was in Eleanor--overweight, unruly redhaired, big sister Eleanor--that I found my way into the heart of this book. Like Park's moody black clothes, Eleanor's unconventional wardrobe speaks volumes about where she's at--putting together the pieces of a life made-up of leftovers and scraps. Where the sterotypical YA female lead is chiefly unusual only in her own perception, Eleanor presents herself as unapologetically weird. (The \\"makeover\\" scene that brings her closer to Park is miles away from Danny and Sandy.) The song titles scribbled on her notebooks are the ones she hasn't heard, constricted as she is by being poor in more ways than one.  Eleanor's not just a misfit--she's a survivor.<br /><br />These two have no business falling in love, but they do it anyway, erasing the space between them slowly at first, but then madly, passionately, as only sixteen-year-olds can. Despite all of their struggles, all of the heavy things they carry, Eleanor and Park are still two kids in love, determined to have the time of their lives, however they can manage. The desperation, the hunger, the need that underlies their relationship is utterly real.<br /><br />Rowell writes emotionally rich fiction, daring you not to feel just as deeply as her characters, daring you to write them off as inauthentic, naive, hormonal. If you can come away from this book still believing that young love is a fallacy, I'm not sure what will get to your heart and change your mind.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is a book that made me laugh out loud, hold my breath, bite my lip, rock back and forth. When I read it, I was on a train, with nowhere to go, and Rainbow Rowell held my attention in a completely arresting way. After reading her first book, Attachments, I wished more romantic comedy films were made like it, but when I read Eleanor & Park, I was gladder than ever that Hollywood would never touch it. This is a heartpounding book that needs to be read with in the voice and immediacy of its protagonists.<br /><br />This isn't a book to read and escape real life. It's a book that enters into life as it is, full of all the terrifying things we run from and the people we run toward who are our whole world. This is the story of two misfit punks whose escapes are intertwined inexorably, like the cord of Walkman headphone.<br /><br />Read it if you've forgotten what it was to be young and desperate, read it if you remember, read it if you're still that kid on the bus no one sees.<br /><br />Read it and fall in love.
1616550414|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3QWA5373TS988]]Publisher Dark Horse did a wonderful job with this translation of the Japanese edition.<br /><br />The cover design is different from the Japanese one but the book here is bigger, which is great because some of the annotated text are quite small to read. It has a nice thick hardcover with 280 thick pages. The production quality is top notch.<br /><br />The book is split roughly into four parts. The first looks at the concept art for The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, then the history of Hyrule, next the concept art for all the Zelda series and finally a 32-page Skyward Sword comic by Akira Himekawa.<br /><br />There are lots of character designs and accompanying notes. There are so many that you really have to have played through all the games to recognise them. Also included are discarded characters, dungeon design sketches, creatures and other props. There aren't much background art. The newer games have more content while the old Nintendo ones much less. It will take a while to go through them all and peruse all the little details.<br /><br />The middle section on the history of Hyrule should be quite enlightening for Zelda fans. You'll see how the stories come together when each game features a different era. The timeline is chronological order and sometimes even splits. This history is probably what the fans have been waiting for.<br /><br />This is an amazing book for all Zelda fans.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)

B00B9JDBSY|3.0|It's been 7 long years since the excellent Silent Shout graced our ears (3 if you count the Fever Ray project, which I do) and now, out of nowhere, Shaking the Habitual suddenly appears on my doorstep. Needless to say, after a couple of listens, this isn't Silent Shout 2 or Deep Cuts 1.5 but it does share the same amount of quality and catchiness as the former albums.<br /><br />The Knife do what they're good at, and what they're really good at is causing a cacophony of melodic noise and haunting vocals, with a dash of foreboding beats and ominous atmospheres to set the mood. A good portion of this album has some great cuts on it, including Cherry on Top and Full of Fire, while few others are just plain filler and tend to drag out the album to unnecessary lengths (Fraking being the prime example).<br /><br />Say what you will about the duo's weird antics behind the scenes, they know how to make an impression. And if this album doesn't show that the Knife is one of the very few quinntissential electronic acts of this generation, then hell if I know what does.<br /><br />Buy this.

1250012570|5.0|\\"You know you've read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend.\\" ― Paul Sweeney<br /><br />Somehow, that's exactly how I felt when I came to the end of the book. I even turned back to make sure that I didn't miss something and try to convince myself that there might be other pages. And when I realized it WAS the end, I felt like ... that's it? I WANT MORE! I want to know more about them, their relationship, their families, especially Eleanor's ...<br /><br />Really, I don't know where to begin. I think I really need some times to form words. Sigh...<br />I'm kind of newbie in Young Adult genre (yeah, I know I repeat it many times) and despite there are sooooo many YA books out there I want to read, I decided to read this one. Maybe because it's the first YA books I got from Net Galley. Well, no surprised actually when my request was declined often, for I had no history with YA books. :D<br /><br />I received the ARC like months ago. Maybe because I wasn't in the mood, after started and reading 2-3 pages, I wasn't connected. I decided to read it again some days ago when I was struggling with the flu. Although it's a bit hard for me to read with teary eyes, I kept on going. I did need few days to finish it. But at least I didn't start reading something new.<br /><br />At first, I couldn't imagine the situation described. I wonder if Eleanor was that 'bad' with her appearance. I also tried so hard to imagine what Park would look like when he's half Korean, but has green eyes. But anyway, the story, the plot and the flow just sucked me in. I'm 100% sure some people would consider it boring with this kind of storytelling. I can't say that I loved it, but, well, it just sucked me in and forced me to keep going.<br />I loved both Eleanor and Park character. I loved how their relationship started and developing. I loved the way they started to noticed each other, but didn't know exactly what to say. You may say that they communicated without words at first. Well, of course aside the very first words Park said to her on their very first meeting.<br />I loved how Park deliberately read his comics slower because he realized that Eleanor read it too. I loved the way Park let her borrow his comics and introduced her to some music, or how he made her a mixed tape. Oh dear! That's soooo me back then. :D Well, I didn't really connect to the bands mentioned in this book, I didn't recognize most of them, except like the Beatles or U2. I loved how Park decided to ask his grandma AA batteries for Christmas present. I really think Park was sweet. Well, and maybe, just like Eleanor often said, dork. I loved their first touch, their first kiss. :)<br />Of course, there were times when I felt like, how could their relationship went so easily from being just friend to boyfriend-girlfriend stuff. But, well, sometimes things just happened.<br />Oh, dear! I just didn't know what else to describe about this book, about how I felt while reading and after reading it. I just knew I loved it!<br /><br />Recently on my BLOG , I asked some people on my giveaway why they love reading YA. Some answered because they can relate to the characters or the problems they encountered, or how reading YA books makes them feel young again. And now I'm totally understand what they mean. :)<br />I always love the kind of story that you can relate to yourself, or to your life, or to something around you. I also love the kind of story that can easily happen to your life. I mean, I do love those fairy tale or fantasy stories. It's one of my getaway. But things like that won't happen in my real life. This kind of story, Eleanor and Park's, is something that can be happen to our daily life. Of course, I have already passed their age, but you know what I mean, right?<br /><br />Well, one thing for sure, I have to get myself a copy of this book.<br />*I received the ARC in exchange for honest reviewnicated without words at first.

0316056863|5.0|^ This is what I did the whole time I read this book. I read it on vacation and had to keep reading the parts that made me laugh out loud to my friends.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|This is a story about a 'sleepy' town in Savannah called Gordonston.The story centres around the park and the women who walk their dogs there. Something is not right in Gordonston though, and behind the curtains of the picture perfect houses, rivalries are brewing, scheming and plotting is afoot, some are leading double lives and some would rather their secrets stayed hidden. It all comes to a head one fateful morning and nothing will be the same again....<br /><br />This was a wonderful story. I loved the quirky characters and the writing style made it so easy to read. It seemed like all the characters had something to hide, and several red herrings were dotted around so as to lead me off the 'scent' I thought I was following! Towards the end, the different strands of the story started to come together and the ending, when revealed, was a total shock! I thoroughly enjoyed this and for a debut novel was excellent, and I sincerely hope the author has more up his sleeve.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was a terrific story. The entire thing felt like it could be a fast forwarded description of a series of events occurring in the near future, and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Using straightforward language, Weir takes us along with Mark Watney as he tries to survive being left behind on Mars, with compelling examples of the types of engineering successes and mishaps that would likely enrich and befoul such an experience. Quick witted and sarcastic, the main character is enjoyable to read, and the connection meant I was rooting for him the whole time.<br /><br />If you like hard sci-fi, I would recommend this as a must-read.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I didn't expect to love this book as much as I did just based on the pre-release media coverage. I actually found Sandberg to be very inspirational and I think she makes a strong case. I especially enjoyed how she shared stories of her own experiences and challenges as a pregnant woman in the workplace and a working mom, and loved how she says a career can be a &#34;jungle gym, not a ladder.&#34;

I'm not sure on the brand that came with the amp, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for.  However, I had 2 other 12au7 tubes on hand from an attempted build of mine which was similar but not exactly like this amp and found the electro-harmonix got me where I wanted to go with the amp.    Only other issues I've had is that it gets quite warm going towards hot after several hours of listening during work.  Larger heatsinks would be helpful on the ifr630s.

B00886XQO0|5.0|Perfect headset. Previously Owned the Ear Force Delta's and the x31's. Had a bit of an issue with the Delta's breaking at the extender piece. The Tangos are FAR LIGHTER! I think that will fix the issues I had with the Delta's. ONE PROBLEM.. The leather muffs add WAY WAY too much bass for me, as Im trying the \\"sound whore\\" footsteps on Call of Duty BO2. I switched them out with the Delta original mesh and that fixed the issue. So if you pick these up, I would say order cloth muffs from the website or switch it out with the PX5, XP500/510 or Delta's and you should be fine! Best headset on the market, 10/10. Bought these USED from amazon too, perfect condition, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I felt the need to write a short review and to thank Lindsey for adding this album to amazon.<br /><br />At first I just listened to the YouTube videos when I wanted to listen to her, because I am not an Itunes user for many reasons.  Plus amazon mp3 is awesome because of the cloud service.  I sent Lindsey's Digital Music Customer Service requesting they add this album to Amazon.  I got an email back saying they would forward my request to Lindsey and her management.  Haha I guess they liked my suggestion and I'm glad they added it to Amazon mp3!  I hope it's really paying off.  I would say it is with 247 customer reviews. :D<br /><br />I really enjoy all her music!<br /><br />Thanks Lindsey!

B0057R5G6E|5.0|I'm not going to take the time to discuss the three movies.  That's already been addressed numerous times; HOWEVER, I AM going to discuss the Digital Copies downloads.  It's been previously discussed that when the package arrived it was noted on the box, as well as the certificate, that the \\"Download by\\" date was 12/31/12.  This was the case for MY package as well.  I received my package on Wednesday April 10, 2013.  But, before I called to complain to Amazon, I decided to go ahead and log on to the Universal Digital Copy web site & attempt to download all three digital copies.  I WAS successful for ALL three movies.  The following is the link to the \\"NBCUniversal Codes\\" web site that lists all the CURRENT code expirations:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The expiration dates for all three Jurassic movies IS 4/30/2015.  This is the SAME date stated under \\"Special Features\\" for the \\"Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy Gift Set (Blu-ray + Digital Copy) (1993)\\" page.  I hope this helps those that have already purchased the Gift Set or are maybe considering doing so.<br /><br />Additional Information:<br /><br />I noticed someone asked what choices one has with digital copies with THIS purchase.  When I went to the web site & entered my redemption code (for each movie) I had a choice of either \\"Windows Media\\" or \\"iTunes\\".  I chose \\"Windows Media\\" which saves each move as a .wmv file.  If one wants to view these later on a Apple device (e.g. iPhone, iPad, etc.) they need to choose the \\"iTunes\\" option.  In other words, you have to decide which media format you want to download depending on which device(s) you intend to view these digital videos later.<br /><br />Oh, and after viewing the 1st video I have to concur with others by saying this is an OUTSTANDING recording showing EXTREME details from the grains of sand at the \\"dig\\" to each pore, hair, & wrinkle on facial close-ups.  It's a great set.

B00B2QG3K2|3.0|If you have their first 3 albums and liked them, pick this one up. There is still a distinct Paramore feel to the entire CD, the same that made me like the predecessors. What's changed is the sound. It feels less like you caught Hayley and the gang reading out of a journal and more like they've taken the time to prepare some poetry or short stories for you. Same source, different vibe. Also, there are funk and pop threads laced into the workings on several songs. In the end, it's an acceptable mix-up that won't hurt your ears at all. Just look at the band's history; how could we ever be surprised that they decided to try to be different this time around? And, if you're like me, you'll be a little anxious to see where they go from here. Or was that review a bit Paramore than you were expecting?
B003L77GG0|3.0|The show amazing but the ending was such crap it was just a disappointment! It left more question unanswered then the final season of heroes! I really love Smallville but this was inexcusable. before i finished the 10th season i looked up a review of it thinking people were just being stupid I finished the last few episodes i was on last night and it was just dumb beyond all means his Superman costume looked stupid. It never said what became of Lex or A clear shot of Clark in the Superman costume. For some reason a lot of the time spent in costume was C.G.I.  W T F?<br />It was just disappointing. Then when you actually do see him in costume its just his chest and it looks SO STUPID! I mean really 10 season or AKA 10 years just to see that how pathetic! I really loved Smallville but this just didn't do it justice at all. I hope they make a movie based off the hit television series to do justice to this amazing show! R.I.P. Smallville you will be missed!
1616550414|5.0|The Legend of Zelda series is probably what started my interest in gaming back when I was a kid. Ever since first playing Ocarina of Time, I have been hooked to all the the games in the series. When I heard that Hyrule Historia was coming out in English I was ecstatic to get my copy. This book is like the bible of The Legend of Zelda. It is a great read, and it was interesting to see how the each separate games timeline interwove with the rest. I also liked seeing all the art that was made for the games. Definitely a must have for any Zelda fan!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Big Bang Theory is a well written and well acted show. I love Jim Parson's character, Sheldon, the most. I have yet to see an episode that didn't leave me laughing until I cried.
1594489505|4.0|This is a very good read.  It kept my attention and I couldn't wait to find out what happened.  Exciting
B000VBIGD6|1.0|this item came on time we haven't viewed it yet but it looks new so it should be ok would recommend it to anyone that wantsI to laugh
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This was hilarious!  I laughed the whole time -- and it's a long movie -- I think it comes off better in the theater though. Can't believe others didn't love it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I did find humor in a couple of pages but for the most part, this book was a slow read for me.  If I have to keep picking it up and putting it down, I'm really not interested.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very cleverly  crafted  to keep the suspense and excitement building until the end.  I highly recommend this book to sci fi enthusiasts.
B00866JL96|5.0|Some of Nicholas Sparks's stories end sadly but this movie had a great ending,  I loved the setting of the dog kennel and the hero being at home in the &#34;peaceful&#34; environment.  Zac Efron was perfectly cast as the quiet, unassuming, hard working vet.  Tori Schilling was very good and Blythe Danner is always a plus.  Loved it completely!
B007S3S8HO|2.0|I got the K'NEX ANGRY BIRDS HAMMIN' AROUND SET for a 7 year old boy who is just crazy about Angry Birds.  Absolutely loves them.  It seemed a perfect match.  And, I think, he did have fun with it, to a certain extent.  But the amount of adult assistance needed to make this toy work at all, let alone properly, makes it not worth the frustration and inconvenience.<br /><br />1.  The pieces do not fit together well at all.  Some are too tight, some are too loose, but it makes setting up the structure overly complicated and tedious.  And a child cannot do it by himself.<br />2.  The instructions are dreadful.  So again, the child needs adult help.  There are 175+ pieces to this toy and about 5 lines of instructions.  I have a masters degree in physics, and even I had a hard time putting this together, let alone a child.<br />3.  Pretty pricy toy for a bunch of plastic.<br /><br />The best part of the K'NEX ANGRY BIRDS HAMMIN' AROUND SET is the little sling shot that the kid used to fling the birds around the room.  Perhaps that is all the toy needed to be.  As it is, the K'NEX ANGRY BIRDS HAMMIN' AROUND SET is complicated, flimsy, and down-right frustrating.  Something only an Angry Birds mega-fan would enjoy.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I like a book that can keep my attention, and this book definitely did. It wasn't too dramatic, and I felt a connection with the characters. All recipes for a good book!
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|I am a huge NKOTB fan and I have been since I was a child, this was not my favorite Cd of them it had to many slow song on it but i still liked it.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Martian; and the reason I enjoyed it so much is also the reason why not everyone will like it. Andy Weir did a wonderful job of mixing science fiction, technology, suspense and humor; heavy on the technology - which is what I really liked.<br /><br />Weir created (ahem) plausible challenges, which The Martian solved through technology, only to have unexpected events turn everything up-side-down, creating the suspense; never letting the reader get comfortable with a foreseeable good outcome. For a science fiction buff like myself, with a science background I found this to be a page-turner.
B000FBJF7I|5.0|Drawing readers into several intriguing mysteries in small towns at the edge of the Kalahari, the author paints a vivid picture of African cultural ways and opens the eyes of readers everywhere to the universality of how we ought to treat one another.  A thoughtful and delightful book.

B001O2QW9G|5.0|My four year old grand daughter love this turtle,however it is not a giant turtle its just big enough for her small hands
B006OT03BM|4.0|The collection is amazing but the manufacturer packaged it horribly.  They use an extremely adhesive tape to take all the dvds down inside the box.  The tape was so strong it actually tore the paint of the DVD when trying to take it off.  Since this was limited edition though there was no way to get a replacement.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a true story that will inspire and encourage.  If you have any interest in WWII or aircraft or history or the integrity of people this is the book to read.  I enjoyed it very much and have already recommended it to frineds.
B0018YIW4S|5.0|Replaced a long lost LP with the CD, I forgot how good this concert really was! Extra tracks were a pleasant surprise.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|What can you say about a Disney clasic and Amazon fast service, paired a great combination.<br /><br /> This movie is a great one and brings alot of memories, my sister took me to see it in the early 50s in a theator. She has passed now, but this brings memories of her back.  This a must have for any collection for all who have children as it gives a guidence to its  story unlike today. To think of the work on the way it was made and the time it took to make this from hand is fantastic. I guess I am old school, but you young people need to see what a clasic is and for the rest of us we will return to a memory.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|First of all, the price for all seven seasons and the complete collection of Columbo movies can't be beat!  The DVDs are of good quality and packaged well.<br /><br />These are unique mysteries in that the viewer knows who the killer is almost from the beginning of the show.  The real mystery is determining what mistakes the killer makes and how Columbo will solve the case from the minute details that &#34;puzzle&#34; or &#34;bother&#34; him. His bumbling, deferential manner causes the murderers to underestimate his powers of deduction.  That is their downfall, as Columbo always gets his man (or woman) even though his ability to acquire the proof he needs seems unlikely if not impossible.  It's only in the last few minutes that the surprise ending is revealed, sometimes even gaining him admiration from the killer.<br /><br />The Columbo series consists of fun, challenging mysteries with lots of famous guest stars.  It's a must-have for any mystery buff's DVD library!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is the most artistic use of 3D I have seen on Blu-ray to date.<br />Watching the BD inspired me to read the book by Yann Martel. The film follows the book religiously. (No pun intended). Nothing of importance is left out. The visuals of the movie matched the narrative of the book as I read. Purists will be pleased.<br />The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 (48kHz, 24-bit) audio is superb.<br />Ang Lee richly deserved the Best Director Award he received at the Oscars for this masterpiece. This is reference audio and video.<br /><br />The use of CGI in this film is fantastic. Every scene you see where the tiger is alone in the frame is a real tiger. I challenge you to tell the difference between the real and the CGI tiger.<br /><br />A bit about the story. This is not a religious movie per se. It is the portrayal of a boy who finds himself in a horrendous situation, fraught with peril. He must draw on all he has learned and experienced in his young life to cope with the reality of the moment. It is a testament to the human will to survive against all odds. An uplifting experience.<br />This should not be missed.
B0014JGDUC|5.0|Very comfy.. Finally found a pair of shoes I can work on my feet for 10 hrs without them killing me!

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is an awesome game, I love it!! Started playing it today, and I'm already on level 4. I guess thats not so great, but I like it!
B007HC3LHS|3.0|It took me awhile to get into the book. It was rather confusing at the beginning since it would switch back and forth throught two different time periods.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read the first book and thoroughly enjoyed it. The second did not disappoint me at all. Ken Follett continues to be one of my favorite authors.

B009AMANH4|5.0|Great Movie...Shows the Dems are the racists...If only everyone knew..not going to do this again because they want to much ...
B005LAIIHG|5.0|How does one begin to describe what this film is about? It's surely a feast for the eyes. It's an incredible piece of story telling, but it's not a story to be seen or heard. It is one to be felt. I suspect that it is one that changes in time as you change as well. I am sure there are as many interpretations as there are viewers, so I will not even comment on that part. All I will say is \\"Feel it!\\"<br /><br />My expectations were low because I don't tend to go with the crowd. It exceeds anything I could have imagined.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|The book is well written with some great insights into what went on behind the scenes of the band. I never knew how bad it was within the band with drugs. Amazing that they lived though it and came out the other side producing some if their best work ever. You think you know the RHCP's? Think again!
B004HD61KE|5.0|As in previous episodes, the book leaves you wanting more.<br />So, if I may say so, James, let them come...

B00BBW16HW|4.0|The interplay between characters is what makes this movie entertaining.  Omar Cy is amazing! A common theme in my favorite movies is a central character that affects the lives of those around him/her just by sheer force of personality.  This movie fits that theme perfectly. Even if you don't like subtitles this one is worth watching.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I saw it in the movie theater so I was so excited to purchase it and watch it again. Enjoyed every minute!
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon (1973) is now 40 years old.  Wow.  Hard to believe.  This record still gets super heavy mileage at radio stations and on CD players (and vinyl, 8 tracks, and cassettes) worldwide.  Nothing else can be said about this album that hasn't been said before.  It's an all-time classic.  It sets a certain melancholy mood when I listen to it.  The songs are airy and mysterious, yet they still rock and back a pretty good punch.<br /><br />Personal favorites of mine are \\"Speak To Me/Breathe In The Air\\", \\"On The Run\\", \\"Time\\", and \\"Eclipse\\".  The classic \\"Money\\" is great, but it's sooooooooo overplayed that I got sick of it many moons ago (no pun intended).<br /><br />I highly recommend this classic.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I may be one of the small % of dudes, other than Tina's family and friends, to have read this smart, funny book.  But I highly recommend it for any dudes who are on the fence, AND especially for parents.  If you have a wife, girlfriend, or daughter; you should definitely buy and read it.  My daughter's only 5 now, but I want her to read it when she's a tween.  There's loads of wit and insightful humor that EVERYONE can enjoy here, regardless of gender, race, political lean, etc.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This great app allows you to save battery life just by shutting down programs that are running in the background.  I really do &#34;love&#34; this app!

B009E3EY4M|5.0|This was a great buy, and was well worth the wait.  I play it often, and have bought it for other friends.
B001GUXJQA|3.0|The book was tedious.  A collection of random thoughts that just went on and on with mostly uninteresting people and events.
B005K17RU0|4.0|its a nice update that just came through ... however why on earth is there no pollen count???? under 'respiratory health ' it has Fog but not pollen....
B007NZDES0|5.0|I would recomend this product to everyone that like to enjoy of the sensuality of Sade's music.

B001OQCV6K|4.0|Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009) features Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective a traditional setting, but provides a fresh take on the classic characters, incorporating scientific advances, and making full use of modern filmmaking techniques, to produce an intriguing mystery and thrilling adventure.  It's a long way from the traditional Holmes, but with a good number of familiar elements.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. makes a smooth transition from Tony Stark to Sherlock Holmes, continuing to resurrect a career that just a few years ago, seemed to be in question. Jude Law ([[ASIN:B000HEVZ6W Gattaca]]) joins the long list of actors to play Dr. John H. Watson.  In several ways, this version of Watson is closer to being Holmes' equal, particularly when it comes to fighting, and other action scenes.<br /><br />The central story involving a plot to take over the Government, is intricate and quite grand, as Lord Blackwell (Mark Strong), a man involved with the occult, who was hanged for murder, apparently returns from the dead.  Holmes' investigation uncovers more that is bizarre, as obscure clues somehow fit into a convoluted plot, quite unique in the long history of Holmes.<br /><br />Although the time frame fits, Holmes traditionalists may object to this take on the classic characters.  During the 1980's and 90's, Jeremy Brett had established himself as the modern embodiment of the traditional Holmes.  So something completely different, seems like a sensible option.  Quite amazingly, Sherlock Holmes continues to be a character with an enduring appeal that seems stronger than ever, as evidenced by the recent TV reimagining's [[ASIN:B004132I20 Sherlock]] (2010), and Elementary (2012).<br /><br />Ritchie's film incorporates some cool storytelling devices, like numerous flashbacks to reveal hidden clues and plot developments, and stop action sequences.  Blackwell makes a worthy and imposing villain.  Rachel McAdams ([[ASIN:B001HN69CC The Time Traveller's Wife]]) plays Irene Adler, \\"the woman\\" in Holmes' life, who has a key role, working for a \\"mysterious\\" criminal mastermind, (whose identity anyone familiar with Sherlock Holmes could guess), setting the stage for the 2011 sequel, [[ASIN:B007K3JCAE Sherlock Holmes: The Game of Shadows]].<br /><br />With impressive action sequences and special effects, an engaging storyline, bold musical score, and reinvented characters that interact in a lively manner, Sherlock Holmes was a huge success.  Robert Downey continues his remarkable return to form, as one of the most bankable of actors.  The film's dark atmosphere is nicely captured on the Bluray, and is highly recommended to fans of Sherlock Holmes, or the action genre.ays Irene Adler, \\"the woman\\" in Holmes' life, who has a key role, working for a \\"mysterious\\" criminal mastermind, (whose identity anyone familiar with Sherlock Holmes could guess), setting the stage for the 2011 sequel, [[ASIN:B007K3JCAE Sherlock Holmes: The Game of Shadows]].<br /><br />With impressive action sequences and special effects, an engaging storyline, bold musical score, and reinvented characters that interact in a lively manner, Sherlock Holmes was a huge success.

B005LAII80|5.0|The first release with Sylvester Stallone in it was not true to the theme.<br />This movie is true to the original British graphic novel and scored big on Rotten Tomatoes as opposed to the original. That should say it all, right there.<br /><br />:-)
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is loaded on both my wife's and my tablet and we both spend way too much time playing it.<br /><br />It is one of those games that achieves the old video game goal of &#34;easy to play, difficult to master&#34;. The game play is very familiar: match three or more items in a grid to destroy those items and add new ones from the top. Your goal is to clear enough of the items on the game board to release a certain number of special pieces that, when combined, complete an item needed for your journey around the world. As play progresses the game adds challenges (some tiles are &#34;frozen&#34;, some un-breakable items are added, etc), and the game board becomes more complex. You also have time and score aspects to the game so for each game board you can achieve 3 stars (based on how fast you accomplish your task), and you can achieve a high score. For me the challenge is to get 3 stars (the maximum) for each game board. It really is a challenge to do that for me, but then again I am an old guy and its probably a lot easier for you.<br /><br />In short; the game is reasonably priced especially for its quality and game play. It may get boring for someone that loves real-time strategy or first-person shooters, but for someone that likes a challenging time-waster, this is an excellent choice.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics ...fun game. I need the hint button and this one was great....did not have to wait long until it recharged.<br />My only complaint is that the game was too short.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Just as reference: I have only played this game on a tablet and not on a phone. Based on my experience using it on a phone would be rather difficult, but then again I don't have the best eye-hand coordination so it might not be a problem for you.<br /><br />Voxel Invaders is reminiscent of the 8-bit graphics games from the pre-historic days of video games and is similar to a mix of Space Invaders and Galaga. I know that by mentioning those two games I may have lost more than half the readers as anyone younger than, probably, 25, have never played them. Basically you are a lone spaceship fighting organized hordes of invading evil-doers. You have full X/Y maneuverability of your ship so you can move left, right, forward and back. There is nice mix of power-ups, a nice set of ever-changing challenges, and the touch screen interface is well executed.<br /><br />It got 4 stars from me and not 5 stars because the in-game documentation is a bit weak.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love the music on this CD.  I never miss the TV show and enjoyed hearing the music again. Great!!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Know it is the beginning of the new trilogy but it moved really slow for me and just like the originals seemed to drag on a bit more than it needed to
B0053TMP24|4.0|It was a really good second part, I love This series. It was still as funny as always and the end really leaves you hanging. Although I think I like the first book more, Riordan didn't really get the feel of Percy in this one so much. Still looking forward for the next book!
B00AEBB86A|4.0|I still cannot understand why the &#34;bad guys&#34; wanted Wahlberg to help stop an attempted assination when, without his help, the President didn't get shot anyway.  With all that, then why was it necessary track Wahlberg down as a bad guy?

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great series. The quality of the show is on par with what you would expect from a theatrical release.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So much of the book is happening in Cat's thoughts that a movie can never express.  Terrific trilogy demonstrating the strength of the human condition.
