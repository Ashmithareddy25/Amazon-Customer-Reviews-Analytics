B003K1EYM6|5.0|Amazon's price on this is outrageous. I bought it local at a big box electronics store for $29.99, and have seen it several other places for the same price.<br /><br />The camera connection kit does work well, however. I was able to connect my Kodak camera with no problem whatsoever.
0307271862|1.0|Have read a few Wallender novels and having heard Henning Mankell interviewed about 'The Man from Beijing' was looking forward to it. The beginning is gripping but now that I have ploughed my way through this turgid, rambling mess, I'd like my time back. Characters are flat and the plot senseless. It will be a long time before I try another Mankell title.
1601252463|5.0|The Advanced Player's Guide for the Pathfinder Tabletop Role Playing Game is the best product I have seen so far in the Dungeon & Dragons 3.5 and Pathfinder series.<br /><br />All the books I have looked at before this one (in its series) give you a small list of options for making a character. This one gives you tons of options. Four pages of feats to choose from. Four pages of new class material per class for the classes that were covered in the Core Rule Book. Whole new classes. Just a mind blowing amount of new options.<br /><br />Other Tabletop Role Playing Games have killed my imagination with the limited possibilities. They might list a class and make it look all shiny and nice. Then only give you two or three \\"real\\" options on how to build it. This has started to heal that pain.<br /><br />Now I have a feeling of truly being able to make a Character to fit my Ideal of what a character should be , not have to conform to some writers ideal character concept.<br /><br />Thanks Paizo for this wonderful book.

I knew how the races turned out, and yet caught myself at the edge of my seat cheering for him:)   I may be old fashioned, but it was such a 'clean movie' without fowl language and violence!  What a perfect movie to take your grandchildren too:)    Will be waiting for it to come out on DVD!

1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime was written by Mark Haddon, a British novelist and poet. He wrote the story from the perspective of a fifteen year old boy with Asperger Syndrome, which is part of the autism spectrum. He worked with autistic people as a young adult, which partially explains how he was able to write such a descriptive, authentic and believable character. Additionally, he seemed to have an insider's view on the day-to-day lives and struggles of those on the autism spectrum.    In the story, the main character, Christopher, is trying to solve the mystery of who killed a neighborhood dog. Christopher lives with his father in Swindon, a town in southwest England. In the course of his inquiries, he finds out some previously unknown information about his family, namely that his father had lied to him about his mother's death the year before. His mother wasn't dead, but had left them. When Christopher found out that his mom was alive and living in London with a former neighbor, he felt as if he could no longer trust his father not to lie to him and sets out in search of his mother, on his own. The author did a great job describing Christopher's train of thought, his anxieties, his heightened senses, his extreme intelligence in some areas and his lack of skills in other areas. I think anyone would find this book to be fascinating. It will make you think twice before you see someone on the bus, train or at the store and think of them as \\"strange\\".  Any reader will take away valuable insight into the lives of people with Autism spectrum disorders and their families.  I am a more understanding person for having read it.
B002GJT4XW|4.0|The first in the series and worth the money now. The additional DVD of behind the scenes work and directors comments add immensely to the value of this Blue Ray. I am curious about what the next Ultimate Blue Ray will have in it that has not been seen before. Of course that goes on for the rest of the series as they become available.

B000RC129Y|5.0|Recently i've read some not-so-good books by Stephen King which kind of cooled down my enthusiasm about him.   (See my review about \\"Just After Sunset\\" at Amazon.com)  So naturally i didn't expect much from his book \\"On Writing\\" (which is not a fiction book but a semi-autobiography, semi-study book for the beginner writer).  I feel really happy now. He made me trust him again. I can once more say that S.K. is one talented S.O.B.  Even if you do not like this specific genre you still have to give it to him. He knows what he's doing and he's very very good at it.  Stevie, in your book \\"On Writing\\" you wished for resonance. Well, you got it :)
0743243153|5.0|I had a feeling that I would enjoy this book, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. I could not put it down once I opened it.  There is so much truth and wisdom in this book.  It is very refreshing.  Peck successfully explains the problems that many people have and gives reasons as why they may have them. After reading the book, you will have a totally different idea of \\"mental illness\\".<br /><br />This book helps you understand why some people act and think the way that they do. As a result, I think it will help you with relationships. My favorite message from the book is... life is difficult and once you accept that fact it becomes a whole lot easier. And that we should WELCOME challenges into our lives because it will ultimately make us a better person. Amazing stuff- difficult to remember sometimes (lol)- but amazing. We are all a work in progress, right?<br /><br />I can totally see how some people may not be \\"ready\\" for this book. You have to have an open mind to benefit from it. You have to forget what you know or what you think you know, and just let the words sink in. Its these kinds of books that are often the most wonderful and life-changing, though.<br /><br />This is the best self help/spirituality/relationship/how to live your life book ever.  Buy immediately.

B003Q6D2B4|4.0|RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) is an entertaining, slightly off-beat action-comedy about a group of former CIA black ops agents targeted for assassination.<br /><br />Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) lives the quiet desperation of retired suburban life, his only outlet is a budding phone romance with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) a Federal Pension clerk.  Out of the blue a team of high-tech assassins suddenly comes after him, setting him on the trail to find out why.  Sarah becomes embroiled in the mess from her connection to Frank as he tracks down his old partners Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Marvin (John Malkovic), who are also on the hit list.  To ensure the success of the mission the CIA brings in a rising young star named Cooper (Karl Urban) to complete the job.  Along the way Frank enlists the aid of a former KGB operative Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox) and former MI6 asset Victoria (Helen Mirren) to unravel the conspiracy against them, which goes higher than they could have imagined.<br /><br />The film is based upon the DC Comics graphic novels, which I was unaware of, so I don't how it measures up to the source material.  The script is fun and funny with lots of characterization and backstory to help tie things together.  The little things add up: Frank's trying to connect better with Sarah by reading the same books she does, Frank and Ivan reminiscing about the old days and other small scenes like these help bring it up a notch above the standard fare.  The whole movie is fun and energetic, with the certain level of silliness you'd expect from it, but a couple of times it lands in the wrong places.<br /><br />The actors were good in their roles but Morgan Freeman's screentime is too brief and Mary-Louise Parker's character reminded too much of Nancy from Weeds.  But they all play off each other very well, and I wasn't expecting the appearances of Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Julian McMahon, Ernest Borgnine and James Remar- any of whom are a bonus.<br /><br />One of the best things about the movie was the music.  A nice mix of Chicago Blues, southern guitar and R&B bass is used for transitions and travel music, and there's a little Aerosmith and some good funky riffs thrown into the action sequences all of which work nicely and sound great.  Go over to the website and you'll hear a couple of riffs: [...] This is a soundtrack I definitely want!<br /><br />RED is an entertaining popcorn flick with some nice laughs and ok action.  The draw is more in the star power than the story.  Don't expect too much out of it and you'll enjoy it for what it is.  Better than a three but not a four.music.

0312600844|5.0|The first thing I need to say is that any person who is right-leaning will find this book offensive. This is very evident is the less than stellar reviews. It has been beautifully, and lovingly, summarized by others; so I won't contribute my own.  I will say this: This book, this story, for me, was stunning and one of the best novels I have read in years. Perhaps it was my place in my own life, that garnered these feelings. I was captivated and ensnared in the Bergland world for weeks.   Having to plan a wedding, and losing my father, forced me to read it at a slow and steady pace. And, I am thankful for this. Franzen is a master at describing long-term marriages. Having been happily married for 28 years, I still understood  and sympathized with both Patty and Walter in their journey.  His sentiments on Patty's almost \\"sick\\" love for her son, Joey, was as real as it gets, folks. I have had these almost ferocious feelings for my own two daughters all of their lives.  I completely understood how Walter \\"became\\" unhinged, a bit. I don't know if his \\"breakdown\\" in front of the masses would have been as severe, if he hadn't been so devastated by his one true love's deception. I loved the ending, and thought it rang true.... and was perfect.    All I need from a book is to be moved, engaged and entertained. This novel succeeded beyond my wildest dreams on every level. Franzen is a master, and to me, has written a book that will stand the test of time, and be lauded for quite some time.  As it should.....It astounded me.  The only problem, for me, is that it is finished. Now what do I do?
6305428522|5.0|If there were a desert island with a DVD player and a TV set -- and power -- this movie would be in my stack of DVD's to carry along. It's one of my five favorite films of all time.<br /><br />As a screenplay, it's brilliantly done; the performances are letter-perfect; and the evocation of 1950's New York could not be more on the money. I have loved this film since the first time I saw it and re-watched it countless times, marveling each time at how each scene makes its point, reveals its characters and moves on to build a cohesive whole. Simply wonderful.<br /><br />My only quibble -- and I remember it every time I watch the film -- is in the wrenching and remarkable scene where Charlie finally has to admit to his father, in his Columbia University classroom -- that he did in fact get the answers on 21, along with other contestants. Paul Scofield is one of the best actors ever, with a marvelous and expressive face. Surely that face, reacting to a devastating and wholly unexpected confession from his son, should be shown in a closeup?<br /><br />But Redford, for some reason, picked the medium shot. And though I am hardly a critic of film editing, it jars me EVERY SINGLE TIME. Why not move in for a closeup of Scofield? Why not let us see his shock and anguish as closely as possible? To me, it detracts from the scene and reminds me of the mechanical process of editing, when I should be deeply caught up in the characters' dilemmas -- Charlie still wanting his father to understand, Mark unable to fathom why his son -- HIS SON! -- would cheat on a QUIZ SHOW ... (And if I ever meet Robert Redford, that's the one question I HAVE to ask him ... )<br /><br />I can't add anything to what all the other reviewers have said. But I've got my list of desert-island movie material ready, and QUIZ SHOW is on it. So if you happen to know of a desert island with reliable electric power and a DVD/TV set up, get in touch ...
142311339X|5.0|To start off with, \\"The Lost Hero\\" is the first book of a series that follows the events of the Percy Jackson series. So, to be blunt, you'd be kind of lost if you read this without finishing off those first!  The basis of the story is that a teenager named Jason finds himself on a school bus, not remembering anything about himself. Immediately following this, he meets Piper and Leo, a girl and a boy who strongly believe that he is their good friend. Afterward, a battle ensues and the story continues on as classic mythology flows throughout the entire book.  I thoroughly enjoy mostly any book about mythology, and I would definitely mark this as one of my favorites. It contains a lot of action and information that incorporates the Greek and Roman mythology perfectly into the storyline. The plot unfolds at a non-rushed pace. I could never wait to see what happened next when I had to rest after reading it for about an hour. In simple terms...it was a REALLY good book.
0385342039|5.0|this book is such a light hearted and fun read.  I enjoy every single page; twist and turn.  It left me feeling rather sad at the end though because the story ends!!!  I want to read more!!!
0374158460|5.0|Briefly, I ended up absolutely loving Freedom, and yet I can understand how some others didn't. Some folks to whom I recommended The Corrections did not love it. I also must say I approached Freedom eagerly but cautiously especially given all the mass media hype.    What I do strongly recommend is that those who started the book, and left it early on or after a couple of hundred pages, pick it up again. You have already paid your dues, and the stories and characters take major turns after about the first 250 pages, and from there, the book unfolds beautifully. I felt the same about The  Corrections. I do agree that Franzen starts out with laboriously described caricatures, but they are caricatures whose contradictory psychological and moral impulses reveal themselves over time and in many layers, finally reaching a entirely human core. This is true even if you don't love the characters per se. None of Franzen's characters can be described as lovable. They are given to us somewhat as our birth and chosen families are -- you mostly get what you are handed out, to tolerate, reject, co-exist with, change with or somehow adapt to. That is not the same as pretending they not human beings ie caricatures (even if it is the easiest way to view them) or loving them in an all encompassing and therefore irrational way.     As the book within the book repeats, \\"mistakes are made,\\" and not reading or not finishing this book may be one of them.
B002COTI64|5.0|Regina Spektor's album Far is one of the best purchases I made last year. Sick of hearing the same tired crap being overplayed from the Top 40? Want to hear some intelligent lyrics & real melodies? Both qualities mentioned this album delivers.    Spektor's music is a hybrid of pop sensibilities & classical tunes. Her voice flows gently with the riffs & hooks she plays (yes, she can play the piano). To some casual listeners, she may ramble on about nonsense things. However her lyrics has always been one of her strong points.    My instant favorites are the pop-leaning Folding Chair & Two Birds, & the deeper Blue Lips & Human of the Year. Grab the special CD/DVD edition from Amazon.
B000V9D5LG|4.0|Very good buy. Still getting to try out its full capabilities. So far so good.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I love a good mystery, but this wasn't it. I saw and heard about this book everywhere, so, while on vacation in August I bought it to to read on my iPad. I just finished the book today. (the middle of October!). That says a lot. It did not hold my interest until about the last third of the book. I know a lot of people like it, so I'm in the minority but the first part of he book I was really slogging through. I would recommend downloading a sample prior to purchase.

0345505387|1.0|I appreciate that Ms. Gabaldon wanted to stretch her creative wings and perhaps widen her audience by publishing a graphic novel but this book is awful. I thought the artwork was poor. Mad Magazine artists would have done a more credible, consistent job - I am not kidding.  But worse, her incredible work is dumbed down and the intricate story lines woven throughout her novels missing.  To date, I haven't identified authors I consider her peers in this genre so I really look forward to her complex, smartly written, captivating books. Perhaps we expect too much of authors, especially those who have a track record of producing such elegant work.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I am not much of a horror fan, but I was driven to learn more about this movie after the buzz started regarding the American remake.  A movie about Swedish Vampires?  An image of a vampire speaking like the Swedish Chef of The Muppet Show came to mind.  Little did I know how deeply this movie would change my perceptions of the tired vampire genre.  I played the movie about 3 times the first day I got it.  I found the combination of sweet and chilling to be effective.  The end of the movie will affect people differently and will fuel many discussions about the morality of Eli's and Oskar's relationship.  Still, it is the knockout punch that floored me and made me an ardent fan.  I have also read the book of the same title and found the movie preferable as it is far more gentle.  Buyers should have no concern about the English subtitle issue since the theatre version is included.  Do watch it in the orignal Swedish.  This movie lacks gratuitous gore and inane action, so some horror fans may find it dissapointing.
B00026WUAU|4.0|Bob Dylan is a musicain from my past.  My days as a ten year old watching him sing on Tv at a peace rally in Washington DC.. THE TIMES THEY ARE A CHANGIN... Yes, the times were a changing for this Album Street Legal.  Dylan is no longer a kid with a guitar and a harmonica snarling out peace songs.  With this album we see a wonderful mix of great lyrics, good arrangements, and improved mature singing.  Dont get me wrong, but some singers accually write better songs than they can sing them.  With Street Legal, I have to say I also enjoyed Dylan's singing as well as his craftmanship for wordplay.... I also feel this way about his BLOOD ON THE TRACKS ALBUM.. it is also very good.  This CD really is a must for anyone who remotely likes BOB DYLAN... it really shines.  You cant go wrong with this purchase.
6303823351|5.0|record came in today I was happy to get it that fast. Love Beatles records, and this one is in very good shape. It plays great no scratches, sounds awesome. Really Happy thanks...
B003XQG0JI|5.0|very nice album!!! however you like or not the corrs this for sure it's great music... not electronic at all... very classical inspired yet with a touch of Irish folk to it... I really love the whole album but my favorites songs are dream of you and our wedding day; great way to introduce the album btw... so yes!!! I highly recommend the album to anyone who likes the corrs music or simply like beautiful simple music done from the heart.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Just like the guy in his machine, this film flew right by and was over before i knew it.. and thats usually a good thing. It was ok. He goes from his time all the way, way way into the future. Humans are being hunted and make you think of..indians or whatevers... I'd rather see a real intense future than what was portrayed.. one with the moon still in the sky instead of hairy monkeys or whatever they were. Though the white guy was cool lookin. I seen better...
0312600844|5.0|Franzen has such a sensitivity to the messed-up complexities of being human.  He just completely nails it.  The Corrections is one of my favorite books of all time, and Freedom did not disappoint.  Where the Corrections is all about the dynamic of a family, Freedom is more of an anthem to marriage (although family dynamics are certainly involved).  The conclusions are satisfying without being \\"feel-good\\" or sugary.  I want every person I know to read it.

B000UD0ESA|2.0|Well I just recieved this product yesterday and I figured I will finally develop an appreciation for this film. For 25 years, since I was a kid in the 80s, I have never made it through a complete viewing of this film. All I have stored in my memory are bits and pieces. The problem in the past is the film does not keep my attention. I figured maybe I was too young to enjoy the concepts, or I wasn't listening to the dialog closely, or whatever.    20something years later and after numerous releases and reedits (so I've heard) this film still cant hold my attention. And thats a shame because Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors and he normally excells in films like these. The sci fi neo tokyo environment is great but watching him constantly mope around his dark apartment drinking and staring at underdeveloped pictures was dreadful. The pacing is horrid, as usual I was sleep within the first hour and will likely never see this through to the end. So with the release of the Final Cut, I thought I was going to finally gain an appreciation for this film and understand why its considered this great sci fi classic; sadly I realize it aint gonna happen! Its just too damn boring! I throw in the towel, Blade Runner aint ever going to impress me.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I got into the first maybe 8 minutes with this DVD and I did damage to my upper arm doing the push ups.  This was way too hard for me, even following the one trainer doing the easier version of the exercises.  Really, if you are out of shape, get another DVD unless you really need to look good in 30 days because you are going to at the very least hurt very badly the day after you begin.  My copy is going to the Salvation Army.

My other favourite episodes include Sheldon driving Penny to the hospital, Sheldon teaching Penny physics and the end of season sensation when Sheldon meets an internet date. 3 discs and another 23 great episodes.
0240810961|5.0|Is this a book about how to draw for animation?  Not entirely.  You get useful insights here and there --tons of 'em, on every page practically, little grains of knowledge adding up to a great harvest --  But what this book REALLY is, is a treatise of Stanchfield's musings written across his life in the industry that sum up the philosophy of animation.  They're his famous lecture notes -- Largely unedited, often directly addressing the students he was teaching at the time, speaking his mind about whatever he found relevant to guide them further.  There are other books out there that might offer animation instruction in a more linear, comprehensive fashion ([[ASIN:0571238343 The Animator's Survival Kit--Revised Edition: A Manual of Methods, Principles and Formulas for Classical, Computer, Games, Stop Motion and Internet Animators]] ,for example), but Drawn To Life reminds you through those long nights of drawing why you want to pursue this art form to begin with.  Whole-heartedly recommended.
B003HKN52A|4.0|I find it quite amazing the after so many years The King still lives. This issue of Elvis on Tour has been slightly altered from the original release, however be that as it may, if your are an Elvis fan this is a must for your collection. The split scgreen effect is fantastic as it shows many of the hugh range of the costumns Elvis wore. It also reveals the adoration of his fans, which I suspect in many instances, mine included, is still alive and well today.  The reproduction is good and one gets a real feel of the timelessness of a famous man who changed the course of music for the world. There were times during the movie when my tears flowed as the loneliness of a star shone through. Sometimes we forget that being on top can mean being very much alone, even though surrounded by a million adoring fans. In the sea of faces where were the loved ones, where was home?   The few flash backs to the early days lend credence to the fact the fame does not mean personal happiness.  The songs cover most of his lifes work with oldies and newies being intermixed. There are also a number of his favourite gospel songs. To the Presley Estate - Thank you for this release. We still love you Elvis.

1582701709|5.0|The Secret is about the Law of Attraction.  In the simplest terms, it's about focusing on what you want and making it a reality.   It all starts with a mindset.  Are you thinking positive thoughts that will help you generate ideas to accomplish your goal?  Or are you letting negative thoughts dominate and stop you from moving forward?  Thoughts become things - not by waving a magic wand but by focusing your energies on what you want.  Too many people focus on what they don't want and then wonder why they're not getting ahead.  They worry about not having enough money to pay their bills.  They lay awake at night wondering how they're going to make ends meet.  These thoughts are draining and don't allow for any creative juices to flow.   Alternatively, other people who might be in a similar financial situation, realize that they are living today what they created in the past.  Makes sense.  If you have a lot of debt today, it's because you created it yesterday.  In order to create a different tomorrow you have to make changes today.  The Secret tells you how to define what you want and how to put a laser focus on what you want to achieve.   Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, all the great figures in history did exactly this.  They all believed what they wanted could be accomplished and then worked out a plan to get there.      The Secret discusses the importance of affirmations and visualizations.  Affirming to yourself that you can have what you want and having images that reinforce this, is powerful and effective.  Advertisers do this all the time.  When they're selling a gym membership, they show you the end result - someone in great shape.  Research has shown that seeing images of what you want is a key motivator in getting it.      Jack Canfield, author of the popular \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" series, contributed to The Secret.  He credits the Law of Attraction for his success.  He wanted to be a successful author and started focusing on that.  His first financial goalwas to make $100,000.  At the time, he was barely making $10,000.  That was a huge gap to fill but he didn't focus on that.  What he did was focus on what he needed to do to make that money and become a best selling author.  Before he knew it, things started to fall in place, which he credits to the Law of Attraction.  At the end of that year, he had made $92,000.  A few years later, his publisher wrote him a check for $1 Million.    The Secret has changed my life.  I was struggling financially and thought I had tried everything.  The book landed in my hands and I read it all the first night.  I made up my mind that I would incorporate all the teachings in the book and not stop until I reached my financial goal.  I reached my goal on February 9, 2010 - almost a year to the day that I started reading the book.  It put into motion everything that I achieved.  The Secret got me into the right mindset and I used it in conjunction with \\"Goal Your 30 Day Game Plan\\" - which was also a gift.  [[ASIN:1884956955 Goal!: Your 30-Day Game Plan for Business and Career Success]]Goal uses affirmations, visualizations, and the Law of Attraction as well.  And the CEO of Clorox endorsed it as one of the best books on goal achievement.  These two were a powerful combination and I hope that it brings you all the success and ultimate peace of mind it has brought me.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|While Season 1 might be a bit better than Season 2, this series is a winner.  The actor who plays Marc Antony is particularly good (although I didn't like the end where he and Cleopatra live a seemingly meaningless, drug-addled life).  The actor who plays Varenius (sp?) is very good, too.      The series never drags, has good production values, and is well directed/edited.    It's much better than most Roman movies.  Spartacus was almost a \\"great\\" movie; Gladiator was over-rated (and I like Crowe - see The Insider or A beautiful Mind instead).  Cleopatra was a bloated mess.       Lovers of Roman history/Caesar should really like this --- I believe it is mostly accurate.      Being a joint HBO/BBC production helps --- nudity is not forbidden and there are some good looking women.      Give it a chance and I think you'll be hooked by the third episode.

I look forward to share it with friends and family both familiar with \\"The Secret\\" and not. I do believe that a reading/viewing \\"The Secret\\" first would be best.

B002JVWR4A|5.0|First, all I can say is congrats to the two people (characters) that I have waited forever to get together in this series! :-) I am not going to spoil it for anyone who does not know which couple yet.      Second, this show has it all. It is a drama, an adventure, a love story, but to me it is the funny parts (the one liners)that make the show. I laugh out loud, so loud sometimes that my husband asks me if I am okay. But I honestly think that Season 5, had the  funniest one liners, more so than the other seasons. Every single person that is now in the show including the different interns, just blend into the series to make it all work! Although,my two favorite people are Sweets and the prosecutor(her one liners are awesome). I even think Booth's grandfather, Brennen's father,and Angela's father all add something to the series.      Way to go in keeping this series Awesome!!!!!
030745455X|5.0|Starts a liitle slow but kicks in with lots of action ! The two following books are great as well and have good action and hard to put down.<br />Too bad the author is unable to write more, I really did enjoy these three.
0345505387|4.0|Sure, its no epic book like the others about Jamie and Clare but its a fun graphic novel, fun to see the representation of the people and scenery, interesting other look at the very familiar story (probably have read it three times....). I am glad I bought it.
B002XTBEDI|4.0|After reading the reviews, I decided against ordering the sequal. I had enjoyed Cranford so much, I was afraid the second story would not come near the first as it is with many attempts at sequals in other films.     I decided, after some more thought, to order Return to Cranford based on the main female actors being in the same rolls and how much I have enjoyed the first movie. I would give the sequal a try. While I was initally a bit disappointed at some of the lack of characters from the first movie being involved and some of the storyline altered without a reasonable explaination  and the change of a few of the actors in secondary roles.,I was, on the whole, very glad I had taken the chance. The cast did a fine job continueing with the new storyline and some great new charaters added made for as much interest and mystery and entertainment as I had hoped for.
0553805371|5.0|Excellent treatment of a very difficult to comprehend set of theories and analyses. Authors inject some humor and real-world references to assist in the understanding of the complex material. Hawking is certainly a genius and the team approach to the writing really is a plus. It is a book, however, that requires studying-and re-reading to achieve maximum benefit.
0525951652|5.0|I am rating this 5 stars because all of the jerks that have given this book a 1 star rating because they don't like the price of the Kindle version. If you don't like the price, don't buy the book or wait until the price drops. Follett is a brillant author and I have yet to be disappointed in any Follett book I have read. Please, rate the product and not use these reviews for a bully pulpit.
0805087184|5.0|My 18 month old likes it.  She can name some of the animals.  I like it because it introduces color in the way they should be.<br />Children learn colors with a noun, like brown bear, purple cat; not purple, black, brown.
1597801585|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  Broken nearish-future after environmental disaster, a world still struggling to adapt and survive and progress, mostly post-carbon tech, the beginnings of posthumans - sounds like interesting scifi!  And I enjoyed the scifi elements.  The way that life has adapted to climate change and ecosystem crisis across the world is great stuff.  While some of the tech is cooler than it is practical, it all worked for me.      But.    This is a condensed version of the 2,000-word review I wrote elsewhere on the internet, because while I liked the scifi elements of The Windup Girl I disliked so much more.    First of all, here's a warning for Thai readers or anyone who knows the country very well: it's not a very good depiction.  Even taking into account the differences in 200 years, it doesn't feel like Bangkok.  As a farang, I was noticing the aesthetic wrongs.  Women wearing pha sin (clothing that got phased out in the 20th C), piles of \\"reeking\\" durians down every alley (they only reek when they're cut open, which is only done individually at a customer's request).  Dubious transliterations of Thai.  The kind of foreign language use that makes anyone who knows the words involved laugh so very much (\\"water tubs splash with snakehead fish and red-fin plaa\\", anyone?).  Based on things like this, I suspect that any Thai reader is going to notice many, many more problems.  Granted, some details are really nice (lizard-noises! night-time street stalls! garland sellers and the fact that orchids and marigolds are re-engineered ahead of many other flowers! ghosts!) but, overall, it's like Bacigalupi took the place names Ploenchit, Sukhumvit, etc and applied them to some other city, and it bugged me throughout the book.    There's also a Chinese character who thinks of white people as \\"foreign devils\\" non-stop, which felt bizarre and veering into stereotype, and the only time Muslims are mentioned is in the context of a fundamentalist Muslim uprising in Malay.  It is, apparently, impossible for current SF writers to imagine a future in which many Muslims are not fundamentalists.    Most egregious of all, to me, is Bacigalupi's handling of the titular character Emiko.     Emiko is one of a Japanese servant class of augmented humans who was abandoned in Bangkok and has been forced into prostitution.  With her the focus is so much on how victimised she is, how terrible her life is, how her altered genes make her suffer (her pores are small to make smooth skin so she can't sweat/cool properly and overheats in Thai heat; her genes are doglike and make her subservient and she falls under this sway often). Almost all of her personality and thoughts rotate around this. There are one or two moments when you get a sense of Emiko-the-person not Emiko-the-victim, but they're fleeting. And then.    When she finally snaps and kills a roomful of men who just raped her with a champagne bottle, among other things, we're not actually shown this scene, only its after-effects. The narrative spends more time lovingly detailing the aforementioned rape (plus an earlier over-detailed rape) than showing the survivor of rape surviving, and this is all upside-down and wrong and gross.    This book had far, far too many problems for me to enjoy it, as much as I really wanted to.    I did love the ghosts though.
B0042816YK|5.0|AWESOME movie!!!  Great scenery, people, story except I would have changed the ending if I had wrote the story.  But it is suppose to be according to Liz's life so I guess it was adapted well.  Not the ending I was expecting.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Oh maaaaaaan, Daria is *finally* on DVD! This includes the complete series (five seasons and two movies, as well as various extras). Two things are paramount here: the video quality is fantastic, and the new music that replaced the old music, while not the same, is just as fitting and perfect for the series. That is all that really needs to be said. Five stars.

0671015206|5.0|An outstanding piece of research well presented and easily digestible. A must read for anyone who is serious about wealth generation.<br /><br />I concur that there is probably an inverse law that states the more likely an UAW individual is to see themselves in the numerous negative case-studies, that the less likely they are to grasp the books central thesis and thus the less likely to either really benefit from the suggestions and ultimately, the less likely they are to enjoy the text and rate it favourably. Conversely, the more likely a PAW or an AAW aspiring to be a PAW is able to internalize the message the research is trying to convey, to see themselves or their aspirations in the case-studies and thus, the more likely they are to enjoy the book and rate it favourably. I maintain that how an individual digests, process the contents and subsequently rates this book speaks volumes about their consumer and investments habits.<br /><br />However, having stated the above and genuinely agreed with and enjoyed the thrust of what Doctors Stanley and Danko had to say, I did find myself from time-to-time (especially in the early parts of the book) correcting the biased (and quite unscholarly) presentation of their statistics; examples: p.16., p161., and asking questions which they weren't asking in a desire to prove their central thesis. For example the correlation between the price one pays for one's suits and one's occupation and how that profession in turn has certain inescapable knock-on effects. That is to say some professions 'require' their participants to spend a disproportionate percentage of their incomes not on wasteful consumer items, but on staples that oil the wheel of their industry, e.g. suits, watches and other clothing and accessories. I suggest therefore, that the book devote a separate chapter to correlate this and offer advice as to which professions require a lesser expenditure simply to maintain a credible position and a proportionate level of income. A good number of the respondees appeared to be business owners in quite manual/blue-collar occupations, henceforth asking them how much they paid for a suit is a mute point and totally unworthy of mention. Likewise the story of the unwanted Rolls Royce is another perfect example of how such a gift is totally inappropriate for the realm in which that recipient dwells. Therefore trying to compare, contrast or correlate such expenditure across VERY different professions and very different social stratos is an utterly fruitless pursuit. Whilst the basic premiss might  be to show that the UAW spend more on such items, those UAWs were paid professionals and not business owners and both respondents were working within different sectors therefore nullifying any such cross-reference. That I found annoying.<br /><br />All-in-all however, an excellent book packed with lots of information and lots of chances to evaluate one's own wealth and expenditure. Agree with the contents or not? It doesn't really matter, the ideas proffered are sound and valuable and should be heeded by all.er of the respondees appeared to be business owners in quite manual/blue-collar occupations, henceforth asking them how much they paid for a suit is a mute point and totally unworthy of mention.

1416562605|4.0|In the interests of full disclosure, I've had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Adiga on more than one occasion. His self-deprecatory humour is ever-present in this novel, his personality not so much channelled into a single character, as spread across several to varying levels of thickness. One pet peeve would be the inconsistency of narrative voice: the ill-educated son of a rickshaw puller would not be speaking of 'coruscating waters' and 'the heady scent of honeysuckle', however great his unfurling. That aside, the theme of entrapment is deftly-handled. This is no ordinary 'Indian' novel!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Everything about this Bluray movie is great, including the price. Less than 10 bucks! Only thing is there is no sleeve.
B001EO748M|5.0|Ok so obviously one can infer from the dvd-cover that this story of Henry VIIIth is beyond dramatized, not historically acurate, and a super-sexed up verson of history.  That being said, I loved this season the best out of the 4 of them.  I think season one was a great intro season, season three was slower and not as exciting and then the last season felt too rushed.  This season, the third season, explored the love affair and eventual demise between Henry and Anne Boleyn. Jonathan Rhys Myers and Natalie Dormer were excellently paired together for the roles.  Natalie I found to be especially beautiful and a lovely actress; I was sad to see her character die (as I knew that she had to) only because I wanted the actress herself to have more screen time since I thought she did so well.  The entire Tudors series is like a historical soap opera; so with that being said, you should be able to reasonably judge if this series is for you.
1878424319|5.0|I always enjoy a book that helps readers APPLY the intriguing principles of a book that makes readers stop and think, and this one meets my please-don't-make-me-buy-the-same-book-twice criterion.
B003YRIM0Q|2.0|I was really looking forward to getting this collection, 3 coloured vinyl records mastered by Bob Ludwig and a DVD with all the videos on it as well as lithographs, a 7\\" vinyl of Black Rain also coloured and 2 CD's. The package is very well done, doesn't feel cheap at all. Everything fits nicely together and the vinyl is in a separate side of the box set to the CD's, DVD's and booklets, as it should be. So...where does it go wrong? From the first notes of the first LP or CD you're in for a big disappointment. Another release gets ruined with overzealous dynamic range compression.<br /><br />Now I wasn't too concerned about how the CD's were going to turn out, I got this first and foremost for the vinyl and secondly for the DVD of the videos. Due to low sales numbers and the methodology in which vinyl records are created, vinyl editions of recent albums have seen better mastering than their CD counterparts. Don't get all defensive and launch into a CD vs. vinyl debate, because this isn't about that. What I'm saying is, the vinyl releases of new albums from Alice in Chains, Dave Matthews Band and others have received less dynamic range compression and less tools that result in dimished dynamics of the master that is to be used to create the vinyl, resulting in a more dynamic performance, one closer to what the producer was hearing in the studio one would hope.<br /><br />This isn't the case with Telephantasm, the vinyl is as poorly mastered as the CD is, perhaps even worse. The sibilance does not hold up well in Cornell's high notes and Cameron's cymbals and hi-hat, it sizzles into obscurity. There is little in the way of dynamics, everything sounds like your typical 2010 CD. This is very disappointing given that there are supposed to only be 5,000 copies of this. The loudness war sucks wholeheartedly, but with top bands usually only moving between 12,000~25,000 copies of their records per year the vinyl usually escapes as the idiots in A&R at the labels and those musicians who don't know any better usually don't care about the vinyl, it's not getting into enough people's hands, therefore the mastering engineer can master with dynamics intact like most of them want to.<br /><br />I compared Outshined and Rusty Cage from SIDE THREE of the coloured vinyl with my 2003 German (EU) pressing of Badmotorfinger, man what a MASSIVE difference, the sonics and dynamics of the recording are wonderful on the 2003 edition, which can still be found on the Amazon Germany website, ASIN B000057UWZ.<br /><br />If you want to order one of the two copies left, just follow through the buttons, you don't need to read German to navigate, it's all the same set-up as Amazon Canada or US. I highly recommend this pressing at 24 Euros, even though you'll have to pony up 14 Euros for shipping to North America it's still worth it to get the best sounding version of Badmotorfinger I've ever heard, although if you don't spin vinyl be content with the original CD, it's also very good.<br /><br />I was hoping with Bob Ludwig's name attached that the CD's might be okay, but should have know the label and project team probably said \\"no, we need this to be loud like other bands albums are these days, or kids won't like it\\" - which is TOTAL BLOODY NONSENSE. You can see a comparison between the Badmotorfinger CD and the Telephantasm CD in a post I made at the Steve Hoffman forums by googling \\"Soundgarden outshined telephantasm vs badmotorfinger dynamic comparison\\" and click on the first link that says \\"New release sounds like crap\\" and check out post #20.<br /><br />The 2010 tracks are clearly boosted, well outside the scope of CD's limits resulting in brickwalling and/or limiting to prevent a massive amount of clipping. Dynamics are suffering, what a shame. It's nowhere near as bad as Death Magnetic, but it's still poor.<br /><br />I will say that the CD actually sounds better than the vinyl to my ears, or maybe it's just that the vinyl sounds so poor compared to the2003 EU pressing of Badmotorfinger that I don't even remember how bad the CD sounds.<br /><br />Now maybe there is one saving grace for this package...the DVD. Nope, it suffers too. The audio isn't as bad as the CD and vinyl from a dynamic perspective, but the bitrate afforded the DVD's audio track is poor. They've gone with 2.0 Dolby Digital only at a bitrate of a little over 200 Kbps. No effort was made to visit the studio and create a 5.1 mix, they didn't even add a 2.0 PCM uncompressed stereo mix which would have been much more palatable. I'd love it if they'd included a Blu-ray of all the videos, but really the source material is probably video in most cases and the Blu-ray would only allow for less compression...but a high resolution 24-bit audio track wouldn't have gone amiss. Anyway, that's neither here nor there, it's nice to see some of these videos and remember watching the Buzz Bin on MTV in 1991 seeing Outshined...but the lack of fidelity in choosing only a Dolby 2.0 mix takes away from it. Had they used the full 448 Kbps allowed on DVD for Dolby it would have been a much more enjoyable sonic experience.<br /><br />Overall I can only give this collection 2 stars. It's well put together and definitely great for collectors, but the sonic misadventures that afflict the DVD, the 3LP's and the 2CD's are just not welcome in my house, I'm probably returning mine to Amazon.2003 EU pressing of Badmotorfinger that I don't even remember how bad the CD sounds.<br /><br />Now maybe there is one saving grace for this package...the DVD.

B000NA1OXY|4.0|Everyone seems to hate this CD, but I loved it! Truthfully, I liked \\"Under My Skin\\" more, and \\"Let Go\\" equally. But Avril still gets some good tracks out. I like reviewers who review each song, so that's what'll I'll do. Be forewarned!    \\"Girlfriend\\"-Not my favourite, a bit boring. Still a decent track, and fun to sing to.    \\"I Can Do Better\\"-A bit of a screaming one, but those are good sometimes, and this is good..     \\"Runaway\\"-Perfect to identify with. Love it!    \\"The Best Damn Thing\\"-I seriously like this, but it's nothing special.    \\"When You're Gone\\"-Lovely, but no big deal. I guess most people liked it more than me.    \\"Everything Back But You\\"-Totally cool! I love the anger and melody.    \\"Hot\\"-While it's not great, I still like to listen to it.    \\"Innocence\\"-Without a doubt, Avril outdid herself with this one! I loved it, and it really identifies with the protagonist in my current favourite story.    \\"I Don't Have To Try\\"-It's OK, but again, nothing special.    \\"One of Those Girls\\"-I loved it, especially cause it reminded me of one of my favourite Simpsons episodes, \\"Bart's Girlfriend\\". But yeah, it's brilliant.    \\"Contagious\\"-\\"It's so contagious, I cannot get it out of my mind\\" doesn't work. Sorry, Avril, but while this is lovely, it doesn't completely capture me.    \\"Keep Holding On\\"-Ditto \\"Contagious\\". Still it's lovely.    It's worth buying this, if only for \\"Innocence\\". It was a good choice for me to.

B003SNJZ3Y|5.0|From reading about the crash from the perspective of a Mortgage Trader I segwayed to this book about the history of hedge funds.  Great choice!  This is an exceptional book and I would recommend this for all those with any interest in finance whatsoever!<br /><br />The book details the history of hedge funds and their groundbreaking fee structure from the first hedge fund by A.W. Jones in the late 1940s.  Written generally chronologically it moves forward showing how people left firms to start their own and funds and also the different strategies employed by the firms.  This is particularly compelling because while I work in the Finance field my knowledge of hedge fund investing strategies and the many options was not very deep.  This book does a great job of pulling back the curtain and showing more detail.<br /><br />I will briefly mention some subjects and thoughts.  George Soros and Stan Druckenmiller are covered at length.  Their hedge fund strategies and specifically \\"breaking the bank\\" in more than one country highlights the importance and possible need for regulation of the hedge fund industry which is the underlying question to be answered throughout the book.  Also Michael Steinhart whose great run in the 70/80s is explored as well as mention of whether he dealt with nonpublic information pertaining to block trading and Treasury auctions.  Other interesting historical topics of interest were Julian Robertson of Tiger Investments, Citadel, and the Commodities Corp as well as their spin-offs.  Of course no hedge fund book would be complete without mention of the LTCM meltdown.  My personal favorite subject was of Paul Tudor Jones as I know so many of his friends since he grew up where I live and has had a run from the 80s to now.  The book does a great job explaining his strengths coming from a commodities trading background.  It really is fascinating to see the different nuances that so many of these successful investors take to achieve their goals.<br /><br />I could talk on and on about theories explored such as Efficient Market Theory as well as his opinion of potential regulation needed but instead, BUY THIS BOOK if you have any interest in Finance.  It is well worth the read and worth the time.  As a final comment I would like to add that I read the Kindle version.  The one negative to Kindle to me is you start reading and you really don't know where it ends.  I suspect there is an easy way to tell but I don't take the time to look.  This is a very large, long book that took me quite a bit of time to read.  No problem.  I'm just struggling to get used to Kindle vs. holding the actual book in my hand and knowing where I am.  You can see by percentage read that you are in for a haul but still, this book is worth the time.on about theories explored such as Efficient Market Theory as well as his opinion of potential regulation needed but instead, BUY THIS BOOK if you have any interest in Finance.

1932100660|5.0|I read this book and I thought it was pretty interesting. Dr. Campbell is a very sincere, intelligent  individual with a lot of research experience in the scientific community. This book gives a lot of good information on the benefits of plant based diets from many different sources. From what I understand there is some controversy over the actual \\"China study\\" itself. Unfortunately most of the vocal criticism of it comes from one hostile anti-vegetarian organization which is trying to promote the opposite message that saturated animal fat and cholesterol are good for you, well it's no wonder they did not like the message of this book. Dr. Campbell's character has also been seriously smeared with people claiming he is a terrorist and has ties to the animal rights group PETA when he even discusses his experiments on animal research in the book. Not all vegans are animal rights activisits or terrorists, don't buy into that B.S. He makes a good case for whole foods vegetarian and vegan diets, but I agree that sometimes the message comes off as a bit extreme. I don't think he suggests you have to be a vegan, just start eating more plants if you want to be healthy. I suggest you read the book and just make up your own mind. Don't listen to the juveniles.
B003W5C0VM|4.0|Seminal Stones.Great setlist and performance,but to release this on blu ray at a premium is a stretch. The PQ is fine but does show its age, and not sure how blu ray would offer any improvement on such mediocre source material. The DTS master audio offered is less than stellar, age of show notwithstanding. I say this because the PCM stereo track is outstanding.Definitely worth buying but buy the bluray for the PCM track of a great performance, and not for an upgrade in picture quality.

My advice is to call them before hand to make sure your machine will play them.
B000063S6Z|3.0|Play is my personal favorite album from Moby. 18 is...well, it's sort of a mixed bag. I mean, I like the melodies and the ambiance of the songs. However, unlike Play, this album lacks variety and most of the songs sound the same. I do wish there were more energetic songs here. Also, the music sounds the same as from Play, so it's more of a rehash than a brand new album. But on the plus side, there are several good songs on the album: \\"We Are All Made Of Stars,\\" \\"Extreme Ways,\\" \\"18,\\" and \\"I'm Not Worried At All.\\" There could have been more dance tunes like \\"Bodyrock,\\" but I guess the soft sounds are appropriate after the September 11th attacks (this album was released only a year after the horrific event). Still, I'm somewhat neutral about 18. There are some good songs, but I do wish it was different from the recent album.<br /><br />Grade: 5.5/10

I bought a cheap off brand one a while back and it failed within 2 months.  I bought this one and tested it out for a few months before the big presentation.  All-in-all in works perfectly.  Didn't have any problems with latency response time or performance and the presentation went off without a hitch!  I have actually used this several times since then for other presentations and have yet to have any issues.  I ended up buying another one to hook up a Mac Mini to my LCD in our living room and it works perfectly too.
B000YD7S2Q|5.0|I bought this because I could not stand the Lehnhoff production of Lohengrin (with Lohengrin, in a shiny polyester suit, pretending to compose at the piano on his wedding night, or shortly afterwards).  What a world of difference!  In the Herzog staging, I can enjoy the opera the way it was meant to be.  Buy it, you won't regret it!
B003XQRZ7E|2.0|I hate this...but this album is simply mediocre.  I have followed Joe Bonamassa since he left Bloodline, I own all of his albums, I see him every chance I get.  Great Singer and a superb guitar player, one of the best that has ever lived, but this Album...not good.        In my opinion these last two Albums Joe Bonamassa has put out have been kind of lame.  Black Rock had three really good songs, but BCC lacks substance.  I listen to Joe's previous albums over and over, not skipping a single track, and the tunes will stick in my head for days, such unique tones and touch on the guitar.  The BCC  guitar tone is boring and sounds like mainstream distorted tones you hear on the radio.         It is a huge breath of fresh air when Joe finally sings on a couple of tracks but the songs aren't the best, just ok, nothing special.  I've listened to it probably 15 times, tried to love it, but can't. I'll probably give it away.  If BCC came to town, I wouldn't bother with buying a ticket.  If the Joe Bonamassa group was coming to town I would be first in line.  Overall: FAIL.  Over hyped. Over confident. Hasty production. I know Kevin Shirley gets all kinds of praise for his input and direction...don't know what happened with this album. A good local trio could create an equal studio album, maybe not in four days...but then it also sounds like it was recorded in four days too...  On a positive side: I'm sure it was fun recording the album and collaborating with other artists and I'm sure they made a good profit from sales.         I will definitely wait 6 months after the next release and buy it used off amazon for a cheap price.
B002ZG98XW|4.0|I have been looking forward to this movie ever since I heard it was being made. I grew up in Kentucky, going to the racetrack, and have always loved the sport. For the most part, this movie lived up to my expectations, and I agree with most of what has been said by previous reviewers. However, there were two things that kept it from being as good as I had hoped - perhaps minor, but it took away the fifth star for this review. First, why, oh why, did they have the crowd singing \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" at the Derby when the horses were still in the paddock ?! Anyone who has ever seen the Kentucky Derby knows that this song comes when the horses are in the post parade ! Perhaps a small detail, but it took me right out of the \\"aura\\" of the story for a while. Secondly, and again an issue with the score, I found the religious song (Oh Happy Day) to be a ridiculous way to highlight his amazing performance at the Belmont. Yes, I know it was a reference to the earlier scene when his groom was washing him, but I just don't associate Jesus with the running of a horse race ! I was not offended as a religious person, but as a secular one. Please keep Christianity out of a movie that has had NO references to that religion. The use of it in the finale made it sound like Secretariat was a born-again Christian horse. It would have been more effective if they had just used the music and not the singing. Other than that, kudos to the actors, and the horses who portrayed this legendary animal.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|book 1 & 2 were awesome.  collins should have stopped at 2 and incorporated the few vitals of 3.  book 3 was truly disappointing.
0553805371|4.0|Dr. Hawking is without question one of the greatest minds ever. I admire him and his ability to make complex concepts almost understandable. In The Grand Design he makes the case that the universe and all in it could be and was created by the working of natural laws without the intervention of any God. The book itself is sometimes exciting and sometimes tedious. At the end I am left with the impression that while Professor Hawking wants to believe that natural laws acted to cause creation, that he himself has doubts and leaves some room for God. I guess each reader will have to decide how good is the case for natural law or if there is a role for God.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|I'll keep it short and sweet.  I liked the Director's cut, and so have not viewed the theatrical version.  I like the original ideas in this movie, and I think it is entertaining and well made.
0385736002|5.0|I have an extremely advanced reader(she is 7yrs old) and it can be very difficult to find books she likes, this book did not disappoint, actually the entire serious was perfect.   The story line was wonderful and fun, the character's were very well developed and we had a good sense of who they were and the roles they had, the action was wonderful but not gory or scary.  We love these books and cannot wait for the last one to come out in may.

B00005UW7G|4.0|Filmed in Vincenza, the majestically demolishing opera about the well known womanish Don Giovanni is supremely showy with natural backgrounds, peerless characterizations and idiomatic rapture by Lorin Maazel.<br /><br />As far as we know Joseph Losey was always a bold critic about the rules of game of his historical moment. Beginning with \\"The boy with the green hair\\" , \\"Criminal\\", \\"The servant\\"  (his unmatched masterpiece) , \\" The go between\\" and \\"Mr. Klein\\" , he proves by far, his main concern is the troubled state of things of the human being, his power relations and the irredeemable thirst of greed and vengeance against all the odds.<br /><br />Under this vision, to convey to the great screen the tragedy of a shadowy personage like Don Giovanni, fitted accurately for Losey. His merciless camera, showing the hypocrisy masked of good manners, the alter ego embodied by  Leporello and the dark vision about one of the fundamental myths of the Western Civilization are majestically showed before us through every frame.<br /><br />So, Losey joined with Bergman (The magic flute) as the only two directors who dared and won Mozart's inquisitive spirit.<br /><br />A memorable artistic feat. Don't miss it.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the \\"institute\\" of marriage with the combined autobiography of one woman's search for her own peace with this \\"institution\\".  I enjoyed Gilbert's \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\", but found it to be a slow read that had many details that were difficult to absorb with one reading. With \\"Committed\\" Gilbert provides us with an enjoyable fast-paced read that encompasses history, tradition, and personal reflection on a relationship that many people have trouble defining. This is one of the first books I have read on Kindle that I wished I had purchased in hard form so I could pass it on to my family and friends.
0596806027|5.0|I read an draft of this book before it went to press and have to say that I was very impressed.  Mark Pilgrim's writing style is well-researched, organized, pragmatic, and easy on the eyes.  It makes for a pleasant read.    His approach will give you a thorough grounding in HTML 5.  Other books will go in to how to achieve specific effects or may spec-out every tag and element in gory detail, but Mark Pilgrim's text lays the foundation for the deep understanding of what makes HTML 5 different.    This book doesn't take long to read and it gives an excellent return on the time invested.  I recommend it as the best way to get \\"up and running\\".

B003C1QIO6|4.0|If you are not familiar with Jack Johnson, then this is a real good album with all good songs. If you are familiar with him, then this is a fantastic work by a continuously growing artist.<br /><br />To appreciate Jack Johnson, you must get to know him, you must get to know his personality. This guy is a real nice person, a mean A REAL NICE PERSON. His personality is key to exploring this artist because once you understand his lyrics, then you can really appreciate what this is.<br /><br />Jack Johnson loves his wife who happens to be his college sweetheart. He has children and is a doting father. Many of these songs are simply love songs and odes to his wife and kids. That is why he is so beloved...this superstar, this rock star pays homeage to his family. Many of the songs are so personal yet they are hardly sung in metaphors.<br /><br />The motivation for this album was the loss of his father. There is elation and there is melancholy, all, what seems to be, addressing life without his mentor.<br /><br />\\"You and your heart\\" leads off and is one of the strongest songs. Unusual for Johnson, it is electric and has a strong bottom end. It is among his best works. \\"The Upsetter\\" is also a strong song, once again all electric and it even has a guitar solo (unusual for a Jack Johnson tune). \\"To the Sea\\" is a typical bouncy song, something you would expect to hear from a surfer-turned-singer. \\"At or with me\\" is another electic rocker with a fun refrain of \\"uh oh, uh oh, uh oh\\" followed by driving rave up on the guitars. It is destined to be a sing along tune when done live. \\"No good with faces\\" features Johnson's stacatto type, almost rap vocals.<br /><br />All the songs on this cd are strong and there is no filler.<br /><br />I like Jack Johnson's prior works (\\"Brushfire Fairytales\\" is not even 10 years old yet it is a classic) but one valid criticism could be that most of the songs are in the same key, with the same instrumentation, and therefore, they start to all sound too similar. That problem is eliminated on \\"To the Sea\\" since Johnson has finally ventured away from the acoustic campfire and diversified his sounds.<br /><br />Jack Johnson was a former national champion surfer that moseyed into music and is now one of the top artists in pop music. His songs are all simply ditties yet he definitely has a flair in writing very catchy songs.<br /><br />I give this work a big thumbs up.\\"To the Sea\\" since Johnson has finally ventured away from the acoustic campfire and diversified his sounds.

B003G88WTO|5.0|This album has an incredible amount of depth. I think of it as one long song rather than 9 disparate pieces. A total masterpiece.
B003TVMIDO|3.0|I was able to purchase all the 2000-2004 remasters of John Lennon's albums, Double fantasy stripped down with original mix, power to the people the greatest hits (for the singles), and George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" on Amazon for LESS than this box set. 148 dollars for all of them. I realize I missed out on some extra words written by Lennon's family, but from all accounts, I got a better deal sound wise.   The music is first class, but does anyone else think the price of the box set may be a little steep?
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|I absolutely loved this adaptation of the classic story.  I felt that it followed along the lines of George C. Scott's version (my all-time favorite) while injecting a touch of humor but maintaining a somber tone.  I was floored by the work the studio did on this film in the IMAX 3D theater, and can't wait to see it on Blu-ray.  Definitely a must-buy for the holiday season!
B003XX2PPO|5.0|I've been waiting for this kind of production for a very long time. Luis Miguel is at his best when singing pop and this a great cd from beginning to end. The only thing I can say that might sound a little on the negative side is that I wish the songs were longer but that's all.  The quality of the songs and the arrangements is very high and his voice, if it's possible, keeps getting better.  I love this album, and contrary to what a lot of people may say, I'm glad Luis Miguel got back to this style. Buy it, you won't regret it.
0439023513|1.0|The first two books in Susan Collin's trilogy were well paced, full of action, and developed the main character Katniss into a strong willed teenager.  Katniss was teenager learning to understand herself and her emotions.  The last book Mockingjay seemed like the author rushed to complete the novel while interest ran high.  The book fails to complete Katniss fairly.  She spends much of the book mentally unable to deal with what is going on around her.  Even the climax of seeing her sister killed, and killing the president are written passively.  Much time passes and Katniss tells of it as a past event after her mental breakdown.  This dampens the excitement and is a real let down when Katniss is developed as such a strong character. While some parts are exciting and written in great detail, the violent death of her team mate, Finnick, her own tragedy of her sister's death is unclear, and fragmented.     The romance that grew and blossomed through the first two novels and into the third was also poorly resolved in the end. Through the first two books she is deciding which boy she cares for more.  In Mockingjay, she never finalizes her relationship with Gale.   After growing up together, and working through so many experiences she does not even say goodbye.  In her mental state it happens as an afterthought comment... he is working in another city.  Very anti-climatic  A romantic departure or at least a farewell though dialogue would have greatly improved the story.  Peeta, the other romance, is 'chosen' not because she loves him but because he is more persistent. He also fades as a character since we never learn about his losses in detail.  His family's death and feelings in the last novel are written passively again - a real cop out from the author.  Hunger Games and Catching Fire were well planned and written.  Mockingjay is a sad attempt to bring the trilogy to a close.   [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]
B0029LHW68|5.0|After an eight teen month battle with Virgin Records, Thirty Seconds to Mars fans wondered if they would ever see a new album. After a long four years fans finally got what they were waiting for and I say it was well worth the wait. With 'This Is War' being Thirty Seconds to Mars's first album since 2005's 'A Beautiful Lie' I didn't know what to expect, with that album being such a big hit. Thirty Seconds to Mars really didn't take off until that album came out. But they took it to a whole new level with 'This Is War'. Starting in the 1998's the combination of the Leto brothers; Jared, being the songwriter, lead singer, and guitarist, Shannon playing the drums and percussion, and Tomo Milicevic being the guitarist and keyboards, they make up one of the greatest followed bands of our time, Thirty Seconds to Mars.   This album is one of a kind. They did something that has never been done before. They did what they called The Summit. Which was roughly one thousand fans from around the world contributing their; stomps, shouts, screams, claps, and hums. But that wasn't all once word got out that they were being used for the album many fans wrote in and were disappointed that they weren't able to make it. So they then did what was called The Digital Summit which allowed anyone with a computer to join and be a part of this album.    Immediately with the first song ' Escape' you are able to hear the different voices from The Summit. Which blew me away the first time hearing it. It was such a unique idea and a great way for the fans to feel more a part of the album. What's also great is that it's not just in one song it's throughout the whole album. From the french lady in 'Night of the Hunter' to the stomps and claps of 'Vox Populi' the Summit really brought the album together and was one of the factors that puts this album over the top.     The fact that it had been over four years since there last album 'A Beautiful Lie' had come out made me a  little hesitant on what this one was going to sound like. But it was definitely well worth the wait. The songs on this album go way above there others. The way they are put together on the album you almost have to listen to the whole thing because they follow together so well one right into the next. They take it to a whole new level with this one.     'This Is War' is definitely a must buy album. You wont just listen to one or two of the tracks and never listen to it again. You will fall in love with each and everyone of the songs, you wont be able to listen to anything else. So go buy 'This Is War' and become part of the other two million Echelon followers of Thirty Seconds to Mars.
B000NU2CY4|3.0|Be careful when ordering this item from Amazon.    Paramount remastered the disc and released a new version in July 2010.  They did not recall the old version and there must a lot of inventory out there.  I checked with Amazon before ordering but still received the old version.    I could have returned the item to Amazon but decided to just exchange the disc with Paramount.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|A really fun, funny movie which grows on you with repeated viewings.  Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant come together to make havoc and destroy almost everything in the path.  Katherine Hepburn is a heiress who is prone to disaster.  Cary Grant is a nerdy, scientific zoologist poised to a marriage with a woman who openly states her only ambition is to further his career.  Katherine falls for Cary and does everything in her power to keep him from getting married to the other woman.  A leopard who becomes their baby is their reason for song.  Just love it!
B003UESJJC|5.0|Of all the versions that I have seen, over the years, I still don't know why the village bombing at the end of the movie is never shown? I saw it one time only on KTLA Ch.5 Los Angeles, in the 80's. As the boat pulls away from the village you can hear the radio chatter, then as the picture fades to black, you normally just see the end credits. This one time, there is a flicker of light and the village is blasted endlessly as the credits roll. I wonder if that ending will be included in this package?
B003ZK58WM|5.0|There is a lot to enjoy and learn from this book. A great combination of riveting story telling and detailed history. Due to the rich characters, action and political perspective on the second decade of the 20th century, this is pretty much a must-read book. There is a lot of history, some soap opera type personal events for the characters and drama that keeps the reader moving quickly through what could have been a very long book if it weren't for the story telling skills of this author. There is something for everybody in this book and it is highly recommended.
B000FA57US|5.0|This is my favorite Horror movie of all time it has evreything one has and more unlike it's predecessors, Halloween 5 has little Jamie who is able to feel what Michael Myers feels by virtue of being her niece, and strongly connected to her telapathicaly has many similarities to the first one, in the sense that Jamie wears a clown costume in the 5th one which Michael Myers also wears in the first one so the movie reminds me of the first one almost like an off shoot. The movie has thrills gore sex violence what else can you possibly want, you have to see it to believe it.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Eclipse is by far the better movie. I hated Twilight and actually fell asleep the first time I saw it because it moved so slowly and the characters weren't as well defined as they are in the book. I did decide to take another look when it came to cable and decided it wasn't the actors who trashed the movie but the director and screenwriter. The actors were uncomfortable and awkward in the movie because that's how they were depicted in the books. Everyone. Charlie and Bella weren't physically affectionate. Bella was an outsider in AZ, therefore felt awkward in Forks. Edward was afraid he'd kill Bella and felt physical pain when he was near her because he wanted to kill her. So after re-watching it, I got it, but it was not translated to the screen how/why Bella and Edward were so passionate about each other.     Fast forward to New Moon and Eclipse. Thank goodness they got new people behind the scenes because the movies began to improve. Edward was a bit more emotional in Eclipse than he should've been with Jacob. Jacob, in the books is a bit immature and silly and Edward is, afterall 109+ so he's more of a grown-up. He's more in control. They really need to work on Edward and Bella's passionate scenes. These two should be slobbering all over each other and breathing heavy until Edward comes to his senses and pushes Bella away. That's what you got from the books, but it's not intense in the movies as it should be.    Hopefully all that pent up angst will be shown in Breaking Dawn and not PG as it was in the books. Bella and Edward should get down and dirty and show more passion for each other. Afterall, Bella has been lusting for Edward and so have we. Give us what we want!!!
B001CZJKS0|5.0|This is an unbelievable box set which includes the famous  icon mask of William Shatners face molded. an excelelent compilation which includes my favorite Horror film of all time Halloween 5. It does not tackle movies that do not have to do with the story like Halloween 5 which did not have Michael Myers at all and a little known fact was not even created by John Carpenter but rather George Romero. It explores all aspects of all films that really left their Mark on the Halloween franchise, with amazing features previously unavailable in sets especialy accept for this one I do not know of another box set that even exists of this amazing collection. A must for anyone who is a die hard fan or has a friend or relative that is a die hard fan. A real Splater fest with the bonus william Shatner mask how can you go wrong.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|If you are over 20, and seen any animations from Japan, go ahead and watch this. Also it would be of much help is you go through the TV series alongside. Gives you quite a few \\"a-ha~!\\" moments.
0060751967|5.0|However, this book was still a great read. It was funny, sexy, and suspenseful.<br />I have now collected the entire Love at Stake series, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes paranormal romance. No, it isn't Twilight, but in my opinion that's a good thing! The vampires in this series lean more toward the typical definition of a vampire. Fall asleep during the day, burned by sunlight, etc. More importantly.. they don't sparkle. These vamps are sexy and dark, not whiny teenage boys. So if you're looking for a more mature vampire read, this is definitely the way to go!
0439023513|3.0|I don't want to give away too much for those who haven't read it, but I was so excited for this book. It was easily the worst of the bunch, failing to close out the story with much flare. It seems at the ends as if her decision between gale and peeta was just added at the end. Throughout the story, there are multiple thoughts in Katniss's head, instead of forming cohesive pictures, the book jumps from topic to topic, in a somewhat confusing way. I also don't understand what the deal with Peeta is, what happened and how he went haywire was such a drag, its like hes a little baby. Again, a disappointing end to a series.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|i agree with thomas m. de feo, there is just NO chemistry between stewart and pattinson:  edward and jacob should run off and get married in toronto and create a totally NEW tribe (family) of two-spirit vamp-wolves; now, that would be a major, chemical reaction.  call the series, the 'two-spirit saga' and really torch the screen with some immortal vampire-werewolf action.
B00415MUWG|4.0|The &#34;Kiske / Somerville&#34; project was promoted as being the melodic metal debut album of the year. While not exactly true, this is an enjoyable duet album with a lot of hooks, exceptional vocal performances and several outstanding songs.  The idea of bringing Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween, Place Vendome, Unisonic) and Amanda Somerville (Aina, Avantasia) together to form this project was conceived by the president of the record label Frontiers Records. The songwriting was assigned mainly to Mat Sinner (Primal Fear) and Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear, Allen/Lande), with further input from Sander Gommans (After Forever), Jimmy Kresic and Amanda Somerville.  The self titled debut album finds the two vocalists dueling with one another and singing together in unison, in a diverse sounding project. The music includes melodic rock tracks, melodic metal numbers, ballads, AOR moments, along with some symphonic touches as well.  Just to get things out of the way, the vocals throughout the album sound amazing, with great trade off lead passages as well as harmonized choruses. Both Kiske and Somerville give their best, delivering diverse vocal performances and working with one another as if they had sang together for years. While neither singer tries to overshadow the other, or to display his/her full range, they still manage to individually shine throughout. The instrumental portion of the album is also solid and filled with memorable guitar riffs, wonderful solos, orchestrations and great drumming by the numerous participants.  Highlights of the album include Silence, Arise, End Of The Road, Devil In Her Heart, If I Had A Wish, Don't Walk Away and Set A Fire.  The single &#34;Silence&#34; is a melodic power ballad with some of the most memorable vocal performances on the album. Violin backing, keyboards, guitar riffs and energetic drumming provide the backbone for both Kiske and Somerville to interchange both emotional lead vocals and harmonized choruses as well. The addition of orchestral moments together with some keyboard soloing gives us one of the stand out songs on offer.  &#34;Arise&#34; is a groovy hard rock number. The song includes impressive guitar riffs, squeals ala Zakk Wylde, nice bass lines, soft verses, a fitting guitar solo and an infectious chorus, carried mostly by Somerville and finished in a higher pitched mode by Kiske. This is one of the heaviest, more up-beat and more memorable moments of the album.  &#34;End Of The Road&#34; is a symphonic ballad done in a magnificent way. Emotional vocals, orchestral parts, some heavier outbursts and an addictive chorus provide the recipe for one of the best tracks on the album.  &#34;If I Had A Wish&#34; is a strong melodic metal track and another stand out song. It starts with a melodic intro and continues with catchy guitar riffs, impressive drumming, nice guitar solos and exceptionally well sang verses (but suffers a little from a somewhat uninspired chorus).  &#34;Devil In Her Heart&#34; includes a bombastic arrangement, a catchy double chorus, memorable guitar/keyboard solos, along with a lot of vocal transitions and trade offs. A very well done melodic rock song, which brings to mind the most impressive duets of Meta Loaf.  &#34;Don't Walk Away&#34; is an up-beat AOR track, which resembles the happier moments of Kiske's Place Vendome project. An uplifting tempo, Kiske's flawless higher range vocals, a catchy chorus, a simple but fitting guitar solo and you've got another good track.   &#34;Set A Fire&#34; is the heaviest song on offer and closes the album in a powerful way. The track is characterized by heavy guitar riffs, emotionally sang verses by Amanda, fitting backing vocals by Michael and a heavy chorus with high notes by both vocalists.  &#34;A Thousand Suns&#34; features Amanda on the vocal lead and it is her shining moment. Melodic guitar leads, emotionally driven verses and an outstanding harmonized chorus, provide the elements for a good but not great powerballad.  &#34;Second Chance&#34; is your standard mellower ballad. While nothing spectacular, the song is emotional, includes deeper lower range vocals and is a memorable offering.  The down side of the album are some weaker tracks, one of which seems rather strange as it conveys a mixed feeling of trying to be both a little heavy and mainstream at the same time. The inclusion of some generic choruses, doesn't help the weaker tracks either.  Fans of Michael Kiske, Amanda Somerville and Place Vendome will surely love this effort. Fans of Mat Sinner's and Magnus Karlsson's songwriting will also enjoy most of the songs. Hard core metal fans will probably like 2 or 3 songs and hate the rest. The majority of the album features truly great tracks, excellent musicianship and amazing vocal performances.  (This particular edition comes together with a bonus DVD. The DVD includes 2 enjoyable videos for the songs Silence and If I Had A Wish, along with a 10 minute Behind The Scenes documentary)
B003XRZZFM|1.0|Dimmu Borgir should be ashamed of themselves, this is a complete disgrace to black metal... disgrace to metal in general. Sounds like Dimmu Borgir has officially turned to sellout metal. The album sounds like it has no heart and was just pumped out for a producer hence all the guest appearances. This is hands down the worst Dimmu Borgir album. It may even be the worst album I have heard this year in metal.. don't waste your money.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I agree with many of the 5-star reviews.  This device has some great features and I've really enjoyed having it.  I particularly enjoy knowing exactly what my running pace is while I'm running, which only a GPS watch can really give.     I use a mac and I have had zero issues with Garmin's software, uploading data, or using the data with other sites like dailymile. It's as easy as they say.  Stick the ant thing in my USB hub, walk into the room with the watch after a run, and in 5-10 mins it's all uploaded and ready to review or share.     What I'm less pleased with is the battery life.  My watch is about 6 months old, and I've used it about 80 times. Usually I bicycle for 4-5 hours or run for 2 hours.  My battery is now at the point where it sometimes doesn't make it to the end of a bike ride.     4-5 hours of battery life just isn't enough.

B002PMV9FG|1.0|I was very disappointed in the dark movie. Couldn't even see the movie most of the time. The story was great, if you could see it. I think it was copied. I have never seen a movie so dark. I have ordered others and movies were never like that. I am very, very disappointed.
B0034G4OVS|1.0|One dumb self-absorbed female blonde (how creative) and two dumb self absorbed semi-jock types do what the demographic for this movie would prefer to do their entire lives which is to hit the slopes and chase chicks. The entire dialogue, including when they sit in the stranded lift for half the movie, revolves around their self-absorbancy. Boring!!  The point of the movie, as we all know from the beginning, is that since we started with three characters then two must die so it's just a matter of being entertained by how.   Unfortunately the potential hook is deleted into special features and what you do get to see of the two victims is a brief cheap scene of some dogs eating some slaughter house tidbits and a couple of really cheap prosthetics.     Further, to the most unlikely sequence of events that left them stranded is the obvious escape which is to use hands and feet to slide along the cable and, of course, never occurs to our potential victims.     It's really hard to feel connected to a story in which the events are so contrived; acting so shallow; and dialogue just sophomoric time filling.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|The control set up is a lot like the 360 which is what we wanted. The range however is bad. anything beyond 8-10 feet is no good. Lights flash and it loses signal.  Otherwise the controller is ok. The range really killed it for us.
0984334904|5.0|I'm very pleased with my purchase. the flash cards are of very good quality construction and loaded with the information I needed. I've been bringing a few at a time to work for review during breaks and lunch and they have stood up wonderfully (and they really do clean up easy too). An excellent buy and highly recommended.
0375836675|5.0|I absolutely loved The Book Thief which prompted me to select I Am the Messenger for my Book Club. I loved this one as well although I will say some of the appreciation I had for this book took a few days after completing the book to sink in. The more I think about it and re-read passages, the more I love it. I think Markus Zusak has a way with words that few authors have. I find his works to be poetic and touch me in a way that not many books do. The ending struck me as odd at first but, again, the more I thought about it and then re-read it, the more I really liked what he did with it. Don't let the Young Adult classification keep you from reading this, adults. I would have said the target audience is adults; I'm not sure my teenage daughter or most other teenagers would appreciate it the way they would when they are older.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|I wasn't disappointed.  Clapton seems to have found a niche and some pleasure in it, and there I am enjoying it as well, in my own rocking chair. I'll listen as long as he plays.  He's like old leather - real comfortable.

0385732554|5.0|I've just finished reading this book in an intermediate English as a Second language class, and it was wonderful. Deceptively simple, \\"The Giver\\" is the story of a Utopian society that has chosen Sameness over uniqueness, given up freedom for a life free from pain and suffering. Jonas is 12 years old when he is chosen as the one to \\"hold\\" all the memories of the past, good and bad, to protect the society's tranquility from being disturbed. Jonas slowly discovers the price that has been paid by leaders in the past in return for the Community's safe existence in the present. Lowry slowly reveals what the truth is, as Jonas learns it. This is a great book to teach and think about--I truly enjoyed it.
B003YWUTKM|5.0|You know...  I have read some of the reviews and... I have to say, it is somewhat disheartening to hear others say things like... If you are expecting a solo Gilmore... Or... it just sounds like The Orb...  That is because it is The Orb featuring David Gilmore. And furthermore, to those who say it is the end result of a jam session... And the problem is? If you have ever just wanted to sit back and listen to Gilmore jam... this is your chance.  David Gilmore is a jam guitarist. In fact that is where he is at his best! This CD is a well needed fusion between two Greats. The Orb is awesome! Gilmore hands down is the ultimate emotive guitarist.   These two together have created something that was long in coming. If you loved  Pink Floyd's Echoes, or Shine on, and ANYTHING by the Orb, I urge you to buy this CD. It is worth it, and I could only dream to create works of the caliber of these fine gentleman.
030745455X|3.0|A lot of my dissatisfaction with this book is because I thought the three books were independent mysteries.  Dragon Tattoo was a great story with a definitive conclusion.  However, this book is mainly a set-up for book 3 and has a massive cliffhanger ending.  The cliffhanger would not have been an automatic disappointment if the book had been a well-developed story, but it wasn't. This read like a bloated \\"middle\\" - half the book passes before the mystery is truly introduced, and again the author is excessive in giving unnecessary details.  Part of the problem is Lisbeth Salander.  In Tattoo, Blomkvist was the main character upon which the narrative focused and she was an intriguing, mystifying secondary character.  In Fire, she takes center stage and it doesn't work.  The first third of the book was following her around on a world trip seeing how she views the world.  But Tattoo already made it clear she's very different, I was quickly bored following her around with no focus.<br /><br />Once Blomkvist begins working with another journalist on a sex ring expose, and said journalist is murdered, the book did pick up. But, it went from boring to frustrating.  Lisbeth is the main suspect; a man-hunt for her is on.  Yet, the author spent too much time describing the clash of personalities within the police investigation, introducing new characters, and very little time actually advancing the mystery.  We go from following Lisbeth on her travels to having her every mundane action described (e.g. one full page tells readers she woke, made a pizza, took a shower, changed, straightened up, went back to bed, etc).  The \\"conclusion\\" quickly made it apparent that the mystery was never meant to be solved for this book.  The last few chapters were lightning fast, action-packed and revealed a lot of surprises and then slammed readers with the cliffhanger.  Two-thirds of this book could have been discarded (and I did skim a lot) and the rest added to the beginning of Hornet's Nest.<br /><br />Overall, though I disappointed, I'm still interested in the characters and the mystery.  However, this book left me feeling frustrated and not excited to move onto the last book.  I will read it, but I'm not in a rush.  Recommended to patient readers who liked the characters, and who have book 3 on hand and ready to start.Overall, though I disappointed, I'm still interested in the characters and the mystery.

0756665949|3.0|First, an initial statement of possible sources of bias: I am a professional academic and an unapologetic LOST enthusiast (you may read what you like into that conjunction).  I ordered the LOST Encyclopedia on May 4 and received it on October 12 following a delay from its original listed release date of August 24, so I've been anticipating its release for a while.<br /><br />Second, an executive summary: as a fan of the show, I'm glad to finally have this \\"encyclopedia\\" on my bookshelf and think it an excellent resource.  Nevertheless, the presentation of the book is somewhat less polished than I would have hoped, leading me to suspect that a second edition may be in the works.  Any recommendation that I can give would therefore have to be a guarded one.<br /><br />Like the show for which it serves as a reference guide, this book must have been a massive undertaking for everyone involved with little guarantee of pleasing everyone in its audience.  I can therefore forgive the omission of some items (no entry for the Hybird, or \\"Hurley bird,\\" for example) and the lack of linked entries (e.g. \\"The Hatch: see Swan Station,\\" or \\"Jeremy Bentham: see John Locke\\").<br /><br />My objections to the book's editing begin with the character entries, which are generally sorted alphabetically by first name.  I have no problem with organizing an encyclopedia in this way, as this is hardly an academic text and there are a variety of minor characters whose last names are unknown; however, the glaring exceptions to this rule--John Locke, whose entry is filed under \\"L,\\" and James Ford, whose entry is filed under \\"S\\" for \\"Sawyer\\"--happen to be among the most important entries in the volume.  Finding those entries will only take an extra few seconds of the reader's time (especially since, as mentioned above, there are no linking entries), but the organization comes across as sloppy.<br /><br />Also sloppy are the various textual redundancies.  In the \\"Man in Black\\" entry, for example, a text blurb entitled \\"Jacob's Spirit\\" calls attention to the fact that \\"The spirit of a young Jacob repeatedly appeared to the Man in Black while he was acting out his end game as Locke...\\"  One page later, immediately facing that blurb, is another blurb entitled \\"Haunting Reminders\\" which calls attention to the very same fact using the very same text, the only difference being in the capitalization of a single word.  Similarly, the entry for Magnus Hanso ends with a three-sentence paragraph: the first sentence states that \\"Hanso's death remained a mystery to the outside world [until] DHARMA Initiative member Stuart Radzinsky documented Hanso's final resting place on the Blast Wall Map\\"; the second sentence states that \\"Details of Hanso's death remained a mystery to the outside world\\"; the third sentence states that (you guessed it) \\"DHARMA Initiative member Stuart Radzinsky documented Hanso's final resting place on the blast wall map.\\"  Again, this book constitutes a relatively massive undertaking and it's understandable that various typos would slip through (and there are a number of those), but given the two-month delay in the book's release I would have expected the editors to catch these obvious artifacts of the rewriting process.<br /><br />I had initially speculated that the publication delay was a function of the writers' need to rewrite some entries in light of the final episode's controversial revelations regarding the \\"flash-sideways universe.\\"  That was apparently incorrect, as the only reference to the flash-sideways (that I've found, at least) comes at the tail end of Juliet's entry.  Instead, all information about that \\"universe\\" is relegated to a few text-light and picture-heavy character entries that follow the encyclopedia's index.  The entries seem arbitrarily organized (in order: Desmond, Hurley, Ben, Sun, Jin, Sayid, Kate, Claire, Locke, and Jack) and utterly disconnected from the rest of the encyclopedia.  To the writers' credit, they call attention to some quotes from the final episode that should help confused viewers figure out where the flash-sideways universe fits into the overall story structure; however, one is left with the impression that someone involved with the book's production was embarrassed by the reception of the final episode and wanted to minimize its influence on the rest of the text.  I would certainly hope that delaying publication gave the writers and editors adequate time to integrate this information--if they had wanted to do so.  For better or for worse, this storyline is as much a part of LOST canon as anything else and it should have been treated as such.<br /><br />Finally, there are several minor factual errors in the text--particularly with respect to the descriptions of the philosophers referenced by the show--but those are more nits to be picked than they are problems affecting the book's presentation.  Nevertheless, it's an editor's job to pick those nits before publication.<br /><br />Again, I'm glad to own the LOST encyclopedia and will readily admit that fans of the show (be they dedicated or casual ones) won't be able to find a better reference.  The content is top-notch, covering both breadth and depth, as detailed in other reviews.  If asked whether or not I would recommend that someone else spend $25 on it (much less the $45 cover price), however, I would only be able to answer that anyone considering doing so should take into account the very real possibility that an updated and cleaned-up new edition may be forthcoming.  Of course, I also can't guarantee that any such edition will actually see the light of day.  As such, I have no regrets on my part, but less risk-averse fans might think otherwise.de that should help confused viewers figure out where the flash-sideways universe fits into the overall story structure; however, one is left with the impression that someone involved with the book's production was embarrassed by the reception of the final episode and wanted to minimize its influence on the rest of the text.

B0034G4P7G|5.0|This is by far one of the most amazing movies I've seen so far. I don't see any other movie being able to top this one in a long time. All the hype around it is totally justified. The actors did a great job! I loved the portrayal of Mark by Jesse. This movie is definitely a must see!
0312600844|3.0|First off, I love Corrections. I received Freedom as a gift and began to read it with great enthusiasm.<br /><br />Franzen is a fantastic writer. His development of characters is among the best I have ever read including Updike, Irving, and others. At the end of the book, I felt like I knew Patty, Joey, Walter, and Richard intimately. Franzer shines when delving into their psychological background, deconstructing their every motive, fear, and ambition, even going back through generations to explain their actions. This, to me, is what great literary fiction is all about. He gets inside his character's heads brilliantly.<br /><br />The downside to this book, at least for me, was the characters themselves. Although superbly described in every detail, I found too many of them incredibly distasteful. Patty has a loving, devoted husband yet is so emotionally cruel to him it was almost hard to read. Her son, Joey, is so obnoxious I was rooting for bad things to happen to him. He treats his dedicated girlfriend with lies and infidelity; I started to dread reading more about his awful behavior. To be sure, the characters in Corrections were no role models either. But somehow I didn't find them so abhorrent. I found them more pitiable, and interesting in a driving-by-a-car-accident kind of way. This did not happen in Freedom. I just kept thinking to myself: \\"These are awful people.\\"<br /><br />An aside: There is a tremendous amount of gratuitous sex, masturbation, and other vividly described sexual activities.  Some of this felt over the top to me.<br /><br />Finally, this book has been called in some reviews the \\"Great American Novel.\\" To me, that means it captures the experience of our times. The inside jacket even calls it a \\"portrait of our time.\\" I find this quite a stretch. Even if you consider this a story of \\"regular\\" people, they are certainly doing some highly irregular things. I don't know a single 20-year-old who is married, cheating on his wife routinely, going to Paraguay with a potential mistress, and selling bad truck parts to the American military in Iraq. I know of no 40-something women who are depressed because they are secretly pining for men they haven't seen since college, and slashing the tires of neighbors they don't like. Not all books have to be about admirable characters. And, of course, characters must do interesting things to hold our attention. Maybe the people in Freedom are representative of a type of person in our time. But certainly they are no icons of the modern American experience, at least in my view. If you read this, as I did, expecting a beautifully encapsulated view of 21st century America, you may finish disappointed.<br /><br />All in all, I give it 3 stars, mostly for the great writing. Franzen lost points from me by choosing, for his subject matter, characters that are unlikeable and unfamiliar.o Paraguay with a potential mistress, and selling bad truck parts to the American military in Iraq.

B003R0LBVW|5.0|Franzen nailed the essence of our current American dilemma ... the hopes  and dreams of those of us who were born in the 50's and 60's and had so much passion and enthusiasm.  Then, the subtle change in attitude in our psyche and our souls.  Where and when did this happen?  The story is told via the lives of Patty and Walter Burgland, Richard Katz (we all know him personally and and idolize him - because he, in all his madness, is the only character that kept his integrity intact). their family and friends. We are them.  What was passed from our parents' generation, to ours and to our children.  Politics vs policy ... and how the two topics are perverted and entwined in our daily lives.  Astonishing account of our current existential existence. God help us all.
0312323867|5.0|I adore this book.  I actually like it even better than Something Borrowed, which is saying something.  My husband bought me Something Blue for Mother's Day, not realizing it was the follow-up to Something Borrowed.  Being something of a stickler for order, I bought Something Borrowed so I could read them in the correct sequence.  I really enjoyed Something Borrowed, but I loved Something Blue.      I loved the way Giffin wove in intricacies from Something Borrowed that were not blatant to someone just picking up Something Blue, but were keenly present if you'd read the first book.  I have read my fair share of chicklit, and I believe that \\"chicklit\\" is almost an unfair classification     to give this book.  To me, \\"chicklit\\" implies a novel that is light, frothy and just general fluff.  Something Blue is much more than that.  It's an easy read, to be sure, and very enjoyable, but the characters are so well-developed and are so easy to relate to that it's clear Giffin is a skilled writer, not just someone who knows name-brands and is capable of conceiving a storyline.      I recently re-read Something Blue for probably the 4th time in 3 years, and it was just as good as the first time I picked it up.  It won't be the last time I return to this one!
B002SRQ214|5.0|I had doubts about this processor living up to its reputation, and I guess I was used to spending more on Intel products over the past few years to expect the same quality from this processor even though several of my other builds ran great on AMD's. I was wrong. The 965 lives on an ASUS M489GTD Pro/USB3 board with 8 gigs of corsair 1600 mhz memory. On initial start up, the processorclocked 3.67 ghz and seemed to to loaf. I gave it some break in time, and tonight clocked to 3.75 ghz with no problem. The most amazing thing to me is the stability of the system (I had read a review that said the 965 was \\"unstable\\") and the fact that working temps are under 100 degrees on the Farenheit scale!! I have read of these chips clocking over 4 ghz, but I am happy where I'm at. The balance of my system is an ATI 5770 graphics card, 8 gigs of Corsair 1600mhz memory, a Hitachi 1 Terabyte HDD in an Antec 300 case. I am amazed. Too, Amazon delivered my board and processor within 36 hours of placing a midnight order. Impressive all around!!!
0316098337|2.0|The book has a good start (sad, actually, but compelling) then, half-way through the book, it loses steam and becomes a tedious journal of discovery by the little boy. The wide-eyed account from the little boy wears thin after a while, and nothing really happens in the second half.

B0043X7WLA|2.0|While normally i am open to all kinds of music and i normally wouldn't write a negative review or one at all unless i thought it was something special.<br /><br />The album started out promising and then took an Event Horizon turn.  If maybe i heard 3 out of 11 tracks, i'd think this album wasn't too bad, and actually pretty good at some parts.  You can't help but wonder if the guy mixing this was on acid three quarters of the time.  And what is with autotune on the last track starting at 10:45...<br /><br />I listen to everything from classical to heavy metal to jazz and avant garde (i.e. sigur ros), rap, harp, twigs, cans, and bongos, acappella, triangle, and keyboard typing.  I must say i started listening to this with an open mind.  I could not finish this album without stopping and popping a few advils in between tracks and then stopping to see if by some chance i had 5 different songs playing at once in my media player or by chance the song got encoded with all the tracks combined into a few songs.  I was also paranoid that the neighbors had informed local reporters that my room was a black ops site for terror-related criminal torture.<br /><br />While i must admit i have not followed his music to any extent at all in the past, i bought into this because of some of the good reviews and it seemed like a good deal, previews made it interesting.  In any event, if you watched the movie (untitled) there was music / art music there that i would consider fine compared to the stuff in this album.  The preview tracks did not do it justice.<br /><br />All in all, if not but for a few tracks, this would have been a decent album.<br /><br />This is art music, experimental, and requires a very select taste and audience.<br /><br />Do i recommend it?  No.<br /><br />Edit:  I had to admit, the original review was a bit harsh, parts of the album are fine, parts are just ridiculous.
0618918248|3.0|After some extensive reading of the book and comparing it to others of its ilk, I find that Dawkins is the one deluded!  His evidences and theorem seem to be designed to support his philosophy of life, rather than forming one's opinion from the evidence as scientific arguments would demand.  Thus I find his arguments to be fallacious and empty of real life, meaning and plausible argument.  The book was interesting, challenging and intriguing, but not life-changing.  Dawkins could do with some doses of honesty and solid evaluation of the varied evidences for the God of the Bible.
B0040T7B2W|4.0|First the good news: Stuart Murdoch and his merry band of melodic players are back. It's been four long years since their last full length recording (The Life Pursuit.) This is a safe and predictable outing from Scotland's indie darlings: Light as a feather female vocals, check; Chamber pop arrangements, check; Stuart's lyrical soft touch, check; A dash of blue eyed soul/r and b, check. It's like they took everything that people like about the band and put out a Belle and Sebastian by the numbers record. In today's pop world, that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />Now the not so good news: There is nothing on here that comes close to the heights of The State I'm In, Like Dylan in the Movies or The Model (or a dozen other brilliant songs from previous releases.) Don't get me wrong, there is some magic here: A beautiful transition, a clever line or a jangling guitar part that are sure to raise one's spirit. It just seems like we've heard it all before. Some of the melodies are similar to what we've heard in the past.<br /><br />Highlights include the bouncy tracks Come on Sister and I Want the World to Stop along with the ballads Calculating Bimbo and Read the Blessed Pages. Actually there are no weak tracks here. There's just nothing that challenges their past masterpieces. I kept wondering when I'd feel the goosebumps...<br /><br />Write About Love is the perfect album to play if you want to feel happy. It's kind of like a walk through a meadow. Classic albums like If You're Feeling Sinister are the kind of albums you play on a rainy day while sipping hot tea. Back then, Stuart could write songs about love (and just about everything else) that made you laugh and cry (with goosebumps.) As we all reach middle age (fans and band, alike), safe and sunny feels pretty good. It's good to know this gentle and kind rock band still has its heart in the right place.
B003PIUC02|5.0|This is a top notch TV Show presented in HD on Showcase, on Blu Ray its even better. The sound goes through you with every hit of a fist and slash of a sword. The picture quality is like looking out your window. The only downside not enough special features, like were is gladiator training camp? Interviews withe cast? The history is a bit off, but who cares the plots and subplots will keep you happy. And all the geeks from back in the day get to see Xena naked, what more can you ask for from a show. :)(Joke)  Overall this show goes hand in hand with Rome in regards to detail and it captivating an audience.

0586045449|5.0|Reading this novel is as close as most of us will ever come to attacking Germany in an RAF bomber.  It's a time machine, but so much more than that -- it's an unsparing examination of humanity.  The action is relentless and absorbing.  When I first read \\"Bomber\\" some thirty years ago, I finished around three in the morning and couldn't get to sleep for at least another hour.  Having experienced Deighton's vivid narrative, you'll be thankful it wasn't you who had to make the sacrifices demanded by those uncertain days.

0316098337|5.0|I found this to be a somewhat amazing book. This review will contain lots of spoilers so if you have not read it, stop right now and run out to get your copy. It is the story of five year old Jack and his mother. They are living in a single room and have done so for the entire five years of Jack's life. Initially you are not told why they are confined to this room, but as the story proceeds you learn the horrific truth - that Jack's mother has been kidnapped, held and continually raped by his father. The story is told in Jack's voice from his perspective as a precocious child. What an imaginative story it is! His persona is unfailing positive in the face of the threatening situation in which they live. I was blown away by the creativity and ability of this author to present the story in such a clever way. Jack's mother works to provide a safe environment for him all the while teaching, training and generally entertaining him within the confines of the room. Jack is totally unaware of the outside world but is happy and contented within the room - \\"...I have thousands of things to do each day\\".<br /><br />While Jack is carefree and fun loving, the reader comes to realize the situation and the terrible fate that faces Jack and his mother. His mother is also aware of the threat to them, but successfully keeps Jack feeling safe. After a very threatening time - power is cut, food supply dwindling - Jack's mother organizes an escape plan for them that relies on the five year old to perform some heroic feats. The suspense builds as the escape plan is hatched. This section of this book is as thrilling as any suspense novel I've read.<br /><br />The last half of the book deals with Jack's introduction to the outside world. While it is also well written and very entertaining it is not as riveting as the first half of the novel. His mother must deal with news media, changed family relationships and emotions that roller coaster up and down. Jack separates from the close relationship he has had with his mother and starts to develop as an independent person seeing himself as others see him. Jack's experiences in learning about the outside world are funny and poignant. In the end mother and son seem to triumph over adversity. I thought the ending where they return to the room of their captivity (a shed in the kidnapper's back yard) and decide they can go forward with their lives was a good one.<br /><br />I really liked this book. I thought the author, Emma Donoghue, took a ripped from the headlines story (see Josef Fritzl) and ingeniously turned it into something special.

B000GSA59M|4.0|I don't have a robust need for a mixer of this nature, but it was the usb functionality that sold me. I currently only have one xlr mic plugged into this, but have a lavaliere as well as an ipod that I plan on hooking up for a podcast I am working on. My only issue is that it isn't readily apparent how to operate this device, and the documentation is a little sparse. I've spent more than a few minutes browsing a forum to figure out just how to simply enable a device. I am more software inclined anyways, so perhaps It's designed for professional audio mixers. Either way, once I figured it out it has proved extremely valuable to my production.
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|Owning virtually every Clapton record/CD since his stint with Cream and being a giant fan even through his ups and downs, this record scrpaes the bottom of his creative barrel.  Just a terrible record.  It was so bad, I had to listen to it twice just to make sure the garbage I heard the first time through was in fact so bad, and not just a figment of my imagination.  This makes his other recent Reprise-era releases from the last 15 years look like masterpieces.  You will start seeing a bunch of these showing up used at your local campus record store in short order.  Stay away from this CD and donate the money to charity instead.  You will feel better and your ear drums will thank you.
B003Z39G0O|5.0|The best thing about \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" is that every aspect is incredible. The acting is fantastic, the writing witty, the stories absorbing - and the music amazing. Every week has one song or more that defines a scene in the show, and this soundtrack brings many of those moments. For example, \\"Bloodstream\\" recalls a moment from the season one finale that was one of the most talked about moments of the show, while \\"Sleep Alone\\" instantly brings back one of the most suspenseful parts of the seventh episode. But the best part is how varied the tracks are. \\"We Radiate\\" has a disco-like sound to it, while Placebo's cover of Kate Bush's song \\"Running Up That Hill\\" is more indie rock, and the original score pieces by Michael Suby are haunting and beautiful.<br /><br />What makes this soundtrack stand out, in my humble opinion, is how true it is to the tone of the series. Every track has the sound and texture of a \\"TVD\\" moment, and this album is an excellent addition to the show. But you don't have to be a show watcher to enjoy the songs (although for anyone interested, \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" is highly recommended quality TV). Don't let the cover art fool you - this CD stands on its own.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|We love the show, and it's even better without all the commercials. I just wish NBC would provide the series more support!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|There really is not much to say that hasn't already been said by the majority of the reviewers on this site. The reason why this book has a pretty darn perfect rating, is because it's pretty darn perfect. I enjoyed it thoroughly for the 2 days it consumed my life. I will never forget the story of Lisbeth Salander. It was emotional and exciting. And the ending was fair. It's going to be hard to find a book that will capitvate me to the extreme that this collection has. I will say that there is a lot of detail to follow as the story progresses. But I was never for one second bored. Huge compliments to Mr. Larsson.
030745455X|5.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire was excellent. I received it in a very timely manner and loved reading it. I thought it was even betete than The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. So easy to click to order and then receive in the mail.
B003UYV08E|5.0|OMG!  They DO rock!!!  I ordered 16 DVDs from 10 different vendors.  This one was the first one to hit my mail box and within a couple days.  The DVD was in Excellent condition.  I will most certainly order from this vendor again!
B00000ILDF|2.0|This film was completely unnecessary, Alien was a Masterpiece and Aliens was a brilliant sequel. There was no need to continue after Aliens unless they had come up with something really incredible. The film is a complete downer filled with forgettable characters that you dont care about and simply put, it's just boring.<br />All the glory and victory from Aliens is wiped out in the first ten minutes and killing off Ripley is one of the worst decisions in cinematic history.<br />It's weird, it takes place on a maximun security prison planet yet all the inmates speak with an upper class British accent. Even the monster is lame.  Mostly it's just a CGI interpretation instead of an actual costume effect and it's poorly executed as well. Sigorney Weaver looks bored througout the film and it's pace is so slow that you just want the film to end.<br />This is a movie that truly should have never been made.
B003JR1JV0|1.0|The DVD was a huge disappointment! I cannot recommend it. She is out of breath on most of the songs from running pointlessly around the stage, so she can't hit any of her notes. The song she does with her brother is hysterically funny. Her brother just basically growls into the microphone. It sounds like he is vomiting. He also makes these spastic chopping motions with his hands. We could not stop laughing, he is SO BAD! In the interview segments between the songs, Miley seems drunk half of the time. It was embarrassing to watch.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Matt Bomer gives the best performance. He brings the charater of the con man turned FBI CI to life with style, charm, humor. Add the relationship with FBI agent Peter Burke played greatly by Tim Dekay and the show really comes to life. This show makes me take a new look a White Collar crime.   This is a great show for FBI show fans, drama, comedy and of course it doesn't hurt to look at Matt Bomer.
0316069485|1.0|There are thousands of terrible books written every year. Yet, even after all this time, it always bothers me when a talented author succumbs to the siren call of mediocrity and starts churning out poor prose. I am aware of the financial pressures on authors, and I am well aware that good writing is not rewarded any more, but you know what? It still bothers me every time.    Whether it's Stephen King, descending from Salem's Lot to reach the depths of Under the Dome; Michael Crichton, whose crisp writing in Andromeda Strain was nowhere evident in his later novels; William Gibson, whose work represents a steep but steady decline since Neuromancer; even Ishiguro, whose latest work was unreadable next to Remains of the Day - all these annoy me.    Now Connelly joins the crowd. While The Lincoln Lawyer was tightly written and suspensefully plotted, this latest Mickey Haller novel is awful. It's terrible in so many ways, that I am not sure where to start, but here goes.    (1) The writing. The prose style is pitched carefully at a sixth-grade reading level, albeit interspersed with a tremendous stream of profanity. It's extremely boring to read, full of simplistic word choices, dull syntax; it mainly comprises insipid dialog in fact.    (2) The plot. The plot is just a bunch of cliches from police procedurals strung together. I do not want to be accused of spoiling the plot, such as it is, so I do not want to adduce examples, but there are a ridiculous number of cliches. Basically most every plot point comes from some bad movie or TV show. In Lincoln Lawyer, I sensed the author knew something about how law was actually practiced; here, I just sense the author has watched a lot of movies about the police.    (3) The characters. The most annoying thing about this book is that it eviscerates the character of Haller. Rather than being a reflective, intelligent attorney who peers beneath the surface of things as in the earlier books, Haller is portayed as a simple-minded bully. If Connelly must write a bad book, why can't he at least use new characters? Why ruin good characters?    In conclusion, there is nothing to recommend about this book.
B003Y8YXH6|4.0|John Lennon and Yoko Ono's musical collaboration \\"Double Fantasy\\" was originally released on Nov. 17, 1980, just three weeks prior to Lennon's murder at the hands of Mark David Chapman. Following the tragedy, the album went on to win the Grammy award for \\"Best Album of the Year\\" in 1981, and in 1989, it was ranked #29 on \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's list of the 100 greatest album's of the 1980s.    Now, 30 years later, Yoko Ono has collaborated with co-producer Jack Douglas to bring us \\"Double Fantasy Stripped Down,\\" the new remixed and re-mastered version of the album. All 14 original tracks have been \\"stripped down,\\" which essentially means that many of the outdated and downright distracting studio effects and embellishments are gone. The second disc is unchanged aside from the tracks being generically re-mastered.    Lennon and Ono's vocals are now more prominent in each track, where they were somewhat buried in the original mixes. It's amazing how much more organic and timeless the songs sound now that they have been remixed to a stage nearly resembling demos. Lennon's love for his wife is more present then ever here, as most of his song's deal with being a husband and father, settling down from his rambunctious life on the road with The Beatles, and beyond.    Although the stripped down album is clearer and feels more natural, the first half of the album is stronger on John's part, with brilliant remixed versions of \\"Just Like Starting Over,\\" \\"I'm Losing You,\\" and \\"Cleanup Time.\\" What makes these new versions work so well is strength of the vocals, which are allowed to breathe without being suffocated by needless studio excess.  The second half of the album proves to be less impressive, as Lennon's songs \\"Watching the Wheels\\" and \\"Beautiful Boy,\\" both great songs, don't shine much brighter than their original releases. \\"Woman\\" is the clear exception, as the new remix is astoundingly fresher than the previous recording.    Unfortunately, Ono's songs fall far shortof Lennon's both in songwriting and overall catchiness. Her first three songs, \\"Kiss Kiss Kiss,\\" \\"Give Me Something,\\" and \\"I'm Moving On\\" are nearly unbearably screechy. However, where Lennon's songs waver in the last half, Ono's last four songs are exceptionally moving, and it is here that we can finally hear the beauty and artistry that Lennon fell in love with. Songs like \\"Beautiful Boys\\" and \\"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\\" are what musical passion and discovery are all about.    \\"Double Fantasy Stripped Down\\" is wonderful in parts, but as a whole it's hard to say. Because the tracks alternate between Lennon and Ono songs, there are times when the fluidity of the album is interrupted by the couple's need to create a \\"double fantasy,\\" representative of their undying love. Ono should however be proud that the album is still relevant today, 30 years later, and that with the remixes she has perhaps introduced the great songs written by her and her late husband to an entirely new generation of music lovers.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I've seen the season, but my wife hasn't. I sent it to her as a gift and she absolutely loved it. Definitely a great series.
B00003CXSP|4.0|This poor film is very much mis-understood by the public. After 10 long years, Hannibal Lecter finally returned to the big screen and he was better than ever. Director Ridley Scott truly brought the Thomas Harris Novel to life with a power house of operatic visuals coupled with poetically gory imagery.    Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is now ten years older and wiser. Her life is now in shambles and after the death of a colleague during a botched arrest, her strong dedication to the FBI is now challenged by her superiors. Her time is occupied mostly by hunting down the monsterous Doctor Hannibal Lecter who violated her mind in The Silence of The Lambs all those years ago. People often unfairly criticize this preformance of Moore's Starling. Moore is playing Starling as an older, wiser, hardened FBI agent. She's not the scared trainee who was easily imitated. I think this was a shock for some people because popular movie characters rarely, if ever, mature emotionally over the course of multiple films. Moore did an excellent job and still shows the vunerability of Clarice who is now trapped in her own life.     Another common complaint of this film is the gore. Sans the death of one of Mason Verger's thugs, every murder Lecter was responsible for was a work of art. Inspector Pazzi's murder was a homage to the gruesome murder of Pazzi's ancestor. Paul Krendler's feast on his own brain was a dark joke; He was being fed exactly what he did not value. Lector's leathal sense of humor is not for everyone but it's not without meaning.      The supporting cast is also terrific in this film. Gary Oldman is delightful as the severely maimed, sociopath Mason Verger. He is a sadist in the greatest sense of the word. He gleefully recounts the sexual molestation of young boys and the night Lecter assaulted him to Clarice Starling. His vengance on Hannibal entails feeding the doctor to gigantic boars who are enticed to devour their victims by using pre-recorded screaming. To quote Mason at the end of that flash back, \\"That's Entertainment!\\". Also rounding out the cast is the delightfully sleazy and corrupt sexist Justice Department Official Paul Krendler played by Ray Liotta. Krendler is one of those characters you watch and wait patiently to get \\"his\\" and as I explained earlier, all thanks to the good doctor.          As much as I enjoyed Hannibal, the main problem I had with the film was that it dosen't get into Hannibal's mind as much as Thomas Harris' brilliant novel. In the novel, we learn that Lecter long ago lost his sister named Mischa and he has reoccuring nightmares of her murder and misses her desperately. He recalls her in his mind ,referred to as his \\"Memory Palace\\", were he could retreat in a world that is after him. His only comfort in a world that is after him. In the film, it's not so much about Lector and more like Lector being active. Outside missing that mark ever so slightly, the film is one of Ridley Scott's masterpieces. People were expecting another thriller ala Silence of The Lambs but they came to the wrong place. Hannibal is suppose to be a horror film and it works.     One last note. Though Thomas Harris agreed that the contriversal ending the novel should not have been in the film adaptation, careful viewers will notice it was not entirely omitted.

0375812024|5.0|I gave this book to my nearly 3yr old on an airplane to help pass time.  There is a lot to look at in the pictures so your child may take time enjoying it over and over, but it could also be overwhelming to a tot.  My daughter really liked it, but didn't \\"read\\" it for as long as I would have liked on the plane.
B003TML0VO|3.0|This is certainly an unnecessary album. There is no need for it. Yes, Carlos is one of the greatest and most unique guitarists ever. And, he can make magic in the most ordinary of projects. But, he cannot overcome the concept of this album.    I am guessing that the idea sounded like lots of fun to all involved. And, the musicians probably had fun making the album. But, that doesn't help make this work well. You listen to the tracks and you appreciate how Carlos and his band are trying to put their own spin on the songs, but the results end up being weak in comparison to the originals. It is a lot like the very ill-fated Gus Van Sant version of \\"Psycho.\\" Yeah, you can replicate the original in every way, but you cannot replicate the magic.    The one track that I liked is probably the one that irks the most people. And, that is \\"Back in Black.\\" What I found entertaining about it is that it is the one track where they completely reinvented the song. And, that is what they should have done throughout the album. In \\"Back in Black,\\" I got a kick out of the 70's throwback chorus, the kicky rhythm line, and the hip hop vocals.    Hopefully, Carlos found himself inspired enough by this project to come up with a good original record that will give fans what they really want!
1934030198|5.0|The most beneficial Triathlon book I have used yet.  Whether you are new to the sport or a seasoned Triathlete, this book can help you.
0307474275|5.0|I'm a little late on the wagon, but nonetheless ...<br /><br />Other reviews go into more details, but here is my own quick response to this book from an agnostic, English Lit major and English teacher: Well written, enticingly interesting, entertaining, and very enjoyable. I think this book is a good example of art reflecting life in that the religious world is full of hypocrites who really know little of their religions' historical pasts. Please notice the people who did *NOT* like the book are offended from their Christian standpoints and nothing more.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Serious BrownCoat here, so this was an obvious choice for me to buy when we finally upgraded to Blue-Ray.
0451529308|3.0|I can't say I regret reading this book, since I did enjoy the descriptions of day to day life during a period of time in the U.S. (Civil War era) in which most writings of or about the time, focused on the war.  Also, it is a classic and it's always fun to finally read something you've heard about for years.  I have not seen the Winona Ryder movie version, but I'd like to, just to see how it compares to the book.    Alcott's writing is provincial and preachy, though, and I thought her characters were two dimensional at most.  I can't help imagining Marmee as a statue of the virgin Mary, with a frozen little smile on her face as she peers down on her children scattered around her.  And Dad (what was his name?)!  An image doesn't even form in my head about him.  Jo rejecting Laurie is an interesting twist, but disappointing, especially when she falls for an old stodgy absent minded professor.  Laurie was the only character given human qualities, and I couldn't help liking his grandfather, too.  Beth was just unreal, and Meg was annoyingly subservient (I know, that was how things were back then).  And how many times did her characters blush?  If there was anything the sisters had in common, it was the propensity to change colors at the slightest whim.  Otherwise, their qualities seemed mutually exclusive which, as another reviewer pointed out, doesn't seem realistic for sisters.    To be fair, I realize this was written for a younger crowd than me, so I should not have expected edginess or depth.  So there are my 3 stars.
0756405890|5.0|Truth be known, I pick up this book on a lark. I had just finished Stephen King's \\"The Gunslinger\\" and wanted something to tide me over until I was ready to pick up \\"Drawing of the Three\\", so I did a little digging and found this book.<br /><br />Let me say that I like the book. As a first novel, it's well paced. The world that Patrick creates is engaging and fleshed out. His character are strong and can be heart-breakingly real. While there are a few minor hiccups, the book is just what I needed for a light read.<br /><br />  Pros:<br />  - Well paced.<br />  - Deeply rooted characters.<br />  - Equal amounts of comedy and drama.<br />  - A Rich world that feels like there are more stories than those of Kvothe and his friends.<br /><br />  Cons:<br />  - Jarring shifts between first and third-person.<br />  - It can sometimes feel like the middle of a trilogy and not the beginning.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed the book. It's a wonderful debut novel from a talented writer.<br /><br />I am also excited that the adventures of Kvothe will continue. [[ASIN:0756404738 The Wise Man's Fear (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 2)]].
B002ZG981E|5.0|Chris Nolan delivers another thought provoking movie that actually has good story, character development, action, and special effects.  Dicaprio's character has been accused of murdering his wife and cannot return to America to see his children.  He works to extract information from people via dreams.  The movie centers around an offer from a wealthy business man who can buy Dicarpio's freedom back to the states if Dicaprio agrees to do one more job-plant an idea in someone elses mind.  It is a mix of Matrix and James Bond.  This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.      You cannot miss any part as you may miss a big piece of the plot.
0316067938|5.0|This book zig-zagged all over places that I could not guess at but kept me so entertained that I couldn't put it down.  I love when I can't guess the plot and/or ending from the first page in.  I also loved the grown up twists in it.  I wasn't reading these books as a way to be 18 again but to live in the Cullen's little world for a brief time and am thankful to Ms. Meyers for writing such a well thought out novel.
B004132I4S|5.0|I think everyone knows that this is new take for Sufjan, but after you listen to the CD a couple times (let your mind be open) you find yourself craving to listen to \\"that one song\\" you heard earlier. He knows what he's doing and he did an amazing job with this CD. To Sufjan Stevens newbies it may send them astray, but for those who have stuck with Suffy for awhile, they will still love him and enjoy the CD. Sufjan did showed extreme growth musically and lyrically. He shows that he can go beyond the general view of what his typical music is. Sufjan Stevens will continue to work his magic and give us ear-gasms. :]
B003UESJJC|4.0|\\"The Complete Dossier\\" was a bit of a misleading title. Had it included the magnificent Hearts of Darkness then it would have earned its title, but sadly missing. The sole reason I bought this was for Marlon Brando's recitation of T.S.Eliot's The Hollow Men in it's entirity. The raw disused footage accompanying the reading is appropriately strange.    I have very mixed feelings about the \\"Redux\\" version. I was glad to have seen it on the big screen when it was rereleased. To see Apocalypse Now (in any version) on the big screen is a true experience unto itself. However my joy of seeing this film (which is on my top ten list of all time favorite films) was diminished by some the new footage. All the new stuff with Brando are invaluable and add another dimiension to his character rather than him being this sort of one-dimensional \\"villian'. The scenes involving Willard and his crew stealing a prized surfing board from Kilgore seems just wrong with the mood of the movie. The two worst inclusions are the scenes in the French plantation sequence which brings the entire movie to a screaming halt. If it was shortened and tightened up it might have been tolerable. As it is it is just boring and pointless. The second sequence that need not been included was the encounter with the Playboy bunnies. Another scene that just meanders and adds absolutely nothing new to the actual story.    Some of the deletes scenes on the bonus features section should have included in the new version. The scenes of the patrol boat passing baby crib that is actually a booby trap and another of a sail boat with a crucified man surrounded by severed monkey heads dangling from string are surreal and seem like something out of a Werner Herzog film.   Despite this modern obssession of directors to revisit and tinker around with their old film, Apocalypse Now Redux is by no means the worst (that dubious distinction goes to George Lucas' perverse tinkering with the original Star Wars trilogy) and worth checking out regardless of the shortcomings.
0618918248|5.0|This was great! Dawkins is a \\"man after my own heart,\\" to borrow that excellent phrase from the King James Bible. I could not disagree with anything in this book. If only the world had more people who thought just as rationally instead of clutching onto their delusions.     The book basically delivers on what it sets out to do, detailing the current flash points of the religion vs. science debate. Dawkins takes the main religious arguments that are invariably touted and lays out some standard responses to them. (Actually, it wouldn't be bad having something like this in handbook form!) I don't think it was intended to do more than that, so some reviewers' responses seem a bit harsh, as if they were expecting something else.     One added dimension to this book is the mention of Paster Ted, who had not fallen from grace at the time of its release. You can see Paster Ted in action in Dawkins' [[ASIN:B0015GJ3VA Root of All Evil?]] documentaries, and he also appears in the truly horrifying [[ASIN:B000KLQUV2 Jesus Camp]] documentary. Ted is in top form in both films. It's hilarious to know that after these appearances and his mention in Dawkins' book, Ted was busted for gay sex and a meth habit. I do hope Dawkins updates this book one day with mention of the ups and downs, and ins and outs, of Paster Ted's spiritual progress.    Highly recommended!
B003Y7L5W8|5.0|Finally OMD released another cd.After 15 years they put out a real gem.Depeche Mode constantly recorded but their releases have gotten worse.OMD stayed true to their form:catchy great melodies just like we're used to and the very reason  i caught their attention in the first place back in the late 70s.None of that plastic sound from other groups of that era.There really is not much to say here.Their fans will and cannot be disappointed.This is not one of those \\"few hits and lots of fillers\\" releases.Looking forward to more cds.

B000ZELISO|1.0|This is a terrible movie adaptation of one of the best Harry Potter books in the series, it completely destroys the story, almost word for word this movie is wrong about everything, if you don´t believe me watch it, pause it and compare it to the book, the disregard for the book is apparent in the entire movie, it´s almost like their goal was to make it as different as they could, they misplace the dialogs, cut out vital scenes and include unnecessary ones that add nothing to the story; Dumbledore is a joke, a terrible impression of one of the most beloved characters, he seems to despise Harry instead of being his mentor, he treats him like a child beneath him, his not a caring paternal figure at all in this movie, you are almost glad to see what happens to him at the end. David Yates and his crew ruined this movie and I can´t believe he will make the next ones too. The special effects may look great and all but this is the worst Harry Potter movie ever released, if you are a hardcore Harry Potter books fan stay away from this movie, resist the temptation of wanting to see the characters come to life in the silver screen, you will be very pissed, I guarantee it.
0385342047|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed 'Mini-Shopaholic' and I really think that Sophie should have entitled the book 'Minnie-Shopaholic' since Becky's daughter, Minnie, was a large part of the book and seems to have inherited the buy-buy-buy gene. I laughed out loud many times at Becky's antics and I was pleased that she is back to her old tricks again in this new edition of the series, and I can't wait for the next one. Its an easy entertaining read that didn't fail to please. Becky is a little crazy in the book, but that is what I love about her! Keep writing books about the Becky that we all love Sophie.

0312370849|5.0|The book was suggested for the November meeting of my book club.  The historical setting of the book was interesting and a topic that I knew little about.  It was a tragic story, but yet it was written in an interesting and easy-to-read  manner.  The story line was well developed. The author had a good feel for the emotional turmoil in the lives of the characters in the story.  It is an historical situation that should not be forgotten.

B003XRZZFM|5.0|Like a lot of other bands, Dimmu Borgir has it's followers and naysayers. The naysayers are pretty much two groups of people: those that simply don't favor black metal music at all, and those that used to like the band, but figured they've sold out especially since they've gained a bigger fanbase since Death Cult Armageddon (which was in fact my first cd from these guys). I'm sure that Abrahadabra won't change any minds, but you'll find a lot to enjoy here if you've been listening to them recently. Although not a concept album like In Sorte Diaboli, every track here flows seamlessly together, making for a full experience. To my surprise, this record was mixed and mastered by Andy Sneap (Exodus, Cradle Of Filth, Accept), who has a penchant for helping make unbelievably great sounding metal and rock records. If you are a fan, you definitely need to consider getting this.
B003YOZNBK|2.0|Completely prepared to loathe Jonah Hex, I started watching the film and found myself strangely, loving it. It was unique and violent and full of old west cold-heartedness and then you throw in cool weapons and Jonah Hex's ability to talk to the dead, and you have the capability of a great and memorable movie.<br /><br />The first thing you have to imagine is that Jonah Hex is a comic book movie. It's unrealistic in its truest form. It unreal set in a very real civil war America, where the nation is divided between those who love America and those who think government is out to destroy their freedoms and are fully prepared to bring the country down to secure this.<br /><br />The movie has a nice production value with good effects and fast moving action and a fast moving story, in fact, too fast. The story that is. I can only guess what happened with Jonah Hex. The studio heads and their all knowing money grubbing brains, saw early takes of the film, saw the money that was being spent to blow up a train and probably a bunch of other scenes that were slated to be filmed, and figured that people wouldn't get it, buy it or invest in Jonah Hex and his hard to believe world of old west with technology, and they cut the filmmakers budget, cheapening the production and causing the creators to cut dozens of scenes that made the movie more whole and more involved.<br /><br />Ultimately, Jonah Hex, in its finished form, started off like a movie with great promise as Jonah Hex discovers that his arch nemesis, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), the man who disfigured him and killed his family, is still alive and plotting a large scale attack on the government of America. Yet, somewhere about 30 minutes in, the movie is obviously missing some scenes because there's very little setup as Hex finds Turnbull in a couple of scenes.

B000OVLBEO|5.0|A very good movie.  Loved the special effects shown in this movie.  Would like to get the other DVD with the same title.  Great purchase
B0024FAR5M|1.0|This is my first review of a series or movie.  Normally I pass on the opportunity to cast my vote, but in this instance, after reading so much stellar feedback regarding \\"Sons...\\" I felt compelled to counter what can only be described as mass delusional hysteria.  The characters are one-dimensional, stereotypical, and uninteresting.  There's not a bit of wit or grit in any of them.  The writing is unimaginative, and the scenarios trite and predictable.  There's not a moment that I forgot there are actors, writers (lights, camera, action)in lieu of getting lost in a unique world presented in a dynamic and absorbing way.  The acting, in this case,is wooden and never rises above the flat and uninspired dialogue as it plods along.  The only thing good about it, perhaps, is that if you have any trouble sleeping it'll work better than any sleep aid on the market.  My biggest regret is that there isn't a -1 rating that I could give it.
0312600844|5.0|Two quotes kept echoing in my head throughout my reading of this book.  \\"With great freedom comes great responsibility\\" and \\"freedom is just another word for nothing left to loose\\" For me this book is the tension between these two quotes.     To be totally free is to not have any other person to whom you are accountable. This is played out in Joey, Richard Katz and Walter's brother Mitch. Mitch is a symbol of freedom in the extreme. No responsibilities, can do whatever he wants, but at the same time completely alone. Joey decides \\"softness\\"/ love is worth the loss of freedom. I think Richard ends up somewhere in between.    What of our freedom are we willing to give up in order to love someone? Ironically the more honestly we love someone, and let them see the vilest parts of ourselves (b/c lets face it we all have them, even if we don't like reading about it in others) the more bound we are to them and the less \\"free\\" we are. But is it worth the price? Are our lives not more fully enriched by binding ourselves to others in love? I feel like this is one of the questions of the novel on the micro-level.    On the macro-level comes the discussion of our responsibility as a nation to the environment, to the other people enjoying our planet, to our neighbors. We may have the freedom and privilege to buy huge houses, drive gas-guzzling SUVs, and ignore our neighbors suffering  - but should we be bound by a feeling of responsibility?     I probably learned more about MTR & over-poplulation in this book then I ever wished to know (and found somewhat boring.) But at the same time isn't it my responsibility to be aware? There are so many levels to this discussion and I thank Mr. Franzen for stirring it up, illuminating the complexity and giving me (at least) a glimmer of hope.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|It's hard to make a good action film. It's even harder to make a good comedy. And it's harder still to tell a story that will not only entertain audiences, but also keep them intrigued. Not only does \\"Red\\" successfully achieve all three, it also manages to house it within the context of a graphic novel, a notoriously fanboy-exclusive genre. Fanboys will certainly appreciate this film, but so, I believe, will general audiences; apart from being a fun, thrilling comedy caper, it's also a thoroughly absorbing tale of conspiracy, friendship, loyalty, and yes, even romance. It displays a fair share of comic book violence, and yet it never becomes overpowering, so we can simultaneously revel in the stunts and explosions and pay attention to the plot. It's nice to know that even comic adaptations can be made to appeal to everyone and not merely exist in a closed universe.    Adapted from the graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, \\"Red\\" tells the story of four retired CIA agents who have been marked for death. Exactly who wants them dead and why, they don't yet know. It all begins with a former black-ops agent named Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), who, despite his impeccable service record, has been labeled RED - Retired, Extremely Dangerous. Up until a team of assassins entered his home, he had been living the quite life in a secluded suburban area. He had started a phone relationship with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), who tries to manage his pension from a cubicle in Kansas City; it proved to be an unwise move, for now she's also a target for assassination. Frank kidnaps her for her own good. She's initially frightened by him, although it very quickly becomes apparent that she gets off by living dangerously. She's also one of the few people outside of his inner circle that can handle his witty banter.    The death of a newspaper reporter leads to the discovery of a long hit list. This, in turn, leads to Frank reuniting with his old teammates: Intelligence specialist Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), who languishes in a New Orleans retirement home; spy and camouflage expert Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), who lives in bomb shelter in Pensacola and, after years of undergoing Russian mind-control experiments, has every reason to be hopelessly paranoid; and Victoria (Helen Mirren), now a domestic Martha Stewart-type in Chesapeake, although she often yearns for her old days as a Wetwork special ops agent, where she was proficient with long range weapons. Together, they work towards uncovering a massive conspiracy, one that connects to an assignment they were a part of years earlier.    On their tails is CIA agent William Cooper (Karl Urban), who seems to understand his mission less and less the more he learns about Frank and his team. Far from a villainous cliché, he's a family man who's dedicated to his job yet does possess the ability to think rationally; he's methodical and cunning, but he's also capable of making mistakes, and the more he realizes what Frank is capable of, the less he's inclined to listen to his superiors and carry out his mission. He also realizes, rather harshly, that both he and Frank have the wherewithal to fight for who they love.    The film deftly manages a balancing act between action violence and comedy, helped in no small part by actors who are quite funny. Malkovich is the obvious example, his character a wacky explosion of goofy dialogue and sheer mental instability. But Willis, Freeman, and Mirren shouldn't be forgotten, here; they too reveal a refreshing sense of humor, mostly in relation to how their characters have adapted - or at the very least, have tried to adapt - to retired life. Credit also to Parker, whose surprisingly realistic dialogue is the perfect counterpart to Willis', which is pleasantly silly. Ironically, it's the mildly serious nature of the story that allows the leads to be so funny; had the film been a nonstop joke fest, had there been not a shred of heavy-handedness, the subtle quirkiness of the characters would not have registered. They simply would have disappeared into the background.    Fortunately, the filmmakers found a way to keep every aspect of the movie engaging. Nothing is left to the sidelines, not even the occasional stunt sequence, each lasting long enough to be entertaining but not going on so long that they become boring. Perhaps the best extra touch is a small but memorable guest appearance by Ernest Borgnine, who at age ninety-three looks, moves, and sounds like an actor twenty, nay, thirty years his junior. As the film's tagline says, \\"Still got it.\\" Everyone involved with this film has got it. 2010 has seen the release of several comic book/graphic novel adaptations I enjoyed, including \\"Iron Man 2,\\" \\"The Losers,\\" and \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" (I'm conveniently forgetting the deplorable \\"Kick-Ass\\"). \\"Red\\" is by far the best of them all. It's funny, exciting, and absorbing - a thoroughly entertaining film.

0716703440|5.0|The title of this review says it all.  This book has so any topics in it that the book is as big as your old Freshman General Physics text, if not bigger.  It's 1200+ illustrated pages, in two tracks - basics and special topics.      Everything is written clearly so it's easier to understand, with extremely helpful illustrations.  It's a little dated, and it's too scatter-shot to use as a first text, but as a reference, it's indispensable.  I would recommend the following other books to learn GR for the first time, with this one as a reference:    1) Schutz or Mould (undergrad GR - no lie!)  2) Weinberg (takes a less abstract, more physical approach) or Carroll (I haven't read that one but it gets high marks)  3) Wald (This is an awesome one but advanced - it's basically an update of MTW through the mid-1980's)    After you've learned the subject, I would lean most heavily on this book and on Wald for reference.    It's also good to learn the basics of differential geometry (such as from O'Neil) before taking on relativity.
B0025X5WSU|5.0|Out of all the seasons episodes in The Tudors, season two is my most favorite. Natalie Dormer does an awesome performance as the Lady Anne Bolyen. She ivites you to experince the drama and demands you to pay close attention to her eyes, her words and her actions. It was Ms. Dormer performance that inspired me to watch the Tudors season 1,2, and 3 over and over again. The Tudors is a historic documentry worth watching.
0345505387|1.0|Disgraceful.  A joke.  Ruined the entire series by this last piece of garbage.  She needs to be ashamed of herself for even printing it - what a waste of paper.  Will never read anything she writes again!  Even I could have come up with (based on the previous books) a wonderful \\"next in series\\" book building on the characters.  My suggestion is she shut down her computer, break her pen and throw away her paint brushes!!!
140120841X|5.0|I ordered this book with 4 other Batman graphic novels. I have always been an Alan Moore fan, his works such as Watchmen and The Killing Joke are very provocative and unique.     This graphic novel collects the original graphic novel with some deleted scenes, large collection of artworks and a good afterword. I loved the movie, which was boring in many cases. The book is unique in its on genre. V for Vendetta stars a mysterious freedom fighter codenamed 'V', fights for freedom against a fascist group led my an evil leader. Alan Moore illustrates a wonderful insight on freedom and resistance to fatal moments. The amazing artwork mixed with literature brings a poetic epic to the industry.     Excellent
B002PLALCO|5.0|Wow. Even if your not a Pink fan, you can see this young lady is talented, driven, and very attractive, even to an old dude like me. Seriously, she can really sing, what a great voice. She has a lot of swagger, however she can be very tender also. Great physical shape I might add.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|Depressing. The underlying theme to me is depressing. Also, I'm old school and prefer some sexual content to be left to my imagination (esp. annoyed and nauseated about a character imagining eating one's turds). Environmental, social and political issues I did find a bit informative. Sorry ... hated it ... couldn't wait to get through and on to the next book.
0861661605|4.0|Great book. I've been addicted to Moore ever since i read V for Vandetta and by far i think The Leauge is ihis best work yet. \\"1910\\" is no exception, beautifly drawn, wonderflly bloody (like most good Alan Moore stories the story crecedoes into bloody mayhem) and Moore's story crafting is as masterfull as ever.<br /><br />I would try to find this volume elsewhere, Amazon's price is a few bucks more than the cover price (a shame i normally buy comics on Amazon to save money) and it took quite a while to get here, almost a week and a half later than the estimated date. sort of disapointed by Amazon on this order, but the book is worth the trouble.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Got this for my 3 1/2 year old and she loves it, double feature the 2nd DVD gives all the info about the animals in the story.
B003YOZNBK|3.0|I must say that this was quite a messy and rushed movie that had so much potential but was thrown out as a mass produced commercial film whose only goal was to make money off of comic-book/movie geeks and unsuspecting western/action patrons with just enough curiosity to gander at a comic to film product that may satisfy their hunger for the next great western.  Unfortunately, all the pretty \\"bells and whistles\\" spent in effects and on the horrible Megan Fox could not save this poor excuse of a comic book adaptation. Even the great John Malkovich was sucked into Fox's talentless vacuum by portraying an unconvincing villain that is as intimidating as my next door neighbor's toy poodle.  With all this said, Josh Brolin was one of the redeeming qualities in the film that made it watchable and entertaining.  When I say \\"entertaining\\" I mean in a \\"MST-3000\\" meaning where you sit around with friends and make fun of it while intoxicated on your choice of poison. I believe Brolin knew what he was getting into and said to himself, \\"Screw it!  Im going to have fun with the role while I'm getting paid millions for this turd!!\\". And it really shows in his performance. This is the beauty of the film if you choose to acknowledge it or not. So, if you watch this film with no preconceived notions of a comic book geek or a western/action fanatic you will enjoy the \\"not to be taken seriously\\" JONAH HEX.  BTW, don't forget the alcohol!!!!!!
0425188809|5.0|There is a certain type of reverence many of the reviewers have given this book and with good reason.  It was our introduction to Dean Koontz.  Just as you never forget your first love, you will never forget your first Koontz. In an \\"Afterword\\" Mr. Koontz says more fans comment on this book than any of his others and often ask him to write a sequel.<br /><br />This book is a showcase of a terrific author's talent in all aspects of writing. Characterization, backstory, storyline, dialogue, suspense, pacing and love of all creatures (especially those who bark) written in vivid detail without bogging down the reader with unnecessary drivel just to fill the page.  Polished, edited beautifully. It sparkles like a diamond esp. when compared to some of the overhyped, under talented authors published today. (Justin Cronin--The Passage--take note).<br /><br />If you have forgotten just how wonderful a great read can be, pick this one up.  Whether you check it out from the library, borrow it from a friend, or put it on your Christmas list you will not regret it.<br /><br />Enjoy the read!
B001GCUO5W|5.0|This really is a return to form in many ways, for Scorcese the film-maker.  We're in Cape Fear territory here, inasmuch as our Martin clearly wants to show off his directorial skills, and his movie knowledge.  This is not a case of the director being invisible to the process to serve the story - here he is key in using all sorts of tricks and magic to entertain and surprise, visually, aurally and narratively.  Movie referencing is rife (look for the scene running up the stairs in the lighthouse, then go watch Vertigo again), and the nature of the story itself lends itself to some startling imagery.  So what's it about?  Well, the less said going in to the movie the better.. suffice to say, that DiCaprio (on blistering form) and his colleague (Mark Ruffalo - understated yet also excellent in the role) arrive in 1954 on the eponymous island as two Marshalls, sent to investigate reports of a missing person.  The island is a sanatorium for the criminally insane, lending a creepy and unsettling atmosphere from the first moment it appears through the mists.  They meet the doctors, Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow in their wonderfully Gothic setting, crackling fireplace and thundery soundtrack from the brewing storm.  However, as time goes by, DiCaprio feels his grip on reality loosening.  Is there a conspiracy on the island?  Is his past trauma in the war catching up with him?  Why do the facts signally fail to add up?  It's a great build - and even, if some have said, the plot is somewhat easy to guess at early on, the machinations to get there never fail to be interesting at the least, and mesmerising if like me you really get into the atmosphere of the movie.  Much credit to maintaining the atmosphere goes to the cinematography which is simply magnificent, lending an eerie, sepia toned hue to the period setting, and yet some startling colour imagery in the dream scenes.  The soundtrack too should get an honourable mention, using  modern classical music to create the offkilter feel, rather than one sound from one composer to unite the tone.  You really get the feeling that Marty was enjoying himself to bits making this - if giving him an Oscar encourages him to have this much fun without the weight of expectation, for goodness sake give him another one.    Bluray serves this movie very well - the clarity of those sounds, the storm, even the aforementioned crackle of the fireplace, all feel exactly where they should be, and the images are so vivid and startling in high definition it's worth going blu on this one.  If I didn't have a BR player already, this may well be the one that would tempt me to get one.  In a nutshell, this is utterly brilliant - at the same time revelling in the love of cinema of old, while adding his own distinctive Scorcese touch, topped with a performance from DiCaprio which roots you in the drama, this is one for those who love pure cinema.  It's eminently watchable, and as the best movies are, eminently rewatchable too.  Recommended.
159562015X|3.0|just got it for having access to Gallup online test. Honestly I had read \\"Now discover your strenghts\\" before and it seems to me that \\"Strenghtfinder2.0\\" does not add too much...
B0034G4OVS|3.0|Frozen<br /><br />When a suspense film elects to keep everything realistic, that is to rely on real world conditions and threats over supernatural ones to create the horror and fear, one of the risks taken by the filmmakers is believability.  In Frozen, the low budget effort detailing the experiences of thee college aged friends trapped on a ski lift, potentially for a week, the situation and feeling of being trapped is well done, but the way the kids get into the situation stretches credibility beyond thin. Their hounding by a pack of wolves and poorly writen dialouge further weakens the effort as a whole.  The film is, as many of these cheaper creations tend to be, over acted, too situational, and appears molded out of a set of conditions (I can get us access to a ski resort ski lift, we have enough money for a crane, and my buddy knows this guy who has trained wolves - what could we do with that?) rather than being a fully created story first. Anyone who skis regularly will be sharing looks of \\"that would not happen\\" throughout the first half hour of this film.<br /><br />Despite the absence of ski patrols, following basic protocol, seat lifting, and a myriad of other oddities in the set up, once you get the archtype characters stuck on the lift, you get a stretch of story-telling that is very effective.  The need to escape leads to desperate actions, and it is in these moments that you finally connect with the human inside each character. You don't really need to bother to know the names of the victims here. They are played as types. The Boyfriend, his Best Friend, and the Girlfriend - who has changed the relationship between the males with her very presence. Go ahead, place your bets, which one will go first?  If you can't pick it, you have not watched much TV. Of course the first one down does it the dumb way and really gets hurt.  This section of the film is the best 30 minutes, enough to lift the film from a \\"don't bother\\" to a \\"maybe you should\\".  Once the wolves show up, however, the plot doesn't thicken so much as freezes. Silly angry moments (did they choose the actors rejected from 90210?)  and a very big \\"Maybe the should have tried that first\\" moment makes the final 30 of this effort a head scratcher, though the last one's method of escape is a nice moment of irony worth the wait.  If you are a guy who has a gal who is a little too terrified by horror film, this has enough fearful moments in it to get some \\"hold me\\" hugs, making this a good \\"date\\" film if you've been together for a while.<br /><br />I would not recommend the film as something you should own, but as a rental - it's ok.  If you expected some rad skiing and boarding however, you came to the wrong ski slope.however, the plot doesn't thicken so much as freezes.

Afterwards, I just inserted the memory and properly seated the memory in it's socket. After powering up a test of the system showed I had the extra memory. I may never need the extra memory. But it's their if I need it. And the price was to good to pass up. inexpensive and Kingston is a great brand memory. Plus fast delivery.

0525951652|4.0|I quite enjoyed this latest effort by Ken Follett. It is easy to read and although there are a large number of characters it is not hard to keep track of them and their relationships. I liked the way the author gives you insight into life in the early twentieth century dealing with everything from how coal was mined to the construction of fortifications on the eastern and western fronts. It is unfortunate that the other two volumes of the trilogy are not available now as the ending of this volume left me a little flat flat.

B001BPQT8A|5.0|This is probably THE definitive serial killer film. I use to think [[ASIN:B000MGB6N2 The Silence of the Lambs [Blu-ray]]] was the best, but after watching my new Blu Ray copy I have to say that this is the better drama.     I remember when this played in theaters it so un-nerved me that I went back the next day to see it again. On second viewing it occurred to that the 'city,' which is a major part of the movie is un-named; it is a horrid place and I thought that Fincher did not want to associate it with any 'real' city; in the special features in this new disc that is exactly what happened.     I've been very impressed with Fincher ever since [[ASIN:B00012FXB8 Alien 3 (Collector's Edition)]] (Note: NOT the 114 minute theatrical release but the 155 minute version Fincher delivered to the studio that then ruined it. The 'good' version is, I think, on this collector's edition, in the so-called 'Quadrilogy' and in the new Blu Ray, properly named, 'Alien Anthology'). Anyway, sorry for the rant, Fincher has gone on to make some of the classic films of the past few years.    The special features on this release are alright, nothing really special, but worth the extra money. Kevin Spacey's performance is down right chilling. An excellent buy.    Now for a gripe at Amazon. Why do they combine all reviews of a movie no matter which version you are thinking of buying? Some of the negative reviews here relate to a poorly done transfer for the European market. Others relate to other editions. It isn't just this movie, it's all reviews on a movie, book, product, no matter which version are lumped. I recently bought a Kindle book that had very negative reviews due to a bad tech transfer; the author/publisher had fixed all the problems and then gone through all the negative reviews one at a time to explain that they had been fixed. Why not just have Amazon delete those or clearly show they relate to another version?     My glowing review here is for the new Blu Ray version that was specifically supervised by David Fincher.
031606792X|1.0|Bad plot, poor sentence structure, one dimensional characters and still everything works out in the end, how cliche.  Still committing thesaurus rape, SM tries to weave her fractured pieces of a saga into a \\"grand finale\\" but fails miserably.  Honestly, by the time I got to Breaking Dawn I could hardly care less but I had hoped (I know, pretty stupid, huh?) that the ends would tie up nicely and there would be some sort of satisfaction, especially on the heels of Eclipse which seemed the best book of the whole stinking lot.  But *sigh* no, that was not meant to be.<br /><br />Since the plot of this saga was weak to begin with, SM threw in two crafty but obvious plot devices to beef up this novel, tons of extra characters (also one dimensional) and additional narrative in the form of Jacob, who is still as insightful and entertaining as a twig.  I actually skimmed through his narration to make certain I wasn't missing any big plot twists (I know, pretty funny right?) and still this sham of a novel dragged on endlessly.  Jacob's point of view adds absolutely nothing to story and pulls the reader out with his nonsensical narrative and choppy transitions.<br /><br />Edward, still creepy and a misogynist, and Bella, still whiney and bratty, finally get hitched and have sex.  Whooppeee!  And that didn't even spice things up.  I never believed the love story in this saga, to me it was a co-dependent, abusive relationship that left me feeling sorry for any young girl who would ascribe to the notion that love means the forfeiture of one's integrity and self-esteem.  There are no redeeming qualities about this series and certainly not this book, the worst of the four, which is saying a lot.  Again, this is four days of my life, and countless brain cells, I will never see again.<br /><br />I simply don't get it, perhaps I never will, I had hoped that by sitting down and reading all four of these dreadful books I would get a glimpse into a world which has so clearly delighted most of the ovary bearing population.  Sadly, I haven't.  Perhaps I should see a gynecologist to make certain everything's okay.<br /><br />Anyway, I digress, the stories are all flat, the prose are ridiculously over the top, the editing is shabby and I was left holding a dead tree wondering why SM hated nature so much.  Do Mormons hate trees?  Is there some biblical connotation I'm unaware of?  But at least it's over now - or is it?  Please... no more!population.  Sadly, I haven't.

B003W5C0VM|4.0|Ok, I have had many bootleg copies of this film over the years and it is unbelievable; the Stones at their best.  The sad thing here is that after 35 years of waiting what was released appears to be a direct film transfer without any corrections.  The Blu-Ray version contains scratches, film discolorations, specks, dust and drop-outs in the soundtrack.  Why after all of this time and with today's technology would they not fix these things?  Mick Jagger on the 2010 commentary mentions that they spent quite a bit of money to repair and restore the film deterioration from years of neglect.  Why go through that much trouble but still have scratches and whatnot very obvious in the finish product?  Also, the on the bonus features why not include the entire footage from the rehearsals?  They left out about half of it.  I don't get it but non-the-less I am still enjoying this greatly.  I have to deduct a star due to the poor remastering job.  Get it anyway!!!!

B0045EC05A|4.0|I was expecting total disappointment from Antony on this one. When I first heard \\"Hope There is Someone\\" in late 2004, I almost instantly welled up with tears; it was so powerfully, nakedly emotional, so unique and inspiring. I soon soaked up everything I could by Antony, including his various guest appearances on others' albums. And I loved everything he did. It's as if everything featuring his voice was instant gold.<br /><br />2009's \\"The Crying Light\\" was a bit of a rude awakening for me, then. Many people praise that album as either equal or superior to \\"I am a Bird Now,\\" but I see it as stiff and stuffy, a forced and awkward continuation of familiar themes; a parody of his former glory. It had a few moments of true beauty, but largely it seemed as if Antony was trading the fire of his art for a status as a \\"mature\\" artist.<br /><br />When the single \\"Thank You for Your Love\\" was recently released, I felt as if my fears for Antony's fate were sealed. Here was more uninspired mimicry of his older songs: in this case, a more than passing resemblance to the far superior \\"Fistful of Love,\\" as well as VU's \\"Candy Says\\" (which Antony has covered).<br /><br />I am happy to say, then, that the album \\"Swanlights\\" is not well represented by its lead single. While not as daring as I'd like it to be, this new album makes Antony sound fresh again, and thank goodness for that.<br /><br />Spacious, serene, mysterious, and boasting a wide vocal range--even dipping into the major key! Antony is singing out to the back row once again, something he hasn't done since his eponymous debut. And this one feels very cohesive, even though it's actually quite erratic.<br /><br />Here's a breakdown of the tracks:<br /><br />1) Everything is New: A fantastic opener. It's no Hope There is Someone, but thankfully it's not trying to be. Both meditative and explosive, it really sets the tone for the rest of the album.<br /><br />2) The Great White Ocean: This could be better. I think it really would have sounded great with some more emphasis on drones and ethereality, but instead we get a baroque minstrel-type feel with a cheesy guitar that sounds like it came from The Princess Bride.<br /><br />3) Ghost: Has the feel of late 60's Scott Walker, a gorgeous mix of light and dark tones. Love it!<br /><br />4) I'm In Love: This is a strange one. It's peppy and soulful, but the arrangement is hypnotic, and a bit sinister. Quite the ear worm.<br /><br />5) Violetta: A brief instrumental. Not much on its own, but it provides some punctuation to the album.<br /><br />6) Swanlights: Psychedelic and very eerie. I wish he would have played around with other songs on the album as he does here (especially track 2).<br /><br />7) The Spirit Was Gone: A good track. Kind of a meditative tone poem, like the opener. Brief and opaque, but the melody does sound a lot like \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" by the Beatles.<br /><br />8) Thank You For Your Love: As a single, this was disappointing. Now that I know that this sound doesn't reflect the rest of the album, though, it's okay to listen to. It's derivative and overly simplistic, but it is nice to hear Antony sounding so joyous at the end.<br /><br />9) Fletta: A duet with with Bjork. Quirky yet pretty. Lovable and mystical.<br /><br />10) Salt Silver Oxygen: The lyrics are quite odd, but this track grew on me. It's like a weirder, slightly darker cousin of Ghost. Or like \\"The Crying Light\\"'s Everglade redone in the style of his debut album.<br /><br />11) Christina's Farm: A nice closer. Brings back themes from the first song, but with some added levity and sobriety. Almost like the moment of waking from the dream of the previous tracks.<br /><br />I'm still hoping that Antony pushes his art further than what he's doing here (is he afraid of drum machines?), but \\"Swanlights\\" offers a unique world of sounds and feelings that is a pleasure to inhabit.<br /><br />I've missed you, friend.

0143118420|1.0|Okay, I've been kicking myself to finish reading this for a month for my book club.  This is a book all about discovering self identity and self concept which makes me want to gag given, a woman of her age should already be there.  It just is not entertaining written in the voice she uses which fails to invite her readers into the who what why when and how of how she arrived at the point of no where at this late stage in life.  This would have allowed readers to connect and identify with her.  I understand this is a memoir of her journey but she could have written it with a common thread to tie it together to make it more cohesive for her readers.  In my opinion, it rambles aimlessly and I don't think I will be able to finish reading it.
030726999X|3.0|To finish up Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, I recently read The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  I liked The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo immensely, but The Girl Who Played With Fire was a bit of a letdown.  It didn't have the same pace and intricacies, and the ending was a bit too far-fetched for me.  Hornet's Nest picks up right where Fire leaves off, with Lizbeth in the hospital and the doctors trying to save her life after the gunshot wound to the head.  Even though it's been determined that her brother was responsible for a number of deaths that she was suspected of, she's been charged with a number of other crimes associated with her attempt to find (and probably kill) her father.  So as soon as she's considered healed, she's to be carted off to prison to await trial.  Blomkvist's sister is serving as her lawyer, and of course trying to represent someone as cynical and untrusting as Lizbeth is difficult, to say the least.  It also doesn't help that some group is out to destroy evidence and eliminate Blomkvist before he can publish the full story that will clear Lizbeth and create a scandal that reaches to the highest levels of the Swedish government.  The story builds to a final confrontation in court between the prosecutor who wants to lock her away, a psychiatrist who wants the same, and her attorney, who has a few bombshells to let loose during the trial.<br /><br />I was hoping for a rebound from Fire, one that would have me as fascinated as Dragon did.  But it was not to be.  Hornet's Nest seemed to drag in a number of spots, and the book could have been a third shorter without losing any of the story.  The second and more annoying thing to me was the final scene in the court room.  I'll leave open the possibility that what happened there is normal in the Swedish legal system.  But based on our own judicial system, most of what occurred would have never been allowed.  Both sides were withholding evidence from the other, and that led to a number of Perry Mason-like moments of high drama.  While it plays well in film and story-telling, it's a fantasy.  Police reports, medical reports, surveillance movies...  you name it.  Although it was emotionally satisfying to see Lizbeth get the justice she was seeking, I couldn't get past the fact that it wouldn't have happened that way.<br /><br />If you've invested the time to get through the first two books, definitely read this one to finish the story.  I realize that my view of the book is definitely in the minority of opinions expressed.  Your mileage may vary, and probably will.  I was just hoping for something similar in style and pace to the first book of the trilogy, and I didn't get it.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedson-like moments of high drama.

B003TXSF5C|3.0|I loved A Brief History of Time back in the day.  Grand Design; not so much.  It just seemed... unfocused, yet very narrow.  I know, odd pairing, but we spent SO much time on the double slit experiment, and after a while, I just didn't see where we were going, or what we arrived at when I turned the last page.  I should have been able to read it in about 1 night, but I kept drifting off or losing interest, so it took nearly a week.  I'd pass on it.
0393072231|4.0|My innocence and belief in the foundations of free-market capitalism has slowly eroded over the last decade, starting with the implosion of Enron (where I worked) to the financial crisis we currently find ourselves in.  Michael Lewis's book The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine continues that trend and shaved a few more layers off of my trust of government and corporations, specifically financial institutions.  Bottom line... greed is rampant, and there is no accountability left out there.<br /><br />Lewis chronicles the meltdown of the sub-prime mortgage market, and subsequently the entire global financial system,  through the eyes and stories of a small number of individuals who were willing to say the emperor had no clothes.  They were convinced that the loan practices of mortgage lenders were seriously flawed, and that the availability of large adjustable mortgages with low teaser rates to people who couldn't afford them would cause high levels of default when the teaser rates expired.  Furthermore, these loans were being packaged and sold to others who would assume the risk, so there was no accountability in making sure the loan was sound, as the lender would not be on the hook over the life of the loan.  These loan bonds were then repackaged again into other \\"investment\\" instruments that were again bought and sold.  The complexity and opacity of the packages led the rating agencies to assign high ratings to instruments that were nothing more than junk.  You could think of it as a large Ponzi scheme, where everything worked so long as housing prices continued to increase.  But when prices went down, everything collapsed in spectacular fashion.<br /><br />The people that Lewis follows established a way that they could short the mortgage bonds, something that hadn't been possible before.  They were lone (and obnoxious) voices in the wilderness, as no one could believe that these few individuals could see something that eluded the view of all the huge financial firms.  But when everything collapsed in September of 2008, they made *huge* profits while the multi-billion dollar financial firms lost tens of billions (and some went bankrupt).  But even having been proved right, they each suffered their own emotional breakdown and turmoil.  The magnitude of the collapse amazed even them, and left them wondering if there was any safe place left for their own money.  In their cases, money definitely didn't buy happiness.<br /><br />The Big Short does a good job of chronicling the greed and ignorance of the finance industry, where profits were everything, and complete understanding of risks was non-existent.  I found it amazing that individuals who brought down companies single-handedly (one trader lost 9 *billion* dollars completely on his own) were still able to leave or resign with millions in their pockets.  Our government bailed out private firms and shifted their losses to us, the American taxpayer, because these firms had sabotaged the financial stability of the nation through their obsession with profits.  And ultimately, no one is really accountable, as those who had to \\"resign\\" did so with millions in payouts.<br /><br />As with all books that look back like this, the knowledge of the outcome allows the story to be told in such a way that the eventual end seems predetermined to happen.  At the time, any single decision made along the way could have turned out differently and this specific story would have never been told and experienced.  Even so, Lewis weaves a compelling narrative of what *did* happen, and one can't help but be depressed at some level knowing that these lessons will soon be forgotten, new people will come up with new schemes driven by greed, and we'll repeat the cycle once again...<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedhen everything collapsed in September of 2008, they made *huge* profits while the multi-billion dollar financial firms lost tens of billions (and some went bankrupt).

B00006RU5B|5.0|Just plain excellent album!    Every so often I plug this in and there it stays for days, on repeat!  The entire cd is awesome, from beginning to end.      5 stars, if I could give it 6 I would!
0817439390|2.0|I've really practiced photography for approximately six months (before I only had compacts), and found out that this book had very little to give to me. If you already own a DSLR and understand how aperture affects depth of field and sharpness, skip this one.
B000001G5A|5.0|I currently own 6 versions of Mozart's Requiem, and I'll review them here.<br /><br />1. My current favorite is Bohm's: [[ASIN:B000001G5A Mozart: Requiem]]. It possesses all the virtues of Karajan or Bernstein's, with the recording quality enjoyed by Abbado's. Highly recommended. Back-story: I though five versions were enough; then a friend criticized this recording, saying, \\"Bohm conducts Mozart as if he were Brahms.\\" Well, that, I thought, is exactly the how I like it! If you don't, well, then skip this one, as well as the Bernstein and the Karajan.<br /><br />2. My former favorite was Bernstein's: [[ASIN:B000001GAO Mozart - Requiem / McLaughlin, M. Ewing, Hauptmann, Bayerischen Rundfunks, Bernstein]]. (It is also availabe in a box set of Bernstein's recordings of Mozart, which I'd heartily recommend to anyone: [[ASIN:B000TM0H66 Mozart: The late Symphonies; Great Mass in C minor; Requiem [Box Set]]].) I cannot say that this is perfect, but it is the way I like to hear the Requiem: slow, stately, and solemn. I don't think anyone excited about the principles of period performance is going to like it, but I believe if Mozart had the resources available to a modern orchestra, he'd want to hear something like this.<br /><br />3. About 15 years ago I decided to learn about classical music - not because I actually enjoyed it, but because I wanted to be a cultural person. One of the first recordings that I genuinely loved was Karajan's [[ASIN:B000001GBY Mozart: Requiem]]. I actually prefer the music here to Bernstein's: it is even more beautiful and moving. It hurts me to subordinate this to anything, but unfortunately this recording is older and fuzzier than Bernstein's. The individual singing parts and instrumental lines are much clearer in the Bernstein. If you have a decent modern stereo system, or fancy headphones, you would want to hear the Bernstein at least occasionally for its clarity. Also, to be fair to Bernstein, there are moments where I prefer his version. (Be careful. If you live abroad this recording is also available with a Byzantine icon on the cover. But there is at least one other recording by Karajan of Mozart's Requiem, which is not the same as this one, and I don't own. Pay attention to the names of the soloists and you'll be fine. DG seems dedicated to fooling people into purchasing multiple editions of the same recording.)<br /><br />4. Abbado: [[ASIN:B00001X59K Mozart - Requiem / Mattila, Mingardo, Schade, Terfel, Berlin Phil., Abbado]] This recording is by far the most clear. If you want to hear the distinct parts, the instrumentation, as if you were standing on the podium, this is the recording for you. It is played faster than I like, but it retains most of the emotional power. Comparing this recording to Bernstein's is very instructive: I'm sure Abbado took fewer liberties, and purists will prefer this one.<br /><br />5. In Brilliant Classic's [[ASIN:B000BLI3K2 Mozart Edition: Complete Works (170 CD Box Set)]], it is conducted by Nicol Matt and performed by various Dutch artists. The music is not recorded as well as the Bernstein or Abbado above, and it is taken too fast. Yet I still enjoy listening to this one for contrast.<br /><br />6. Gardiner: [[ASIN:B0000040YU Mozart: Requiem / Bonney, von Otter, Blochwitz, W. White, Gardiner]]. This is a recording only a mother - or a very serious enthusiast of period performance - could love. It is played far too fast, the instrumentation is much too thin. I cannot enjoy this, and I don't think I've sat all the way through it more than twice. (Notice that the enthusiastic reviewers of this one talk about \\"accuracy\\" and \\"authenticity\\" and so on rather than \\"beauty\\" or \\"power.\\" Well, that's their thing, and I'm glad they have a recording to love. But it doesn't work for me.)<br /><br />I hope to consider more as my collection grows.

B002ZG981E|5.0|I know a movie critic isn't supposed to summarize at the beginning of his review, but I'll come right out and say it right now: \\"Inception\\" is the best film of the year! Now, I know there are at least another five months left in the year, but I've viewed the upcoming releases and, besides Ben Affleck's [[ASIN:B002ZG99NG The Town (Extended Cut Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]] and/or David Fincher's \\"The Social Network\\" having the only chance of disproving my statement, trust me, there aren't any more contenders. So I'm safe in calling this right now. With its movie trailers that recall shades of [[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]] and [[ASIN:B0018O4YT0 Dark City (Director's Cut)]], \\"Inception\\" is brought to us by one of the best filmmakers today, Christopher Nolan (the man behind the successful - finally! - reboot of the Batman franchise). And while \\"Inception\\" does have a mind-altering plot like \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Dark City,\\" that's where the similarities end. The only description I will give besides stating that it's a cool heist noir film that balances drama, action and science fiction with one master stroke, is that the film revolves around a group of dream extractors lead by Dominic \\"Dom\\" Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who rather than extract information from a target's mind, are hired to implant an idea in a new corporate leader's (Cillian Murphy) head, hence the title \\"Inception.\\"<br /><br />Besides DiCaprio and Murphy, the rest of the cast are also spectacular: Joseph Gordon-Levitt (one of my favorite actors), Marion Cotillard, Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Tom Berenger, Dileep Rao, and brief appearances by Michael Caine, Lukas Haas, and Pete Postlethwaite. Nolan has always been blessed with great actors in all of his films ([[ASIN:B0000640SA Memento (Widescreen Two-Disc Limited Edition)]], [[ASIN:B003LR5BD0 Insomnia]], [[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]], and the aforementioned Batman movies), so it's really no surprise that he gets the best performances. It also helps that Nolan is one of the best contemporary screenwriters and it is evidenced in all of his works. I heard that he is shepherding the next Superman film and, after first reading up on it, I was a little nervous because I've heard reports of him and screenwriter David Goyer handling it like it's never been done before. However, after viewing Inception, I am completely comfortable with his handling a character for which I have such a strong affection.<br /><br />It's surprising to hear that for many of the film's spellbinding (and mindbending) sequences, rather than using CGI, Nolan insisted on placing the actors on actual rotating sets, making the action look real. And I'm grateful he did; it shows in the film's overall production value. In a day when films are bogged down with CGI and little - or recycled - plot (ahem, \\"Avatar\\"), it's something really special when a film not only makes you think on an intellectual level, but also delivers a fresh story with emotional depth. As I said in my review for [[ASIN:B003XKPPOU Toy Story 3 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]], James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" is visually and technically stunning but its story is extremely predictable just from watching the trailer, it's uninspiring and trite (the story being a recycled product of several films, most notably Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, and even Cameron's own earlier, better release The Abyss, which focused more on emotion rather than special effects). And that's where most films are headed nowadays. That's why when films like Inception come along, it's important to embrace them ... especially when it's well written and well acted such as this. I know the technical aspects of a film are important as well, but, above all, CGI and special effects should never take precedence or drown out a film's story. Fortunately, Inception perfectly balances the mindblowing special effects and story.<br /><br />Yes, there are plenty of special effects in this film, but the real standout aspect to this film is its story - it's original and captivating with a plot that keeps you biting your nails right until the end. I've heard some reviews and reactions from people saying that this film is confusing and difficult to follow; I couldn't disagree more. The film is involved and you do need to actually think and pay attention to the story, but if you do, there is no confusion. My only advice would be that if you have to use the restroom during this two-and-a-half hour masterpiece, make sure you're either with someone or sitting near someone who can explain to you what you missed because you'll need to know. There are more than two different realities in this film so you'll definitely need to pay attention; this isn't some film you go to with friends and talk to during the entire film and yet still can follow what's happening.<br /><br />Nolan's original work proves that he should be doing more original projects (aside from his debut, \\"Following,\\" all of his films have either been a remake of a film or based on a novel or comic), and I can only hope that there are more in store in the near future. As I stated earlier, the action is paced very well without overloading the senses and it keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through the journey with DiCaprio and company until the end. The concept of time in a dream state as well as other aspects of dreaming are intriguingly explored without dumbing down dialogue and explanations to insult the audience's intelligence, but, at the same time, is not so much complex that you need an encyclopedia to view the film.<br /><br />\\"Inception\\" provides lush visuals, a uniquely stylish story and a range of emotions that should make every great film. After viewing this film, a friend wrote me, telling me to drop anything I was doing and go see \\"Inception\\" because there was nothing more important. Well, that's a bit extreme (no offense to him!). However, \\"Inception\\" is a must-see and if anyone were to ask me, I'd say without hesitation that it's the best film of 2010.m is its story - it's original and captivating with a plot that keeps you biting your nails right until the end.

0307346617|4.0|I don't know what I expected when I bought this book. It caught my eye in the store but I didn't buy it, I looked it up online, saw the positive reviews & put it on my list of books to read. This is not your normal horror, suspense, on the edge of your seat kind of books. It follows the usual theme of zombies. Decaying, moaning, have to destroy the brain to kill them, eating human flesh type of thing. However, what makes this story so different is that it reads like a historical documentary. The same way you might read different accounts of World War II from military, different countries, civilians, etc. Except in this case you are reading about a worldwide outbreak that turns people into zombies & the fight to stop them. Some parts of the book focus on civilians trying to escape, others on military strategy, soldiers in the field, leaders of different countries, & even people up in a space station looking down at the events unfolding. There are times when this can get a little slow but even then you still have to stop & remind yourself that this wasn't real. That's what makes this book scary. When you are done, you feel like it's absolutely possible that this could happen. The author takes one of the big horror legends & turns into something that seems so completely logical & capable of happening that it leaves you feeling oddly uneasy. A great read!
0316077054|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. I liked the first, but this one kept a better pace, and it answered a lot of the lingering questions from before. They also threw in several unexpected twists and turns that really kept those pages turning!
0451169514|3.0|Not exactly scary(although it could have been...BOO!!!) what with all the boring minutia and irrelevant detail to wade through, but very entertaining at times.  I loved the clown though.  FYI...\\"Pogo\\" the clown(John Wayne Gacy) was a real clown that killed kids. He was photographed with Rosalyn Carter, to the Secret Service's embarrassment.<br /><br />I had heard so much about this book, but once into it, you realize it's really a hybrid of a kid's fairy tale/monster movie(what? no Dracula??) on steroids, with adult material included.  And a neighborhood bully thrown in for good measure.  As with most SK novels, you must suffer through boring gunky to get to the good stuff. An improvement would be to have the clown make his appearance more frequently. If only I had lived next door to Stephen King when he wrote this, I'd have admonished him to... SEND IN THE CLOWNS!!!<br /><br />Near the end of the novel, when they're in the sewers, I had a hard time knowing if they were adults or as kids in the sewers--there was little hint as to which, except for the time stamp.  If I thought it was one, it was the other.  And when the giant pregnant black widow appeared, the metaphysics was mind-boggling.  King must've been doing some really good ganja or coke at the time.  In addition, spiders don't have stingers, they have fangs that inject poison.  (the ganja)  If only Steve had stuck with the clown killer theme, the book could've been much scarier and believable, which after all, is what we seek in a SK book.  As it is, IT is on par with the child crusades, or perhaps Harry Potter.  (Although I never read any Harry Potter)  In addition, I saw nothing redemptive in the gang bang--unless King was trying for a banned book.  Ironically, Catcher in the Rye was banned, yet \\"It\\" was far more disturbing and escapes the censors unscathed.  In fact, I wonder how many kids have read \\"It\\" and tried some of the things in It--like binge drinking, gang bang trains, switch blade assaults, rock throwing, physical mutilation, sewer exploration, etc.<br /><br />The final scene was rediculous--riding an old bike, double, at break-neck speed.  The final pages were the hardest to get through.  Looking, but not finding, anything stimulating.  Where's a clown when you need one?<br /><br />I'm not even sure if \\"It\\" belongs in the Horror section.  It may rightly belong in the Fantasy or Sci Fi section.  It's too racy for the Children's section.  Too childish to be in the Adult section--one little gang bang isn't quite enough.  It might float in the Humor section.  Hmmmmm...if only there was an \\"It\\" section.<br />Vitriolic wit aside, there's still a quality story here.  I would say read up to page 500 and stop.  For sure there's nothing good in the last 200 pages.

B00456PKG4|4.0|If you know what to expect, its a great movie. This is definitively not a very intelectual challenging movie. But it is not intended to be one. It has good action and some good jokes.   If you are looking for a movie for relaxing without having to think too much, this movie is great. I enjoyed it a lot because I knew what to expect.
0765326353|5.0|I haven't been this excited about a book in years.  I could feel all the way through this story that Sanderson was just laying the foundation of this epic and I worried it would end unsatisfactorily, but despite the open questions that have me craving the next book, I am pretty content with the partial denouement provided.  I always enjoy maps, but this book also has a handful of cool illustrations and a glossary.  I was afraid to read the latter until I finished the book, but I think there is only one minor spoiler (although the only way to know for sure is to read it first and see if it spoils...)    All in all, I loved this book!
0240816250|5.0|This is the most thorough phtography book I have ever seen. It covers a wide variety subject matter. For me it will be a valuble reference source. More importantly it will be a source of inspiration and encourage experimentation in traditional photography. In addition I enjoy well made books and quality reproduction. This book has it. I reccomend this book to anyone interested in understanding the technical aspects of analog photography or a desire to discover new techniques.

These are good quality all-digital recordings, mostly made in the 1990s, of Netherlands performers whose names are not familiar to me.  Since we have a particular affection for the harpsichord, three of the disks we've played were on that instrument.  To our ears the modern reproductions of period harpsichords used for these disks sound quite authentic -- and we've numerous performances on actual period harpsichords at the Yale Collection of Musical Instruments so we have some notion what the real things sound like.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|RED is the action-comedy about a small group of retired CIA field operatives (Retired, Extremely Dangerous...R.E.D.) who are targeted for elimination by nefarious government groups and must team up to fight off the threat and reveal the culprit.<br /><br />RED is a silly but very fun movie.  It is the sort of movie that would not work, however, if we didn't already have pretty strong impressions and feelings about its stars.  If we didn't already think of Helen Mirren as the classy actress who won an Oscar for THE QUEEN...we wouldn't laugh simply at the sight of her wielding a machine gun.  If we didn't mostly think of Morgan Freeman for playing God or the President or the silky-toned narrator of MARCH OF THE PENGUINS...we wouldn't chuckle at his antics.  Quite frankly, if you enjoyed the trailers for RED, you'll enjoy the movie.  They give you an almost complete sense of the tone of this film.  If you thought the trailers looked merely silly and made you roll your eyes...then the movie will simply multiply that feeling.<br /><br />Personally, I thought it was a lot of fun.  The actors are clearly having a ball, and Bruce Willis (who doesn't really come across as old enough to be retired...especially when he can still win fistfights left and right) makes a good host.  He's coasting here, but as movie-goers, we're so comfortable with Willis and his shaved head that it feels a little like we're just visiting an old friend.  Mary Louise Parker (WEEDS) is his sort-of love interest, a call center worker he's been flirting with long distance but who now joins in on the escapades.  She does a nice job evolving from meek to really enjoying the dangerous antics.  Mirren and Freeman are fun.  Brian Cox shows up as a retired Soviet agent, and he sparkles in his over-the-top accent.  Richard Dreyfuss appears in a couple of scenes and chews scenery.  You have to almost feel sorry for Karl Urban as the assassin on Willis' trail...he doesn't get to have much fun...but he acquits himself well.  I can almost envision him doing well as the star of a straight-laced action series on CBS.<br /><br />Best of all is the hilarious John Malkovich.  He steals every scene he's in with amazing ease.  As the craziest of the REDs, he gets to let his tendencies to overact mightily just run wild...and it all works.  His facial expressions alone had the audience in stitches.<br /><br />RED is not a classic film by any means.  But I must say, the 110 minutes I spent with these guys was a complete, guilty-pleasure blast.  Maybe I'm just the right age (46) to enjoy this particular cast goofing around...but I sure noticed a lot of happy looking teens and 20-somethings all around me.

B0034G4OVS|2.0|***mild spoilers***<br /><br />I would give you a synopsis but in theory you've made it this far so you know the gist: two guys and a girl worm their way onto a ski lift as the park is closing for \\"one last ride\\" and the park then closes for the week with them still on the lift, suspended high in the air during a storm.<br /><br />When I saw the previews for this movie earlier in the year I wanted to see it since I enjoyed Open Water and I saw this movie as one in similar plot to that.  I'm allergic to cold temperatures (no, I am not kidding, I am) so this is my own personal hell and would be a living nightmare for me.  Sadly unlike Open Water I didn't feel like I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie nor did I ever really believe they were in danger.<br /><br />My major gripe is that NONE of them ever look that terribly cold.  I don't know who the heck dropped this ball but it was the first of many.  If you are in fact SO cold that the idea of waiting until morning is so unbearable that you contemplate jumping to your possible death for the slim chance that you can find help then I would hope that you would zip up your coat the entire way and maybe even toss the hood over your head too for good measure.  It also appeared that not only was the outside jackets mostly unzipped but also the lining as well..?!!?  I get that would have been hard to film actors who had their faces covered but at least when they slept they could have burrowed in.  Call me crazy but I may even cuddle with those beside me - even if I didn't like them - for that whole body heat thing.  When sleeping you also tend to curl into a ball when you are cold to conserve body heat - especially curling your extremities in.  You don't naturally stretch out and make the vulnerable extremities more susceptible to the elements.  I think if they had done these things - even if it didn't change the rest of the movie - I think I would have been more involved in the story and would have had a higher opinion of it.<br /><br />The storyline itself is somewhat bumbling and awkward.  The nail biting scenes are all too quick and the web between is filled with awkward conversation that doesn't make much sense.  Granted, I can't imagine anyone in that situation would be a great conversationalist however it was severely lacking.<br /><br />There is quite a few \\"holy cow I can't look at this\\" scenes and for the gore fans that will be straight up your alley.  It's more cringe worthy than real gore but it will make you take a breath in and probably look away.  I wouldn't recommend this for the weak stomached.<br /><br />My final gripe is that the back cover pretty much gives away most of the movie - which is a complete buzzkill.  Why do all of this build up if the entire time you are waiting for the pictured scene on the back to happen - which is within about 5 minutes from the end of the film.<br /><br />It isn't the worst thriller I have ever seen but isn't the best by far.toryline itself is somewhat bumbling and awkward.

B003XWEQ1G|5.0|I thought this movie was a great prequel to the Robin Hood saga. Since there is no actual proof that Robin Hood was real, the story itself can have a bit of flexibility. And I thought this was a great interpretation of what drove Robin Hood into the robbing business. I would have liked to have seen more new scenes added in this director's cut, especially between Robin and Marian. But still, a great movie.  The scenery was beautiful and the life of the people seemed very realistic.    My only complaint is that on my blu-ray player, if I hit pause, when I come back I have to start the movie over (search for the scene). My son also bought it and he had a similar experience. The dvd played fine, so I guess I'll just watch that unless I can set a couple of hours aside with no interruptions. Ha! Did anyone else have this problem?

B002BWP4A6|4.0|Some people are drawn to negatives...they like examining the metaphoric train wrecks of life or dutifully exploring the empty space in the glass half-full.  And SOME people can't stand to be forced to join in on what they see as such a pointless journey.  Well, Michael Haneke, the writer/director of \\"Das Weisse Band\\" (\\"The White Ribbon\\" in English) seems hell-bent on taking his viewers on such a ride.  And he does so resolutely in this movie as well as several others like \\"Caché\\" (which was interesting) and \\"La Pianiste\\" (which was WAY bad in my book...as in \\"bad\\" bad, not \\"cool\\" bad).      And for understanding where this review is coming from , I'm kind of an in-the-middle type...I don't mind pondering minuses, but like to give the positives equal billing because they're both a part of life.  For me it's not hard to see the glass as half empty AND half full...and so it goes for me anyway.    The movie?  An old, small, isolated, pre-WWI German town structured around a wealthy land-owning Baron, experiences a few suspicious tragedies (deaths, torture, etc), and the story explores how some of the town explore, ignore and deal with the events.    If you're someone who likes their movies to provide nice, neatly packaged answers, this isn't the movie for you.   Life too often leaves us grasping for meaning and resolution (and frustrated by that lack of it), so most of us aren't crazy about watching a movie that just leaves us hanging.  Bad things happen in this movie (The White Ribbon), people interact, and we're left wondering the who's, what's, why's and how's of the events that unfolded.  There's very little bonding or empathy with any of the characters in this film.  There are frequently no heroes to root for (a VERY big problem I had watching the jealous, control-freak, semi-sadomasochistic piano teacher in \\"La Pianiste\\"), and understandably, the average watcher isn't going to get too emotionally invested in this film (and trust me, the average viewer is DYING toget emotionally invested in a film or they wouldn't make cheese-ball Harlequin fare like \\"Letters to Juliet\\" which I was forced to watch on a recent trans-Atlantic flight).  And many of the viewers who DO get emotionally invested in this movie will probably be upset by the lack of OBVIOUS return on the investment when it's over.    BUT, notice I said \\"OBVIOUS\\" return on investment.  This movie does strongly hint at a few possible answers.  We know who the perps likely were, we have probable reasons why they did it, and it's fairly well spelled-out that the behavior of the adults substantially affected the behavior of the children in the town.  So, there is SOME resolution, but it's not clearly and cleanly delivered in a satisfying way, and other aspects of the story are left conspicuously dangling, which is understandably frustrating to some.    I actually mostly liked this movie (to the tune of a \\"barely-4-star\\" rating) having experienced small-town German life.  Through some of the older neighbors we got to know, we developed a decent feel for the cliquishness and frequently small-minded mentality that can exist in a little village.  If my village was representative of average German small-town life, plenty of Germans from the WW2 generation still have a superiority complex that they're mostly not even aware of, and the church and obedience were (and still are quite often) central themes in their little village tribes.  We tend to look at the tribe-mentality in places like the Middle East and Africa as archaic, but it wasn't long ago that most of the western world was still living in isolated farming communities (often quite tribal in structure), with small-town quirks, and a church-dominated social structure.      Is it a perfect movie?  Nah...but it is well-made, has great acting and cinematography, and has something that might make you think.  For me, it WAS sort of like a Twilight Zone episode, but one that contained no chance of redemption or \\"lessons learned\\" for characters in the movie or the viewers watching it (as TZ episodes frequently did). It's just not an up-lifting, \\"feel good\\" movie, so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.

1883217040|5.0|This is the book I wish I had a long time ago. The author knows his stuff and dissects jazz in a meaningful way. Each theoretical idea is accompanied by a four bar example which will probably take you through the entire lexicon of jazz by the time you're finished. It is not bed time reading - by any means. You have to bring to the book what you already know and build on it.<br /><br />Another note: The book is spiral bound, so you can prop it up on your piano, or fold it back and it doesn't fold up and fall off. I know that's a little thing... but think of some of the other books you bought and you'll know what I mean.
0312600844|2.0|This book is absolutely obnoxious.  The writing is nothing stellar, and the tone of the book is completely trite, and socially ill-timed.  The Bush Era is over.

030726999X|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest provided a very satisfying ending to this trilogy. I would say this was my favorite of the three books, although The Girl Who Played with Fire is right up there with it. To me, they got better as they went along. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was great, but it was pretty complicated and filled with too much sexual violence for my liking. The Girl Who Played with Fire was much easier to follow along with, although I still felt lost at times, and it wasn't as disturbing in terms of violence.<br /><br />The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was the easiest for me to keep up with and, therefore, the easiest to read. I never once felt lost or confused, which was a nice change! This book is almost like a legal thriller in that most of the book is spent trying to find a way to clear Salander's name before she goes to trial. There's plenty of action and intrigue, though, as events unfold to finally reveal the truth of what's been going on in the background of all of the books.<br /><br />If you've read the first two books in this trilogy, I'm sure you'll be reading this one. If you only read the first book, but found it too violent, I'd recommend at least trying the next two. They do get easier and less disturbing as they go along! As for me, I absolutely loved The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest and am very sad to know that I won't be able to read anything else by Stieg Larsson in the future.

This album is more bubble gum, pop, and fast paced than any of the early stuff. Life Pursuit was a big demarcation of this bands work in my mind. With a few exceptions on Dear Cartography Waitress, Murdoch wrote primarily folk music in the early days. The lyrics used to be clear and understandable and the instrumentals were intricate and melodic. Isabel Campbell was a member of the band then too. After she left the band, the band started to change. Life Pursuit was much more up beat than anything previous. I thought it was a drastic change. Then came God Help the Girl, Stuart Murdoch's side project which featured many of the members from B&S on the instrumentals. Some people claim it was a return to more of an original B&S sound because it was a bit slower, but I disagree. If you really listen to that album, you will notice that Murdoch takes second stage behind the many female vocalists on the album. He is the harmonizer, not the lead singer. And the instrumentals are not as intricate. If you think back to many of the great songs that this band has created, Murdoch is the lead, and Stevie Jackson laid down beautiful harmonies over the top when the song would hit refrain or breakdown into what appear to me to be the sounds of my life. That sound, through the progression of Life Pursuit to God Help the Girl, has slowly been supplanted by female vocals that dominate faster paced songs. This trend bleeds forward into this album, \\"Write About Love.\\" And none of it sounds like old school Isabel Campbell, who used to be a welcomed intercession to the potent instrument and lyric of Stevie and Stuart.  The only thing from the early days that faintly reminds me of where the band is now is the song Lazy Line Painter Jane, but even then, there was this wicked organ playing in the background, creating a tune that was unlike anything I'd ever heard before. So, although there are a few songs from B&S's discography that share the qualities of the songs on this CD, when taken as a whole, it is a gross overstatement to claim that this music is a safe route, or more of the same, from B&S.     I respect that a band has to change. I also admire it. Although this music is not quite what I had in mind when I popped the disc in for the first time, it is, nonetheless, good music. It's just different. And although it doesn't appear that this album will be my favorite from 2010, I'm sure it will grow on me, much like their other, more recent stuff.     I will talk first about the second half of this album, because it is my favorite part of the CD. After the first listen, I find \\"The Ghost of Rockschool\\" and \\"Read the Blessed Pages\\" to be my favorites, probably because they sound most like early Murdoch (both in sound and lyric). These two songs are in a row (songs 8 and 9). Also, I think song 9 is about Isabel Campbell's departure from the band, which is very interesting to me. It's strange; it's almost as if Stewart keeps Isabel a part of the band by writing songs about her, even though she is forever gone. The proceeding 2, final songs on the album return to the style from the beginning, to sort of provide a full circle effect on this album. The first 5 songs sound like a mix of the songs from Life Pursuit and God Help the Girl, and the signature song, \\"Write About Love\\", is somewhere in the middle, which is actually perfect, because it is the song that links the first half of the CD to the second half. I have to think that the Band intended this effect, because they clearly establish the two sides of this record, even on the CD version, by a line that demarcates each from the other. The 7th song, \\"I'm Not Living in the Real World\\" is freaking awesome!!! It's a fast paced whirlwind of amazing sounds from a huge range of instruments. It just makes me want to get up and sing and dance! Although it isclearly a Belle and Sebastian type song, it's new in its own right. I think Stevie must have written this one for sure.     Overall I give this 4 stars. This is the first time I've ever rated anything by B&S under 5 stars. Hopefully, after a few listens, I will find myself thinking of this album as more of a masterpiece. But for now, it's just really good music.    Also, I look forward to the many singles and EP's that will surely and inevitably follow the release of this full length B&S album (bring on the B-sides!!). Thanks for reading.
B000024KBF|5.0|The late Pink Floyd co-founder/original guitarist/singer/songwriter Syd Barrett's rarities album entitled Opel was released in October of 1988 (it was released in the US in early 1989).<br />The Opel album consisted of songs that were not used on Syd's two officially released solo albums from 1970 The Madcap Laughs and Barrett respectively. Many people (back in 1988 and even today) scoff at this compilation. However, Opel was the first Syd Barrett album I ever got on CD in May of 1994 after hearing a dub of this album on cassette tape in late 1993.<br />The title track is one of the highlights on this album and was one of the first things recorded for The Madcap Laughs but left off the original album and the title cut is one of my favorite Syd songs ever. Other songs on this rarities collection that were not ever issued previously on the two Syd Barrett solo albums were \\"Dolly Rocker\\", \\"Birdie Hop\\", \\"Let's Split\\", \\"Swan Lee\\" (an excellent song about Indians (Native American tribes)), \\"Lanky (pt.1)\\" and \\"Milky Way\\".<br />Some of the earlier takes of \\"Octopus\\" (here as its original title \\"Clowns and Jugglers\\" recorded with The Soft Machine members in 1968), \\"Golden Hair\\" (in both an early take and the closing instrumental recorded in early 1969) and \\"Wouldn't You Miss Me\\" (better known as \\"Dark Globe\\") are way better on Opel than the finished versions on The Madcap Laughs album by a longshot in my view.<br />On the European issue of Opel, which was originally part of the Crazy Diamond 3-CD boxed set released in Europe in 1993, there are more alternate takes of songs. First is \\"Gigolo Aunt\\" (with full band of Syd on guitar and vocals, Syd's successor (and close friend) David Gilmour on bass guitar, fellow Pink Floyd bandmate (the late) Rick Wright on organ and Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley on drums), two versions of \\"It is Obvious\\" (one take with Syd singing in a low octave on electric guitar then an acoustic guitar sounding version with Syd singing in a seemingly falsetto voice), \\"Late Night\\" (without the vocals nor the overdubs) and a great early take of \\"Effervescing Elephant\\".<br />The European edition of Opel which was re-released in 1993 was superior to the US version originally released in 1988.

She was graduating from High School that year and had done a delayed enlistment in the Army.

B001R4METS|5.0|Genesis' third album Nursery Cryme was released in November of 1971.<br />By this point, lead singer Peter Gabriel, keyboard player Tony Banks and bass player Mike Rutherford were going through the motions as they lost original guitarist Anthony Phillips and went through drummers as drummer John Mayhew also quit.<br />The three surviving members of Genesis held auditions for a new drummer and guitarist and settled on then 20 year olds Phil Collins and Steve Hackett (who joined a few months after collins joined). The former also brought some needed humor and a singing voice to off-set Gabriel's theatrics and the latter a superb guitar style.<br />With a lineup they could be happy with, Genesis went to Trident Studios in London to work on Nursery Cryme, how would the album be, read on.<br />We begin with the ten minute epic \\"The Musical Box\\" which is the reason for buying this album. The beginning is wonderful enough. The overdubbing of 12-strings from Hackett, Banks and Rutherford is quasi-Victorian in its feel with some haunting electric guitar fills from Hackett and joined by Gabriel and Collins' voices and Gabriel's flute. Then it suddenly shifts to an explosive hard rock tune, dominated by the killer soloing of Hackett's guitar and the killer percussion of Collins. Every time I hear this song, I still get a shiver down the spine. The last two minutes of the song are like a religious experience. The virtuoso feel of Banks' organ, cymbal-heavy drumming from Collins, Rutherford's 12-string playing, Gabriel's repeated shouting of the word \\"now!\\" and the way Hackett's guitar suddenly bursts from the back to the foreground make for a glorious climax which you don't hear anymore. Next we have \\"For Absent Friends\\" which marked the vocal debut of Phil Collins whom would become a key member to this exciting band over the next 25 years. We then end the first half with another epic \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" which tells a haunting but light-hearted tale which is a great song and has an awesome intro with Hackett's guitar and Banks' organ playing a haunting riff.<br />The next song is \\"The Seven Stones\\" which kicks off the second half and is a good tune but not as superb as the first two epics on the album. Next is the comedic \\"Harold the Barrel\\" which shows the band were starting to become more light-hearted thanks to Collins' presence. \\"Harlequin\\" is next and is the calm before the album's final storm. The final storm is the nearly 8 minute epic entitled \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" which is a great way to end the album. It starts with Banks' organ and mellotron haunting playing then joined by that awesome bass riff from Rutherford and vocals from Gabriel and guitar from Hackett and drums from Collins. It starts at medium pace then we go fast for the middle section then goes back to the medium pace of most of song then ends slow and majestic. The highlight is the instrumental that occurs about three and a half minutes in. And the way it ends contains some of the most balanced musicianship on the album.<br />The album may not have sold but who cares about sales, Nursery Cryme is still a classic today despite being recorded in 1971.<br />In November of 2008, Rhino/Atlantic re-released the album as a CD/DVD set. The album was painstakingly remixed by engineer Nick Davis in stereo for excellent sound (in a similar manner to what was done to The Who catalog in the 1990s). The new mixes are AMAZING and I hear things in the new mixes that I have not ever heard before. The DVD was in 5.1 and had an excellent slide show with the album and interviews with band members. In March, 2009, Virgin/EMI re-released the 2008 mix of the album as a single CD set.<br />This new mix of Nursery Cryme is recommended!an awesome intro with Hackett's guitar and Banks' organ playing a haunting riff.

1439133948|4.0|I've read all the Miles Vorkosigan series, and eagerly devoured this one within two hours of receipt. That two hours is no exaggeration- this book is 352 pages of widely spaced, largish fonted type. Multiple plot points that could have been expanded weren't, and there was one bona-fide misuse of Chekhov's Gun.    I'm giving this book 4 stars because the writing is good and the plot enjoyable, but I admit that I was very tempted to give it a three. I'll be disappointed if this book isn't just filler to hold off fans while Bujold crafts something with a bit more heft.

B000002IR7|4.0|One thing you can count on with musicians such as Booker T Jones,Steve Cropper,Al Jackson and Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn is that all of them are extremely talented people. Their ability to maintain their trademark instrumental precision with extremely soulful licks and exchanges is now well renowned. Many bands have since attempted,to varrying levels of success to approximate this approch and in the 60's the sound served this band so well that they became the main Stax house band during that era while making remarkable singles under their own name. Of course the title track and it's shadow \\"Mo Onions\\" are by all accounts the strongest general tunes on this album;songs that people who may not even know the name of the band will recognize and that encompassess the very best in their precision based instrumental bluesy soul music. One thing that's important to mention is this album was recorded in 1962 and at that time (with the possible exception of Ray Charles) even artists such as James Brown were not so much thinking in terms of album oriented music as much utilizing the long playing medium to collect together singles into collections that sounded cohesive even if they really weren't. And so as the case with this album. Considering that Stax hadn't been around too many years before this was released there's some similarities to an earlier Stax band known as The Mar Keys so on likeminded tunes such as \\"Rinky-Dink\\" which as that band had done used the idea of precision and melody together. It's a bit stiff than the usually fairly loose approch the MG's had,and I need to add there is a difference between precision and loosness. A similar situation occurs on other interpretations of songs such as \\"Twist And Shout\\" and \\"Lonely Avenue\\" although the secular gospel wail of \\"I Got A Woman\\" comes across a lot better as they let loose a lot more rhythmically. \\"Behave Yourself\\" and \\"Stranger On The Shore\\" do a bit better overall due to the fact they showcase a slower,more forboding blusiness that allows the soul of their musicianship to shine through to a greater degree. Even though this isn't their first album it probably isn't the place to begin appreciating the MG's music. For most other reviewers are right:the band packed it's trademark punch more on singles so a well assembled compilation such as the recent [[ASIN:B000FZESQM Booker T. & The MG'S :The Definitive Soul Collection]] but for those who have such a collection and want to investigate the spirit of their music in it's original context this isn't a bad place to go actually.lower,more forboding blusiness that allows the soul of their musicianship to shine through to a greater degree.

I also like the fact that I can return to my favorite musical numbers whenever I want.  I would recommend this DVD set to anyone that enjoys the program.
1591843162|5.0|Seth is indeed an artist.  His book is not perfect, but it has made a change in how I see myself and the world.  To that I give him thanks.  His book needs to read (or listened to - I had the audio version which was well done) several times to gain the most from it.  The sections on the \\"Resistance\\" and \\"Shipping\\" were especially insightful.  Warning this book can be somewhat depressing as some of the truths it reveals are not that positive.  However, on balance I feel it along with other recent reads such as \\"Talent is Overrated\\", \\"Talent Code\\", \\"A Complaint Free World\\" have open my mind for the better.  I Look forward to reading more of the author.
0765322889|5.0|I read Gardens of the Moon a few months ago and I instantly moved on to Deadhouse Gates, the second book in the series, and am 2/3rd's through Memories of Ice. This review is more general to the series than specific to Gardens of the Moon. Gardens itself is probably a 3 or 4 out of 5, his books after that (limited to those I've read obviously) and much better, definitely deserving of a 4 - 5 rating. But these books together provide a story that is greater than their parts. The characters are unique and believable with few, if any, \\"standard grunts\\".    But like my title says, these books, especially Gardens, require much more effort from the reader than most are accustomed to. Read any of the negative reviews here and you may get a sense of what I'm talking about. New characters appear without any introduction. But this isn't limited to just characters; powers, \\"warrens\\", places, events, whole histories and empires are introduced without sometimes more than a passing reference. People, places, and things are talked about as though the reader already knows their history. Because of this it's very easy to become lost and confused about what's going on, and characters motives to what's happening. This, I believe, is the single greatest complaint about the books. But there's the rub...    This is also it's greatest strength. Reading the books you have to keep your wits about you. There's no leash to keep you with the story, you have to stay alert to follow along. This can be difficult at times as you'll be confused as to what's happening, and why. But here's the good part, if you can stay along for the journey, you'll be far more satisfied with the outcome, and looking forward to the next chapter with greater anticipation than you would have otherwise. Stay with it long enough, and you'll also be rewarded with answers to questions that you had two books ago.    Gardens isn't a book you can read a couple hundred pages and get a lot out of it. You're also going to have tobe willing to be kept in the dark about many things. It's like being in a massive dark chamber unable to see anything beyond that of a single torch on the wall. Every now and then though a new torch is lit, illuminating more of the room. Over time you begin to realize you're in a magnificent room with grand statues and wonderful art adorning every inch. It's a sight to behold, and so, even though you can leave at any time, you remain, greatly anticipating the lighting of the next torch.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|well im an avid reader in 6th grade (12 1/2) and I did get into it but... it wasn't interesting... I would reccomend warriors by erin hunter
1401324029|4.0|The book is strong in humorous character interplay but is lacking in transitions. In one paragraph, the character is entering a building. In the next, Det. Heat is up the elevator and looking over a crime scene. Its hard to catch a transition sometimes, so the read is not always smooth, probably because its written by TV writers. There are also alot of abbreviations for things that do not always get explained.<br /><br />That being said, the book has great humor which prevails throughout. This helps to highlight the depth and relationships of the characters. The plotline keeps you turning the pages. There are so many twists and unexpected turns just like a Castle episode. I enjoyed the \\"who dunnit\\" mystery. The pace was great. Plus, just when you think you have it figured out, one line comes in at the end of a chapter that makes your heart skip a beat and realize the adventure is not over yet! I was disappointed in the last paragraph of the book. It kind of fizzled out to a blip instead of the sharp hummor of the rest of the story.<br /><br />You have to love the one liners between \\"Roach\\" and the banter between Heat and Rook. Of course, you can picture the well-acted TV alter egos throughout! You can feel Castle narrating the pages especially his fantasy romance scenes and tension between \\"Heat,\\" for which the tension is also building up in the show! The end acknowledgements are fun too. Plus, I just watched the Castle episode where he was doing duct tape researchfor \\"Naked Heat.\\" What fun crossovers!

B002ZG99G8|4.0|\\"The Losers\\" is a perfect example of a studio mishandling the marketing of a good movie.  I have a vague recollection of it coming out in the spring prior to the impending heavily promoted summer blockbusters.  I told a good friend of mine about it who is a big action afficienado and he had no recall of it at all.  I didn't go into it with high expectations thinking it would be nothing more than a series of CGI and explosions that passes itself off as action.  To my surprise \\"The Losers\\" had a gripping story at it's core directed at a breakneck pace to keep your attention throughout.  The characters were full-bodied and not caricatures despite the film's comic book origins.  The ending portends to a possible sequel but word has to get out about this genuine sleeper in order for that to happen.

B003ZJJHWK|2.0|I was first introduced to Antony and the Johnsons when I came across his cover of \\"if it be your will\\" and I was instantly hooked. Since then I wore out his previous cd's. His self titled and also the crying light have not left my playstack. His unique voice and artfull creativeness is sheer brilliance. That being said, with the Swanlights cd I found myself in that same dark, desolate, and depressing place except this time I was wanting to escape it. By track 5 I had my psychiatrist on speed dial. I found myself asking, when is art too much art?? This cd was a rather difficult one to enjoy. Only the artist himself knows at times what he is talking about. This artist confronts the issues of ghosts, death, and dying. But hasn't he already done that? This cd just had too many layers of instruments, wailing, and confusion to really enjoy it. Fletta (the bjork duet)is one of the highlights on this cd along with \\"thank you for your love\\" is a close second. For me though, I recommend the EP \\"thank you for your love\\". The selections on it are more sane and more enjoyable. You can understand it more and it has less mess going on in the background.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I've read all Dan Brown's novels and was very excited to sit down with his latest work, but when all was said and done I felt ripped off.  This was a weak last gasp from an author who apparently has run out of juice.      The novel contains much talk of wondrous secrets; secrets so powerful that, if revealed, would change the course of humankind. Brilliant, powerful men go to great lengths to keep the information secreted away while the bad guy kills, maims and tortures anyone in his way to get it.  The evil bad guy starts out evil and scary but suddenly turns confused and clueless.  He goes from absolutely knowing when someone is gaming him to a willingness to believe whatever he is told.  Weak.  But that was not the worst part.       After all the clues are pieced together, we learn that there is a bible buried in one of the corner stones of the Washington Monument.  Whoa!      And that's not all!  Get ready for the really amazing part, the part that must be kept secret at all costs lest mankind be doomed:  If you go to the very top of the Washington Monument and look out the windows you will find that the monument was placed at a very precise angle.  It is angled so that if you look out one window you will be looking directly at the Capitol Bldg.  If you look out another window you will be looking directly at the Lincoln Memorial! Another window- you will be looking directly at some other monument or official building. Wow!  Can't you see how that kind of secret information was important enough for people to die for?    Maybe other people saw something I missed but I felt violated.  If I was writing a book and could not produce a better payoff than that I would not publish it.  I don't know if Dan Brown is retiring from writing but for me he is.

B003TML0VO|5.0|Guitar Heaven is the appropriately named latest project from Carlos Santana.  I say \\"appropriately named\\" because the song selections and Santana's treatment and interpretation of those songs are absolutely heavenly.  I picked up the disc while vacationing in Phoenix and couldn't turn the darn thing off.  I LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />From the opening riffs of Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love, with a more than phenomenal vocal delivery by Chris Cornell (Soundgarden and Audioslave) to the duet with Jonny Lang on I Ain't Superstitious, this CD delivers a delightful bundle of great songs that you'll more than likely hit repeat repeatedly.  Also enjoying the rare and special opportunity to work with this guitar legend are such incredible artists as Scott Weiland, Rob Thomas, Chris Daughtry, Nas, India.Arie, Yo-Yo Ma, Jacoby Shaddix, Pat Monahan, Gavin Rossdale and Joe Cocker.<br /><br />One very interesting and pleasant surprise on the album is Santana's version of the Doors hit, Rider's On The Storm, featuring Chester Bennington (Linkin Park) and Doors co-founder and keyboardist, Ray Manzarek.  Delivered with a similar, but completely different, eeriness, the unmistakable ivory artistry of Mansarek provides a consistent thread from the original recording to Santana's interpretation of this iconic hit.  I'm not sure but I think Jim Morrison would be proud of this one.<br /><br />If you love the original versions of the twelve songs on Guitar Heaven, then you're going to also love Santana's version of these same tunes.

0061251305|1.0|I found this book to be an absolute disaster. If so many American capitalists consider this a 5-star, classic business book, then there is no doubt in my mind that American capitalism is in serious trouble.<br /><br />\\"Tribes\\" have been a trendy, hip meme in the past couple years - witness the popularity of [[ASIN:1591842336 Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us]] by Seth Godin.<br /><br />Now our effervescent corporate cheerleaders at Culturesync define tribes as \\"a group between 20 and 150 people\\" (p.4) which is not only so unbelievably broad as to be useless but is a definition that ignores all the fascinating history, sociology and anthropology that exists around the concept of this particular social structure. Anything in this book about the etymology of the word going back to the three ethnic divisions of ancient Roman state? Nope. Anthing about cultural or social rituals that promote group cohesion such as initiation ceremonies? Nada. Anything about anthropological classifications of tribal structures, from egalitarian to stratified/authoritarian? Negatory.<br /><br />Authors Logan, King and Fischer-Wright have eagerly seized upon anthropologist Robin Dunbar's \\"150 is the limit of a cohesive group\\" number because it's mentioned in another pop business book, Malcom Gladwell's [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]]. But a couple of issues:<br /><br />1) Dunbar's work is based on primates, not people<br /><br />2) There are competing theories and numbers, such as the Bernard-Kilworth median of 231 people.<br /><br />3) The idea that \\"Hey, people like to efficiently organize themselves into groups of 100-200 people,\\" isn't new, but actually quite ancient, given the fact that, for example, Roman legions were doing it over 2,000 years ago.<br /><br />If I was concerned about p.4's definition of \\"tribe,\\" but p.5's mention of George Washington as a \\"Tribal Leader\\" set my alarm bells off. Messers Logan, King and Fischer-Wright clearly are so clueless, so complete wrong about the biography of the first President of the United States that they have absolutely no idea of what their talking about.<br /><br />George Washington was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, 1787 Constitutional Convention delegate and first American President - all roles vastly more powerful, and intellectually sophisticated than \\"Tribal Leader.\\" Calling someone a \\"Tribal Leader\\" would have sounded as nothing less than a vile insult any late 18th Century Christian American upper-class gentleman's ears. Distilling Washington's role at the Constitutional Convention as \\"get the members to talk about what united them\\" sounds nothing but ironic since Washington said next to nothing during the deliberations, and most of the talk at the Convention was about the issues that disunited them - like slavery.<br /><br />Logan, King and Fischer-Wright may revel in metaphorical tribes, but Washington had to deal with real Native American ones:<br />- During the Seven Year's War<br />- Directing General Sullivan's 1779 scorched earth campaign against the pro-British Iroquois in the Revolutionary War and<br />- His efforts as President to \\"civilize\\" & Christianize the Indians while overseeing the expansion of white settlers.<br /><br />George Washington was intimately familiar with the methods and qualities of tribal leadership, but I don't think the Iroquois chief \\"Half King\\" Tanaghrisson's 1754's hatchet antics against French diplomat Jumonville are going to make it into a CultureCync sequel.<br /><br />From page 5 on the book rapidly devolves into businesss-peak gobbledegook about \\"Stages,\\" \\"Values\\" and \\"Leadership,\\" reflecting the the New Thought/New Age trans-personal feel-good pablum which are this book's origins.<br /><br />Did you know that there's absolute no mention in this book of how \\"tribal leadership\\" is supposed to increase sales, promote efficiencies save time or any other traditional capitalistic yardstick to measure performance improvement? That there are at least 14 citations in the Index for \\"Relationships\\" but nothing for \\"Responsibility?\\"<br /><br />Reading this book was more tribulation than tribal.

B003DZX44I|5.0|This movie is fantastic and even better is the way that Disney has restored this classic in high def. The colors and detail are perfect, I honestly don't think anything else they could have done with it. This is one of the best Disneys of all time and it's definitely worth having it on blu ray. I love how Disney does things right. Well done! A must own!
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|The Predators franchise is not for people looking for intellectual stimulation.  Like the rest of the series and many movies within its genre, the latest Predator installment is a ride in the world of the human hunted -- with a serious twist at the end.    Since starring in \\"King Kong,\\" Adrien Brody has redefined his role as a leading actor and his portrayal in this film is not necessarily Oscar-worthy but sure as heck entertaining.      This is nothing short of suspenseful and action-packed.  If you're familiar with the Predators series but was never really a fan, you're probably not going to like this film.  But, if you're just looking for a sci-fi, action film and not much more, this is a great choice for a Friday night in.
0061906220|5.0|It's clear that the reviewer from School Library Journal never read this book aloud to kids.<br /><br />Because if she had, she'd quickly have realized that kids LOVE the story structure, the silliness of stepping in big piles of colored fruit, and of singing the song. The book includes a free download from the Harper site.<br /><br />I also strongly disagree with the assertion that this book doesn't empower kids. There is nothing that empowers kids more than a silly book that pokes fun at the things you're not supposed to do, like get your shoes dirty.<br /><br />It won't take more than 1 or 2 readings before kids will be reciting this story by heart. If you don't believe me, check out the adorable recitations of YouTube, like this one: [...]<br /><br />This book is a true home-grown phenomenon, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a fun, positive book with great read-aloud chops. It's wonderful.
B000002549|4.0|What a nice surprise this was. I found \\"Classical Barbra\\" in a thrift shop, and never having heard it before, decided to take a chance on it.  What a nice way to start a beautiful Saturday morning, listening to this recording.  Since classical music is not my forte, it will take me several listenings to reach the level of \\"I love it,\\" but the potential for that is definitely there.  Barbra's voice soothes the spirit, and the exquisite musicianship of the Columbia Symphony Orchestra (cond. Claus Ogerman) creates a beautiful synthesis with her remarkable vocal instrument.    And at the risk of having some fatuous expert expel their knowledge and so-called superior tastes in my direction, let me whole-heartedly recommend \\"Classical Barbra\\" as a way to recover from the grind of the work week, and the wear and tear of living in our conflict-ridden world.

B000002U9W|4.0|\\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is an album that many Pink Floyd fans seem to hold different views about; and it starts to mark the transition from the early Floyd as an underground phenomenon to the later Floyd as a concert-hall sensation.    One problem in appreciating the album is that many people who come to it for the first time are already fans of the \\"classic\\" albums in which the Floyd is supposed to have more truly hit its stride: \\"Meddle,\\" \\"The Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Animals,\\" and \\"The Wall.\\" Familiar with these later, more formulaic works, these folks find \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" (and most of the Floyd's earlier work as well) a bizarre departure from the so-called norm.    Another problem in appreciating \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" as an album comes from the other side of the Pink Floyd camp: those who think that the Pink Floyd's founder, Syd Barrett, was an absolute genius, and that everything that the Pink Floyd did without Syd pales in comparison.    For the former folks, I would suggest putting away the \\"classic\\" albums mentioned above for a spell and trying to imagine another Floyd, one that was operating at a smaller scale, born out of the mid-sixties UK underground art and psychedelic scenes. Rather, concentrate on the Floyd's albums (and singles!) that pre-date \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and listen to other UK bands of the 1966-70 era, particularly the first three albums by the Soft Machine (arguably the Pink Floyd's main rival at the time), the sole album released by Tomorrow, and the various artists featured on the Harvest record-label anthology, \\"Picnic: A Breath of Fresh Air,\\" so as to become familiar with the context in which the early Floyd was operating at the time.    For the latter folks, perhaps it might be useful to recall that without the subsequent success of the arena-rock Floyd, Syd Barrett's name would probably have been consigned to relative obscurity, rather than the cult-like status he has more recently achieved. Yes, he burned brightly, but briefly; and had it not been for the studio assistance of Roger Waters, Richard Wright, and David Gilmour, his two solo albums, \\"The Madcap Laughs\\" and \\"Barrett,\\" almost certainly would not have been completed, let alone released. Thus, both Syd and the Pink Floyd could arguably be said to have collaborated until 1970, which, coincidentally, was the year of the release of \\"Atom Heart Mother.\\"    As for my impressions of the \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" album itself, I have not much to add to the many reviews given below--perhaps Jennifer's recent assessment comes close to describing, on a song by song basis, why I enjoy this album on its own terms, or in the way I do. Much like the soundtrack to the film, \\"More,\\" it is an overlooked gem in the Pink Floyd canon; and it certainly succeeds in the sense that it is an \\"experimental\\" pop album. And while the musical range contained therein is fairly far-flung (rock to modern classical), there is a delightfully consistent feel throughout the record. Some reviewers have also suggested that the Floyd originally wanted \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" to serve as some sort of soundtrack for a film about the American West. My sense is that here they may be confusing \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" with the Pink Floyd's prior work on the soundtrack to Michelangelo Antonioni's fine and underrated film, \\"Zabriskie Point,\\" which does indeed involve aspects of the western American landscape.    Finally, it is necessary to mention the contribution of Ron Geesin, who also worked with Roger Waters on \\"Ummagumma\\" and \\"Music from 'The Body.'\\" Geesin scored the orchestral aspects of the \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" suite and possibly arranged the brass section of \\"Summer '68\\" and the musique concrete aspects of \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast.\\" The \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" suite is an interesting early example of a pop group combining with classical orchestration, with Ron Geesin's role here suggesting parallels to David Bedford's work with both Kevin Ayers and the Whole World andMike Oldfield's \\"Hergest Ridge.\\" Geesin also produced and arranged Bridget St. John's \\"Songs for the Gentle Man,\\" another overlooked gem.

You really get a sense of who Bruce Lee was as a person from reading his thoughts on the subject of life in general, which I found inspiring.  As far as the quality of this hard cover version of the book, it is decent, but not perfect in that it is basically a paperback book glued to a hardcover, rather than a real hard cover book that is interwoven into the hard cover, as real hard cover library books are.  I still would have have bought this book for the price having known this prior however.

B003RV43X4|3.0|Why do film school geeks constantly try to make every film live up to their unrealistic expectations? Anyone with half a brain should know based on watching the previews that Clash of the Titans was going to be a CGI soup with not much else. If you're willing to except that, then you will enjoy this movie.     If you're hoping for Goodwill Hunting meets 300 then you better grow up and realize that some films are made for pure entertainment and action. This is one of them, and I'm fine with that. Keep your expectations low, enjoy the CGI and action, and you'll enjoy the film.     If you're too pretentious to do that, they you should pass.

0316017922|4.0|First of all, I enjoyed this book a lot. It was a stimulating read and I finished in a few hours. It was hard to put down, and I came away with some interesting new observations that, like one reviewer here said, will make for useful cocktail party conversation. The book has my recommendation.    However, I do have a few quibbles with Gladwell's brief analysis here of the Beatles, whom he says owe their success primarily to the hours they played in Hamburg, Germany, years before they became world famous. I'm an amateur Beatles scholar who has been studying the group in great detail for more than 30 years, and I don't think Gladwell gave them enough credit.    Gladwell doesn't take into account the fact that the Beatles were not the only British rock group to spend thousands of hours toiling away in Hamburg. There were many others. Yet we never hear today of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, for instance, just one of the British groups who also spent time playing to the Hamburg audiences. Gladwell ignores this inconvenient fact. Indeed, if you read the book and knew nothing else about the Beatles, you'd come away thinking that any British band that put in its requisite \\"10,000 hours\\" playing in Hamburg would have had as much success as the Beatles. This simply isn't the case.     The Beatles were very hard workers; there's no doubt. And by 1962, after all that time in Hamburg (and playing nearly every day and night in Liverpool when they weren't in Germany), they were a tight little band that was at the very top of the Liverpool rock scene. But that in and of itself didn't point to the world fame they would achieve two years later.    What got the Beatles to where they ended up - the most celebrated, successful band in the history of popular music and one whose compositions have been compared to those of the greatest classical composers - was first and foremost the combination in one place of two musicians of immense creative talent: John Lennon and Paul McCartney. It'sbeen written many times and in many places what each of these individuals brought to the band, so I won't repeat it here. I will say that no other rock band in history could claim two members with such talents combined. That is the number one reason for the Beatles' success. And it also explains why contemporaries Rory Storm and the Hurricanes or Gerry and the Pacemakers, though relatively successful in Liverpool through their hard work playing in Hamburg and in England, never achieved the heights climbed by the Beatles.    Another factor in the Beatles' great success, and one that Gladwell actually talks about in another chapter unrelated to the Beatles, is personality. Few, if any, rock groups have had the charm of the Beatles. That charm led directly to Brian Epstein wanting to  manage them, and also to George Martin agreeing to sign them to a recording contract. The story has been told many times of how in their first recording test for Martin, in 1962, the Beatles failed to impress him with their musical abilities or their song writing. In fact, Martin later said he thought the original songs they played him that day, including \\"Love Me Do,\\" were lousy. But it was when he talked to the group after the recording test that he realized he had to sign them. Lennon, McCartney and George Harrison (Ringo Starr was not yet a member), left Martin and his assistant in stitches with their humor, and that, rather than their music, is why they got a chance to record. For a better understanding of the Beatles' incredible personal charm, I recommend their first movie, \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" which is recognized by every serious movie expert as a landmark comedy.    Yes, the Beatles put in their \\"10,000 hours.\\" They were incredibly hard workers who, when they recorded their first album in a single day, shocked the recording studio staff when they declined to take a lunch break because they wanted to continue rehearsing. They made their famous recording of \\"Twist and Shout\\" at 10:30 p.m. after spending 12 hours in the studio working on that first album, their voices hoarse with effort. But their talent and charm were two other key factors in their extraordinary success, and Gladwell doesn't spend time discussing this. I just wanted to set the record straight.

1416972250|4.0|Before reading this review, please note that because this is a review of the third book, there will be spoilers. Major spoilers that will hinder your enjoyment of the first two books. Only read this review if you have read the first two books.<br /><br />PJVs QUICKIE POV: The final installment of The Mortal Instruments series was nothing to sneeze at. Where I had been basically bored with the second book, the third also had me yawning at the beginning, but once I got about 100 pages in...it was rocking and rolling. The tragedy of this whole series I think is that the whole time while reading this series I was waiting for just one thing to happen - and anything in between was just fodder. Hence, the reason why I was completely impatient with the second book.<br /><br />REVIEW: The conclusion of the Mortal Instruments series ends with a bang. On a mission to find a mage that holds the key to her mother's coma. Clary must travel to the City of Glass, the home of the Shadowhunters. Problem is Jace is dead set on not letting Clary come to the city. Stubborn and hard-headed Clary won't let Jace stop her from saving her mother, or the council, or lakes that just a drop of their water will cause madness and death...<br /><br />While Clary is sneaking into the City of Glass, Jace is making new friends, Simon is inadvertently being imprisoned...Valentine is still plotting and systematically enacting the extermination of his own people. Through all this Clary has one goal to save her mother and Jace one goal - patricide.<br /><br />The book I have to say was a wonderful conclusion of the series. Questions were answered, problems resolved, etc. It was interesting seeing more of the Shadowhunter world, even though I think the background description should have been expanded much more - it was very 2D compared to Clare's description of New York and the Institute. Bothersome attributes of the book included the back and forth of unknown emotions between Jace and Clary, I really understand they are conflicted, but cut the lying out and the whining. They both were rather whiny in the book and they did some stupid things in between the lying and whining. Great things about the book, the political intrigue was good, the fast paced action series and the finale was excellent.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATIONS: Of course if you read and enjoyed the first two books I don't think I need to tell you to read this one. There is violence and a few sketchy topics but nothing I wouldn't pass on to a teen.cut the lying out and the whining.

B003UYUQZW|5.0|This movie has nearly all the makings of an Epic motion picture. It has an exotic setting, a new crisp plot, plenty of action, and a beautiful woman. Our hero starts out as a street orphan who champions goodness against the Persian army as he jumps around rooftops like the Phantom. However, once he becomes adopted by the king, he loses a lot of personality. He is not as colorful as other leading men in Epic films, mostly due to the writers who gave him lousy lines.<br /><br />What was really missing in this movie outside of exceptional dialogue was humor. I don't mean turn the movie into a comedy, but when you want to be compared to Pirates..., Indian Jones, or other epics such as Star Wars or even the grand daddy of them all LOTR, they all had some comical element in them with leading men that were able to deliver those lines. This movie lacked that human element and it showed as it failed to hook me.<br /><br />In spite of the inability of either the script writers or director to create great characters, the plot, action and scenery were enough to carry the film to where it would be enjoyable. There was one \\"joke\\" as the princess kept an amulet with the sands of time in it on a necklace located at her cleavage...the last place anyone would look, except maybe Prince Dustin who noticed it right off.<br /><br />Yes, there is a time travel element to it, but it is not really a time travel movie, i.e. it is not bogged down with nerdy time travel paradoxes. Time travel was a gift from the unnamed god(s).<br /><br />The movie has a happy ending with a message of hope as well as violence, killing, and snakes. I consider it better entertainment than Robin Hood, or Iron Man II.<br />4 1/2 stars.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Did you ever dream being able to run inconsiderate drivers who are too lazy to signal their turns or lane changes off the road and onto the sidewalk? How about spiral-diving amongst a swarm of black-clad enemies and picking them out one by one? How about doing the same while skydiving? Or shooting bullets from your bare hand?<br /><br />This is an action movie that manages to both make fun of the action genre hyperboles and, at the same time, deliver a string of explosive action sequences. Sure, the plot is not the most deep but it far from paper-thin and, anyway, these are 86min of your life you will be glad you spent having fun.<br /><br />The Academy gave ...THE HURT LOCKER an Oscar and they passed over this movie!!? SHOOT 'EM UP deserves an Oscar for just two unforgettable scenes: the packaging-line shootout in Mr Smith's lair and the unique shootout/sex ballet. Now, throw in Paul Giammati's smart-ass one-liners and you have yourself a movie which is great fun to watch.<br /><br />Giammati may try his hardest to be the usual scene-stealer yet Clive Owen is the one who really delivers this movie. I am sure when they watched this, the producers of the James Bond franchise were kicking themselves for going with...Daniel Craig.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B00158K0S8|5.0|Other reviewers have described, better than I can, why this is a great film. So I won't try.    I do want to comment on one aspect of it. Though obviously a fairly big-budget film, it's equally obvious that no budget would have been able to do full justice to the scope of the events the movie depicts. You can't have tens of thousands of extras, and thousands of vintage WWII aircraft and vehicles. But the makers of this movie did an excellent job in using the resources they did have to suggest far bigger numbers. You repeatedly see Patton in his jeep or car, leading columns of trucks or tanks, with foot soldiers slogging along beside. And it gives an adequate illusion of much greater numbers.    One way in which they fell a bit short in this area, though, was in the use of aircraft. If you watch this movie, you might get the idea that the entire Luftwaffe consisted of just two twin-engine planes, which followed Patton from North Africa to Sicily to the European continent. I kept thinking \\"Can't anybody shoot down those two blasted planes before they do more damage? And how is that they're always harassing Patton, no matter where he is?\\"

0545123275|4.0|Shiver is told from the alternating perspectives of Grace, a girl who is fascinated with the wolves---and one wolf in general---in her backyard, and Sam, who just so happens to be that one wolf. Stiefvater wrote so fluidly and poetically that the distinction between the characters' voices was definitely there, but it wasn't so jarringly different that it yanked you out of the story.<br /><br />I really liked the idea of the werewolves changing shape with the cold weather. It's not anything I've seen so far, and I five Stiefvater major props for uniqueness. Also I think the cover is stunning, don't you? Gives an air of... ice, and coldness. And danger, with all the thorns.<br /><br />I thought Sam and Grace's relationship was adorable---with scenes like \\"Surprise attack\\" and then he would suddenly kiss her. Come on now, let's all say it together, \\"Awww\\"---but I found it very underdeveloped when they first began, erm, dating. If that's even what you can call Grace letting a boy she's never met (aside from staring at him across the lawn while he's in wolf form) sleep in her room, in her bed, with her still in the bed. As a reader, we are expected to believe that because Sam and Grace \\"knew\\" each other while he was in wolf form for years and made a connection, that they are automatically going to fall in the love the moment they meet in person. But, that aside, they were a great couple as the story progressed. They complimented each other perfectly. Grace was independent and brave, while Sam was sensitive and strong.<br /><br />But, I did have a few issues with the book. Firstly, Grace's parents. They were just downright neglectful and apathetic to Grace. I mean, come on, her dad forgot her in the car when she was little and left her there to bake in the heat! They were never home, and even when they were home, they didn't care, remaining in a state of blissful oblivion. And no explanation was ever given as to why her parents didn't care. They just didn't. {I actually think this was Stiefvater's loophole for allowing Sam to stay in Grace's room without fear of being caught.}<br /><br />The cure for being a werewolf barely made any sense to me. I ran it through my head a few times, and still came up fuzzy. Maybe it's just because I suck at science, though, but that was kind of an odd resolution.<br /><br />But, these things aside, I really did enjoy the book.

Warner may as well be synonymous with the term \\"Classic Rip-off\\", as you are clearly a group of buffoons with not a single brain among you. Hang your heads low, Warner. I seriously hope you can feel shame. We who spend our money on your product deserve so much better.
044654759X|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a master storyteller. In this, his 16th book, he includes his overall theme of love, but also adds an element of suspense and danger. Katie is a woman running away from something, and when she arrives to Southport, South Carolina, she seems to be happy and safe from her past. But of course, nothing stays perfect forever, and she must choose between a life of love and safety, or one of riskier rewards.    Overall, the story starts slow, but it is a great read. It is your typical Nicholas Sparks book, but that is not a bad thing! Well-written, descriptive and an interesting plot, with unforgettable characters.     I would recommend this book to his fans, of course, but also any newcomers, as this was one of his better novels. Where The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, and Dear John dealt mostly with true love and romance, this one adds the element of real suspense, which makes for an interesting read.
0312600844|2.0|I downloaded this book to my Kindle to enjoy during a recent beach trip based on Oprah's recommendation.  She must not have read it.  I'm glad I was only interested in having SOMETHING to read during this relaxing time because this book is very flat.  The plot goes nowhere.  I found that Jonathan Franzen flips between timelines before having fully developed characters.  There were several times I started a new section and it took me pages before I could understand it was a continuation of a plot line from several chapters earlier.  Basically the plot is boring with a dull ending.  It's not a book I would remember, talk about, or recommend to my friends.

B003V5PPZG|4.0|Even though the songs are really different from the other cds... they are also great. Nobody or at least no one of the bands that everybody knows has try different sounds before as they do! It's excellent.<br />At the beginning, with this song: The Catalyst, i thought that they had changed a lot and maybe I wouldn't like this new cd, but finally I decided to buy it and I don't regret it at all!<br />I recommend that to you if you are a big fan of Linkin Park even if their music is soooo weird! it's excellent!
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Not too much to say here.  I love the movie and received it in the mail in less than a week!  The price on amazon was over 50% cheaper than the $24 Target wants, and $30 that Best Buy wants.  Not only did I get the DVD super fast and in great condition, this edition also comes with a digital copy, so I was able to put it on my iPod as well!
0743289692|5.0|After 300-plus 5-star reviews there's not much to say but the obvious. If there IS such a thing as several centuries from now, the Rushdie affair will be the Galileo case of Islam; this woman may well be its Frederick Douglass. An autobiography, certainly, but it's also a travelogue-with-political-comments: a tour through an alternative universe, complete with sub-universes, that its readers will never see (for which they can be deeply grateful). But there's something else going on here -- as you follow the events, and her wry comments on them, you can see, and are clearly MEANT to see, the gradual formation of a philosophy. This book is, in a way, \\"A Portrait of the Artist\\" and \\"The Dogs of War\\" at once -- but it's REAL. Her conclusions aren't surprising. The primacy of reason, the right to use that reason, and the responsibility to use it for the common good are built into the human genome (so it's also unsurprising that she's friends with Richard Dawkins). She sees the Islam she's escaped from as radically opposed to this -- a dark-age \\"idealistic\\" pseudo-philosophy with totalitarian pretensions (shades of Arendt and Popper here) that is currently doing more damage than it can ever cure. The U. N. Declaration cannot be read to square with Islam, so it's not up to the West to accomodate Islam -- it's the reverse. Dar-al-Islam needs to get ruthlessly honest with itself, and resign itself to genuine reform, or disappear, and the moderate Muslims and PC enablers who delude themselves otherwise are only compounding the problem.   Check out AHA's Youtube videos and you'll get a sense of what goes on here. There's a truly charismatic sense of quiet that surrounds her like an aura -- quiet dignity, warmth, humor, self-assurance. Especially check out her \\"debate\\" with Tariq Ramadan with the title \\"Islam is not a Western Religion.\\" Ramadan can't wait to interrupt her and bully her, with a righteous indignation he undoubtedly rehearsed that morning in the bathroom, until Christiane Amanpour has to yell him into silence. There sits AHA, shaking her head at TR's vulgarity, grinning her brains out. She knows she won.   And it's great to know that in this entropic universe someone can occasionally win who deserves to.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This adapter makes it possible to charge my iPhone while it is still in it's Otter Box case. It works great with our quad charger, so now all the iPods and iTouch phones can charge together in one place. Definitely worth the price if you have the Otter Box case (which, in my opinion, is the best case out there for protection)

B00368PSN2|4.0|Very entertaining movie that was sent as a new Blu-ray covered in plastic just as if I were to buy it new in the store.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|HELL YEAHZZ!!!! This movie was way better than I expected! I'm gonna confess now. I was never a fan of Disney Princess movies. Snow White bored me, the best part of Little Mermaid was Ursala, Beauty and the Beast was good, and Cinderela was tolerable. Princess and the Frog on the other hand not only entertained me all the way through, but wasn't as cliche as most princess movies. For one this is the first Princess movie to have a sista as the main character. Usually its either a white girl or minority girl who falls in love with a white guy (Pocohantas, Notre Dome, ect.). It takes place in 20th century New Orleans and not during the 1800's or farther like most of the Princess movies.      On top of that I just really love the characters and setting. My mom watched this before me and actually cried on that part near the end involving the firefly, which I'm not gonna explain because I don't want to give spoilers. I love how it captures the feel of New Orleans. The colors and animation were just gorgeous. It shows how long its been since I've seen a hand drawn animated movie. A really huge breathe of fresh air from these CGI animated movies Disney and other companies concentrate on. Don't get me wrong I love many CGI movies, but in a way its taking away from the magic, art, and charm hand drawn animated movies provide. ITs becoming kind of dull too. Just look back on the diversity in artstyle in movies like Watership down, old Don Bluth films, and Miyozaki movies(I could go on) and compare them to the diversity in todays CGI movies. Heck look at some anime too. If you look at CGI movies some of them replicate each other expecially in how the humans look. I think its because some of them try to look too realistic, but thats just an assumption.     I assume PATF takes place between the 1920-1940's. According to Spill.com the movie even starts out with an old Orleans song and alot of songs in the movie are done in a New Orleans style. As you who already saw the movie allready know the best song is definately the Shadowman song. ARE YA READY!!! ARE YA READY!! Man I might need to MP3 that. Its definately one of the best villians songs ever. Plus voodoo scares me anyway, so thats a plus.     Princess and the Frog is an extremely good movie. ITs nice to see Disney get back to its roots and actually make a cartoon. Its kind of a let down that the first in so long is a Princess movie, but its still a great change. Hopefully other companies will start doing handdrawn animation too. I love this movie and recommend it to everyone who wants the old Disney back. Check it out.
B00005JKC3|3.0|This was an interesting take on the Hulk although a bit misguided in its stretch of the original story.<br />I'm still not sure about the computer generated green guy, but the movie is worth buying for all of the Jennifer Connelly close ups.
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|Iam a Clapton fan for about 35 years,  I pre order the cd, thinking it was going to be a kick-ass cd... but when i played it,  one track was worst than the other. It was like he forgot how to play the guitar, at this this point Clapton should give it up..  i know everyone gets older, but come on, do what you do best. It's not even a good blues cd. I should have previewed the cd first, it was a waste of my money...
B000VDDDY6|5.0|\\"Star Trek\\" is a franchise that many people like to dismiss for various reasons.  Perhaps it's the showier acting from William Shatner.  Perhaps it's the 60s music score.  Perhaps it's the costumes and production quality. Perhaps it's the intense cult following it has.  Perhaps it's just because it's science-fiction.  Who knows?  Bottom line is this: I doubt the naysayers have taken the time to digest this incredible 1st season of \\"Star Trek\\". How could a show with such wonderful questions about humanity, leadership, morality, and discovery be so dismissed?  My guess, people are looking at the surface too much and have watched too many parodies and mockeries.  I've always been a fan, but ever since I took the time to watch this Re-mastered DVD set from start to finish, I am begging people to give this show a serious chance.    I've provided an episode-by-episode breakdown in the hopes of convincing you...as well as just for my general amusement and reflections.  I've placed it at the end because this review will be too long for Amazon guidelines.    \\"Star Trek\\" wasn't a huge success in the 1960s.  Its 3 seasons only gained popularity when they were re-run in the 1970s.  After watching how strong the show began, it puzzles me that people didn't want to give it more of a strong run compared to other run-of-the-mill programming.  \\"Star Trek\\" is often remembered for its sci-fi action, alien worlds, strange catchphrases, and occasionally-dated production.  One aspect the show doesn't get nearly enough credit for is its acting.  That's right...\\"Acting\\".  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley make a terrific team as our three lead roles as the strong-willed Captain Kirk, the logical and emotionally-restrained Spock, and the passionately blunt Dr. McCoy.  Nimoy's performance as Spock often got the most recognition for playing a character that everyone could relate to: the outcast whose scientific and distanced way of thinking often made him the go-to guy whensituations were dire.  In a way, Spock was the one we all thought we needed to be.  Kirk, on the other hand, was the one we all wanted to be.  His courage and willingness to get his hands dirty and assume responsibility are among the most admirable qualities in a human being.  The great thing about Shatner is that you can tell from his facial expressions that when his crew are in danger, he feels their pain.  There's a terrific episode in which a newlywed has lost his life during combat --- Kirk's expression of pain in the face of duty says it all.  And McCoy is the one to keep us in.  He's our voice of emotion, the one who says what he feels because someone's gotta break the laws of duty and logic.  He's out gut reaction, and Kelley is a very welcome change-of-pace from the other doctors \\"Star Trek\\" tried to use before `Bones' McCoy.    As I hope you'll see in my upcoming episode synopses, \\"Star Trek\\" (its first 2 seasons anyway) had a great selection of adventures putting humanity and morality to the test.  Although the characters wouldn't endure life-changing events from one show to the next, you can feel what they're feeling during the episode itself.  The most underrated aspect of this original \\"Star Trek\\" series is its drama and its combination of sci-fi adventure and explorations of morals & ethics.    I won't say a whole lot about the Re-mastered effects, except that I think they actually improve the show.  Every single episode with new effects (probably all of them) is better because while they look sharper and less fake, they still respect the original photography and spirit of the 1960s broadcasts.  There's really not much to gripe about unless you're a purist who only wants the original product.  If you're willing to accept a little shine here and there, jump right in.  It's the rare update that works (sorry George Lucas).    The third and final season of \\"Star Trek\\" wasn't very good, but judging from this impressive 1st season, you wouldn't have guessedit would've ended up that way.      (Quick Note - Don't let the chronological Star Dates confuse you with your DVD sets.  Just watch the show from Disc 1 onward.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, shoot me a comment.)       *****EPISODE REVIEWS*****  1) The Man Trap  ---Sadly, this is one of the weakest episodes of the season, as officers from the Enterprise notice a scientist's wife has a different appearance to each man's eyes.  Suddenly, officers are being found dead on the remote planet.  Gee, wonder who might be responsible for it?  (6.5 / 10)    ------------------------------    2) Charlie X  ---The Enterprise is tasked with carrying a young boy whose emotional needs grow dangerous when he doesn't get his way.  Starts promising enough, with some good questions about how the crew should handle a young man's struggles with adulthood.  Unfortunately, the psychological strategy to save the ship isn't entirely convincing.  (7.0 / 10)    ------------------------------    3) Where No Man Has Before  ---This is the pilot that got \\"Star Trek\\" launched into a weekly TV show, and it's actually one of my favorites.  After encountering a dangerous space storm, an officer and a visiting psychologist begin to exhibit God-like abilities.  I love this episode because it shows the real anguish that Kirk feels with imprisoning and (possibly) killing one of his best friends when his ego cannot control his newfound powers.  And the psychologist's resistance to reason and fascination with power is very well-developed.  The final fistfight is a bit much, but since it helped get \\"Star Trek\\" on the air, I'll forgive it.  (9.5 / 10)    ------------------------------    4) The Naked Time  ---One of the funnier episodes, as crew members contract a disease from an abandoned outpost, causing madness aboard the Enterprise.  Memorable images include the iconic sword-bearing Sulu, as well as a navigator taking over the Engine Room, giving hilarious announcements about ice cream socials and formal dances.  And how the Enterprise is saved from crashing into the planet is...unexpected.  (8.0 / 10)    ------------------------------    5) The Enemy Witihin  ---A malfunction with the Enterprise strands on a freezing planet below, while the ship is boarded by...Captain Kirk's evil clone!  Aside from some unintentionally funny moments (\\"IIIIIIIIIIII'M CAPTAIN KIRRRRRRRRK!\\"), this is a compelling story where Kirk's personality has literally been split into two people, with the ability to command being within the darker side.  While it might feel repetitive to have yet another \\"chaos-aboard-the-Enterprise/imposter\\" episode, this one manages to overcome those possible slipups.  (8.5 / 10)    ------------------------------    6) Mudd's Women  ---This episode feels pretty dated, but the first half of it is interesting as a smuggler/hustler is transporting three women so beautiful that they distract the attentions of the ship's crew.  The episode missteps when it deals with the truth and consequences behind the ladies' beauty.  I don't want to give it away for new viewers, but I believe most will find the message to be a product of the 60s.  (7.5 / 10)    ------------------------------    7) What Are Little Girls Made Of?  ---I don't think episode gets nearly enough credit.  Captain Kirk and Nurse Chapel beam down to a famous archaeologist's dig site.  Dr. Corby was once engaged to Nurse Chapel, and then disappeared for 5 years.  But matters get more complicated when Corby's giant bodyguard kills off two security guards in order to imprison Kirk and Chapel.  If you can get past Corby's giant bodyguard and the sexy assistant, there is a great story about how robots can never replace mankind.  There's also some touching moments as both Nurse Chapel and the assistant struggle to show feelings for men who are so unlike them.  (9.5 / 10)    ------------------------------    8) Miri  ---While some very 60s elements rear their ugly heads into the episode, this is still a very fine story as the crew stranded on an Earth-like planet race to find a cure for a plague that will kill them in less than a week.  Things get more interesting when they find a young woman hiding out, while a gang of children taunts and prevents the crew from getting modern technology to research a cure.  The gang of kids are very corny, except for Michael J. Pollard as their leader.  And how Kirk manages to reason with them is a bit hard to believe they'd listen (same problem with the \\"Charlie X\\" episode).  But overall, this is a very solid race-against-time episode.  (8.0 / 10)    ------------------------------    9) Dagger of the Mind  ---I've yet to find anyone who loves this episode as much as I do.  When a prison inmate stows away onto the Enterprise, further examination reveals he was formerly a scientist working for the reform facility.  Things get darker and more disturbing when Kirk and a former love interest find out how exactly the prison rehabilitates its prisoners.  Throw in the first use of Spock's ability to mind-meld and a thriller that never lets up, you've got a cutting-edge classic.  There are plenty of beloved \\"Star Trek\\" episodes, but this hidden gem deserves more recognition.  (10 / 10 Perfect!)    ------------------------------    10) The Corbomite Maneuver  ---This episode has a terrific buildup, a nail-biting premise that goes on a little too long, and a love-it-or-hate-it ending.  A space buoy of great power follows the Enterprise everywhere it navigates in space.  When they finally resort to destroying it, an unknown species threatens to use their power to destroy the ship, leaving them only 10 minutes to prepare for their ultimate doom.  If that doesn't get your attention, I don't know what will.  Kirk comes up with a clever plan to delay their destruction.  What the crew eventually discovers about their opponent is totally unpredictable; whether that's good or not depends on your taste.  I actually liked it, especially aftera wonderful final line of dialogue that sums up Captain Kirk pretty well.  (8.5 / 10)    ------------------------------    11) & 12) The Menagerie: Parts I & II  ---This is a tough two-parter to critique.  On the one hand, it's a glorified reason to replay \\"The Cage\\", the very first pilot of \\"Star Trek\\" that was turned down for various reasons.  On the other hand, the story of how Christopher Pike (former captain of the Enterprise) was challenged and tested on the forbidden planet Talos IV hadn't been shown to viewers when this two-parter premiered.  There are some surprising elements when Spock deceives and manipulates the Enterprise to return to Talos IV, testing the Kirk/Spock relationship like never before.  Overall, if you've seen or know a lot about \\"The Cage\\", the new story might not be enough for you.  But if you have no idea what \\"The Cage\\" is, you're in for a very unique vision of what \\"Star Trek\\" almost was.  Either way, it's a credit to the writers and production team that they turned they gave this gimmick a few surprising plot twists and a dramtically-satisfying ending.  (8.0 / 10)    ------------------------------     13) The Conscience of the King  ---This episode can't really be called \\"sci-fi\\", but instead you get a terrific drama with true Shakespearean pathos.  The premise is a bit light at first: Could the veteran actor of an interstellar acting troupe really be a longdead dictator?  If so, is he responsible for a couple attempted murders?  The reason this episode succeeds very well is because of 'HOW' it's told, as it uses a lot of unique storytelling devices.  An engineer gets temporary relief when Uhura plays a beautiful song over the speaker, unaware that he's about to be poisoned.  When Kirk confronts his alleged nemesis (played terrifically by Arnold Moss), their dialogue reveals painful depths about the two men.  How can Kirk know if he's right?  And if so, who cares?  The story begins and ends during Shakespeare plays, and the way the playwright's words are used to punctuate the drama is amazing.  (9.5 / 10)    ------------------------------     14) Balance of Terror  ---Rightfully remembered as one of the best \\"Star Trek\\" episodes.  In short, the Enterprise races to investigate space outposts that are being attacked along the border between Federation space and the mysterious Romulans.  What ensues is a suspenseful battle in space, as both starships seek to destory the other, before the other can report that a peace treaty has been violated.  Although the Re-mastered special effects make this episode better, the reason it really works is because the camera and script focus on the characters' reactions, rather than just creating a visual space battle.  Also, special credit must be given to Mark Lenard's superb performance as the Romulan Commander.  The finale is also a heartbreaker, as Kirk must deal with the death of one of his crew.  (9.0 / 10)    ------------------------------     15) Shore Leave  ---The best way I can describe this episode is that it's just one damn thing after another.  The Enterprise crew find a lush, beautiful planet that would be perfect for them to relax during their five-year mission.  However, the first few officers who explore the planet find experience some bizarre hallucinations.  It begins with Dr. McCoy seeing a giant white rabbit being followed by a girl who looks just like Alice of Wonderland.  All sorts of craziness occurs from a giant tiger prowling the planet to Kirk being tormented by his Irish bully from the Academy days.  In fact, the Kirk/Finnegan rivalry is one of the most comically insane threads of any \\"Star Trek\\" plot.  The ending is a tiny copout as everything wraps up a little too tidily.  But like the Enterprise crew, all I could do was just laugh at what the hell everybody just went through.  (10 / 10 I Loved It!)    ------------------------------     16) The Galileo Seven  ---This one takes a big chance of taking the often-infallible Spock, and making him even more unlikeable than in \\"The Menagerie\\".  A shuttlecraft is stranded on a planet within a space quasar.  Meanwhile, Captain Kirk's efforts to rescue them are constantly scolded by a galactic commissioner who only gives Kirk a few days before meeting a deadline for delivering medical supplies.  Spock's non-emotional, logical leadership starts to wear down on the other 6 officers who fear they may never leave the planet alive.  With no fuel and attacking creatures, the situation becomes dire very fast.  This episode has one major problem: the attacks on the Galileo Seven party are laughably bad.  Gigantic spears look phony, and the creatures' close-quarters attacks are as slow as zombies.  Plus, the nagging commissioner aboard the Enterprise is very one-note.  This is a very good episode that explores some gray areas within Spock, but the faulty aspects stick out pretty bad.  (8.0 / 10)    ------------------------------     17) The Squire of Gothos  ---In many ways, this is what the \\"Charlie X\\" episode should've been.  After Captain Kirk and Sulu vanish from the bridge, the party sent to investigate the nearby planet finds that they've been taken from a charming egotistical being who fancies his lifestyle after the romanticising of European wars (Napolean for example).  What's so great about this episode is that Trelane (the villain played with great relish by William Campbell) doesn't have a deep philosophy for his actions.  He's simply a bored unknown entity who just wants some humans to play with and has no moral boundaries whatsoever, despite how well-educated he appears to be.  It's a frightening situation with a great nemesis, and the way the Enterprise crew struggles to reason their way out of this one is something to behold.  (9.0 / 10)    ------------------------------     18) Arena  ---Action-packed is the best way to summarize this episode.  When the Enterprise crew finds an Earth colony has been bombarded by an alien race, Kirk goes on a vengeful mission to lead the Enterprise to hunt down the attackers.  However, his anger will soon cost him as an unseen race called The Metrons force the pursuit to stop.  Furthermore, they force Kirk and The Gorn to battle it out on an isolated planet.  Winner gets to leave, the loser's ship will be destroyed.  I'm surprised how the unlikely story of an obsessive Captain Kirk is very well-told, and his redemption is compelling.  But quite frankly, the one-on-one battle with The Gorn is bad even by 60s standards, and when the Enterprise is conveniently allowed to watch, it insults our intelligence a bit.  I wish this one had trusted the audience more to enjoy the story, but besides those missteps, this one's a keeper.  (8.0 / 10)    ------------------------------     19) Tomorrow Is Yesterday  ---The great thing about this episode is that when the Enterprise accidentally travels back in time to the 1960s, it deals with the consequences seriously.  After saving an Air Force pilot's life and escaping Earth's orbit, everyone must cope with how either the 1960s or the 23rd Century timelines will be changed forever.  The Enterprise can't risk sending the pilot back to Earth because he could use his newfound knowledge to change the world, but wouldn't detaining him be just as wrong?  After all, the unsuspecting pilot was only doing his duty when he stumbled upon their vessel.  There are a lot of great elements.  When Kirk & Sulu sneak into the Air Force base, the story gets a bit ridiculous.  But it's all in good fun.  Like many \\"Star Trek\\" episodes, it may wrap up a little too neatly and too quickly, but all in all, this one is another strong effort.  (8.5 / 10)    ------------------------------    20) Court Martial  ---It may be a little redundant having two officer-on-trial episodes in this first season.  The difference is that in \\"The Menagerie\\", Spock was well aware of his guilty actions.  In this courtroom mystery, Kirk is absolutely certain he is innocent, and actuallychallenges the trial to take him on.  It's a fascinating premise, made more interesting that a former love interest must dutifully prosecute Kirk to the fullest extent of the law.  The lawyer that Kirk employs is also a neat character, a man who tries to get the heart of the law.  The big problem working against this episode is that Captain Kirk is such a believable character that it's obvious that someone made a mistake somewhere with this trial, making his guilt pretty much a falsehood.  And since \\"Star Trek\\" isn't known for long-term consequences, we trust that all will be well before the hour is up.  But for what it is and how well it sustains its premise, \\"Court Martial\\" is good from start to finish.  (8.0 / 10)    ------------------------------     21) The Return of the Archons  ---This one's plot has a very bizarre & intriguing start, as people on a planet (dressed like late 19th century Earth) are under a constant trance, speaking in tongues, praising \\"Landru\\".  Somehow, the investigating crew find shelter with a few people who fear Landru, but speak plainly enough to be of some help.  Unfortunately, I thought this one drags for a while, finally gaining much-needed momentum in its final act.  Furthermore, the cult/religion of the Archons is never fully explained, with Kirk & Spock solving the mystery before we can even follow how they did it.  It's not a bad episode, but I loved some of it, while getting restless during other parts.  (7.5 / 10)    ------------------------------     22) Space Seed  ---Even if \\"Star Trek II\\" had never taken place, this TV episode would rightfully be remembered for being a masterful piece of work.  The Enterprise find a wandering spaceship with its passengers cryogenically-frozen.  The one they wake up turns out to be a grave mistake.  First and foremost, Khan (amazingly played by Ricardo Montalban) is one of the best antagonists in all of TV.  As he says, he's superior in every way to the normal man.  Khan is very strong, supremely intelligent, romantically appealing to women (particularly an Enterprise historian), and a man who hungers for global conquest.  The way Khan interacts with any member of the Enterprise crew is well-executed and gripping.  His attempts to gain control of the Enterprise are patient and subtle.  And when Khan begins to execute his plan, this episode is constantly exciting.  And even if we never got a 2nd \\"Star Trek\\" movie, the final words between Kirk and the crew are harrowing.  If you're gonna watch only one episode of \\"Star Trek\\", make it this one.  (10 / 10 Totally Mesmerizing!)    ------------------------------     23) A Taste of Armageddon  ---What a delightfully strange concept this episode has.  Basically, Captain Kirk and his crew beam down to a planet that appears peaceful, but they insist that they've been at war for a nearby planet for 500 years, killing millions of each other's inhabitants.  The catch: They don't really kill each other; instead, the two engage in 'computerized' war games, and agree to sacrifice their own people so that 'real' nuclear weapons won't be used.  There are so many opportunities for implicating society and creating nail-biting suspense, and I think this story takes advantage of all of them.  There is a Federation diplomat onboard the Enterprise who has command of the ship, and for once, it's not a one-note character.  This diplomat wants to sincerely bring good relations between the isolated planet and the Federation, but he has absolutely no idea what he's getting into.  Kirk and his crew beam down with peaceful news, but they are informed almost immediately that they've been chosen to die from the war games.  The action is plentiful, as Kirk's landing party fight to escape their own euthanasia, while the Enterprise must refrain from firing back at a planet who means to destory them.  And the questions posed to us --- Is it better to kill your own people rather than allow someone else's weapons to do so?  Do we have the right to intervene with another people's way of life if the earthly world isn't being harmed?  I loved just about every second of this episode, and I recommend it highly!  (10 / 10 Genius!)    ------------------------------     24) This Side of Paradise  ---This season continues to show its variety of concepts, themes, and tones.  Evidence: A love story for Spock?!  The Enterprise is ordered to bring some colonists off of their planet to another starbase.  The problem is that they're so healthy and so content that they don't want to leave.  Meanwhile, a woman who's loved Spock for years finally gets her chance when the Vulcan is infected with some plant spores that bring his emotions to the surface.  Soon, everyone but Kirk (conveniently) is exposed to the spores and refuses to keep the Enterprise running and leave the planet.  There's nothing really wrong with this episode, but for some reason, I wanted more from it.  Maybe I was underwhelmed by Kirk being the one who solves the mystery and saves the day.  But if for nothing else, this glimpse into Spock's heart is unforgettable.  (8.5 / 10)    ------------------------------     25) The Devil In The Dark  ---The way this story surpasses its simple premise is incredible: Some miners are being attacked by an unknown creature, and the Enterprise is tasked to stop it before it permenantly stops production & kills everyone on the planet.  But thanks to some smart pacing and a sensible mystery, it all works.  The Kirk/Spock dynamic is well-challanged: The Captain wants to save lives, while Spock doesn't want to miss an opportunity to research an unknown creature.  The way the two friends challenge and ultimately trust the other's philosophies is great stuff.  The cave creature is, at first, disappointing because it's typical monster-movie stuff where people are killed and you can't see it.  But once Kirk & Spock find the creature, it's a surprisingly sharp creation.  It moves convincingly in the way it breathes, the way it creeps, and the way it feels.  Dr. McCoy's involvement in the story is quite amusing, too.  Once you get past the monster-movie setup --- and forgive how the survivors fail to mourn the dead after surviving the ordeal --- this is another unforgettable episode.  (9.0 / 10)    ------------------------------     26) Errand of Mercy  ---Ah, the debut of the Klingons!  I don't think they could've done a better job of introducing these \\"Trek\\" icons into the universe.  The peaceful planet of Organia is caught in the crossfire between the Federation and Klingon battles in space.  But when Kirk and Spock beam down to convince the primitive Organians to allow the Federation to assist them, they refuse simply because they denounce any kind of violence, regardless if it's in self-defense.  When the Klingon occupation begins, Kirk and Spock are the only ones who want their tyrannical reign to end.  Special credit must go to John Abbott & John Colicos as the Organian Elder and Klingon Commander Kor, respectively, for their great performances here.  The Organians' peaceful reaction to all of this is off-putting to us, which is part of the story's lesson.  And when Kor & Kirk engage in their verbal battles of wits, you can't take your eyes off the screen.  My only big gripe is that I can't decide if the episode's big reveal at the end was supposed to be expected, or if it was supposed to be a surprise.  In a way, I was underwhelmed by either solution because there's a big cheat in the middle of the episode that keen-eyed viewers will notice.  But it still makes for a powerful ending, and makes us question the way we wanted the violent adventure to continue.  (9.0 / 10)    ------------------------------    27) The Alternative Factor  ---Man, this episode really fumbles after a decent start.  Basically, there are inexplicable storms that are causing damage to ships across the entire galaxy.  The Enterprise learns that a maniacal space traveler aboard an empty planet seems to be thecause.  How he's involved with these storms isn't too surprising, because there about 5 of them throughout the story.  But the bigger problem is that they keep leaving this traveler alone when they shouldn't.  Dr. McCoy literally sits by the Sickbay's door, and yet the traveler still escapes and wanders the ship's corridors to cause damage...TWICE!  The whole episode is repetitve, and fails to live up to any potential it had.  I suppose it's watchable one time, but it's a harsh blemish on such a terrific season.  (5.5 / 10)    ------------------------------    28) The City On The Edge Of Forever  ---This episode is routinely called the greatest of \\"Star Trek\\", and I can't blame them.  This is one of the most creative, inventive, and dramatic stories from this Original Series.  It's bit chaotic at first: Dr. McCoy is accidentally drugged to the point of madness, and he escapes to a nearby planet with a time-traveling portal.  When he jumps through, the Enterprise realizes that he somehow changed history.  They all agree to jump in, and try to stop McCoy from altering history.  Kirk and Spock arrive in the Great Depression, and while they try to use 20th century technology to research the point where McCoy changed history, Kirk falls in love with a marvelous woman.  Edith Keeler runs a mission, takes in Kirk & Spock out of kindness, and pays them to work so that they can buy supplies for their own purposes.  To me, this episode has one too many coincidences: How in the world can Kirk & Spock be absolutely sure that Dr. McCoy is going to arrive at their point in time?  But the strong acting and moving story make it all work, with special thanks to Joan Collins as the warm-hearted visionary who reaches Kirk's heart like nobody else had before.  This episode is truly a classic among classics, and has earned its reputation as one of the \\"Star Trek\\" greats.  (9.5 / 10)    ------------------------------    29) Operation: Annihilate!  ---We now know that the \\"Space Seed\\" episode was the genesis (no pun intended) for the 2nd \\"Star Trek\\" movie, but at the time, this season finale was the first episode that felt like there could be long-term consequences from a given episode.  A colony's citizens have been going insane.  Their nervous systems are shutting down.  Kirk's brother's family are on this very planet.  And one of his closest officers is viciously attacked by the parasites that have infested the colony, possibly with permenant damage.  The stakes feel greater than ever, because every waking moment shows Kirk, Spock, and McCoy dealing with the possible death of millions of people.  Although this episode isn't one of the season's very best, it's still a very solid way to go off the air for a while.  (8.0 / 10)
0756405890|5.0|I loved this story.  I generally skim through parts of books, the descriptions will be too long the dialogue too corny, but this was perfect. I loved how the author set it up, I was curious about Kuothe's story before his story even began.  My only complaint is that it's a trilogy - I have a love/hate relationship with trilogies - I hate having to wait to read the rest of the story but love that there is more to read. I hope Day 2 is as good as Day 1.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This is a movie about a retired Marine who gets a little lost and finds his way home. A man who served his country, his family and his community. I've known a few like the main character and Eastwood does an excellent job portraying him. He reminded me of my Uncle Jack. Hero (Medals and all), WWII and Korea. I saw the show in the theater and decided I wanted a copy to save. It's a great guy flick.

B002ISID10|3.0|If you are a fan of Bring Me The Horizon you will eaither love this band or you will ultimately hate this band. Asking Alexandria does a good job at keeping you interested with they're simple but heavy breakdowns and they're Dance/Trance beats but let's go over the album as a whole.    *Negative*  So the first song I ever heard from Asking Alexandria was \\"The Final Episode\\", it started off pretty strong and had me going up until the vocalist screamed the words \\"Oh My God\\" over and over in unison with the breakdown. If that wasn't bad enough I had to endure the overly annoying 2-string picking that happened right before the vocalist screamed \\"OMG\\". Also, they do this a lot through out the album which really annoys me.    *Positive*  By now (if you are a fan) you probably hate me for the negative comments. At least with this band there are some redeeming qualities! For instance, after the slow, boring, cliche breakdown it gets kind of interesting. Finally, the Trance beat comes in and even though it really isn't much it still seperates the dull boring part of the song from the awesome parts. Somewhere near the end of the song you can actually hear how intricate some of the guitar parts are. In fact rather than playing in the scale they were playing in they change it up with some augmented notes that make it sound amazing.    As for the rest of the album, it all sounds the same in my opinion. It's like they are afraid to deviate from the formula that they made themselves and rather than being innovative and experiment a little they tend to always open up with a breakdown or a really simple riff. It really sucks because if you listen to one of they're songs only half of it is worth listening to....but that's my opinion.    If you are really into Post-Hardcore bands or Metal-Core you should at least check this band out on Youtube because if you buy it you are only getting half of what you payed for.    Also! If you are into Bring Me The Horizon you will most likely thinkthat this band is a crappy version of BMTH with Dance beats.

B0014C0BMU|4.0|BUSINESS INSIGHTS<br />An entrepreneurial colleague asked if I'd seen The Matrix. Said he believes it and that's how he runs his business. So I put my name on the waiting list at the library. Turned out, I got _Revolutions_ with the library code taped over the title so I didn't know what I had without searching it out. I did realize when the film started that something was missing. (I'd seen the first in the trilogy years ago.)<br /><br />Some of my notes:<br /><br />\\"No one can see beyond a choice they don't understand.\\" -- The Oracle (perhaps the most profound line in the film, and, in my opinion, the crux of both the film and of business)<br /><br />We are each good and evil - the savior and the destroyer.<br /><br />Some things in this world never change. Luckily, some things do.<br /><br />\\"Did you always know?\\" (Neo to Oracle) \\"No,\\" Oracle to Neo, \\"but I believed.\\"<br /><br />There's more, of course.<br /><br />PACING: Though the battle scenes are the most technologically advanced in history, they were a little long for my taste. They added little to the plot, and were basically visual candy for people who like that sort of thing.<br /><br />EXTRA FEATURES: Revolutions Recalibrated<br /><br />I watched as much as I could of the extra features, the making of the film and the behind the scenes footage. It's astonishing how live action, animation, miniatures, and computer graphics flowed together -- as the director said, they used every form and technology available - including processes that were not available when the first movie came out. How they blended them all together - flawlessly - is amazing.<br /><br />It was also entertaining to watch Keanu Reeves lie down in a pool of muddy water - smiling - and informative to hear Jada Pinkett Smith talk about the amount of bruises sustained during filming.<br /><br />While sometimes seeing how special effects are created can dilute the magic of a film, in this case, I think the revelations enhanced its power.<br /><br />THE GAME<br />Disc 2 also introduces the Matrix online game, playable by thousands of people simultaneously who script it as they play. Must be a gamer's paradise.taneously who script it as they play. Must be a gamer's paradise.
B0043X7WLA|4.0|I don't want to like this album. I was annoyed by BQE and frustrated that it'd been so long since Sufjan had released any true new material. Illinoise is that preternatural, near-perfect album--with a depth and character and texture all its own, with whimsy and silliness but an overarching narrative and true grace--accessible, delicious music.    The Age of Adz is neither accessible, nor whimsical, nor near-perfect. Instead, it takes a dark turn: built around the artwork of paranoid schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson, it is at once jarring and frustrating, but taunts with a depth and engagement unlike that of anything in recent memory.    This is not friendly music. It is not easy listening. It is a journey, and an uphill one at that. It challenges you to keep up and tolerate it a bit more, offering its hand, letting you get comfortable with its strange grasp before tearing it away and slapping you in the face.     But there is something captivating throughout the entire album. A few songs drag in a way that forces me to consider skipping them every time, but I find that's because incredibly slow songs run that risk with me unless I'm in a particular mood. Underneath the electronica, the pop and circumstance, the experimental robot overlord swells, there lies a consistent thread: it begs you to really listen to what's happening here. It wants you to dive deeper. If you stick with it, it will force you to re-examine the elements you wrote off as silly or masturbatory or obnoxious and see that they're placed with a tweezer and magnifying glass instead of scattershot against the wall to see what would stick. And that's the real victory of The Age of Adz.    This album is entirely not for everyone. It's not for most people. There's a completely decent possibility it's not even for me. But I keep listening to it, discovering there's more to it each pass, and finding the complex melodies and strange noises and pops and flares are stuck in my head. And I don't want themto leave.

I enjoy the sarcastic humor and how it is not afraid to talk about topics like religion and race, like some other people have noted.  Since my friends come from all ages and backgrounds, I like that part of the show.  I am really enjoying the DVD since every single episode has commentary available!  I also like all of the outtakes- they are hilarious.  I really hope there are many more seasons to come!  Plus Joel McHale is reason alone to watch the show.  :)

I like a lot of fans before torrent sites came along, paid for a boot copy (dubbed from vhs) and were content on knowing and believing that this footage would never be cleaned up. We had a projecting viewing party and were grinning from ear to ear from start to finish. After Midnight Rambler my friend turned to me and said he felt like he needed to take a shower. I'm not sure how I can understand some of the negativity from this release.  I'm the biggest Mike Taylor fan there is and yes, I wish there were more shots of him and Keith, but you can't always get what you want!!!! No, it's not Avitar in 3-D, it's the Stones shot on 8mm in 1972. If you can free your mind of that, then your Holy-Grail awaits.

B00177Y9ZC|4.0|This movie is just plain fun.  Don't look for deep meaning, complex imagery, or complexity.  There are just good-bad people against bad-good people.  The main character robs banks and his enemies are tying to protect humanity from people with special powers.  It gets no more real than a Marvel Comic, but it is still fun.  This is not Bladerunner, 2001, or Soylent Green.  It is a very enjoyable film from beginning to end.  Don't think too hard and just let it wash over you.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|First things first, I think this is the funniest sitcom since [[ASIN:B000JJ3Y78 Arrested Development]], but it also dares to be heartwarming by the end of each episode. Thanks to the laser-piercing sharpness of the writing, it continually gets away with such a potentially fatal combination and has become that all-too-rare show that I schedule my otherwise hectic life around - even if the individual episodes are available on the ABC Web site hours after they air. Created by Christopher Lloyd ([[ASIN:B000ERVJLI Frasier]]) and Steven Levitan ([[ASIN:B003NHMYJW The Larry Sanders Show]]), the show offered two-dozen episodes during its premiere season, all of which are included along with several worthy extras in this four-disc set.<br /><br />The premise is simple and the format quite familiar. It centers on the families of Jay Pritchett, his daughter Claire, and his son Mitchell, all of whom live close to each other in Los Angeles. The format is a sitcom under the guise of a mockumentary (much like Christopher Guest's best films, [[ASIN:B00005LC5D Waiting for Guffman]] and [[ASIN:B00005ALS0 Best in Show]]), which allows all the characters to express their honest opinions about each other, primarily exposing their personal idiosyncrasies and irritants. It's a tried-and-true approach, and in the expert hands of the writers involved, it works beautifully. Jay is the aging patriarch happily married to a much-younger Columbian spitfire of a wife, Gloria. He struggles to keep up with her energy and high-voltage temperament, while helping to raise her cherubic, pre-adolescent son, Manny, acting well beyond his tender years.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jay's high-strung daughter Claire is married with three kids of her own. Her realtor husband Phil is your typical one-step-behind dad who thinks he is much cooler than he is, while Claire's control-freak tendencies are a reflex to not only his affable, conflict-avoiding nature but to her hopeless inability to push her children (especially eldest daughter Haley) away from the apparent hellion she was as a teenager. But I have to admit my favorite dynamic on the show is between Jay's lawyer son Mitchell and his flamboyant life partner Cameron, a former music teacher. Instead of focusing entirely on their same-sex relationship, the creators wisely chose to focus on them as new, overcompensating parents to their adopted Vietnamese baby, Lily. It's really easy to endear yourself to this extended family who manage to generate genuine likability through their somewhat dysfunctional nature.<br /><br />The fact that Claire and Phil represent the only traditional family structure of the three makes an emotionally resonant comment on the acceptance of diversity in contemporary relationships that cross cultures, generations, same-sex barriers and overseas adoptions. What's more, the point is not hammered in any moralistic manner but through shrewd characterizations, relatable personal crises, and genuinely funny, laugh-out-loud outcomes. The show is also blessed with an excellent regular cast that starts with Ed O'Neill who manages to bring curmudgeonly warmth to his Al Bundy-like bluster as Jay. At first, Sofia Vergara's Gloria bordered a bit too much on stereotype, but as her own foibles were exposed, e.g., her self-denial over her bad driving and her hypersensitivity to any misconstrued comment about her heritage, she became far more relatable. Julie Bowen could have been the show's inevitable wet-rag, but she makes Claire's often unpopular stances as the sensible mom hilarious case studies in the slow burn, the dead-eyed stare and the double-take.<br /><br />As Mitchell, Jesse Tyler Ferguson superbly contrasts Mitchell's elitist attitude and discomfort with public displays of affection with a deeper need to squash his \\"mama's boy\\" reputation. Even with such keen competition, there are two standouts in this crack ensemble. In Steve Carell-like fashion, Ty Burrell makes Phil a hilarious doofus of a dad inclassic TV style, while Eric Stonestreet's Cameron is one of comedy's ingeniously lovable creations, an emotionally naked, over-the-top character who stays true to his corn-belt sensibilities. All the kid actors are great without being grating, and guest stars have turned in some stellar work. Most notable have been Shelley Long as Jay's new-age ex-wife unforgivable for \\"The Incident\\"; Fred Wiilard as Phil's evasive, joke-alike dad in \\"Travels with Scout\\"; and Elizabeth Banks as Cameron and Mitchell's perpetually drunk gal-pal Sal in \\"Great Expectations\\".<br /><br />Funny deleted and extended scenes and family interviews are included with most of the episodes on all four discs, but the fourth disc has the lion's share of extras including a gag reel. Also included is a ten-minute featurette, \\"Real Modern Family Moments\\", which amusingly shows that a lot of the situations depicted on the show are based on what really happened in the lives of the production team. There is also the looking-back \\"Before Modern Family\\", which showcases the principal actors before their casting on the show, and separately, there is a piece on Stonestreet's previous incarnation as \\"Fizbo the Clown\\". There is not one but two behind-the-scenes featurettes, \\"Making Modern Family: Family Portrait\\", which looks at the making of the first season finale, and \\"Modern Family Hawaii\\", which looks at the Hawaiian vacation episode.

1439133948|4.0|I've waited for this book for eight years, and just finished reading it, and... For readers of the entire series, it feels like the lightest book of the Vorkosigan universe. Funny, enjoyable, lots of chicanery and a heap of trouble with a squiggly-minded little man on top. But then you hit the end, and you realize that reading it lightly was a serious mistake. It was never light. Not once, though it may seem that way. Jin does not get his fairytale, though he is is given his life anew. And Miles isn't given his fairytale. Just his life, anew. I'm not sure whether to start reading this book over, or start reading the entire series over. It's one or the other, though, because one reading was not enough. I took it too lightly the first round.

1423113381|3.0|I was really excited to read this book because I loved the Percy Jackson book so much, but the truth is that it doesn't hold up to the Percy Jackson legacy.  It's not a bad book necessarily, but it just doesn't hold up to the high standards of Percy Jackson.  The plot is so information-packed, it's hard to follow.  In addition, it's told from Sadie and Carpenter's point of view, switching alternatively every chapter.  I didn't find it nearly as funny as the Percy Jackson books and harder to follow.  In addition, it was a fairly long book.  Maybe it's the switch between Greek and Egyptian mythology, but it just wasn't amazing.  Nothing in it really made me go, \\"Wow!\\" like in the PJ books.  Like I said, it's not a bad book, but definitely not as well written as the Percy Jackson books.
B00456PKG4|2.0|I watched this with my children.  Both had been fans of the videogame.  Both were extemely annoyed that this show did not follow the plot of the game at all.  In fact, both wanted to give the movie negative stars.<br /><br />On the other hand, since I haven't played videogames in approximately 10 years (ever since my children started kicking my butt), I had no such preconceptions.  It simply looked like a good adventure flick to me.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.<br /><br />My daughter's description of the show was simply that it looked like \\"they took the video game, wrapped Aladdin around it, and threw in bad guys who looked like the Nazgul from Lord of the Rings.\\"  I've got to agree that the film had all the depth and creativity of a film created via Disney marketing research experts.<br /><br />My children tell me that in the game, the prince was not a street-urchin like Aladdin. To the extent that he was rewritten to be like Aladdin, one can see the entrance of Disney focus groups and market research specialists.<br /><br />There is some good and bad acting in the film. Jake Gyllenhaal does a creditable job in a pretty standard action flick.  He doesn't look Persian, but then most of the cast didn't either.  Gyllenhaal's proto-English accent stayed in place pretty well.<br /><br />In contrast, the female lead was highly forgettable.  Through a major portion of the film, she seemed capable of only one line, \\"Give me the dagger!!\\"  After a while, she did change it to \\"It is my destiny!\\"  By that time, though, my son started screaming \\"Give me the dagger,\\" every time she came on the screen.<br /><br />For first class action sequences and good CGI, this is an OK flick to watch if you put your mind on idle and let the \\"creativity\\" of Disney Marketing Research lead you where they want.<br /><br />I can't let one last aspect go unmentioned.  Cliche ridden films increasingly have a stalwart black man who inevitably dies for the white hero.  This film continues that cliche.  Black supporting actors are treated like the Red Shirts from Star Trek TOS.  I wish that racial cliche could be put to rest.Red Shirts from Star Trek TOS.

142311339X|5.0|Fantastic book!  I love the new characters- they're different but nonetheless fantastic.  It's a bit lengthy but totally worth it.  I like Piper's spunk and personality.  Honestly, I did not give much thought to the Aphrodite cabin beforehand but it's cool to see that you don't have to be an airhead to be in the Aphrodite Cabin.  Leo is just....  Leo.  He's hilarious and pretty cool just the way he is.  Jason is a also a great character.  He's a leader more so than the others and has a kind of quiet strength about him.  I also liked how because of the way the novel was written, we get more of an idea about how Annabeth and other previous characters might appear to people who don't know them as well.  This book is written very well and I think it's a great followup to the Percy Jackson series.  There's humor, suspense, adventure, romance- everything you can hope for in a book.  I'd recommend it to any Percy Jackson lover!

B0028OF7TA|5.0|The Michael Jackson Collection offers you five of MJ's six solo albums, excluding 1995's HIStory. Another good thing is you get the special edition which has little extras here and there; it's not much but it's still bonus stuff (think demos, interviews and alternate versions). This collection is a cheap way of owning five of MJ's albums at once for a very decent price; I like how the CDs are individually packaged in Vinyl-like sleeves, so you can enjoy the artwork of each and have the five CDs individually as is not usually the case in a collection. Now you don't get HIStory or Blood on the Dance Floor (the remix album) but if you decide you want them you can buy them individually. That's why it's not a COMPLETE collection. If you really want Michael's albums this is a good way to do it, and while we're at it I'd suggest picking up a hits album of MJ's time in the Jackson 5/Jacksons so you have some his earlier work as well. For the price value this collection is five stars, plus the fact that you get the special editions with all the little extras makes it even better. There isn't much more to say really, this deserves 5 stars.
0783225857|5.0|After all these years, I finally read the book [[ASIN:0061743526 To Kill a Mockingbird: 50th Anniversary Edition]], soon to be followed up with this classic film.<br /><br />Over the years, I had seen tidbits of this movie on TV, so it was a real treat to finally view it in its entirety.<br /><br />Narrated in voice-over by \\"Scout,\\" we first glimpse the Southern lifestyle of the thirties as three children explore their neighborhood.  They are obsessed with catching a glimpse of Boo Radley, about whom much has been whispered amongst the neighbors.  Like many rumors, there is much more to the story, which will become apparent toward the end of the movie.<br /><br />The stark black and white images perfectly depicted the settings and the deprivation of this small town world.  Yet despite their lack of material trappings, the children found plenty to amuse themselves, utilizing their minds and their imaginations.<br /><br />The themes of the film are fear, racism, and integrity--and the latter trait was depicted most notably by Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch.<br /><br />The lessons in understanding and empathy came specifically from Atticus, as spoken to his children:  You never really know a person until you walk for awhile in his shoes.<br /><br />This film [[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)]] is still very relevant, despite the fact that some race relations have been improved.  The messages of acceptance and tolerance, as well as integrity, are still important today.<br /><br />Five stars.
B003XL6EKS|4.0|Powerful and soul-sharing solo effort by The Killers lead.  Lyrically great.  Musically you can really feel the missing influence of the rest of the band.  Solid album all around though.
B003VS0CYC|1.0|Well I have to say, I'm a huge RoboCop fan and I was excited to get this on Blu-Ray. I didn't find any extras on the case, so I thought it would be on the BR itself, But no dice. The DVD has more Xtras than the Blu-Ray. The 2nd and 3rd have only a trailer and being a being a huge Robocop fan,I was hoping they would have a lost featurette or new Commentaries. I was disappointed in this purchase and I wouldn't recommend this, I'd suggest to pick up the first single disc of the first movie. Oh well, Live and Learn. I'm keeping this though since I already bought it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I was very pleased with this seller. The item arrived in perfect condition, factory wrapped, no cracked case or anything. And the best part, it arrived 3 days before the scheduled delivery date (might help that I wasn't ordering around Christmas time :-). Very excited to get it so quickly. Would definitely use again. Thanks.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I love Star Wars but GL has altered these films once again! Now I think he did to see how many of us fans are gonna complain about his altered changes. Well he did a very good job of that by adding a \\"NOOOOO\\" into Vader in ROTJ which really is unnecessary in that scene. The kryat dragon call change was also unnecessary and very comedic and if you have heard the new sound of it it would have you laughing to tears in disgust. I totally hate for George to change these wonderful classic film into something very awful. I mean he should go back and change the 2nd Death Star in ROTJ into a completed CGI look of the Death Star and this would have made it better, don't you agree? I also wish GL would change the scene in the Cantina where Han and Greedo were having a discussion back to where Han shoots and Greedo dies and that's the way it should be cause Han is a scoundrel not a defender.  He did however made a good change like covering the Wampa's piece of arm pole that had been exposed for over 30 years which looked a little fake with a cgi arm. So all on all I think the SW Trilogy on Blu-ray will somewhat have me buying despite some of these absurd changes just for the brilliant picture to these films. So that's all I have to say and hopefully GL will change and put the unaltered versions of the original Star Wars onto Blu-ray soon. I know a lot of us are disappointed about these changes but it's GL's movies and he can do what he wants to them. But when most of you are protesting it by not buying his movies then it will give George an idea and give us what we really want and that's the original theatrical versions and maybe the 1997 SE edition too.
B002IYEQR4|4.0|Greatly improved version of the movie. It feels more like the graphic novel now. For fans of the original novel, this is a welcome addition. The film is not the greatest adaption, but it's not the disaster most people think. If you can find it buy it.
0316098337|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I thought it sounded too depressing to read.  I was so wrong.  Yes, I cried in parts, but it was more a book of discovery than a book of horror.

Eat veggies and not fake meats and cheeses. Then you most likely will live to be a fit, trim, healthy ONE HUNDRED! Now doesn't that seem like a better deal?

1439133948|4.0|Like many people I've been eagerly awaiting my next exposure to the over-achieving, hero (and I don't use the term lightly) Miles.  Bujold has written her usual tightly crafted story, and while I wish it were longer, I was drawn in and enjoyed it.  Her ending reminded me that life never quite works out as we like and all to often, the relaxed highs are followed by desperate lows and we should cherish each moment and the people around us every day for everything ends.  I am not usually  affected on a emotional level by books, but this one got to me.  Get it, read it and enjoy it. Hopefully Miles and company will be back to liven up our spare time soon and often.

0307454541|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first book in the Millennium trilogy, delivered to in its entirety by the Swedish writer Stieg Larsson just before his death.  The series has sold more than 27 million copies and is a global phenomenon, so most people now will come to it or ignore it based on word of mouth or reputation.<br /><br />The book begins with a short prologue in which an 82 year-old man has called a retired policeman to tell him that yet another flower has been delivered on his birthday.  The flowers have apparently been sent every year on the man's birthday for almost forty years, since an unsolved crime occurred.  This prologue is very cryptic, but will become a major clue in the book, and even spoil the climax for some who take a moment to consider the implications of the flowers once it is expanded upon later in the book.<br /><br />Next we meet our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who specializes in outing corporate malfeasance.  When we meet him, he has just been convicted of libel against a corporate titan and sentenced to three months in jail.  As Blomkvist mopes about what to do about his magazine, Millennium, after the loss of credibility the conviction has brought, he is called to a remote town by a former corporate titan, the birthday boy from the prologue, to solve the ancient crime.<br /><br />Parallel to this, we meet Lisbeth Salander, the `girl with the dragon tattoo'.  She is a young, troubled woman, who is nonetheless a brilliant researcher for a security firm.  She is good at digging dirt on people, though she is so mysterious no one knows how she does it.  Naturally, she eventually teams up with Blomkvist to help him solve the crime.  And of course, as in any good thriller, they end up finding more than they had bargained for.<br /><br />I think anyone who loves a good thriller will love this book.  It's a little different from a thriller like DaVinci Code in that it's evident it's written by a European.  What I mean by that is Larsson is more concerned about setting up the story and building his characters than an author like Dan Brown, who does very little set-up and feels the need to end every chapter with a cliffhanger.  Larsson's approach might try the patience of some readers, but I thought it made for a deeper and more satisfying read.  And remember that this is a trilogy... by the middle of the second book, you'll be glad of Larsson's care for his characters.  This is a thriller with a brain and a heart.<br /><br />The story itself is filled with intrigue: corporate warfare, technological espionage, sadism, rape... you name it.  (This book is probably not suitable for anyone under 16.)  Since Larsson was a journalist with a focus on extremist groups, it's not surprising that news and journalism gets a heavy treatment, and that there's also a Nazi sub-plot.  Speaking of sub-plots, there are lots of those too, and a dizzying amount of POV changes, but none of that really detracts from the experience.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good thriller, well worth the time.  Keep in mind though, if you decide to read this, you'll want to read the rest of the trilogy.about setting up the story and building his characters than an author like Dan Brown, who does very little set-up and feels the need to end every chapter with a cliffhanger.

0385342047|1.0|I was annoyed by this book. Becky doesn't appear to have grown or developed as a character since I first met her in \\"Confessions.\\"    My problems with this book ****SPOILERS******    1) Lying to parents  2) Lying to Luke. He STILL doesn't know how Elinor helped Becky out.  3) Her obsession with another baby. Why? Another accessory?  4) Despite the title, Becky still doesn't realize she is truly addicted to shopping.  5) Ho-hum. Off to LA. Haven't we done the \\"across the pond is a new experience for Becky\\" plotline before?    I think the author is DONE with this series. Please, end it now.
B003QCCS36|4.0|This is the first LaMontagne music I've purchased. One song is played a lot on AOR so I was familiar with Beg Steal or Borrow and, therefore, his soft drawl and the pedal steel style guitar. He was the opening act to David Gray, so I figured we couldn't go far wrong. His stage set was sufficiently interesting that it prompted me to check out his CDs.  He was more country than I'd expected and there was one song in particular that I enjoyed as it had a banjo accompaniment. And it is this song that I've played most repeatedly. In fact, I did so as I drove up to Santa Rosa for a \\"second\\" date with Andrea last month. It had a line in it that I knew I wanted to share with her but I couldn't remember the name of the singer he sounded like (I needed a reference for her in case she wasn't familiar with him)! I ended up likening him to Dan Fogelberg.  And the line? \\"What's the use of stacking on every failure another stone, til you find you've spent your whole damn life building walls\\".  That so sums up my romantic life, it kills me. I'm playing it repeatedly still; and tearing down my wall (but it didn't get me a third date with Andrea!)  Highly recommend the CD for those who enjoy lyrical insight and laid back singing with soft rock country guitar.

B003F3NDOE|5.0|I've been watching Ugly Betty from the start of Season 1, and have barely missed an episode.  The story lines have been so engaging, the costumes so outlandish, the moments so tender and sweet. The characters are all at their best in Season 4 - Marc and Amanda, Wilhelmina, Hilda.  What I love most about this final season is how the characters have grown up and developed over the last four years and how unlikely friendships have been formed - Amanda and Betty for example.  Also, in Season 1, a romantic relationship between Daniel and Betty would have been unthinkable, but as Daniel has matured over the years, and Betty's confidence has grown and she's become more comfortable with herself, it was completely believable when the season finale hinted at the possibility of a Daniel-Betty relationship.  In other ways, the season finale was just right, it tied everything up well and gave each character the future they deserve. I couldn't have asked for a more satisfying conclusion to this fabulous TV show! Bravo!
0060853980|5.0|Really this book is way beyond five stars. It sends up the Apocalypse, The Omen and even provides an alternative explanation of the expulsion from the Garden of Eden. With a demon named A J Crowley and an Angel who keeps an Antique and Rare Book Shop all you need is an 11 year old Anti-Christ who, due to a bungle by the Chattering Order of Sisters at his birth is raised in an ordinary family without the Satanic influence Hell kept sending the wrong child, a Hellhound that looks like your average \\"Pavement Special\\" and develops a taste for mortality, chasing frisbees and rabbits and ... Let's just say several 'ineffable' plans get derailed as a result.<br /><br />Let's not forget an updated set of Horsemen from the Apolcalypse and their alter-egos the \\"Other\\" Four Bikers ... Or the meeting in the Motorway Cafe \\"Which Chapter are you?\\" Answer: \\"Revelations 6...\\"<br /><br />As someone else has said, don't read this in bed - unless you live alone. Don't even consider reading it on a train during your commute...<br /><br />Pratchett and Gaiman have pulled off one of the master strokes in this genre and created something that crosses genres and creates one all its own. When I have recovered from the aching ribs I will read it again, and probably again and again when I need the laugh. I heartily commend it for its irreverence to all manner of beliefs and even the sciences. Imagine a nuclear power station pouring out electricity - without anything at all inside its reactors ...<br /><br />Er, yes. No more spoilers...
0061433055|5.0|I Shall Wear Midnight (2010) is the fourth Fantasy novel in the Tiffany Aching series, following [[ASIN:0060890339 Wintersmith]].  The initial volume in the series is [[ASIN:0060012382 The Wee Free Men]].    In the previous volume, Tiffany danced with the Wintersmith.  The Nac Mac Feegles trained Roland as a Hero and he rescued Summer from the underworld.  Then Tiffany kissed the Wintersmith.    In this novel, Tiffany Aching is the witch of the Chalk steading.  She is young and idealistic.  Moreover, she swings a mean frying pan.    Roland de Chumsfanleigh is the son of the Baron.  His old man is highly respected and well liked in the Chalk.  At one time, he and Tiffany had thought that they would be married, but they learned better.    Jenny is the kelda of the local Nac Mac Feegles or, as they are also known, the Wee Free Men.  Naturally, Jenny is the mate of Rob Anybody, the clan chief.    Letitia Keepsake is betrothed to Roland.  She is a very weepy girl with a wicked mother.    Amber Petty is a very young woman with a tailor boyfriend and a violent father.  She is pregnant by her boyfriend and her father is angry.    In this story, Tiffany is visiting the annual scouring fair.  She sees many people that she has met while witching and, of course, they recall her.  OTOH, the towed broom and the pointed hat are a dead giveaway.    Tiffany is moving toward the cheese roll.  She is not competing in the roll this year, for a witch can neither win nor lose without causing comments.  But she notices Horace in the group rolling down the hill.    Horace is a strange cheese wheel.  She had made him much like her other cheeses, but he was the only one that ate mice and -- if not staked -- other cheeses.  He is rolling down the hill and then back up it while bumping other cheeses and causing pandemonium.    Tiffany takes Horace and sticks him in her bag.  She calls for Rob to show himself and finds him sitting on her shoulder.  He says that Jenny wanted him to find her andsays that she hasn't been to the mound in two weeks.    Tiffany mentions that she has much to do and suggests that he should not take Horace out again in public.  She reminds him that Horace gets excited.  She also tells him that she is doing well, but is now needed to bandage some of the boisterous crowd.    Then a coach rolls up and Roland steps out.  From inside the coach, an unpleasant voice tells him that he should have waited for the footman to open the door, but he hurries into the crowd.  He immediately asks about the commotion.    Tiffany explains the situation and he responds with a compliment.  Then Letitia appears and suggests that they get going before her mother gets more vexed.  The coach drives off to the castle.    After returning home, Tiffany is awakened with bad news.  Mr. Petty has beaten his daughter and caused Amber to miscarriage.  The terrified Mrs. Petty ran to the village pub and spread the news.  Now the people are angry and coming to get the malefactor.    Tiffany goes to the Petty farm, where she drags Mr. Petty from his bed and down the stairs.  As he is puking on the kitchen floor, she advises him to pack and run away.  The mob enters the farmyard and Mr. Petty runs out the back.    Tiffany takes Amber to the Nac Mac Feegle mound and puts her in the care of Jenny.  The kelda performs some soothings and Amber calms down.  But she definitely doesn't want to go home again.    This tale has Tiffany confronted by the Cunning Man.  He is no longer corporate, so he possesses other people.  He hates witches with an extreme passion and his hatred is contagious.  Now he is stalking Tiffany.    Tiffany also meets Preston, a young man with insight.  Unfortunately, this is the last volume in the series, unless fans can convince the author to write more about Tiffany.  Read and enjoy!    Highly recommended for Pratchett fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of witch magic, troublemaking ghosts, and brave young women.    -Arthur W. Jordin
B003VJTGLQ|3.0|While I feel the blu-ray transfer is better than the DVD it still is not film quality. There is a lot of edge enhancement done to people (observe the scene in which Lester's boss has his 1st talk to him...there is a white halo all the way around his body) and objects which says that this is not a true HD transfer but more than likely an up-convert from the DVD transfer. The image is soft and not in a \\"cinematographers choice\\" kind of way but in a pixelated way. Paramount continues to release sub-par blu-rays until people complain, than release corrected versions (Gladiator being a perfect example). Worth getting? For a slightly better picture: yes. But no extra extras (a direct port of the DVD which means bonus material that is now nearly 10 years old) is a let down for their \\"flagship\\" Sapphire Collection. This movie deserves a much better transfer and treatment overall. Released 1 year after it's anniversary you would have thought Paramount would have done some special for a film that brought them home a few Oscars and helped solidify Dreamworks as a major studio player.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|My Name is Khan is based on a man who has autism, is Muslim, and living in the United States after the 9/11 attack.  It was heart-warming and very moving.  You have to realize that this isn't just some drama.  It's a movie that reenacts what actually happened to many Muslims after the 9/11 attack.  I still find it hard to believe the cruelty that was bestowed upon them just for their beliefs/race.  For me, this movie was kind of like watching Life is Beautiful.  It gives you a different aspect of what happened during such a devastating time.  You learn to love Khan's character and have such respect for his strives.  I LOVED this movie!!
0312933541|4.0|This is an earlier novel by the author, set during a short period of time in 1966.  It gets into the world of Swiss banks, and missing treasures following World War II.  There is a question about the Czar's Icon, a small piece of art painted on wood of St. George and the Dragon.  A copy, or is it a copy, has come into the hands of a former captain in the West Essex - a man of many skills of survival who fought Chinese in Malaya and was awarded the Military Cross.  Now he is on the run, with various governments interested in obtaining the icon, and intelligence agents from the UK, USA, and USSR joining in the chase.  He finds himself matching wits with a deadly KGB major.  People around him die.  He discovers the secret of the icon, and devises plans of his own regarding the KGB major.<br /><br />The story seems to start out a bit slow, but the action picks up as the story progresses.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|This album has most of George Harrison's greatest hits.  It is a good, solid album.
B003JSSPSY|3.0|I find myself deeply ambivalent about this television show. On one hand, it's compulsively watchable --- it's hard to just watch one episode at a time --- but on the other, it is deeply flawed.    While watching the second season, I was reminded of two things. The first thing was a psychological study that showed that when given a test of different skills and then given an opportunity to practice one of those skills some more, Japanese students practiced whatever they performed worst at and Americans studied even more what they were already best at.    Clearly, the makers of Legend of the Seeker are in the American mold. One of the great strengths of the first season was that the show looked enormously good. The biggest positive change in the second season is to look even better. This takes many forms: a vivid Underworld, a truly fabulous dream sequence in one of the early episodes and most spectacularly, turning a Mord-Sith character introduced in the finale of season one into a regular. Named Cara Mason and played by Tabrett Bethell, this character ups the visual appeal of the cast to ridiculous heights. In some scenes, I worried that the pixels in my television would collectively sigh and slide off the screen.    That said, I can't imagine anyone watching the first season having the reaction, \\"The problem with this show is that it's not sexy enough.\\" The weakness of the show, rather, is the writing. In the first season, it was erratic. This time I suspect the episodes were farmed out to different writing teams who wrote in isolation from each other and were each given a weekend to finish their work. Each episode has its own little arc that had little to do with the hero's main quest. This makes episodes predictable and characters strange: they'd have different abilities in different episodes, if not different personalities.  Indeed, the real Wizard's First Rule is that a wizard's abilities will change to fit the needs of the plot. So sometimes Zedd can raise thedead or transport people distances and other times acts like an extra just watching filming. You'll find yourself asking, over and over, \\"Why doesn't he cast that spell that he cast last episode? That would solve this problem real quick.\\"    This was a problem in the first season but it gets worse. Some of the shifts between episodes are downright annoying. In one, we're introduced to (a) another reality in which time passes at a different speed, (b) another legitimate Seeker [!] and (c) new powers of Richard's that you'd think would have been obvious earlier, especially to Zedd. And none of these dramatic twists amounts to much.     And the characters basically dither around until episode sixteen or so and then things finally start happening. (You know things are on the uptick when the episodes begin `Previously seen on Legend of the Seeker': the episode will be connected to a larger story.) And to be fair, the writers seem vaguely aware of these problems: one minor character complains that Zedd the wizard's powers are `erratic' and when Richard has to work with a villain and wants to stop to help some locals, the villain ridicules him for his `side quests'.     But what's really painful the second season is the dialogue. It's bad. Really bad. It's a succession of things like, \\"Run!\\", \\"You'll never get away with this!\\" and \\"Your faith in your friends will be your downfall, Luke Skywalker.\\"    Then there's this conversation that they have at the beginning of almost every episode. The show opens with a character magically cursed or kidnapped. Next:    Someone: What are we going to do?  Richard (always Richard): We can't just leave them to die.  Someone: But what about our main quest? We don't have time to save them.  Richard: We must save them!   Someone else: We might not have time to save them anyway because __________.  Richard and others: Then we must hurry!    This is so utterly mindless that character development essentially ceases. If you know what Richard, Kahlan and Zedd were like at the end of season one, you know what they are like at the end of season two. They have in effect become minor characters in their own show. This is hardest to watch with Kahlan. In season one, Bridget Regan's performance held everything together, inoculating the show against the potential to degenerate into kitsch. In season two, her lines are purely functional and predictable. The worst: there's one scene in which she describes to a god the origins of the universe. Call me a silly but a god would know that story better than Kahlan.     Cara, the screenwriters' new toy, suffers the least from bad dialogue, mainly because she doesn't say that much. Instead, Tabrett Bethell smolders any incredible range of emotions. But even in her case, the screenwriters blow it. When the main two characters of a band of heroes are madly in love with each other but can't consummate their relationship, adding to the mix one of the most overtly eroticized characters in the history of television who is, to boot, utterly devoted to one of the lovers would, you might think, set off some serious fireworks. Not really.    So the second thing this season reminded me of: the line from _On the Waterfront_: \\"I could have been a contender.\\" This show has so many things going for it. Strong actors, intriguing relationships amongst the characters, vivid sets and landscapes, engaging costumes, a lot of energy, a credible special effects budget, etc. Yet by disregarding the importance of a good story, the makers of the show render themselves mediocre. The show is fun to watch -- I actually have a lot of affection for it and am severely disappointed that it was canceled  --  but it could have changed television. It could have been one of those shows that everyone talked about, been imitated by countless other shows, got tv executives to think about their audience and marketing in a different light. Instead, we're left hoping that the actors will be given opportunities in the future so that we might still be able to watch them.    By the way, if anyone knows a good essay or book on how shows like this are written, please drop me a recommendation in the comment section. My gut feeling is that there is just so much pressure to write these shows quickly that a very distinctive and dysfunctional system has been developed, but I'm only guessing based on the final product.
B00337KM2S|2.0|A derivative and sentimentalized version of Camus' The Stranger.  Acting, direction, and cinematography are all very good.  Probably the best performance of which George Clooney is capable.  Clooney's character is a highly successful executive leading a rootless life devoid of meaningful human contact, whose job is to inflict pain in the form of job termination, and whose other human contacts are a series of commercial transactions or acts of shallow self-gratification.  Like the anonymous protagonist of The Stranger, Clooney's character is a counter-example of a meaningful life should be.  In some ways, this is a fairly clever construction, using some of the romantic comedy conventions in a mildly subsersive manner.  Unlike The Stranger, where Camus remorsely drives the protagonist's lack of humanity to its logical conclusion with murder and execution, Up in The Air flinches by punishing Clooney's character for attempting to break out of his cul de sac.  This implies a kind of cosmic justice that is irrelevant to this theme.

If the guy you're interested doesn't call you back or doesn't want to sleep with you, duh!  But this author is way too ethnocentric.  He's coming from a typical aggressive American kind of attitude that is absolutely not the way that ALL men are.  What if the guy you like is from India, (or France, or Germany or...) do you think he'll behave in the exact predictable way that this author would?  Hardly- he completely denies that men are different, have different emotional needs, different backgrounds, morals and values.  All men do not behave in exactly the same predictable ways.  Give me a break Greg!

The foreword simply contains the producers' reason as to why they don't explain (or know) the details to all of the show's mysteries.    The first few pages are perfect examples of what the user Tyrannosauron describes in his review, particularly poor editing and odd design.      The writing is decent but not particularly enlightening.    That being said, it's nice to have all of the information summarized in a convenient manner.

He gives them the surname \\"Fossils\\" due to his penchant for paleontology. Uncle Matthew goes off on another of his many, lengthy adventures leaving the girls in the care of his niece Sylvia (AKA \\"Garnie\\" or Guardian to the girls)and Nana (Sylvia's nurse when she was a child).<br />The women are forced to open the large London home to an interesting group of borders in order to make ends meet in Matthew's absence. The girls are also sent to dancing school in the hopes of honing some marketable skills. The three girls have very different aspirations (Pauline-acting, Petrova-aviation, and Posy-ballet) but they make a pact to put themselves in the history books and help their Garnie and Nana support the household.<br /><br />What I liked --<br />-The film is very well done with a cast of memorable characters and witty dialogue.<br />-I also found that it communicated good life lessons. For example, Pauline chooses to become a spoiled prima donna while acting in a play and the director demotes her to understudy.<br />-The film also puts an emphasis on the values of hard work and family.<br />-A happy ending.<br /><br />What I did not like --<br />It was such a cute movie that it is really hard to pick it apart and find something not likable.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this film to any fans of family friendly films or BBC dramas.
B003UMW68Y|4.0|[[ASIN:B003UMW68Y Nightmare Before Christmas [Blu-ray]]]<br />Since there are a number of reviews listed on previous releases of this movie which describe the storyline of The Nightmare Before Christmas, I will just mention that I saw it when it was originally released in the movie theaters and have been a fan ever since. After being unable to find out sufficient details about the technical specs of this 2010 release on the Amazon and Disney websites, I decided to find out the information by visiting a \\"Big Box\\" store so that I could physically look at the Blu-ray/DVD cover. This version contains one Blu-ray disk and one DVD disk. The Blu-ray specs listed on the box are 1080p, with a 1:66:1 aspect ratio. The DVD specs are shown as \\"original theatrical format\\" with a 1:66:1 aspect ratio. If you do not already own a Blu-ray player, this version will work best.<br /><br />After considering this information, I decided to order the Blu-ray + Digital (2008 release) from Amazon since I did not have any use for another standard DVD in my collection, and the Blu-ray disk has the same aspect ratio of 1:66:1. [[ASIN:B001AIRUP4 The Nightmare Before Christmas [Blu-ray] + Digital Copy]] The picture quality on this Blu-ray shows a vast improvement over the DVD Special Edition released in 2000.<br /><br />For anyone who is a fan of this movie and is considering purchasing a Blu-ray version, I would tell them that it is definitely worth the upgrade.
B00005ABX0|3.0|I am aware that Smiley Smile was a replacement for the much anticepated Smile and had not hit the highest standards that the latter had aimed for.  From where I coming from only Heroes And Villians and Good Vibrations are total winners, to be honest I don't understand any of the other 9 tracks, they just seem so many miles away from earlier (and some later) Beach Boys classics.  Again with Wild Honey, I like the title track and Darlin', the rest, well apart from I Was Made To Love Her, fails to hit the mark.  The bonus tracks don't set the world on fire, overall this is not The Beach Boys I particularly enjoy.
0545265355|1.0|This book \\"The HUNGER GAMES\\" was the most disgusting book I have  ever read. It sounded like something that Marxism would write. The  winner had to kill everbody else to win. This was a waste of time  to read or even to write.
B00456PKG4|3.0|As long as you're aware that you're watching a video game-turned-movie, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Jake Gyllenhaal will never be mistaken for a Persian, but he does just fine in this run-of-the-mill action flick.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|I enjoyed reading, \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\" Especially the segment set in Italy. After that, the book seemed to lose steam. And I never understood exactly what drove her to leave her marriage. The movie gives that back-story. The movie also makes the main character, Elizabeth, a bit less self-involved and therefore more likable. And the romance at the end works better due to editing and strong performances. So...maybe I'm reviewing the movie instead of the book. But my point is: the book was flawed. It started out strong and lost momentum, plus the reader never really gets to understand the main character.<br /><br />On the upside: it did inspire me to travel to India and stay at an ashram. Also inspired me to overeat!
0316098337|5.0|I saw the promos for Room on Amazon and read some of the reviews before I downloaded it to my Kindle.  I had never read anything by the author, and knew only what I had seen.  When I began reading Room, however, I was completely awestruck by what Emma Donoghue accomplished in this little novel.  As an English teacher, I can say that one of the most difficult elements in fiction to carry off well is narrative voice.  Read Pride and Prejudice and listen to the variances in the characters' diction and syntax;  these variations tell you exactly what Miss Austen thought of those characters.  Miss Donoghue has created a distinct and (almost entirely) consistent voice in this novel's five-year-old narrator.  In Room, Jack is a child of such scope and yet such limitation that his character is a constant paradox.  He is both intellectually gifted and naturally perceptive, and yet due to the circumstances of his birth and life so far, he is also often incredibly naive about life outside of the room he lives in. Some reviewers have found these contradictions in his \\"voice\\" off-putting, but I found them to be completely believable, especially if one considers that his mother was only nineteen at the time of her abduction, and probably did not have an extremely well-developed personal voice herself.  In the novel, she often struggles with how to explain things to Jack, so the idiosyncrasies in his speech did not bother me.    What I did wish for in this novel was more development of the character of Ma, Jack's heroic mother.  I particularly wanted to better understand her actions after their liberation, as I sometimes found them somewhat inconsistent with the incredible strength she exhibits during their captivity.  I also found the character of Jack's grandmother rather lacking in development.  Her lack of empathy was, for me, the most off-putting and irritating part of the novel.  Really, I just wanted to smack her upside the head.    All that being said, this is a book I willnever forget.  It has truly made me see the world through different eyes.  I look at the guest room in my own home and consider what it would be like to have such a small space be the world.  I look at my own grandson, who is six, and thank God that he is safe and loved and protected (and that I don't have to keep him as well-entertained as Ma has managed with Jack for all those years).  It's not often a book comes along that changes the reader in such a profound way, but Room is just such a book.  Read it and prepare to have your world changed.

0316098337|5.0|Skip all the reviews of ROOM by Emma Donoghue and just click the BUY button, because this is a book you will NOT regret purchasing.    ROOM's most unique attribute, in my view, is a plot that is totally unlike anything I've ever read before. Written from the viewpoint of a 5 year old boy, whose innocence and lack of world experience enables him to feel loved and happy in a totally scary and traumatic environment. Jack and his Ma are forcibly locked in an 11 x 11 room, but since that room is all he has ever known, it is his happy, secure world. Jack's Ma hatches a plot to escape that requires 5 year old Jack to be \\"scave\\" - a \\"word sandwich\\" which means scared plus brave.    Not since James Frey's A MILLION LITTLE PIECES have I read a book with such a unique viewpoint and told in such an deeply personal, moving level. ROOM is a totally original piece of fiction that holds onto your heart from the first paragraph to the last -- and well after.    I rarely say this in a review. BUY THIS BOOK.
0316077054|4.0|I really enjoyed Beautiful Creatures, and had huge expectation for Beautiful Darkness. There were a few things that I loved and a thing or two that I didn't. It picks right up where the last book ended. Lena and Ethan are still star crossed lovers that can't be together for obvious reasons. Lena is a Castor and Ethan isn't. I didn't feel that the characters developed as much as I would like. Lena seems to be come childlike and lost into a pit of darkness, because all that she can feel is the darkness. Ethan tries to assure her that it will passed. Instead a huge wedge is formed between them and their relationship seems to slowly crumble. This play a great part in the actions of Lena and Ethan. Link and Ridley returns and they bring in a comedic effect to the book and also both developed a lot. The Sisters, Amma, and Marian the Librarian return. Along with plenty of new characters, such as Liv, who is fantastic. There were a few characters that weren't developed as I hoped.<br />The plot of Beautiful Darkness was full of so much information. A few times, I felt a little overwhelmed with all the information that came at one time and also the pacing was all over the place. I felt that parts of it could have been shortened, because it was so slow at times. It felt like it could have been simplified. I did like how original it was. I love the Castor world and how unique it is. I honestly can't compare it to any book. Stohl and Garcia are stunning writers. It blends so well together. I am sure that you would love this book, if you liked Beautiful Creatures. I enjoyed it despite my complaints.
B001F7EZ9Y|2.0|I'm a pretty big AC-DC fan.  I wouldn't call them my top group, but I do own 10 albums by them and 3 DVDs.  I have to say this is the least favorite of the 10 I own.  I can't really pick any song I like other than maybe Rock N' Roll Train.  Maybe I haven't given it enough time, but I find it hard to even remember most of the songs.  I have over 8000 songs in my music collection.  This CD is so full of forgettable tunes it gets little air play.  You might say with such a large collection it's not fair to rate this based on how often I want to play it, but other recent release purchases by artists as varied as Ozzie or Meat Loaf get played and re-played as well as older AC-DC albums I've had for years.  If I was to do an AC-DC's geatest hits CD choosing from the 10 albums I own, I'm not sure anything from this album would even make the cut.  If you're a big fan and have the money to spend, add it to your collection.  If you're a casual or new fan, don't judge the group by this offering.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Very happy with the CD and how it arrived. The CD plays fine with no skips!
B003L77TZI|3.0|Ok so I'll just review every song and make it sweet and simple :)    1) Teenage Dream: I love this song, I really like the lyrics and Katy actually sings alright in this song. 8/10     2) Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.): I hate this song, the lyrics are really stupid and it's just a pointless song in general. 1/10     3) California Gurls: Cute song but nothing special. And snoop dogg doesn't really make this song special either. 7/10 *BTW I really hate the music vid for this song...it doesn't relate to california AT ALL...whatever.     4) Firework: Simple song, nothing special about it unfornately. I think if she put more effort into this song then it could be good. 5/10    5) Peacock: Trashy lyrics but this song manages to stay in my head all day so I guess it doesn't suck THAT bad....6/10     6) Circle The Drain: I really like this song even though I think it's kinda mean to her ex. I like the rock influences in this song too. 9/10     7) The One That Got Away: This song kinda reminds me of Teenage Dream even though it isn't as good or as memorable as Teenage Dream. 7/10    8) E.T.: This song is so weird, a part of me likes this song and another part of me is like WTF is this crap. 6/10     9) Who Am I Living For: Everything about this song is awesome to me except for Katy's horrible singing. Seriously, she sounded like a dying animal when she tried to sing the high notes. Maybe she should quit smoking. 8.5/10    10) Pearl: This song could be good, but something bugs me about this song and I'm not sure what it is. All I know is that it sounds corny and I don't like it. 5.5/10    11) Hummingbird Heartbeat: \\"I feel like I'm losing my virginty\\"....really katy? This is not a song that you want to play around people. Idk why but I hate that starting verse. It murders the song...But the rest is ok. 5/10    12) Not Like The Movies: This song is so boring, it might be a good thing though...maybe I can listen to it when I'm trying to get myself to sleep? The lyrics are cute but that's the only good thing about this song. 4/10     SUMMARY: The album is decent but I don't like how this album is competely different than her \\"One Of The Boys\\" album. I liked how the last album had guitars and stuff in it, while this one is all pop and mindless lyrics. I don't get how people like this album better?

B0034G4P7G|5.0|\\"Social Network\\" is a riveting movie, a Hollywood version of the true story of a smart but struggling Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) , and the crafty, determined ego that drives him to win Facebook fame and billions of dollars.  \\"Social Network\\" engrosses from the get-go, it is a fascinating look at privileged college students that grew up with the computer and  Internet.  Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest American billionaire, because he became the entrepreneur who co-founded the social networking site Facebook.  The story shows Zuckerberg, along with fellow classmates Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzello), and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield),  starting Facebook.  In its infancy was just a project showing pictures of college girls rated for \\"hotness\\" -by downloading college campus photos, he caused a security breach at Harvard and one of many times Zuckerberg is pulled in front of authorities.  Zuckerberg remains unfazed and sticks to developing and turning Facebook into a mega power and money phenomenon.  One put-off is that the movie has a arrogance or chill in its treatment of women.  There is a feeling that all the men are misogynist, although Zuckerberg seems to have a lasting crush on Erica Allbright (Rooney Mara).  He messes up his chances with crass and arrogant remarks on a date.  He is just socially inept, but a genius on the computer.<br /><br />As things evolve and get complicated, more people are interested in Facebook,  Enter Justin Timberlake, who plays Sean Parker, the founder of Napster.  He meets with and impresses  Mark Zuckerberg as he validates all it can be.  This is the start of conflict and stress for the CFO, Eduardo Saverin.<br /><br />Both Eisenberg and Timberlake's  performances are spot-on, fascinating and wonderful to watch.  All the cast does an excellent job  with well-developed characters, a smart script and recent historical relevance.  It has all the human emotions of greed, obsession, entitlement, and unrequited love.  There are legal battles on intellectual property, who is back-stabbing who, and all  punctuated by Eisenberg's fantastic acting, delivery of complicated emotions with exceptional originality..<br /><br />The drama is interesting, the pace of the movie is fast and smart.  A very enjoyable drama as well as a peek into the web generation's way of life.There are legal battles on intellectual property, who is back-stabbing who, and all  punctuated by Eisenberg's fantastic acting, delivery of complicated emotions with exceptional originality..

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|1) One Of The Boys: I love this song! I think that this song was the perfect song to start the album off. 9.5/10     2) I Kissed A Girl: This song gets a lot of critizism because of the lyrics but it's a good pop song. And if you don't like the lyrics then don't listen to the song, it's that simple. I kinda like the background music to this song too. 7.5/10    3) Waking Up In Vegas: This song is the perfect \\"going out to party\\" song. 7/10    4) Thinking Of You: I love the lyrics of this song, even though I don't like how it's about her cheating on her boyfriend with another guy. 7.5/10    5) Mannequin: Very cutesy song, not her best work though. 6/10     6) Ur So Gay: Everyone seems to hate this song because it's supposetly \\"anti-gay\\" or whatever but I like it a lot. And Katy Perry isn't anti gay because she hangs out with Perez Hilton (who is 100% GAY). 8/10    7) Hot N' Cold: This song is probably the most pop-ish song out of all the songs on this album. OK song in my opinion. 6/10    8) If You Can Afford Me: The lyrics are good and bad at the same time but her singing voice is decent on this song, which is a plus. 7/10    9) Lost: I'm not a big fan of this song. The music isn't my favorite. 3/10    10) Self Inflicted: The music in this song overpowers katy's voice. But it's a decent song anyway. 6.5/10    11) I'm Still Breathing: One of my favorites, it's a calming and peaceful song and the lyrics are awesome. 9.5/10    12) Fingerprints: This song reminds me of self inflicted, but it's not as good. And it's too poppy and Kelly Clarkston sounding to me. 5/10     SUMMARY: Overall this is a really good pop/rock album. The music is pretty good and her lyrics are decent as well. What she really needs to work on is her singing voice. She sounds fine on the album, but look on youtube to see her sing live...it's not a good thing. If she could just get some singing lessons, then I think that she will be really successful.   EDIT: Her new album \\"Teenage Dream\\" is pretty much all bubblegum pop and hardly any guitars! :( Disappointing.   Katy, bubblegum pop isn't your thing. Leave that to Britney Spears ;)    SONGS TO DOWNLOAD   -One Of The Boys    -I Kissed A Girl  -Thinking Of You   -Ur So Gay   -If You Can Afford Me   -Self Inflicted   -I'm Still Breathing

B001AQO400|1.0|Just to be clear, this is not a review of this item itself, it is a review of the movie. I bought the dvd of this movie based on reviews and awards but never having seen it. I was disgusted by the pornography in this movie let alone the slowest most boring plot known to mankind. If you've seen this movie and liked it, well what can I say...but if you haven't seen it, don't buy it until you rent it first if this review hasn't turned you off. I couldn't in good conscience give my copy to anyone else so I destroyed it and threw it away. A waste of 7 bucks, but at least I could sleep at night knowing I didn't pass the smut on to someone else.

B002L5UTPS|3.0|Considering the price, this product doesn't get the play time I was hoping it would.  Perhaps that is due to the fact that the ramps come on and off.  My boys are young, two and four.  Maybe this will become a hit later.  It takes up a lot of room for something that isn't really being played with.  I bought it because I loved the idea of the wooden toys, and I wanted something that required thinking and not just pushing buttons to make noise.  We have a lot of wooden train tracks and a train table.  I sometimes set this up in place of the tracks on the table and put the cars out... They don't really play with it.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />The original of THE KARATE KID has been on Cable so many times that it is virtually impossible not to have seen it unless you've consciously avoided it. This is a light movie that transcends itself.<br /><br />It's the archetypal story of the New Kid, Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio). Daniel's single mother finds new opportunities in Southern California, and together they move lock, stock and barrel from familiar northern New Jersey to alien Reseda, California. Despite the sunshine and palm trees, California is dark and menacing for Daniel. He meets Ali (Elisabeth Shue), the Popular Girl, who takes quite a shine to him, despite the fact that her ex-boyfriend Johnny (Billy Zabka) is still asserting his \\"proprietary rights\\" over her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Johnny is the head of a gang of karate thugs, the Cobra Kai, who are being taught a debased form of Budo by their irrational Sensei. Johnny decides that Daniel is an acceptable surrogate for a punching bag, and he and his friends begin tormenting Daniel on a constant basis.<br /><br />There's an element of class warfare here. Johnny and the Cobra Kai (and Ali) are all affluent and spoiled, while Daniel is hardscrabble, from the wrong side of the tracks. Daniel's mother (Randee Heller) is an adorable New York Yenta Momma who babies him shamelessly.<br /><br />After a particularly vicious beating, Daniel is taken under the wing of Mr. Miyagi (Pat Noriyuki Morita), a bandy-legged elderly Nisei with a wisp of a beard, who decides to initiate Daniel as a disciple of Empty Hand Combat. Daniel is to fight in the Juniors Tournament against the Cobra Kai.<br /><br />I say  \\"initiate\\" and \\"disciple\\" rather than \\"teach\\" and \\"student\\" because Miyagi-san is less interested in showing Daniel-san how to kick and punch than how to live comfortably inside his own skin. The two develop a filial bond, which is cemented forever when Daniel comes to realize that Mr. Miyagi is a Medal of Honor winner of the famed all-Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team, who tragically lost his wife and newborn child to complications arising from the birth while both were interned at Manzanar Relocation Camp (during the shameful displacement of Japanese-Americans following Pearl Harbor).<br /><br />In what has become an iconic sequence, Mr. Miyagi imparts muscle memory to Daniel by making him paint his extensive fence and his big house, sand his vast deck, and wax his seven cars (\\"Wax on! Wax off!\\"). Daniel does so, blindly, until he is heartily sick of it all, when the real training begins.<br /><br />One reason that THE KARATE KID is so well-remembered is that the acting is truly effortless. Long Island native Ralph Macchio as the very \\"New Yawk\\" Daniel has a constantly running mouth. He's immature, particularly at the beginning, when everything seems to be a joke. Belieing his Brooklynesque stereotype, he is much given to complaining, sniveling and crying. Later, after he becomes more adept, his retreats into this behavior become a little irritating. But at least he doesn't suddenly become James Bond.<br /><br />Elisabeth Shue is young and cute as Ali, the girlfriend we all wanted in High School. Neither she nor Daniel fall impossibly Hollywood-style in love with each other, which keeps the character realistic.<br /><br />This became Pat Morita's signature role. One of a handful of Far Eastern American actors, Morita played Arnold on HAPPY DAYS for a number of seasons, and can be found gracing the cast of every more recent film on the Pacific War, as well as M*A*S*H, KUNG FU, and other TV series. Morita is wonderful as Miyagi, the sage. He not only teaches Daniel how to fight, he teaches him self-respect and true respect for others. From his opening scene, where he teaches Daniel how to capture a fly with chopsticks, his entire demeanor is that of the Zen Elder. Fortunately, Morita knows how to laugh at himself and his character, and so his wisdom is leavened with whimsy:<br /><br/>Daniel: \\"What belt do you have?\\"<br />Miyagi: \\"J.C. Penney canvas.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|I really enjoyed the 1984 Ralph Macchio/Pat Morita version of THE KARATE KID, so I have to admit I was prejudiced against this remake, expecting that it would be, like most remakes, a fair imitation at best. And having now seen this version, I still like the original better, though Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan both turn in fine performances as student and teacher.<br /><br />This KARATE KID borrows very heavily from the original. The storylines are nearly identical and much of the dialogue is shared. In this version, young Dre (Smith) is an American boy living in China where his mother has been corporately transferred. As the new kid and as a foreigner he runs afoul of the local martial arts thugs who are being taught a debased form of Empty Hand Combat (Kung Fu rather than Karate) by their irrationally hostile teacher.<br /><br />After a particularly savage beating, he is taken under the wing of Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), who proceeds to teach him Kung Fu in order to compete against the thugs in the Juniors Tournament.<br /><br />Mr. Han shares much with Mr. Miyagi of the original film. In a particularly funny sequence he is targeting a fly with chopsticks in his hand, only to unexpectedly squash the fly flat with a swatter instead.  Han, though, is younger than Miyagi, and lacks the air of sagacity (and humor) which so animated Pat Morita's characterization.<br /><br />For his part, Dre, at age twelve, though younger than Ralph Macchio's Daniel LaRusso, is overall, more mature (despite a tendency to drop his clothes on the floor and watch Sponge Bob Squarepants after school).<br /><br />Unlike the original with it's now-famous \\"Wax on! Wax off!\\" training sessions, most of Dre's early training consists of hanging his jacket up over and over and over again. The problem with this as a muscle memory training technique is that Han doesn't formalize Dre's body movements. The sudden elevation of hanging a coat on a hook into a deadly art form is a bit of a stretch. In order to make up for this contrivance, the film takes us on a visual tour of a beautiful and ancient Chinese Buddhist monastery where Han perfects Dre's fighting skills. Dre, expectedly, wins the tournament.<br /><br />The heart and soul of this version of THE KARATE KID are both far weaker than that of the original film. Although Dre tells Han at one point, \\"I love you,\\" it's only a line in a script. Dre and Han remain only favored student and teacher and never become, as in the original, surrogate son and father. Mr. Han has none of the emotional draw of Mr. Miyagi. Pat Morita tapped into something profound. Jackie Chan is just acting.<br /><br />THE KARATE KID goes to great lengths to show us that the Chinese are just like us here in America with the same compulsion for consumer goods. To an extent, the filmmakers' intent is to build bridges between China and the United States, and that's all to the good.<br /><br />However, the film is badly unbalanced in its depiction of modern China. The United States that Dre and his mother leave (Detroit) is only briefly seen, and is portrayed as nothing but an ugly crumbling slum while everything in China is presented as bright, shiny, new and wonderful, to an extent that made me wonder if THE KARATE KID was funded by the Propaganda Ministry in Beijing.<br /><br />The film utterly ignores the fact that China is the world's largest totalitarian State with an abysmal record of respecting human rights and a history of subjugating and slaughtering ethnic groups like the Tibetans, and even non-Han Chinese.<br /><br />Further, the film studiously ignores the fact that China has become a hideously polluted, freeway-strangled Los Angeles-like megalopolis in many places. More than one friend (of many who have visited China) asked if they showed us the smog. With a national policy of tearing down virtually all its traditional architecture in favor of concrete and rebar, and the paving over of its land forms, China is an ecological disasterzone.<br /><br />I know this is entertainment not documentary, but the All-China cheerleading that marks this film is very close to completely objectionable. Even the end credits are in Chinese (and English). After all, the studio can't lose that bottom line!<br /><br />\\"I don't know what they do to the ice cream, but it's so much better here!\\" Dre's mother says. Yeah, isn't life in a dictatorship just so much better than life in a democracy? Like Dre says, early in the film, \\"I don't like it here, I want to go home.\\"<br /><br />No matter how good this movie is, I'll second that.cheerleading that marks this film is very close to completely objectionable.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|At 9.99 I buy books on Kindle. At 19.99 I go to the library.  We as consumers need to react to the slow creeping of kindle prices. It used to be that older books were sold for less than six bucks. Now, even twenty year old books are 9.99, and new books are priced higher than the hardcovers.  We only have ourselves to blame for this. Show a little discipline, stop paying these inflated prices, and the prices will drop. Keep paying and they'll keep rising. Easy as that.
0316069485|4.0|Michael Connelly? Gotta be my favorite author, but I'm not going to give \\"The Reversal\\" five stars because I never really enjoyed the book. Sure, the tension is there as Harry Bosch teams up with Mickey Haller (you need to find out why Haller is working for the state versus being a defense lawyer so read the book) as a guy who has spent a quarter of a century behind bars for the abduction and killing of a child gets a new trial thanks to numerous appeals to the court system.     I thought Connelly tried to hard in this book. The plot is simple. The trial is put together to re-try the main suspect. The clever defense lawyer for the other side versus Mickey Haller, his ex-wife and Bosch on the other side. My problem is that the plot just chugs along with no real excitement. Will the suspect get a \\"not guilty\\" verdict? Will Haller be able to prosecute this guy? I just had a tough time with the Haller/Bosch/McPherson lineup on the prosecution side and the whole book felt a bit \\"forced.\\" A great deal of the book is set in the courtroom with Bosch scurrying around trying to find people and clues to what the other side may be up to in the trial.     Now, I read the book cover to cover. I always love Connelly's stuff, but I think he's written far better. Wait, I KNOW he's written far better. It's worth your time to read, but go into the book knowing that Connelly is not at his best in this book.

B0043ISH6O|5.0|I'll be honest, one of the reasons I went to see \\"The Social Network\\" was because of this music. Having been a fan of NIN for many, many years now, I wanted to see, or hear, how Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross would approach scoring a movie about the founding of Facebook. Apparently, when Fincher first approached Reznor with the idea of scoring this film, he balked. Ultimately, Reznor and Ross ended up agreeing to score the film and the results are nothing short of spectacular. Many of these songs sound like they would be completely at home on the NIN instrumental album, \\"Ghosts\\", which is appropriate since two of the songs on this release are re-worked versions that first appeared on \\"Ghosts\\". I don't remember thinking at any point during my viewing of \\"The Social Network\\", that a song seemed out of place or a little overly dramatic for a particular scene, as is the case for quite a few films I've seen recently. I would recommend watching \\"The Social Network\\" prior to purchasing this album as I think you, the listener, will have a greater appreciation for the work contained therein.

0399536108|5.0|As I came to do my review I was surprised to see 2 through 4 star reviews. I expected this book to either be loved or totally hated.    For someone starting their entrepreneurial journey and looking for ways to change their standard 9 to 5 method of existence the book offers many insights and will possibly serve as a launching point for someone to get started into a more rewarding life.    For those who already have gone the entrepreneurial route, who have had non \\"standard\\" living, who already have in one way or another challenged the status quo, then this book may be a disappointment.    A few of the things you will find in the book:  * Personal stories of how one can achieve one's desired goal through sheer determination  * Examples of how choices we make have an impact in our present and future  * Ideas on how get started in a \\"non standard\\" and entrepreneurial lifestyle  * Checklist styled tips on specific topics such as how to learn what you would have learned in school at a fraction of the cost through self directed learning  * Tips on finding jobs that scale and that promote freedom instead of of jobs that have a direct relation between hours worked and money earned
B003097ABA|4.0|The Cars are definetly one of America's better known pop bands. Formed in 1976   by Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr their 'tour de force' of songwriting talents  continued until 1988. Just for the record, after Elektra Records let them sign  on the dotted line, and spent tons of money on the A&R section of the music  business; there was no holding back The Cars.    With the inclusion of Elliot Easton on lead guitar,and Greg Hawkes on keyboards  [both Berklee School of Music graduates]and David Robertson on drums..The Cars  travelled full speed ahead. In their case, not for a speeding ticket but for  fame and fortune worldwide. This five CD box, might be \\"just what you needed\\"  for about $5 a disc, if you shop wisely. Otherwise another 'option' could be  The Cars Anthology, a 2008 import,[subtitled \\"Just what I needed\\"]and released  in 1995 by Elektra/Rhino records.As a footnote you can still purchase the  Cars by The Cars CD, 1993 release GOLD CD for aproximately $150.    The Cars have been criticised by many for being nothing but a bunch of 'posseurs'  with a magic formula for writing songs. To add insult to damage, they were also  quoted as 'milking' the pop market with their manipulation of 'hooks',  'pretty boyness' and 'coolness' to sell records. Such hogwash. The Cars wrote  fantastic music. For instance \\"Drive\\" is almost the perfect pop song. Just  about the whole nation can try singing at least one line. It is intense!    For the likes of critical musicians, such as myself..I love the 2 disc. 40  songs, 2 hour long \\"Anthology\\" to death.It is brilliant pop songwriting and  of course execellent musicianship. I respect Ric Ocasek for quoting that   \\"The Cars will never re-form.\\" Partly because Benjamin Orr passed away in  2005. He did, however give the green light to Eliot and Greg to form the  New Cars.     Whatever part of the 1980's music anyone decides to purchase, it is my  prayer that The Cars will be on someone's list. Listen carefully..their  music is recorded so well [by Muff], so precise and COOL! \\"Who's gonna  take home these CD's tonight\\"? Well...everyone of course! Let's shake   it up folks...
142313494X|4.0|Also appears on The Screaming Nitpicker.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is your average twelve-year-old troublemaker. Going between different schools with ADHD and dyslexia, he suddenly discovers while on a field trip that one of his teachers is a demon-thing when she tries to kill him. A few chapters after that, he's spirited away to Camp Half-Blood, a training facility for children like him: demi-gods, half-bloods, children of a Greek god/goddess and a mortal parent. Percy is the son of one of the Big Three (Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades), which is a bad thing because those three have been barred from having children again after World War II. Zeus's lightning bolt, his great weapon, has been stolen and poor Percy is the main suspect. Thinking that Hades must have it, Percy, his satyr friend Grover, and Athena-born fellow half-blood Annabeth set off on a cross-country journey to reach Hades and get Zeus's bolt back before the summer solstice.<br /><br />There are few narrative voices in fiction that have entertained me as much as Percy's. He tells the story almost faithfully and his little quips, combined with the funny imagery as events unfold, made the telling of the tale truly entertaining. Riordan obviously put a lot of hard work into The Lightning Thief. The powers of the half-bloods and their weaknesses (like the ADHD and dyslexia) are well-explained and make sense in the context of this novel and there were no glaring errors in his personal mythology that I saw. I was a little miffed that Nemesis, the goddess of revenge and divine retribution and also my favorite Greek mythological figure, was gender-bendered into a man, but that was only problem. Otherwise, it was all good.<br /><br />This novel took many of my expectations and smashed them into dust. I have certain images in mind when I think of the Greek gods and goddesses and their appearances in this book- along with some of their personalities- both contradict those images and go along with them. Like Poseidon's image, for a good example. The way he's described beforehand and just the thought of the Big Three god himself, one would expect him to look a lot more regal than he does when we finally meet him. His chosen appearance in garb you would expect to see a stereotypical Florida guy wearing is jarring in a fun way that will probably make you smile. Other examples include Charon in an Italian suit and Ares in lots of leather and biker gear.<br /><br />I was interested in the story and kept reading without getting bored, but I just wasn't emotionally involved. I cared about how the story worked out and loved Percy's narration of his journey, but none of the characters mattered to me that much. If someone like Annabeth or Grover had died, I would have gone, \\"Huh. That sucks.\\" I have this problem sometimes, but I know I'm capable of being emotionally involved in a book. I just need the right author who can make me feel.<br /><br />While reading this, I was reminded of the Harry Potter series a few too many times to be comfortable. I did not come into this book expecting or wanting it to be like Harry Potter (because while I think those books are fun and all, I'm not obsessive about them and don't seek out books while hoping that they're just like that.) I don't quite feel like going into the similarities I found, but they were there and you'll notice them pretty easily.<br /><br />*Spoiler warning!*<br /><br />At the end, I was a little puzzled because of Percy's mom. I understand why she was with Smelly Gabe: to protect Percy and hide her son's scent in Gabe's awful, overly human scent. Just a passing curiosity, but how did she know he smelled so spectacularly human? Did Poseidon point her to him? Once we reach the final pages of the novel, we discover that Gabe has abused her and Percy leaves her Medusa's head, which she uses to turn him to stone. So she's not brave enough to tell Gabe that she's moving out and wants a divorce once she comes back from being held hostage,but she has enough bravery to murder him? Because that is what she did. When she turned him to stone, he died and won't be coming back. The message of \\"abusive people get what they deserve\\" comes through loud and clear, but yeah... That whole thing bothered me a little.<br /><br />*Spoilers over!*<br /><br />(I saw the movie back in February when it came out, so my horrible affliction came into play while reading: I'm seeing the characters as the book makes me envision them through their descriptions, but I'm hearing the voices of the actors. That means that while I'm seeing twelve-year-olds kicking monster butt, I'm hearing eighteen-year-olds once they start speaking.)<br /><br />While it was an entertaining read, I was unable to bring myself to care about the characters and certain parts of the story made me stare in a manner any bystander would have interpreted to mean, \\"You're kidding, right?\\" I didn't mention any of those certain parts because this is a children's book, after all, so it gets a little bit of leeway.

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I really loved the first IRON MAN, and am very pleased that they released IRON MAN 2, so that Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., and IRON MAN (an interesting trinity) could continue their fight for truth, justice and the American way.  While not as good as the first, IRON MAN 2 is still a good, fun, entertaining film, one that my husband and I really enjoyed watching.<br /><br />IRON MAN 2 basically picks up where IRON MAN left off.  It has been 6 months since Tony Stark revealed to the world that he is IRON MAN.  Stark is fighting to keep his technology from being weaponized by the government, still attempting to achieve world peace, and this time, he is also fighting for his life.<br /><br />The returning cast of IRON MAN 2 (Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson) continue to be outstanding, and the newest members (Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell) are definitely up to the task.  New comic book super heroes and super villains (Black Widow and Whiplash) are added to the mix, and are very fun.  The special effects are top notch (especially dazzling are Whiplash's electric whips), and the plot is enjoyable, though not quite up to the level of the first IRON MAN.<br /><br />It looks like there is going to be an IRON MAN 3, and I hope that the get back that special \\"pop\\" that the first movie had.  There are also going to be a number of spin offs, most notably one for Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.  Hopefully, these movies, too, will live up to the original IRON MAN.  I guess we will have to wait and see.<br /><br />Overall, IRON MAN 2 is very engaging, lots of fun, and definitely worth watching, especially if you enjoyed the first IRON MAN.  RECOMMENDED.
0394800184|1.0|I received this book as a gift but refuse to read it to my kids.  I absolutely hate it.  I echo many of the other negative comments that the premise is simply traumatizing.  Yes, I suppose I am taking it a bit personally, but as someone who worked really hard to be a mom, it's terrifying to imagine my children wandering around asking strangers who I am.  I'm less concerned about the \\"stranger danger\\" issue and more about the emotional distress of being lost.  The whole thing makes me so sad.  I don't even want to donate this book since I hate to think about other children reading it.  This book belongs back in the 1960s.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|While at fairy camp on the Mainland during summer, Tinker Bell (voice of Mae Whitman) can't resist the urge to visit a human dwelling.  Always the clever inventor, she must investigate and determine how an automobile functions.  Soon afterwards, she discovers a child's dollhouse that seems to be perfect for her diminutive size.  Despite Vidia's (voice of Pamela Adlon) warnings, Tinker Bell enters the dollhouse and becomes trapped.  A human girl, Lizzie (voice of Lauren Mote), discovers her.  Initially, Tinker Bell is afraid.  When an opportunity to escape presents itself, she flees.  However, upon realizing the extent of Lizzie's loneliness, Tinker Bell befriends her.  Meanwhile, Tinker Bell's fairy friends are determined to rescue her despite a raging storm.<br /><br />  \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is by far the best Tinker Bell film yet!  It continues the theme of friendship.  Everyone has gifts and talents that makes them special.  However, every fairy (and human) has the gift of being a friend.  With its action-filled, suspenseful plot, this film can be enjoyed by the entire family.  There were a few moments that made me cringe and a few that made me laugh out loud.  Lizzy is adorable and I sympathized with the loneliness she felt when neglected by her overworked science nerd father.  I liked the film's turn-of-the-century, English countryside setting.<br /><br />  Needless to say, the audio for \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is crisp and clear (with optional English subtitles) and the animation is breathtakingly gorgeous, especially on the BD.  The aspect ratio is 1.85:1, which is perfect for my widescreen television.  The picture fills the entire screen.  Each of the BD and DVD disc provides the following special features, which I listed according to my most favorite to my least:<br /><br />  A.  Sneak Preview of Walt Disney's Upcoming \\"Tangled.\\"  Directors Nathan Greno and Bryon Howard provide commentary during scenes of \\"Tangled,\\" which is Walt Disney's long overdue version of \\"Rapunzel.\\"  The beautiful, multitalented Mandy Moore provides the voice for Rapunzel while the comical, cute-as-a-puppy Zachary Levi provides the voice for the thief, Flynn Rider, who seeks refuge in Rapunzel's tower where she is grounded for life.  Both Moore and Levi provide interesting backgrounds for their characters.<br /><br />  B.  Music Video of Bridgit Mendler performing \\"How to Believe.\\"  Looking like a young version of Britney Spears, charming, blonde Bridgit Mendler delightfully performs the lead song while playing a guitar and organizing a talent show with child performers.  This video emphasizes the themes of friendship and cooperation that are prevalent throughout the Tinker Bell films.<br /><br />  C.  Deleted Scenes.  These scenes are hosted by director Bradley Raymond and producer Helen Kalafatic.  The scenes are depicted in various stages of production.  Some scenes are merely animated sketches while only one (Tinker Bell is attacked by the cat while searching the doll house for teacups) is fully animated.  It is my opinion that most, or all, of the deleted scenes should've been left in \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" because it was too short for a full-length feature film.<br /><br />  D.  Fairy Guide Builder.  This is actually a fun, educational memory game for the entire family.  Basically, it is divided into four categories.  Each category consists of multiple choice questions involving the life of a fairy.  They will test how well the viewer was paying attention while watching all three Tinker Bell films.  I actually missed a few questions.<br /><br />  E.  Design a Fairy House.  This segment is hosted by director Bradley Raymond.  It features children designing their own fairy house at the Pixie Hollow exhibit at Walt Disney World.  Raymond, along with producer Helen Kalafatic, conducted a national contest for the best fairy house design.  A winner was chosen, announced to much fanfare, and a replica of the winning entry was constructed.<br /><br />  F.

Also, I was disappointed in that there is an absence of audio commentary or a behind-the-scenes feature with actor interviews.  I would like to have seen the actors perform in the sound studio or discuss their roles as they did in the sneak preview for \\"Tangled.\\"  I adore Kristen Chenoweth (Rosetta), Lucy Liu (Silvermist), and Raven-Symon&eacute; Pearman (Iridessa) and would loved to have seen them interviewed.<br /><br />  Overall, \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is highly recommended viewing for the entire family.  With its continual theme of friendship being a gift and a talent that can be used to help others, the film is very appropriate for little children.  The action will maintain their interest long enough for them to learn the value and importance of friendship.  With a little \\"faith, trust and pixie dust,\\" we can accomplish most anything.

0439023513|5.0|I'm so sad that I finished this series but so glad I started it.  I almost didn't because it sounded too gruesome from descriptions.  It is gruesome, but the author uses it to illustrate the devastation of war.  This last book in the series really takes on the issue of war in depth.  What I love is how the story depicts the complexity of war.  It's not good guys versus bad guys.  There's no character who does war \\"the right way.\\"  It's clear that such an idea is impossible.  The depth to this book extends to the characters.  I was mesmerized by the main character.  Whereas the first two books painted a prettier picture of the hero, Katniss, this final book develops her flaws in greater detail.  We see a hero who is often weak, and confused in addition to fearless and loyal.      After I finished the book, I found myself thinking about holocaust surviviors and how they were able to pick themselves up and find a life after all the atrocities.  Ultimately, I think this book offers a powerful philosophical look at war, especially for a young adult series.  The hopeful 'never forget' theme comes through along with the cynicism that war will never end.

B003QNXPUK|1.0|This product is a waste of money.  While the Instashield is bullet-proof, the edges peel and will not stay down.  The directions says to let it dry with the phone off for up to like 24 hours - which is absurd.  And while iphone 4 reccommends using a case to prevent dropped calls, when sliding many cases onto the phone, the edges peel even more.

They'll send you a new one should it ever fail...but watch out for the shipping an handling charge.  For a 2cent piece of plastic, they stick you for several bucks, so both the purchase price and probably 99% of the replacement fee is pure profit. Plus, you have to return your defective product in a trackable form.  I was very disappointed in this product.  If they improved their adhesive (and customer support) it would be fantastic, meanwhile, to me, it's a rip off.

1453767533|5.0|So I thought that Pride and Prejudice was my favorite Jane Austen book. I was incredibly mistaken after reading Northanger Abbey. The story is told by Jane Austen herself.It is as if she was in the room with you reading it out loud. It is the only one of its kind. It really was a shock to know that this book was published so long after it was written and was one of the first novels she completed.  As I found, this book was hardly re drafted, not like the other stories I believe.  It is the closest we could ever get to Austen herself, the first instinctive writings we could ever read.  Raw and powerful. When it was first published long ago it was some years later when it was written, Austen being the clever lady that she was made the story timeless,, so to speak as timeless goes .. that a women like me in the year 2010 could find enjoyment and humor in a book published so long ago. Now that speaks volumes...

0345298349|5.0|I read 'Gorky Park' because I wanted to see how the author would handle the life of a Militia investigator of the Soviet Union. I figured it would a Detective novel with ranks locations & name Russified & was pleased to find that is was a detective novel but it felt Russian. The novel was beautifully written & filled with character that had entire personalities & motivations. Gorky park was an odd in the sense that throughout the novel I came to sympathise with some characters but never completely. The Soviet factor was too strong. I could smell the cheap tobacco & taste the Vodka but not hear the rumble of the Soviet Moskovich as it slowly made its way to Gorky.
0743277708|5.0|Read it when I was a young mother. Read it again as a grandmother. Still wonderful. I think kids twelve and up should take the time to read it.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|Awful.  Does not deserve one star. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. This movie was a let down. The computer graphics were lacking especially during the early years of that \\"thing\\". And as it was growing up was no better, just a young girl in a mask, and as the adult thing the cg on the legs area stunk.  Lacked content, and over all boring. It had a good concept but failed miserably in its delivery. Don't waste money or time on it. Read a good book.
B003YOZNBU|1.0|Save your money. If you must see it because you love the trailer, rent it, at least you will not be disappointed by the money you spent going to the theater. I am a big fan of these types of movies and I am telling you, the critics are being way too nice. If I could give it a zero I would. This movie was absolutely horrible.
B00003CXB4|5.0|One of the best movies - EVER!  I looked everywhere locally and couldn't find this movie.    Thrilled to have found it at an Amazon vendor.    I was really concerned about buying it from a vendor - wasn't sure if it would be good service,  good quality product or timely shipping, etc....but everything was perfect!    No problems - highest recommendation - received just a few days after my order.    Excellent!
B002BWP4A6|5.0|If you've already seen other films by Henneck, such as \\"Funny Games\\" \\"Caché\\" and \\"The Paino Teacher\\", you're off to a good start.  In my opinion, this is his best work.  It is a film about three unfortunate events that happen to a small German town, and how these unfortunate events change the townspeople.  Shot in beautiful black-and-white, which gives it a haunting mood and foreshadows gloominess that's to come (or for that matters, what's unfolding right in front of us).  Most importantly to this totally capturing story is the combination of timeline, location and the village children... we know that these children are the generation of the majority of Nazis.  These elements all tell a great story from different perspectives, and in viewing it with that kind of mindset, you'll appreciate all the things that are coming together at once, flourishing into one of the year's best movies!
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Love the new album, very soulful and up-beat at the same time.  Nice DVD cover artwork.
B003O85W3A|3.0|Every Arcade Fire release will always be compared to Funeral.  That's not fair, but that's what you get when you make one of the last decade's best records, and one of the few that truly captured the generation that grew up in the 90's and 00's.    The Suburbs has a number of quality tracks but not the production, melody or vision of Funeral.  The singing is often muffled and they undersell their own abilities by leaving certain songs too sparsely arranged while others are overdone.  This record has the sound quality of bands of less talent like The Strokes.  Arcade Fire have a lot more talent than that.  They can ride with U2, Coldplay, The Police or any of the great alternative rock bands.  Their music transcends genres (Just ask John Legend).    This record has far too many tracks to begin with.  Of the 16 tracks, the ones worth keeping are:  The Suburbs, Ready to Start, Modern Man, Empty Room, City with No Children, Half Light I, We Used to Wait.  If you're feeling charitable, then add \\"Sprawl I\\", \\"Month of May\\" and \\"Suburban War\\".    Of these tracks, Empty Room and City with No Children are the best realized.  The most disappointing recording is Modern Man, which is one of the record's best tracks.  Great melody, but underenhanced, poorly sung, and it sounds like an indie band that reached beyond its abilities but didn't quite have the skill to pull it off.  I think it's a great song, but would like to see it re-recorded with some vocal harmony, keyboards/strings to complement the guitar, as well as better singing.  This song should stand right up there with Wake Up, Rebellion and Power Out, but takes several listens to get there.    Another issue with this record is the writing style has changed.  On Funeral, they took simple melodies and built around them brilliantly.  It caused them to be inventive and find different ways to express the song.  That's what created the wild kinetic energy that defined that record. On this record, they are relying on more traditional chord structures, and the hooks we are used to don't always arrive. \\"Suburban War\\" is one example of this.  Nice guitar intro, but no great hook or chorus afterwards.  A lot of the tracks are quite sleepy.    That said, I like this band a lot, and I like a number of these songs.  It is worth owning as compared to other music that is available today. However, I think they can do better.
0525951652|4.0|I understand the outcry about the pricing of kindle edition but to call those protests a book review is not appropriate.  The complaint being lodged has to do with the sale and marketing of a product and not the literary work itself.  Every potential reader will come upon the price at the time of purchase and make their own buying decision based on whatever criteria they typically use to buy or not to buy - reviews, price, experience with a given author etc.      Most of the poor reviews actually come from fans of Follett and their real complaint should be with the publisher who sets the price of electronic editions.  The retailer, who actually understands how to sell books sets the price of the paper edition.      This book is worth reading especially if you like Ken Follett.  If the price is an issue, I suggest you buy the paper edition as it is discounted - yes it seems crazy that the electronic version is more but a reviewer with integrity would at least have read the book before posting a \\"review\\".  How can you be taken seriously as a reviewer having not read the book?      In my opinion this book doesn't have the same \\"magic\\" or charm of \\"Pillars\\" or \\"World Without End\\" but the story telling is every bit as good.  The pages, typical of Follett, fly by and it is a fun read. The characters are engaging but there is no specific protagonists like Tom Builder or Jack.  The characters however are real, displaying gradients of morality much like real life.  The history, if you like history, is great. The lack of magic I mentioned just may be because of the difference of the two time periods - Pillars was set in an era so distant that maybe that's where the magical feeling comes from and WWI history is more familiar.      But, if you like Ken Follett you are missing out on a great read - go to the library, read he book and then review it.  You have the right to object to the price but you also have other options too.  Have some integrity when reviewing a book and aimyour price objection to the appropriate party.    Buy the book or don't buy the book, but it isn't fair to review the efforts of a writer based on marketing decisions made by an out of touch publisher.  Furthermore, the comparison to the paper edition notwithstanding, the read is worth twenty bucks!
B003UYUQZW|5.0|The movie wasn't a huge hit at the box office, but it held my attention and was very fun to watch.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I will admit that I was not so excited when I learned there was going to be a sequel to the Percy Jackson series. I mean, a sequel seemed silly. Percy defeats Kronus. End of story, right? Wrong. The prophecy Rachel makes is starting to happen. And though I was not so excited about a sequel at first, I do not CARE anymore. This book was amazing. Amazing! And the next book is coming out in the fall of 2011! A long wait, but I will be patient. Take your time, Riordan, and live up to your expectations.
B0043IMW4W|5.0|I had the privelege of being at one of the two live performances at the House of Blues in Chicago in 2007 that produced this excellent collection of songs.  The concert was without question the best I've ever been to, over 3 hours of GREAT live blues and blues/rock.  The audience was electric.  We all knew that what we were witnessing was a once-in-a-lifetime show.  The performers seemed to know and appreciate that they were participating in something very special as well, and having a grand time doing it.  Hubert Sumlin, Willie Big Eyes Smith, Bryan Lee, Buddy Flett, and of course Kenny Wayne Shepherd with his longtime compadre Noah Hunt (oh yeah, and Double Trouble!!!) were there and in full force.  This album is an excellent representation of that performance, and I highly recommend it for any blues fan.  The breadth of styles and the generational span of the performers alone should give you some idea of what you are in for.  There are grinding, Chicago-style blues numbers, upbeat and flavorful Louisiana-style blues (Bryan Lee), and of course, KWS own unique brand of driving blues-rock that he has made all his own.  This recording is taken from the concert tour in support of Kenny's \\"10 Days Out: Blues From The Backroads\\".  Check out the description of that item and you'll get a feel for this item as well.  This is that, live, highly electrified, well-produced, and extremely satisfying.  \\"King Bee\\" is alone worth the price.  This is the first KWS live album to be released in his now 15+ year career, and the wait for this album has been worth it.  Bottom line:  Get it.

I also wanted to mention that the movie got a standing ovation & loud clapping of hands by most of the audience...  Thanks for reading my review...
630463949X|5.0|From the first few notes of The Chain I got goosebumps...there were so many moments in this concert which brought tears to my eyes but here are a few-    The Chain-the bridge portion when John McVie plays his short solo before the band takes flight.  Lindsey shredding and Stevie twirling like it was 1977.    Gold Dust Woman- Hands down my favorite performance of this song EVER...simply transcendant    I'm So Afraid-Always a Mac favorite live Lindsey's solo is unbelievable    Temporary One- Who would have thought that a new song would come together so beautifully live    Big Love / Landslide/ Silver Springs- these performances have become legendary.    You Make Loving Fun- the opening riff alone will make you want to start dancing    Go your own Way/Don't Stop/Tusk/Songbird-Talk about closing a concert strong    This is the best live music dvd I own.  If you are not a fan you will be.  If you are already you will absolutely  treasure this

B003D0ZNL0|5.0|EMI's 11 disk set of \\"Rudolf Kempe - Icon\\" gives you much to ruminate over the Dresden-born conductor known for his humanisitic recordings in an epoch when many hangovers from the excessively romantic period (Stokowski, Bernstein) were active side-by-side with the modern literalists (Karajan, Szell, etc.) amidst the golden age of conducting in classical music. During the great era of recordings, Kempe (1910-76) never had a principal post in Europe to match Karjan in Berlin, Solti in Chicago, Ormany in Philadelphia and the rest, aside from being chosen by Beecham as associate conductor with Royal Philharmonic in 1960 where he stayed through 1975.<br /><br />Kempe began life with the Dresden Statskapelle 1949-52, then followed Solti to the Bavarian State Opera in 1952. In the period he spent under Beecham, he conducted both the Zurich Tonhalle and BBC Symphony orchestras. Unlike bigger name conductors in all major markets (Abbado and Davis in London and elsewhere, Mehta in Los Angeles, Munch in Boston, Haitink in Amsterdam, etc.) Kempe never became associated with a single orchestra yet, as this set shows, he produced stunning music everywhere he went.<br /><br />The 11 CDs here reintroduce a new generation of music lovers to some of Kempe's most successful recordings of \\"Richards\\" Strauss and Wagner and show everyone else he knew a thing or two about Beethoven and Brahms. The first two disks include centrist readings of Beethoven Symphonies 1, 3, 5 and 6; disk 3 has the Brahms Symphonies 3 and 4; disk 4 includes Mendelssohn and Scheherazade; disk 5 is a collection of Czech music including the New World Symphony and Bartered Bride excerpts; disks 6 and 7 include some of his best musicmaking from the Richard Strauss orchestral music; disks 8 and 9 include operatic excerpts; and disks 10 and 11 are the typical add-ons EMI gives us in such renderings.<br /><br />To most listeners and collectors, Kempe is best known for his survey of the orchestral music of Richard Strass, and the two disks here including Paul Tortelier's Don Quixote and Kempe's luxuriously humanistic reading of Ein Heldenleben are among his very best Strauss recordings. In new processing, these disks are among the better things in the set. Many do not know Kempe as an opera conductor yet his catalog overflows with chunks of Wagner, some of which are reintroduced here. His Lohengrin with Thomas, Grummer, Fischer-Dieskau, Ludwig and Frick includes six highlights and there are four more from Meistersinger.<br /><br />With Mahler-Bruckner specicialist Jascha Horenstein, Rudolf Kempe was among the best conductors that rode below the surface sheen during the golden era of postwar classical music from 1950 until about the digital era, when things began to change with the deaths of Karajan and Bernstein in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Here is a chance for anyone not familiar with the conductor to get to know him better. This set is more expensive in USA than in Europe but can be had for a reasonable price from Amazon vendors.ere including Paul Tortelier's Don Quixote and Kempe's luxuriously humanistic reading of Ein Heldenleben are among his very best Strauss recordings.

B003ZJJFKE|3.0|I love Satch's playing and his music. However, (and I've said this in other reviews of his stuff) there is something terribly artificial sounding about his last 5 or so studio albums. My favorite Satch album aside from the very old stuff is the self titled album. Its not because I particularly like the bluesey quality of it, but that the supporting musicians actually add something to the music besides a basic rhythm. On that album Manu makes the drums come alive in a way Satch's typical drummer rarely does. With the newer albums, this one included, I wait for live versions to actually love the songs. Whenever Satch takes his newest album to a live version, it becomes much more appealing and its because at that point he lets his supporting musicians have fun. So, for this album, Im sure I'll love these songs once he hear live versions of them, but I just wish Satch would give his supporting musicians some guidelines and let them add to the beauty of his music. His video Reel, really drives home the fact that Satch is crazy obsessed with not letting his musicians stray from his demo tracks. So, its a good album, but it'll be great live.
0385732554|5.0|Great book!  I just reread this after having read it a few years ago in undergrad for a class.  Quick read too, I guess partially because it's written for young adults.<br /><br />Quick synopsis: Jonah, the main character, lives in a world of Sameness.  Everyone is the same, eats the same, talks the same and dresses the same.  Everything is regulated so that no one is different and feels bad because of their differences.  When he becomes a Twelve (his age - everyone changes ages at the same time, on the same day) he gets assigned the job of The Receiver of Memories.  This is a very prestigious job on the outside, but comes with much responsibility.<br /><br />Lowry does a wonderful job making this an easy and enjoyable read.  She also only introduces the reader to pieces and parts of the utopia little bits at a time, where, at first, the reader may think that this world Jonas lives in sounds like a great plan; no pain, no sorrow.  However, as you read on and discover the other things they don't have in their world; weather, hills, mountains, you see that it's not as wonderful as you may have initially thought.
1591396190|5.0|This book does a great job of showing you how many well known companies that have gotten rid of what doesn't matter and focused on what does matter to the customer, and how you can do the same. At the end of the day, that's all that really matters.    Most business owners make the mistake of doing what they think is important, when they should be doing what their customers think is important.    I highly recommend this book for any entrepreneur in any industry.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|First of all I would like to mention that this is a completely non biased comparison between the two. I have personally owned both these headsets and have weighed the pros and cons to both. These headsets are worlds apart as far as the differences go so this review is based on my opinions and experiences.    Lets start with the X41s. I know there alot of people who absolutely swear by turtle beach and many others that believwe they are rubbish. I am a very conscious person when i'm making large purchases and I don't take them lightly in the least. I read a ton of reviews before I bought these and I actually bought the dx11s first. The dx11s are nice however; they are nothing in comparison to the x41s. The x41s are more comfortable and have a much crisper sound then the dx11s so I was immediately happy with the upgrade. The positioning on these was also better. I know the box says 5.1/7.1 but it's really only 5.1 so don't be fooled. Most games don't support any more than that so you will very very rarely see the two lights come on meaning it's translating the sound into 7.1. In either case the ability for me to tell where the sounds were coming fromm was very very good with these. I could clearly hear someone coming up behind me granted that there wasn't alot of other hectic stuff going on. The best part of the x41s the best part about these I would say is the cleanliness due to the fact that it's wireless. It was incredibly easy to hook up. 2 wires and you're done. I know wireless is not without it's faults though. I experienced a very slight hiss with mine but it was only noticable during complete silence. Any sound what so ever and it was gone. I had no other problems with the headset until my cat knocked the transmitter off of my shelf. It was about a 4 foot fall after which the headset made popping sounds every once in a while. Also the headset started powering itself off whenever there was a large explosion in the game I was playing(Battlefield Bad company 2) Before this I had no issues what so ever. the only other con was that it ran on AAA batteries. i never had to change them in mine and I owned it for over a week. After this I took them back and swapped them out for a pair of AX Pros just because I wanted to compair the two.    The AX Pros seemed like a sound investment at first that is until I got them home to try them. I'm not opposed to wires at all but the way you have to hook them up is rediculous. It took me a minute to figure out too. Once it was hooked up I was eager to play. Immediately upon placing the headset on my head and turning it on I heard a loud humming noise. This is probably due to the fact that this headset actually has 4 speakers in each ear cup. It was loud and annoying though and much louder then the X41s. Once I was playing a game it wasn't as bad but it was still annoying. The next thing I noticed was just how bland the game sound was. The speakers are too close together in the headset so some sounds blend together and it becomes hard to differentiate where they are coming from. Even after I changed all the settings (of which there are many) and they still didn't sound that great. It was hard to pin point where a sound was coming from expecially during very hectic gameplay. Also they are very touchy, you bump up the volume once and it may be too loud then down once and they become too quiet. Also the subwoofer I was dissappointed in because the bass isn't tight. It's loud and overpowering even compaired to the X41s which have alot of bass. It made me sad because I had to turn the supwoofer way down to actually be able to enjoy the games and I love my bass! The overall sound quality wasn't good at all. Everything sounded muddy and blurred together which only got mildly better after I fine tuned them. I found myself changing the settings multiple times in each game. The one and probably only plus I found too this headset was that the overall surround sound presentation although a little muddy was very very good. You can even turn up the delay on the speakers and make them sound even better. I tried to use this and get past the other flaws in the headset so I could keep it and be content but I just couldn't. On another note the chat volume seems disproportional to the game volume. The Turtle beaches were sort of the same but not this bad. If you don't want to blow your ears out when you first use them I would suggest turning the center speaker down and also making sure the chat volume is not above half. I liked the removable mic however; the sound quality was terrible according to my brother. He said there was a constant hum behind my voice the whole time. the worst thing and the thing that really made me return this headset for another pair of x41s was that there was no mic monitoring. I couldn't take not being able to hear what I was saying. This headset is really loud most of the time so I was completely cut off from hearing how loud I was being. My Girlfriend said I was talking at a normal volume but I still hated it. I could never be sure.    All in all I hope this helps everyone because I hated reading through a bunch of biased fan boy reviews when I was trying to decide which headset to buy. I am looking into getting a pair of astro a40s but I don't see how much better they can pissibly be. I will post another review if and when I get them. Take care all, have fun and game on!

B003DZX44I|2.0|I have been trying to navigate my way around the second disc of this movie for two days, its impossible . How could kids even find the games let alone play them. And why do Blu Ray discs take FIVE MINUTES to start. Even pushing buttons to hurry it up, it takes forever staring at blank screen. No wonder blu ray is struggling in the market place. It just aint worth the hassles and now it seems it is becoming hard to return to a scene, turn off the disc for five minutes and you need to go back to square one. Nuts. !!!  Blu Ray is over rated and will soon be replaced by a more expedient version.
B000P0J02E|5.0|The soundtrack to the climactic conclusion to \\"Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\\" is just as thrilling as the movie itself. My favourite tracks are: \\"Singapore,\\" \\"At Wit's End,\\" \\"Up Is Down,\\" \\"Parlay,\\" \\"Calypso,\\" \\"I Don't Think Now's The Best Time,\\" \\"One Day\\" & \\"Drink Up Me Hearties Yo-Ho.\\" The love theme is very good, as it encompasses Elizabeth & Will's story, which has been developing through the first two movies, and pays off here. Also, it's so romantic and poignant. \\"Parlay\\" has a surprise composer. The mammoth \\"I Don't Think Now's The Best Time\\" is one of the best tracks on the album; it not only includes Beckett's death music, but the music of Elizabeth & Will's marriage and the fight between Jack Sparrow & Davy Jones. Very good album. If you loved the first two movies and albums, you'll love the third movie and album. Kudos to Disney for again producing a family-friendly movie and soundtrack.
B002QP145C|5.0|The Winter War lasted from December 1939 into April 1940 and was fought between Finland and Russia. How a small country of some 3,5 million people could withstand for so long massive attacks from the mighty Soviet Union of 180 million inhabitants has been a bit of a mystery ever since, or at least until the acclaimed Finnish writer Antti Tuuri published his excellent novel \\"The Winter War\\" in the 1980s. It's an extremely tersely written account told in first person by its main character Matti, a member of the Finnish homeguard, who, along with his younger and somewhat more emotional brother, is called up for military service in the weeks leading up to the war. The novel reads like nothing you have ever seen, with hardly any display of emotion except through iron hard irony. The author does nothing to make Matti sympathetic or even remotely politically correct, in fact he is a former sympathiser with the quasi-Fascist Lappo movement, which conducted an armed revolt against the Finnish government in the early 1930s and was squashed by the regular army. However, by the outbreak of the Winter War practically all internal political disagreements among the Finnish population was put aside in favour of the common cause of keeping the Russians out of the country.    By choosing a main character of this particular kind Tuuri enhances his real message. The interesting thing about Matti is not so much himself as the story he has to tell, a story which is so strong it needs no dressing up or emotional outbursts of any kind. (An English translation of the novel exists but beware, there is at least one other novel out there with the same title) Matti's ultra matter-of-fact, almost cynical way of telling his story is reflected perfectly in the film version of the novel, for which Tuuri participated in the adaptation. There isn't an ounce of sentimentality and none is needed, because the horror and tragedy speaks for itself.    This is the kind of situation small nations and littlepeople often end up in when the big ones decide to have a go at each other. Russia's attack on Finland was officially motivated by the ambition to force through a borderline adjustment that would create a buffer zone for the Red Army in case of a German attack that used Finland as a northern flank. But the Finns didn't feel like handing over vast amounts of productive territory, including the town of Viipuri (the second largest in Finland) in the Karelian Isthmus, and they thought that if they resisted a Russian attack they would be supported by, in particular, Britain. The League of Nations condemned the Russian attack and threw the country out of the assembly. Did they care? Not really. The British offered to send in troops through Lapland but this was really just an attempt to plant own forces in that area and thus cut off the supplies of crude iron from Kiruna in Sweden to Nazi-Germany, essential to the German war machine. Also England and, particularly, France were keen to move the seemingly coming and unavoidable war with Germany away from their own territories, in fact Churchill's prediction at the time was that WWII would be fought out in Northern Scandinavia. However, the Swedes refused Allied troops any kind of access into Lapland in order to maintain their own immensely profitable business adventure with Germany. In the middle of this sad mess of everyone doing what suited themselves best we find snow-covered Finnish trench lines thinly manned with young conscripts and recalled reservists, and a people willing to give anything, including their lives, to maintain their independence as a free nation.    This is really not a film for the tank-spotters or the guts-and-gore brigade, though I'm sure they'll be able to enjoy it very much for its realism and attention to detail. It is a fine work of art where the entire first hour or so has no fighting at all, just little humane stories about these civilians that are being put in uniforms (where such are available) and sent out to war. These chaps are not angels or supermen, they are just people. They are not \\"proud Marines\\" or \\"Airborne\\" or \\"Commandos\\", they are a citizen's army and couldn't give a monkey's whether someone sees them as \\"heroes\\" or not. There is no warrior worshiping or nauseating flag-waving in this film, no talk of making sacrifices and so on. The only relevant thing to these people is to keep the Russians from breaking through their lines and ruining their lives.    Luckily for the Finns, the Soviets completely underestimated the level of motivation among their enemy's troops and threw themselves into hopeless situations abundantly. Their strategy from the start was rigid and vastly miscalculated, and the film makes no attempt to hide this. There was nothing in the attack on Finland in 1939 that can be remotely compared to the kind of force with which Nazi Germany had invaded Poland in September the same year. Particularly, the use of armour and warplanes was comparatively limited, though it didn't exactly feel that way to the Finns, who had practically nothing of the kind themselves and hardly any means to withstand such attacks when they did take place. Hence the invention of the famous \\"Molotov Cocktail\\", as featured prominently in the movie.    The astonishing thing is that by making the Finnish soldier less mythical, this film and the novel it is based on only makes the Finnish resistance even more astonishing. These everyday chaps carried out a defense of their country which bordered on the impossible. Though the Russians inevitably won the war, they were shown very clearly that any attack on Finland would not be worth the casualties, whatever the outcome. What also happens during the telling of Matti's story is that he gradually becomes more and more sympathetic to the viewer or reader, as his inner ice melts and reveals itself as a simple survival mechanism.    The Winter War is a chocking movie. It doesn't tell you what to think, it just showsyou what happened. It's a great film.
B003L77G38|5.0|I have to say seasons 1&2 are just great and I find myself watching them over and over and with the weather getting colder these make for a great tv night. I hope this show is a long lasting one because season 3 is absolutely amazing so far. I can't wait for the twists and turns I know there's to come from JJ Adams and the other creators. So if anyone is out there on the fence about buying the fringe series don't be just do it you won't regret it I promise. UPDATE TO FIRNGE SEASON 3. I'm in agreement with all the other reviews this is by far one of the best shows I've come across recently. At first I just blew on past it then for some reason I bought the first season and that's all it too I was hook. I was a little sad to see fox move it to Friday nights because to be honest it's hard enough having to wait till Thursday to get my dose of Fringe. Like the other reviewers I so hope that there are more seasons to come because it will be shame if it was to end I mean maybe moving it to the syfy channel will help it but I hope more folks start watching it.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|I liked this book.  It kept me wondering right up to the end and it was one of those  on-the-edge-of-your-seat endings.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I've had it for a couple of months now and it does work to a degree.The carbide and ceramic inserts have been able to sharpen up most of my knives to a near razor sharp edge the only exceptions being my Ka-bar 1219 and a tanto Ka-bar warthog which just seems to be unsharpenable(I may have rounded the edge on this one without even knowing it).For these I use the ceramic rod which while does sharpen well it creates a kinda rough edge.I haven't tried resharpening serrations with it yet since I haven't had any that dulled on me so I can't comment on that.The thing is rather pressure sensitive from my experience and it seems feather light contact with the carbide and ceramic is the best any more and it seems to dull your blade rather than sharpen it.Overall great compact sharpener that gets it done when you need it.I carry it around as EDC as a companion to my knife good little combo.
160024131X|5.0|I listened to this while I was in Afghanistan as a MOT member. I was currently training to become a member of a special unit when I got back, and this book was very motivational when I listened to it in my sleeping bag in the LUP's. The story is told very vividly and realistic. The only thing I remember on the negative side is his use  of some weird equipment names (especially  his sniper rifle if I can remember correctly) which I have never heard about before and I suspect are bogus names. Probably just because of opsec?
0553805371|3.0|Nicely bound and printed on great paper stock.  Best quality printed book I have purchased in years.  It will last for 100 years easily, not like the acid paper books that turn to dust.  The book's content is very well thought out, but not enough bang for the buck!
B003VANOFY|1.0|I bought the Creative Labs Sound Blaster World Of Warcraft Wireless Headset and used it for 3 months before they literally snapped in half. I didn't abuse them and when they broke, they broke from a perfectly normal motion of removing them from my head.  Upon a Google search, I discovered HUNDREDS of other owner posts stating that their did the exact same thing.  I couldn't replace them in warranty because Creative Labs requires a serial number, which is NOT printed anywhere on the headset itself but only on the box... which I had long thrown away.<br /><br />The Logitech G930 was my new replacement. There are many user reviews on this headset you can read.  My review is simply going to consist of the following statement: For the same price...<br /><br />The Logitech G930 Headset is SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY to the Creative Labs WoW Wireless Headset, and is by far, the best wireless headset I've ever used.<br /><br />Thank You, and have a nice day.<br /><br />-WW_Dagger<br /><br />EDIT: As of 8-28-2011, I am no longer using these headphones. They signal is continuously dropping out and the software I have found has serious bugs with Windows 7 64-bit. These two things take make this a one star product for me. If your using 32 bit windows or XP, they still get at least a 4 star rating though.
0525951652|5.0|To address all the price critics on this page, I feel I got a bargain paying $20 on Amazon for a $36 book.    Ken Follett has done a tremendous job on this book which, in addition to being entertaining, is very informative. The pacing is somewhat slower than earlier novels, but once you get into it, you'll find yourself immersed in the story.    Having said that, however, the book lacks the intrigue and memorable characters Ken Follett is so known for in his earlier books.    I'm investing myself in this trilogy because I trust the author can string together a great epic. I hope my investment is worthwhile.
0553805371|5.0|One of the most comprehensive and humble books trying to explain life and the universe. M-Theory is unveilled. We are doing progress, but the wise known we still know very little.
1905113153|5.0|This book is by far one of the best, if not THE best book I own in my cake decorating library, and I'd sell my mother to get a second copy if anything ever happened to my first!  Yes the book is PRICEY, but worth every cent - and then some!    The designs and instructions are clear enough to understand, even though it was written with a European audience in mind.  You might need to think a little outside the box in regards to terms we take for granted (sugarpaste is fondant and cocktail sticks are toothpicks) but with a little diligence, it's easy enough to discern what the author is trying to convey.      What I absolutely LOVE in this book - beyond the GORGEOUS full color high resolution photographs, are the templates in the back that help you to recreate the items between the covers.  So many times you thumb through a phenomenal cake decorating book, and it screams \\"look at what I did!\\" but doesn't tell you HOW they did it.  It becomes a tribute to the writer's ego.  No so with this book as Eddie Spence puts all his knowledge on the line for the reader to learn and be able to put into practice.      Not only does the book come with templates, but also a suppliers' list (European, albeit, but you can still have something you've fallen in love with shipped from overseas).     Don't let the price tag scare you away from this fantastic resource!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Although I liked season one, I loved season two.  If you, like I, have read the books, and wish for someone to recreate your imagination for you, then this is not the show.  The show has kept alive the books, in a very different way, so I can continue to enjoy my characters through someone else's imagination.  I love their ideas, and representation of what they can achieve on screen.  Even if I had not read the books, (which would be a shame) then this show stands on its own, especially series two.  I would pre-order series three, just I have the last two, however the ABC in its wisdom, or lack thereof, has decided not to continue the series.  I am more than a little unhappy with that decision, and hope they change their minds.  I will continue to watch these DVD's into the future, but would like to add, that I hope, that I may have more to watch... thank you to the creators, the writers, the actors and crew for at least two exciting seasons; and am very sorry that the ABC has let you and viewers down.
0375842209|3.0|After seeing this book being read by teen-agers on TV, my wife thought it might be O.K. for our nine year old great-grandson. She borrowed a copy from her sister so as not to break the binding on the new one, and started to read. She said it would NOT be right for him, but she finished the book herself. We didn't really know what it was about. World Wat II, the germans, Hitler, and the concentration camps. I didn't read it but I would agree. Maybe 13 and up would be O.K.
B003DZX44I|1.0|When will the movie studios learn?  We don't want DVDs loaded up with crap - we just want to watch the movie.  Takes forever to load on a brand new Blu-Ray player.  Disney FAIL
B003YWUTKM|4.0|If you're an Orb fan, and you enjoyed \\"Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld\\" you'll have some idea of what you're getting with this CD. The Orb specialize in the sort of ambient soundscapes we usually associate with mid-1970s German bands like Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk, albeit updated for the 21st century. David Gilmour's participation here pushes the Orb ever closer to the type of material Pink Floyd recorded before \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" namely epic-length science-fiction themed suites like \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and \\"Echoes\\" or their soundtrack fragments like \\"More.\\" If you enjoy this type of Pink Floyd music - and I do - you're going to particularly enjoy the first of the two suites here.     This isn't really a David Gilmour solo CD. I thought that would have been clear since his name comes below the Orb's in the title, and he's given a \\"featuring\\" status which implies that he's a guest. The Orb are using his guitarwork on a jam as the basis of this album in the same way that they have used samples as the bases of their other work. Suffice to say, Gilmour's personality and style are so strong even in samples that this comes across as more of a collaboration than what it really is. For what it's worth, this comes a lot closer to what I was expecting from \\"The Island\\" as that CD was billed as being chilled, laid-back, and ambient. This is the real deal. \\"Metallic Spheres\\" is meant to be listened to on quality headphones, preferably in the dark, late at night and to challenge your own imagination.  It isn't meant to challenge the status of \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"    It'd be great to have heard a true Gilmour/Orb collaboration, and it's my hope that in the near future the success of this CD pushes them in this direction. If you're expecting something tuneful and discrete, forget it. But if you're expecting something that's rhythmic, hypnotizing, and entrancing you've come to the right place.
0553584537|5.0|As this psychological thriller opens we meet Bobby Dodge, a member of an elite SWAT team who has responded to a call as he was finishing an already long day.  Neighbors have reported hearing gun shots, and as Bobby, a trained sniper, sets up his observation station he can see the drama unfolding in the couple's master bedroom - the husband is standing menacingly over his cowering wife and young son, waving a gun.  As he levels the gun at the wife Bobby makes a decision that will change everyone's life.  Is he a hero or a gun happy hot head? or something else?    The wife, Catherine, is grateful to Bobby, and thanks him for saving her and her son.  This is not the first time her life has been threatened.  As a young girl she had been kidnapped by a child molester and held by him for nearly a month, escaping only by a chance discovery by passing strangers.  It is amazing that she managed to overcome the ordeal and lead a normal life - or has she?    The story begins with several separate plot lines that slowly merge into an exciting climax.  There is plenty of action along the way and lots of twists and turns in the plot that will keep the reader guessing, and turning pages.  This is the beginning of a new series for this author, the characters return in HIDE.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is a terrific dvd for Eagles fans.  Great film and sound quality.  The music has never been this good.  Love the special behind the scene interviews and out-takes.
0790729601|5.0|I remember this movie from when I was a kid and I loved it then and I love it now! the story line is pretty good and the action is done well too.  It's not a deep movie by any stretch of the imagination but it's super entertaining and done well.  Would definitely recommend this movie to Arnold fans and action fans.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Ok, I finally got around to seeing Slumdog Millionaire.  Yes, I was 2 years late but it was indeed worth it.  My only critique would be of the occasional \\"cheesy\\" element within the soundtrack....the sampled strings during dramatic moments.  For the most part the soundtrack was pretty cool, especially the Indian hip hop elements.  Many people have knocked the film for being too predictable, etc. but I think the predictability works in this case.  The naive elements actually made me appreciate how hard filmmaking can be.  This film was really a breath of fresh air compared to what Hollywood pumps out these days.  After the film was over I actually realized how we as Americans have \\"got it made\\".....we have it easy!    The film reminded me of the 1981  Brazilian film,\\"Pixote.\\"  Both films deal with orphaned children and the rough street life they live.  \\"Pixote\\" does not have a happy ending. Slumdog does have a \\"Hollywood\\" ending so to speak.  I've yet to see Luis Bunuel's \\"Los Olvidados\\", another masterpiece dealing with street kids.    Ok, go watch this film, it is a masterpiece.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I got it at Sam's for #13.xx. I really enjoyed this part of my past. They started me on learning the guitar. Being able to see George's playing back then, I can now see what a great master he was at such an early age. You can see how great they were back then. Why they stood apart from all other groups. Also knowing more about their lives now, you can see each guy's personality show through.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|A few minor spoilers.  I was lucky enough to see this in the theater and I think that might have helped.  Its a shame this didn't get a wider release because the big screen added something to the experience.  I am of the opinion that the characters tried just about everything I could think of being trapped 70-plus feet in the air, and when you can't second-guess them, it makes the situation even more terrifying.  I thought the acting was great, the dialogue was decent but  ***SPOILERS***  the addition of the wolves was not necessary.  It did add another level of awful to their situation, but I also thought it was a bit ham-handed.  I honestly don't think wolves would act like that unless they were starving.  But hey, maybe these were.  I think it would have been a bit more believable if there were a bit of foreshadowing earlier about the ski resort having some trouble with wolves.  But again, their situation is terrifying enough without them.
0060839872|5.0|It's a great book that arrived 2 days earlier than I thought it would. It was also in perfect condition. I would definitely recommend the book and the seller.
B00151QYSU|4.0|Click was the kind of movie for me that I've wanted to see but never had a very driving desire to get around to actually seeing it. Fortunately, this movie was among the list of movies an old friend of mine was giving away recently not too long ago so I grabbed it as soon as I saw it.    This time around, Adam Sandler plays a loving husband and father of two whose problem is being too absorbed in his work as an architect. After needing a new universal remote, Sandler finds himself in a Bed, Bath, and Beyond where he comes across Christopher Walken's character, Morty, who gives him what turns out to be a very special remote--one that controls everyday life.    Unfortunately the remote ends up backfiring ultimately leading to a revelation of the true nature of \\"Morty\\" as well as Adam Sandler's character sadly realizing (seemingly) too late how self-absorbed he's been and that it was wrong of him to put his work before his family.     To sum it up, I found it to be a pretty enjoyable movie. Perhaps not one I would pop in the DVD player every other day, but decent and enjoyable none the less. Although, one con I would say is that the farting scene went on a bit long for my tastes.    Before I watched, I figured the movie would be like most Adam Sandler movies--a simple lighthearted comedy. However, I was happily surprised to find out that the movie also feels more than just a simple comedy.     If you're an Adam Sandler fan and have not seen this movie, I would suggest you do. I'm not a huge Adam Sandler fan and I enjoyed the movie.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Its a real good SLR camera bag for beginners who needs to carry the basic stuff like the camera, 2 or 3 lenses, flash, charger, etc. I find it very convenient and best thing i like about it is you can strap it around your waist. So if you need to take out anything, you can simply remove it from your shoulder and rotate the bag along the waist and access it. No need to take it off completely. Probably many other bags will have this but i like this bag for that. The inner compartments made for lenses and camera are real good. Also it has multiple small pockets to keep stuff. I even carry my netbook in this bag. So it serves as a multi purpose bag for me. Excellent choice for beginners.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|The remaster of the original Double Fantasy is beautifully done. Like many of the second wave of digital remasters, it adds depth, detail and clarity without messing with the essential sound of the original. To me it's on par with the remastered Milk and Honey I already have; less dramatic than the recent Beatles remasters though (probably because of the better quality source material).<br /><br />The stripped down disc though is where this really shines. Obviously this is where people's opinions differ. For myself: as much as I love the original, it is so sweet to hear it without the 80s overproduction. Although they made a few decisions I disagree with (some parts of some tracks sound more like demos than than alternate production values - most especially, the opening chords to Starting Over, which just sound thin and sloppy), overall it's a sublime revisioning of the album with a rougher, rawer edge that I like. A huge aspect of this is to do with Lennon's voice having been stripped of all the reverb and double-tracking. He has such a gorgeous voice, so expressive, and John Lennon the person really comes through here in a way he couldn't under all that processing.<br /><br />This takes it to another area where I have seen this criticised. John Lennon HATED the sound of his own voice and was always changing it through double-tracking, reverb, speeding up, and so on. He would NEVER have let this be released (and Yoko said as much in an interview). But I'm glad it was anyway, because it's really something. We don't always know what's best for us, and we don't always assess ourselves accurately. John was wrong about himself in this regard. (And for those outraged that \\"other people\\" should come in and make these decisions, Double Fantasy was never a John Lennon album: it was a John Lennon and Yoko Ono album and she has as much right as him to make decisions about it.)<br /><br />And speaking of Yoko: unlike many I don't hate her material but I do find her voice difficult, and I don't think it always fits well alongside John's. But the stripped down treatment is very kind to her material. Her voice doesn't trouble me in the same way, and the overall feel and sound of her songs is, somehow, in some way, better.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd recommend the remastered original album to anyone (it is a true classic of our time, being a beautiful comeback album from a great artist reinventing himself), but the stripped down version is probably for those who are fans or just appreciate his work.<br /><br />Dean
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have done MANY different types of workouts in the gym and at home.  I am not in top shape at the moment but only about 10 pounds overweight.  I am also 49 years old.  The 3 workouts are actually closer to 30 minutes which is great.  It's amazing how she can pack a great workout into 30 minutes.  I think it's a great place to start.  I also own P90X and found it disheartening because it is SO difficult and there is no way I can make it through a whole workout.  I am hopeful that this DVD will be a good catalyst and buildup to P90X.  The 30 day Shred manages to hit all of the body parts and incorporate cardio, strength training and abs.  I would say that it is a great $10 investment.  All you need is a mat if you are not on carpet and a pair of hand weights.  I used 5 pounds and managed but it was taxing.  This is a great place to start but by no means easy.  All of my body parts hurt and it's a great feeling.  I would also recommend this for males.  It is a mini boot camp type workout.
0385342047|2.0|I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's books and the ones she has written under the name of Madeline Wickham.  I've enjoyed them all and was looking forward to this one.  However, I very soon got weary of the same selfish behavior Becky has exhibited in the earlier books.  Sure, she came from a looney family (who hasn't) but she continually fails to grow up and take responsibility for her actions.  I've given up on authors in the past (Patricia Cornwell and Sidney Sheldon) and I'm afraid I will now give up Ms. Kinsella with her weary tales of Becky.  It was a fun ride, but the scenery got redundant.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I was 12 when I witnessed that first Ed Sullivan show. Even then I knew that this was a genuine historic musical, cultural and even spriritual event. That first performance started me down a lifetime path of musicianship, songwriting and music production. This re-issue of those incredible performances provide me with the opportunity to look back again, but this time with a great deal of real life experience as a musician/performer. It reaffirmed what I instinctively knew so long ago - there really is no other job than working with music. This DVD set provides a look at what is the foundation of many more musician's lives than mine. You might say it's the pop musician's Constitution.

0679745203|5.0|I found The English Patient to be a fantastic book, but one which is a bit emotionally taxing, particularly the utterly heart-rending ending, which I won't give away, but which tears the community of World War II survivors apart.    I know that for most people The English Patient conjurs up ideas about a great tragic love story between the main character--the English patient--and his forbidden love.  For me, however, the love story fell a little bit flat.  Maybe it was because I had heard so much about the romantic side of the narrative and perhaps had expected too much from it in terms of romance.  And while the love story certainly is central to the plot surrounding the English patient, it's hardly the kind of romance for which anyone would hope themselves.  This is not the kind of love story which will make young women fantacize about being Katherine and falling for the mysterious desert-obsessed English patient.  Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I didn't shed any tears over the end of their doomed romance, as I had found it rather uninspiring myself.      *note that I have not yet seen the film of The English Patient.  My understanding is that the impact of the final scenes is significantly different, bringing more focus and attention to the love story, and for this reason the love story may be more powerful in the film, but I'm not in a position to judge.*    What truly touched me about the narrative of The English Patient was everything but the English patient.  Hana was one of the most interesting characters in the novel, in my opinion, as was Kip.  Now that I consider this, it's really not all that surprising given my interst in postcolonialism--particularly Indian literature--since Kip and his relationship with the other characters in the novel, all of whom are western define the final conflict of the narrative as a conflict between the west--symbolized in England--and the east--symbolized in both Japan and India.  I'm afraid to go on about the powerfulnature of this relationship and the consequences for the end of the novel because I don't want to give away too much about the end of the book.  My hope, after all, is to inspire others to read great literature, not to make reading great literature unnecessary as I summarize it all.  :)    Another very powerful relationship within the novel was the relationship between Hana and her father.  I found Caravaggio a rather uninspiring character, but his role within the context of Hana's relationship with her father was crucial.  I found that Caravaggio was most interesting and complex when he reminisced about his history as a friend of Hana's father and his memories of her as a child.  Hana's final coming to terms with her relationship with her father, with her place in the war, and with the circumstances of her father's life was also extremely powerful, but again I don't want to give too much away.    Suffice it to say that The English Patient is one of those books which everyone ought to read, though be warned that while it is a deceptively slim novel it is also powerfully heavy and an incredibly serious novel.  This is one which you won't forget any time soon, and which you will likely mentally chew over for a long time to come.    Read all of my book reviews on my blog at [...]
B002ZG98XW|4.0|Denver housewife Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) takes over her father's horse racing empire when he falls ill, commuting to Virginia to take care of the farm. Having grown up in the racing world, she knows about bloodlines and invests all her efforts in young Big Red, soon to be renamed Secretariat. She hires a good, but retired trainer (John Malkovich) and soon the horse is headed for the Triple Crown.<br /><br />Secretariat was arguably the best race horse ever and deserved a good movie. And while the movie is good, it isn't great because Penny is the focus and the \\"Don't call me a housewife!\\" mantra gets old fast.  Her success shouldn't have surprised anyone since she grew up in the horse business. She didn't have a personal, loving relationship with the horse; he was merely a meal ticket. The movie's excitement comes from Secretariat's races, which are filmed with heart-stopping intensity. The final race of the film has got to be the Most Exciting Horse Race Ever. It simply is not to be believed.<br /><br />Diane Lane is fine in the role and the early 70s are recreated well with period cars and wardrobe. If you're a racing fan, you'll enjoy this film.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|We loved this movie! I previously rated it 5-stars! We missed it in the theatre and borrowed the Special Edition version from our local library. The SE has some great extras on it!<br /><br />I have just contacted my 2nd Amazon seller, who sold me a NON-Special Edition copy! No extra features! No problem, you'll get a refund once you return the \\"wrong\\" version DVD! Yeah, Right! I'm wasting my time (and money) with vendors who don't give a crap whether I get the DVD I ordered or not! No, I don't get all my money back, because I no longer trust these sleazy vendors to claim I even sent their mistaken DVD back! So I end up paying for delivery confirmations!<br /><br />Buyer Beware! Amazon used to have some decent 3rd party vendors. My experience says otherwise!<br /><br />Yeah, I purchased two copies of this DVD, but I never got even one, and I'm out money! Screw me very much!

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone who read and adored the Percy Jackson series, and I really recommend it for people who read the first series, and were wary about Percy's age*. Also, as someone who first learned the Roman names and mythologies, I really love the inclusion of the Roman aspects of the Gods. The subtle changes in the Gods and the differences hinted at between the camps are great. It's a good way to keep the story fresh and still show that there are differences to how the Gods were portrayed in different ears of mythology, something a lot of people tend to forget.    *I started reading the Percy Jackson books earlier this year (I know, I was way behind the times), and I was immediately drawn into the world. Rick Riordan had done something that I had doubted could be done- he pulled old Greek myths into a new world, and made it all fit together almost seamlessly. However, there was one problem that I kept running in to:  I was an older reader coming into a series about a twelve year old. The next three books repeated the same type of opening, and kept rehashing information that was learned earlier in the series, which is a great way to remind readers what is going on, but it was also slightly annoying for me. I realized that the series was written for kids younger than me, and that it didn't matter, and I got over it pretty quickly, but sometimes (in the first few books) I was put off by some of the sillier humour and the repetition of facts (which also bothered me about the Harry Potter series when I reread it last summer). The books started getting better as time went on, and I still consider The Last Olympian to be on of my absolute favorite books of all times.     Which is, I think, why I love this new series so much- it starts off in a similar writing style to The Last Olympian. The protagonists are the age Percy was when we left him, and everything seems a little more foreboding than the first Percy Jackson book. I think Riordan realized, much like JK Rowling did, that the age group for this series would probably be a little older than the age group he had in mind when he started on Percy's books. His fanbase aged with Percy, and they would have hated to start over with someone who was 12 and still going through early adolescent problems.     The increased age of the protagonists also makes for a better, darker story than I was expecting. The three person narrative gives great insight to the feelings of three very different characters, all who are interesting. The task that lies ahead will be tough for them, and the hints that it will be more challenging than the original Great Prophecy make it even better, in my opinion.     All in all, fantastic start to what I am hoping will be an even better series than the Percy Jackson series was, which will be hard to do. I am eagerly anticipating the release of the next book. I can't wait for next year!

B000062XGD|5.0|Tom Hanks is great, Helen Hunt is great, too, even for a small part.  This movie is interesting to the last moment.  The plot is terrific and the plane crash scene is so believable that you think you are there.  As usual, Tom Hanks makes his character so believable that you wish the story would go on to more episodes.
1439163146|4.0|This is a book of short stories by the multi-talented James Franco. The stories explore the lives of a group of teenagers from Palo Alto, the town where Franco grew up.  The language is terse, and the stories strike a universal cord:  it's a difficult transition from teenager to adult.  But beware; this is no kid's book. These teenagers engage in some very adult activities. If you enjoy the genre of the short story, you will enjoy this book.

B001QXCYZY|5.0|So I bought this mic 2 weeks ago and it has amazing quality. When you first get it, it might not be as loud which may make you mad. But if you play aroud with your computer and get the right settings, its Amazing- way better than the samson's condenser mics. One little annoying thing is that the shipper is from New York, so the shipping took awhile, or maybe it was just because I really wanted it so i couldn't wait.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|Every year Hollywood releases a few teen movies. If you're like me, it gets like watching the same movie over and over.  Not so with Easy A. It manages to be smart, funny and original, and appeal to a much wider audience than just teens.<br /><br />Olive Prendergast is a smart good girl with a clean reputation.  When she fibs to a friend about an intimate weekend with an imaginary boyfriend, and another girl overhears, it sets in motion a series of events that speak volumes about high school life.<br /><br />Her flawless reputation gets ruined, but she seems unperturbed by this.  In fact, word trickles through the grapevine, boys approach her, ask her to help out their love lives by agreeing to be their pretend  girlfriend, and improve their reputations.  At once this movie is part satire and part social commentary.  If you have read the recent news about teen suicides, you will realise that your status and how are perceived are both important, in the high school setting.<br /><br />An interesting analogy is drawn between this movie and the Scarlet Letter, where a woman's reputation gets ruined by a scandalous affair and she becomes ostracised and condemned by her community, even sentenced to be hanged.  Olive wears the scarlet letter A with easy pride becoming her own social experiment.  She gets ostracised, scolded by the moral police and survives.  Ironically, other people get better reputations because of her bad reputation, and that's all it is - reputation.<br /><br />It makes you wonder about the double standard between boys and girls.  If a boy does the same thing, he's the man, he gets high fives, and gains status.  You may wonder if she will be able to save her reputation, and how she would save it.  It's a good thing to wonder.<br /><br />Much hypocrisy gets exposed along the way.  If you like to watch a movie that goes a little deeper than the usual teen movie, watch this one.  It's one of the best I have seen.  Emma Stone of [[ASIN:B002WY65VU Zombieland]] plays the lead, and does an extraordinary job. If you wish to see more  Emma Stone check out [[ASIN:B003U6SJYU Paper Man]], where she steals the show in a breakout role.  Amanda Bynes, plays the moral policewoman. Emma reminded me a little of Lindsay Lohan, and in a good way.<br /><br />If you have teens or are a teen, or if you used to be a teen, or intend to be a teen go see this movie.  I give an Easy A.nary job. If you wish to see more  Emma Stone check out [[ASIN:B003U6SJYU Paper Man]], where she steals the show in a breakout role.  Amanda Bynes, plays the moral policewoman.

0316069485|5.0|The Reversal by Michael Connelly<br /><br />Harry Bosch is a minor but important player in this book.  Mickey Haller of the Lincoln Lawyer is the main character.  A convicted killer is appealing his conviction and Mickey Hailer crosses over to the dark side to prosecute his re-trial.<br /><br />Mickey is a likeable character who has emotional difficulty going from his white knight defender role to his dark side (his feeling) acting as a temporary prosecutor.<br /><br />As always Connelly does a nice job setting the stage.  Bosch is still a hero who is hard to like.  Prickly but passionate in his love of his daughter is one of his few redeeming characteristics.  Mickey's inability to maintain a stable relationship is balanced by his love for his daughter.  As half brothers, Mickey and Harry show normal sibling conflict.  The story is convoluted enough to maintain your interest and tense enough to defy you to put  it down.  Another winning read from Michael Connelly.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book.
0385738757|2.0|Let me be clear: THE MAZE RUNNER was not one of my favorite books.  That book had an interesting premise bungled by poor execution, but I slogged through it and hoped that, maybe, once those boys got out of their bloody, shucking Maze, the BIG REVEAL (i.e., the experiment) would somehow lead to something more worth reading.    Well, that would be no.    Some reviewers have compared this book to LOST, and they're not wrong.  That is, also, not a bad thing; LOST was a fabulous show, particularly early on.  One of the many problems that plagued LOST--at least, in my opinion--was its inability to sustain its puzzle over the long haul, resorting to half-baked mythologies and melodrama which finally demanded much more of its watchers than they received, while tying up (some) loose ends with pablum.  The reason people put up with that for so long was the hope that the flashes of brilliance they'd seen earlier might show themselves again.    No such luck there, or here.  While there are not many resolutions in THE SCORCH TRIALS, I'm fine with that; ambiguity doesn't bother me.  What bothers me is a) repetitiveness, b) passive narration, and c) extraordinarily poor, wince-worthy execution, all of which this book has in spades.    Others have pointed up the passive narration, so I won't belabor that.  But let's take a look at a representative paragraph: \\"Never before had silence seemed to have its own sounds.  Like a buzzing hive of bees, it settled on the room with ferocity, making Thomas reach up and wriggle a finger in each ear.  Every breath, every sigh in the room was like an explosion compared to the bizarre haze of silence.\\"    Uh . . . what?  Sure, I get the metaphor . . . sort of, but the execution is on a par with the one about Thomas waking up and feeling as if someone's hammered chunks of ice into his ears.  If he's got a headache spiking his ears, just say that.  Silence having a sound of its own is nothing new (and there's nothing wrong with writing that either).  But that has to be one of the clunkiest, most bizarre *hazes* of writing I've read recently.  Just step back and try to figure out what that passage sort of, kind of means.  Then, try to wade through a whole book filled to bursting with that kind of drivel and see if a bizarre haze of boredom and irritation doesn't settle over your brain . . .     Writing clunky metaphors simply to avoid the perception of being derivative is no excuse.  Better to write it straight so the words make sense.  Otherwise, you frustrate the reader on several levels, not the least of which is enjoyment.  If you're going to make me work this hard to wade through your book, it had better be one amazing story.  This, unfortunately, is not.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Not only is the price right, but this is an already well reviewed cooling tower and in my opinon an outstanding buy.

B002ECEHZQ|5.0|Ashley had never given me a lick of trouble on any of our previous trips. I'd felt confident that she was a pretty easy resilient child who simply needed a helping hand to fulfill her own natural human potential. I expected challenges, but was never in a million years prepared what was in store when she decided to test our boundaries.  Ashley started to run away from me, laugh at inappropriate times when I reprimanded her, snatch things away from the boys, basically Ashley screamed out for attention the attention she never received at each stage of her development.  I'd read `Holding Time,' a book recommended by Wendy, our adoption Director which provided strategies to deal with behaviors of institutionalized children. Attachment therapy is holding therapy in which the child is held firmly by a primary caregiver. It is a process of restraint and confrontation.   The first stage begins as the child protests being held. I grabbed Ashley as she tried to dart away from me when I reprimanded her. Ashley struggled to get free from me. \\"That is not the way we act in our family. We do not touch things that do not belong to us.\\"  Ashley did not want me to hold her. She continued to struggle to get away from me. I considered myself to be a woman with a strong will and able bodied. Ashley flailed, scratched, and bit me as she tried to get loose of my hold. I used every ounce of strength and tenacity that I could muster to prevent Ashley from breaking away from the embrace.  \\"You bi hurtin'mi,\\" she screamed and wailed. Ashley had a set of lungs that could pierce an eardrum.   \\"I am not hurtin' you. I will hold you no harder than is necessary,\\" I said, speaking quietly and calmly with resolve to finish what we'd started. I hadn't expected to take that course of action, but there we were in the middle of it and there was nothing to do but keep going.  I was afraid that someone might hear Ashley and think I was `hurtin' her', in fact, Ms. Parchment came into the room to see if shecould help. I held on to Ashley explaining what I was doing. I thought she might interrupt, insist I let Ashley go, and put us right back to square one; but Ms. Parchment seemed to understand.   \\"She's not hurtin' you Ashley, be still and listen you your Mother.\\" Ms. Parchment's words fed me the strength I needed to complete the task.  Ms. Parchment gently repositioned Ashley's arms satisfying herself that Ashley was in good hands.  \\"I'm not going to give up,\\" I said, if I do Ashley will have won the battle and I will have to start all over. She is getting so big and strong, if I do not win now I may never win her over.\\"  \\"I just wanted to see if you needed my help,\\" said Ms. Parchment leaving us as she'd found us. There I lay, with Ash across my chest as if she were a small infant. The boys continued to watch Sponge Bob Square Pants on the end of the big bed.  It had been two hours and forty six minutes since the charade began. Finally, her resolve dissipated. I held Ashley closer against my breast looking down into her eyes as I had when I'd breastfed my biological children. She looked back at me intensely with tenderness in her eyes. We were both physically and emotionally exhausted. I relaxed my hold on her and she snuggled deeper into me.   Sidney snapped a picture of that moment. I looked as though I'd just gone through labor. Ashley clung to me as a newborn child. We both looked content. Ashley fell asleep in my arms. We lay there for the next two hours both newly committed to our relationship as Mother and Child.  In theory, when the child's resistance is overcome and the rage is released, the child is reduced to an infantile state in which he or she can be \\"re-parented\\" by methods such as cradling, rocking, bottle feeding and enforced eye contact
1897093519|5.0|Many of the main ideas of Romanticism are seen in Mary Shelley's book Frankenstein. The romantic period is characterized by a movement and departure away from scientific and rational ideas, in literature, ideology, and art. The artwork from the romantic era strove to capture and represent the sublime, the experience of nature, and the personalization of these experiences. This particular work of Mary Shelley is a story that is not from her own personal experience nor written in her own voice. This work is about a quest to achieve the sublime. Through the use of emotionally stirring words and a creative, gothic mood, Mary Shelley creates a romantic piece of artwork that drives one towards personal discovery and romantic ideology. Frankenstein is about Dr. Victor Frankenstein's quest to create a living being out of raw materials in his laboratory. With an emphasis on a \\"new way of seeing things\\", Dr. Victor Frankenstein applied imagination and creative thinking in order to better understand the world, perfect the vision of human beings, and better characterize the society in which we live. Being the dreamer, who is preoccupied by the sublime, suggest Dr. Victor Frankenstein and this novel, as a wonderful romantic work.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|In the vein of Alfred Hitchcock, Ian Fleming and John le Carre, this story of international assassins delivers a very satisfying experience.  It's not an \\"action movie.\\"  If your attention span is short, then watch SALT.  If you enjoy a thought-provoking tale of intrigue that keeps you guessing all the way to the very, and I do mean very, end, then THE AMERICAN is for you.  There are time-consuming sequences in the film that communicate the tedium of laying low to avoid discovery.  Unfortunately, this realism seems to have turned off some cinema-goers who expected a kinetic 007-type assault on the senses.  In THE AMERICAN, we have a drama of a paranoid lone wolf hitman who is a prisoner of his own profession, where all Europe is a place of fear and suspicion.  The movie is peppered here and there with both violence and romance.  When the action does come, it's brutal and decisive.  When sex does happen, it's raw and impactful.<br /><br />So settle down with a meal or ample supply of snacks and watch this really cool movie.  You'll have a ball trying to figure out who wishes Clooney's character well, and who is out to kill him.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch had been on my radar for about two years and I finally purchased it when the price began to drop.  For the money, this is an excellent automatic timepiece.  I've had this watch for just over a week and it is gaining about 15 seconds per day.  This compares with other Seiko 5s that I own, which also employ the 7S26 movement.<br /><br />What I like:<br />Classic field watch styling<br />Pilot-type dial is easy to read<br />Brushed case and strap hardware<br />Finish details are well done for the price point<br />Day and date<br />Accurate timekeeping<br /><br />What I dislike:<br />Strap is not quite wide enough to cover the edges of the springbars<br />\\"Seiko 5\\" logo is reflective while all other dial printing is matte<br />Case is polished between the lugs<br /><br />At approximately 38mm, this watch is a bit small by today's standards.  I consider this a positive attribute.  I have 6.5\\" wrists and this watch is a perfect fit.  I'm ready and willing to buck the trend of nutty oversized watches (> 48mm).  This watch will never go out of style.<br /><br />I actually like the strap.  It was comfortable from the start.  If you decide to replace it with a leather strap you may want to find one with a brushed buckle.  The typical polished buckle straps may look awkward against the watch's brushed case.<br /><br />If you want a classic-sized automatic field/pilot watch, look no further.  You will not find a better bargain.  You'll get an accurate, attractive watch that can be worn with almost any attire.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My kids LOVE this movie...even in September. We watch it all year and when the regular version got all scratched up they watched the 3d one without glasses. This is unusual for us because my kids, 3 & 5 year old girl & boy, don't watch much tv. There aren't many movies or tv shows that  hold their attention. They would rather be outside riding bikes and playing in the dirt. I don't know what it is about it, but they will watch The Polar Express quietly over & over. They can repeat the lines & frequently use the expressions in their conversations, which we don't mind since it's a pretty wholesome movie.
0385342047|5.0|Mimi is a two-yr old terror! She gets into EVERYTHING, and causes havoc wherever she goes. Becky & Luke don't quite know how to handle her. It makes me feel SO MUCH better about my two little terrors. lol.<br />This book was classic Becky. Becky and Luke are all set to buy their new home..FINALLY...when there is a sudden financial crisis with the England Banks, and everyone is going frugal. This is obviously hard for Becky, especially since she wants to plan a surprise birthday party for the busy Luke...who doesn't care much for birthdays. No one thinks Becky can do it, so she sets out to prove them all wrong. The whole book was just great! I loved every bit of it, and am so happy Sophie hasn't lost her touch! Great addition to the Shopaholic series!
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I first heard Devo was coming out with a new album, but then I heard them on the Colbert Report with the single \\"Fresh.\\"  I was totally blown away.  And the album just gets better with every listen.  Each song is a solid entry in the Devo songbook with enough 80s influence to remind us why they were so good at the time and why they are even better today.  Devo has taken pure 80s bliss and turned it int0 2010 gold.  Something for Everybody should be an album of the year candidate with catchy hooks from \\"Fresh,\\" \\"What We Do,\\" \\"Later is Now\\" (a really nifty send up to their original sound that works just as great now as then), and \\"March On.\\"  Those are just my favorites, but every track is brilliant and fun.  Well worth the money to pick up this album which truly is for everybody.
B003LAH7MU|2.0|I would like to start by quoting that I highly value Sting as a musician and composer. At the same time I have the feeling that his first solo album blue turtle etc. has been his best achievement after the police. with an excellent and energetic band  and extremely adequat rithm section at hand. This project with a symphony orchestra is always tricky and my hunch that it will be not very interesting with old stuff polished into a violin setting is confirmed.  No surprises in the arrangements and why not try completely new compositons instead of roxanne for the 50th time ?  Sting plays it safe again and as he has become financially independant why not try a challanging type of music.

0316098337|3.0|I was disappointed by this book.  All the great reviews lead me to believe that it would be page-turner and it just wasn't.  Reading a whole book written in an five-year-old's flat childish voice was tedious.  I wanted an in-depth examination of the emotional repercussions of their captivity but what I got was factual descriptions of Jack and Ma's activities. Their emotions are glossed over, which is to be expected when the narrator is a child. Without understanding the characters' emotions, the reader is at a loss to know what motivates their behavior.  For example, what made Ma breastfeed Jack for so long?  Was it for nutrition since they were underfed or was it for emotional reasons?  Who knows?  Many times, I wished that Donoghue had chosen a different approach to telling the story.  The story could have been fascinating, but telling it from little Jack's perspective created a shallow book.    I bought this book for my Kindle, but I wish I hadn't.  I only allow myself a certain number of Kindle reads since they usually cost money.  This was a book I should have checked out from the library since it was such a fast and not very enjoyable read.  It wasn't worth the $9.99 I paid for it.
0393324818|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I won't repeat what others have already said.    If you like baseball or if you work with statistics, this is a MUST read.  It is all about metrics.    I work as a program analyst so this book was enjoyable from both a sports bars aspect and a problem solving perspective.      Moneyball should be a high school text book as it would give students a completely different and more exciting appreciation into the use and value of statistics.
0810983915|5.0|I think this book was the best book i have ever read in my entire life! One of the reasons why i love this boom so much is because it is outrageously funny. I have read all of the book series that are out and i definitely think this one is the funniest, humors, children book i have read. If you are in the 3rd grade up to 6th grade this is the best book you will have ever read in your life. Ever since  I have read the first sentence of the first book of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Jeff Kinney has been my favorite author, and i thought Dave Pilkey was hilarious.
0307592839|3.0|I think this is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- the critics' praise raises expectations too high.  What others consider an innovative approach to novel writing I consider a bunch of related short stories (and didn't Salinger kind of do that already with the Glass family?).  To be fair, I prefer novels to short stories, so maybe it's just me.  But between the damaged characters and disjointed flow, this just wasn't an enjoyable read.    The \\"chapter\\" I liked most was \\"Selling the General\\", with a tone that was a bit breezier than the rest of the book.  The part told in PowerPoint was just plain irritating:  wouldn't want to sit through a 70+ slide presentation in real life, certainly don't want one as part of my entertainment pursuits.  And while I realize a teenager journaling in PowerPoint wouldn't care about cohesiveness, as a reader it's reeeaaalllllllly annoying that each slide is a different format.  I had to force myself to finish; it made me want to put the book aside and spend time at GraphJam.com, which while also multi-formatted, is at least clever and amusing.    Overall, a tad too affected for me, but if you're a fan of the short story genre it may be worth a look.

B003CR9BYE|5.0|So like me, you have almost everything the \\"Chairman of the Board\\" put out including the \\"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antionio Carlos Jobim\\" and the lesser \\"Sinatra & Company.\\" There are 3 hidden pieces here which say a lot for the predecessors.  The gem for me was \\"Bonita\\" but then it has been my favorite Jobim ballad, about love longed-for, since I first heard it on his two 60's Warner classics.  The real fact is that Jobim stated, when in his native Brazil, that he really did not adore this pairing. He felt it was too anglicized ( my choice of words, not Jobim's). The truth is, after hearing this new release, I almost understand why. It all comes out in \\"Desafinado.\\" Sinatra hums behind Jobim's vocal solos, which is clearly picked up by the mic's, and then changes the English translation by singing \\"groove\\" instead of \\"rules\\" so that Jobim's rhyme is lost, but Jobim plugs on anyway. No big thing? Jobim was a bit more purist than that, and I doubt you can miss the \\"bomb\\" yourself.  So be it, \\"The Song of Sabia\\" is a surprise and I think despite any tension I might imply here, is easily cured by the fact that these two took a chance with eachother. That was pure genius. So was getting Ogerman! Three missing tunes that make our \\"collection\\" complete...I hope!
B002ZG98XW|5.0|Horse racing is a world unto itself.  Guarding the family jewels is de rigeur.  'Secretariat' displays those jewels for the world to see and then returns them safely home.  Even those who know the tale will warm to this well-crafted homage to arguably one of the great horses of modern track history.  Big Red sported a life worthy of the silver screen, uninhibited by media while spoiling for the next race.  W.C. Fields warned never to make movies with kids or animals.  But even W.C. was known to miss the bottle on occasion, though admittedly not often.  Seasoned casting brings together an ensemble that loops the audience into the reality of life being invaded by life.  A fast movie about a fast horse in a life quicker than a weaver's shuttle.  Don't blink.  You'll lose it.  Then you'll miss one of life's greatest joys, the pleasure of great company.  'Secretariat' gives it, running away.

B0001GMIOE|1.0|I bought this \\"Canon\\" replacement battery a year ago. It came in Canon packaging the battery is Marked Canon. It never quite fit in the charger the same way the other batteries did. It was always lose. I did a wedding the other day and had to switch batteries. I used this battery and within 10 minutes I noticed the battery was dead. I did some research online after comparing batteries and found out that Amazon sold me a fake canon battery. The battery is crap and won't hold a charge because it clearly doesn't fit in the charger. Looks like i'm out $40 bucks.

B002UXRGLG|5.0|Life is yet another amazing series narrated by David Attenborough.  The footage is gorgeous and extremely intriguing.  Much better than Discovery's version narrated by Oprah Winfrey.  I have seen both and Attenborough just has that classic coolness and excitement about him.  Plus, he actually deals with animals so he understands and knows what he is saying, where as Oprah is just more for trying to Americanize and already great series!
0385504225|3.0|This is the third Dan Brown book featuring the symbologist Robert Langdon.  In this novel, Robert is tricked into going to Washington, DC, and is in a race against time to solve a Masonic puzzle in order to save his friend's life.  Complicating the picture is his friend's sister, whose research involves the effects of the mind over matter and a strange, ritualistic villain. While I wanted to like this one as much as his previous 2 novels, I found that this one felt more formulaic and at times, predictable. I did find the puzzles and rituals surrounding the Masons to be intriguing but less satisfying than those in the previous 2 books. I found some of the plot twists to be quite unbelievable, bordering on ridiculous.  All in all, I found this to be a decent page turner, but not a book that I could rave about to anyone.
B0022H3KTW|5.0|Loved the book.  It was a can't put it down experience.  Have read 4 of Sophie Kinsella's books and found them all to be wonderful!  Purchased four books from one Amazon vendor and received only 2.   Amazon refunded the entire cost and I kept the two books. Need to order the two that did not arrive now...  Remember Me? and Can You Keep a Secret?    Have read & recommend Shopaholic ties the Knot,  Confessions of a Shopaholic, The Undomestic Goddess and Shopaholic takes Manhattan.   I want to read all of the books she has written and those yet to come.  Shopaholic Ties the know was the first Sophie Kinsella book for me..... a used gift from a friend who had finished reading it.
0316077054|5.0|Here is what I love in Beautiful Darkness, even more than I liked it in Beautiful Creatures:  you are following the characters' emotional life even more than the turns in their fantastic world. The magic is great yes, and that is important, but you really experience it with the characters: the dilemnas, and the highs and lows, the agony of trying to get through it all. Garcia and Stohl can really write - and it makes a difference.  This isn't just white-skinned creatures with fangs jumping around. 9 times out of 10 \\"follow up\\" books are dissappointing and I loose interest in the whole series. That isn't true with Beautiful Darkness.  I think Garcia and Stohl (and their characters) were taking baby steps with \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" and have hit their stride in \\"Beautiful Darkness\\".  I am looking forward to seeing where they go next.

B0047FY6V8|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite episodes of the entire Smallville Epic. I've been a Smallville fan since 2005 and own every season. I was hit off guard to see the return of Brainiac from season 5 and the role he plays in opening up Clarks eyes in this episode. It was also a great idea for the Smallville High School Reunion and the flashbacks from the past. This episode was filled with fun and i enjoyed every minute.

0765315246|3.0|Some summer blockbuster movies are well-known to be \\"check-your-brain-in-at-the-door\\" type adventures. It has a compelling plot. The action is there. But afterward, you find that the characterization was a bit thin and cliched and/or you discover some plot holes.      Such is John Scalzi's novel Old Man's War.      Now don't get me wrong. It WAS an enjoyable read. The man clearly has talent and I would be so lucky to produce such an enjoyable book. As many other reviewers have noted, Scalzi seemed to be at his best during the first third of the story. Revealing the premise and then following the character through the process of finding out how this rejuvenation to youth would occur. I, the reader, had a great time of discovery, along with the protaganist. This is where the first-person narrative really shined. The rest? Not so much. Suffice it to say, the aliens' motives of finding us \\"part of a balanced breakfast\\" or something to that effect and the one-inch high aliens were a bit much.      Now for the obvious plot hole. The premise of using old people on account of their life experience was totally negated by two points. Firstly, it was never used or exploited. Secondly, the very fact of having a second type of soldier introduced that was both emotionally undeveloped AND superior to the protaganist.       Again, the man has obvious talent and will no doubt go on to write and improve. And as I have yet to read the others in this universe, he probably already has. All this notwithstanding, I enjoyed it and will followup with The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I was very disappointed by the way Oprah narrated the movie, and now I found so many viewers think the same way. Why doesn't BBC keep it in a single version, the Attenborough version?

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I was a little dubious about the 405Cx, given the mixed reviews, and I briefly considered other models.  Main concerns seem to be the touchiness of the bezel and the complex operations.  Don't worry.  These issues are totally manageable, in my experience.  I found the watch accurate, easy to use, and incredibly useful.  I hadn't used a GPS watch or a heart-rate monitor before.  I think it's made a huge difference in my marathon training.  It's also really fun. Here's the lowdown:  -The bezel operation works fine--not so well when your fingers are sweaty or cold, but I generally set it and forget it during a run.  If I want to change the display, it's really not a problem to unlock the bezel and give a tap or two on the fly.  -To prevent inadvertent operation all you have to do is lock the bezel, which is super easy.  -It's accurate compared to my car GPS, and satellite pickup is very fast.  -The ANT+ Agent has been touchy once or twice (I use a Mac OS), but all you have to do is upload the data again; the Garmin Connect site has a really nice layout and user interface and tells me everything I need to know.  I can easily e-mail my workouts to my kids to brag about how far I ran!  -The virtual partner is a fun way to track your pace, but less helpful than just monitoring your actual pace against your target, which is also really easy to do on the watch.  -Battery life is great.  A 10 to 15 mile run usually consumes about 40 percent of the battery.  -The heart rate monitor is really comfortable and has added a new dimension to my training.      To me, the additional features of the 405CX justified the price premium relative to the other Garmin models.  It's a terrific device.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This is a great read, way better than my expectations.  It is symbolic and really get you thinking about the issues we are facing in the society.  It is so good that I can't put it down, I finished it in one day.  Try the book, you'll be suprised by the beautiful writing and amazing plot line.
0439023491|5.0|i inhaled these books with an unsettling fury! luckily i bought them before i started school or else they would have seriously interfered. i am obsessed with this story line and writing style of suzanne collins! the last 50 pages of the final book destroyed me!! in a good way...but ya i was sobbing! the whole series is so good i can't praise it enough. i had a funny encounter with a lady at my work, she was purchasing something and set this book down on the counter i merely pointed and exclaimed \\"OH!\\" and she replied with \\"oh my god!\\" \\"i know right?!\\" \\"so good\\"...and that about sums it all up
B0043JEA14|4.0|There are some albums that just make you smile when you listen to them. This was one of them for me, much like Mike Daughty's \\"Haughty Melodic\\" or pretty much any Mavericks album. I absolutely understand the reviewer who balked  when the first thing he heard were the steel drums, but for those people that enjoy \\"Best of the Doobies\\" type Doobies,  this is a very satisfactory album.<br /><br />I found family members spontaneously dancing and enjoying themselves tremendously while this played. It has a very nice groove that is maintained through songs like \\"My Baby\\" and  \\"Nobody.\\" Many of the tunes hark back to the most accessible of the Doobies' works ( just watch the marvelous video for Nobody, which overlays vintage concert film with their present day appearance).<br /><br />I can forgive the atrocious Santana ripoff for the smiles we've gotten from the rest of the album.

193413712X|4.0|Very strange. Focus on prose descriptions of details of various New England environments, almost a stream of consciousness from the view of those dying or reflecting on the dying of Howard, Howard's father, and George (Howard's son). We note the smells or lack thereof, the flowers, to room arrangements, dust, and spend hours sitting in ponds wondering about Indians. Two wonderful tidbits for me included visits with a hermit and the gradual disappearance of a minister who clearly entered the world of books.
B0043CO7WI|4.0|I've been a Maroon 5 fan since Songs about Jane. I went to see then when they were not that popular and damn, they put on one of the best shows I have ever seen. I am happy that I got to see them at such an intimate setting. Hands All Over is definitely Maroon 5. You will not mistake this for anything else in your collection. There are some catchy tunes and some not so catchy tunes. I am definitely glad I bought it to add to my collection. I will definitely have it in my playlist for a long time to come. I just did not find anything super new or exciting about this album that really grabbed me. It is worth a buy if you are a hard core fan though.
B00005JMYI|3.0|if not for christina applegate starring in this film, it would have tanked!!!  this film took 1hr 7min 19sec to kick-in with the real laughter, otherwise this to me is nothing more than a revised/remake of romano vanderbees 1985 raunch classic   \\"sex o'clock news\\" which itself is 100% hellarious.    this extended unrated version of anchorman:the legend of ron burgundy is a cackle  rather than a belly-laugh of a comedy.    the script is (1970's) junior high school level at best and a soft r-rated for unrated and widescreen. there was supposed to be a sequel to this film which never got off the ground.    again, if not for actress chritina applegate starring in this not-so-funny comedy  i would not have even cared and only because will ferrell's other film \\"old school\\"  was nothing more than a watered-down remake of jim belushi's classic comedy masterpiece \\"national lampoons animal house\\" which is a whole lot funnier and very much better.    though i own my copy of this film, i will only play it for those whom i deem unworthy to watch sex o'clock news with me.    only if you cannot find a copy (on vhs) of sex o'clock news, should you \\"settle\\"  for this juvenile-insecure-news-boy level comedy. though 1 line did make me laugh very hard, what veronica corningstone wrote as a joke to mock ron burgundy concerening the california city of san diego.<<<GFD I cannot stand this city!!    anchorman has too much bark and not nearly enough bite!!     at least APPLEGATE saved it!!!! and made it just funny enough to own for an applegate keepsake film.
B002VECLVO|5.0|A Single Man is much like an art house film. It was released last year and written and directed by designer, and former Gucci creative director, Tom Ford. This is a very quiet and moving film that shows isolation, loneliness and loss of love. A Single Man takes place in November 1962, and is about an English professor who, after the sudden, shocking death of his partner and lover, goes about his typical day in Los Angeles. Colin Firth, who plays Professor George Falconer, shines in this role, and after seeing him in many movies, I must say this is his best acting to date. And apparently most of the movie industry agreed. For this role, Colin was nominated for his first Oscar in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, as well as The Golden Globes and went on  to win Best Actor for the BAFTAS, London Critics Circle Film among many others. Also, A Single Man was nominated for outstanding film at the GLAAD Media Awards.<br /><br />Tom Ford has excelled as a first time movie director with A Single Man. Not only relying on the masterful acting of Colin Firth, and Julianne Moore, as Charley, a middle-aged, rich drunken divorcee, but Tom sets up a scene, much like Orson Welles would do, where the audience must soak up every single frame to get the full effect of the range of emotions from his actors. Not many directors will allow many close ups and keep the camera still for almost a minute, where we just watch the actor's face. But Tom has done this here. Just by watching the range of emotions on Colin Firth's face as he remembers his dead lover of over twenty years, you feel such a connection to this man, and the harsh realities one must experience when that one person they love beyond all else is no longer in their lives.<br /><br />George is not only depressed, but empty inside. His will to live has vanished. The reason is because one snowy night, eight months ago, his one true love, Jim (played by Matthew Goode), was in a car accident. Jim died along with his and George's two beloved dogs. George found this out from a phone call from a member of Jim's family. George was not invited to the funeral, nor was he called right away when the accident happened. We are led to believe that Jim's family possibly didn't agree with Jim's lifestyle and his relationship with George. After George ends the phone call, he sits there is shock, then in grief and finally breaks down. The amazing range of emotion on George's face, thanks to the acting skill of Colin is superb, and you feel his heartbreak alongside him.<br /><br />George can't get passed Jim's death, and because of that, he decides on a specific course of action one sunny day that will end with a possible shocking outcome when all is said and done. Every action and thought of George's revolves around what he used to have with Jim. We see through flashbacks how he and Jim met, their days together how they would just sit on the couch and read or chat, while Jim smiles in his playful manner, coaxing a loving response from George.<br /><br />But although George feels he has nothing left to live for, on this very special day, he begins to notice that perhaps his life is not all that bad. He has a wonderful, loving friend with Charley, who he has known more than half his life. Even one of his students, Kenny (played by Nicholas Hoult) sees something special in George, and is more than willing to help George heal. It's all up to George to decide what his next step is, and if he's willing not to give up and embrace those around him who can give him as much love and happiness he once had with Jim.<br /><br />The title- A Single Man is perfect in describing who George is. For a very long time, George wasn't single. He was connected to another person, where the two halves of their soul became one entity. George and Jim were each other's soul mates in every sense. Now George must find his identity again. The start of the film shows George barely going through the daily motions, and as the story progresses, he begins to come back to life. This is shown perfectly with color. When George is depressed or reliving his pain, everything is muted and dull. But when he smiles or enjoys something as simple as a conversation, everything around him becomes brighter with color in very much the literal sense.<br /><br />Not many actors can play a character like George. A Single Man is more of a character piece, an analysis, a one man show into a person's emotional psyche. Colin Firth plays George to near perfection. His loyalty and dedication to his dead lover, even when he has the opportunity to enjoy physical relations with other men, is moving. He won't give into his need for release because of his dedication to Jim.<br /><br />A Single Man is very much a romance and shows how love can free a person. We see this between George and Charley, whose long lasting friendship is one we all wish we could have with another person. George's student, Kenny is full of innocence and has a near puppy like crush on George that never crosses an uncomfortable line. And then finally there is Jim, the ghost from George's past that he must let go so he can move on. And when George finally decides to let Jim go, it is very heartbreaking, as well as peaceful.<br /><br />This is one movie that is very visually stunning, with awe inspiring acting. If you have a chance, please do view A Single Man. It's a true piece of art from a new visionary and with actors, such as Colin Firth and Julianne Moore, who are two of the best movie actors of this century.<br /><br />Katiebabsback to life.

B003YWUTKM|1.0|I bought this album as a present to myself for my birthday, and all I can say is Really Dave? Anyone expecting to hear David Gilmour in all his majestic display of guitar playing(and singing for that matter) will be sorely disappointed. Upon reading the inner liner notes, one finds that this is some sort of fundraiser for someone named Gary McKinnon. Pardon my ignorance, but I have no idea who this cat may be, and perhaps people should be forwarned of just what they are contributing their hard-earned money to. As for the music itself, even though I live in rural north-east Texas, I have been listening to progressive rock since its' inception, including bands like Tangerine Dream; the Orb seems to me to be a knock-off of this ambient, synthesized trance-dance style of (music?). They could have gotten Joe Blow off the streets to play the guitar on this one...or just edited in some Gilmour riffs...and as far as using snippets of a Grahm Nash song(Chicago/Change the world)to me,it just adds to the over-all unsavory taste of mixing political views and music. Perhaps if you get this disc before Halloween, you can use it as background \\"noise\\" for your Fright-Night party...or maybe a drink coaster. I love you Dave, but Seriously?
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|Red is a pretty fun ride from start to finish. It features a great cast, including Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Mary-Louise Parker, Richard Dreyfuss, Ernest Borgnine, Brian Cox and Karl Urban. The Expendables is another movie that came out this year with a huge cast, but I never would have thought that these older folks would make for a better action movie.<br /><br />The humor, which works a little over 50% of the time, and the strong cast are what really makes Red tick. Some of the action scenes are interesting, like when Bruce Willis gets out of a moving car and starts shooting without missing a beat, while others are rather bland. The story felt flat and simple, yet at the same time, all over the place. Still, there is no doubt that for an early fall release, Red proves itself better than most of the average films I've seen this summer.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Very good series, already have the second one on the way. It ties in between star wars 2 and 3 and is just as good as the Star wars sagas!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I'm not going to refer to any reviews left by others.  It get's annoying reading reviews by people that have never seen a movie, or just review badly because there's either an actor they hate or because of the type of movie it is.  I know people that hate buddy cop movies, or action movies where most of the expense went into blanks, squibs, pyrotechnics.  In my opinion I REALLY enjoyed this movie.  It was also nice to see my favorite actors from then and favorites actors from now, including the nice appearance of Charisma Carpenter that played Cordelia Chase from TV's Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel.  And she still looks good.  If anything I think these are one of those movies that ended too soon.  I could have gone for another half hour.  Granted there could have been more dialog in some places, but when it comes to action.. Things come down to business.  Nice acting, nice hand to hand or hand to gun combat. LOL  Those moves that were pulled in this movie were even better than the fighting I liked in Equilibrium. (Another nice movie.)  And that automatic shotgun Terry Crews had... OMFG, that was the most insane destruction I've seen made by a hand held gun in quit awhile.  If Stallone is planning a sequel I hope to hell he has everyone back.  Maybe make the next one closer to 2 hours and have the action cover 3 different countries.  One covered by jungle, one desert, and one in an arctic like terrain. Think I am going to get this for myself as an early Christmas gift...

B004498KPU|5.0|I'd like to order this in Canada, but Canadian Amazon still does it not have this amazing box set even listed for order! Amazon UK has disabled its site for MICHAEL JACKSON'S VISION box set pre-orders.  What seems to be the problem?  Very odd developments....    Regardless of what Oprah says or does, she won't change the minds of people who think Michael is \\"guilty\\" - they are stubborn mules.  Eventually these old mules will die off, and the future generations will discover the genius of Michael Jackson - they won't give a tinkers damn about some ancient allegations 40 years before!  Take Charlie Chaplin for example. Chaplin faced all kinds of controversies and scandals in his life, but is this remembered today?  The straight answer is \\"no\\", Charlie Chaplin is remembered as a comedic genius...  History will be far kinder to Michael than his contemporaries were... and his artistic genius will be his gift to humanity which will grow in strength in the coming decades...  So relax, Michael's legacy will continue to thrive.... What Oprah thinks or does will not even be a ripple in a pond in the eyes of time...

B000024KC2|5.0|Easily one of my all-time favorite records, Whitesnake's `Slide It In' has an interesting history as it was released in two separate versions within months of each other in 1984; one for European audiences (issued first) and then a remixed and partially rerecorded American version (which was their Geffen records debut). The US one is the LP I fell in love with but the differences between this one and the original release are subtle but profound just the same. John Sykes recorded some leads and the guitar sounds featured more echo with less sonic emphasis on the keyboards.  The order of the songs is also different and I don't think that matters as much as except for maybe the last two songs on the Euro LP are \\"Hungry for Love\\" and \\"Guilty of Love\\" which are good not great songs. My favorites are the obvious hits that first brought Whitesnake US notice - \\"Slow and Easy\\", \\"Love Ain't No Stranger\\" and the title track.  All three are classy hard rock classics that despite the Led Zeppelin rip-off accusations of the first were more in keeping of the great British blues rock tradition that inspired countless bands. The mood and dynamics along with the amazing performances of Cozy Powell and David Coverdale make these songs the best of what made Whitesnake such a great band. Other notable tracks include \\"Give Me More Time\\" and album opener \\"Gambler\\" which seemed buried on the American version but stands out proud as a taste of greatness to come. Although the band finally had this American success, the wheels would soon be put in motion for an overhaul that would pave the way for massive success but also lose a certain coolness that made the band so special to many.

0316010669|4.0|This book could have been 200 pages, but instead, as modern authors seem to do, Gladwell felt compelled to make it much longer than it needed to be.  This really is a good book, but Gladwell was on the verge of a great book.  He provides an interesting topic with great commentary and thought.  He ruins it with 2 things: 1) the unnecessary length 2) he doesn't go into \\"why\\" thin slicing is from a neuro-psychological standpoint.  Effectivel, he tells us \\"this\\" is the case and gives some evidence ot support his claim.  If you are going to this kind of commentary, write an article, no a book.<br /><br />If it sounds as though my opinion is mixed, it is.  This book could have been truely phenomenal, but the books failings have me thinking of giving it 3 stars.  More detail was necessary for some of the great examples he gave, and all of the uselessm uninformative chatter between points needs cutting out.
B003HKN52A|4.0|I had this movie on vhs back in the say when they used to release the elvis collections. i believe it was like five movies per box. Anyway it's been forever since I've seen it as I sold my vhs collection to start buying dvds. The Blu Ray Transfer is great, it seems like they did the best they could with what they had. Though, I will add that it seems with Elvis material they tend to take better care of archival stuff than with others from that time frame. Only drawback with this dvd is that it has no extras. They could have thrown in say a look back on the film including the people who worked on it (who are still with us) commenting on it. But, oh well. It's still Elvis. Some have said that this isn't their favorite performance movie/dvd. I agree with that, however, if put into perspective this isn't really like a live concert. While you get some live performances, that look great on blu ray (I have not seen the recently released dvd version of this so I can't really say what the differences are between the two, I only have my VHS memories) Everything looks great, the sound is great. What I do like (and this is also why I buy special editions of Elvis cd's that include studio chatter/alternate versions) Is that you get a feel of what Elvis was like as a person. You get to see him briefly working in the studio (I always have wondered if they ever extensively recorded him live in the studio and if so if we'll ever see it on dvd) It's always nice to see behind the scenes stuff, as it always gives you a better glimpse into who the man was. Elvis is an Icon, almost a Myth, but it's in scenes that are showcased here, and in other releases that show Elvis the person, his shyness, his humbleness. Though I do wish they included some kind of extras, the book they included was really nice, the blu ray is set up as a book anyway. It's very nice overall, the packaging and pictures were a great add-on. Maybe that was to make up for the lack of dvd extras? I want to own all of elvis's movies. and as much of the other specials as I can. I already own the deluxed edition (3dvds) of the '68 Comeback Special. That I give five stars..totally packed with extras) So I would have bought this dvd regardless, but it's nice that at least with the feature presentation they took time to release a great product. Definitely would recommend it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is like the better version of Harry Potter. I say that people should read this book because it amazing and loveable for everyone. It always leaves you wondering what will happen to the characters also what type of events will occur in the next book. In this book i must say that Rick Riordan really outstanded me woth this book and makes me want to get the next book that comes out really bad.
B000G03RJA|5.0|Great Collection, I loved the songs I heard in the 80s and didn't realise what I had been missing out on until I purchased this cd. There is a lot of good music here. I am not an expert on her work so I can not comment on what should have been included here (and wasn't) or things that were included here that shouldn't have been, all I do know is that I am now interested in finding some of her albums so I can see what I've been missing out on.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|The sound quality is superb, every bit as good as advertised. My problem was with the battery life. It was recommended to me that I used it while it's plugged into my USB, but that simply causes too much static. The best way to use these are to run them on the battery, but it's life is too short. I didn't time it, but it's not nearly as long as the batter life for the ipod it's attached to. This creates an obvious inconvenience.
B002OLUPYO|5.0|this one had bonus tracks/videos. Pink is an underrated talent, not that anyone really speaks bad about her, but it seems in this day and age of pre-assembled crap, that someone who not only does live shows, but doesn't lip synch while doing so, should be publicized a lot more. Granted none of that would matter, if the songs weren't any good. Well rest assured with Pink you never have to worry about that. her writing is very personal and spirited, each song well crafted, she actually cares about the product she is putting out. and her live shows/videos are always fun to watch. Though to be honest it is hard for me to listen to \\"please don't leave me\\" especially coming from someone like Pink, it seems that she bared her soul on this one, and it really speaks to me and really gets to me. Pink's always been rather tough, someone who it would seem would be fun/dangerous to fight with. So I guess with her being so emotional on this song, it just carries more weight. That being said, I would definitely recommend this cd, also I'd like to recommend you get the funhouse tour which has the cd/dvd of her live in Australia. Great addition to this purchase. Great addition to any collection.
1416575464|5.0|This book is great for if you just move into a house, or already have the house you want but want ideas for how to add little touches or extra and its great ideas for storage.   Its got things sectioned out and its easy to follow.   I had never even heard of the magazines, but came across this book in anthropology and filmed through it and then decided to buy it....  I really like it and its great to go back to again and again
B002YE452Y|5.0|and fortunatley not only do you get to listen to hear new album (with bonus tracks) you get to see her on the included dvd. I'm not trying to obejctitfy her but she is very beautiful, and I am just an honest healthy male, but that wouldn't matter if she didn't have the talent needed for me to buy the cd. I can always find pictures of her lol, but for me it's about the music, and she definitely is talented in that area. and her dance moves could put even britney to shame (though I am tired of people comparing her to britney, they are totally different people) One thing I do not like (and this isn't aimed at Shakira) is the trend to release a cd and then shortly afterwards come out with a deluxe edition. With this album I actually learned to wait. I knew there would be a deluxe edition, just like with Pink. I now know to wait.It's getting so that a person can't enjoy an album on the first day of release, if we buy it we'll get burned, so we have to wait, if artists/music labels were smart they would release them on the same day.  i'd rather pay a few more dollars to buy the deluxe edition than pay for the initial release only to find there is a better version coming out. i feel that record copanies are trying to cheat me out of hard earned money. But, that aside, Sharkira is worth the price of this cd/dvd combo. You can't go wrong with this purchase. Though I just want to add, what is her obsession with Matt Damon? First Ben now Shakira. I'd definitely recommend this purchase. I am very happy with mine (I also collect cds, so this is a welcome addition to my collection, I want to someday pass on my collection, after I'm gone, and to me my record collection will represent me as a person, both what kind of person I am as well as the kind of music I loved...and in the end it's the music that matters, so if you love music, then I recommend you buying this.
0891416811|5.0|Excellent, excellent book on the 101st Airborne Division and their exploits during WWII.  Brilliantly written and fantastically described by one who was actually there!
B0000640VM|5.0|I watched this Movie when I was 13 yrs old now Im 24 and its still very entertaining. I purchased it for my 2 yr old daughter & she loves the dogs & the songs they sing.
0061714372|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It's a brutally honest and well written book that gives you a different not so glamorous look at the rock and roll life style.
B002OB9KPE|2.0|...what happens is an endless repetition of verses, pre-verses, choruses and bridges. Lets play this bridge 8 times in a row so I can show you how many ways it can be played on the drums. Please. I am a big DT fan and Transatlantic fan too (see my other reviews) but this issue of their work gives me a perceived silent conflict of Egos. I believe Mike has some kind of urgency to be the louder voice, or to try to prove himself to the world, I really don't know what's up with the man. I am a drummer, and I can play DT songs fine, but please... can you play for the song and not for the Ego? Don't take me wrong, the performances are top notch. The songs aren't. Mike, you need to relax. You already have your spot in the drumming world as one of the greats. Now it's time to play for the song. Less \\"me\\", more \\"we\\".
142311339X|4.0|I have to say this book never gave me the chance to put it down! Right from the start, having never read the main series or anything else from Rick Riordan, this book pulled me in. It's easy style and its very realistic characters are a treat. I was surprised to see the amount of romance that this book had, especially when you consider that this is YA and it is supposed to be an action story. But that doesn't mean it was too much, rather, it was quite accurate considering the ages of the characters and their personalities. The shifting narrative from each character's perspective was also very nice so that you essentially get three points of view for the entire story giving it much more complexity and realism . Any of the characters is worth his/her own series because they are really, really good and complex.    You have the amnesiac uber-warrior/natural leader Jason, whose loss of memory has shaken him and makes him unsure. You have the lonely/insecure girl whose desperately seeking acceptance and you have the witty and annoying mechanical genius whose uses humor to hide behind his own insecurities. The story not only takes these characters through the wide and epic world that Rick Riordan has crafted for Percy Jackson and the Olympians but also takes them through their own emotional insecurities and makes them accept their fates and find themselves.     The only thing I disliked about the book and this is something most people dislike about a book their really love, is the torturous wait till the next book in this series is released. However, till then, I've already got my hands on the Percy Jackson series and, if they are anything as good as The Lost Hero, I'll still be looking at close to 11 months of waiting!
0312600844|1.0|This book was a profound disappointment, especially after all the advance press. There is not a single sympathetic or even merely likable character in all its bloated 500-plus pages. The writing is often slipshod; the editing is disgraceful; and Franzen too often uses his story as a platform for his own politics (nothing wrong with that, but must he be so obvious?) Still, \\"Freedom\\" deserves a special award for some of the most off-putting sex scenes in modern literature.    As a great admirer of \\"The Corrections\\" (read it twice), I was totally bummed that I spent $14 on this thing.    I simply wonder how much self-loathing lies behind such a sisyphean effort.
0060899220|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is profane, but delightfully amusing. Kitchen Confidential was downloaded to our Kindle as we traveled near the Bonneville, Utah salt flats, after we had read in an Omaha newspaper that he was appearing there. We read it to each other as we drove to California. It's a literary main dish for a \\"foodie\\".
B0041VT6H2|3.0|There was room for so much more movie here. The look, the feel, of the movie was right and the actors did a good job with what they had. But one hour and twenty minutes? I don't know how much ended up on the cutting room floor, but this movie needed more STORY, more detail, to make it whole. One of the best scenes in the movie was the resurrection of Zeb and his history with Jonah. There was room for more detail about Jonah. Room for more detail about Zeb. And it was not there. Was the plan to get it to commercial television(40 minutes of built in room for ads)? I understand the reasoning behind the two hour movie but I watch movies at home, not in the theater. Give me a good story, don't work with the thought process of a time constraint, even if it means the movie is three hours or more(if I have to hit pause, I can). All that being said, I enjoyed this movie. I just wish it had more content.
B002VECM72|5.0|The best movie I've seen in a long time; it really shows you that if you have the means and you're not stuck on yourself you can do great things to open up doors for the less fortunate.
0061433047|2.0|I loved the sweet budding romance between Tiffany the witch and the shy Roland and this book was a big disappointment when Roland ended up marrying someone else. I understand that Pratchett doesn't subscribe to the typical fairy tale endings, but just like Carrot and Angua, Vimes and Lady Sybil, Tiffany and Roland belonged together and to break them apart seemed more forced and un-natural than if they had ended up together.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|Watched whole first season and I knew I wanted more of it. I bought it on Amazon.com and still have not found a cheaper price any place else. What can I say other than a perfect 10+
B000002P2W|4.0|Not a great album but one that is pleasing to listen to nonetheless.<br />Has big hit \\"Squeeze Box\\" on it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I love this new portable recorder.  It's easy to use and produces a really professional style recording.  The portability is the best feature and it's simplicity of use.  Great product.
B000001DQG|3.0|This is an okay album by Elton John, not great, but some nice music on it.  Does not challenge Honky Chateau or Goodbye YBR.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I love action and adventure films and this is as good as the best in this genre. It is fun, exciting, the sets are amazing, the parkour fantastic and most of all Jake Gyllenhal is soooo hot. He is one of my favorite actors, very skillful and normally in deeper more serious roles, so it is clear this one was easy for him. He looks so fit, muscled and lean in this movie and best of all you can tell that he just had a blast making it. In fact everything about this movie screams fun. Clearly, aside from the extras marching in the 125 degree Moroccan desert heat, it appears that everyone involved was caught up in the magic of a wonderful tale wonderfully done. It is not deep but it has a good message, and while there is a lovely romantic story it is not the only story of love. Familial love and love of one's country and culture are also important. The special effects are good too and used sparingly as needed so this is not a CGI movie. In fact the fact that Jake did most of his stunts and Gemma did a lot of hers and that they didn't CGI the parkour makes it a lot better to watch. I really don't like movies where they have to hide the actors face all the time to cover up the stunt double or where the actor leaps from a building and becomes a cartoon character. This has a great story, gorgeous costumes and sets and an excellent cast. Ben Kingsley is a superb actor, slightly wasted in a limited role, but still an asset. I highly recommend this film, it is very enjoyable to watch and will be one of a select few that I watch more than once. I would go into more detail about the film but I feel this is one that was so much fun to watch not knowing anything about the story. Give it a chance you won't be disappointed.
B000002P2V|5.0|This is one of the best rock and roll albums ever made.  The Who were at their peak.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|This is the album that pretty much cemented Robin Trower's place in music history. An instant classic. From start to finish every track is a winner and amongst his best-known material that which he still plays in concert to this very day. A must for guitar players and casual listeners alike. Trower is heavily infuenced by Jimi Hendrix for those who don't know and while it is somewhat derivative there is still a great deal of originality here. The vocals are first rate supplied by James Dewar, easily one of the most recognized and respected singers of this genre.<br />This is a classic hard rock album and one that you won't regret owning.<br />I've hadthis album on vinyl, on 8 track and now on cd and it never gets old.
B000001EGA|5.0|After reading all the customer reviews of this CD I have nothing to add.  It is a great album from a great artist.
0486437507|5.0|I owned this book a long time ago -- and may buy myself another copy.  The other reviews here give good opinions and recommend various stories and chapters in this book -- but do not seem to say what this book is ALL ABOUT.  For those who have never heard of this classic, here is a summary of the book's plot.  \\"The King In Yellow\\" is about a book, (called \\"The King In Yellow\\"), that drives people insane, or nearly insane, when they read it.  The various chapters detail what happens to various people when they read this book.    It is a masterpiece, but must be read carefully and slowly.  Do read it.  Your patience will be rewarded!
B000002P6R|4.0|Another Who album after the death of Keith Moon.  Not spectacular, but a very good CD.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book has flawlessly portrayed characters, surprises on each page you turn, and the power to make you learn about the histoy of Greece and the exciting myths associated in it. If you haven't read this book then you are missing out on some of the greatest stories the world has known and new, exciting stories that will soon be discovered by kids, teens, and adults alike.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I loved \\"Shinedown\\" since I first heard its \\"45,\\" but haven't listened to the band until my friend played it in his car. That song was \\"If You Only Knew\\" and it was so meaningful I couldn't wait to get the album. I got the album just for that one song, but it turned out that all songs are very deep and moving. Every song is filled with outreach and I thank \\"Shinedown\\" and everyone who was involved in creating \\"The Sound of Madness,\\" truly a Beautiful work.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I see lots of technical mumbo-jumbo in previous reviews regarding the electrical characteristics and whether it is what is advertised - BTW, I am an electrical design engineer so I understand the mumbo-jumbo quite well. The cable is a perfectly serviceable hdmi cable that is reasonably priced and will work fine for 100% of the users who buy it. There will be some who will complaing because they have nothing better to do than waste their time creating confusion around what is and should be a very simple decision.    Buy the cable, you will like it and it will work as well as a $50 version. You will not notice one iota of difference and you will save $40.
0385342039|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars if the ending would have been written a little differently. Without giving away the ending, I will just say that I have read and love ALL of Sophie Kinsella's novels, and this one started out a little different but OK, the middle is really good and lots of fun, but when I get to the end of a Sophie Kinsella novel, I want to be laughing and feel good, not crying my eyes out saying \\"Damn that Kinsella! Why did she do that!\\" I could have thought of a better ending than she gave this book.
0470876417|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I loved it from the first \\"thumb through\\".  The first chapter is dedicated to actually understanding the book, and creates a common \\"canvas\\" to organize ideas, audiences, resources, etc.  What I liked most about it was that it was written with a nod to the \\"visual thinking\\" movement, and is actually sensitive to the designer's point of view.  The case studies are real world, and happening today...not years ago which gives this book a very fresh look at this complex process.  True creativity is often about making the complex seem simple, and this book does just that.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|Was a good movie. Im a kevin zeggers fan. The movie had a good trailer and it made me think it was going to be more exciting, but what can you expect from a movie where there is only one seting. Over all it was a good movie and there where some brutal parts. But there was a lot of talk and not much action. A lot of the chick whineing. And i dont want to give away any of the movie but it should have been called eaten by wolves.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was interested in the thick lime green book I passed by. They say `curiosity killed the cat', but I plucked it off the shelf. The first thing I read when I open the book is, \\"Eighty percent of the women in Sweden have at one time been threatened by a man\\". That was a shocking amount, I thought to myself. Sill I turn another page, \\"Forty-six percent of the women in Sweden have been subjected to violence by a man\\".  A second thought came into my head, it's was possibly some important knowledge to the plot or maybe a just a fact that connected to the book. I would see of that after I read this, was my third and final thought of the lime-green book I took with me.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was written by a Swedish man named Stieg Larsson. The novel is about the mysterious disappearance of Harriet Vanger, a girl part of one of the wealthiest but also most cold-blooded former-Nazi family in Sweden. She disappeared forty years ago and her kind Uncle, former CEO of the Vanger Company, is convinced that a family member had murdered her. He finally decides to hire someone to close this case. A man that is being pushed down the drain and label as a fraud journalist that will be going to jail soon, Mikeal Blomkvist. Which is helped out by a Goth girl, with hundreds of cases of being sent to mental institution, but is a genius hacker, Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson, I believe was writing trust in between the lines of every page in the novel. That was the whole problem between the two who are trying to solve the case. Trust is the main concept of a team to actually reach their goal. Lisbeth and Mikeal are one of the most unlikely pair of people but trust had made these two into an incredible duo.<br /><br />I really enjoyed every time it switched to Lisbeth's point of view; you could say it was my favorite part of the novel. Sure Mikeal was an interesting person, but Lisbeth was a brilliant character. She became very real to me in a very short time reading about her. I started to agree with her every thought and action. Lisbeth made the plot expand even farther and twisted the situation into something inspected.<br /><br />I don't suggest, I would mostly likely advise anyone who is willing to give a few non-stop hours of their lives and a massive amount of information cramped into their head in a short time to read this book. I would though give a suggestion to those who like an unthought-of mystery, a tad bit of romance, some bloody revenge, and intelligent characters.<br /><br />This was a fantastic book and nothing should be change, plus that would make the author turn over in his grave. The characters are so realistic and unreal all at once. The plot was a maze that you eventually got to the end after millions of turns and twist, even after being ferociously tired still wanting more of it. The frighteningly suspenseful mystery of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was much more than a thriller full of big ideas. It is a story that undertakes issues of power, corruption, justice, and innocence; which has you gripping the novel in very beginning.I started to agree with her every thought and action.

B003EYVXSW|5.0|This movie was really good. It was shocking and freaky. You didnt know what was coming. Some parts made you turn your head and just say \\"did that really just happen?\\" This was a movie I could not take my eyes off of. On the edge of the seat the entier time. If your into syfi/horror movies you well love it.
0345509617|5.0|It is a wonderful book for film fans, and a must have for Star Wars fans.  It's big and loaded with facts and behind the scenes information and it goes well beyond just Empire.    Reprints many of Lucas notes as he was creating the story for all films.  The pictures are to die for, for fans as many depict the cast practicing and just hanging out.  Kind of details everything that transpired during the making of this film.
B0021L8V0W|1.0|The very first preview I saw of this movie lead me to think, they were trying too hard and did not have a developed to pull this off successfully. After watching it at a friends house...I was right. A lot of time is spent developing a backround and then bam there is a bunch of action, then an ending. Still not sure why agreed to watch it all.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Excellent book.  Ms Kearns Goodwin really brought the characters to life.  She lovingly portrayed the individuals for the people they were with their strengths and weaknesses.  It reinforced the powerful image of Abraham Lincoln, as the man he wanted to be and truly was.  The book has great detail and in the beginning, at times it may seem hard to follow the characters, but very much worth the time to read and finish.  A book worth going back to.
0316077054|5.0|I couldn't wait for the sequel to Beautiful Creatures, here it is, and I am ecstatic!!!  I don't usually like sequels and have often been disappointed, but with Beautiful Darkness, Margaret Stohl and Kami Garcia have done everything but disappoint! And then some......Fabulous! Thank you!
0525951652|1.0|I was disappointed in this book and genuinely happy when it ended...that it HAD finally ended.  I think it even made my Kindle heavier.      Where is all the heart of Pillars of the Earth?  Where is Ken Follett?  And two more of these are on the way?  Yikes!    If you are an insomniac read this book instead of taking Ambien.  If you are a Ken Follett fan, reread Pillars instead.
0205632645|5.0|This item was recieved MUCH quicker than was told or than I anticipated. The book arrived in absolute perfect condition and has been extremely helpful to me in my university class. I actually would have enjoyed the read even had it not been a college requirement, as it is definitely written very well. If your looking here you must have an interest, so do yourself a favor and pick one up. You won't regret it at all.
1439133948|2.0|Lightweight, and unable to carry the weight of the epilogue.    After reading Diplomatic Immunity, and Mirror Dance, as well as Paladin of Souls, it's clear that Bujold is struggling with her own sense of her own mortality--and not in a way that's to the advantage of the Vorkosigan series.    Two stars, instead of none, because Bujold is incapable of writing an uninvolving book.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I hope I could do the band Munford & Sons justice.  They have a multi sound from folk, bluegrass, harmony, barber shop, choir sound with rock that all works together.  Makes you feel you could be at a county fair or arena during a concert.  Could be compaired to Blue October combined with Kings of Leon.  They have an Irish/Scottish sound from London.  I think grandparents and teens would both have something in common and bonding time togther as they listen to them.  Each band memeber has a uniqeness that combined offers amazing harmony sounds.  The lyrics and music combined offer ballads that pull at the heartstrings and make you want to jump up and do a dance too.  Each song has their sound but has something different in each song.  I definatley will buy all of their music as it comes out.  Watching the video, they look like they sincerely like eachother and enjoy working with eachother.  I would definately recomned this if you like something different from the everyday artists that are out there.
0743289692|5.0|I was a reluctant reader of this book. My daughters both read it and they are very different in their political leanings and I didn't want to read it. But they bugged me then they got my wife to read it and she doesn't read a lot and read it in three days. Boom! Couldn't put it down. So I was sold. And the same thing happened to me except it is depressing at times and frightening other times and I took my time to let it soak in.<br /><br />This lady is an outstanding human being. One of the very special ones who has the courage of her convictions. It takes you in vivid detail from her life as a child in Somalia, she takes you inside the life of a woman in Islam. It is unbelievable in its honesty and stark truth of what and why we are struggling with Islam today.<br /><br />If you ever wanted an inside look at what it is like for a woman in Islam, the threats and mutilation, the beatings you name it. She exposes it here. This is a history lesson of not a woman scorned or whining, she went on to become a member of Dutch Parliament in an effort to expose the life of Muslim women and why we are facing this battle today.<br /><br />I could go on and on but this is the real deal, in vivid detail and brings you right up to today and not in just Somalia, but her life in Ethopia and Saudi Arabia and even in Holland and the far reaches of her clan to get her. Great story, great woman and a great read!
0316077054|5.0|I really like this book. At first I tried to restrict myself to reading 1-2 chapters every night but I ended up reading for 2 days when I had free time. I couldn't stop reading it.
0525951652|5.0|I thought this was an excellent book. In spite of the fact that it's so long, it is highly readable.    One reason I liked it was that I learned so much about WWI. I know it's fiction but the setting is real. I am also a big fan of books set in WWII and it was interesting to see the same countries in the first war. I was also interested in learning about the Russian Revolution and the beginnings of communism. I was surprised that Follett spent so much time on the Revolution, but at the same time I could see how it affected WWI.     Unless you just don't like 1,000 page books, I highly recommend this one. The characters, the setting, the plot - I give it five stars. I was surprised at some of the other reviews because I don't see what the cost of a Kindle book has to do with the quality of the book.
0307269752|5.0|The book is one of the best I have ever read.  There is a lot more going on in this story than your normal spy thriller book.

I've tried making the cake pops before the book only to have my candy coating be too thick (even after I added oil).   Now with the book - she includes the secret ingredient to getting the candy melt consistency nice & smooth.      We made pops tonight with ages 4, 6, 9 and me and we posted a pic on this site.  Had such fun and now we're left with a few pops.      My kids are not big fans of cupcakes with the huge heapings of super sweet frosting but these little cake pops are perfect for their consumption - and it helps that they are so cute.   Rather than mixing the cake with frosting, I mix in room temperature cream cheese - 'cause I LOVE cream cheese and it's also not as sweet as frosting.  Remember the candy melts are sweet too.   You can also use Oreo crumbs instead of cake - it's a total winner if you are an oreo fan and there's no baking involved.      Find a cake decorating supply place near you and purchase good quality candy melts (Merckens). They're the same price as Wiltons.   The Wiltons taste bland whereas you could snack on the Merckens ones.     I just received the Bakerella book 5 days ago and my kids and I have gone through it so many times already.  They think I bought it for them. haha.      The photographs are beautiful and Bakerella makes those cake pops look perfect.  The book lists the type of topping/sprinkle used which wasn't consistently available in the blog.   Most everything in the book looks do-able for the a person with no cake decorating experience, the challenge is getting the right type of sprinkles.    I took off a point because so many of the cake pops were already in her blog.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love this album, but it is easy to understand why some people hate it. The hype surrounding Susan Boyle meant that a lot of people heard her music who just aren't into this kind of music. At the time, a lot of people thought that Susan would be a one-album wonder, but this has proved to be not so. As a huge fan of Christmas music, I'm looking forward to her follow-up album. Wild horses made the top ten in the UK singles chart and nearly made the top ten in Ireland, but elsewhere it was only a minor hit. The title track was also released as a single in various countries, but as far as I know, it wasn't a huge hit anywhere. However, the album sold millions so the comparative failure of the singles didn't matter.<br /><br />This set opens with Wild horses, a slowed-down re-interpretation of a Rolling Stones song. I read somewhere that another singer has previously re-interpreted this song in exactly this way, but I haven't heard that version although I am of course familiar with the original. I also suspect that the vast majority of people have not heard this interpretation of Wild horses by anybody else. It works brilliantly, but it's worth noting that Petula Clark (I want to hold your hand - the Beatles), Jackie Trent (It's not unusual - Tom Jones) and Alison Krauss (Baby now that I've found you - Foundations) are among the many singers who have taken sixties pop classics and completely re-interpreted them by slowing them right down. All of those versions are brilliant too, yet none of them take anything away from the originals. Truly great songs can be interpreted in different ways and still sound great.<br /><br />The only original song here, Who I was born to be, although not written by Susan, appears to be inspired by her story. Elsewhere, the songs are diverse in character including musicals (I dreamed a dream, from Les Miserables), fifties pop (Cry me a river, originally by Julie London), gospel (How great thou art, Amazing grace), You'll see (nineties pop, originally by Madonna), sixties pop (Daydream believer (a hit for the Monkees), Up to the mountain (contemporary folk-country, written and first recorded by Patty Griffin - another song that could be about Susan), Prod (from the ITV musical drama Britannia high), End of the world (sixties pop-country) and Silent night (Christmas). Susan performs all these songs superbly.<br /><br />I doubt that Susan will ever match the success of this album, but the quality of it suggests that she could be around for a while yet. Of course it isn't to everybody's liking. If you are looking for music that rocks, look elsewhere. This is easy listening music at its best and doesn't pretend to be anything else.onna), sixties pop (Daydream believer (a hit for the Monkees), Up to the mountain (contemporary folk-country, written and first recorded by Patty Griffin - another song that could be about Susan), Prod (from the ITV musical drama Britannia high), End of the world (sixties pop-country) and Silent night (Christmas).

B0034G4P7G|5.0|The Social Network is a classical tale of power and revenge. It begins in 2003 at Harvard, where undergraduate Mark Zuckerberg invents the vast social networking website Facebook. Director David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en) intersperses Mark's upward trajectory with scenes from two lawsuits against him, one from his friend and co-founder Eduardo Saverin and one from classmates Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.    Aaron Sorkin, also a playwright, adapted this outstanding script from Ben Mezrich's mostly true book The Accidental Billionares. Language is as central to this film as it is to any play. Conversations are the equivalent of car chases. In spite of its cleverness, the dialogue remains remarkably natural.    The fast talk is aided by snappy editing and pumping music, which sometimes turns as ominous as the darkly lit Harvard campus. Even glamorized scenes of elite parties are shot in somber tones. Further visual ingenuity is evinced in one scene in which the camera makes the world of a rowing race look like a perfect toyland. This athletic struggle mimics the characters' overarching business battles.    Impeccably cast, The Social Network is also a fascinating character study. Played by Jesse Eisenberg, Mark's intelligence and drive dominate the story. So brilliant he occasionally comes across as an evil genius, Mark is lonely, self-centered, and contemptuous. (His outfits consist of hoodies and sandals.) This protagonist's tragic flaws allow him everything but friendship.    The film is tilted towards Mark's former friend Eduardo (Andrew Garfield). While his decency and victimization are overemphasized, the character is quite believable and certainly sympathetic.    Also interesting are the amusing Winklevoss twins, played by Armie Hammer (thanks to incredible special effects). Tall and gorgeous, these Olympic class rowers resemble Olympians. They may be entitled, but their plight is understandable.    Even Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the creator of Napster and the man who seduces Mark into a larger life, comes across as more pathetic than villainous. Sean has surface charm and appreciates Facebook's potential, but he is at best unreliable and sophomoric.    Smaller parts are likewise well acted, including Mark's level headed and thus brief girlfriend (Rooney Mara) and the twins' furious friend Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). The only misstep is Rashida Jones as a (gorgeous) lawyer who is bizarrely compassionate to Mark, in an apparent attempt to make him more likable.    Certain aspects of the story are sexed up and simplified. Only the exclusive side of Harvard is explored. Most disturbing is that the characters on which The Social Network is based are still alive. Though mixing fact and fiction can be dubious, the creators of the film performed extensive research and invited everyone to give their input. Understandably, Mark Zuckerberg declined to participate.    Fast paced, hilarious, and parabolic, The Social Network will ensnare many into its world of competition and self-destruction. It is an excellent portrayal of Internet and youth culture in all its innovation, imagination, selfishness, and insolence. Amongst questions of class and control, we watch Mark and others chase after a sense of happiness that is ultimately hollow.
0385737947|5.0|I am 40 years old and my wife and 2 of my children read this book and said good things. I decided to see what the buzz was about and picked it up. It didn't take long for me to realize this was the kind of book that I would not be able to put down. In fact I stayed up late and read the entire book in a single day!    I have read some of the negative reviews of this book and I just don't get it. I think that there are some people who enjoy pontificating and sounding important more than providing relevant feedback about a book. Perhaps they feel smarter or more important than they really are by dissecting a book without trying to understand the reasons for some of the things they say they dislike.    I have read hundreds of novels in my life. I focus on the main purpose of a book, which is to entertain me with a good story. The Maze Runner definitely delivered a great story. I found myself wanting more and not wanting to put the book down. I think some of those nay sayer out there really didn't take the time to see the brilliance of the story.    There were some who complained about the made up slang language of the Glade. And yet youth, especially boys, are always creating their own expressions and in fact, most adults look at them in amazement when the say something that seems to make no sense or even seems dumb. Does nobody remember the common use of \\"tubular\\" in the 80s? In fact in different sub cultures and different parts of the country, different young people come up with all kinds of slang terms. Some of them like \\"cool\\" of the 50s stick forever and don't seem to last. Others like \\"groovy\\" come in and out of style and even change meanings. Then we have 80s terms that came and went and few survived.    So for me the slang of The Maze Runner worked just fine and was not only believable, but actually made it more real to me. In Lord of the Flies their own unique vocabulary and slang made it a classic and yet detractors point fingers at The Maze Runner. It makes no sense to me.    I loved the story, the mystery, the action, the questions that I kept asking just as Thomas asked them. The characters seemed very real and believable to me and those who claim there was no enough development just irritate me. The seem to forget that this story takes place in about a week. There is only so much development of characters that can take place in that period of time and make the story still feel real. Further, there are other books that focus so much on detail and character development that the story suffers. The Maze Runner balanced both nicely. The story was based on characters who had lost their memories. The development of characters was taken at an appropriate pace.    I thought the writing style was easy to read but not simple or ridden with cliches like other books. Basically I really enjoyed this book!    The purpose of fiction is to tell a story that causes the reader to enter another world and the Maze Runner did that for me. This story gripped me and didn't let go.    The story is of teenage boys who come into a place they call \\"The Glade\\" that is surrounded by a Maze...which also has dangerous creatures called \\"Grievers\\" roaming within. They have lost the memory of their lives before being brought to the Glade. They send runners out into the maze daily to try to map it out and find a way you...but the maze changes daily so they search for a pattern in the changes. They have a rigid social structure and set of laws. They have a society and have created their own slang and way of doing things and way of seeing life. They all have jobs and responsibilities and there is a hierarchy with authority figures called \\"Keepers\\". Thomas joins the \\"Gladers\\" and soon helps the \\"Gladers\\" see life differently than they had before.     The attempt to get out of the Maze without being killed or \\"stung\\" by the Grievers while still maintaining order is the prime reason for getting through each day.    Things change when a girl is send into theGlade, the first girl and the last to enter...ever.    This story kept me wanting more and I am now reading the sequel, The Scorch Trials, and I can't wait for the story to continue.    Read this book and ignore the negative reviews because every book has some and the negative reviewers are misguided and focused on the wrong things!

The plot in Percy Jackson was amazing enough, but it was totally unexpected that he would mixed in the Romans, and its turned EXTREMELY exciting.... Anyways, simply CANNOT wait for the next book..... i feel so sad that i still have to wait a whole year for the next one to come out :((( my advice to those that aren't so good at waiting: MUST buy it but don't read too early, cuz ur in for a LOOOOOONG wait.. and this book really leaves you hanging there.. now i actually regret that i read this because i don't have any patience for waiting a year....XDD
0768432626|5.0|I was impressed at so many reviews of this historic book, but I had to recognize that the book I am reporting for your review is truly the story of the Christmas Carol, but it is sprinkled with timeless godly wisdom, and this is unique.  Life issues always have an opening for our Lord to sprinkle His Wisdom into and on us for us all to learn and to grow spiritually.  Do I bleieve that Charles Dickens, when he wrote this book so many years ago, thought of a man named Scrooge who would change to love the Lord?  I don't know.  He did change his life habits. But we all know that that is not all that is needed to end up in Heaven.  Call on Jesus!  Read and listen to God's Wisdom as the story deveops and ends.

B001VNB54A|5.0|A war movie stands or falls on it ability to portray the thousand-yard stare. It's that look that a soldier will have after only a couple of days of continuous combat, that shellshocked gaze that stares into an infinity beyond the horrific reality that they have endured and must endure again, and again.    The young Marines that are sent Guadalcanal, many on their first combat mission, are pumped up for action, giddy with the fantasy of the battle to come and with that peculiar sprit de corps that only the American Marine can conjure.  As the reality of battle settles in, their faces reflect some nameless contradiction.  Disturbing beyond measure is not only the sudden, irrational death of their comrades, but the fanatical pursuit of death by their enemy. It strikes the Marine as appallingly unnatural that Japanese soldiers would fling themselves into the face of relentless machine gun defenses whose end can only be certain death.    The camera fixes on the faces of the battle weary Marine as he contemplates such otherworldly moments that seem to last forever, then on a sea of corpses that was the night's work.  The faces look familiar, not because we recognize the actors (in many cases, we aren't likely to) but because we know them from photographs of war correspondents.  Yes, I would say that HBO nails the thousand-yard stare down pretty well.    The Pacific is an ideal series for home theatre viewing.  With front projection or sizeable flat screens and a serious high-definition surround sound system we are transported, safely, into a world that few of us now living ever knew, even if our fathers did.  There is much to learn - in many instances, to learn all over again.  There is comment in the Extra Features that - rather unwittingly, I should think - warns against the tyranny of a colonial power whose manifesto is the domination of lesser peoples.    Taken at face value, the drama that is the lives of Bob Leckie, John Basilone and Gene Sledge as they played their part in that great war is powerful stuff.  As with Band of Brothers, cliche is rare (after all, war is a cliche of sorts, is it not), sentimentality is left at the door altogether.  Bombs really do burst in the air and we are their victims as are they.    As for the high definition part of the package: The Pacific looks great and will likely become a benchmark for sound reproduction.
0307594777|5.0|I buy books I want to read and re-read.  My daughter-in-law lent me the first two, another friend the third, and I knew that I wanted to read them again.  The trilogy, though intended to be merely the beginning of a longer series, happily wraps up much of what the first book started.  The two main characters are perfectly suited in literature, being almost perfect opposites.  Ms. Salander (\\"the Girl\\") is a perfect character, tatooed, brilliant, self educated, unrestrained and yet very constrained, both by life and by her own self imposed limits.  Mr. Blomquist is a methodical, equally brilliant, but conventionally educated man, very unrestrained in his love life, yet undemanding.  But some of the real appeal of these books is the almost labyrinthine plots.  Well worth reading.

0316098337|5.0|Imagine a boy born in a room, hidden from the world, with only those four walls and his mother to help him make sense of his life. Imagine his mother, kidnapped at age 19 by a terribly deranged individual, trapped - like her son - within that room. That is the situation in this marvel of a book. Broken into sections, the story is told from young Jack's point of view. He has just recently turned five. He knows nothing of the real world, even though he and his mother watch television. But, perhaps wisely, (readers will have to decide the ethics of her decision) his mother has not portrayed the outside world as real, not until she is committed to a potential means of escape.Instead, she raises her son with as much structure and fun as possible. It takes a tremendous amount of will, especially since she faces challenges such as bad teeth, pain and spells of depression.<br /><br />I was amazed by the author's ability to portray a very realistic sense of how Jack and his mother spent their days, including visits from \\"Old Nick\\", the man who holds them captive. I couldn't put the book down, even though I felt the descriptions of time spent in the room went on for a bit longer than I'd have liked. After that, though, the action and suspense builds. Looking at the world through Jack's eyes, I discovered a whole new perspective on how confusing it would be to suddenly be thrown into \\"normal\\" life after such isolation. Figures of speech were taken all too literally by him and understandably so. Just walking up a flight of stairs was frightening.<br /><br />After I finished the book, I was haunted by the idea of a boy who had to learn about the world at age 5, who'd been totally secluded until then, his spirit kept intact by a very loving mother - but without the balance of peers, other adults, an extended family, etc. This made me see the world with new eyes, thinking about how it would feel to suddenly be thrust into our society without having grown up in it.<br /><br />I couldn't help wondering if readers would have found this book wholly credible if a recent news story hadn't portrayed a very similar situation, one where a man kept a girl captive and impregnated her. In that instance, media accounts covered the woman's adjustment to the world and her ambivalence about her captor. In the book by Emma Donoghue, I think it was a stroke of genius to reveal events from Jack's viewpoint. While escaping the room may seem to be an act of salvation, it it actually a very mixed blessing, particularly for Jack's mother. There is a crisis and turning point that held me spellbound.<br /><br />Even without the events which seems to be turning points for both Jack and his mother, I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. So try to leave a whole day or two for this one. It should be among the top 10 books of the year, perhaps even the top 5. Now I want to go back and read the author's other works. Highly, highly recommended!if readers would have found this book wholly credible if a recent news story hadn't portrayed a very similar situation, one where a man kept a girl captive and impregnated her.

B000RW3VD4|3.0|This is an entertaining movie, and the acting is great.  But don't expect to learn anything on Wall Street.  Oliver Stone's father might have been a Wall Street broker, but he didn't seem to have explained the name of the game to his son.  At the end of the movie, the plot goes totally berserk, when investment banker Gekko, the character played by Michael Douglas, is sent to jail, charged for trading with insider information by the SEC !  This is absurd.  Greed has never been illegal.  And to make my point, I will put this into a historical context, illustrated by real-life examples :<br /><br />* In 1907 Morgan took advantage of a \\"panic\\" - orchestrated by New York banks - to take control of Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company, buying this firm worth $ 700 million for only $ 30 million<br /><br />* During the Great Depression, the personal wealth of Joseph P. Kennedy rised from $ 4 million in 1929 to $ 100 million in 1935.  He was not the only one.  John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Bernard Baruch, Henry Morganthau, all those Wall Street - by lack of a better word - \\"investors\\" seemed somehow to be \\"wise\\" enough to get out of the stock market just before the Crash...<br /><br />* Just after the events of 9/11, we were informed that huge volumes of American Airlines stock were traded just before the events happened.  The SEC \\"investigated\\", and later \\"classified\\" everything !  Nice work, boys !<br /><br />* In 2008, the criminal bankers of Wall Street, after making billions of dollars with junk bonds, all of a sudden were considered \\"too big to fail\\".  Instead of being sent to jail, they first got $ 700 billion \\"Main Street money\\" courtesy of Bush, followed by $ 787 billion by the hoax changer Obama, in 2009.  And at this very moment, dollars are being flooded into the economy by the Fed, obliging other central banks in the world to buy them in order not to revaluate their own currencies too much.<br /><br />Let's never forget that the Fed is a privately owned organization.  To be more precise, owned by the Rockefeller and Morgan families, following the guidelines of \\"mastermind\\" Meyer Amschel Rothschild, who is claimed to have said : \\"Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who writes the law\\".  This puts Wall Street and the Law into *real* perspective.<br /><br />When partying, the power elite of Wall Street likes to make fun with the ignorance of Main Street.  When in 1863 the National Bank Act was voted in the US, Rothschild's investment firm in London sent a memo to an associated banker in New York, which stated : \\"The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or so dependent upon its favors that there will be no opposition from that class while, on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending... will bear its burden without complaint.\\"<br /><br />That was in 1863.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|In \\"Social Network,\\" Jesse Eisenberg blossoms into an Academy-Award-worthy actor. His performance as Facebook-founder Mark Zuckerberg is, by turns, clammy, cold, vacant, snarky, and mean, as it should be. If this were a better film, I'd watch it again just to savor Eisenberg's performance.<br /><br />Zuckerberg's/Eisenberg's perfect foils, Cameron and Tyler, the Winklevoss twins, are both played by Armie Hammer, and his performance is also noteworthy. The Winklevoss twins were Harvard students and Olympic athletes from old, WASP money. Actor Armie Hammer is himself from old money. He plays the Winklevoss twins without irony - just, here I am, tall, gorgeous, blond, athletic, brilliant, rich, a superman product of WASP breeding. Given how the politically correct cultural elite of the US has demonized its WASP founders, it's amazing that the twins are not portrayed as bad guys here. They're not good guys, they're just really lucky genetic freaks / Aryan Gods. They are also shown to value old fashioned concepts like honor in business.<br /><br />That a nerdy, super-smart, manipulative, romantically unsuccessful Jewish kid, Zuckerberg, requires establishment WASP princes and ubermenschen like the Winklevosses to sponsor him, and that the Jewish kid eventually manages, through his triumphant sneakiness and cleverness and litigation, to screw the WASP princes over, is a timeworn tale treated many times before, significantly in Lion Feuchtwanger's \\"Jud Suss.\\" Given how many times storytellers have gone to this well, given the explosive and indeed deadly stereotypes at play, I wish that director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had ventured anything probing or original here, but they do not.<br /><br />\\"The Social Network\\" is every bit like the subjects it treats. The film is desperately needy, and it works too hard. The film is very loud. Characters often exchange key dialogue in clubs with loud music in the background. The dialogue features, every few seconds, a sarcastic retort.<br /><br />Every scene shouts at the viewer: SOME PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN YOU AND THEY ATTEND EXCLUSIVE PARTIES AND MAKE MONEY YOU CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF. And snort coke off hard-bellied coeds and bungee jump into built-in swimming pools and are serviced by crazed groupies in the stalls of men's rooms. Then they betray each other, and their lives are not always fully emotionally satisfying. You know, I got all that the first time the movie told me, and I really didn't need it repeated over and over and over and over again. The final scene of \\"The Social Network\\" is unbelievably cheap. If anyone tells you he was moved by that final scene, that person needs to get out more. It's a blatant, failed, attempt at a \\"rosebud\\" scene.<br /><br />I liked the film at first, but it really doesn't have anything new to say that I didn't know before I went in, and I was really eager for it to finish up. What, besides Dutch angles and noir cinematography, separates a film like \\"The Social Network\\" from a masterpiece, also about ambition, its rewards and costs, like \\"Sweet Smell of Success\\" or \\"Citizen Kane\\"? I think those who made those classics managed distance between themselves and their subjects. Orson Welles did not fall under Hearst's spell.<br /><br />Fincher and Sorkin appear to be very much in thrall to the smarts, power, and money they want to skewer, but never really do. \\"Look at this man! He's much smarter than you! He's much richer than you! And pity him because his social life is not as good as yours!\\" They shout.<br /><br />But then they don't give you any reason to care about this film except its zombie dedication to money and power. \\"The Social Network\\" says nothing about the power of facebook, or how it's changing society, or even if it is. Scenes exploring those questions would not be as cool as scenes of snorting coke off a blond teenager's belly, or watching one rich man screw over another.<br /><br />Finally, there's a miraclestory here that no one making the film is interested in pursuing, but that shines through, in spite of the film's lust for decadent wealth. Mark Zuckerberg really is smarter than you or I. That's a very wonderful thing. It's also a wonderful thing that he managed to find his way to 21st century Harvard. Had Zuckerberg been born in a mud hut in any number of locales and centuries, his abundant gift at manipulating zeros and ones would have been wasted, or even a curse. That Zuckerberg's gift was allowed to flower in capitalist America is a much bigger story than the pettiness, excess and spite the filmmakers insist on focusing on. Zuckerberg's gift, like Gates' and Jobs', etc, will live on long after he and his cofounders and fellow travelers and everyone who envied these guys or wished them dead is forgotten.pursuing, but that shines through, in spite of the film's lust for decadent wealth.

Matrix, as Leonard Maltin put it, began to break it's own rules.  If that btohered you about The Matrix, then try Inception because it is spactacular!
B00004UFTU|5.0|They did a great job remastering that CD,considering it is almost 30 years old !!! It's 200 % superior to the original product.  It is not perfect, but it's worth the investment, and it is a must for Marillion fans.  The seller does a real great job...
1423113381|5.0|In Rick Riordan's \\"The Red Pyramid\\" book, Sadie and Carter Kane, brother and sister, are the main characters.  However, in the story Sadie and Carter are separated because their mom died in a horrible accident.  Sadie stays with her grandparents in England with her cat, Muffin, and Carter stays with their dad, Dr. Julius Kane, an archeologist, traveling all around the world.    Two days every year Dr. Julius and Carter get to visit Sadie, once in the summer and once in the winter.  The beginning of this adventure happens one day when they visit Sadie, and go to the British Museum to see the Rosetta Stone. Things go horribly wrong when Julius tried to use the stone to release a god and he ends up releasing more gods than he wanted causing the stone to explode into a million pieces and a sarcophagus to come out of the ground imprisoning Julius.   During the event, Sadie and Carter fainted and the next thing you know the police are interrogating them to find out what happened.      Amos, Sadie and Carter's uncle and Julius's brother, has them live with him at his mansion while Amos tries to go look for Set, the evil god that imprisoned Julius.  When Sadie's cat, Muffin, turns out to be a god named Bast who was sent to protect them from danger they decide to go in search of Set since the demon days were getting closer.  If they get to Set before his birthday then they have a better chance of defeating him and saving the world.  However, Amos ends up captured and controlled by Set who tries to trick Sadie and Carter to go to his red pyramid where he is strongest so that he can kill them.  But since Sadie and Carter have figured out that they are godlings, Set has another thing coming.    \\"The Red Pyramid\\" was a fast read and I enjoyed it because there was a lot of action and adventure.  From the very first page I was hooked and the story always kept me guessing as to what would happen next.  Once you pick this book up and start reading, you won't be able to put it down.I also liked this book because you get to read the story from both Sadie and Carter's point of view, which changed every couple of chapters.     I can't wait for the next adventure with Sadie and Carter in the Kane Chronicles.  If you like books that have a lot of action and adventure then this first installment of the Kane Chronicles is the one for you.
B0016K40KY|5.0|Another great classic. Outstanding preformance by Peter O'Toole. I still watch this one off and on as time goes by. Winner of 7 academy awards including best picture. A must see movie.
B00116GHMM|1.0|I own a select few recent pressings and this one is by far the worst I've heard.  The lathe they cut this on must have had a bad day.  The recording speeds up and slows down, an effect know as wow.  I bought the vinyl edition hoping for a refuge from the \\"slam it to the wall\\" mastering on the CD edition.  No luck here either, tracks like Electric Feel sound just as bad as the CD release.    Note for all those working in the Music Industry; if you want us to buy stuff, give us something that's worth buying.  I'm not going to spend money on this when the downloads on the file sharing sites sound just as bad.

B003Q6D2B4|4.0|\\"Red\\" (Retired Extremely Dangerous) is an action/adventure/comedy about four former CIA operatives who have never quite lost their addiction to adrenaline.  During the opening credits, we observe a bored-looking Bruce Willis, who plays tough-as-nails Frank Moses, eating breakfast, working out, checking his mail, and chatting with a woman over the phone named Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) whom he would like to get to know better.  It is Christmas season and every house is festively decorated.  Suddenly, all heck breaks loose as a team of assassins closes in on Moses's house with enough firepower to destroy a city block.  Who is targeting Frank and why?<br /><br />Eventually, Moses teams up with his old buddies, Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich), and the still sexy Victoria (Helen Mirren), all of whom are highly-trained former operatives with an encyclopedic knowledge of firearms and explosives.  Since Frank has shown an interest in Sarah, she is dragged into the mess.  They criss-cross the country trying to elude their pursuers and find out who is behind all of the mayhem.<br /><br />This kind of satirical movie is extremely difficult to pull off.  Director Robert Schwentke tries not to wink at the audience too much, and the old pros play their parts amusingly, only occasionally going too far over the top.  The script by Jon and Erich Hoeber, based on a graphic novel, is insubstantial, and there are quite a few scenes of cartoonish violence.  Since the screenplay is not exactly Shakespearean in scope, you will need to put your brain on hold.  So, why should you see this film?  If you have a free afternoon or evening and do not mind a bit of escapism, \\"Red\\" is an enjoyable diversion.  Willis and his colleagues seem to be having a great time playing off one another and poking fun at the kind of character whom Bruce Willis portrayed so well during his salad days.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Someone connected with this project--author? director?--knows a lot of inside information. As someone with intimate knowledge of the Iraq war, I picked out a number of gems that the general public would not know. Highly recommend it.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Powerful. Off-kilter. A little strange--sounds like a future funk mixtape.     One of the best R&B CDs from 2008.     This comes together as a little comment from E Badu on the times we're living in. Both that and the music production are full of inspiration.
B003UYV08E|1.0|Oh man, where do I begin?  I wasn't even sure this was an Iron Man movie, because the suit seems to be on screen for a total of about fifteen minutes.  Downey Jr.  went way over the top with his performance.  I couldn't help but think that what he said with every twenty words could have been said with two.  He's at his best in small doses.  And Sam Rockwell? Lord, his performance reeked.  I wondered when he would ever shut his pie-hole.  He had diarrhea of the lips.  He talked a lot, but didn't say a damned thing.  This movie reminded me of the Batman movie with George Clooney and Schwarzenegger.  A seemingly great cast, occasional cool action, but crappy acting and a juvenile storyline.  It felt and sounded like all the actors got their scripts about five minutes before filming.  This movie could have been so great, but Favreau totally misfired on this one.  Total garbage that's not worth watching again.  It's already time for a reboot.
B003954I9C|5.0|I loved pretty much all the songs.  It's a definite change from the BSB, but his voice is amazing with this CD as well.
B003UYV08E|2.0|When I first settled down to watch Iron Man 2, I had some problems pretty much right off the bat. See, I couldn't quite get my head around why everyone cared so much about the Iron Man suit. Yeah, it's awesome, and I'll give you that it's way better than one un-suited person. I'm still not seeing how it's the equivalent of nuclear deterrence, though, or why North Korea and all those countries want one more than they want other, far more practical weapons, or how it could possibly insure world peace.    Then again, in the movie world it's pretty damn apparent that the Iron Man suits are all that matters. After all, as a general rule of thumb, if a character isn't wearing a suit, they're absolutely worthless. The main villain doesn't get revenge by shooting Tony Stark in the face while he gives a speech, unarmored, on a public state; no, he does the far more reliable plan of developing his own suit and slugging it out face to face.    While Whiplash is fighting Stark - and keep in mind that his suit is purely offensive; it has no armor - no security guards intervene in any way, despite the fact that a single bullet could've saved quite a few lives. Before Whiplash can finish Stark; he is hit with a car. Several times. This leads to the movie's most surprising moment: being repeatedly rammed by a few thousand tons of steel has no effect on this guy. In retrospect, however, it makes sense, because the car's not a high tech Iron Man suit.    Even once I'd managed to force myself to accept the superiority of the suits, I still found myself siding with the movie's villains more than its heroes. Not the disturbingly maniacal Whisplash, of course, but rather the US government, who, as far as I can tell, had the safety of its citizens as its primary concern. Their argument went something like: \\"no weapon sufficient to make a nation a superpower should be wielded by one wholly unsupervised international mega-vigilante,\\" and I have to say that I agree. For the first half of themovie, Stark responded by being arrogant and immature, not exactly inspiring me to change my mind.    But all right, I think we all know I was watching this the wrong way. The Dark Knight and Watchmen (the comic; I still haven't seen the movie) taught me that it's okay to look for something more than \\"that guy just got totally owned!\\" in a super hero movie, but that clearly wasn't what Iron Man 2 was trying to do.    Once I managed to beat the parts of my brain that kept tossing up all the reasons Stark should be thrown in jail and the government should take all his stuff, I managed to enjoy the movie, but even from an entertainment perspective, Iron Man 2 still fell short of the first movie. The main problem was that everything felt disjointed.    The movie's ace in the hole throughout was Robert Downey Jr., and though I thought his character was a bit of a bastard quite often, I was with him every step of the way. The first half of the movie was based on Stark's steady slide into depression, and this part was well done, with some very funny scenes. The resolution to all of Stark's problems, however, felt artificial.    The instant Stark's personal life ceased to be the focus, the movie turned to the villains. The problem with this was that the villains had, for most of the movie, been playing second fiddle. Hammer's sudden ability to compete with Stark felt like a symptom of Stark's problems, rather than a cause. As a result, having him and his psychotic developer suddenly step forward felt somewhat awkward (while still managing to be predictable), and the personal relationships never gelled with the external threat in the same way that they did in the first movie, leaving Iron Man 2 feeling like two aspects of Iron Man's life jammed together harder and harder until they fit. Sort of.    Still, Iron Man 2 wasn't a bad movie. If you enjoyed the first movie, or are just a general fan of the genre, you'll probably enjoy this - just keep in mind that it's an experience you might remember more for the popcorn than for the plot.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Great documentary that everyone who puts food into their mouths should see.  A truly honest, humane look at an inhumane and deceitful industry.  This should be required viewing in every middle school to help open young minds to harsh realities and let them make an informed decision on what they eat.  Of course, this will never happen due to the control that the mega food industry wields.  It's a wonder we can still buy this film.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|The sixth season brings the show back to great character stories. The overall plot of Lost is not nearly as important as the endearing, realistic and memorable characters. This was an excellent season for the show and while the end didn't tie up all the loose ends, it tied up enough and gave us an excellent end for the characters of the show. Also, the dvd has a bonus for those of you, myself included, who were wandering how Walt would play into things.     One of the best shows ever made. Do yourself a favor and check it out. If you like a decent drama and some mystery, you are going to be in for a treat.

B003DZX44I|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney film and one of my all time favorite films. Disney really did an excellent job with this film. With great animation, a great story with humor and heart, a timeless message, fantastic songs and score and an outstanding array of characters, this film became an instant masterpiece and no Disney film (and many others) has ever topped it. Beauty and the Beast is a film for all ages and although it's only 19 years old, it will be an eternal classic for years to come. This new Diamond Edition makes Beauty and the Beast better than ever.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast comes to Blu-Ray looking fantastic. I think no traditional-animated film has looked better. It looks brand-new with no dirt, no edge enhancement, no grain and no artifacts to be found in the print. You will be surpriused with the rich color palette that the film has and the huge amount of detail of the drawings. This Blu-Ray transfer does justice to the animators work in te film. The sound is equally impressive with a 7.1 HD sound that will rock your house. Dialogue is clear, the songs sound beautiful and the score is magnificent. This film presentation is absolutely like the movie itself. Simply astounding.<br /><br />As with the previous platinum DVD release, you have three versions of the film to choose: the theatrical 1991 version, the extended 2002 version (which is the version I prefer because Human Again is a fantastic number) and the Work in Progress version. Aside from the three presentations, you have a lot of bonus material (and I mean a lot!!).<br /><br />In disc one you have an audio-commentary, a conversation with legend compososer Alan Menken and a feature that's called Broadway Beginnings which features different stage actors that have been part of the Beauty and the Beast musical on Broadway. Rounding up Disc one is an alternate opening and a deleted scene (which are a little long but great to see).<br /><br />If you are still thirsty for more (and you should be), in Disc Two you'll find the inmmersive documentary Beyond Beauty. Just like the Hyperion Studios documentary in Snow White, this feaure covers everything that concerns the making of the film. You need a lot of your time to see everything here but is pelnty of fun and very informative. You also have some games and the Classic DVD Bonus Features ported from the Platinum DVD.<br /><br />A DVD copy is also offered. It also has the three versions of the film plus the audiocommentary and looks great for SD (better than the platinum) but it's a far cry from the quality of the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast is a fantastic film and a must-own for everyone. This Diamond Edition is a no-brainer purchase or upgrade and you should buy it. An excellent edition for an Exellent film. Completely recommended.<br /><br />Note: You should know that this Diamond Edition as the Diamond for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, comes in two presentations: one in a Blu-Ray case and the other in a DVD case. However, both editions have the same content: Two BDs and 1 DVD. If you want the 2-Disc DVD-only edition you'll have to wait until Nov. 23. The DVD-only edition won't have the same amount of bonus features as the BD.<br /><br />PD: Some ads promoting Disney new releases look very exciting including:<br /><br />Tangled (in theaters Nov. 24)<br />Toy Story 3(On DVD and Blu-Ray Nov. 2)<br />Fantasia and Fantasia 2000: 2-movie Collection Special Edition (On DVD and Blu-Ray Nov. 30)<br />A Christmas Carol (on DVD and Blu-Ray Nov. 16)<br />Bambi: Diamond Edition (on Blu-Ray combo and DVD Spring 2011)<br />The Lion KIng: Diamond Edition (on Blu-Ray combo and DVD Fall 2011)<br />Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (on Blu-Ray and DVD Feb. 2011)<br />Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary (on Blu-Ray and DVD 2011)ou should be), in Disc Two you'll find the inmmersive documentary Beyond Beauty.

142311339X|5.0|When I first heard that Rick Riordan was developing another series set in the Percy Jackson universe, I was sure it couldn't be as good as the Percy Jackson books. I am happy to say I was wrong!    With Jason, Piper, and Leo, Riordan has created another fantastic trio and wonderful adventures bringing the ancient Greek and Roman myths to life. I can't wait to read the next book!
0385342047|1.0|From my first Sophie Kinsella novel I was hooked and purchased every single book she wrote without even reading a product description. I was never dissapointed. Her books are junk food for your brain and will make you laugh out loud, which sometimes you need to do. Well, I purchased this one without even thinking. It was a no brainer.<br />Sadly, this one was one the worse books I have ever read. There were a couple of moments that were funny, but for the most part she has commpletely \\"jumped the shark\\" and I can only hope that she let's Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) RIP. She is NOT amusing anymore. A lot of people have moreal reasons for disliking these books and claim Becky is a horrible person or a bad role model, etc. etc. Who cares? I have no moral quams as long as they are entertaining.<br />Absolutely read every other book of Sophie Kinsella, and I will still continue to read when she comes out with a new stan-alone, but I think I can safely say I'm over the Shopoholic series and I hope Sophie is too!

B0041OJ0Y8|4.0|Ninja and Yolandi are two of my favorites of 2010. I was expecting more from this release thou, with the crazy Diplo produced track \\"Evil Boy\\" video. The production needed updated to really take it to the next level. The album doesn't have the full \\"Evil Boy\\", leaves off half of Ninja's rap. Where is \\"Wat Pomp\\" also, but overall the album is still quite fun. How about some remix remakes of songs to go along with this album?
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is a great way to end the series with all the action and I have enjoyed reading it. I have just started the first book in the new camp half-blood series, The Lost Hero, and I highly recommend that book when you have finished this series.
B003MZ0I84|3.0|Funny thing about artists is usually they make their best music when they are struggling. That being said Maroon 5 don't have a bad album. Their last effort was definately over produced but the songs were solid so all was forgiven. Now, onto this latest release. After listening it is very good, just not great. Their first album is by far still their best. There are some very good songs on this album and others songs I could do without. Check it out. Maybe borrow it from a friend, I did.
1934356557|4.0|I say surprisingly, because the active reader will think of numerous questions which the book never answers.  I had to keep a notepad handy to jot down \\"but what about...\\" questions.  This is actually a *good* thing.  A book that not only teaches scripted lessons but also prompts the reader to create new ones is worth reading.  As you would expect, the book assumes you know SQL, though not very much.  If you can grok the basic joins and foreign keys, you'll have no trouble.  I know exactly enough SQL to be a danger.  I might say that if you're a serious RDBMS professional, you may not get much out of this.  On the other hand, I've the victim^H^H^H^H^H^Huser of so many poorly designed \\"professional database solutions\\" that perhaps this book should be required reading.  The author is not trying to \\"wow\\" you with SQL-fu.  He deliberately keeps the SQL simple to clearly expose the (anti)patterns.  I recognized several anti-patterns which I had learned the hard way in my own work and learned a few more to avoid.
0316098337|5.0|Emma Donoghue's \\"ROOM\\" is absolutely amazing, riveting and quite unique! It was such intense reading that I just had to let things go to finish it. There was no putting it down. I just couldn't!     5 year old Jack is the narrator complete with his adorable, innocent point of view that you just can't feel too badly about the situation. He's so precious and interesting that his innocent discoveries open our eyes to an off color view of the world that makes us shake our heads. How the author conceived this idea and how she could \\"see\\" through a five year olds eyes and limited vision in order to write this is truly remarkable!    Jack and his \\"Ma\\" live in \\"Room\\". Jack tells the story of his daily activities IN THE ROOM, which he calls, \\"room\\". Chair is \\"Chair\\", etc. Obviously as the story progresses we realize that Jack has never been out of \\"room\\" and this is an abduction case but all in all this is beautifully done, building the sensation of dread, but also the heartwarming and touching relationship. Jack's father is the perpetrator. Jack's mother was kidnapped seven years before; Little Jack was born there and all of Jack's life has been in an 11 foot square room. It's all he's ever known. But one day his mother came up with an escape plan, and she and Jack finally leave \\"Room\\". Trying to live in the world outside is overwhelming. There is so much noise, so many people, and so much space. Jack and his mother have a tough time adjusting to life outside the room.    This author has done an amazing job with this subject matter. It is so emotionally charged and terrifying but at the same time Little Jack and his view point made it somehow bearable.    I recommend this unique, beautifully and expertly written novel to all those discerning readers who enjoy being amazed. This is one of those books that \\"makes a difference\\", the kind I enjoy reading and sharing.      I also love books by Picoult, Kingsbury, Pirrung, Rivers and others who write with the special \\"touch\\" to inspire. These are books the world needs more of.     Ann T. Mason
B001OQCV2E|4.0|The movie's premise: As predicted by the prophecies of an apocalyptic end in the Mayan calendar, Solar flares send neutrinos which chemically and physically alter the Earth's subterranean core, causing Earth Crust Displacement, a theory proposed by Professor Charles H. Hapgood in the 1950s.  The problem with this, however, is that it follows too closely to Lawrence E. Joseph's 2012 Apocalypse, with a hodge-podge collection of pseudo-sciences, real scientific theories, and multiple conspiracy theories.<br /><br />The movie dabbles into realism here and there; however, it's mostly special effects.  Which in this case is AWESOME!<br /><br />When limo driver Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) learns of the Earth's impending destruction - something predicted by Geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) - he morphs into a stunt car driver, Houdini in vehicular transport, a man capable of evading the Earth's cataclysmic forces, be it earthquake, tidal wave, or volcano explosions by the skin of his teeth.  He scoops up his kids, ex-wife (Amanda Peet), her boyfriend Gordon (Thomas McCarthy), and after some helpful insight from a crackpot conspiracy theorist named Charlie (Woody Harrelson) living in Yellowstone National Park, begin their escape towards a secretive last chance for species continuity.  Luckily for them, Gordon is a novice pilot with the skills of a Blue Angel, and his connections to a Russian billionaire may help the group survive.<br /><br />If the special effects are the lead role in this film, then the cast is clearly option 1A.  In addition to those already mentioned, the cast is rounded out by Dannie Glover, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, and Stephen McHattie.  They do a wonderful job despite having little to work with in the way of script.<br /><br />In the end it's a little too much Day After Tomorrow with a Deep Impact finale and there is nearly no character development, but the FX carries the film like a giant boat on an apocalyptic wave.  Sure, it's almost completely implausible, some of the science is laughable at best, and the script is very minimal, but this is just one of those popcorn movies with which a grain of salt and an empty head are necessary.t completely implausible, some of the science is laughable at best, and the script is very minimal, but this is just one of those popcorn movies with which a grain of salt and an empty head are necessary.
0525951652|5.0|There are way too many people giving this a bad review because of the Kindle price.

B003L77TZI|4.0|Okay, so let's be honest here. If you love this album your either thirteen or have average taste in music. That being said this album is very fun and hookey. Her voice is bombarded with studio effects because she can't really sing. Stop questioning me, she can't. If you think she can you fall between those categories I listed above. Would there be a Katy Perry album in the 1970's without major technology to lead the way? Absolutely not, but that's okay. This album get's 3 stars because it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. ( I since have changed my review to add a star which makes four stars, but to my amazement everything else I said above still stands true. But, this album is catchy)
0443069522|3.0|I was delighted with the book in the first few months after buying it. It was the simplest anatomy text I've ever read and I didn't even need an atlas to understand the descriptions, the pictures in Gray's fitted perfectly with the text and didn't contain lots of unwanted features - only the element being described on that page. For the first time in my life I really enjoyed the anatomy reading experience.<br /><br />However, I still had to put it aside and start reading the detailed descripition from a real anatomy textbook if I wanted to be able to talk at length about what I've learned. I actually hate details generally but Gray's is simply not enough for a medical student, it contains descriptions that ar FAR too concise for my anatomy course purposes.<br /><br />For example, the duodenum is presented in my (romanian) anatomy book in 8 pages and the authors of Gray's managed to describe it in half a page. That's both good and bad, but for me it was mostly bad.<br /><br />All in all, I guess this book wouldn't be much fun if they added more in-depth descriptions, so as it is it remains ideal for beginners (a better title would've been GRAY'S ANATOMY FOR CLUELESS STUDENTS). But since after learning every word in it I still find myself not knowing enough anatomy to pass my exams, I resent not having bought some other anatomy book.
B000JIHP88|5.0|After crashing through three weeks of motherhood like a wild boar, I realized dimly in my sleep-deprived state, that I owned this mobile.  It was placed on my registry as an afterthought, urged by overzealous parenting magazines and bolstered by good reviews.  Though it didn't fit my crib, I affixed it to the back of a dining room chair.  As I write this review, I listen to my baby sleeping peacefully after listening to a round of Mozart. I feel like shaking the baby monitor to see if it is broken. Four days ago I told my husband, \\"if this isn't a fluke, I swear, I am going to write the best product review ever.\\"  This is what I could muster without mentioning promising sex acts to the product makers.

0374158460|1.0|The edition mailed to me from Asylum Books is definitely not the American edition.  The book is smaller than standard American book sizes, the binding is very cheap, the jacket is not properly laminated, and the paper it is printed on is second class while  the margins at top and bottom are not those of the American edition. There is no price printed on the jacket flap,Where could this edition have come from?  Is it an English edition?  A pirated edition? It does say on the copyright page and the back jacket flap that it was printed in the USA.    There was a computer error in the printing of Franzen's book as reported in The NY Times, in which an uncorrected mss. was printed by mistake.  Could this be the origin of my edition of the book?  At the least, the publisher of the American edition of the book (Farrar, Straus) should be notified of this possibly illegal edition.

0143118420|1.0|This is THE most boring book I have ever read. I tried to finish it but couldn't quite make it. The story of an insane unfulfilled woman who finds no pleasure in her marriage, divorces and drops her live in New York to travel for a year to find herself in Rome, India and Indonesia. The books goes on all the way about her depression after her divorce and basically has nothing to say. I give out my copy if you are interested.
1443734543|4.0|I cannot begin to explain all of the things that I learned from this beginners book on Card Magic.  This book definitely is a must read for all of those looking to further their ability with cards.  There are many great tricks hidden in the pages too.  My only complaint is that the book isn't caught up with times and at times it takes a lot of effort to figure out what the author is trying to say.  But it is the sleights that make this book golden.  This book is chalk full of the fundamentals that every card magician needs to learn.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|As anticipated, this book was a continuation of the the previous book in the series, [[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)]]. Given that the two books read like one very long single novel, Hornet's Nest cannot be read as a standalone book.<br /><br />Larsson magnificently brings together the elements of Salander's life to tie them up in this deep character study while also especially deepening our understanding of Blomkvist, Berger, and others while also introducing other significant characters some of whom may have been highlighted in future works in the series - particularly a new love interest for Blomkvist.<br /><br />Word is that Larsson had already written the beginning and ending for book #4, nearly the entire book #5, and had outlines for books #6 and 7 in the planned 10-book series. Although it shouldn't be assumed another writer will be allowed to continue the work, it would be of historical significance to publish what was produced by this tremendous writer who was taken from us before being able to completely present the rest of his work to our culture.<br /><br />Hornet's Nest represents a tremendously satisfying ending to the trilogy, and, at least, allows us to reach a conclusion to this storyline.

B002VPE1X4|4.0|Just as the brand name suggests, this is a \\"basic\\" case for digital cameras.  That being said, the case suits its purpose and provides a usable -- if feature-light -- camera carrying case.<br /><br />The neoprene fabric of the case has both advantages and disadvantages.  On the plus side, the fabric stretches well and allows for some variability in the size of camera you can carry.  On the minus side, the neoprene does not seem as water-resistant as the heavy-duty nylon found on many competitive cases for small digital cameras.<br /><br />I recommend this case for carrying a small digital camera inside a larger, and more weather-resistant, case or bag.  I would not feel as comfortable exposing this case to the elements with an expensive camera inside.

0765326353|5.0|Seriously..I thought Sanderson really had something special with the Mistborn Trilogy.  but this...this is a work of art.  Flawless prose coupled with a completely engrossing story and compelling character development make for one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've had in several years.  I'm dying for the next one.  Hear that Sanderson??  DYING!!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I am not a fan of DiCaprio and i am normally not into this sort of movie. But this was excellent! I am just astonished that anyone could give this movie a bad rating. For once i was actually surprised by some things in this film but i can't say more or it may ruin it. If you want a flick to get engrossed in, grab some popcorn and settle in , this is the film you have been waiting for.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie is the perfection of everything you could want in a film. Action, Drama, and Special effects done in such a unique way. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat. The people who wrote negative reviews on this movie are the same people who thought that Sandra Bullock deserved the Oscar for the most overrated movie of all time the Blindside.

0385738757|3.0|As a fan of THE MAZE RUNNER, I pre-ordered THE SCORCH TRIALS and waited anxiously for its arrival.  You can imagine my disappointment, then, when I found it less than a-Maze-ing.  Really.  It comes off like it was written in a rush: scenes are set up, but not delivered; characters say things, which are forgotten; and events become so jumbled and tedious that the reader risks not caring anymore.<br /><br />Examples: At one point the remaining Gladers come across an old man who warns them that an approaching lightning storm will bring out some very bad people.  Reasonably, the reader waits for some creatures to spring out of the woodwork (or air, or raindrops, or whatever) with the storm, but instead the weather just delivers some killer lightning bolts, then subsides.  No bad people.  It reminded me of Chekhov's advice to beginning writers: Don't mention the gun above the fireplace unless it's going to be fired by the end of the story.  Then the Gladers pick up two Cranks (people infected with the Flare who are in varying degrees of decline, the worst of which look like Zombies) named Jorge and Brenda.  They join the boys in their quest, but seem to be forgotten by the author for great stretches.  In his initial scene, Jorge appears to be a new major player (and spouts some Spanish because apparently we are in what was once Mexico -- mentioned only once as well).  Only toward the end is Jorge even brought up again, and he speaks hardly at all.  Why bother writing him in, one wonders?  As for Brenda, she gets top billing with Thomas in an escape sequence mid-novel, only to become the equivalent of wallpaper by the end.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book does not deliver on the logical front or the fright front.  It's so confusing that even Dashner appears confused.  Teresa is on Thomas's side, then not, then is, then isn't, then isn't sure if she is (or maybe that's Thomas who isn't sure).  And there are repeated scenes where someone (or something) jumps out and says, \\"I'm going to kill you\\" (and could easily), then doesn't. Also, a seemingly important confrontation is built up between Group B (a mirror image of all girls and one boy from another Glade) and the boys from THE MAZE RUNNER.  We are told Group B is to kill the Gladers, in fact.  But if you expect an epic confrontation between the two groups (a riff on THE HUNGER GAMES, say), you'll be let down in a big way.  It's as if Dashner had these great ideas, introduced them, and them became preoccupied with other matters.<br /><br />What, then, to make of this book?  Apparently this is all the planning of WICKED and part of their blueprints and variables, but, overall, I'd say the variables in plot have made this book dizzy and that Dashner himself needed a better blueprint before starting.  The charm of the first book, so reminiscent of LORD OF THE FLIES yet unique its own way, is AWOL here.  It's too bad, too.  I was pulling for this book all the way.  Now?  Now I'll probably take a pass on Book Three.  Will some hardcore MAZE RUNNER fans disagree with me?  Sure.  But I'm convinced that I'm not the only fan who will fall here, sadly enough, just as some Gladers do while traveling the Scorch.you\\" (and could easily), then doesn't.

B002HRTMHQ|4.0|The early sixties through to the mid seventies represents the heyday of soul music. Between them Motown, Atlantic and Stax-Volt released an endless stream of memorable singles. As I grew from a young teenager into an adult I listened endlessly to Smokey, Marvin, Otis, Curtis, the Temps, Delfonics, Stylistics and myriad others. Mayer Hawthorne, although several generations younger than me, obviously shares my love for this music. Like Lewis Taylor (on his incredible The Lost Album) Mr. Hawthorne wears his influences on his sleeve without becoming merely a copycat. I love the fact that he keeps the songs at around three minutes and that he didn't feel that he had to fill every last second of the available capacity that a cd affords. Each song on the cd is a catchy, finger-snapping, toe-tapping confection. After listening to A Strange Arrangement a couple of times before sitting down to write my review I listened to a couple of dozen Miracles' songs. What became immediately apparent is that Hawthorne does have some vocal limitations - as a soloist (i.e. without the double tracking) he can sound a little thin. However, I am quibbling. This is a great debut. I'd love for a top notch producer to get in the studio with this guy.

1591843162|4.0|The author reminds the reader that the linchpin, the difference-maker and most valued member of an organization, not only has the insight but the emotional labor to move his/her insight into action.  Although this is not revolutionary thinking, the author does an effective job of framing this idea into his own context.  Be an artist!  In a way, part of the book is a wake-up call for the worker in the modern American economy.  The economics lesson is that the age of the cog employee has faded away and prosperity is left for those who can prove their value as a linchpin.

0811876373|4.0|I decided to buy this book after seeing Bakerella's Jack O' Lanturn cake pops on a Betty Crocker recipe book. I had no idea how obsessed I would quickly become, torturing my unsuspecting family members and co-workers with these sinful treats. The book, Cake Pops, was an excellent way to start this new insanity of mine. There are wonderful photos and helpful hints at preparing these little gourmet goodies. However, there are many more tips on the internet via You Tube that would also be very helpful. The one thing that I do differently than Bakerella is I crumble my cake in my Kitchenaid mixer versus by hand which will greatly decrease your production time. You still get the same fantastic results that Bakerella gets. Either way this book is a great way to start and you can't help but love the pictures of her imaginitive creations!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|What can i say to add to the praise of this movie? I think anyone who gave this less than high points must have been watching something else. This movie is anything but disappointing. If you are only into people being shot and car chase scenes and drug deals then this is not for you. But if you like to be kept guessing and dont mind getting inside the mind of the character and enjoy psychological suspense and good crime films then you have got to see this one. Do yourself a favor and watch it !
1439181780|2.0|I was really hoping for something like the secret... HOwever, I felt like the author just replaced \\"the power\\" for \\"the secret\\"...  yes she changed some words around... paraphrased... but really there wasn't that much difference in this book than The Secret...  It was sure a way for her to make alot more money though... too late now to see that there wasn't a great difference...
B00456PKG4|5.0|I think people are too hard on this film.  It is by far not an incredible film if compared to a film that is in contention for an Oscar, but overall the film was very good.  The plot made sense and was understandable, if anything I would say the ending felt a bit rushed compared to the rest of the film.  If you're looking for a good action film which is light and fun this is it, a departure from recent action films and more circa the 90s but fun and entertaining film none the less.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I watched \\"Life\\" on TV, but could not get through the first episode because Oprah's dry narration made me sleepy very quickly. I like nature movies, and I like her Ok, no definite opinion about her one way or another. It was clear that she lacks experience about the subject, and she lacked skills for narration. I was excited before the show started and was planning to buy \\"Life\\" on DVD, but too bad, Oprah killed \\"Life\\". I am pretty sure that she regrets having taken on the project.<br /><br />Dave Attenborough on the other hand is probably The Expert in the world about the subject. I own most of his nature DVDs. His knowledge, skills, and passion are infectious. I am glad that I now can buy his version, the original \\"Life\\".
B003ELOQCA|4.0|It was a good show but could have been better.<br />The set was just ok needs more hits, less new stuff.<br />The band sound's great the hole show and bono's vocal's are great.<br />Cool video but not the best from U2.
B00456PKG4|4.0|I liked it. I could see all the hard work Jake put into this movie. It really impresses me that he did those stunts.  The only thing that was bad was the spotty story. There were times where story didn't seem to go with the flow. I still liked it and that's all that matters.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|Well being that i usually have other means of getting movies, cough, i still have been waiting for this to come out in high def for a long time. But to be honest with you i think most people are right when they says just release them separately or lower the price. Also i can say that yes a lot of the movies don't get the attention they deserve when it comes to blu ray transfer. The Alien movies are great, that is the first two. Alien is classic and should be a masterpiece to view on blu-ray, Aliens is even more of a masterpiece and deserves the best quality that Blu-ray has to offer. Will it get it? Hopefully, but not likely. A lot of things depend on your blu-ray player, your HDTV, and a few other small deciding factors. I for one use my PS3 which is still one of the best players on the market, also i will say that there are a few other brands out there that are great as well. That being said i will not shell out 100$(that i can pay my electric bill with, plus gas), for movies i've owned for the last 10 years on dvd, and another 15 on VHS before that. Do the normal thing, wait, get Aliens for about 24 bucks or so, Alien for the same, and Alien 3(which is ok, not spectacular) for around 20. We all god ripped on lord of the rings, which was not the extended versions and people were furious, well they have a right to be. They hype all the blu-ray technology, then they half-a$$ the release by jipping the consumers out of nearly 3 hours of additional footage! Blu-ray discs have a capability of anywhere from 50 to 100gigs, so you could fit nearly all the movies on one disc alone, why has no one taken advantage of this, who knows? At any rate these movies are much like Rambo, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Jurassic Park, people really want them and don't want to shell out half of there rent to do so. The box set garbage has got to go, its like shopping at SAMS club where you just can't buy one candy bar if your hungry, you have to buy a pack of 30. Speaking of Rambo, i gotthose for very cheap, only 10 bucks a piece, now thats correct for a movie of that age, and that's what makes people actually buy these products. The Rambos, actually and the Rockys have good and great movies, so go figure. First Blood looked amazing, the rest not so much. Also with Rocky only the first and the V(come on) looked of good blu ray quality. The 3rd being my favorite, I wanted Mr T pity the fool straight up super HI DEF, which i didn't get, it was extremely grainy and the HDTV version through Comcast looked much better. Lets hope its different with these, lets \\"hope\\". So give us the option FOX. When it comes to the movies here's my take.    1.Aliens-The first i was exposed to, tense, funny, in your face good paced action, makes Avatar look like Marry Poppins. The first i saw at 12 or so.(Director James Cameron, Avatar, T-2, and Titanic)  2.Alien-While very slow, its still very scary because if you've never seen Aliens you don't know what your about the witness,(Newcomers start with this one). Also Ridley Scott made this one,(Director of Gladiator, American Gangster and Robin Hood(2010).  3.Alien 3-Superb acting yet lacking in suspense. You know what the Alien looks like by now, but a bunch of British inmates in a prison on another planet find out the hard way. Not bad, but it seems more like a good Crime who done it thriller, more so than Sci Fi Horror.(Director David Fincher-Seven, Fight Club and Zodiac).  4.Alien Resurrection-The worst, i can't even get through this movie, the only thing worth watching in it is the hot as hell Wynonna Ryder, wow she was cute. Other than that its cheesy, completely over the top gross, and just reminds you of a wanna be Alien movie that someone tried to make. I could have cared less if they even put this on Blu-Ray.(Director-I don't care).    So other than me complaining about the 100$ price tag, that's how i rate the movies in short. Hey at least i did:D So buy and do as you will, i'll just wait for the sold separatelyones. Also hurry up Speilburg and Lucas, give us the ones i mentioned above, and don't charge us 1000$!! The Back To The Future pack is less then 50 bucks in most places, i think mainly because after the first one they were very very sup par films. Later.

B0019NB9A2|5.0|In comparing the 50th Anniversary Edition to this Hi Def release, I would say the Video quality is marginally better, a little more detail is there. The special features are the same here, no more or less.  It's the uncompressed Audio that makes the Blu-Ray Disc a must-have for fans. Sound clarity is present, one can distinctly hear the breathing of the id monster as it approaches and ascends the stairs of the starship, even while the guards are speaking.
0896898288|3.0|Buy this book to read.  Buy this book to enjoy the photographs, but DON'T buy this book intending to make any of the 111 quilt blocks!  First of all, the CD will break almost immediately or soon thereafter.  That said, they are very good about replacing it with one that works.  However, as you may have noticed, most of the reviewers say: \\"I can't wait to start making the blocks!\\"  None of them talk about completing the blocks!  There is a reason why this is so: without drafting help, they are very very difficult to size and put together.  The templates would have you working with bias edges etc. when a simple cutting diagram could avoid this problem.  Many quilt shops have drafted the blocks with better cutting instructions and are offering classes using this book. Try to find such a workshop or class before you start making them. It isn't IMPOSSIBLE to make them, but it is very frustrating, disappointing, and challenging, even for a quilter who is very experienced.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|This cd imo the best one they ever put out , it's so melodic and they are bridging folk rock and psych here in a way that sound just incredible. Of course they build on this as they move on into the next decades but here is where they cut loose. I love most of their cds and have everything right up onto the last starship cd. But this one defined a generation probably and lcd hadn't effected them as much as it would later musically as well as mentally.<br />This one was more about just making great music and they succeeded with every song on here , from the hit's like 'white rabbit' to the pretty songs like 'comin back to me'  get this one , even if you are not a completist like me you'll love the tunes on here.
B0039TD7RC|1.0|(REVISED 11/12) As a die-hard Stones,  I am horrified by what I read, and even some of the samples I am listening to now. There is nothing worse than a CD that sounds harsh and overdriven, and remixed.  This is unnecessary. I have heard plenty of awesome and authentic sounding CDs, like the Zep catalogue that was remastered years ago, and nothing remains to be improved upon. They sound great. They are there when you want them. But when my heroes, the Stones, alter the mix of a classic, I have to draw the line. This is messing with history. It is never 'improving upon it.' It's like cheating. I have not seen the jacket, but am I to understand that Wyman and Taylor have been air-brushed out? Did I hear this right? This is unforgivable. The Stones always made great album covers and to alter them is a little short of sick - maybe. They have finally gone too far. Maybe they are too old, rich and greedy now, I hope not. I am glad I own all the 'old' virgin issues and do not have to put up with this for now. Whatever Mick thought of Allen Klein's business practices, Allen has at least treated their music with more respect. The 60s stuff sounds great, and well, I guess their 70s and 80s own-label stuff is, well, now awful. I just hope these guys are going to fix this, although it may be years before they can do this, so take good care of those virgin issues, guys. And what about these bonus track? I mean c'mon we all know that excellent outtakes exist from this album and any respectable collector already has them. What a nightmare this is. And then there is that other review here where the guy calls the CD 'imperfect' and suggests getting a new format, something called Lossless 2.9 or some crap, he's a big help here, right....REVISED: well, I have now hear this. And yes, it is gunned up too far. It's not really that bad or anything, but yes they just made it louder taking the high-mid, mid, and low-mid with it. It's not rocket science. I transfered a copy to cassettte bringing down the levels and it's now comparable to the virgin issue. There is still no excuse for this....it's just sloppy mastering...Some Girls I heard thru ear dubs and that is enough, it's really butched, they gunned up the high-mid way too far along with the whole frequency range....
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I love Avril's music. She is extremely talented and has a style of her own, even though she is sometimes compared to other \\"angst-driven\\" artists. I definitely enjoy her earlier music more than her newer works and this album is incredible.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was very surprise with this book. I did not read any of the reviews or anything else before I picked up this book, and once I started reading it and I could not stop. This author is a genius, I am very sorry that we won't have more books from this author. You have to read it.
0810988232|2.0|I am a massive fan of Brian Froud's work and the original Faerie Oracle deck is my fav deck to use for readings for many years.     I was so disappointed when I finally got to touch these cards. The cards themselves are very flimsy in quality. The worst quality I have seen so far for any oracle/tarot deck. The art work, although beautiful, just isn't as carefully planned and selected as the original oracle. As such I just get a bad vibe picking these up, looking through them etc. They just don't seem balanced/harmonized.     Since I have a lot of Brian Froud's books I have seen a lot of the art work before. The images seemed to be have been treated like 'pick n mix' and there are even characters from movie concepts and another divination book the Faery Runes. So I felt a bit cheated. It just didn't feel right seeing that art work, especially concept art, forced together in something used as a divination tool. It just feels really messy as a whole.     The book itself I admit I have only flipped through. But what I did read just seemed very wishy-washy and not really thought through and left no real imprint on me at all.     This is the first thing by the Froud's that I have actually felt like taking back to the store for a refund as I was so disappointed.   If you want a deck with art work from Froud buy the first one  ''[[ASIN:0743201116 The Faeries' Oracle]]'' its better quality, it has better design and the cards actually go well together. Otherwise just buy his other art books.
030726999X|4.0|When you read a mystery thriller such as this, especially the final part of the series it must captivate your attention from beginning to end. For me it was a phenomenal read and I consider myself a bookworm to say the least. At the time of this review I became a new mother and so often I am up in the middle of the night nursing my son, struggling to stay awake. I can honestly say this book from the very beginning to the very end literally kept me up all-night...I could not put the book down !!! I absolutely had to know exactly how Lisbeth Salander was planning her revenge against Swedish society. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars out of 5 is (I'll keep this part vague in the interest of not ruining the surprise for those whom haven't read it yet) is I would have liked to seen more of a final-judgement follow-up of her adversaries. Otherwise a fantastic, must-read book! Stieg Larsson was an excellent writer and a talented individual and it is regrettable that he left this earth so soon. His legend lives on in the Salander/Blomkvist adventure.Buy the book!
B0015DROBO|4.0|Author's style is great. Not too much non-essential material scattered in to stretch out the length of the book.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great sequel.  Solid, entertaining, very difficult to put down.  You could read this book without reading the first book because the author always gives a summary of the events, but of course is better if you read the first one.

0345505387|3.0|\\"The Exile\\" is basically \\"Outlander\\" from a different perspective. Instead of following Claire from the beginning, the reader follows Jamie Fraser from France back to his homeland. Claire, accidentally sent back from World War II era gets caught up in the constant struggle between the Scots and the Brits, as well as the tension between clans. Claire and Jamie meet, and the only way to keep her safe from immediate capture is to marry her to Jamie. But that doesn't stop trouble from finding the couple, heartwrenching trouble, over and over again.<br /><br />Let's start with the artwork - at first, I wasn't sure if Claire or Jamie really looked like what I pictured. I mean, of course no one or thing could come close to the image of the characters I had in my head while reading \\"Outlander,\\" but the more I read \\"The Exile,\\" the better the artwork seemed. I had some issues with Claire's busom, but otherwise, I thought the artist did well in depicting these rather infamous characters. The art really is beautiful, and the action scenes were very well done. Sometimes that can be tough, since you're really just getting stills of a complicated fight scene - but everything seemed clear and the reader was given some excellent shots.<br /><br />It was nice to get more characters' thoughts - In \\"Outlander\\" we only get so much thought process, and only for certain people. Other characters have to get their ideas out there by way of the plot, so it was nice to have the thought bubbles giving the reader a hint of what the other characters want. However, I was a little upset that one of the scenes \\"Outlander\\" is infamous for is not in the book at all - Jamie has his share of bad history that he shares, but the scene that made the end of \\"Outlander\\" so heartbreaking was left out entirely. I can see how, space-wise, some things had to be left out, otherwise \\"The Exile\\" would be way too long. But a scene that powerful, that IMPORTANT, part of what makes \\"Outlander\\" famous? I would have liked to see it.<br /><br />Finally, the graphic novel really lacks the punch and heart of \\"Outlander.\\" \\"The Exile\\" was a good read, but no where close to the book. I felt so connected to the characters in \\"Outlander,\\" I cared about them, I worried for them, I nearly cried during the last half of the book. But I got none of the emotional tug on the heartstrings during \\"The Exile.\\" I used to read graphic novels and mangas by the truck loads, so I know these books can make the reader feel, worry, etc. But I just did not get that from this book.<br /><br />I'm going to give \\"The Exile\\" by Diana Gabaldon and Hoang Nguyen a THREE out of FIVE (3/5). It didn't have the connection with the characters that you get in \\"Outlander.\\" I would recommend \\"The Exile\\" to die-hard fans of the \\"Outlander\\" series, either to just complete their collection, or to see the story from a slightly different perspective..

I'm sure that George Harrison -- who is certainly in heaven -- must feel honored by it.
142311339X|5.0|The anticipation surrounding Rick Riordan's latest novel The Lost Hero  was so strong, we could have built a temple atop it! What's not to love? A whole new batch of demigod heroes sent to rescue the world again. Riordan's novel gratefully returns us from his brief Egyptian venture (personally, that was a poor choice of a new series, but I'll cover that later) and returns us to the god fearing, monster battling world of camp Half-Blood. This time, we follow a whole new set of demigods as they race to uncover who, or more precisely, what, has stolen a member of the Olympic counsel.<br /><br />Camp Half-Blood is in turmoil. Percy Jackson is missing. The gods are silent. The Doors of Death are open. Something is rising in the west (again). A supposed rescue mission for Percy instead rescues three new demigods, who will change the camp and the future of the Olympic gods forever.<br /><br />Meet Jason, Piper, and Leo, three demigods unaware of who they really are. As usual, Riordan throws in some teenage puppy love, a few middle school jokes, and an evil bully who turns into a monster. Yet, Riordan still manages to make it seem all new, and not like a Percy Jackson Jr. Book. After a close fight with a bully turned tornado, our heroes are rescued by none other than Annabeth Chase, hero from the last Percy Jackson series. I really liked how Riordan wove these two series together. this book focused on new demigods and only included brief appearances by Annabeth, Chiron, and Rachel Dare (Oracle Extraordinaire). Don't get me wrong, I loved those characters, but as this is a \\"new series\\" I'd love to meet the new characters. Don't worry, from the next book's title, Son of Neptune, it is obvious that Percy Jackson still has a major role to play.<br /><br />Anyways, with Olympus silent and Hera missing, it is up to our brave heroes to figure out where, and how, to rescue her. Transportation by mechanical Dragon, is no problem for Leo, son of Hephaestus, while cajoling people into lending them resources is similarly not a problem for Piper, daughter of Athena. By switching around the major god's influences on the main characters, Riordan has allowed the reader to discover new concepts about these gods/goddesses. Personally, my viewpoint on Aphrodite in the previous books was...well...that she was a complete and total ditz (Understandable, based on the actions of her children in the Jackson Series). And yet within T.L.H, one cannot help but find her influence on Piper in the best possible way, showing how love can be the strongest of weapons in defense of your friends. Hephaestus too comes across as a socially awkward, but caring father-from-afar. I won't tell you who Jason's father is, but he does end up meeting his sister out on the trail of the missing goddess.<br /><br />As usual, Riordan peppers in impressive fight scenes, a host of new villains/monsters, more modern technology mixed with ancient Greek cultural traditions and figures (the Aeolus Weather Channel, with gods changing the forecast every minute or so, provides another cool moment of insight into the evolution of Greek gods and spirits) The book gradually takes on a more Roman flavor the further on you read. each chapter introducing new roman concepts, and gradually all pointing to the fact that Jason is...well...not quite Greek in terms of thinking.<br /><br />This book is a definite must read, and had me up till the wee hours reading diligently and excitedly for each new page. For fans of Riordan, this book will leave you much more excited than the Red Pyramid did, and will also make you wish that his next book comes out sooner than late 2011.

0307454541|1.0|I have never reviewed a book on Amazon before, but I had to review this one because it was such a rediculous disappointment.  I stopped and started, stopped and started, so many times.  I couldn't understand all the hype and figured I'd have to push through the pages and pages of mind-numbing details to get to the \\"good\\" part.  Folks...there is 300 pages of exposition.  I'm not kidding.  I figured this must all be necessary in order to really build up to the big mystery.  What is supposed to be the all consuming mystery of this book is resolved in about two paragraphs.  I was ready to chuck the book out the window at this point.  The rest is nothing put financial talk about saving the main character's magazine.  I don't care about a magazine!  Why would I want to read a book about a magazine???  Serioulsy, I really don't get it.  Read something else.  ANYTHING else.  The user's manual for my kindle was more engaging.
B003YWUTKM|5.0|These 4 slabs of heaven have a little bit of all thats good in music. There's so many subtley introduced rhythms and styles, carefully crafted into these 20 minute plus journeys.    Some times you here classic KLF/Orb ambient bliss, then a slow bass drum kicks in and you start to groove, and before you know it added rhythms are thrown in between that bass and you can be dancing like a loon, like at the old Club Dog/ Whirlygig days of early 90's progressive acid house.    Thrown into this are the soaring licks of the incomparable Mr Gilmour.    The idiotic reviews I've read in the press are ridiculous, clearly written by idiotic kids who flipped through it on there car stereo and havn't really listened to it.    Marvellous stuff

B002ZCY7PU|3.0|The fun thin g with the previous seasons of Chick was that the hero was a nerd caught up in a world of espionage that he did not control. Here however he has become a real spy and that does ruin the fun for the first part of the season which is simply much less fun. Indeed, the whole thing is no longer that fun or even credible as Chuck becomes a savvy spy. However the whole thing does improve at about mid-season and then becomes quite n ice to watch again.
B00004XQP4|4.0|From the first strokes of acoustic guitar that open \\"Warning\\" to the deeply introspective closer, \\"Macy's Day Parade,\\" Green Day were sending out a message. They weren't gonna be dookie-heads any more. Everything from the somber cover to the mandolins and accordions that made their appearances on the CD were blatant signs that \\"Warning\\" was more than just the title on the record. Green Day was going to try to break free from the old molds.<br /><br />While this was a very good, if tentative move that \\"American Idiot\\" would codify a few years later, \\"Warning\\" has lots going for it. The title track has a lyrical quirkiness that made it (at least to me) the equal of Alice Cooper's \\"Generation Landslide.\\" \\"Misery\\" takes a darker look at the castaways that come to San Fransisco only to find that the dreams of the city are often just fiction, while \\"Waiting\\" is the same dream trying to come to life. As Billie Joe sings in \\"Macy's Day Parade,\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm thinking about a brand new hope,<br />One I've never known<br />'cause now I know<br />it's all I ever wanted.\\"<br /><br />It's a far cry from the Buzzcocks/Ramones worshiping trio that once complained that \\"m*sterb*tion's lost its thrill.\\" Because of that, \\"Warning\\" remains one of my favorite Green Day albums.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Guitar gods of three periods in rock come together and hold a retrospective summit, discussing influences, techniques, songwriting, recording, you name it.  Oh, and it turns out, instruments are going to be laying around as well.  Wonder what that will lead to?    This film is a good deal better than an ordinary musical retrospective.  Page, Edge and White are all intelligent musicians, each with their own style and techniques, but each just oozing love of music.  The viewer just finds himself with a stupid grin on his face loving almost every minute of the movie.  There are moments of reflection, of discovery, of plain enthusiasm and joy.  The reviewer has spent plenty of time jumping up and down on the edge of his bed as a youth, jamming to Zeppelin tunes with a tennis racket for an air guitar; unbelieveable to watch Jimmy Page playing air guitar listening to his own heroes!    The film is well made, nicely paced, beautifully filmed and set, and a great look at three incredible and incredibly influential musicians.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|This already wonderful series really improves here. After two seasons recounting the encounter of nerd researchers Leonard and Sheldon with Penny, we now have what is clearly the best comedy around at this time and probably one of the best ever. The series starts with Penny and Leonard having engaged in a relationship and it is able to deal with this premise in a great way, and manages to stay incredibly funny. In addition to the main cast there is a series of impressive guest stars on the show such as Stan Lee and Will Wheaton as themselves; even these stars do not detract from the main storylines. The series manages to deal with a number of difefrent events so that is is never boring.

1439133948|5.0|I first read Ms. Bujold's Vorkosigan series when I was in high school in the 1990's. I have reread those books and was eagerly awaiting this next saga. I was not disappointed. This is a book about death, how we deal with it and growing old.<br /><br />Once again we are again pulled along Miles' wake as he first tries to figure out what is so fishy about the cryonics deal Kommar has with New Hope II otherwise known as Kibou-daini. Kibou is a planet obsessed with death and with trying to beat it and old age. Miles, in the course of resolving his assignment from Gregor and helping 11 year old Jin (two birds one stone kind of thing) must think of his own views on death and aging. In the end these things are easily skimmed over the first time you read this novel. Easily skimmed that is, until the end when Bujold hit you with a train you didn't even see coming. Now those issues Miles and the reader skimmed over are even more profound and I felt a compulsive need to reread the book.<br /><br />I know this sound like a cryptic review, but you can read a plot summary above before you purchase and any spoilers will truly spoil the book. I can tell you we see a different side Miles who can seem cold even unattached in this book due to the perspective of new characters, who truly have no clue who Miles is. Readers are reassured that the Miles we have come to know is still the same (older & wiser) when the story switches to his perspective. We also see how Miles has grown into his job as Imperial Auditor and Bujold's prose is as witty as ever.  I can only give you my best recommendation for a story; it was engrossing, it made me laugh, think and cry. All the things a great story is supposed to do.
1400052173|5.0|A  Review  of the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot    A Review by Sonja Terry (pseudonym)  In this non- fictional work, what author, Rebecca Skloot has done for Henrietta Lacks, is similar to the literary rehabilitation done by Alice Walker for Zora Neale Hurston, except that the first was done for her major contributions to science and the latter for hers to literature and anthropology. Both African American women, Henrietta and Zora would tragically end up in unmarked graves despite their extraordinary dedication to their communities and posthumous fame. It is to their credit that neither of these authors, one white and one black, was looking for fame or self- gain but more so for the triumph of social justice. Diagnosed with cervical cancer, Henrietta Lacks, a black woman tobacco sharecropper, who just wanted to make a living for herself and her children in the most unassuming way, was stripped of some of her cells, without her knowledge, for the purpose of research. This medical intrusion into her body continued after her death during a dehumanizing autopsy. Yet the outcome of the procedure was sanitized and declared a new scientific miracle: her cells were the first live cells successfully cultivated in the world, later known as He La. These allowed scientists, decades later, to find cures for hundreds of diseases deemed incurable at the time. But the tragic irony was that \\"He La's\\" children were so poor that they themselves had no means for proper health care nor education; to add insult to injury, they were kept in the dark for over two decades about the fate of their mother's cells. When they found out, the shock almost killed some and drove others insane. Rebecca Skloot is a Science journalist who sets the record straight about the human exploitation and dehumanization of Lacks and her descendants as she denounces the total absence of a bio-ethical conscience at the time, but she also points to many continued medical abuses and injusticesin the present. This book will change the way you look at science and the media, perhaps, just perhaps a few young people will find a reason to pursue a college education. Without a superior education  humans increase their vulnerability to a wide array of societal schemes. Start asking questions and take ownership of every parcel of your life.

B00005QGAT|4.0|Off The Wall is very different from the next albums Jackson would release, it has more of that 1970's disco/funk/pop song sound to it (that sound about right), it sound very different from the 80's pop sound Michael became famous for. Here Michael was just a largely enthusiastic 21 year old ready to set the world on fire, and he did. People tend to forget that Off The Wall was considered a success; it went on to sell over quite a few million copies. Thriller's is Jackson' s best known work and rightfully so but Off The Wall is a very enjoyable and different album, to some MJ's first mature solo effort (his earlier solo records were released when he was much younger) is his best one (in fact producer Quincy Jones is very clear that OTW is his favorite work completed with Michael). This was Michael's first big break from the Jackson 5/Jacksons, he really set himself apart with Off The Wall, and Michael was in a league beyond his brother's in terms of music. Jackson put out some great music with his brothers and was always the main focus of the Jackson 5; it was only a matter of time before he became a star on his own.<br /><br />I really do like the songs on OTW. The title track is insanely catchy and I love the disco sound, the song just grabs you and never lets you go. Rock With You is a slower paced song and to me is probably the most memorable one due to it's fantastic video. Don't Stop `Till You Get Enough shows incredible energy and I feel it's one the highlights of MJ's career. The funky, high-bass Get On The Floor is an excellent groovy song. The Paul McCartney written Girlfriend is obviously the weakest song here, I was never a big fan of this one, it may sound sad but to me it's very much filler material and is the weakest song here. She's Out Of My Life is a beautiful ballad that has MJ crying, in fact you can hear it at the very end of the songs, talk about a passionate and emotional performance.<br /><br />The special edition of Off The Wall offers an interview with producer Quincy Jones and two demos. At least there is a little extra for the fans, always nice to have even if it's just a little. I feel that Off The Wall is an excellent album with a fun and memorable sound but to me it's not MJ's best recording, it's a very different one thought and it's of course an enjoyable one and one that fans should without a doubt own! 4/5.ucer Quincy Jones and two demos.

B00005QGAX|5.0|No really, how do you continue from Thriller? Where do you go? I'd say Bad is probably the best way to do it. Released 8 years after MJ's debut, Off The Wall, and 5 years after his massive worldwide success, Thriller, 1987's Bad showed that Michael Jackson could survive in the music industry and continue to grow musically and break records. Bad is very different from its predecessor, it's not a total departure from the sound of Thriller but it has a very different sound as well. MJ did not fossilize after Thriller, Bad certainly proves this point. Bad contains many memorable songs from the King of Pop and it's safe to say you probably heard a few of these songs before. Thriller deserves recognition, so does Bad.<br /><br />I'll be honest, as much as I love Thriller and enjoyed it, Bad might just be my personal favorite Michael Jackson album. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of just about anything the man has done, and I've got to say that Thriller has undeniably Michael's greatest hits and his best-known songs but Bad should not be overlooked. A lot of my favorite Michael Jackson songs are here. There is of course the excellent and catchy title track with a quite memorable video that showed Michael's new \\"Bad\\" look. Smooth Criminal is one of the highlights of MJ's career; the song is instantly recognizable and to me remains Jackson's best music video! I like the melodic Dirty Diana, MJ sounds so passionate here and I love the rock' n roll guitars thrown in. It's an amazing ballad that impressed me the first time I heard it, I think this song should get more recognition as it certainly deserves so. I like how personal Leave Me Alone is; the lyrics are terrific and show a lot of emotion. The Way You Make Me Feel is a great upbeat pop song, it's another excellent song. Man In The Mirror is one of MJ's most beautiful songs in terms of well...just about anything! Lyrics, music, singing are really powerful. The same could be said for I Just Can't Stop Loving You.<br /><br />Today after hearing so much about Michael Jackson's achievements in the music industry with all the record sales, the awards and current state of record sales it's a little funny to think that Bad was initially considered a failure because it didn't match Thriller! Thriller, as you know is the best-selling album of all time it sold over 50 million albums (thought I'm not sure about the exact number, it's hard to say exactly), Bad sold 30 million copies which is quite an impressive feat, however, it did not match the sales of Thriller (and Dangerous while we're at it, which sold 33 million copies if I am correct). This special edition of Bad is a neat one because it gives bonuses like interviews and extra material. It's always nice to get extras, especially when you're a fan. As much as I enjoyed MJ's enthusiastic debut Off The Wall when everything seemed possible, the titan that is Thriller, Dangerous and his latter work, Bad is a special  one for me, but then again it can be tricky to pick MJ's BEST album (I say enjoy `em all). If you're a MJ fan you should strongly consider (if not buying immediately) add this album to your collection. 5/5, very recommended, excellent album.ing so much about Michael Jackson's achievements in the music industry with all the record sales, the awards and current state of record sales it's a little funny to think that Bad was initially considered a failure because it didn't match Thriller!

0749953357|5.0|'Linchpin' is the first book of Seth Godin's that I have read, and doing so made me quickly order a copy of 'Tribes', next on my list. Seth Godin's writing is inspirational, common sense, expansive, intelligent, and fun to read. 'Linchpin' will light a fire under you, and help you to honestly face those parts of yourself that have been afraid to grow, change, or even see the light of day. This book will inspire you to become truly excellent at your art, whatever that art is - growing your business, creating new forms, growing relationships with others, taking leadership roles, and so on.    Godin embraces change, and making conscious changes. He questions the status quo ceaselessly, reminding you that following someone else's path to success will not necessarily be yours too, and that each one of us needs to forge that path for ourselves.    As a full time psychic, healer, and meditation teacher, I tell many of my clients and students to read this book. It is one of the most validating and common sense books about creating that I have run across. I am grateful to Seth Godin for writing it, and hope he sells a zillion copies!
1577314808|5.0|During my last vicious bout of crippling depression, I was recommended The Power of Now by somewhat of a friend who I had never really gotten close to, but has a strong value for his opinion. After a lengthy email about how tortured I felt, he simply sent me the link to the book. No description, not much of an explanation, and no summary. I bought the book on a whim. I was searching for anything at all that could possibly 'save' me. After reading bits and pieces of the book, I began to grasp the concept, but I did not yet feel myself Being.    Finally, a day came around where I was presented with the opportunity to perform a song in front of a live audience, right then and there. Music is my passion, but I always looked relied on the future for progression. \\"I'll perform next week,\\" was my initial thought, until I realized the opportunity was being presented to me Now. I took the leap and played my song. In that moment, sitting in front of the piano, singing into the microphone, I realized I am present.    I feel that The Power of Now has made me realize my true Being. As I discuss any event prior to my feeling of enlightenment, I feel as though \\"...I am talking about some past lifetime or somebody else's life,\\" as Tolle put it in the introduction.     Being only 17 years-old, I feel this book helps me to see the burdens of typical teenager-ism from a point of view that exists outside of my mind. Honestly, it's difficult for me to put the power this book has on me into words, as I have found that words are just carriers of \\"the high-energy frequency that is presence\\".    There's really no way for me to conclude what I'm saying. What I can say though, is that this book hasn't 'saved' me. The book is a lesson on how to 'save' yourself.

OK....)Anyhow, the song was River Queen off of Rock The Rebel/Metal The Devil. I was very intrigued. Catchy sound, Fat Gibson Riffs that sound like Pepper Keenan of COC on Blind, Drums very machine-like with double bass that would give Dave Lombardo or Paul Bostaph a run for the money, yet bluesy with \\"Elvis on Speeders\\" behind the mic. So I started to investigate. Caught their show at Wacken Open Air Festival on youtube. I was Blown away. I am a metal head from a ways back.

But I Still love Old Slayer, Testament, Overkill, Exodus Etc, at the same time I will still listen to everything from Johnny Cash, to Marvin Gaye, To QOTSA, to Tool, to Rogue Wave, to Stereolab, to the Temptations. I love everything. But one thing I admire, is someone who can be original, and keep that burning drive going. I have purchased everything this band has available in the states. Well, This latest Release is lacking the consistant creativity that the prior three albums have. Time Signatures, changes, and transitions are not as crisp. And the songs lack a certain edge and structure that is consistant in their previous releases.<br /><br />The opener comes in with a great sound, but then makes three signature changes, with the third sounding out of place, and unneccessary. The Second Song is okay, using Harmonica for a pretty good dramatic effect. But I don't hear writting that some other band couldn't do. The Third Song, Who They Are has a very Slayer-esque riff, but soon loses momentum, and no longer stands out, like most Volbeat songs do. Fallen is a song about Michael's Father, and it may be an emotional ode to his dad, the song is just very vanilla. Stand outs on the album are 7 Shots featuring Guest Appearances by members of Kreator (Classic German Thrash) and Merciful Fate, but has good emotionalcharacter, and 16 Dollars, with a stand up bass that makes it sound like the Stray Cats On Steroids. Other than those tunes, this release is just lacking. Barney from Napalm Death makes an appearance on Evelyn, which is a great idea, but just sounds out of place and as though they are trying way too hard. And the song Thanks, is just plain bad, and I don't mean cool. Don't get me wrong, I love this band, They are probably the only thing I have been listening to for the past 3 months, I was just dissapointed with the collection here. Where is this Album's \\"Sad Mans Tongue\\", or \\"You Or Them\\", \\"Say Your Number\\", \\"Wild Rover From Hell\\", \\"A Moment Forever\\"  or even \\"Radio Girl\\"? Just not there.  The experimental sound/idea kind of runs a little dry. Jacob Hansen does a fantastic job with production as always(Why haven't we heard more about this extra-ordinary producer), but how many of these new songs will make it onto a new tour, since the best one's feature additional musicians not in the normal lineup? I will continue to support this band, because they are by far the most original thing to come along in quite a while. This release jsut disappointed me. Maybe you'll like it.
0765350386|5.0|I picked up Elantris and the first of the Mistborn trilogy on a whim one day. I'd read everything new by all of my favorite authors, had gone back and re-read most of my favorites, and I was feeling a bit desperate for something new to read. I tend to stick to authors I know or who are recommended to me, but this time, I thought I'd take a chance. If Brandon Sanderson is good enough to finish Jordan's Wheel of Time series, there must be something worth reading, right?    I was very pleasantly amazed. Elantris was impressive, and Mistborn has secured me as a lifelong and enthusiastic fan of the author. The world is strikingly different from most other fantasy environments, and the system of magic is new and fascinating. The characters have hidden depths to them that you only discover as you keep reading the series, and the plot evolves with twists and changes that are unexpected but believable. Part of me can't wait to finish the series and see what happens. Another part wants to drag it out as long as possible so it doesn't end too quickly.
B002LLE3PY|3.0|I listened to the 5.1 mix on a friend's system, and it was awsome! This makes it all the more frustrating that I can't get my system to recognize the disc! Both Red and ItCotCK played great on my DVD players. If anyone out there can offer any help, I'd really appreciate it.
B0000524CY|5.0|This movie is the scariest thing I have ever seen in my life.  I have had a love/hate relationship with it since I saw it as a kid on vhs in the early 80's.  When the re-release came out, I saw it in the theater and was disturbed all over again.  The face of Regan, the music, the whole idea, makes me go cold and weak.  If you like scary, this gives a whole new meaning to the word.  Be prepared...you have never experienced a movie like this.

B001608QVS|4.0|This set is great, it has all the dirty harry films upscaled and remasterd in high defintion, and it looks great for older films. However there is another set on amazon and in stores that came out a year after the Ultimate collector's edition and it has all the films the same discs the same quality video and the same speacial features but dosen't include a little booklet, and a cheap plastic lutinent Calahan badge. If you did'nt buy this yet I would go with that one.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|This isn't so much of a sequel as a tribute to the original Predator movie. Pieces of the classic original are honored in this film such as the music and the overall environment of the movie itself. Some people say this is worse that the two AVP movies, but that's a load of crap. In my opinion this is up to par with the original itself. Just as Aliens was to the original Alien. It has its own story line, with a twist at the end many wouldn't expect. Some critics are upset because you don't get a real look at the predators until at least halfway through through the movie. Hello. You never saw the monster in the original until practically the very end! The whole point of them being hunters so that you can't see them when you're being hunted. This just shows that the director knew how to make this movie. He keeps you at the edge of your seat until the very end. And its almost impossible to guess what will happen next. The bar is definitely set high in the Predator reboot thanks to the release of Predators!
B002KKCWFE|5.0|I am very pleased with my Teva Men's Tanza Outdoor Sandals.  They have a very attractive styling that does not cover your feet with straps. The arch support and cushioning is excellent.  The covert green color offers a refreshing change from the usual brown, tan, and black.  I walk 2 miles a day in them on sidewalks, pavement, and in a shopping mall for exercise and find them to be a great walking sandal.  I have not yet tried them on dirt trails.

B0034JKZ86|3.0|I'm very lucky to have been the perfect age to experience, firsthand, Disney's early 90's Renaissance. I remember finding out about Aladdin for the first time in the previews of the VHS copy of Beauty and the Beast. I remember hearing the song \\"Circle of Life\\" for the first time in the groundbreaking (at the time) trailer for \\"The Lion King,\\" before anyone had ever seen a mandrill holding a lion cub on top of a rock over kneeling animals. I actually remember wondering what Sebastian was saying when he sang \\"Unda-da-sea,\\" and whether King Triton was a good guy or a bad guy. These movies shaped the consciousness of my generation. Just go up to anyone between the ages of 22 and 28 who grew up in the Western World, any frat boy, any prissy girl, any former cheerleader, any computer nerd, and find me one who doesn't know the lyrics to Hakuna Matata. From 1989 to 1995, the question of next year's Disney movie was an exciting topic for everyone I knew. What would the next one be about? And, more importantly, would it be as good, both in my eyes and at the box office, as the one before? And (allowing for the less well-known Rescuers Down Under in 1990) the answer was always \\"yes,\\" until 1995 when suddenly Pocahontas hit the screens, leaving everyone to think, for the first time, \\"Meh.\\"    Starting with Pocahontas, with the exception of Mulan, the films showed a slow and steady decline, trying too hard to be zany (Hercules), dark (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, possibly the worst subject choice ever for a Disney movie), action-packed (Tarzan), expensive (Dinosaur), or offbeat (Lilo and Stitch)... In short, trying too hard to be anything but the instant classics of the early 90's. Things went from bad to worse (in a curiously correlated decline of quality and box office performance), until finally, following the fiasco of \\"Home on the Range\\" (am I the only one who saw it?), Disney announced it would no longer make traditional animated films, in a move that, to me, still soundslike Ferrari announcing it's going to keep making everything except cars. Yes, there were still Pixar movies, but for all their wit and beauty, these always felt like high-tech consolation prizes for anyone who grew up with magic carpets and singing candelabras. With the end of 2-D animation came the end of a collective, global childhood, and for a few years it looked as if, much like the real one, the Disney childhood was gone for good.    Until John Lasseter, the brilliant visionary behind Pixar, announced a new dawn of hope for Disney animation. The first project for the newly revived traditional feature animation department would be a real fairy tale, hand-drawn for the screen, with an old-school villain, a love interest, a fairy-godmother figure, talking animals, and, yes, even song-and-dance numbers in which the characters suddenly break into music. In short: a real Disney movie. And the result, ladies and gentlemen, titled \\"The Princess and the Frog,\\" just came out in theaters yesterday, following a two-week limited release in NY and LA. Of course, as anyone who's read this post so far must have already guessed, I wasted no time in seeing it the day it came to my city.    And here's what I thought:    \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" is good. Yes, it's actually good, and anyone who's prayed for the return of traditional hand-drawn animation should see it without fear of disappointment. The movie looks beautiful, without even a hint of CGI (though I'm sure there must be some lurking here and there below the surface). The characters and backgrounds exist, seamlessly and breathlessly, in the wonderfully lawless physical universe where Ariel sang under water of her longing for the human world, where Mrs. Potts managed to look plump and made of porcelain at the same time. The movie is a visual journey through the glorious folklore of New Orleans, making ample use of the mythological arsenal at its disposal, from the dangers of the bayou to the double-edged dealings ofvoodoo, from Mardi Gras to gumbo. All the best Disney movies create self-contained universes where you simply want to immerse yourself, and \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" achieves this with class and charm. The stylized characters who walk down the street and into the restaurant where the heroine works wouldn't belong in any other movie, not even Aladdin or The Little Mermaid, and yet they're unmistakably Disney.    The entire feel of the movie is as bouncy and buoyant as its visuals, thanks in great part to its hardworking and determined heroine, Tiana. Much has already been said about her historical role as Disney's first African-American leading woman, but few reviewers seem to mention another very important aspect of the character: she's an exceptionally admirable protagonist. Regardless of race, color, or background, few Disney leads of either gender show as much pluck, energy, and perseverance as Tiana. As the movie points out, she's been so busy working all her life that she can't even dance! Why does no one consider that to be innovative for a Disney princess? Yes, Tiana's black, but that's just one of several reasons for which she's such a great addition to the canon. The characters around her are all serviceable, at the very least, but the movie's most memorable character is undoubtedly Tiana.    Now, I've mentioned my two favorite aspects of the movie, but I chose my words carefully when saying \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" is good. Sadly, it's not great. It's obviously head and shoulders above any hand-drawn feature the studio has released in the past 10 years, but it's little more than halfway to the brilliance of the early 90's pictures. One very noticeable difference lies in the music. The movie has numerous songs, and they all contribute to its overall stylistic cohesion, but they sadly justified my misgivings when I first heard they would be written by Randy Newman (of the \\"Toy Story\\" soundtrack) instead of Alan Menken (of everyone's favorite songs ever). What can you tell me about the song \\"You've Got a Friend in Me\\" from Toy Story? How does it compare, say, with \\"Part of that World,\\" \\"Kiss the Girl,\\" \\"Prince Ali,\\" or \\"A Whole New World?\\" Fatally, the show-stopping production numbers in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" invite comparisons the music just can't live up to. This isn't a statement about the quality of the composer's work, but there's something distinctly lyrical, memorable, and infectious about other Disney soundtracks that just doesn't happen in this movie.    There are also some weaknesses in the story and character department. Most of the great Disney stories can be summarized in a very short sentence that every character's motivations can be deployed around. Though it's very clear what Tiana's conflict is (she wants to open a restaurant but doesn't have enough money), the balance of the plot is surprisingly complicated. Even the bad guy, Doctor Facilier, who's been given all the trappings of a great Disney villain (and score: even a song!), has too many agendas, too many tricks, and too many issues of his own, to seep under the viewers' skin. The love interest raises more questions than he answers (Where's he from? Why, if he's a Prince, does he have no money? Whom does he want to marry? Why?). For all the crap good old Prince Charming in Snow White received for having no personality, at least everyone knew exactly what he was about. The movie's comic relief is, though it pains me to say so, unfunny and forgettable, and it's instantly obvious why these characters are there. The genie, for example, had soul beneath all the jokes, and, from a purely pragmatic point of view, there'd be no Aladdin story without him.    Characters' motivations are not the only issue in the story department. The plot involves many deals, many conditions, many detours, many distractions. For example, before anything has even happened to her, Tiana finds that she can afford the down payment on the building she wants for her restaurant by selling cakes to her friend Charlotte, who wants the cakes in order to win the Prince's affections - but then Tiana is outbid and she must match the other prospective buyer's offer before it's too late. What happened to straight up \\"Belle needs to break the spell!\\" or \\"Simba needs to reclaim the kingdom?\\" There are so many technicalities in this movie that I'm still not sure what exactly sealed the characters' fates at the end (for both the good guys and the villain). And the vast majority of the plot seems to rest on the shoulders of Charlotte, the ditzy rich childhood friend, who's unwittingly at the center of several convoluted schemes simply because her dad has a lot of money. Again, the simple universality of Ariel's dream, or Cinderella's, for that matter, is far more engaging, not to say intelligible (especially for children, while we're at it).    Nonetheless, the Princess and the Frog is pure, well-intentioned, and fun. It's not grand, it's not spectacular, it's not haunting, and it's trying to resume the legacy of movies that were all of these things. But in spite of its shortcomings, its release is still the best news that's come out of Disney in a long time.

B003E6K1VK|5.0|Compact, stylish & functional is what the FiiO E7 is all about.  It is an amplifier/DAC all in one nice compact package for under a C note! Tested it out and it really brings the voice and instruments onto a wider soundstage.  Included with it is a black perfect fitting silicone skin, soft velvet pouch case, 3.5mm male connector, black rubber stretch band to mount your E7 together with your Ipod and a USB mini connector to charge your E7. Just a real nice package. The instruction manual is minimal and the writing is small. I needed a magnifying glass to read it! But the operational sequence was easy enough to figure out! I also have an Airhead amp and it also is great sounding and cost the same as the E7.  But the Airhead is not a DAC and not as high tech as the E7. It is difficult for me to hear any real difference between the two devices both sound really good. The Airhead works on 4 AAA batteries and a wall adapter transformer.  The E7 has an internal lithium rechargeable battery that can be charged by a USB port. It takes around 5 hours to completely recharge it. It is supposed to last up to 80 hours depending on the drain caused by the efficiency of the headphones you are using. I have not yet tested this number but will be trying to over the next month with my Sennheiser 600 headphones and Koss Porta pro open air headphones.  I would also like to talk about the OLED display. It is real functional and looks great. I read that this type of display burns out much faster than regular LED displays. The solution to this is to keep the display on for a minimal amount of time while listening to your music. This can be done by enabling the \\"Key Lock\\" function in Menu. It is the 4th choice when scrolling down. I set mine for 30 seconds. The display will shut off after 30 seconds. Hit and hold the Menu  button and it will unlock your E7 so you can make adjustments to your E7 once again. Seems to be a great buy but durability is something I will be testing out over the next month or two.  Hope to update my post with further info in a month or two.    UPDATE: 2/20/2011 - E7 has performed to expectations. No problems yet. Have not used it that much recently. Charged it 1 time and it seems to be efficient in power handling based on the 20 or so hours I have used it in the last 3 months.  The price has stayed the same and the other positive reviews seem pretty much in line with my views on this device. The bad reviews seem totally unjustified because the E7 does in fact amplify clean sound and does provide a bigger soundstage. The main purpose of a DAC is to correct the unnatural spatial sound produced by headphones into a more balanced overall sound as heard when \\"not\\" using headphones. I believe that this has been achieved by this portable DAC at a reasonable cost. The difference is subtle but that is what these devices do. If your phones are poor quality only much better headphones are going to make a big difference and there is a limit to that also.

These guys have stuck with it, and with each other through the years, and created a musical legacy that will endure. Plus, they're funny and the bonus material is great too.

0385523386|3.0|After graduating from college, Piper Kerman was feeling a bit restless. It was time to join the 9-5 rat race and settle down, but she wasn't ready. While muddling through this directionless period in her life, Kerman meets and begins a relationship with a woman named Nora. Nora, as she would explain to Kerman, was employed by a drug kingpin. Nora ran drugs and drug money all over the world, and soon, Kerman would find herself helping Nora. Transporting money to Brussels or Chicago didn't seem like a big deal, but when Nora begins pushing Kerman to become deeper entrenched in the drug running, Kerman flees the lifestyle and heads back to the USA.<br /><br />Several years go by and Kerman is living in New York City. She's got a boyfriend and a great job. Life is going well for Kerman, until two federal marshalls appear on her doorstep to announce that Nora had been busted for drug running and had turned rat. Kerman had just been indicted for her earlier misdeeds.<br /><br />Shocked and scared, Kerman is facing serious jail time. She cuts a deal and is given a 13-month sentence which she begins serving more than 10 years after she committed her crimes. What follows is Kerman's account of daily life in a federal women's prison and how she survived her time on the inside.<br /><br />I saw this book recommended by a favorite author and so I had to check it out. I am glad that I did. Piper Kerman's account of her crimes and her time in jail is an honest and interesting narrative. It is not often that a spotlight is shone on women in prison, particularly the federal system, and that is what Kerman's book does. If you are expecting gritty accounts of prisoner-on-prisoner or guard-on-prison rape and abuse, look elsewhere. There is definitely grit in the telling of her story, but none of the cliches that one might expect from such a book. The beauty and tragedy of the prison system is exposed without the sensationalism and is told with a voice that rings of truth.

B00402FGE4|5.0|I've watched most of the first season and have to say I'm really impressed, and appreciative.  A Stargate transports a group of people, who are fleeing an attack, to an ancient space ship; but that's where the similarities with other SG productions end.  The series continues in the trend of darker, soap-box-style themes and filming environments that started in the early 1990's with DS9.  It also continues along the lines of character-driven space-set drama, as opposed to wars-in-space.  It does follow the trend toward more sophisticated plots, and is ultimately an epic adventure.  It departs (thankfully) from ongoing trends in that it is less concerned about assembling a focus-group-driven, please-everyone, set of characters.  Many have commented how much the show is like BSG, and I agree.  Although, at this stage, it does not have the directing, photographic and other production-related genius of BSG, it is more believable.  I've high hopes for this series, and applaud their courageous choice to present a believable cast.  Very good stories with good acting.  If I had one wish, it would be that the environments were better lit.  If they get any darker, one will have to sit in complete darkness to see anything.

B003V6L94Q|4.0|The Zac Brown Band has such a fresh, exuberant sound that it makes you want to start dancing in the living room and beat chop sticks on your coffee table.  The songs have the energy and warmth of the Dixie Chicks, Jimmy Buffett, Alabama and Alan Jackson at their best.  The songs are a celebration of life, the singing has an ease that touches you and the playing has amazing energy and enthusiasm.    This is a better record than The Foundation, because it skips the goofy cuts (which were OK for one or two listens). It's not a masterpiece.  The lyrics are fairly lightweight.  But for whistling while you work, for a party, or when we have any other kind of fun in mind, I'm guessing this will be a go-to record for many of us for years to come.
0307386171|3.0|Two redundantly boring but fearful newlyweds test out sexual intercourse. It does not go well. Lovemaking is awkward and ends with a disgusting premature ejaculation. Separately they run out into the night, onto the pebbly beach by their seaside hotel. Florence, a talented concert musician, suggests they try just living together, in what a few years later would be called an open marriage. Edward, a recent history graduate, is appalled and angered at the suggestion. They dissolve their marriage and never see each other again, though they do think of each other in after years with wistful regret. End of story.<br /><br />The author's slow work-up to the bad climax--recounting in painstaking detail how they met, how they were raised, and how each one feared the challenges of life without ever learning to articulate that fear--parallels the young couple's frustration as they approach the wedding bed. It is a clever literary trick, but not one I would like to see repeated. Tease us for ten pages if you wish, but not for a hundred-plus. Usually McEwan's lush prose quickly engages me with the lives of his stiff, self-absorbed characters, but here all his rolling exposition just made my eyes glaze over.<br /><br />McEwan's main goal, I think, was to give us a slice of cultural history. He wanted to tell us about a state of mind that prevailed among middle-class newlyweds up to the mid-1960s. For McEwen, young men and women saw marriage as an opportunity to take on a new but recognizable role, a role that could be learned out of a book, like those cloying advice booklets on sex that Florence reads. Supple, creative, articulate thinking is beyond Florence and Edward's ability. I feel McEwen overstates his case. He makes Florence and Edward duller, in every way, than they really had to be. Maybe even more than they could have been, given that they've just come out of several years of conservatory and university in central London.<br /><br />Finally, the end of the story is unnecessarily disappointing. It's another tricky downer, like the ending of Atonement, where you find out that the brief but happy wartime romance never actually took place.g. It's another tricky downer, like the ending of Atonement, where you find out that the brief but happy wartime romance never actually took place.

Unlike \\"Till the sun...\\" this is a great piece of Americana.  I'm not surprised to see him touring with Levon Helm, because that is a perfect fit for the band that produced this album.    I think he should stick to this blues-based, gospel- and country-tinged style.  It brings out the best in his voice and his songwriting!

I just don't think any of them will be bad, but that's just me.     BTW, the best recipe out of Nigella Express is Pea and Pesto Soup. Talk about comfort food! I make my own pesto with fresh basil I've grown and freeze it so I can have as much as I want whenever I want, long as I have some frozen peas. I've also toted the soup in a food jar (just like Nigella did on the show!) and enjoyed it during the day--even during jury duty. You can't go wrong with this book or any other Nigella book. This lady knows her stuff.
B001QB9H10|4.0|I'm gonna start by saying the cover is a lie! The main girl, Valentina, NEVER hold a gun! Actually she never does ANYTHING but sit around, get high, sleep and be annoying and her \\"English\\" is crap, glad I had subtitles. Jason Stathan is once again smooth hotness. The main baddie, Robert Knepper, total droolfest, and good fight scene at the end. The driving once again awesome, fight scenes all well done, and Stathan IS the one going them, not a stunt double, by HIS choice! But the very end bugged me, but this one I won't tell cause I think people should see it ;)  4 Stars for great action, cinematography and acting, not 5 for the ugly chick.
0439023513|4.0|First off, let me start by saying I was a fan of the first two books. It probably took me   about a week to read each of them because I found myself able to set them down. An uncommon  thing with the first two books I know. Nevertheless, I was a fan and I enjoyed them and  greatly anticipated the release of the final book. For me, Mockingjay was the best of the  three. Finishing it in just two days, I was unable to put it down.     Mockingjay kept me on the edge of my seat and flipping page after page. There were times   that didn't hold as much excitement as others, but that's to be expected. I think the book   would've been better without the epilogue, but that's just my opinion.
B0000041Z3|4.0|What a pity that Jean Sibelius' seven symphonies have been receiving less attention than they did in the height of his popularity in the 1950s and 60s. His career began as something of a talented Tchaikovsky clone, and developed into a unique voice, which was not prolific (Sibelius went into a very early retirement after seven symphonies), but cannot be mistaken for anything else.    Lorin Maazel tackled this complete cycle in the 60s during a period of intense association with the Vienna Philharmonic. Maazel has always been a variable interpreter, and this set is no exception. He's at his best in the bracing, uniquely Sibelian, world of the 4th and the 7th symphonies. His take on the 4th is as chilly and Nordic as one would want in this symphony, and his 7th shows incredible sense of flow and concentration from first note to last. The 5th also shows a grip on symphonic architecture, but he has strong competition from Bernstein (New York, not the sluggish 1980s rendition in Vienna),  and Koussevitzky in Boston.     The first two symphonies, where ripe, romantic elements bubble to the surface, appeal to Maazel's sense of drama, with tympany crashing and tempi surging. In the 1st, it is most welcome. The 2nd comes off reasonably well, but the more atmospheric elements starting to appear in Sibelius' writing are given less emphasis, to the detriment of the overall experience as far as I am concerned.    It's in the 6th, and much of the 3rd, where Maazel really misses the mark. The extroversion that he brings to these pieces seems largely inappropriate, given the fact that Sibelius had long since abandoned the overt romanticism of symphonies 1 and 2.  The 3rd is a transitional work, but Maazel's traversal heaves and surges in the outer movements, and dashes through the sparse and haunting second movement. The 6th symphony, a beautiful, crystalline creation, would be a total disaster were it not for the gorgeous playing of the Vienna strings in the first movement. From there, something goes wrong at every turn, with Maazel's coarse tempo changes, and almost vulgar, brash playing from the tympany and brass, go completely against the grain of the work.    Overall, this is a good introduction to Sibelius, but listeners who get serious about the composer will want to compensate for this set's rough sledding by investing in Osmo Vanska's (or possibly Karajan's) 6th. For alternatives to the 3rd, look into Blomstedt on Decca or Okko Kamu on DGG.
B00006HBUA|4.0|Contrary to some other reviews that Scooby Doo follows a formula of battling ghosts, demons, zombies, and terrifying creepies, only to find the culprit in simple explanation of a hidden force, usually the town outcast, you might want to take into regard the animated Scooby Doo On Zombie Island where they find that the mansion they are investigating is indeed haunted with real ghosts, and the island is indeed inhabited by real life zombies, among other things that should scare the very young like women turning into cat people. Therefore, this movie breaks no new ground by giving us real monsters for the Mystery Inc. clan to discover or battle, and Im sure that any nasty little dialogue heard hear has not already been addressed to the very young by simply going to regular school with other kids. All the cast members do their very best, and appear expertly picked for the parts. Even CGI Scooby gives a great little performance that makes you forget, he's not even there when they filmed it. Great cameos of latest music rock era to add to the soundtrack.
0316098337|3.0|My review will be an incomplete one. There are qualities of this novel worthy of praise but since this has already been done hundreds of times in Amazon, I see no point in repeating similar arguments. Instead, I want to focus on certain things about the novel that I didn't like.    My main criticism is about the author's choice of description for Jack, the protagonist. The novel starts with Jack announcing he turned 5. In the first few sentences we notice what an unusual child Jack is because he is saying something like \\"Last year I was 4. The year before I was 3, before that I was 2. And before that I was 1. And before that I was zero. Was I  minus one before that? And minus 2 and so on before that?\\" It would be extremely unusual for a child who just turned 5 to have a solid understanding of negative numbers. And in the following pages we get more of a demonstration of Jack's abilities. That night, when Nick comes and has sex with his mother, Jack, in the other part of the room counts the number of times the bed creaks and the reader is shown that he can easily count, if I remember correctly, to 227. There are many other incidents throughout the book where his overdeveloped math skills are displayed. Much later in the book he demonstrates to a psychologist that he can count to past 1 million! At one place, as the narrator he says \\"I practiced my multiplying and dividing\\". Evidently, he can do multiplication and division. But his development is not limited to math. Very early in the book we are shown that he can write and read fluently and he has such an advanced level of language skills that he can understand fine differences between words and make word-plays of them. For example, when his mother puts an ice cube on her aching tooth, Jack wants her to give him an ice cube by acting like he has a toothache too. Her mother says \\"if you want to suck on an ice cube you don't have to have a toothache, don't scare me like this.\\" and he says \\"okay\\". When her mother jokes\\"liar liar, pants on fire\\" he says \\"I wasn't lying, I was pretending\\". A child who just turned 5 doesn't know words like pretend. Even if one such example would be unusual but possible, when we see many other demonstrations of Jack's language skills, we realize that he is a very unusual child. For example, at one point he says \\"Tuesdays and Fridays always smell of vinegar\\". Obviously, Jack not only knows that days are different with different names, but he also understands that they are grouped into 7's and he is able to keep track of them as they come and go.    After several such displays of his amazing math or language skills far ahead of his years, I found myself wondering if the author's choice of making Jack such a genius would be contributing to the overall harmony of the story later on. Was it necessary for the development of the story that he be so advanced? I will get to that later.    What disturbed me continuously throughout the book however is, the inconsistency in Jack's language abilities. Although Jack is described at the beginning of the book as a very advanced child and this description is reinforced by many examples throughout the book, there are also many other situations, especially toward the end of the book, where we realize that he is lacking the most fundamental language skills. He makes many mistakes such as \\"he brung me\\", \\"we never cutted her\\", or says things like fasterer, or beautifullest. More shockingly for the reader, we are shown at one point that he doesn't understand the third person, presumably because the author wanted to emphasize the fact that he never spoke to anybody other than his mother. When his mother is making him practice what to say to people outside, she says \\"tell them you and me were kidnapped\\" and he repeats \\"you and me were kidnapped\\". She says \\"no, don't say you and me, say you and your mother\\". She is trying to make him say that \\"my mother and I were kidnapped\\". But he keeps saying \\"you and me were kidnapped\\" or\\"you and your mother were kidnapped\\". Now, even though Jack has never spoken to anybody, he is regularly watching TV so he is exposed to conversational situations. Besides, Jack is shown to be a very, very advanced boy. But he makes the simplest mistakes like these repeatedly. Incessant displays of his advanced skills on one page and simplest mistakes on another, makes him an unrealistic character and very annoyingly, breaks the flow of the story. I suppose the author wanted to depict him as a child with an unbalanced development. Since he lacked any formal education or interaction with other people, he is behind his age in some respects, and far ahead in some others. But if this was her intention, the author made a very bad job of portraying him this way. We are not shown, or made to feel, that Jack's development is unbalanced. This is an understanding we reach not because the author shows it, but actually because she doesn't show it. We find ourselves thinking that \\"she was trying to show Jack's development as unbalanced\\".    Another thing about the story that I found very unrealistic is Jack and her mother's escape plan and their execution of it. I am not going to go into many details of it but basically, the plan is for the boy to pretend that he is dead. The mother wraps him up with a carpet and tells Nick that he is dead. Nick is supposed to take the body out to bury him somewhere and while on the back of the truck the boy is supposed to free himself of the ties that wrap the carpet and jump out of the truck and find somebody and tell them the story, with his poor (or is it advanced?) language skills. There are many things that could go wrong with this plan. What if Nick opens the carpet and checks his body? What if he kicks the body to see if there is a response? What if he handles it so carelessly and tosses it somewhere and the boy hits his head and really dies? What if he passes out in the package and Nick actually buries him? What if Nick realizes that he is alive but he kills him and buries him? What if Jack jumps off the truck and hit the ground hard and actually dies? What if after he jumps he is hit by another car while he is trying to stop someone, as her mother instructs him, a boy who just turned 5 and has never been outside the room. There are many such \\"what if\\" questions that need to be addressed. Of course, daring escape plans might work against all odds but by not addressing any of these questions, the author again, is not \\"showing\\" the story, but just gives us the successful result.    The rest of my criticism is actually a reflection of my personal taste and others may not share it. Even if the description of Jack as a character wasn't inconsistent and he was kept as a very advanced child throughout the book, I think that would be a poor choice. The fact that Jack is very intelligent wouldn't contribute anything to the story. This is not a story about how smart he is. This is a story, or rather should have been a story, about how his perception of his surroundings is so diametrically opposed to his mother's. His mother sees themselves as prisoners and she is unhappy. Jack is not aware of that and he is a happy child. He says \\"we have thousands of things to do everyday\\". For my taste, the story should have accentuated this difference of their perception. Perhaps, the mother should have planned that daring escape and tried to convince her son, who didn't want to leave. And perhaps at the end he should have obeyed her and something should have gone terribly wrong and the novel ended on a tragic note. Eliminating all the things that they went through after their escape, but instead, making this a story about the difference in their view of the world around them would have been a very challenging writing. But if achieved, this would have been a true masterpiece.
081297381X|5.0|Excellent Book, challenge the \\"NORMAL CURVE\\" mind, if you feel you can't live without predicting the future, or reading what others \\"forecast\\", please don't read this book, your brain might have a short circuit. In more \\"scientific\\" words normal science meets revolutionary science.
B002ZG9968|2.0|A few genuinely funny moments overshadowed by too much vulgar language and crude gags.  J-Lo is bright and funny, but this project seemed beneath her.  Not a good moral lesson for younger family members.
B003X73QA8|5.0|The Suburbs is not an album you can listen to once and fully appreciate. It is not an album that should be reviewed after one listen.  There were songs that I didnt fully appreciate on the first listen that made sense and blew me away after a few listens..    I would place Suburbs as Arcade Fire's second best album.. after Funeral.  Sprawl II is phenomenal and up there with any of their best songs.  Half Light II is great. City with no children is as well.    This is an album that must be listened to from start to finish. Again and again.      5 stars easily for the album of the year.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Great performances and good effort at explaining the jumbled lineages of Europe's royal houses.  Very 'watchable' for our younger family members...entertaining and informative.  Left us wishing for a part two to follow this royal couple's later years.
0793563836|4.0|Ive only just dived into this book but I like it so far. I only have two issues with it. First it mentions positioning which is poorly implemented and adds confusion. Secondly, and this is more of a personal preference, I dislike quick introduction of sharps and flats. I feel it works better when you have learned all the notes on the first frets and are very comfortable with them before working in sharps and flats. Other than that the book is a awesome.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|First, stop it! This \\"Predators\\" is not better than the first \\"Predator\\"! The predecessor kills the movie on cast alone. Secondly, this movie is NOT better than the two AVP movies. They add to the Predator familiy of movies.    With that said, this was a fun and exciting movie! One that fits in nicely with the collection. Hey, if you're a fan...you're a fan! Has anyone ever wondered (or looked up the fact) why these movies do better on indvd/bluray? Because people love them and they don't need to speend forty bucks at the movies when then kow that they're going to bring it home!    This movie rocks and falls nicely in the current order of released Predator films. If you're a fan...you're a fan; go get it!
0786955570|5.0|got this game and played it friday night (10/15/10). we played it alot. our first play was a learning experiance. the second we were getting our legs (you can see where this is going). we started playing the 4th time and I can say we had a blast. this game allows you to rule it up or play as is. we had a blast playing it. and the game night began at 5:30 PM and ended 2:13 AM the next morning. My friends and I cant wait for the next game coming or an expansion to this one. I highly recomend this game.    Now WHY I gave it 4.9 Out of 5 is theres not realy many adventures in the adventure book.

B00338QENI|5.0|This biography is marvelously well-written and the narrative consistently compelling. However, as I have protested with other Kindle editions, I must repeat for this one as well that there are no photographs or illustrations in the Kindle edition which I purchased at its full price. I understand this is the fault/choice of the publisher, in this case Crown, but I find it unacceptable--with today's technology there is no reason why booklovers who purchase a Kindle non-fiction or biography edition at its full price should be deprived of photos and/or illustrations. Shame on Crown and shame on Amazon Kindle.    [[ASIN:B003NHSYLE Verdi's Dream]]
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This album is brilliant and does not disappoint. I often find myself skipping songs on other CDs, because there are really only a few songs that I absolutely love, but this album is fantastic from the first song to the last one. It contains a great balance of songs, and it just \\"rocky\\" enough to lift you up when you are driving in your car, while at the same time being appropriate to be played with kids in the backseat. One of the best buys in a long time and definitely highly recommended!!!!!!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I love Generation Kill! It's very well done. I researched others places to buy it. However I noticed that amazon always had a great sale on it which I did not find anywhere else. As always it shipped quickly.
0316077054|5.0|We Loved Beautiful Darkness.   The description of the mystery and beauty of the Coastal settings is brilliant.  The dialogue between small town characters is classic.  This book will be read in decades to come...
0316098337|5.0|Prior to reading this book, I read \\"Freedom\\" by Jonathan Franzan and I was very disappointed by all the hype and lauds for \\"Freedom\\".  Then, I heard a review for \\"Room\\" and immediately downloaded it to my Kindle.  Wow!  \\"Room\\" certainly deserves more hype and attention.  While the situation described in the book is plausible (we've heard similar true stories), the point of view of a precocious 5 year old really gives it a unique voice.  Jack's innocence is heartwarming.  Placing ourselves in his socks (shoes aren't needed in his 11 x 11 shed), we understand that if you don't know any different life, you can be happy in the one you have.  We also feel the terror of the real world and it is easy to relate to it as a young child whose reality is shattered and now must relearn how to live in this big new world.  I promise you that you will look at the mundane is a very different way after reading this terrific novel.
B002NUULNG|5.0|This movie was great, the animation, action, art style, and overall story were all great. This was my first time seeing it since i was only four when it first came out (95' i believe). The visual quality on blu-ray is top notch. As other reviews have stated the CG is a little distracting, but doesn't take away from the overall experience of the movie. The sound and visual quality are impeccable. Overall this was a really good movie and i fully recommend this to anyone who is interested in anime.
0385338694|4.0|I found this novel absolutely adoreable.  The main character - Samantha - was charming and witty, and I didn't want the story to end.  I liked this novel much more than \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" which I read right before starting this one.  It was light and fun, with just the right amount of silliness to make it a perfect read for a rainy day!
B001VNB54A|1.0|I cancelled HBO after their cancelling of Deadwood without a decent ending, but I looked forward to the Pacific and watched it at my daughters.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! What was HBO thinking? I know this isn't Band of Brothers, but with the same people in charge you would expect something  comparable. Not even close. This is pure rubbish with graphic sex scenes that add no value to the series. The series protrays the marines in a very  very negative manner and it is an insult to those who fought and died in the Pacific campaigns. The acting isn't good so it is hard to connect to the  characters, plus it jumps around to much. I purchased Band of Brothers to watch whenever I want to, but this mess is something I won't buy or watch ever again.
1416594787|5.0|I have been an atheist since I was 19, and came to read this book already convinced of the fact of evolution.  My primary motivation for reading the book was to catch up on the current evidence supporting evolution, which makes constant advancements.  When in conversation, I also want to be able to specifically articulate to others why I believe as I do, and not give them unsatisfactory boilerplate answers.  The book helped me achieve both of these goals, and did so in an entertaining way that caused me to read the book almost as quickly as a good fiction novel. I liked the way Dawkins provides evidence for evolution from a large variety of different perspectives, including molecular biology, comparisons between existing species, fossil evidence, embryology, and even plate tectonics.  Dawkins also explains experiments in which evolution actually takes place before our eyes.  I was especially impressed by the experiments involving several separate generations of bacteria in which one of the lines evolved to digest and use a non-glucose chemical as fuel.  As a by-product of reading this book, you will also gain much knowledge on the biology and anatomy of animals, including ourselves.  Dawkins demonstrates the beauty of the evolutionary point of view, which in my view is far more practical, real, and elegant than the creationist faith.    Finally, I have the utmost respect for Dawkins as a scientist and a writer.  He has fought for the cause of science, and done so in an admirable way; not with the puffery of a political pundit, but with the objective reasoning that is heart of all science.  I've seen him promoting this book in interviews with people all the way from Bill Mahar to Bill O'Reilly; in all of them, he has held his own and done a great job of spreading the light of science.    I am better for having read this book.
0553805371|5.0|Well written, deep and humorous, makes an up-to-date presentation for the educated layman of most recent developments in frontier physics.   The courage and the honesty of the authors in addressing the basic questions of human life and the competent and sound answers they propose without any surrender to the weak thinking of most philosophers and of all the insipient defenders of religions makes of this book a true pearl within the international landscape of popular scientific literature.
B000002IAZ|4.0|Most people will buy this because they know \\"For What It's Worth.\\" I bought it on Vinyl decades ago because I knew a few of their songs. I'm now buying all three CDS the band released.    \\"For What It's Worth\\" is an excellent song but, as a friend puts it, obvious. It's played on classic rock and oldies stations ad naseum. A powerful song, it's been drained of its meaning from overplay.    I knew \\"Mr. Soul\\" and \\"Bluebird\\" when I got the album, but hearing \\"Kind Woman\\" and this version of \\"Rock N Roll Woman\\" was incredible. My 80s mix tapes included a lot of these songs.    Buy this if you just want \\"For What It's Worth\\" or a few other songs, but consider buying the three original albums if you're a music afficianado.

B002SJIO4A|4.0|I got a little bit motion sick during District 9. I was pretty disappointed it didn't seem to be about anything. It was a standard, shoot-em up buddy movie. One partner just happens to be an alien. It wasn't till the very end, when you wonder if aliens from the home world are coming back, that it hints at being a Sci Fi movie, or a movie that has implications for all of us or one examining changes in society. Well there was the main character, Wikus, burning all the alien eggs. . .<br /><br />There is a theme to District 9, tho. It is about one thing, and one thing only. Building up and exalting the main character, Wikus. It 'pimps' him. I even wonder if that was the insider name for the movie during production. Wikus is a follower of sorts. He's an every-man, perhaps. He's not concerned with petty or personal politics. It might even be physical, he's a thin man. The counter-argument (and it's an easy one to make) might be that he grows or changes, during the movie. The movie goes pretty fast. I think it merely reveals his character. Even when he finally goes against type, is finally pushed too far, and he blindly lashes out at his alien partner, I think even this sells him. Even he can be pushed too far.<br /><br />It was absolutely an incredibly well-made movie, it accomplishes it's task very well. Sadly, it has to descend into a shoot-em up to accomplish it's goal? Wikus must become a master of arms - really cool ones - to become acceptable? Yes, a very sad commentary on our times. Does he even have to become an alien, in the end, before he is really 'real'? It's possible, that instead this movie was targeted toward folks like the main character in the movie (and folks like me). The movie isn't about selling Wikus, it's about selling a might-is-right, tattoo crazed world to folks like Wikus. It never hurts to admire strength. It's working out so well for us.<br /><br />I'm going to say I agree with those who note the racism examined in District 9. I don't really care. . . not at all. I'm a white racist, I guess. Or perhaps I just think there are already enough folks concerned about 'racism' as it is. But I do 'agree' with the idea - if you accept the notion that the alien prawns are stand-ins for another race. Much has been written about how they are. District 9 presents them as pretty base and even animal-like, both on the ship and then in the camps. Perhaps I missed something in the movie, the process where the prawns or refugees are 'dehumanized' against their better wishes. Almost forgot the scene where African girls prostitute themselves to aliens, and does it help that the Black Africans in the movie are portrayed as cannibals and even worse? Should I repeat that sentence again. . ? Perhaps the movie makers feel racism can only be counteracted by further racism? Well of course they do. We all know liberals are the ones who make movies. This isn't discrimination against conservatives, it's just a coincidence. Although one it would seem in need of celebration.<br /><br />One of the paradoxes of the movie is that a lot of reviewers comment about how Wikus is evil or kind of shady. Even surrounded by corporate henchmen, bile aliens, and sadistic cannibals, he's still the bad guy! Can brainwashing be overridden? Perhaps it can't be. This movie tries really hard. At the risk of an even larger number of negative votes, for the older readers, I'm going to quote someone else who is a lot more articulate than I am,<br /><br />\\"Apparently many uber Liberals do well on the IQ tests which means they can assimilate and process bad information faster than the average. But if they encounter conflicting good information can they deprocess the bad and replace it with the good faster than the average? Doesn't seem so. In fact it appears that they cannot deal with conflicting information at all. Is there a test that can attach a useful number to this mental defect\\"?<br /><br />This movie doesn't do anything but exalt the main character of the movie (it does it well). The problem is I'm not sure this movie can really convince us that Wikus' district has 9.f the movie (it does it well). The problem is I'm not sure this movie can really convince us that Wikus' district has 9.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific was an excellet tribute to the men who fought in the Pacific.  It is based on 2 books of 2 men who the series centers around... Sledge and Leckie (I am currently reading Sledge's, \\"with the old breed\\").  For anyone that compares this to Band of Brothers, there is a lot more background drama here.  Here you see families and loved ones.  What you aren't seeing is what jungle warfare did to these men.  You can't recreate 115 degree weather in a movie and expect the viewer to understand.  Plus, the psychological affects these men went through is only touched upon.  Imagine being the first wave of marines on Guadalcanal and then the navy pulls out, without resupplying food, water, ammo, etc, and then being left to fight the enemy.<br /><br />Overall, it is an excellent movie and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  My only suggestion for someone who hasn't seen this yet... don't start watching it with any expectations from Band of Brothers.  It was a different war and this was a different story.<br /><br />Remember, the 2 guys whose books this is based on died several years ago...what these men did was amazing.
B003UERZ88|5.0|Disclaimer: I'm a huge Halford fan.  Much of Halford (and Priest's) music is in the 'me against the world', pick yourself up by the bootstraps and fight on vein. No different here, with much of that in a sports theme: Undisputed (boxing), Made of Metal (NASCAR), Matador (bullfighting). Personally, I like this stuff, especially while working out. Then Halford throws you a curveball, with the personal confession \\"25 Years\\" (apparently about his alcoholism).    You get 14 Halford songs for $10. A great deal. Halford is a virtuoso performer whose talent exceeds the metal genre; here he takes metal to varied directions. All very enjoyable.    If you think his 'voice is shot,' listen to the hellish shriek of The Mower to hear how wrong you are. If you want a sound-alike replacement singer to walk down 1980's metal memory lane, buy the new Accept album. If you want to be surprised and entertained, buy Made of Metal
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|This chip was my first try at overclocking, and it was simple.  All I did was raise the voltage a hair to 4.16 volts, well within spec, and change the multiplier to 20x.  Presto, 4ghz.  Verified stable by a 12h Prime95 run, and been running for weeks at this speed.  It's blistering fast, ripped a DVD the other day while playing a game, and the cores weren't even sweating.  This replaced a stock Q6600, and my fps at least tripled in handbrake.  Amazing!  The extra two cores really do make a huge difference.  Highly recommended.    Note: I did not even try to use the stock cooler, first thing I did after thermal paste was put a Noctua DH-U14 on it.  Keeps this thing so scary cool it's insane.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|I think is their best album so far, but in a tight race with their second album \\"Cease to Begin.\\" I think Band of Horses has really found THEIR sound, which I think for bands these days, its hard to do, and even harder to be good at it. I think \\"Infinite Arms\\" shows their growth, but also their consistency to put out a great sounding album, with a much more confident sound. The lyrics and vocals are really spectacular, in a Band of Horses way. That's not a bad thing, either. This is a must-have album if you are a Band of Horses fan, or if you are interested in listening to some of their music. Great music, great lyrics, and great album all together.
B000V63CSU|4.0|It's an odd collection of peculiar songs. Some of them you've heard of before - others probably never. Look for the hidden track by one, Charles Manson...
B003EW4KB6|5.0|I owned the original vinyl, CD and now the SACD version.      The SACD version is very concise and clean with excellent detail and sound range.    Since I own many other SACD's I would comment that Who's Next SACD fits into the category of a very good sounding musical representation of this classic album.
B001992NW4|5.0|I'm not going to review the film.  We all now it's the paragon of horror cinema.  I simply want to tell that I didn't know that an enhancement of picture and sound quality can actually increase the scare factor of a movie.  That's exactly what I experienced with this BD release of THE EXORCIST.  The first thing I watched when receiving it was the documentary 'Raising Hell: Filming The Exorcist'.  The interesting never before seen on-set filming footage (the quality of which is, understandably, at times below standard) is interspersed with Hi-Def shots of the film itself.  Seeing these brief high quality flashes made it feel as though I was really there, witnessing an actual event, registering reality, a truly unsettling experience.  This BD release of THE EXORCIST is indeed, as stated, `a must-own for any Hi-Def collector', containing both versions (I personally think the original theatrical version is still the best), with a whole range of interesting extras and comments.  This is what any high quality horror film fan deserves.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is truly one of my favorite movies. I loved how another reviewer here wrote that \\"Persuasion\\" is one of Austen's most \\"quiet\\" works, the film is a very subtle film full of nuanced grace  The actors are top notch. Amanda Root is superb. And I shall forever picture the late (amazing) Corin Redgrave as Anne Elliot's dandy and ridiculous Father.  The scenery and cinematography is picture perfect.  For the true romantics this is a must see. Marvelous BBC/Masterpiece work!!!
0316069485|3.0|I was so excited and couldn't wait for this book to be released. I am a Michael Connelly fan and have read all of his books and some more than one. Having said that, I feel like this book missed the mark. There were so many ways to make this book better. The ending left me confused and even more disappointed. I can only hope that Connelly is planning on writing a sequel to answer the many questions that I had. Just okay for me.

You have the most gifted singers singing David Foster's compositions with David Foster in the piano backed up by a full orchestra.      I got the blu-ray in my home theater with the DTS-HD soundtrack and the music just pops out of all the speakers!!!     Oh man, what great music!!!  I'll probably be watching this a hundred times before I get tired of this!    And this will be my demo concert for my sound system.
0393327655|4.0|In terms of the recent 'pop' atheists, Harris certainly ranks as the most serious thinker (Dawkins lacks any in-depth understanding of what he criticizes, while Hitchens refuses to even cite sources for his caricatures). As a sympathizer, I still burn out on the same old tired, 'religion is bad, atheism is good' rants, yet this book steers clear of those kinds of juvenile statements. Instead, it offers a constructive account of how what people believe does affect our world in a very real way. So much so, that it is crucial to understand why people believe the things they believe and why, in some cases, we need to present counter-arguments. If nothing else, those on the religious side of things needs to take this book seriously and address it on its own terms.

0385738757|5.0|I enjoyed the first book, but felt that it was a little poorly written. Still, I was excited to see what would happen next in the Scorch Trials. James Dashner didn't disappoint. I couldn't put this book down-I was glued! Definitely a good read. It kept me wondering what was coming next, highly entertaining and I couldn't get enough of the suspense. I absolutely loved The Scorch Trials and cannot wait for the third book!

B000006O7C|5.0|Jeff Buckley was a one-of-a-kind artist.      The first disc is practically an album and just amazing.  The highlights of disc 2 are: Haven't You Heard, I Know We Could Be So Happy, Back In NYC (Genesis cover), Jewel Box, and of course a live rendition of Satisfied Mind.    Beautiful stuff.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|The TrueBlood series can be a fun show at times. The actors are all absolutely fantastic, each fitting into their character like a glove. Sookie's character, however, is a bit annoying (unlike the book), and I often find myself wondering why she's being such a b***h. Tara is great, funny, and powerful. But her romance with Sam is just plain painful to watch. I don't care about mixed-racial relationships (good for them), but this one has no chemistry at all. Bill is great, cool but practical, fierce but controlled. My absolute favorite character to watch is Jason, Sookie's brother. What a fantastic role to play, so much depth and emotion. Good job to all.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|I've been a fan of John Lithgow since way back... think Harry and the Hendersons and 3rd Rock from the Sun. But to see him in this very creepy role was... well, it was creepy! Definitely he pulled it off. That said, I'm glad that he won't be coming back. It was hard to watch some of the scenes when he was at his most disturbing.
1840220554|4.0|I love Pride and Prejudice, so I thought I'd try out Jane Austen's other novels. I started with Mansfield Park. It was very difficult to get through. I gave up halfway. I may return to it if the mood hits me.

If you want happiness in your life and good things to follow you, read this book. Even after reading it, I still refer to it often, especially if I am having a bad day or a challenge in my life.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|A judgmental woman divorces her alcoholic husband and turns to a \\"self-made\\" uptight man for solace.  The love story thickens when a charming newspaper gossip columnist gets invited to the wedding and Tracy Lord ends up with three men loving her.  Which one will she ultimately choose and how does she really want to live her life?  The story is charming but pales compared to the charm of the movie's stars, Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stuart.  Their performances are top notch and so wonderful.  That is what the movie is really about is how such charming movie stars and actors can perform and play as an ensemble.  Wonderful movie and one of the greatest Hollywood films.
B003EYVXUK|4.0|It must be an interesting experience: You have top billing in a Hollywood movie but you are too young to see it.  This film is rated R for good reasons.  The lead characters are very well-cast.       Stories about vampire children may be few.  We have Anne Rice's Claudia and S.P. Somtow's Timmy Valentine.  Eli (or Abby) is welcome.    For those who have read the book and know the vampire's secret, the Swedish film hints at it but the Hollywood remake does not go near it.  Fans of the original can be reassured.  This remake carves its own path, yet the reason it succeeds is that the story it tells, so close the novel, is still a good story.      In an interview, it was revealed that they filmed Abby's back-story, and it might be on the DVD.  It's not nearly as horrific as the novel.      It is true that Hollywood remakes of successful foreign films have a poor record.  It is not generally known but the John Houston film \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" was a remake of a version of the story of only a few years earlier.  I saw it on PBS once.  But we remember only the Houston version.  I do not know if \\"Let Me In\\" will surpass the original in time, perhaps not, but it stands on its own success.      I almost prefer this version.  I have to think about it, but I think the acting is better and cinematography was more powerful.  I like the subtle changes to the characterizations.  The boy may be in love with the girl, but he has not yet faced her wrath if she does not have her proper diet.  This vampire breaks the recent trend in beautiful, sexy, angst-driven creatures.  I like Michael Giacchino's musical score and have purchased several tracks.  The composer mixes the right amounts of sweetness and dread that make the thematic motif haunting and compelling.  The non-sequitur denouement at the pool is striking.  The resolution on the train is just as ambiguous as the original but more bittersweet.        Could it have been \\"stronger\\" in some parts if I imagine myself as the filmmaker?  Yes.  But some scene compositions take your breath away.     See this film, buy the soundtrack, and buy the DVD.  And, read the novel, also.
B001LF347E|5.0|This is a great series for young or for old! If you like science fiction, fantasy and King Arthur, this is for you. Missed this series on regular tv but found it on the SyFy channel, made by the BBC and available on Amazon for a great price! It's fun and the story line is well done. Bought this for myself, gave it to my 11 year old twin granddaughters who fell in love with it, and re-bought for myself! Can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD and anxiously awaiting Season 3 on SyFy.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Earth's energy needs are met with the mining of the moon.  The process is so mechanized, only a single person is needed to operate the mining station.  Sam Bell, played by Sam Rockwell, is two weeks away from the end of his three year contract staffing the station, and he can't wait for it to end.  \\"Three years is a long time,\\" he confesses in a message to his handlers on Earth.<br /><br />Sam's only companion is GERTY, an AI presence on the station transported around by overhead railings.  GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) also stands in as a cook, a hairdresser, and a medic.  To give Sam a \\"sense\\" of GERTY's mood, GERTY flashes a \\"happy face,\\" \\"frowny face,\\" or something in between on a little screen.<br /><br />Sam knows he is tired.  When he begins to see things on the station, he recognizes his mental exhaustion.  And when one illusion causes him to wreak his \\"lunar tow truck,\\" the story gets very complicated.  He is rescued.  But... there is only him and station-based GERTY.  So who is his rescuer?<br /><br />Sam Rockwell's appearance and actions throughout mimic a person who lives in isolation.  He talks to his plants, is consumed by his hobbies, and yet demonstrates great competence at his job.  Sam wears a worn and dirty pressure suit, shaves when he feels like it, and is happy to have GERTY do the \\"housework.\\"<br /><br />After things begin to happen, Sam Rockwell, the actor, does a tremendous job staying in character for the rest of the movie.  I can't picture, for example, Harrison Ford or John Travolta starring in Moon.<br /><br />I've watched this film twice, once on the big screen and again as a DVD.  It's great both ways.  Highly recommended.
B002C949KE|4.0|Dan Ariely, in Predictably Irrational, began an early section with the following header: \\"Why Everything is Relative - Even When It Shouldn't Be.\\"   I immediately fell in love.  Ariely provides such obvious, yet confounding examples of how we so often defy logic.  One may question whether or not humanity truly does have the capacity for reason.  As one who routinely contemplates the logic, of lack thereof, in decision making, I had a voracious appetite for this book.    Ariely provides head-smacking examples of how people display in everyday life such concepts as loss aversion, the decoy effect, arbitrary coherence, behavioral herding, and the concept of zero.  We are sometimes so arbitrary in our decision making, even when it seems logical, that one wonders whether anyone truly knows the \\"correct answer\\" anymore.  Why will people take virtually anything for free; but will not pay even one penny for same item(s)?  Why do people buy products that they normally would not buy just because they seem like a \\"good deal\\" relative to a competing item?  Why do people order meals they normally would enjoy less than alternatives.      Unfortunately, Ariely does not answer those questions scientifically. But, he provides excellent contexts that those conditions - and many other irrational choices - do exist.    Ariely, like most \\"behavioral economists,\\" seem maddeningly intent on disproving the classical economic theorems of supply and demand and adherence to the \\"rational man.\\"  Behavioral economics, and its close cousins like cognitive and social psychology, are fascinating supplements to their respective fields.  But, I find that behavioral economics explains and enhances classical economics rather than displaces it.  Predictably Irrational focuses more on the anecdotes than the theories - assuming they exist - behind behavioral economics.  So, one cannot consider this book a comprehensive guide to the field.  Rather, this book follows in the Freakonomics genre of introducing an esoteric field of study to mass consumption.  It is a bit light on statistical analysis; but heavy on stuff that will help normal people think about concepts they do not normally consider.    This book is excellent for marketing gurus or anyone else who ever has to \\"sell\\" a product or an idea.  Or, the book is also useful for anyone who is just interested in learning \\"what makes people tick.\\"  The book is eye-opening for individuals like me who sometimes are genuinely confounded by others seeming lack of rationality. Rational beings will not accept the irrational choices that we make.  But, Predictably Irrational helps to understand and acknowledge those decisions.  Hopefully, we can learn and improve on our irrationality rather than merely accept that we are hopelessly irrational.

Can't wait to read (or listen to) the rest of his work!  Thanks!

0553805371|4.0|In era of paperbacks and e-books, I had forgotten what a joy it was to pick up a hardcover book printed on heavy high quality paper, with illustrations that are clearly not after thoughts, in a typeface that is pleasing to the eye and easy to read. The book is beautiful, as are the ideas. As a well educated, intelligent reader, I had high hopes for this book. Alas, unlike many reviewers who appear conversant with Penrose, quantum mechanics, and all manner of esoterica, I found it rough going at times.<br /><br />This is not \\"Physics for the Great Unwashed\\" by any means...critics who found this oversimplified should be sent Mensa cards immediately. The authors were obviously aiming for a somewhat sophisticated general reader...those who were not math majors, but are comfortable with some degree of complexity, and have some general knowledge of post-Einsteinian physics. That said, this is far from an easy read.<br /><br />In bypassing complex mathmatical explanations, the authors obviously aim for a broader audience than the academic community, and succeed on some levels. Many reviewers seem critical of the approach, pointing out that by simplifying the authors skip over some important philosophical, scientific, and theological debates by offering a \\"lets pick one and move on\\" approach. The early sections of the book, which summarize the evolution of scientific and philosophical thought that lead to relativity, quantum theory, et al, is well done for me as a layman. I was familiar with the lay of the land, but the authors do a nice job of bringing us along to the present day with the background needed to understand the more esoteric quantum information.<br /><br />The proposed theory that all possible universes (and times) exist at once seems to me to be another spin (I take my puns where I can find them) on the \\"holographic universe\\" popularized by Talbot, Gribbin and others. I can't pretend to fully understand the central section of the book, dealing with wave particle duality and interference patterns, etc. Although the wave-particle duality seems easy enough, some of the wave mechanics are beyond casual reading and I haven't the passion to hunker down for a few days to dissect the explanations.<br />I suggest the reader simply accept that some of this will be over our heads, and move along. The final chapters are quite interesting.<br /><br />There seems to be quite a dust-up over the proposed M-Theory, or Theory of Everything, which the authors offer as \\"the\\" model of reality; one in which the universe has no beginning or end, and includes all possible universes existing at the same time. Many critics seem to feel that if we preclude a beginning, we preclude a \\"Creator\\", which strikes me as a rather Newtonian view of theology. If one can accept a supernatural being who created the universe, doesn't it follow that this Diety may fit quite comfortably into this new paradigm if we cease to think in a linear fashion of beginning, middle, and end? I've never thought of God as living on a linear timeline. Perhaps the Biblical account of Creation was a local event in a much larger (and eternal) scheme of things.<br /><br />I think the popular press, being at a loss of how to deal with Hawking in a sound bite, have seized upon God as a surefire attention getter. In passing beyond Newtonian physics, perhaps it's time we allowed for a more complex view of theology and of God. To me, Hawkings' new theory may finally bridge the gap between religion and science.ference patterns, etc. Although the wave-particle duality seems easy enough, some of the wave mechanics are beyond casual reading and I haven't the passion to hunker down for a few days to dissect the explanations.

0312600844|4.0|When Patty, a college basketball star, marries Walter, a young lawyer hooked on the environment, she gives her all to the marriage and her two kids, Joey and Jessica. As a stay-at-home mom she can't do enough for her St. Paul neighbors and is lauded for her kindness and warmth. But kids grow up and life changes. Teen-age Joey starts an affair with the girl next door Patty dislikes and eventually moves in with her family, much to Patty's distress. Then to everyone's surprise Walter takes a job with a mining conglomerate, ostensibly to save a songbird, and the Berglunds move to Washington, D. C. There they run into rocker Richard Katz again, Walter's one-time college roommate who loves them both, and in turn is loved by both of them. By middle-age Patty is increasingly angry and confused and, perhaps in self-defense, Walter is more and more drawn to his young assistant. If all this seems rather hopeless Franzen seems to be saying that life itself is no picnic and all we can do is labor on and make the best of it.  This is a very long book that I found terribly gloomy at times, yet it's also funny and honest, and I kept turning the pages. Does it shed much light on today's conflicted world? Not exactly, but it's a good try.

B000002GBB|5.0|Though \\"The Grand Illusion\\" is a fantastic album, there is no doubt in my mind that \\"Pieces of Eight\\" is their best album.  Every single song on this album is great.  This album represents Styx at their rocking best.  It is difficult to pick out a favourite on this album, it's that good.  Thirty plus years after its release, I continue to listen to this album on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, this would be the last great Styx album.  Though there were moments on the albums that followed, Styx would never recreate the magic that they did on \\"Pieces of Eight\\".  The 70's was a great time for rock music and Styx was a big part of it.

B002VECM6S|1.0|This movie is so very bland. I really wanted to like it.    Almost immediately, felt like I was watching a TV movie on the Hallmark Channel, some overly sappy, \\"christian-friendly\\", family movie. And don't get me wrong, there should be good, decent family movies out there, however, this was so not deserving of all the buzz and certainly not of Sandra winning the Oscar. Her character, Leigh Ann had no change. Zero. None. She was the same from the beginning, middle to end. Leigh Ann never changed, despite even her line professing that \\"... he changed me.\\" Not true. What ever happened to a character arc?    Everyone was too perfect. No one had any flaws. Her family was picture perfect, the husband, son and sister... even Micheal despite coming from a rough background (which was still candy-coated). Oh and by the way, lets save Michael, but leave the brother to fend for himself. Nice.    Leigh Ann brings Michael home and the family is just hunky-dory with everything???? C'mon, the kids wouldn't be a little put out by this, especially maybe Collins, the teenage daughter - now suddenly living with some strange, big, intimidating black dude??? And the husband wouldn't have any concerns... nothing at all?!?!?    How bout that car accident --- boy, I wish I could get off scott-free like Michael did. Must be nice.    And then near the end, I love how because the movie really had no \\"villian\\" (that's a major omission), they now make the NCAA the villian. Lets now investigate why Michael (maybe b/c he's African American) chose the school because, geez, he must be the ONLY KID to ever follow in the footsteps of a family's tradition to go to the same school. WOW, that's weak. But I guess it happened. It just should've been written a lot better!    If I were an African American, I'd actually be very offended by how the movie portrayed and dealt with the race card. I understand it's the South, but c'mon, the movie completely made the white people the heroes and really patronized the poor, ghetto black folks. Ouch.    This film was clearly made for people who want an underdog type story but who don't really want to see the truth in what it takes to follow through with a conviction. And I do applaud the real life Tuohy family for doing what so many people wouldn't do, but this sappy, bland, underperformed, underscripted movie is horrible.    I'm sure the true life events may have been a little tougher, a little more challenging, a little more controversial thus making the outcome that much more emotionally charged and inspiring, but the movie lacked in all those areas and just re-enacted a very safe and boring version of only the pretty, funny moments.

B001CWOCUO|3.0|I like Rihanna, and I read reviews of this Live DVD, to give me an idea about purchasing.  But Madonna is, and always will be, the queen of pop.  Rihanna has a long ways to go before she is a queen of anything.  I'm surprised to read she does not sing some of her favorite songs, when unlike Madonna who has over 10 albums, who can get away with leaving out big hits because she has so many, Rihanna is not there yet, with just a couple albums so far.  I'd also rather hear a hip/hop beat, rather than rock guitar.  I probably won't buy this after what I read.  To hear she doesn't really dance, unlike Madonna or Janet or Beyonce, is a disappointment too.  All that said, I really like her new song, 'Only Girl', better than anything off her last album, besides 'Rude Boy', which apparently isn't in concert either.  With more time, maybe she can be a princess, but Beyonce and the up & comer Gaga, already claim that title.    All of Madonna's concerts are genius.  If you've never seen her live or bought a DVD, I suggest the Confessions Tour to start.  My next purchase will be Sticky and Sweet Tour on Blu-Ray.
0547258305|5.0|This book stars a strong but lonely heroine in a medieval fantasy setting.  People known as \\"Gracelings\\" possess mismatched eyes and an unusual skill or \\"grace\\" of near supernatural ability.  One might have a grace for baking, or horsemanship, or sewing.  Or, in Katsa's case, a killing grace.  It's hard for Katsa to make friends when everyone around her fears her.  Even without training, she has an eerie knack with any weapon, perfect balance and incredible luck.  Katsa's abilities as a warrior have been put to use by her uncle King Randa, who forces her to use her deadly skill against his enemies. Sick with shame over the way her uncle has forced her to torture his opponents she starts an underground rebel group.<br /><br />Katsa reminded me tremendously of Katniss from The Hunger Games Chronicles (and not just because their names both start with \\"K\\")  They are both expert hunters, extremely resourceful outdoorswomen, incredible survivors, and both are trying to escape from an uncomfortable political regime.  They both detest the idea of ever getting married and seem to be natural loners.  They are both stubborn and hardheaded.<br /><br />Things start to get interesting when the neighboring kingdom's heir, Po, arrives.  His grace in sword-fighting means that he's the closest to an equal that Katsa has ever met.  Katsa is very slow to realize that she has feelings for Po, and resists their connection, not wanting to be \\"tied down.\\"  Together they unravel the mystery of who has kidnapped one of the kings of the seven kingdoms and face against their enemy, King Leck, a sadistic tyrant who has the terrifying power to influence people's thoughts according to his own mad whims.<br /><br />Somehow I didn't mind that despite how caring and warm Po is, Katsa never does change her mind about marriage or children.  Their relationship continues, but Katsa always keeps him at an arm's length.  I was heartbroken when Po revealed the truth about his Grace... he was never a fighter, at all.  Rather, his ability to read minds allowed him to anticipate his opponents moves.  When he loses his sight, he is able to use his mental ability to navigate his surroundings.  Fans of the Alanna series by Tamara Pierce will enjoy the mix of magic, action-adventure and romance that Graceling offers.ability to read minds allowed him to anticipate his opponents moves.

B000W91RUG|5.0|This is a brilliantly acted ensemble sitcom!  The characters get more defined and more unforgettable with every episode.  Be careful -- this is one of those addictive series-- you won't be able to stop with just one!<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy the quirky comedy of the year!
B000002IST|5.0|I love this album, and it's one of my all-time favorites (overall, not only from Genesis).  Yes, it has some songs that I don't care much about (like \\"Hold on My Heart\\"), and yes, it is not exactly like previous Genesis albums.  Yawn.  I wonder about those die-hard fans that complain when comparing to previous recordings - after reading a masterpiece like the Bible do you refuse to read anything else of lesser quality?...  I love WCD's rich and meticulous production and sound engineering.  Even the less attractive songs enjoy this quality and provide great listening experience.  And then, when great production meets some very good song, very good instrumental work and good vocals - this is why I like music.  \\"I Can't Dance\\", \\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\", and then - shining from above - \\"Driving the Last Spike\\" and the amazing \\"Fading Lights.\\"  If your thinking is so narrow that the fact that this is a different Genesis than previous works is bothering you, then buy this album and put a sticker with some other name on top of the \\"Genesis\\" name.  And while there you can do the same with The Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\".
0307387178|5.0|Into The Wild  By Jon Krakauer  The story of Christopher Johnson McCandless is truly inspiring, yet terrifying at the same time.  Jon Krakauer does a great job in making the reader feel like he/she is actually living Christopher's eccentric adventure.  You can feel the beauty of the amazing sights Christopher experienced, as well as the fear and the hunger.  My favorite part of this book was when Christopher finds the abandoned bus in the Alaska interior and lives in the wilderness for four months.  It is truly amazing how Christopher McCandles could touch the hearts of so many individuals in such a short amount of time.  Although some may say Christopher McCandless is a crazy idiot, all readers including me, can relate to Chris because you realize that Chris was just a normal human being, just like us.  Into The Wild is in many ways a mystery.  The big question \\"Why did he do it?\\" will keep you thinking, even when you are not reading the book.  Jon Krakauer does a great job in re-telling Christopher's story, but I feel that some chapters such as chapters 8 and 9 should be majorly shortened because of their irrelevance.  I highly recommend this book, and then watch the movie.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|There are wonderful reviews of this film and all well-deserved. I wanted to comment on the blu-ray transfer; it is fantastic and a great reflection of the film, through color, feel, lighting and contrast...blu-ray captures it all!  Bravo!
B004132I4S|5.0|I would like to put this simply and state that I just recently saw him in concert, and it changed everything. I was very skeptical about this album and missed his bajo and guitar melodies, but I promise you if you truly take time to listen to the album and experience it in a musically provocative environment, it will blow you away. Read a little about it. It's about the artist Royal Robertson who was a schizophrenic, and the music relates to his art and life. Watch an interview or read an article where Sufjan explains his take on what you need to keep in mind when you listen to it. When Sufjan set aside time in his concert to explain to the audience what the album meant to him, it gave me entirely new perspective on the way I perceived the album. The metallic, deranged noises add to the mystique of the subject, and it creates an ethereal mood that honestly engulfs you whole. The casual Sufjan fan may never understand, but if you truly love Sufjan Stevens as I do, you will allow this album to amaze you every time you press play.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|I'm feeling very honored to be the one who can write the review Nr.100 about this great record. And it's realy great! I like Scary Monsters the same way like 20 years before. It's so wild and strange and funky!!! In my opinion it's Bowies best album along with Low.     If you don't have this cd already, simply buy it!    Greetings from Hamburg (Germany)
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe is an excellent player and this is, to date, his best video yet.    In some of his earlier videos the camera shots jumped around way too much. This one has a little of that but not quite as bad. It is frustrating to hear him play a smokin lead while the camera is fixed on somebody else shaking a tamborine.    It's an excellent performance on Joe's part but a so-so performance on the part of the video production manager. Still well worth the money.
B000000W5P|5.0|This is a classic Stones album from 1978 and it could have been even better if some of the unreleased songs recorded at the time had been put on the album. As for the actual album though the songs \\"Miss You\\", \\"Shattered\\", and \\"Beast Of Burden\\" are all well known classics. The only song I could do without is their version of \\"Just My Imagination\\". It isn't bad, but I usually just don't listen to it. I love when The Stones do a little country at times and \\"Far Away Eyes\\" is one of my favorites on here. As for some of the unreleased songs from these sessions \\"No Spare Parts\\" and \\"Claudine\\" are both great. You can hear both of them on Youtube.  The thing about The Stones is just their bootlegged and unreleased songs  are better than about every other bands greatest hits.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen.  Amazing follow-up and satisfying conclusion to the too-short TV show Firefly.
B000JMLFLW|2.0|I love my Kindle, but was hopeing to read a famous classic without any editing, meaning reduction, of the text.  This edition is so poorly edited as to be confusing at some points, when, for instance, suddenly we are reading about a previously unintroduced Miss King, who is mentioned and then forgotten.  There are no descriptions of clothing, very little of scenery, none really of homes/estates.  The book consists of conversations, which are terrific due to the author's skill, and the bridges that get us to those.  How can I get an unedited, unabridged copy of the book?  That should be made clear when we order these \\"free\\" books: they are vastly edited.  If that's not what you want, don't get these.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I ordered this cd because Zac Brown is one of my favorite bands. When I first played it I wasn't sure it was as good as their first cd. But as I listened to it, it has grown on me. It's a great cd. And Amazon did a great job getting it to me quickly. I pre-ordered this cd, and I received it a couple of days after the release date. Thanks for a A+ cd!
1932100660|1.0|Although this book is about much more than heart disease, heart disease is one of the \\"western diseases\\" that diet seems to be related to and which is central to this book, and for which The China Study purports to offer a solution. Solving the riddle of something like atherosclerosis is of great personal interest to me, since despite very few traditional \\"risk factors\\", I have had three heart attacks.  Theories abound, often conflicting, generally involving some aspect of our modern diet. For example, the lack of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) in typical modern diets compared to primate diets.  Kathryn Milton PhD found that wild primates consume the human equivalent of 6 grams of Vitamin C a day as well as huge amounts of other micronutrients - lending credence to those like Dr. Linus Pauling that atherosclerosis is sub-clinical scurvy of the arteries - a hypothesis based on ascorbate's wide role in preserving our connective tissues from damage.  Somewhat similarly, Dr. Joel Furhman, who actually admires Campbell and tends toward veganism himself, credits his good clinical results in reversing disease with a very nutrient dense plant based diet. Then there are those who think fat is to blame, or a particular kind of fat (\\"bad fats\\" - usually animal - although Pritiken and Dr. Esselstyne wouldn't let you eat an olive or a nut. (This despite evidence showing healthy societies (eg Polynesians before McDonalds) which have always eaten lots of coconut (saturated fat!).  Dr. Campbell advocates a vegan diet and his main conclusion is that people who eat the most animal food get the most chronic disease.  But is it true?  Since apes eat a lot of wild plants and only about 10 percent animal based food, this seems evolutionarily reasonable, and clinicians like Dr. Fuhrman do report what seem like amazing results from a diet which tries to mimic what primates eat, although even Fuhrman admits and is currently advocating for large scale scientific studies to back up his clinical experiences.  But that doesn't answer the question -  what, in the diet is actually causing the deposition of arterial plaque, or the development of cancers? Is it something you ate, or something you DIDN'T eat (like enough nutrient dense and vitamin C rich foods).  Are all animal foods to blame?  Are other factors involved (environmental toxins, contaminated \\"feed lot\\" animal products instead of wild game, inflammation in the body, genetics, etc)?  Or is a whole foods, nutrient rich diet including modest amounts of uncontaminated meat or fish (preferable of a wild origin) just as good?  These questions will ultimately only be answered by rigorous analysis of the evidence, and one object of the original China Study on which Campbell's book is based was to collect data from the many counties of China regarding dietary and other habits which might influence disease, as well the incidence of disease.  The correlations can then form the basis for hypotheses about what might be responsible for the diseases, although those correlations in themselves don't prove anything.  Unfortunately, Dr. Campbell does no one a service by drawing rigid and poorly supported conclusions from that data (and other data) which often, incidentally, contradict what he says.  If you want to read a serious, long but very interesting critique of his methodology and analysis by someone who actually crunched the numbers in the original China Study and discovered Dr. Campbell had either badly misinterpreted or somehow overlooked much of the data, you can google Denise Menger China Study or go to rawfoodsos  D O T c o m .  Ms Menger is a one time vegetarian, doesn't consume dairy because of food intolerances, and isn't paid by the meat or dairy industry.  She does have a strong willed quest to get at the truth though, and she finds some amazing stuff about the correlations in the China Study.  For example, the counties with highest animal protein intakes actually had substantially far less incidence ofheart attack than the almost vegan counties.  She notes that Campbell also omits much data simply because it doesn't fit his apparently pre-conceived notions.  You might also compare Dr. Campbell's conclusions with those of Staffan Lindeberg MD in his recently translated \\"Food and Western Disease\\".  Dr. Lindeberg and his team from Lund University in Sweden studied another population with extremely low rates of western diseases (atherosclerosis, diabetes, arthritis, cancers etc), in his case the people of the Trobriand Islands, and found they consumed a \\"paleo\\" diet, which included fair amounts of animal foods.  Or look into the Okinawa Study about a population which also has had the best longevity and a pronounced absence of western disease.  It concludes meat and fish should be limited, but not excluded.  So before swallowing all of Dr. Campbell's recommendations, I suggest looking at the critique by Menger and other studies and analyses like those of Dr. Lindeberg which show that our diets can be much more varied than Campbell would suggest.heart attack than the almost vegan counties.

B001FB5634|1.0|This is the most depressing movie I have ever watched. 5 minutes into it I felt like I wanted to kill myself and from there on it only got worse. What is the point of making such a movie? Why did I keep watching it to the end? Like there isn't enough to be depressed about anyway? I'm very fragile, family members always hide away the knives in the house from me and I still have nightmares a week later. There are ratings about every kind of content. There should be some Triple-Prozac rating for a movie like this to warn the public about its dangerously depressing effect. Ugh, Ugh, UGHGHGHGH...  Update - August 2015 - I still have nightmares from this movie (the scene with the people locked in the basement with amputated limbs); I tried to kill myself 3 times because of this movie, was hospitalized twice and received electroshock therapy. I lost my job, my wife left me, my kids shun me and I can't get it up at all. I'm suing.
B0036TGSR6|1.0|The overall plot was very engaging and interesting.  I liked the concept.  Acting was good and it was well shot and suspenseful.  But several of the key parts of the plot don't make sense at all!!  Seriously, it ruined the movie for me.  It was very careless writing.<br /><br />Ok, MAJOR SPOILER ALERT.  Don't read on unless you want to know.<br /><br />To start with, Ewan's character would have to be a complete idiot to tell them he knew at the party.  Why?  Why would he do that?  There is no reason at all.  This created a totally unsatisfying ending to the movie.<br /><br />And then, there is no way the GPS would lead him to the professor.  The first ghost writer was heading BACK, not there.  He would have set it to take him back to the island so it would have led Ewan back to Lange's home.  And if the first GW was returning from the professor when he was killed, that means he was just figuring it out.  He would definitely not go see the professor if he knew who he really was.  That would be suicide.  So if he was just figuring it out, how did he manage to rewrite the first sentences of every chapter in the book????  This just makes no sense at all.  And there are several more examples.  Sorry but this is horrible writing.  Very amateurish.

0385532458|5.0|I thought I had read all of John Grisham's books and came across this one while looking to see if any new titles had been published.  Found this one, ordered it and received it quickly.  Great value, another great read.  Overall, a very positive experience.
0596806027|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, HTML5 is an emerging set of standards at the frontier of the web.  Only the most well-heeled of developers want to work on such frontiers, but many people want to know what is coming and how to prepare for it.  HTML5's advantages include plugin-free support of video, some new form elements, local storage beyond cookies, geolocation, and the new canvas element that most versions of internet explorer don't support.  Someday, perhaps a decade or so in the future, these elements will be widely supported and developers won't have to write two versions of their web pages: one for html5 and one for html4.  But it will take a LONG time for all of those people still running XP or Windows 2000 or older versions of the Mac to get there.    My main interest in HTML5 arises because the iPhone and iPad don't support either flash or java.  Flash is often used for video, but that can be done via QuickTime and WindowsMedia and I've never needed flash for video.  Flash can also produce elaborate simulations or games that interact with users and are not video based.  So can Java.  But both are excluded on the iOS operating system.  The only alternative for web developers is the canvas element in HTML5.  Pilgrim gives this important element only basic coverage: He shows how to draw a static graph (including axes and labeled points).  He shows how to add images, and creates a simple mouse-driven game.  But he does not show the full code for the game -- you have to go online to access that.  This is the simplest form of interaction and Pilgrim does not cover anything more advanced.  I have no idea if the canvas is double-buffered or if we have to do that somehow in our code, for example.  Also left out is any mention of animating a canvas over time.  Most of what Pilgrim does with the canvas element could be done with static gifs: The game he implements would be EASIER using html4 with tables.    Pilgrim does present a useful discussion of different video codecs in HTML5 and the challenge of working in this developing world.  I have been using H.264 recently because I thought it was an open standard and is available on the iPhone and iPad.  However, Pilgrim makes it clear that if I ever \\"go commercial\\" with my work, I'll have to pay some serious royalties to the patent owners for the next 20 years or so.  The WebM and Theora+Ogg systems don't require any royalty payments, but neither do they work on the iPhone or iPad.  (Making advanced material available on the iOS within the web is a tremendous challenge for developers these days!)    In his discussion of the new semantic tags, Pilgrim didn't bother with even a single screenshot of the resulting web page, nor did he contrast different HTML4/HTML5 alternatives.  More detail is apparently available in the online version, but that presents its own set of challenges: The online edition is only free for 45 days.  After that, you have to buy a subscription.    The publisher for this book is O'Reilly, one of my favorite publishers of computer books.  But the cover also states \\"Google (tm) Press.\\"  I felt the ghostly fingers of Google (tm) running through the book.    I certainly like the company, but I found the emphasis and the tone to be quite favorable to my favorite search engine -- not as unbiased and objective as I felt it should be.    In summary: The coverage of new features is thin, especially with the canvas element.  Helpful illustrations are missing (though available for a short time in the online edition).  Code is missing (though available free for a short time in the online edition).  The alpine chamois on the cover should have been drawn in a more gaunt form and perhaps with a cast on a leg or two: HTML5 is not up and running, it is thin and limping.
B003YOZNBU|2.0|I thought this would be a great movie from the previews, but once again all the good parts were the previews. I bought this movie instead of renting it first. Waste of $15! Megan is a hottie but she dont even show skin. Plus the movie is pretty short with a punch line my 4 yr old figured out.
B003L20IJM|5.0|How pleasant to see a movie without sex or violence. The movie is for kids, but can be enjoyed by adults. There are too few movies these days that do not contain bad language, sexual overtones or just plain violent action. They may sell well, but I prefer this type of movie that is clean fun.    The message for kids is usually something about being resposible.     I will purchase it for my own. It is a great show for grandkids as well.
0838577016|5.0|One of the best neuroscience reference books I've come across. Clearly written and easy to understand. A great book for anyone interested in the field.
0553293397|5.0|A lot of people don't realize that as famous as Isaac Asimov was as a science fiction writer, he took great pride in writing mysteries, often of short story length. He has several volumes of fascinating short story mysteries.<br /><br />Here, we get a full length mystery, once again staffed by the interesting and entertaining investigative duo of Elijah Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw, his humaniform robot partner. This time, the murder occurs away from Earth on a \\"Spacer world\\". This particular Spacer world is extreme in that the residents have a phobia for human contact, which provides an odd sort of balance for Bailey's phobia of the great outdoors. The murder is a classic locked door mystery, and the solution is impossible on its face.<br /><br />Since Elijah had so recently solved a Spacer's murder on Earth, and since there are no such investigative skills in a society where murder is unheard of, the Spacers request Elijah as the man to solve this one. Asimov provides us with an interesting look at a society that has gone in completely the opposite direction of his over-crowded Earth cities ... a world where robots do virtually everything for the human residents, while on Earth any robots outside of routine automation are looked upon with threat and suspicion.<br /><br />Asimov took great pride in the internal logic of his mysteries, and this is a good example. \\"The Naked Sun\\" is an entertaining read for fans of both science fiction and mysteries. Although it is not absolutely necessary, I would recommend that you have read \\"The Caves of Steel\\" before tackling this book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've read reviewers saying if you have a low IQ or are a redneck, this is for you... hmm, my wife and I both have healthy IQ's, and we both enjoyed it. I found Firefly to be wickedly entertaining.  I do like the quirky stuff - Northern Exposure, early X-Files, West Wing, Battlestar Galactica - so I'm not going to insult the folks that don't like it, I'll just disagree.  Yeah sure, it's not 'realistic' even given the setting, but name me a show worth much that's totally realistic...  I found the characters to be interesting and fun, and I enjoyed the mysteries and the odd-ball sense of humour.
1423113381|4.0|If just from the book story itself, I'll rate 3 star at most ... but fortuantely, I listen the audio book which Katherine Kellgren's British accents for Sadie just make it very funny and exciting.

B00337KM2S|5.0|In a wrecked economy at least one industry seems to be thriving:  the sacking folks industry.  In this interesting field of endeavor we find spineless, litigious-leery employers turning to third-party entities to perform the firings for them.  Thus we have the bizarre premise of an excellent film, UP IN THE AIR, the adventures of corporate head chopper Ryan Bingham (an aloof George Clooney) as he travels the U.S., suavely and swiftly terminating workers--all while rapidly approaching the coveted Ten Million Mile Membership.  Accordingly, Ryan is barely home 40 nights a year. . .until his superior (Jason Bateman is priceless) calls him back to corporate headquarters, as the technology is now in place to fire via streaming live video.  Alas, Ryan is grounded.<br /><br />Or so we thought.  The inspiration for the web cam terminations, young, gung-ho Natalie (Anna Kendrick), needs valuable experience in the field, so Ryan takes her under his wing and off they go to the airport, where Ryan tutors his protege on the fine art of streamlining travel.  And as they go, from city to city, Ryan hooks up with his female alter ego, Alex (a sizzling Vera Farmiga), while Natalie discovers she's just not cut out for the stark brutality of shattering a human being's life.  These interactions of the various characters furnish the charm of this film; they're not only infinitely interesting--they're very, very believable.  There are several termination scenes, some of them humorous, some of them disturbing, all of them compelling.<br /><br />Yet the beauty of UP IN THE AIR is its delicious irony.  Ryan, so proud of his fierce independence and reliance on nothing but a departure board, finds himself falling in love.  Yet the emptiness of his life resonates when Alex can't return the love (she has a family of her own); thus Ryan, on the side a motivational speaker, no longer believes the nonsense he preaches (jettison all the burdens of your life); he realizes he's trapped in the life he so meticulously created.  (As the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for.)  Accordingly there is an element of angst as UP IN THE AIR concludes, yet aren't there aspects of life much the same?  Besides, Clooney, Farmiga, Bateman, Kendrick, and the rest of a very diverse, ensemble cast make for some very spirited movie watching.  Wrecked economy or no.<br />--D.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|The packaging is well crafted (read: tasteful) and the image quality is fantastic.

B001NLKT60|2.0|I enjoyed the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo... it didn't blow me away, I think most people guessed what was coming, but it at least kept me interested.  The sequel, however, did not keep me interested at all.  I am the type of person that will always finish a book or movie, even if I don't like it, but I was really struggling to care about this novel.  The story never really draws you in, it just drags on, and eventually becomes very tiresome.  I stuck with it hoping it would redeem itself with a stunning conclusion, but no, the story lumbers on just as you would expect.  By the time the \\"twist\\" comes, you are less than impressed (assuming you hadn't already guessed what was coming) and then things just sort of end.  I feel like it wants to be a cliffhanger but really I don't think there is any doubt what will happen at the beginning of the third novel.  I usually enjoy series and have trouble letting go of characters but I will not continue reading this series.

0312600844|2.0|I read and enjoyed the Corrections.  I was looking forward to reading Freedom when it came out.  I enjoyed the first two hundred pages.  I liked the beginning of the narrative where I wasn't quite sure whose point of view was going to become the most prominent.  I enjoyed Patty's autobiography chapters because it finally gave me a main character point of view and, even though I didn't really care for Patty, I at least started to develop some sympathy for her character.  When the book switched over to Richard's point of view, it all went down hill.  The turning point when I just couldn't take it any more was the beyond boring conversation about Walter's work saving birds and promoting strip mining.  It was excruciating.  When Lalitha entered the picture, the characters became more unbelievable and that's where I lost my patience.  I did what I never do - I skipped to the end.  I have a strong ability to power through some boring reading, but I was just out.  There were no characters I liked, the story wasn't engaging, and I didn't look forward each night to reading it.  Just because Oprah likes it, and frankly I really can't understand why she would, doesn't make it good.  I think people should hold off annointing Franzen the new JD Salinger or Hemingway.  This may not be the most elegant way to say it, but this book really sucked.
0375836675|4.0|Spoiler warning.<br /><br />This book has quite a lot going for it. Zusac has a John Clarke knack for Australian idiom, and the dialogue is enjoyably (if perhaps occasionally effectively exaggerated) authentic (and I should mention that I'm not just talking about Steve Irwin, `Crikey' stuff - though the \\"Strewth, mate, that's a shocker,\\" sort of thing is there - but there's plenty of swearing). The opening scene is a cracker (a genius for getting reluctant teens in if, as I happened to come across this book, you're having to try to get a bunch of year nine's to read it), both language and humour. He can often turn a nice phrase too. The book has heart: Zusac really has a go at challenging the habitual, unthinking selfishness and emptiness of complacent lifestyles. There are constant episodes to entertain throughout, but these also build to a climax to address a central mystery driving you on. There are some deft scenes and observations along the way (one that comes to mind is the comfortably distant understanding portrayed between Ed and his brother).<br /><br />But...<br /><br />...this book has a few buts too. In a way it's a shame that I came to it at the wrong age: a weakness for me is probably a strength for younger readers. Yeah, that's condescending, but I don't know that it has to be taken that way. My point is that it *is* more juvenile to see problems as strikingly clearly as they are presented here. Everyone, it seems, has some single central unresolved issue, and once that's addressed, everything is peachy. Now, sure, Zusac would be well aware that this is oversimplifying, and the novel deliberately does this so each story is, to steal an insightful term from an essay at the back of one edition, a parable. And there is truth in this: many a more layered novel (or individual) hides a simple lack of integrity behind a screen of Hamlet-like justifications, meditations, sophistications. However there is also truth in the generally older awareness that after the resolution, even the good resolution, there are a lot of days to come, and you're rarely going to solve your (or other's) problems, but perhaps can get better at dealing with the inevitability of future ones.<br /><br />Moreover I wasn't convinced by his treatment of a few things, such as violence, romance and ambition. Ed has the crap beaten out of him a couple of times, and the message is that this makes him purer and stronger - there's even some borderline pleasure in it. This feels like ludicrous romanticism to me: I suspect someone who'd been jumped, as Ed is, a couple of times would be far more likely to be traumatised and fearful. Similarly it feels like readers are just supposed to go along with the Audrey solution, but I can't see that the process here (like a couple of others of the solutions) really validates the wonderful transformation. Finally it could just be an excuse of someone merely writing unpaid reviews of someone who's sold millions of books, but there are mixed messages about what makes someone valuable. Humble taxi-driving Ed may have just made a huge difference in the lives of several people, but he still knows that if he stays in this suburb driving taxis and helping people, he's still a failure. Interesting that an Australian book can have this, \\"Make something of yourself,\\" sensibility.<br /><br />I should glance at the bit where the `author' pops into the novel. A risky technique, but it can be done well. I enjoyed, for example, Jane Austen and David Lodge popping in for a line or two in [[ASIN:1593081545 Mansfield Park]] and [[ASIN:0140057463 How Far Can You Go?]], but Zusak goes a lot further than this in making the `author' a central plot device - the solution to the mystery of just who the hell is putting Ed up to all this. I believe this ending has tended to polarise readers - I feel somewhere in the middle. I didn't find it disappointing, but I can't say I found it really satisfying either. There is a cleverness for this book,\\"I'm not the messenger. I am the message,\\" because it so clearly is targeting readers who might identify with some of these unmotivated characters to get on with it: Ed is a character, but even more he's a moral, a model. And to TELL his readers this is upping the ante on them responding rather than merely being entertained. But it isn't up there with the best of surprise finishes which,as John Regehr said in reviewing Iain Banks'excellent [[ASIN:0316030570 Use of Weapons]],<br />\\"Like all good surprise endings, it enhances the story and makes us rethink it, unlike the Hollywood-style surprise where one walks away feeling puzzled and cheated.\\"<br />I won't go as far as saying I felt `puzzled and cheated,' but the surprise ending doesn't really inform anything that's come before: you don't look back on all sorts of incidents and go, \\"Ahhh...,\\" - as you might have, say, in the 6th sense. To play the author card in one way is clever, but in another is just trying to bluff your way through a deus ex machina.sage,\\" because it so clearly is targeting readers who might identify with some of these unmotivated characters to get on with it: Ed is a character, but even more he's a moral, a model.

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I was chuckling in the theaters and even more so when I was watching the DVD. The dialogues are that funny and extremely well executed by 4 of the best actors today. The four main actors (Downey, Paltrow, Rourke, and Rockwell) are all amazing actors and the acting level of this film itself makes this film worth watching.<br /><br />I am not sure if I have heard of better banter between two members of opposite sex since Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant made the now legendary \\"Bringing up Baby\\" (1938).<br /><br />The brilliance of Robert Downey Jr is that he makes Tony Stark, without his special suit, more interesting than the Ironman. He has real flaws and tries his best to cope with life's challenges and is not always successful. He also has definite weaknesses and is forced to rely on his friends. Make no mistake, Tony Stark is not universally admired nor even liked. His relationship with the Avengers are definite love/hate as his relationship with his Pepper Potts.<br /><br />His relationship with Natalie Rushman (Black Widow) played by Scarlett Johansson, is probably funniest as he tries to deal with many facets of her chameleon qualities.  \\"How do you do it?\\", questions the astounded Tony Stark, \\"You're a triple impostor! I've never seen anything like it! Is there anything real about you?\\".<br /><br />The action sequences are also great. The final fighting sequence, however, could have been little longer and elaborate as it ended too predictably.<br /><br />I give strong kudos to the writers, the director, and the actors for executing a movie with such memorable dialogues and humor.<br /><br />I wish the 3rd Ironman would be more like the 2nd than the original. The original Ironman was good, but not this good. Too bad Rourke character can't come back for the 3rd role, but I wish the rest all come back and give us another lesson on how movie dialogues should be executed with such expert comedic timing.

As 'brand new' Hits...<br /><br />Hit songs that by themselves (in their original versions), are truly music JEWELS.<br /><br />But... Trying to make them 'new' hits when covered by performers that have musically nothing to do with the original performers, this becomes nothing than a real Bad Joke.<br /><br />I admired Phil Collins when he became the leader of Genesis after the departure of Peter Gabriel. Even most of his solo works, in my opinion are truly good music efforts.<br /><br />However...  Now, a truly Brit trying to sound as a Motown singer...<br />PATHETIC. That's it...

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is about a young boy who is taken from his home on Earth into outer space to train to fight in a war against aliens called buggers. Orson Scott Card, the author, does a great job of showing how intense the main character, Ender's, feelings are. Ender seems to hate his life throughout the book. Orson Scott Card writes so well that the reader gets depressed when Ender's depressed feelings are described. He makes the reader feel what Ender feels.  Even though Ender is always victorious at what he does, no matter battle or fight, he still ends up unhappy. Also throughout the book, Ender seems to be at the disadvantage all the time. This makes his life harder than it already is. Even though the challeges get harder, Ender still wins. Though the reader wants Ender to be happy, Ender stays miserable. Because of the depressive theme, the book can be, at times, difficult to read. Orson Scott Card creates a lot of futuristic technology. This technology makes the reader think about what might come in the future. An example of this technology is the childrens' desks (not like the ones we have now). The desks are video monitors that the children do all of there work on. They also have games and other applications. Ender seems to change throughout the book, from being shy and scared to confident and actually kind of obnoxious (since he's somewhat mean to other kids). Orson Scott Card makes this book a must-read for all science fiction lovers.    -Alex Rovner
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This movie, about a young Jewish man returning to Eastern Europe to learn about his family history, stirs the heart in wonderful ways. We see a story that is humorous, almost surreal, and tragic unfolding before us. We see the destinies of those in the future guided by the decisions, tragedies, and \\"happenstance\\" of the past. This insight into yesterday can prove to be both haunting and fulfilling, as this movie shows. This movie does not approach perfection, but it is very poignant. It should be watched more than once to digest its full import. Very good acting and very distinct characters. A story for Jews with a hunger to understand, and Gentiles with a desire to understand.

0061914177|5.0|Gary Vaynerchuk is an original guy with a simple approach. His lecture is \\"people\\" and he leverages them to make things happen. On Crush It! he exposes how he used Social Media to increase the profit of the family business: a liquor store.  Based on his wine knowledge Gary created a different way to explain the science behind tasting it. Lousy, foolish but direct and entertaining this guy learned how to maximize the benefits of Blogging, Twitter, Youtube, Facebook and maybe some other tools to take the business from 5 to 60 million dollars sales/year.<br /><br />Now with all the experience gathered, he cooked a recipe to succeed online using these tools. Encouraging and speaking to you like if he were in your living room, Gary has put together a super simple book that you can read in 3-4 hours. Maybe a little bit insulting to long trajectory authors but portraying what the WEB 2.0 is all about.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|The \\"Life\\" photographer who spent twenty-one 11-hour days in a hide deep in a rain forest to capture the first mating of the bower bird ever recorded on film deserved something better than Oprah's soporific drone of narration.  And so I was delighted to see that, while the Netflix version of \\"Life\\" offered only Oprah, the version narrated by the wonderful David Attenborough was available on Amazon.    Having watched, eyes narrowing, two and a half discs of the Oprahfied series, I began anew with this version, and it was like watching a completely different series. Though he appears on camera in only a few clips from older series, Sir David, a Cambridge-trained naturalist, exudes an enthusiasm for his topics that makes this series, so exquisitely caught on film, really sing.    Even if you already caught the Oprah version on TV, this version is well worth  acquiring to watch.  And it's a keeper - the intricacies of the animal world he points out are so magnificent, I know I shall watch this again and again.
160094048X|5.0|The recipes in this book are fantastic.  I've only made a few so far but they've all been excellent, and I can't wait to try more.  So far I've made the Cowboy Cookies and Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows.  I got this book from the library but will definitely be buying a copy for myself (and my mother, who can't wait to bake more vegan cookies).  The cookies don't taste \\"vegan\\"...this coming from a non-vegan (I'm just dabbling for now!)  They are decadent, delicious, and easy to make.    Before baking anything from this book I read the introductory \\"Cookie Science\\" section, and to me, that part of this book is as invaluable as the recipes themselves.  As someone who has never baked anything vegan, I wasn't quite sure how it was going to work.  The authors break down the ingredients, discuss ingredient substitutions, and explain how everything comes together to make a cookie.  There's also a short trouble-shooting section, although I haven't had to refer to that yet, which is a good sign.    So far, I've had great success with this book.  I highly recommend it to any vegans out there looking for tasty cookie recipes, or non-vegans who want to try something new.  You won't be disappointed!
B0036TGSR6|1.0|The movie starts slow the only good thing about the movie was when it ended.Had a quick reference to New World Order US blamed for what's happening in the world C I A tells England Prime minster what to do. If you like seeing the USA being the bad guy you'll like this movie. Water boarding a war crime but no reference to all cutting off peoples heads that seem to be OK. Its OK killing innocent people when getting info could save lives. A propaganda film, as you can see I dislike the movie.

0439023521|5.0|This review is for the audiobook \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />I constantly have an audiobook going, I listen in the car and while working out.  I have to admit that \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a first for me, though, in one regard.  I was so completely engrossed and immersed in this story that I didn't realize my workout time had ended and I had kept going!<br /><br />I have to say that I had heard about this series some time ago, but when I read the synopsis of this book, I thought it sounded like something that was rehashed, and too violent for me.  After a good friend recommended it, I agreed to try it.  The book is very well read, and easy to follow on audio.  The only problem with this audiobook is that you might sit in your car awhile to continue listening.  Be careful, you might find yourself holding your breath at times, too.<br /><br />This was a thoroughly enjoyable listen, and I have already downloaded and started \\"Catching Fire\\"....it is wonderful.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.
0316069485|5.0|If you ever wanted to know what really goes on between prosecution and defense tables during a murder trial then this is the book for you. The Reversal is an exciting page-turner you'll want to finish the day you get it.  A child killer was found guilty of the crime 24 years ago and he's now trying to get his conviction reversed.  This book has the best of both Connelly protaganists; Mikey Haller and Harry Bosch.  Haller, the famous defense counsel has been drafted by the District Attorney and is acting as a prosecutor along with his ex-wife as co-counsel.  Harry Bosch is asked to help find evidence that the killer sent to prison before should be re-covicted. Its a scarry story of a murdered child and how Haller's and Bosch's children might be at risk if they don't get the killer and get him fast.

0470638842|2.0|I breezed through this book over the weekend (pro = quick read) and found it mildly interesting but generally fluffy.  The book is chock full of non-provocative statements like \\"younger generations care less about privacy\\" and questionable hyperbole like \\"the 30 second TV ad format is dead\\".  Kind of a throwback to the visionary books from the 1999 dot com era that made sweeping proclamations about how the rules have entirely changed and anyone who doesn't get it is a dinosaur.      Look elsewhere if you really want to learn about either the technologies or applicable tips for penetrating social media.  This is just a kool-aid sampler.

0786955570|2.0|I just had the opportunity to play the Dungeons and Dragons Castle Ravenloft game, and I have to say that I am disappointed. Reviews I have read implied that the game was somewhat of a cross between D&D 4th edition and Betrayal at House on the Hill (an excellent cooperative game with multiple scenarios). I really wanted to like this game. Though not a fan of D&D 4th edition, I did consider that ruleset would make a great boardgame. Sadly, I found this game to be severely lacking.<br /><br />The way the game is structured, you have a scenario with a win condition known at the start of the game (the sessions I played were an escort mission, and a quest to kill a dracolich). Players then take turns moving and exploring, with player turns working much like D&D turns. The exploration system is my primary problem with the game. You go to the edge of the board, and lay down a random tile. Every tile has a monster, and every monster immediately attacks the character. There is no opportunity for reaction, tactics, etc. There are several reasons why this is problematic.<br /><br />D&D characters have strengths and weaknesses. Take, for example, the wizard. A wizard's strength is being able to attacks enemies from afar, often multiple ones. Their weakness is typically lack of ability to take damage, represented by a low hit point total. Castle Ravenloft's Exploration/Encounter system heavily penalizes the wizard character for having fewer hit points than the other characters. We came to realize that this character was just not viable for playing.<br /><br />Another weakness is the Exploration/Encounter system, as I mentioned before. Every exploration reveals an enemy. And while it is nice that all players cooperate, the tactics they use largely make them feel the same.<br /><br />Another game that occupies this same conceptual space is Descent. Also a dungeon crawl game, Descent has one player operate as the Overlord, controlling the monsters. Its gameplay is smoother and more satisfying, but it does not play so quickly. A better horror exploration game that plays in a similar amount of time is Betrayal at House on the Hill (mentioned earlier). Primarily cooperative, it uses a traitor mechanic that causes one player to unexpectedly betray the party, which sets into motion a story-driven scenario, where both the traitor and the rest of the players have distinct win conditions.<br /><br />To sum up, this is not a good game. There are planty of other good cooperative games to measure this against. The poorly-conceived systems diminish its playability, and its small number of scenarios limit its replayability. I would seriously consider either of the games previously mentioned above this.lay so quickly.

B002ZG98Z0|3.0|It's no secret that this movie is not the best of the Sex and the City franchise.  It's an over the top mess that is mildly tolerable and can even be enjoyable for some pending you don't take it too seriously.  If you do take it seriously, then you'll find yourself scratching your head at every turn.  One of them being that Carrie wants a love relationship, yet she has no clue how to be in one.  She's finally married, but moves from room to room bored and discontent with married life while harping on her husband for wanting to take it easy after work and buying her a sharp new flat screen instead of jewelry.  Her character comes off like a spoiled brat at times.  I'm guessing her character is supposed to be in her forties at this point, and yet she's still acting like a twenty-something party girl.<br /><br />The four leads head off to Abu Dhabi where they have the privilege of breaking every custom rule you can think of.  This mostly coming from the Samantha character as you can likely guess.  She's a strong business woman, but it seems she's unable to remain professional. She's unable to control herself in a foreign country and gets sexually suggestive in public whenever possible.  Typically, when one goes to a foreign country, you try to behave and adapt to that culture as best you can.  This is a movie though and not intended to be taken seriously, otherwise like me you'll be questioning every line uttered.  This is a lighthearted romp full of ridiculousness, but if you loved the show and will watch the characters read the phone book no matter what, then you'll like this.  I enjoyed it here and there, with some of those mind boggling scratching your head moments.  SATC2 is the least enlightening piece that the franchise has made, but it's not that dreadful if you have nothing else to watch.<br /><br />Some of the absurdities in this film are an outlandish gay wedding in the beginning that seems to go on for hours and for no reason.  It had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  The gay characters in this are one dimensional stereotypical charactertures.  The other outlandish moment is when the leads are in a karaoke bar and sing one of the worst songs one could choose at a karaoke bar.  It takes the cheese factor up a number of notches.  The real jaw dropping moment is the sloppy writing of this movie that forces Carrie to bump into her ex boyfriend Aidan in Abu Dhabi.  It's jaw dropping because that would never happen in a million years.  The positives of this film is the location and backdrop showcasing bright luscious scenery to a chew on.  Those who are into fashion will love the constantly changing looks accompanied by a bouncy happy soundtrack that feels as if it's one long music video.  The final plus is the continuing strong friendship between the four leads.do with the rest of the movie.  The gay characters in this are one dimensional stereotypical charactertures.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|I just watched the HBO movie Temple Grandin with Claire Danes. This is the must-see for 2010. Stunning, insightful, enlightened, tender. A sensational depiction of a remarkable life.<br /><br />I had read a bit about Temple Grandin prior to seeing this, and I was eager to observe how film could adequately show the world of autism and the unique brilliance of Dr. Grandin's mind. I was not disappointed. What I didn't expect to see was the tender and human portraits of an aunt, a mother, a daughter, and a teacher and advocate, all played masterfully by the actors in the film.<br /><br />As a mother of a boy with Aspergers, I wept at Julia Ormand's longing to hug her daughter, and felt her fear at leaving teen-aged Temple with the boarding school bullies. I cheered as she stood up to the so-called medical wisdom of the day when Temple was four years old, and swelled with victory pride as she watched her daughter graduate. Watching this movie, I experienced great hope for my son, and very few things have given me such a response.<br /><br />Beyond the perspective of a mother of an Aspie, I also watched the movie through the eyes of an Aspie myself. Claire Danes' portrait unveiled things to me on a deeply moving level. Courage, determination, vulnerability, and ingenuity are qualities that make Temple Grandin the person and Temple Grandin the movie an inspiration. I am thankful that such a project has been undertaken, and thrilled to see it done so well. This movie will set the cause of neurodiversity light years ahead. I wish this movie was on the required list of every student in the educational field.<br /><br />One more point to comment on: the sensory issues so typical of autism were brilliantly shown. Sounds that seem louder, colors and lights that come across exaggerated, the confusing blur of conversation, and the cryptic social exchanges were handled with such finesse that I had to commend the realism. Kudos to a job well done.<br /><br />Thanks, HBO, for getting so many things with this movie so right.t.
0307454541|2.0|A big meh.<br /><br />The book could have been half as long and the there were surprisingly thin plot points, along with some serious cheesiness. I assumed this book would be more literary. I think it gets that label because it's set in a relatively exotic locale. Otherwise, I guess it gets high reviews by men because of a relationship that ironically shares shades of the crimes committed.
0307455874|1.0|What a snoozer.  Beats me why anyone asked him to write this book:  at the time he wrote it he had very little experience doing much of anything.  However, it WAS interesting to note the contrasts between what he SAID he believed and how he has actually governed 18 months into his Presidential term.  My advice is PASS.
0061433047|2.0|Terry Pratchet is a wonderful writer. Or maybe better to say was a wonderful writer.  Discworld and Tiffany Aching are some of the great literary creations ever. I want them to keep going on forever, but this book is forced, stilted, and heavy handed.  As much as I love Pratchet, its hard to recommend this book.  The first half is barely readable.  There are events that seem disconnected one from the other.  The second half is better, but still not on par with other Discworld books.  He has written a few clunkers before and this, sadly, is the next clunker of a discworld book.
0817439390|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a professional photographer from whom I took classes. She says she goes back and references this book again and again, and I can see why. A must for any serious hobbyist or pro! Bryan Peterson delivers, and in this new edition updated older info from previous versions as well as added info about HDR.
0553582038|1.0|In all fairness, if I were to evaluate only the book itself only on it's literary credentials I would probably give it 2.5 stars out of 5.  However when combined with the writer's appalling work ethic and his arrogant disregard for his fans, and based on the fact that I refuse to recommend this series to anyone until he finishes, I can only give this installment of the song 1 out of 5 stars.    Feast was a train wreck. Here's a quick review by POV.    Cersei Lannister --> Crappiest POV in the series not named Catelyn Stark.  We find out that she's a delusional paranoid schizophrenic.  Yeah, we also sorta already knew that.  Jaime Lannister --> The only truly great writing in AFFC.  Jamie actually, gasps, develops as a character.  Brienne of Tarth --> Endless wanderings around Westeros when the reader already know those wanderings are entirely fruitless. No clue why we needed her POV. Complete waste.  Half of Brienne's chapter's are redundant as Jaime is there also.  We get it, she's honorable and dutiful.  Arya Stark --> Didn't Arya only get like 2 chapters? One of my favorite POV's from the first three books was completely squandered.  Sansa Stark --> My favorite non-Jaime chapters in AFFC.  Sansa is groomed to become a political player in the future installments of the series.  Samwell Tarly --> Didn't really care for his character in ASOS, and his perspective completely stagnates in AFFC. I can't remember any plot advancement.  Jon is now Lord Commander, uh yeah George, we already knew that at the end of Storm.  Aeron \\"Damphair\\" Greyjoy --> Can someone please tell me why we needed three new Iron Islands POV's?  I'm so sick of nuncling.  I just vomited on my keyboard.  Asha Greyjoy  Victarion Greyjoy  Areo Hotah --> Can someone please tell me why we needed three new Dorne POV's?  We get it, Tommen is an inept idiot, and Arianne is overmatched.  Why couldn't the Dornish have just stayed as the gun on the mantle?  We all know that the Dornish will be Dany's first allies.  Why not a bit more cloak and dagger?  Arys Oakheart  Arianne Martell    I think GRRM fell in love with expanding his world, which is exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to be doing when bringing the series to a climax. Looking back, the Dorne and Iron Islands chapters should have released as novellas peripheral to the series. The writing is good, but the plot has completely stagnated.    Why couldn't we have been treated to a Hound POV instead of Brienne's endless waste of time?

0525951652|3.0|I wanted to love the latest tome from the author of one of my favourite books (Pillars of the Earth) but at best I could settle for liking it. The story is simply how World War 1 occured from almost every possible perspective. I mean literally - Austria, Russia, England, America, all perspectives are represented by characters who spend a lot of time doing little but debating politics and having clandestine affairs.  The main problems are that there are too many characters, most of whom are very sketchily drawn, and so you do spend a lot of time thinking, \\"OK now which one is Walter? The German, the Austrian or the Russian?\\" etc. The only three-dimensional character seemed to be an uppercrust suffragette woman called Maud who at turns is both hero and snob, fighter for the working woman and yet part of the establishment. She was interesting and held the attention at all times, but she was the exception.  The politics of building a cathedral (Pillars of the Earth) prove far more fascinating than meeting after meeting in the politics of Europe pre-world war. It's tedious at times; yet also intriguing too, especially when we follow Billy, a scamp of an English miner off to the war.  The worst part was how all the central characters improbably end right in the thick of whatever is happening - one Russian lad ends up as Trotsky's right-hand man; a German character winds up advising Kaiser, and the token American is having cosy chats with his president. All a little too convenient, even for a bunch of very well-connected people at the start.  The up-side is that for all its many pages I never once seriously thought of putting the book down. You do come away with a two dimensional but historically accurate view of the lives of people in these countries during a period of immense upheaval.   But for all that I simply can't bring myself to recommend the book except to a dedicated Follett fan. It's an OK way to pass the time but it lacks depth and the story-telling pace and thrills of many of Follett's earlier books.
031606792X|4.0|I do not usually like romance novels but this one was a good read.  I am very picky about the books I read and this one met my high standards.  Good book even for those that this type of book may not be their type.  Have no idea how they are going to make an appropriate movie out of this one though.  It's a bit gruesome than the other ones.  The third book was great for those that enjoy the type of books that I like to read all action and suspense with a bit of horror mixed in.  For those that are not a fan of the Twilight movies, I would definitely recommend the 3rd novel but 4th one is a good read as well.
0765326353|5.0|Ever since I found Brandon Sanderson upon learning he was finishing the Wheel of Time series I've been hooked, but The Way of Kings is far and away his best work. He continues his amazing talent of world building and detailed characterization while keeping the pacing moving. This book is a seriously good read.
B000001GG6|5.0|Breathtakingly amazing!  Mr Zimerman has been my favorite artist for a number of years, but he's outdone himself with this one.  Many times emotion is compromised by technique.  Not here.  Tears are streaming down my face.  It's simply overwhelmingly beautiful.
B003TML0VO|4.0|Man, I can't believe all these SANTANA bashers on here!  Haters: Man up and trash your Lady Ga Ga \\"music\\"!  I liked GUITAR HEAVEN.  Granted, it's a cover project and Carlos revisits the old formula of guest artists on it.  I enjoyed the different musicians/singers (and rapper) who contributed their talents.  For sure, there are some songs that should have been left off the cd, most notably DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY (sounds like a....what else....a cover band version) and RIDERS ON THE STORM (Ray, how could you allow this sorry soulless version to be released?  Jim must be turning in his grave.)  But, there are more hits than misses: a beautiful haunting version of WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS (India.Arie & Yo-Yo Ma) rivals George's acoustic version plus the rockers WHOLE LOTTA LOVE (C Cornell was born to sing this song), PHOTOGRAPH (Daughtry is simply great) and SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE (R Thomas adds another gem to his career).  You even get fellow Woodstock (1969 version) alumni Joe Cocker lending his legendary voice to the Hendrix classic LITTLE WING.  Hell, even Nas doing a rap/rock version of BACK IN BLACK grew on me!  People, it is what it is: a SANTANA cover cd done for fun and to provide the listener with a different taste (and twist) of classic rock music.  It won't go down as a SANTANA classic, but who cares?  It still beats Lady Ga Ga (and most of these lame present day artists) \\"music\\".

B003K1EYM6|4.0|I'm not sure what I expected with the iPad camera connection kit. Reviews had been mixed. In limited use so far I've found that the USB port works well with my older Sony camera and downloads photos quickly. There are some issues with the way the iPad handles and organizes photos, but that's not a connecter issue. I have not tried the USB connecter with other USB devices, but will over the next few weeks.     The SD card also works well with the iPad and with SD cards. I've used 1, 2, and 4 BG cards in it so far. The only issue, one you have to learn on your own, is that photos or other files on the SD card have to be in a directory named DCIM to be read. Once to create the file and move photos to it, the iPad has not difficulty finding and moving them. I've also experimented with storing movies/videos on the SD card and transfering it to the iPad. The table treats movies/videos just like photos, placing them in the photo section. You can delete just as you would with a photo. The only problem is the name of the movie/video file doesn't seem to transfer with it--just the length. Apple needs to work o that.     All in all, no problems with either connecter working as adverised.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|Just received my BK2 yesterday, all I can say is \\"What a knife\\". I read all the reviews and was impressed with the very high ratings it received. It will not disappoint you. The knife overall has great fit and finish and the sheath is pretty good also. The couple of negative things I read about the knife are easily fixed. The first problem is that handle bolts loosen after use. The three hex bolts holding the handle need to be threadlocked as soon a you get it. The second problem is the slick handle. The handle does feel great in the hand, but it is slickish. The easy fix is to cut about a 2 1/2\\" length piece from a mountin bike inter-tube. Carefully slide that over the handle and slide it toward front of the handle so the retaining strap will still fit around the handle. With that installed on the handle it's about the best feeling stable knife handle I have ever felt. The sheath holds the knife very tightly and you can't pull it out very easily. But I discovered if you grip the handle in your right hand and push the sheath with your right thumb it easily disengages the sheath. Maybe that is common knowledge for everyone who owns this knife, but it's something I had to mention.
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I watched this movie on a flight coming back from Rome in September, and it became apparent to me that Kim Cattrall's character Samantha is the funniest!!! Kim has more charisma than the rest of the girls put together!!! While SJP was enjoyable in the TV version, she looks stiff and her acting is pretty boring, no emotion at all....  While I did laugh at a few spots, it is a pretty forgettable movie. FYI, watch this movie while your drinking!!!
B003OMPMAO|3.0|I never liked Bella.    The reason this review is a three and not a four is because part of the book is from the point-of-view of Jacob, a guy I legitimately care about. And no spoilers here, but the ending is the most saccharine thing I've read, even worse than Harry Potter's ending.    Still, should Twilight fans read it? Yeah. It's good to have closure, even if that closure is incredibly lame. All the vampires that are introduced in the second half introduce new ideas and worlds that were not thought of. I would like to see Stephanie Meyer talk about some of these other covens in a 'Short Second Life of Bree Tanner'-esque story.    Still, definitely the lowest-liked Twilight saga installment.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|They awaken in a jungle, one unfamiliar to any of them.  They're the best of the best.  They're trained to kill.  They have one-word names like Royce and Cuchillo and Mombasa.  And they're all about to be hunted by a race of alien predators unlike anything they've ever imagined.<br /><br />Right now: you're either in or out.  Odds are, you're in.  Considering that the franchise has only two real films (I'd rather discount the ALIEN tie-ins if it's all the same to you), and only one of those was really any good (admit it!), PREDATOR has been pretty damn popular.  You know the name brings with it sci-fi action/adventure, with a good dash of horror.  Artfully, none of the PREDATOR films (this one included) could possibly stand up to the first ALIEN, even though they have all tried to do so.  But you don't watch a PREDATOR film for art.  You watch it for the fun.<br /><br />And PREDATORS is fun.  Plain and simple.  Lending the project credibility with his serious acting chops (mostly on hold here; he's camping it up with delight) is Adrien Brody, one of the more unlikely action heroes (though he carried his own in KING KONG, remember).  We've got Alice Braga as a tough-as-nails chick with attitude, Danny Trejo as a Mexican mercenary, and Laurence Fishburne giving a surprisingly good turn as a man who's been in-country a mite too long.  (It's interesting to see Fishburne and Brody, two genuinely good actors, playing off each other; kind of makes you wish there was more of that, but then again, that would be a whole different movie.)  We've got the prerequisite Japanese, Russian, and African toughies, and Topher Grace as a wise-cracking doctor.  (Grace is another highlight, at least until the final quarter of the film, and even then, I blame the writers.)  The Predators themselves look great--and we've got quite a variety, too.  I won't say the filmmakers have given them any emotional depth (they're freakin' Predators, man!), but it's nice to see some diversity.  And what a killer climax.<br /><br />Overall, the film borrows heavily from the first, and that's okay--it's done with a wink and a nod.  They know it, you know it, let's get it out of the way and have some fun.  The atmosphere is tense, the cinematography spectacular, the pace adequately suspenseful.  The script falters a bit, and there's a \\"twist\\" near the end that is entirely pointless, and generally weighs the film down.  Still, for what it is--and that isn't much, granted--PREDATORS is a fine way to kill a Saturday evening.  Leave it to producer Robert Rodriguez to put a little umph back into a dying franchise, though one can't help but wonder what the film would've been like if Rodriguez had chosen to write/direct it as well.  Perhaps next time?.    Overall, the film borrows heavily from the first, and that's okay--it's done with a wink and a nod.  They know it, you know it, let's get it out of the way and have some fun.

B00129H7VS|5.0|The tile of my review is not hyperbole.  Out of every movie, TV servies, video, or documentary I have ever seen, I enjoyed this mini-series from HBO and Speilberg/Hanks the most.  I loved every minute of the 10 hour series: the dialog, the character development, the cinematography, the action, and especially the Michael Kamen soundtrack.  It was a shame he died before he could score the followup series, The Pacific.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|A bit racy at times due to the sex scenes, I loved the series.  It was action packed and kept you on the edge of your seat wondering how Spartacus would exact his revenge.  This is not for the feint of heart as it was pretty gory and explicit.  It took me a bit to figure out who Lucy Lawless was until my husband told me she was blond! Still looks good at her age.  All in all, I highly recommend the series, characters had dimension and it was very well acted.  Can't wait for season two!
193413712X|5.0|This novel is a kaleidoscope of beautiful views of life.  Often startling, always touching, it draws the reader into a unique way of seeing the world we live in.
0553805371|5.0|This book is the most mentally challenging and interesting book I have ever read (numerous times).  My brief summary follows:    In the beginning the Supreme Being created the Law of the Conservation of Energy and everything else (to include the 10 to the 500th power of possible universes and the 11 dimensions of life) derived from this law.  The Supreme Being further said, \\"I have given some of you brains to figure this all out, so don't get too wrapped around the axle as you progress in understanding your existence.\\"  And the Supreme Being concluded by saying, \\"I exist because I exist, but you don't.\\"
1423101499|4.0|So far, this has been my favorite book in the Percy Jackson series.  To quickly recap the series, the first book (Lightning Thief) was a great introduction and did a nice job of character and world/plot development.  The second book (Sea of Monsters) was a cool follow up and an intriguing semi-retelling of parts of the Odyssey while also introducing plenty of new elements in Percy's world.  Book three (Titan's Curse) continued to build upon the curse hovering over Percy's life as well as bringing in some more cool elements.    With Book Four, we're taken into the Labyrinth.  Specifically, war is approaching in the form of demigods, humans and others supporting either the cause of the gods of Olympus or the Titan Kronos.  It seems there's an entrance/exit to the labyrinth tucked inside Camp Half Blood thus giving Kronos's army the potential to invade the training ground of Olympus's army.    I really enjoyed seeing the dynamics of the overall struggle play out while at the same time making sure that this single adventure had the strength to stand on its own.  The central characters continued to be well developed though at times I had trouble deciding if they were developing/growing too fast or too slow.  There were times that it seemed like they were doing things above what I expected and other times that it felt like they were behaving far below their capacity.    I found Daedalus an intriguing character as well, especially the way he was first and finally introduced to us.  It made me want to go back and reread segments to see if we'd been given any hints previously to lead to the events that come to pass.  I liked the morality tale that came from Daedalus's story.    I found the \\"romantic\\" element interesting...the tension caused by the introduction of another potential love interest for Percy.  I was glad that Riordan made Percy somewhat oblivious to Annabeth's jealousy and made him nervous and unsure about his emotions.  I was also pleased that the romance stayed mostly in the background.  At the same time, it was sometimes troubling to see Annabeth getting so flustered over the whole thing...as the daughter of Athena, her head should certainly rule her heart, especially when she's placed in her current role...still, she is a teenager and it's understandable for there to be tension and jealousy.  I hope we get to see more of Rachel Elizabeth Dare in the final book of this series.    I enjoyed the narrative arc and the general structure.  However, I felt a little \\"jipped\\" sometimes since the narration follows tightly over Percy's shoulder and leaves us in the dark about other events happening concurrently.  When Percy is separated from Grover and Tyson, I would have prefered some interspersed chapters following their adventures rather than just a quick sum-up when they got back together.  I also would have been interested to have some scenes show what was going on at camp.  Still, I applaud Riordan for staying true to his chosen form...to change now (in book four) may have been disorienting.    The adventure was fairly straightforward....sometimes the challenges facing Percy seemed to be overcome too easily.  He is our hero, but sometimes his heroics seem even much for a demigod.  I'm glad he survived another adventure, but would have liked to have seen him get into a little more trouble.    Overall, I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the conclusion of the series.  It's been a lot of fun to read through these with my kids.  They're family friendly and make for entertaining adventures.    ****  4.5 out of 5 stars
0385342047|5.0|I hate this book. Why?, you may wonder. Because I LOVED it so much. And now nothing seems to live up to it. I mean, I am enjoying the book I'm reading now, but I can't help but keep thinking \\"I WANT MORE BECKY BLOOMWOOD!\\" I love her! I love Sophie Kinsella, and it's possible that, aside some brief frustration in the beginning, this is THE best yet in the Shopaholic series.<br /><br />In Mini Shopaholic, Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) is BACK and more compulsively crazier and fabulous than ever. Her antics are everything readers of the Shopaholic series have come to expect - and more. Especially now that she has her two year old, Minnie, growing up under her influence. While Minnie and Minnie's relationship with her mother are sometimes slightly frustrating (you're just going to have to read the book if you want to know why), will immediately hook the reader in and entertain them nonstop right up until the end.<br /><br />Whoever decided that Becky should/could have children (perhaps Sophie Kinsella of herself!) must have been crazy - and brilliant. It is hilariously entertaining, and the background of the financial crisis and the big CB (cut back) just make it all the more so. In Mini Shopaholic, Kinsella has masterfully constructed a hilarious, crazy story that will leave you wanting more and feeling like you maybe got a little bit too much at the same time.<br /><br />And that's really the only problem with this book. With Becky's crazy antics and Becky's mother's crazy antics and Minnie's crazy antics and Janice's crazy antics, it can sometimes be a bit much, and for people that aren't already familiar and in love with the Shopaholic series, I can see how it could be a bit difficult. Unless, you're perhaps a little bit crazy. And then you'll relate. Like I do.<br /><br />Seriously, though, this book is good. And if you love the Shopaholic series, the chances of you continuing to love it with this book are high. It's fabulous! And trust be, you'll be losing sleep waiting for Sophie Kinsella to write the next book in the series! I can't wait!ite the next book in the series! I can't wait!
0439023513|4.0|I picked up Mockingjay on release day but it took me a few days to crack the cover.  Once I did, I was annoyed with the times I had to set the book down.  Picking up just after the cliffhanger from Catching Fire, this book just keeps ratcheting up the intensity and doesn't back down until the conclusion.    I could theoretically see this book as being a \\"stand-alone\\" experience, but you would likely miss many of the nuances and references if you just jumped to book 3 without reading #s 1 and 2.  Still, I'll try to speak about this book individually and avoid spoilers either for Mockingjay or for the series as a whole.    Katniss's world is in absolute chaos as the book begins.  She's gained a lot but lost a lot more.  Worse, she has tons of new questions to try and answer but no sure fire way to find answers.  From a high level, this explanation can be applied to each book in the series.  And yet, book 3 is actually quite a different experience from the other two.    In Mockingjay we find Katniss given a bit more latitude to become her own character and to express her own desires, needs and personality.  The problem is, she has a hard time figuring out what those may be.    Similar to the previous books, a number of strategic alliances are made, but on a much larger scale.  Everything is much, much bigger in this book....the action, the conflict, the fears, the anxiety, the uncertainty.  Another thing that seemed even more accentuated to me was the nature and presence of evil.  President Snow (that vile, noxious dictator of a leader) is much more at the forefront of this book....and a variety of other similar characters are presented.      In fact, the concepts of \\"what is good\\", \\"what is right\\", \\"what is true\\", are almost always in question such that it often felt like most of the characters were living either in grey area or perhaps in some form of darkness...there were very few who were obviously \\"good\\".  Because of this, I sometimes found my reading sessions tobe emotionally draining.  This novel is definitely not for the overly sensitive/empathic/faint-of-heart.  Not that it was horrifically violent (there was a bit more violence, but it didn't feel over-the-top) but rather, there is just so much antagonism and opposition that the sense of hopelessness felt in the first two books has been multiplied exponentially in book 3.    After I finished reading, my wife (who is nervous about reading it) asked if \\"it ends well.\\"  All I can say (without spoiling the story) is that \\"it ends as well as can be expected considering how truly awful Panem is.\\"  That's actually probably a little harsh...I can certainly think of a number of \\"good\\" ways the book could have ended which would have been much \\"worse\\" in terms of \\"happy endings.\\"   What I will say is that if you're looking for a happy ending....you might find it, but you'll have to look real close and make sure you don't overthink things.    I really enjoyed the series.  Mockingjay is a bit of a change from the previous two.  I'm not sure if it's because of this (necessary) departure or if it was something else, but I did not enjoy book 3 as much as the previous 2.  I'd have a hard time picking between Catching Fire and Hunger Games (book 1), but I can definitely say that I liked them both a little better than I liked Mockingjay.    That said, I can still definitely recommend Mockingjay as an engrossing, well-written, and enjoyable book that brings closure to the atrocities of Panem...as best it can.    Give it a read.  It's well worth it.    ****  4 out of 5 stars
B00007KQA3|5.0|Orwell's classic depiction of a totalitarian government oppressing society to the brink of stupidity, and the disheartening tale of Winston Smith's defeat in his fight against the system, is depicted in this enlightening film, with John Hurt portraying a demure, sullen Smith.<br /><br />The film's plot follows suit to the novel's quite religiously, with only minor changes made to suit the traversal from the mind's eye to the big screen; Big Brother is as you would expect: menacing, imposing, consuming. Smith also fits one's mental picture: tired, repressed, possessing only a few glimmers of hope enveloped in a thick blue fabric of depression.<br /><br />The scenario, costuming, and effects are fitting to the book. While not overpowering the viewer, they communicate the atmosphere that the Party has created, from the dark alleys in the prole section to the foreboding building, the Ministry of Truth, that Winston is tortured in.<br /><br />The film only falls short of its mark in the field of intensity. At times, Orwell stresses his characters in situations almost unimaginable to the mind's eye; in the film, these same situations are portrayed rather apathetically. Artistic rights aside, the depiction could have included more of Orwell's original thematic interplay with Winston's torturous ordeals after being captured. Nevertheless, the film is an excellent depiction of the novel, and is an artistic work of its own merit. END
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I really liked this movie. It was well written and believable. Beutiful scenery as well.
B002ZG981E|5.0|All I can say after viewing this film is thank god someone in 2010 got it right. Christopher Nolan's magnum opus Inception knocks it out of the park and onto the moon with this one. For a film that took over a decade to pen it certainly shows in the easy to watch 2.5 epic film that bends the mind, tugs at the heart and breathes style. Those who have not seen it I will not give anything away, but be warned you will want to watch it again once it's over. DiCaprio leads an all star cast into what is the 'world of the dream', Hans Zimmer's haunting and superb orchestral's really add to the overall mood of the film and completely make the film an experience then a typical night at the movies. I personally thought that there was nothing cheesy at all about the movie, the dialogue is spot on and the plot completely pulls you in immediately. Despite everything so far this year either being mind-numbing supernatural vampires, superheroes and what-not, do yourself a a favor and see this film. Blu-ray is guaranteed to look amazing in HD as well, so that's an incentive as well. For those of you who read this review *SPOILER* Edward Cullen gets with Bella in the last film (shocker) there now you can stop waiting on that and have time to appreciate this film.
B003UYUR10|5.0|\\"What a deal\\" A great movie at a great deal. Way below retail in stores price.
B003YCI1PM|5.0|I love Selena Gomez! I love pop, though, so if that isn't your thing, you probably won't like it as much. I liked the variety in how the songs sounded. Some of the lyrics were a bit corny (like \\"your love is off the chain\\") but I still really enjoyed the music that went along with them. My favorite is \\"Intuition.\\" I also really like the different feel of \\"Rock God.\\"
B000026BDY|4.0|I can't explain how excited I was to hear that Whitesnake was finally releasing their long awaited follow-up to `Slide It In' in the early spring of 1987. The first single \\"Still of the Night\\" was an absolute monster and it was much heavier then I remember Whitesnake ever being. When the self-titled LP finally came, I have to admit, I was a little disappointed. This was not the Whitesnake sound that I had originally fallen in love with but was in reality a much different band that was primed to take the hair metal world by storm! David Coverdale, after years of European success but American indifference remade the blues rock foundation of the first band and created a heavy metal juggernaut. John Sykes played a seriously blistering metal guitar and much of the blues trappings of the earlier years were much more subtle. So why was `Whitesnake' (or `1987') such a disappointment for me? Because the band that ruled the radio and MTV airwaves was not the REAL Whitesnake of 1978-1984. Also some of the \\"hits\\" still make me cringe today (almost threw up in my mouth the first time I heard \\"Is This Love\\"). \\"Crying in the Rain\\" and \\"Here I Go Again\\" were recorded songs originally found on the `Saints n' Sinners' LP and here they definitely improved during the makeover. I may be in the minority but I have never given this record as much love as its mega sales status would expect. A sell out is a sellout but at least it was better than the follow- up, but that's another story. \\"Still of the Night\\" is a classic and \\"Here I Go Again\\" may be the ultimate power ballad but give me the old Whitesnake any day!

B000GPIPSS|3.0|Obviously, anyone buying Dracula on DVD doesn't need to read reviews about how great of a classic it is.<br /><br />The packaging of these Universal Legacy Series DVDs are HORRIBLE. I have returned 4 due to the disc trays inside the cardboard case not being adhered to the actual case. They just fell right out when I opened them.<br /><br />Also, one of them had a huge round sticker on the OUTSIDE OF THE BEAUTIFUL CASE!! It ruined it when I took it off. I would have left it but it was holding on a flapping piece of paper and had to be removed.<br /><br />I guess I will try the \\"The Legacy Collection\\" next time. At least the Creature From the Black Lagoon is in that collection.<br /><br />Movie: 5 stars<br />Case: 0 stars<br /><br />I split the difference with 3 stars but I recommend buying a different version of the movie.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|The character of Robin Hood is very intriguing.  Ever since I first saw Errol Flynn don tights and Olivia DeHavilland  wow movie goers (on Golden Cloud-Trigger) many years ago, I have missed few Hood films.<br /><br />Kevin Costners' Robin Hood was okay, but this presentation is stunning.  From authentic looking sets to period dramatic flairs, this one has you hooked.  Russell Crowe is Loxley, aka Robin Hood pre-Prince John, and while other versions deal with Robin after his outlaw years, this is a prequel.  For that reason, it is able to touch new ground and break any pre-conceptions.  It succeeds.<br /><br />We have Robin, Maid Marian, Little John, Prince John (pre-tyrant), and Friar Tuck.  Each of the characters gets their chance to breathe, and develop.  For instance, while we think Prince John is going to go along with the treaty he helped establish, he rejects it and sets up Robin to be an outlaw...we know the rest of the story from there.  It is entirely possible this sets up a sequel, at this point, we are not sure.<br /><br />Cast chemistry, set dressing, location scouting, and stunt choreography/set up is top notch.  Where Rome and Spartacus set standards for TV accuracy, this Robin Hood sets the bar high.<br /><br />Five arrows!

B0032JTV74|5.0|Ordered the Glee first season and love every minute of it. I am not a broadway song and dance guy but the clever fusion of music and story line in Glee makes it compelling TV. Give the show a chance and it will grow on you. Second season has also started off with a bang.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|We sat down together and watched this with our children ranging from ages 11-15. We all liked this movie, it was well acted. This movie is about two good friends who decide to go on a ski trip, with one young man bringing his girlfriend along for the new experience of snow boarding. Bribing the ski lift ticket man for just one more ride up the mountain at the end of his shift. Then when the ski lift ticket keeper takes a break to use the restroom, the man relays the message to his shift relief that there's three more skiers on the mountain, and not to stop the ski lift. When the new ticket man sees three skiers, he assumes those were the last skiers and turns off the ski lift, and abandons the mountain for the next five days due to terrible storms ahead. Needless to say the three young adults are stranded on the ski lift way in the air, and no one in sight to help them. Knowing they will be stuck there for the next five days, one young man decides to jump down off the lift, only to break both his legs, and stressing out the two remaining stranded man and woman. Without food, water, and warmth, and a wounded man under them, panic sinks in, and so do the wolves below. How will they get out of this predicament? You have to watch and find out for yourself! Good movie, great for teenagers....they like these type of flicks. My kids liked it, and so did we. Kind of predicable, but action packed, and well acted. Enjoy this movie with your friends or family. Not recommended for kids younger than 10, I would say. Some people would say no one under 13, but my kids have seen a lot worse than this. Jarassic Park is way more graffic, and they loved that one too. Enjoy!
0316069884|5.0|This book should be required reading for everyone.  You know in the back of your mind and heart that factory farming is bad but that is where it stays.  I am as guilty as anyone else.  No more!  I do not see how you could read this book and not become an instant vegetarian.  99% of meat comes from factory farms!!  That statistic just boggles my mind.  What an important, life-changing book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!  I am an adult who teaches middle school reading, and I love reading young adult literature.  I was SO irritated with myself for not bringing Catching Fire with me on the long car trip when I finished The Hunger Games!  I was on the edge of my seat!  This book is incredible!!
