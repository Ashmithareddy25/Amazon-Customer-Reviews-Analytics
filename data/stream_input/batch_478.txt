B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie was amazing, I thought that Emmy Rossum did a fabulous job as Christine Daae and Patrick Wilson played the ever charming Raoul perfectly. I also thought thought that Butler did a wonderful job of the phantom, very deep and powerful, which was essential the character's personality. The songs are perfect and Andrew Loyd Weber even wrote extra ones just for the movie. It's filled with romance, suspense and music. It was so incredible I saw it six times in the theater and am axiously awaiting its arrival on DVD. The live performance was the best I'd ever seen, but if you don't get a chance to see it, rent this movie, it'll feel like you're there!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is the best compilation album ever! It typically rocks! <br />I listen to this album a lot. A lot of these songs are really <br />great. There are a few must not haves for this album but let me <br />review all these songs. <br /> <br />Welcome to the Jungle-Great opening song with some of the best <br />rock ever. It'll make you want to jump around and bang your head. <br /> <br />Sweet Child of Mine-Maybe the best song on this compilation. <br />Slash plays the solo great. This is definately one of my favorite <br />songs of all time. <br /> <br />Patience-Slow but good, but where the heck are Steven's drums. <br />But this song always puts me in a good mood. <br /> <br />Paradise City-A must listen for any rock fan. This song is so <br />awesome. Give it five stars on. The beginning of this song is <br />really great. <br /> <br />Knocking on Heaven's Door-Great song but gets boring fast. <br /> <br />Civil War-One of my favorite songs of all time. This song is true <br />about war and history. Great understanding song. <br /> <br />You Could Be Mine-One of my favorite songs on this album. This <br />song has a great heavy metal sound that you'll love. One of the <br />best on this album. <br /> <br />Don't Cry-Muchly the weakest song on this album. <br /> <br />November Rain-This is the best song ever! The riff is so awesome <br />by Slash. Axl does the vocals great. The whole song is nine minutes of excellent music. This is typically my favorite song on <br />this album. Great song. <br /> <br />Live and Let Die-Yet another awesome song. This one delivers great drums by Sorum. And other than that, Axl sings right in <br />this song. <br /> <br />Yesterdays-Attitude, bad attitude. <br /> <br />Ain't it Fun-Very bad, take this off this compilation because <br />this song has lots of sex,drugs,alcohol,liquor,violence,and more. <br />This song is not like Guns N' Roses at all. Has bad attitude. <br /> <br />Since I Don'T Have You-This is marginally better. This is more <br />like GN'R. But still not as great as the rest. <br /> <br />Sympathy for the Devil-Take this song off this compilation it <br />is the stupidest song ever. Lots of sex, drugs, alcohol, liquor, <br />violence. <br /> <br />Overall great CD. I recommend you Sultans of Swing: The Very Best <br />of Dire Straits and Appetite for Destruction if you like this CD.
B000002KKS|5.0|This is the greatest LP ever recorded.  You don't have to believe me.  Buy it and find out for yourself.<br /><br />This is Black Sabbath's first album without Ozzy, and Dio's divine performance reveals all of the band's former front man's shortcomings.  Dio has better tone, better range, and better lyrics, and is just much more powerful than anything the band released in the 70's, though most those albums stand on their own as heavy metal masterpieces.<br /><br />Also improved are the guitar sound and the rhythm section.  Iommi crunches out riffs that are more than heavy, more than fast, and more than perfect.  Bill ward proves he can play straight 4/4 and do it incredibly well, and Geezer plays bass in a way that is unparalleled in rock.<br /><br />Every song is great, the production is good, and the lyrics will suck you in.  From the opening chords of \\"Neon Nights\\" to the last tear-jerking chorus and solo in \\"lonely is the word\\" Heaven and Hell will enthrall you.  It is utter musical perfection and I have no doubt that it will never be equaled.<br /><br />Heaven and Hell is proof that metal can be powerful, melodic, heavy, and meaningful all at the same time.  It is not just for metal heads, but anyone who loves real music.<br /><br />Again, utter musical perfection. The best album ever recorded.
B000003TA4|5.0|Smells Like Teen Spirit is the best song ever! Nirvana's best <br />work on it is the riff and drums and vocals. Kurt does great vocals on that song. Even the YEAH! chant and \\"With the lights <br />out, it's less dangerous, and here we are now, entertain us\\". <br />This song calls to be one of my favorite songs of all time.  <br />Others are great like In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, & Lithium. Great CD.
0440237688|4.0|This book changed my life. I don't mean that in a cheesy Lifetime Movie sort of way, but it made me reexamine reality, psychology, and all those things I take for granted. What must it be like to be unable to feel love? How important is color in my life? Why do we need memories and what would life be like without the strong interpersonal relationships that I've formed with my friends and family? These are very deep and difficult issues that are brought up in \\"The Giver,\\" which makes it a million steps above so many other books in its age category.<br /><br />When I first read this, I must have been no more than eleven years old. At the time, it was one of the more profound things I'd read and I marvelled at the issues and the symbolism, such as how the emergence of color was used artfully to express the growth of a whole new consciousness and awareness.<br /><br />I am now twenty years old, and I've read it a great number of times since I was eleven. As I've gotten older, I've come to appreciate the anger and confusion faced by Jonas as he tries to deal with these completely foreign ideas. However, I've also come to appreciate the gaping plot holes and unresolved issues, the far too quick ending and the realistic problem of figuring out population decline.<br /><br />These things don't make the book bad, in fact it's still one of the best books I can remember reading. They do, though, make me feel the need to take at least one star off of the rating. As an older and more accomplished writer today, I would like to see Lois Lowry tackle these holes in the constructed society of \\"The Giver.\\" This book is recommended for anyone, however. It's meaty enough for adults to sink thier teeth into it, but it's straightforward enough for younger people to understand the concepts raised.
B00000DGUY|5.0|This is the best CD ever made. It typically has all my favorite <br />songs on it. It has even Heavy Fuel. A lot of these songs are <br />really great. Now I want to review all the songs on this great CD <br /> <br />1. Sultans of Swing-Excellent album beginner. Instant classic of <br />the late 70's. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Lady Writer-Yet the guitars are amazing in this song. 9/10 <br /> <br />3. Romeo and Juliet-Okay but not really good. 5/10 <br /> <br />4. Tunnel of Love-Great song, one of my favorites on this album. <br />This song has a typical great rock sound you'll ever hear from <br />the straits. One of their best songs of all time and is one of <br />my favorite Dire Straits songs of all time. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Private Investigations-Too slow for me. 4/10 <br /> <br />6. Twisting by the Pool-Funny, great surf tune to listen to. <br />I bet this song goes best on the beach. It does. But not my favorite. 8/10 <br /> <br />7. Love Over Gold-Skip it, it's live. 0/10 <br /> <br />8. So Far Away-I was talking about going to Peoria, Il alone one <br />night when I played this song because I was so far away from my <br />family. One of their best and one of my favorites. 9/10 <br /> <br />9. Money for Nothing-What an Intro. One of my favorite Straits <br />songs of all time. This version is even better. Typical heavy <br />metal style for the song. This and Heavy Fuel are very simular. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Brothers in Arms-Too slow for me. Not a classic rock song at <br />all. 4/10 <br /> <br />11. Walk of Life-Bad, change the cheap electric organ to the Knopfler style guitar then I would like this song better but the <br />whole song is terrible. 3/10 <br /> <br />12. Calling Elvis-This is much better. The six minute version is <br />way better. But still really good. 9/10 <br /> <br />13. Heavy Fuel-Now this is my favorite song on the entire compilation. It is a great intro. It is a typical heavy metal <br />style guitar. Mark rules on this song. Great song. 100/10 <br /> <br />14. On Every Street-Just a peaceful song to a rock song. This <br />song always puts me in a good mood. Great ending. 9/10 <br /> <br />Overall, great CD. A must have for any rock fan.  <br /> <br />Thank you very much and I hope you buy it. <br /> <br />
B000687M48|3.0|I love Evanescence. I bought their CD \\"Fallen\\" the first day it was released. I don't own \\"Origin\\" but I have listened to it and it is amazing. Amy Lee's voice is both clear and powerful, whether she is singing rock or sitting at the piano and singing. However, I don't see much potential here. I found the CD mostly exceptional, while the DVD was okay.    The highlights of this album are the bonus tracks. On the live performances from \\"Fallen\\", sometimes you can't hear the beginning of the songs because there is so much screaming (whoever edited this CD could've worked harder on the editing part).  The bonus tracks include \\"Thoughtless\\", \\"Farther Away\\", \\"Breathe No More\\", and \\"Missing.\\" \\"Thoughtless\\" is a remake of Korn's song. It is a powerful song about betrayal with rocking guitars in the background. \\"Farther Away\\" is another rocking song about how upset you are by what you've become. \\"Breathe No More\\" is a sad, emotional song with an acoustic guitar; similar to the song \\"My Immortal.\\" Amy Lee's voice shines in this song, able to hit the highest notes. \\"Missing\\" is a ballad that shows off Amy's clear voice. Basically, the bonus tracks are the great part of this album.    I can't say that I liked the live concert part of the DVD as much. I almost got an aneurysm and was very dizzy after seeing the concert part of the DVD. The camera switches very fast and doesn't focus on one member of the group. It was hard to tell if some of the band was playing. (I think Amy's voice, the piano, and the drums were the only instruments that were really playing--everything else seemed pre-recorded.) The DVD has some high parts, though; the DVD includes all of the music videos. This includes \\"Going Under\\", \\"My Immortal\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\", and their newest single, \\"Everybody's Fool.\\" The behind-the-scenes section includes bloopers, life on the road, and more. Their band is hysterical. Amy is just like everyone else!    In conclusion, if you don't have \\"Fallen\\", then get that CD andskip this one. If you're not a huge Evanescence fan, it would be wise to skip this, or you might be disappointed.
0060512806|3.0|Pretty good read. But the ending was a total disappointment. This is the only Stephenson I've read but I was really turned off by his apparent obsession with the phallus. I know in some quarters this makes the book \\"edgy\\", but I found the main characters' inability to think striaght without frequent orgasms juvenile. At times I thought I was reading some lame feminist characterization of men. It was ridiculous.
B0007O38F8|1.0|This album is a joke compared to his previous release.  50 Cent has 1 style, 1 type of song, 1 type of flow, 1 type of lyric, and 1 type of beat.  After hearing all of that before, I couldn't stand hearing it again. \\"Candy Shop\\" is almost the exact same beat as \\"Magic Stick\\".  His ego even drives him to disrespect talented rappers like Nas and Jadakiss.  DO NOT BUY THIS, unless you one of those people who love to buy oversaturated crap constantly played out on the radio.
B000002GVO|5.0|I heard the three hit singles from Hotel California waaaay too much on the radio back in 1977. And now Classic Rock stations play the song \\"Hotel California\\" so much that I have to turn the radio off when it comes on, or else get sick of what is actually a great song (\\"Stairway To Heaven Syndrome\\" psychologists call it). I was, however, a big fan of the album from the git-go, hearing it for the first time in late-December 1976, when the album was played in its entirety by the local rock station.<br /><br />Falling out of love with Classic Rock sometime in the late 70's, I didn't listen to it much again until recently. Hearing it now, I enjoy \\"side\\" 2 much better than side 1, which puts me firmly in the minority of most Eagles fans. This may be due to my overexposure to the radio hits on side 1, but also because I love the Joe Walsh and Randy Meisner songs on side 2. They provide a nice break from Don Henley's singing, which is great but tends to produce \\"listener fatigue\\" when he handles too many of the lead vocals (and lest you think I'm not a Henley fan, \\"The Boys Of Summer\\" is one of my all-time favorite songs, period).<br /><br />\\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\" is somewhat reminiscent of Joe Walsh's work on his first (and best) solo album, 1973's Barnstorm. \\"Pretty Maids,\\" like most of Barnstorm, is a nice deviation from Walsh's more well-known guitar rave-ups. It was written with Barnstorm-mate Joe Vitale, and has a dreamy, richly-textured production, utilizing piano (Walsh) and synthesizer (Walsh & Glenn Frey). It also has some nice percussion work from Henley and, as usual, heavenly background harmonies.<br /><br />\\"Try And Love Again\\" is one of my favorite Eagles songs, and easily the most underrated song on this album (I even love the syntactic faux pas of the title). Great vocals and guitars. It has been called the Eagles' last country-rock song, but to me it sounds more like a hybrid of early-70's Southern California Rock and mid-60's Merseybeat/Searchers-style Pop (with the bright, ringing guitars and chord structure built around the loping D major). It also provides Frey with one of the best guitar solos in the Eagles canon, which is quite a feat considering the great players, past and present, in this band. I'm not sure why this track was never released as a single - maybe because Meisner was on the way out? Too country-rock, which the Eagles were trying to move away from, partly to win over rock critics (some success) but mostly to broaden their fan base (much success)? It's too bad that Meisner didn't use this type of musical setting as a starting point for what looked to be a promising solo career, rather than releasing a series of (mostly) lame, generic rock albums. Not that he would have sold any more records, but it would have made a few of us happy. Regardless, I have missed his great vocals (lead and harmony) on subsequent Eagles recordings, and I haven't even mentioned his talents as a bass player. Oh well, Meisner fans among the Eagles' throngs appear to be few and far between. But if you need proof, compare his vocal performance on \\"Take It To The Limit\\" with Frey's more recent renderings. The difference between good and goose-pimply.<br /><br />As good as the individual Eagles are as lead vocalists, they seem to be even better as background singers. In fact, when I think of the \\"classic\\" Eagles vocal sound, I think of their background harmonies, whether it's Meisner's soaring high-harmony or Henley and Frey's vocal blend, which seems to take on a separate voice all its own (for a great example of this on a non-Eagles track, listen to Dan Fogelberg's \\"Someone's Been Telling You Stories\\").<br /><br />Back to Hotel California. I think \\"The Last Resort\\" is a great closer, but Henley almost ruins it by getting preachy in the final verse. I said almost. It's still a great song, even though you know it was written by a smug millionaire rock star (sorry Don, at least I didn't call you a hypocrite or a - gasp - liberal, and actually \\"smug\\" may be unfair).<br /><br />It goes without saying (I know, I've already said it) that the guitar work on Hotel California (by Frey, but especially Don Felder and Walsh) really kicks this album up a notch. And that's coming from someone who loved Bernie Leadon's Clarence White-inspired playing on all those great early Eagles songs (e.g. \\"Take It Easy\\").<br /><br />For some reason, the Eagles are loathed by most alt-country and \\"progressive\\" country bands - probably stemming from Gram Parsons' and several prominent rock critics' dislike of them - while being embraced by many current Country Radio artists and fans. Emmylou Harris and Chris Hillman don't even like the term \\"country-rock\\" and look like you poo-pooed on their cowboy boots if it's mentioned to describe their music (they prefer Parsons' term \\"Cosmic American Music\\" - which I don't think will ever catch on). But to be honest, Gram must have been a little envious of the radio play the Eagles were getting, while he was getting virtually none. Current Country artists, such as Toby Keith, certainly have more in common with the Eagles (at least Henley and Frey) when it comes to arrogance and the personal dislikability factor.<br /><br />But unless you enjoy throwing the baby out with the proverbial bathwater, you have to give the Eagles, and this album in particular, its due. And if you haven't heard the DVD-Audio version in surround sound, then you need to. Awesome. Now, excuse me while I go online and purchase a pair of tickets to their current farewell tour. Anybody have a spare $400?r a - gasp - liberal, and actually \\"smug\\" may be unfair).  <br /> <br />It goes without saying (I know, I've already said it) that the guitar work on Hotel California (by Frey, but especially Don Felder and Walsh) really kicks this album up a notch.

B000667GFK|5.0|In my opinon \\"Mexico en la Piel\\" is timeless, people of all ages can listen to it and enjoy a song or two. It was well made and Luis Miguel sings just as beautifully as he has before. KUDOS to Luis Miguel this album is one of his best ones yet. I am proud to say that he represents mexican music very well. I believe that we all are entitled to our opinions and not all of us will like the same things so perhaps the criticism and comparison with other singers is not necessary since each person is different.
B00003CXB2|5.0|After viewing Lawrence of Arabia, I am not quite sure how I feel about it. Don't get me wrong, the movie riveted me from start to finish. I think it was said best by Steven Spielberg in an interview contained on the DVD. He said that when he saw the movie as a teenager, he left the theater stunned and speechless. He said it just sat on his mind for weeks, and he wasn't quite sure what to do with it. I echo those sentiments. I believe the reason for this is that Lean leaves many clues as to Lawrence's character, but in the end, his motivations are open to interpretation. Here's mine: Lawrence, as portrayed by Lean, is a megalomaniacal adrenaline-junkie who is frightened only by the implications of becoming one. In other words, Lawrence knows his nature all too well, and doesn't want to succumb to it, but in the end, is helpless. Here's some evidence: <br /> <br />1) Lawrence dies at the beginning of the movie riding a motorcycle at excessive speeds. <br />2) When Lawrence is asked by his army-mate how he put the match out with his fingers, he says the key is \\"not minding\\" the pain. <br />3) Lawrence, on his return-trip to Cairo, informs Allenby about the two people he had killed and that he \\"liked\\" it. This following his insistence that he did not want to go back to Arabia; but once Allenby appeals to his \\"ability,\\" Lawrence swallows the bait and looks excited to return and does so. <br />4) The unjustifiable folly/suicide mission to infiltrate the Turkish outpost with only Ali. <br />5) His apparent love of having his picture taken by the American photographer accompanying his army. <br />6) When he is shot in the arm by the dying Turkish soldier after the successful train-raid, his incredulous look screams genuine surprise. It's as if he couldn't believe that anyone could shoot him in his infinite hubris. <br />7) The bloodlust he displays during the Arab massacre of the fleeing Turkish army near Damascus. <br /> <br />There are many more such episodes that helps one decipher the enigma that is Lean's Lawrence. One of my favorite episodes was the existential subplot concerning \\"what is written.\\" After Lawrence and his fifty Arabs traversed the dangerous desert on their way to Aqaba, he noticed that he had lost a man who had fallen off his camel. Ali insisted to Lawrence that the man's death \\"was written,\\" and attempted to keep Lawrence from going back for him. Lawrence goes anyway, and is successful in bringing the man out of the desert alive. The first thing he says to Ali is that \\"nothing is written.\\" Who are we to argue at this point? But later, when the same man is accused of stealing from a rival tribesman, Lawrence is forced to shoot him to avert a feud among the tribes he is trying to unite. It was priceless when Anthony Quinn's character bookends the episode after hearing this story with a confident \\"it was written, then.\\" Absolutely wonderful storytelling! Also, when Lawrence is captured by the Turks, Lean does an excellent job showing the atrophy of the Ottoman Empire. The Commander seems weary and fatalistic. He even remarks how he had been rotting in this outpost for so many years.  <br /> <br />The images so many of us have of WWI lie along the Western Front in France and Belgium. Very few realize that the entire world was under at war as well. Truly, this is one of the greatest movies of all time!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|The best thing about Saw is its premise. But if you're looking for Saw to be something beyond simply a creepy idea, you'll probably be disappointed. <br /> <br />The performances turned in by both lead actors are downright bad. Leigh Wannell, who co-wrote the script, should probably stick to writing as he fails to bring any real life to his character. Cary Elwes, who's been enjoyable when cast in lighter fare just can't pull off the level of emotion needed. His cries of \\"Allie? Allie!?\\" should be gut wrenching. Well, they are, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br />The film's twist ending is...well, interesting. It could have been good had it been written better, but as it is, it adds a huge number of holes to the plot. That said, if you're the kind of person who likes to shut off their brain entirely when watching a movie, you probably won't be troubled.  <br /> <br />One positive about the movie is the competent direction of James Wan, who shows that he knows a thing or two about atmospherics. It's largely because of him that the film still engaged me with its creepiness, even when the wretched acting made me want to give up. <br /> <br />Overall: Creepy, but crippled by bad acting and gaps in plotting.

0451196716|4.0|When most people hear stephen King's name, they expect big monsters and lots of gore.<br /><br />Not in this case, unless you can see some of the worst off traits of the human race as a mnostrosity.<br /><br />In this book, we are introduced to an alternate reality. Nothing is very clear, but apparentlu the US is under military rule, under the Major. Every year, 100 boys go on something which is called the Long Walk. They boys just have to walk from Maine south, at a speed of 4 miles an hour. Anyone walking slower, in the wrong direction, or just happens to stop too long for whatever reason (legitimate as it may be) - gets a warning. After 3 warnings - he dies. If he manages to walk for an hour without being warned again - a warning is taken off. The last boy left walking is the winner, and the prize is - anything he wants. Every year, crowds gather to watch the boys walking.<br /><br />But as the walk progresses, and the boys realize most of them would not survive and the next person killed might be you - the attraction of the walk is quickly wearing off, and the horror of exhersion or death is growing.

B0007O38F8|5.0|Wow im suprised for two reasons. Number one - This album is great. Number two - all the haters out there. You gotta be a real 50 hater to give this album a one. I admit theres a couple garbage tracks on it, but which album doesnt at least a couple bad tracks on it? Also 50 is tryin to be more serious then on Get Rich. The almbums have two completely different themes (Get Rich.., The Massacre - Duh) so dont expect the same thing. Besides we already got those hits why not sumthin a lil different? And for all those people who are making their decision about buying the album off these reviews, trust me if u love 50 ull love this album. And if u love Fat joe, Nas, Ja Rule etc. maybe u wont cause fiddy disses em bad.
7119005901|5.0|First of all, this is a classic of Chinese that is relatively unknown in the west.  This epic could be considered the Shakespeare of the Chinese language.  It depicts the decay and collapse of the Han dynasty.  In the process of this decay, the nation is split into three kingdoms which stuggle for supremacy.  In the process of this struggle, we find tales of friendship, heroism, betrayal, and tragedy.  This novel has thousands of characters, but perhaps the main character is Kongming, the military strategist of one of the kingdoms.  It's a pure pleasure to read his elegantly executed strategies.<br /><br />This translation has a modern feel, so it was easier to read than other translations that I have read.  Robert Moss does a good job of making the story flow.  However, as some other reviewers have said, it doesn't have a poetic feel.  While the story has been translated, it is always difficult to translate literature into other languages.  Having said that, I think this is an excellent translation for those who want an easy read or those who are reading Three Kingdoms for the first time.  Also I strongly recommend an unabridged version, such as this one.  If you read an abridged version, the story won't seem well developed.  The full text is necessary.  I especially recommend this novel for those who are studying politics, military science, or business.  You'll learn lots of strategies for living life.
0790729377|2.0|I won't go into how amazing this movie is. We all know that. What gets me is how little respect Warner Bros. pays to the classic films that built their studios. Here you have one of the best films of all time and they release it on a DVD with virtually no extras and a VERY sub-par transfer. From the moment the Warner Bros. logo pops up you can see how unstable the image is...not to mention a large amount of dirt and debris running through every scene. The sound quality isn't much better (I actually had to turn the subtitles on for some of the pivotal scenes).Isn't this film worthy of a restoration? I've run across this same problem a lot with this company's releases. I guess they know that people will buy these wonderful movies based on the reviews of the movies themselves and don't feel any need to fork out cash to ensure the quality of their products.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is the first review I ever bothered to write.  Why? Because it is the best album I bought in the past 5 years.   <br /> <br />If Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin were around today, decided to form one group, then took the strengths of each and made a record, the result would be Mars Volta - Frances the Mute. That is truly some great company to be in. <br /> <br />As I have noticed on this site, most people either hate or love this band.  I'm in the category of people who love this band because I really appreciate what they do.  They are truly great musicians.  They could easily make more commercial and radio friendly music but choose to go the road less traveled.  Fine with me.  <br /> <br />I have also noticed from people who love Mars Volta - either love Deloused and hate Frances or vice versa.  Both albums are extraordinary but to me, Frances is a bit better and more cohesive.  I know this album is considered a bit more prog than their previous effort and that in a sense, would suggest otherwise.  But not true.  Deloused has a lot of great great moments but then there are other moments that seem really out of place.  Some songs go on into a world of noise for a while with little direction.  Probably the creator's intention but it seemed to drag some songs down.  This album has the same strengths but not as much of the same flaws.  Only flaw in my opinion is at the end of \\"the widow,\\" which seems a bit unnecessary.  Other than that, to me, this album is perfect.
B000002C1W|5.0|I was first introduced to Pink Floyd right about the time this album came out. So while I was discovering the wall, dark side, and meddle for the first time, I was also discovering AMLOR. There is something special about this album for me that is hard to put into words. Perhaps its the atmospheric-ness of Signs of Life, or the grove in Learning to Fly, and the jam in Sorrow, this album just has it all for me. When I listen to this recording, I hear a group of musicians that were over the whole Waters feud that were ready to make music again, the music that they wanted to write and play. That said, Pink Floyd had nothing to prove at this point except for the fact that Gilmour and company wanted to continue making good music, because thats what they love to do.  <br /> <br />The guitar work especially shines here, the solos are all bluesy, filled with feeling and lyricism. You could sing to these solos as you would expect from Gilmour. And there is enough creativity on this album to make it different yet the same from other Floyd albums. How Pink Floyd did that is what the magic of AMLOR is all about.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|As a Priest fan from the beginning (Rocka Rolla, Sad Wings, Sin After Sin)I can honestly say this album is a fine effort. Far better than their last attempt, Painkiller. My only problem with this album is that I had become spoiled with Halford's last solo effort Cruclible, which more than a few experts believe to be the finest metal album ever recorded.  <br />As nice an effort as Angel of Retribution is, I would have been content with Judas Priest's body of work (sans the Ripper Owens era). That having been said, the guitar virtuosity of Tipton & Downing have markedly improved - unusual in the heavy metal world. Scott Travis is superior to any drummer Priest has ever employed. And how does Rob Halford do it? There are some notes he doesn't attempt to hit live, but he more than comensates. <br />I was dissappointed by the documentary, but couldn't help laughing myself silly as I compared it in my mind to the band interview segments from \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\". Go out and buy this package and have as much fun as I'm having!
B0007TKNIS|4.0|I have a theatre and singing background, and I have many theatre friends who, basically, \\"snub\\" Andrew Lloyd Weber and his music.  Okay, the guy does, shall we say, \\"borrow\\" many bits of music from some of the great composers - you can hear many Verdi and Puccini bits in any of his shows.  But give the man his due - the music does set a mood, is memorable, and a joy to listen to.  This is very true to the setting of the new movie.  It is beautifully done - costume/sets/etc., visually very impressive, and something worth savoring on a DVD to watch again and again.  My only real negative comment is that the gentleman chosen as the Phantom did not live up to my expectations.  He simply was too \\"pretty\\" for the part, should have been older, and needed a more compelling voice.  Having heard Michael Crawford in the original stage role, this Phantom's voice was too rough and uninspiring.  I thing the other roles were cast very well, and sung equally committed.  I recommend the experience.
B00027JYLC|5.0|This film was banned for a while for exploiting the people involved, the freaks of the sideshows of the 1930's.  This is a very entertaining film with real people, the only people wearing make-up are the clown and Josephine-Joseph Half-woman/Half-man.  There are a variety of people, Daisy and  <br />Violet Hilton-the Siamese Twins, Hans and Frieda-brother and sister in real life from the Doll family.  Schlitzie, Elvira and her sister(?)-the pinheads.  The armless women.  Johnny Eck, the Half-man.  Plus others that will amaze you.  I have this film in many versions.  If you are interested in the way the circus life was in the 1930's then you should get this film. <br />I suggest the DVD because it has more than just the movie, it has interesting history about the people once called freaks, whereas the video is just the movie.  It is in black and white, well worth the money.
B00005JMAH|3.0|While still nowhere near as good as the books, Prisoner of Azkaban fared the best of the first 3 Potter books in its transition to the silver screen. It had some problems, but overall, it was enjoyable. <br /> <br />First, the good stuff: David Thewlis was perfect as Professor Lupin. His down-on-his-luck, yet noble portrayal, with just the right air of mystery, worked beautifully, the equal of the always good Alan Rickman as Snape. Michael Gambon was also a big improvement over Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson clearly had fun as the daffy Professor Trelawney. <br /> <br />The kids were generally well done in the way they were shown transitioning through adolescence here, and the gist of the plot - the hunt for escaped convict Sirius Black - held the right air of menace. The special fx were decent if not great. (The dementors, for example, were scary, but couldn't help but bring to mind, and suffer in comparison with, the ring wraiths from Lord of the Rings.) <br /> <br />Moreover, what all too many reviewers fail to understand is that a book and a movie are different media for telling a story. I expect a film adaptation of a book to capture the spirit of the book, not necessarily to regurgitate every plot point and line of dialogue verbatim. The first two Potter movies faithfully repeated many (not all) of the stuff from the books, but it was stuff seemingly chosen at random. The result was that those movies felt disjointed, incoherant, and not at all like Harry Potter. <br /> <br />Prisoner at least tries to be its own film, and as a result, it stays truer to the source, and ends up being a much better story. <br /> <br />But there was some bad stuff: Draco Malfoy grew even more ludicrous, he was so pathetically whiny that it was hard to see him as threatening in any way. (In fairness, that's a problem that's growing in the books, too.) The actor who played Wormtail was just off - rather than craven, he came off as weaselly and silly. The complex plot of the book was hard to get across, and the movie only partly succeeds. There are definitely holes that will leave you scratching your head if you haven't read the books. <br /> <br />The true HP fanatic will probably want to buy this movie, especially to tide you over until book 6 this summer.
0451529308|5.0|As I began the first chapter of this book, I thought I had made a mistake in purchaing it. It started off kind of \\"goody-goody\\" sounding and written for young adults. But I gave it a chance, and it paid off. As I got further into the book, I was hooked. I fell in love with the characters and kept turning the page to see what would happen next. It's a classic story for every woman. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my 8-year-old cousin.    The story is essentially about 4 sisters as they grow up. Each sister is unique, with different ideas and priorities. \\"Watching\\" them grow up through out the book is entertaining and heart-warming.
B0007TKH66|4.0|I am a Star Trek fan and have seen and enjoyed every Star Trek series. My favorite Treks are The Original Series, Deep Space Nine and Enterprise. I would describe the first season of Enterprise as \\"hit and miss,\\" just like I would the first season of every other Star Trek. I always felt that it wonderfully expanded on the universe seen in TOS, TNG and DS9 (This is where Voyager failed). The season features several good episodes, several mediocre, and a few bad. Yes, there are several shows (Oasis, Rogue Planet) that did not need to be done and at times, characters are underdeveloped in this season. I still believe the good outweighs the bad. <br /> <br />I am possibly one the few fans in the world who found the Temporal Cold War an interesting storyline. I never felt it overshadowed the \\"prequel\\" elements of the series. I enjoyed how it only surfaced occasionaly in the first two seasons and led to very exciting events in the third. The complaints of violation of canon I felt uncalled for, since most of the complaints delt with violations to fanon, or fiction that fans wrote to fill holes in the Trek universe. Canon was the Trek seen on screen and I felt Enterprise  did a fine job adhering to it, with a few exceptions such as the use of plasma weapons (See Voy's \\"Flashback\\"). Fans were happy with their perceptions of Trek and did not like their perceptions challanged. The portrayal of the Vulcans is a prime example of this, but this is not the forum to debate this topic. <br /> <br />This season also featured many prequel elements such as Andorians (Andorian Incident, Shadows of P'Jem), human colonies (Terra Nova) and the ineffectual weapons (Fight or Flight, Silent Enemy). This season does an great job laying the goundwork for the series. Overall, a good start to the show, at times slow and at times exciting. The second season fails to build on the momentum gathered in the first, but the show really takes off in the third and fourth seasons. It is unfortunate that the show was cancelled with so many stories left untold.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Plenty has been said about this album, and I cannot speak from anyone else's point of view, but there are very very few albums that I am able to listen to a great deal a month after buying them. This album is an exception. It is beautiful from beginning to end. It was beautiful the first time I listtened to it, it has become sublime and powerful over continued listening to it; I'm in awe of what these musicians have done. Comparable to what Sufjan Stevens has done for me musically. Give this album a chance. If you don't like it the first time, listen to it two more times, if you aren't beginning to love the music... well I can only speak for my own experience, it is the best album of the year.
B00005R62K|3.0|This album, like the one before it (Sin After Sin), suffers from lackluster production values.  While this album has greatly improved in the low end, it seems the guitars are thinner than ever and largely buried in the mix.<br /><br />Another disappointment with this release is that the music is largely forgettable.  There are a couple stand-out tracks, namely \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" (one of their all-time greats), and the curious cover, \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" (written by Gary Wright of \\"Dreamweaver\\" fame), but the rest don't seem very focused and don't stick with you after the music ends.  This will not be the case with their next release.<br /><br />This album introduces a new drummer to the fold (Les Binks), but his tenure with the band will not last long.  Too bad, too, because his style of play complemented the band better than any other drummer to sit with the band.<br /><br />If you are a casual fan, this would not be the first album to pick up.
0316172324|5.0|Well he is clearly a liberal, and it makes sense considering who he is.   Just the same his book is wonderfully written, and thoroughly refernced.   I have seldom seen a more logical and thorough writing, or one more readily readable and packed with interetsing as well as useful information.   I couldn't recommend this work highly enough.
B00006V9A0|2.0|Let's get our facts straight here.  Nirvana had ONE good album to their credit.  Yes, \\"Nevermind\\" was an outstanding album.  One of the best in the history of rock.  There's no doubting that.  However, can a band build a legacy off of one album?  Apparently so.  Nirvana is the most overrated band in the history of music.<br /><br />Nirvana has several studio releases under their belt; \\"Bleach\\" which is no better than something from your average local garage band.  Then you have \\"Insecticide\\", which was their first compilation of B-Sides, Rarities, and songs that have no business being on any album.  Again, another very weak release.  Then we have \\"In Utero\\", which was one of the most anticipated follow up albums ever known in music, but it failed to deliver in any way.  If you think about it, \\"In Utero\\" really only has 3 or 4 songs even worth listening to.  How many made this album?  2 or 3?  \\"Unplugged in New York\\" was a nice addition to the collection.  Excellent arrangement of a number of their songs.  It was mostly old material, but they threw some covers in for good measure.  Last but not least, \\"Nevermind\\".  No doubt, unreal album.  Most of Nirvana's hits, and their legacy came from this album, and this album alone.<br /><br />What I would suggest for a Nirvana's Greatest Hits album would be for someone to buy \\"Nevermind\\", and download about 5 songs or so from the internet.  There you go... you have everything good Nirvana ever did.
B000002URV|5.0|I recollect at the age of thirteen,seeing the music video for \\"Sadeness Part 1\\" and I was positively enthralled with not only the fantastical images,but the unfathomably ethereal music! It was like nothing that I'd ever seen or heard hitherto! Suffice it to say,shortly thereafter,I hurried out to buy this album.I initially listened to its exquisite inotations upon the Walkman stereo that I had had at the time.This was before I was to sleep for the night.From enchantingly enticing beginning to graciously glorious end,I was in a state of rapture.I listened to it, in all its awesome entirety two more times that night,before finally falling to sleep.Inspiring,highly erotic,and ultimately,utterly transcendant--it is a true masterpiece!What I especially love about this album is that it comes \\"full circle\\"--(if you will).My favorite song ,above all songs ,by ANY artist, is still--\\"Back to the Rivers of Belief\\"--in its complete sequence.I am twenty-seven now and this is still my favourite music(and I humbly thank Michael Cretu for being the mastermind behind such innovative brilliance!)--and my favourite album.I am still exceptionally fond of each album that has been released by Enigma since--but this one resonates with my soul--the most!The moon,the stars,lofty mountains,the sea--ancient cathedrals,monks in their signature hooded robes,beautiful men and women in sensual episodes,falling rain,horses and carriages,swords,courageous warriors and honourable kings,the images for me continue ever on...Utopia...

0060207051|5.0|Goodnight Moon was one of my favorite books when I was young, and now I have the privelege of reading this book to my own children. With it's simple, yet myseterious-looking pictures, and it's rather intriguing repetition, what's not to love? It's one of those books that never gets old. I've had my copy since 1987 and it has never collected dust. It's a favorite of my children now, and has almost become a \\"comfort\\" story for them. I reccommend this book to everyone, adults and children alike.
B000001FDK|4.0|I'll start by saying I love this movie.  I've seen it many times and will see it many more time in the future.  Unfortunately, I find the album to be a collection of some great songs and a lot of incidental music that doesn't make for an entirely pleasurable listening experience.<br /><br />The biggest gripe I have is that after all these years, they STILL haven't corrected the running order of the songs.  \\"You're the One That I Want\\" was not the 4th song in the movie; it was one of the last performed.  How could they get this wrong and, worse yet, how could they have not corrected this?<br /><br />Songs/Incidental music that could have been omitted:<br />-Beauty School Drop Out<br />-Sha Na Na songs (I like Sha Na Na, I just don't think they needed to include them on the sound track)<br />-Likewise the Cindy Bullens and Louis St. Louis songs.  The album would have been just fine without these songs.<br /><br />I think the album could have been much more focused and enjoyable had they included only those songs performed by the characters in the movie (Olivia Newton John, John Travolta, Stockard Channing, et al).  I think their performances are incredible and really make the movie what it is/was.  The rest is just filler.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|The acting was great by all actors involved. You felt that the actors were really the characters they were playing as supposed to \\"Hey look, it's Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.\\" The story was well written and well executed. The best thing was that it was believable, there was no matrix moves, no superhero antics, no special effects to make up for poor acting. The only draw back is that the ending was predictable. I agree with the critics however, they dont make movies like this anymore.<br /><br />There were some 'laugh out loud' scenes that brought some comic relief throughout the movie, my favorite being the cab radio dialogue between Max, Max's boss, and Vincent, after Max's taxi sustained some windshield damage. Also enjoyed the soundtrack. This is a definite must see.
B0006399FS|1.0|I'm in agreement with several posters who said this album is \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" Part 2.  I thought I was alone, in seeing right through that album, as nothing more than a fake, poppy, manufactured sound that was tired and dull.  Well, U2 did it again, folks.<br /><br />You can't get much manufactured than this.  It almost sounds as if the guys made this album, just to get some songs on radio, and to make some more money.  There's no feeling behind any of these songs, and they're getting to be a tired, tired act.<br /><br />Bono is nominated for another Nobel Peace Prize.  Impressive.  However, I'm not impressed with the fact that it seems he also thinks that he's saving the music industry through U2's music.  Fat chance.  U2 is washed up, and I hope this is it.  They WERE a great band, but when you start putting out forced, heartless albums such as this, time to do something else.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This is an amazing album; I bought the original Chariot album on a whim.  I dont know why, I just had to have it.  It turned out to be worth every cent.  When I heard the live version, I decided to reinvest.  The stripped CD is even more remarkable than the first, it showcases his raw talent.  Of all the CDs I own this is the one that rarely ever leaves the player.  Its one of those rare albums that you can listen to from start to finish without ever feeling the need to skip a track.  Buy this album!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Angel Of Retribution is Judas Priest's first album with Rob Halford in like ten or more years, not to mention there best in almost fifteen maybe twenty years. The classic line up is back and boy are they at teh top of their game.<br /><br />The album opens up with it's best track, 'Judas Rising' this heavy hitter contains one of Glen and K.K.'s best guitar riffs, not to mention solo's. Helford's vocals sound amazing as always. Scott Travis' use of the double kick drum is awesome, and unlike another reviewer said, it's not over done it adds an awesome feel to the song. Next up is the killer 'Deal With The Devil' which has killer leads by Tipton and a great chorus by Halford. Classic Priest! 'Revolution' is the first single of the album, and it's not getting very much radio play. I think I'ev only heard it once on the radio really, which sucks because it's one of Priest all time best songs in my opinion. Awesome lyrics and delivery from Halford. The guitar riffs on this song are some of the best that Glen and K.K. have ever created, and the solo is really cool, the use of the wha-wha pedal is really cool as well. 'Worth Fighting For' starts of with a nice drum groove and leads into arpegiated guiar chords that sound really cool. This song has Hills all time best bass line! But the one thing that threw me about this song is when Halford begins to sing it doesnt sound like him at first but then it turns into classic Rob, and I love it! The Next song is the hardest and heaviest track on the album. 'Demonizer' once again has Travis' double kick drum which adds a nice touch. The guitar riffs on Demonizer reminded me why K.K. and Glen are such amazing guitar players, this almost sounds like something Killswitch Engage or Lamb Of God would create just without Robs killer vocals. 'Wheels Of Fire' is classic Judas Priest, sounds like something the could have written in the 80's. Would have fit in nicely on Painkiller(which is a very underrated album!). 'Angel' is a nice ballad. Or maybe it's not a ballad. I dont know what to call it. I just know it has great acoustic guitar by the boys and some of Halfords best lyrics. It doesnt really stand out though. After Angel we go right back into heavy metal. 'Hellrider' starts out with a guitar intro by Tipton that sounds pretty cool. Halfords delivery of the vocals on Hellrider sounds so cool! This song is so awesome I dont really know what to say about it. It goes from Halfords signature scream to his low growl all in one lyric and it's just an amazing song! 'Eulogy' is another slower song with acoustic guitars, but this time it has piano. This song doesnt have as good of lyrics as Angel but over all I would say Eulogy is better. The album comes to an end with 'Lochness' which was the perfect song to end the album. The song starts out slow but gains force and turns in to the heaviest song that Priest has ever recorded, truly and awesome ending to a killer album!<br /><br />As far as the dvd goes all I have to say is it's icing on the cake. The dvd has a documentary about the band on tour in the summer of 2004 and it also talks about the recording of Angel Of Retribution. Some people said they didnt like the documentary because it talks over some of the performances, but thats stupid because if you want you can just watch the performances with out the interuption of the documentary, so there is no reason why you shouldn't love the dvd. The performances include 'Breaking The Law' 'Metal Gods' 'A Touch Of Evil' 'Hell Bent For Leather' 'The Hellion/Electric Eye' 'Dimonds & Rust' and 'Living After Midnight' and all of which are fantastic.<br /><br />Being the METAL GODS that they are Judas Priest created the best metal album of the last ten years with Angel Of Retribution. So far Angel Of Retribution is the best album of 2005. I highly recomend this album to any fan of Judas Priest, classic metal, modern metal, power metal, or just all around hard rock because this is truly one of the best albums Ihave ever bought, so do yourself a favor an get Angel of Retribution!yourself a favor an get Angel of Retribution!
0385512058|5.0|I'm a naturally shy person and I've always hated the concept of \\"networking.\\"  Everyone I know that practices it in the commonly accepted sense is a complete jerk.  This book, however, addresses the true power behind networking; building actual relationships.  I would probably give the book 4.5 stars, since too much of it is devoted to name dropping, but this small flaw does not detract from the value of the book.  Mr. Ferrazzi takes the approach of building meaningful relationships with others, even when time is short.  He doesn't advocate carpet bombing a room with your business cards or hanging out with people you despise as a means of getting ahead.  I appreciate the fact that the author came from humble beginnings and was able to reach such heights in the world of business.  There are several practical approaches that are discussed in this book that can be of help to both extroverts and the relatively introverted.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm amazed that somehow the band have managed to come up with an album that easily matches Hybrid Theory and Reanimation in its raw power. Considering they had 2 years to make it, compared to 10+ years for the first album, its a pretty good effort. I don't really have a favourite as every Linkin Park song bears the same trademark skill of production, lyrical perfection and sonic power. The amazing thing is, there is NO filler. I just hope their next artist album is a bit heavier, as Meteora is alot softer than Hybrid, the sound I fell in love with first. Linkin Park have proven their talent with the release of Meteora.
B0007O38F8|5.0|...........I thought it was terrible the first time I heard it and now Im beginning to think \\"the massacre\\" is even better than GRODT..........You gotta feel the beat out, listen to it more than once and I guarantee half of the people reviewing this CD a 1 will give anything to change their rating to 5.......i cant stop listening to this cd, its maddddddddd hotttttttttttttt
B0007O38F8|5.0|First Off, If you compare this album to \\"get Rich Or Die Tryin\\", You a ediot! You cant top a classic stupid 2 Pac couldnt do it, Jay-Z couldnt do It, Nas Couldnt do it, & No otha rapper out now or in history, Aint nothin impossible, but thats highly, highly Rare. Who ever rated this cd low for one didnt listen to it, they wasnt a fan from jump, or tryin to compare this album to A Classic album (Get Rich Or Die Tryin) which mean to me  that they STUPID. It's as simple as this listen to it like its his first album, and if you still dont like it then you just a HAAAAATEEERRRR!!!!!

0761129235|5.0|I read a good deal of self improvement literature and this work is one of the best.  If you've tried dozens of New Year's Resolutions that have failed, or if you just can't make headway in living a healthy lifestyle, this book can provide you with an alternative approach that isn't about positive thinking or affirmations.  The Science of Small Steps is a system that fools your brain into forgetting the fear of failure and other self-sabotaging tendencies that hijack your efforts.  I've used the system to help me make progress in business and on the personal front.  I've been able to develop positive habits like regular exercise and flossing my teeth by utilizing this system.  The book is well-organized, easy to read and interesting.
B0001I55OC|3.0|It's a familiar story for SF readers, though maybe less so for movie watchers: Our Hero[es] go back in time and muck up some linchpin historical event. History knows where it's going, and makes sure things turn out the way they did anyway. For movie purposes, the good guys (or most of them) win and the bad guy suffers the fate he had planned for them.<br /><br />The nominal story is that The Professor - Uncle Monty from Lemony Snicket - is an archaeologist, and has hooked up with The Corporation. The time travel thingy can only contact one place and time, oddly enough, the site of his research dig back when it was still current events. (Why is is that time machines can only go to interesting places?) The Prof gets stuck way back when, and The Corp convinces his students to go back after him. The Corp omits a few details, like people occasionally coming back in pieces, and sends them back to collect The Prof. That, of course, is where the fun starts.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is all running around in itchy clothes, trying to hide from both the English and the French as the coming battle looms, and seeing what their archaeological ruins looked like before they were ruined. A technical malfunction (a hand grenade in the time machine) gums things up a bit, but we needed some reason to prolong the voyage. The female characters are good, certainly not the \\"save me\\" sort. The male characters are somewhat standard, including a father and son reconciliation in the offing and a few auxiliaries with short life expectancies. In other words, nothing to strain the intellect.<br /><br />This is acceptable amusement, with lots of great flaming stuff in the medieval night battle. It's only ordinary, but ordinary isn't all that bad.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00006CXXU|4.0|This album has excellent songs! Walk away, infatuation, i'm ok and beautiful, it has very deep letters, but she shouts too much, abuses her voice, in ocaciones tires
B000025XKM|5.0|I must admit that I only bought this cd because I heard the song in the Volkswagen commercial. Coincidentially I also purchased a Volkswagen around the same time. The cd turned out to have a really good title track which I just put on repeat, and skip the rest while I'm driving. I'm sure the rest of it is probably good modern folk along the lined of John Mayer or Ryan Adams or whatever, but let's face it: I, like many others just want to hear the song he made for the commercial anyways. This Nick Drake seems like too much of a guy that just makes songs for commercials, and that is how he's getting famous. I do really like his new song he did for the Oreo Cookies commercial, and am currently looking to find out which cd it's on (help me if you know). I am only giving Pink Moon a 5 star review since it helped me decide to get the volkswagen, and have had little to no problems with the car, unless you count replacing the wipers, and a flat tire once, but that could happen to anybody. In conclusion the car has made me very happy. The cd is an okay buy if you don't mind supporting a guy that seems to write song exclusively to sell products in commercials. Actually if I'm not mistaken I think he might have done a song called Mellow yellow for a gap commercial a few years ago (can anyone confirm?). Nice career, guy. Later.     howardtuttleman.com
B000002JPA|5.0|\\"Images and Words\\" was my first Dream Theater album. At first I thought it was complete garbage and that Dream Theater was WAY overrrated and WAY overhyped. At first listen I really only liked the songs \\"Pull Me Under\\", \\"Another Day\\", and \\"Learning to Live\\". \\"Another Day\\" being my favorite of the three songs. I actually thought that everyone's favorite \\"Metroplois\\" was the worst song on the album. I thought the middle instrumental section was just annoying, especially those keyboards at most points.  <br /> <br />But then I started listening to each song a little more each day. I found myself enjoying litle bits and pieces of each song more and more everyday. Before I even knew it I thought \\"Take the Time\\" was a brilliant song and I could now listen to the instrumental section of \\"Metropolis\\" without cringing. <br /> <br />So, I then went out and bought \\"Awake\\". Now, \\"Awake\\" was a dream Theater album that I liked from my very first listen, unlike \\"Images and Words\\". The songs that stood out to me at first were \\"6:00\\", \\"Innocence Faded\\", and \\"Lie\\". Out of those three I'd say that I liked \\"Innocence Faded\\" the best. I kinda thought that it was similar to \\"Another Day\\" in song structure and through it's catchiness.  <br /> <br />So, then I went on to the DT forums and read that like everybody thought that both \\"Another Day\\" and \\"Innocence Faded\\" were two of the worst two on both albums combined. I was like-\\"What???? That can't be right?\\".  <br /> <br />Then I went back and listen to some more of \\"Images and Words\\". I listened to it non-stop for about a month and my opinions had changed drastically. \\"Another Day\\", \\"Surrounded\\", and \\"Wait for Sleep\\" were now my three leat favorite songs from that album. All of a sudden, \\"Under a Glass Moon\\" and \\"Pull Me Under\\" were two solid awesome songs. And finally I thought that \\"Take the Time\\", \\"Learning to Live\\" and YES \\"Metropolis\\" were the three best songs on the album, all three being timeless classics. <br /> <br />Point being?<br /> <br />Give it time, it will grow on you. It sure worked for me.

B000002UAR|5.0|It is in the opinion of this reviewer, that Revolver is the Fab Four's best recorded album.  Even more of a joy than Sgt. Pepper.    Unlike Pepper, practically every song on Revolver is a gem.  From \\"Taxman\\" to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" it's hit after hit of the greatest in pop, psychedelia, and rock 'n roll.    It is with Revolver, that the writing styles of Lennon and McCartney started to become more distinct.  John's tunes have a psychedelic acid-trip vibe (I'm Only Sleeping, She Said She Said, Tomorrow Never Knows).  Paul seems to favor the classic pop song and ballad (Here, There and Everywhere; For No One).  Of course, these differences in writing and composition would eventually lead to the end of the band, but here the two Liverpuddies shine.    An even greater joy is the continuing evolution of George Harrison's songwriting.  Though he only has three songs on the album, they are some of the best from the band's mid-60s era.  \\"Taxman\\" is a classic with a wonderfully Indian-influenced guitar solo by Paul.  \\"Love You To\\" is, easily, George's best foray into Indian music.    But the single best song on the album is the last one.  What can I say about \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" that hasn't been already said...?  It is the most psychedelic song written by the Four; John purposefully wanted it to be an acid-trip set to music.    Though Sgt. Pepper is hailed by many, it is my opinion that Revolver is the best album by the greatest band of the 20th Century.  The songs are all eclectic and vary in style and composition.  This is a classic pop/rock 'n roll album.  Simply a must-own for anyone who considers themselves a fan of pop music.
0765309408|5.0|I first read Robert A. Heinlein more than 50 years ago.  If you had told me this was an undiscovered Heinlein manuscript from his best years, updated by a modern editor, I would have believed it.  I can give a science fiction book no higher praise.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|\\"Brave New World\\" by Iron Maiden is probably the best comeback album of all time. After Blaze left the band, he was replaced by the retuning almighty Bruce Dickinson! Former Maiden guitarist(Killers-Seventh Son of a Seventh Son) was also added back onto the mix, and they were ready to rock out again! <br /> <br />\\"The Wickerman\\" starts off this album with a bang. Out of all of the songs on the album there was no better song that could open an album than this song. Awesome song, very powerful. You gotta love the chorus. In my opinion it isn't up there with \\"Prowler\\", \\"Aces High\\", \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\", or \\"Moonchild\\",  as a Maiden opener, but all of those songs are classics.  <br /> <br />Then comes the \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\" and it's one of my favoriute songs on the album. Great inrto, I've always loved it. It has some great lyrics too-\\"Take my Heart and set it free. Carried onwrd towards the waves\\". Great song. <br /> <br />Then comes the title track \\"Brave New World\\". This is another one of my favorite songs on the album. It's actually very emotional. \\"Dying Swans, Twisted Wings. Beauty not needed here.\\" I love that line. I especially love the way Bruce sings it. Great song, one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Then there is another highlight of the album \\"Blood Brothers\\". It has some more great lyrics and more great singing from Bruce. \\"When you think that we've used all our chances. And the chance to make everything right, Keep on making the same old mistakes.\\" Those lines plus what comes after it is really great, in my opinion. Another awesome song here. <br /> <br />Then we hit a speed bump. \\"The Mercenary\\" is next and it is fun for about a minute. Then it becomes old...and old fast. Not the best song on here, so I'll move onto the next one. <br /> <br />\\"Dream of Mirrors\\" makes up for what \\"The Mercenary\\" wasn't. It has great guitar lines all throughout the song. It may seem repetitive at some points, but it's still a great song. <br /> <br />Then comes \\"The Fallen Angel\\". It's a bit annoying, not a favorite of mine. It isn't very memorable at all, but it has some good parts, so we'll move on to.... <br /> <br />\\"The Nomad\\". Awesome song here, another one of my favorites from the album. It's got some cool lyrics, and some awesome singing from Bruce. But, my favorite part of the song is that long awesome interlude. It's just pure greatness. <br /> <br />Then comes \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\". I was never a fan of this song, and I can't say that I listen to it a lot, so we'll move onto the final song on the album... <br /> <br />\\"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate. This song is SEVERELY underrated. This used to be one of my favorite Maidne songs. It isn't anymore, but I still acknowledge it's awesomeness. Bruce has his best vocal performance from this album on this song, in my opinion. Great song, listen to it. <br /> <br /> <br />Favorite 5 songs: <br /> <br />Ghost of the Navigator <br />Brave New World <br />Blood Brothers <br />The Nomad <br />The Thin Line Between Love and Hate <br /> <br />\\"Brave New World\\" is a great album. I like what Iron Maidne did here. They didn't try to remake \\"Powerslave\\". They went in a completely different direction and it was a success. <br /> <br />The Legends Live On
076790592X|2.0|If you need yet another reminder that you must seize every moment of life to the fullest, then this book might have a transformational, albeit temporary, impact on you.  Otherwise, it is yet another person's opinion regarding what a life worth living should be like.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I think this has the potential to become a classic. To be known 50 to 100 years from now. I think Johhny Depp was abetter choice than Marilyn Manson. Yes, MM was a choice. That is no rumor. I believe choosing Johhny was better because think about it,if MM got the job, parents would be like, \\"that satanic monster is going to try and send subliminal messages through the movie and get our kids to hate god and worship satan,\\" or something like that. With Johhny, at least they could say,\\"He was in that great Disney film, Pirates of the Caribbean.\\" and robin williams? come on people, he is good and probably the best comedian actor there  is, but he would not have made a good willy wonka. In my opinion.  And take notice, the book was called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Not Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Im not saying Gene Wilder's version wasnt bad but they should atleast kept the name the same.  <br />P.S- With Johhny Depp and Tim Burton, this isgoin to be a masterpieace, or at least it should be.
0312263120|2.0|As probably many other readers I was reading Dan Brown books backwards - starting from 'Da Vinci Code' to 'Angels and Demons' and now to this one. And every book amplifies more and more the characteristics of Dan Brown' writing, which is interesting subject, interesting plot, lack of any characters development and wooden writing. I would say that this book has all this with the two latter qualities taken to the extreme. It's so badly written that I fought very hard with myself not to drop it in the middle. In the end it got a little bit more interesting (if you will succeed in not paying attention to all kinds of gaps in the plot). The subject of the novel is computer security and the book has quite a few wrong statements and descriptions, which is disappointing. I would say that the author is far from the expert on this subject. Overall it is by far the weakest book by this writer.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Wow!  This guy is just way too smooth!  I really enjoyed Michael Buble's last two cds and he has most definitely topped that success with this new set of incredible songs.  I think this is his best work yet!<br /><br />  Buble starts out the cd with a nice song, \\"Feeling Good\\", which...well, makes you feel good!  He follows up with one great song after another.  Standouts to me are \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" with songbird, Nelly Furtado; \\"Home\\", an original song written by Buble, which is also the cd's first single; great uptempo versions of \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"How Sweet It Is\\" and lovely ballads like \\"Song for You\\" and \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\".  This is a great cd to pop in the player and listen to from beginning to end.  Nowadays its hard to say that about a lot of cds, but it is true of this one.  All the songs are perfectly picked for this album.<br /><br />Buble is, of course, compared to Sinatra and Harry Connick Jr but he's really finding his own place in the crooner/vocalist genre.  If he continues with cds like \\"It's Time\\", he's gonna be around for a long while and I don't think anybody will be complaining!  I HIGHLY recommend this cd.  Its a refreshing change from the hip hop and teen pop soaked air waves!
0385513755|4.0|I have finally bought and read (in 2 days!) The Da Vinci Code and I am glad I did.<br /><br />When released here in Australia, it created a storm of controversy. I simply found it  incredibly educational reading, and while not being overly religious, it gave me a greater understanding of a lot of religions. As a work of fiction, based on a lot of fact, it was brilliant.<br /><br />I am now about to buy the rest of Dans books and then create merry hell at parties by bringing up a few salient points of \\"The Code!!\\"<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Wally Schiel<br /><br />Geraldton, Western Australia.
B000089RV6|2.0|I honestly feel that this album is terrible. Despite the fact that nearly every cut on the record inevitable became a hit single, the music is watery and repetitive. Bon Scott was the one and ONLY singer of AC/DC.
B00028HBKM|4.0|The TRUTH is that Christianity offers a solution to those who have problems in life. Christianity is not the same as catholicism or related with the bad things done for over the centuries by the catholic church - like the evangelisation and slavery to the native people of different continents such as Africa and America's and the Holy Inquisition!    It IS Universal! The Laws of Christ are the laws that we - who live in a democratic and free country - still use! If Jesus have died to save the problems of mankind we should be must be thankfull in the year of the Lord 2005! Still His Birthday for us to remember! Always!    The meaning of this Mel Gibson's masterpiece is based on the universal message of Christ!
B00001NFCY|1.0|I swear to God that when I first heard these guys that I thought they were Pearl Jam. Or Stone Temple Pilots. Do me a favor, listen to the song \\"Alive\\" by Pearl Jam or \\"Plush\\" by Stone Temple Pilots, then listen to \\"Higher\\" by Creed. Unoriginal, untalented and rehashed is what Creed is.<br /><br />I thought for the fun of it that I should watch some Creed videos for the heck of it. Here are the ones I watched:<br /><br />\\"What If\\" - Stapp is in his infamous Eddie Vedder jacket and doing some poses, and there are makeout scenes and that dude from Scream 3 in it.<br />\\"Higher\\" - I laughed for an hour after watching this. You see Creed performing on stage, and they modified the video with lame Matrix-esque camera shots, and at the end, Scott Stapp is suspended into air.<br />\\"With Arms Wide Open\\" - At the end of the video, Stapp is on the top of a mountain and has his arms out a la Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Creed is just a big joke. If you want something original, buy an old Pearl Jam or Stone Temple Pilots CD, and let this bland and unhumorous sludge rot on the shelves.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|The Priest is back! But what exactly does the first album from the \\"classic\\" line-up of Halford, Tipton, Downing, Hill and Travis in 15 years have to offer? What stands out most with Angel of Retribution is that Priest are not \\"pushing the envelope\\" and/or trying to compete with younger bands as they did on Painkiller & the two CDs they did with Ripper Owens. It almost seems as if we have unreleased Priest songs that were re-recorded with a modern sound. (Speaking of which, the production for this CD is GREAT! Probably the best Priest have ever sounded.) <br /> <br />Obviously the quality of the songs is good, but the direction isn't quite what I expected. The songs in general have a very '80s-ish quality to them, they're not as intense as they were in the '90s and beyond (for the most part). Halford doesn't scream as much as he did on some previous releases, and I think there could have been more twin harmony leads, but maybe I'm just too picky. Regardless, Glenn & K.K. shine all throughout this beast, their solos are nothing short of brilliant & their riffs are vintage, classic Priest. There's lots of double-bass drumming throught the album, Scott Travis is awesome, but it's more about the mid-tempos on this one, with a only a few faster ones. <br /> <br />I think the chemistry is there & this line-up is incapable of making a bad album, but it's not as strong (in my opinion) as Painkiller was. My favorite song would be \\"Hellrider.\\" This is a wicked song that sticks in your head! \\"Angel\\" is a nice (power) ballad, which makes it all the more special, since Priest don't do many of these. \\"Judas is Rising,\\" \\"Deal With the Devil\\" and \\"Worth Fighting For\\" are also stand out tracks. Some songs, on the other hand, like \\"Wheels of Fire\\" and the first single \\"Revolution\\" are rather basic & not very memorable. Normally, I would be all over the 13 minute epic \\"Lochness\\" with its moody intro, and atmospheric vibe, but the main riff is basically a rip-off to the verse of the Sabbath classic \\"Electric Funeral.\\" Didn't anyone notice this in the writing/recording process? <br /> <br />Lyrically, we get standard Priest material. Not intellectual like Queensryche or Maiden, but not quite as clich/cheesy as say Manowar. I did like the fact that the titles of previous Priest songs and albums were interspersed throughout Angel of Retribution. <br /> <br />Bottom line is that it's great to hear Halford back in Priest and Angel of Retribution does have many killer songs. Not their best, but it's still better than 90% of the stuff out there. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could!
B00022LRXA|5.0|Brian Eno is one of the most marvelous paradoxes in all of music. He is both a musical genius and yet not the least virtuosic. On the one hand, as he is avid to emphasize, he is at most an average musician. He is competent as a guitarist, a keyboardist, and bass player, but hardly brilliant. If one hears a strikingly brilliant instrumental solo on a number, it is almost invariably the result of a contribution by one of the many musical guests on his albums. On the other hand, he is astonishingly masterful at constructing exquisite musical competitions, layering one marvelous element upon another to produce music that is both energizing and utterly unique. Eno possesses an almost preternatural ability to add a new wrinkle that cranks up the level excitement to a higher level, almost functioning like a sonic masseur who locates one musical pressure point after another with his subtle variations and machinations. BEFORE AND AFTER SCIENCE is one of his very finest albums. I would put it on a short list of his most essential works, along with the three other vocal albums (HERE COME THE WARM JETS, TAKING TIGER MOUNTAIN BY STRATEGY, and ANOTHER GREEN WORLD) and one purely instrumental album, AMBIENT IV. Although he is at best an adequate vocalist, his vocal albums have a richness of texture and content that is missing in all of the instrumental efforts. To say that the instrumental albums are more boring than the vocal ones doesn't quite get at the point: the instrumental albums seem empty at their core. They are not bad, but except for the sole exception noted above, none of them come anywhere near to the level of the four vocal albums.<br /><br />Although BEFORE AND AFTER SCIENCE was Eno's fourth (and up to the present, last-one fears that he may never attempt another) vocal album, it is possibly his most pop oriented. Although none of the cuts was a candidate for a top 40 hit, this album is far more accessible than anything else he has recorded. This could be a fault if the individual songs were not so marvelously done. Although this is not my favorite vocal album, it nonetheless has several cuts that I enjoy as much as anything that Eno has done. Nothing on this album approaches the extraordinary beauty of a cut like \\"Everything Merges With the Night\\" from ANOTHER GREEN WORLD, but it does contain several remarkable numbers. My personal favorites are \\"Blackwater,\\" a joyously surreal nautical tale that is notable for its hard driving energy and relentless forward momentum, and \\"King's Lead Hat,\\" which shows Eno at his creative peak. Other highlights include the opening cut \\"No One Receiving,\\" the fascinating \\"Kurt's Rejoinder,\\" \\"Energy Frees the Magician,\\" and the gentle, folkish \\"Here He Comes.\\"<br /><br />I originally got Eno's albums around the time that they were first released, and over the years they have provided me with as much consistent enjoyment as anyone I have listened to. Now that most of his better albums have been re-released on CD, all fans of music should avail themselves of this opportunity to experience these albums firsthand.the individual songs were not so marvelously done.

B000069HKH|3.0|Although it's been said many times, many ways, the worst Bruce Springsteen song is better than 90 percent of the rest of pop music.  The only problem is that Bruce's worst song might just be on this album, and it left me somewhat disappointed. <br /> <br />Springsteen's strength and appeal for me have always been his deeply personal and heartfelt lyrics and delivery.  In too many places on this album he seems to be copying others.  Worlds Apart is a little evocative of Desert Rose (Sting) or In Your Eyes (Peter Gabriel).  My City of Ruins almost seems to sample People Get Ready (which I think of as a Curtis Mayfield song, but you can pick your version).  Mary's Place seems practically plagarized from Sam Cooke's Meet Me at Mary's Place. <br /> <br />In short these and other songs on the album seem use grooves and rhythms we've all heard before leaving me feeling that I'm not really hearing Bruce, and unlike the liner notes of The Ghost of Tom Joad, this album doesn't seem to credit any source material. <br /> <br />It's unfair (and just plain wrong) as some have suggested to say that Bruce was cashing in on 9/11 or that he was condemning America with faint sorrow.  We don't have all to show our pain in the same way, and I would hope those that don't share Bruce's politics would accept that. <br /> <br />The album like most of his work shows both longing and hope.  What it doesn't show is focus.  As I said in the opening though, this is better that most other works out there, so maybe it's a 4 star pop album and a 2.5 star Bruce album. It's not up to The River, Born to Run, or Darkness on the Edge of Town, but it's still worth owning.
B000669GAI|4.0|In short, this is a great 2-disc collection from Pearl Jam, and \\"Rearviewmirror\\" is an excellent name for it. It could have possibly been a single disc, but then it really would have been lacking, so I'll take the 33 tracks anyday. Truthfully, I don't see anything really essential missing, though it does heavily favor the first three albums. At most I'd toss on another track or two from \\"Riot Act\\". One cool thing is that disc one is mostly the aggressive songs, and disc two is roughly the slower ones. This also includes the two songs from the \\"Singles\\" soundtrack, and a couple other non-album tracks. Again, a third of this collection is from the first two albums alone, so if you like those two, you should love this. But if you were never a big fan of grunge to begin with, or great music in general, this might be \\"Not For You\\".
B0007MVXQG|1.0|Unfortunately, the CD side of the disc won't play on our Apple iBook (the newer 1.2 GHz G4 model). You can hear the optical drive thrashing about, but the drive ejects the disc after about 30 seconds of trying. The DVD side appears to work. However, another problem is that the disc seems thicker than a usual CD. You have to push hard to get it in, and the drive has trouble pushing it out. I can easily imagine it getting stuck, and I'm not planning to experiment. <br /> <br />I don't know if this problem is specific to our machine, or to this particular disc, but I'm going to return the disc to where I bought it (not Amazon) and try to get a refund. <br /> <br />I was looking forward to the new Priest album. Sadly, I never got to hear it.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is a great Beatles album that says goodbye to the older Beatles \\"Poppy\\" and simple music, to the more complex, rocky, and better(?) era of their music. I'll do the usual song by song breakdown. (Keep in Mind i just got this album yesterday) <br /> <br />1. Drive My Car. 5/5. How can't you like this song. It epitimizes cool. Best Beatles opener so far. (until Sgt. Pepper) (which is beaten by Magical Mystery TOur) (Which is beaten with Back in the U.S.S.R as the best Beatles opener.) <br /> <br />2.Norweigan Wood (This Bird Has Flown). 5/5. The qualities of the main riff accompained by George's sitar is terrific. The lyrics are so amazing (considering that they're coming from more \\"lovey\\" songs). And then the vocal line is the same catchy riff. The percussion, although minimal, is also terrific. <br /> <br />3.You Won't See Me. 4.75/5. This is a great song. It lost a bit because the chorus is a bit boring. The verses are terrific. Especially the \\"OOOOH, LA LALA's.\\" (which was ripped off in the movie School of Rock (although I still like the movie.)). The lyrics are average. That little Post-chorus (bet there's another term for it.) part is cool (\\"Time after time....\\"). <br /> <br />4.Nowhere man. 4.75/5. Another teffific song. Nothing against the song but I think the version on the anthology DVD/VHS is better. Also, it seems strange that the reuse the \\"OhhLalala's\\" with a different rhythm. The words are also repetitive (everyline seems to mention somthing about No where or not knowing or whatever). <br /> <br />5. Think For Your Self. 5/5. This is another cool song. Of course the best piece of the puzzle is Pual and his mighty fuzz bass. A regualar bass doing that part wouldn't fit. The choice to use previously unused (by the Beatles) technology. Great. <br /> <br />6. THe Word. 4.75/5. Suffers in one way. Like \\"Nowhere Man\\", the lyrics repetitive. I just love the bass, the guitar, the vocals, the keyboards, the drums, which is EVERYTHING! (i also love whatever i missed.) <br /> <br />7. Michelle. 5/5. The French sound of this song is so cliche sounding but still terrific. I'd love to hear Alan Cumming sing this one! <br /> <br />8. What Goes on. 4/5. Cool, but the album's lowest point. The unmatching harmonies during the chorus are dreadfull. The country -esquesound, lyrics, verses (with good harmonies), and solo are redeeming qualities. <br /> <br />9. Girl. 4.5/5. Good song. Seems as though the narrator is depressed. The lyrics and mood of the vocals bring a mystique but it seems to try to recreate \\"Michelle.\\" <br /> <br />10. I'm Looking Through You. 5/5. One word. Sweet. The little organ and guitar part after \\"You're not The same\\" is so sick. It is a nice contrast to the calmsness of the rest of the song. <br /> <br />11. In My Life. 5/5. The intro sounds almost like some modern music. But the song soothes you're crazied ears from the frantic \\"I'm Looking Through YOu.\\" The sped up harpisichord-sounding solo is completely therrific. Ringo shines on this song. <br /> <br />12. Wait. 5/5. The song almost feels like a dramatic buildup. The little chord progression is completely catchy. It's one of the most transitional songs on the album. It has elements of pre and post- rubber soul songs. <br /> <br />13. If I Needed Someone 4.75/5. The guitar part almost seems cliched and Byrds-like. I gave it a 4.75 because something about this song doesn't \\"click\\" with me. <br /> <br />14. Run For Your Life. 5/5. THe coolness of this song provides a fullcircle view, (remember how cool \\"Drive My Car\\" Was.) THe violent lyrics are so funny cause they don't match the music (cept the last chord of the chorus). Like Pink FLoyd's \\"Free Four.\\" (Hey Beeblebrox!). One of the best cuts on the album. Not a great ender though. <br /> <br />There my first Beatles review. If you liked this. Please click Yes. Thanks. See ya soon.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Ordinarily, there is nothing wrong with a musician releasing an album of interpretations from their key musical heroes. Look at the roster of artists who have dedicated albums to such legends as Billie Holiday, Cole Porter, and Frank Sinatra. But there is a special problem in the case of Robert Johnson and Eric Clapton: Clapton has spent nearly his entire (uneven) forty year-career tapping into the Johnson legacy. Where is Clapton's own inspiration? <br /> <br />Now Clapton has done some amazing Johnson covers over the years (witness his blazing performance of \\"Crossroads\\" from his days with Cream), but the tepid versions of RJ's most essential joints on this CD are an insult to the man who helped shape American music. Clapton shouldn't have even touched \\"Red Hot;\\" there's no way for someone who ain't Southern to get that racy vocal sound. His turn on \\"32-20 Blues\\" is completely screwed up. The biggest faux-pas though, is \\"Come On in My Kitchen.\\" The morbid, otherworldly atmosphere that RJ created on the original is missing in action on Clapton's version. <br /> <br />As for the question of \\"color\\" that many of Clapton's fans are raising with his critics, let's be clear here. What Robert Johnson and his artistic peers experienced was not some ghost called \\"the blues.\\" It was real oppression and discrimination that threatened their health and safety every day of their lives. The pain that these men and women endured from this reality was channeled into their music. There is no way that Eric Clapton can tap into this well of pain, no matter how many personal tragedies he has faced. At the end of the day, the blues is not Clapton's experience. I want to hear Eric Clapton's experience on record.
B0006399FS|4.0|After about 90 listens now, I find this to be another solid U2 album. What I notice most about it, is that it really reminds me of the last record, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", which I guess makes sense. Specifically, \\"Vertigo\\" seems to be the \\"Beautiful Day\\" of this album, and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", sounds like this records \\"Stuck In A Moment\\", etc. However, this is not a bad thing, as the last album was excellent. What keeps this from being a 5-star release, is the few tracks I consider to be really good filler, and not \\"wow\\" songs. In short, this album is easy to sum up: the U2-haters can pass on it obviously, but the U2-lovers need it like the rest of their releases, and most will consider it to be the \\"Bomb\\".
B0007P3582|3.0|Everyone was talking about this album prior to its release.  And then with the whole Game/50 war that started the Monday of this CD's release, I'm sure many people ran to pick this up like I did. <br /> <br />My first complaint is probably one of the biggest disappointments of my life, called \\"Piggybank\\".  Everyone said that this would 'end careers' and that it would be the next \\"Ether\\" or \\"Back Down\\".  Yet when I heard it, I felt like my ears were gonna explode.  50 has lost his touch of coming up with clever disses like he did on \\"Back Down\\" and \\"How To Rob\\".  He disses Nas for falling in love, and he just disses Jadakiss and Fat Joe for doing \\"New York\\" with Ja.  Then he even has the nerve to attack Shyne again, who served 50's a$$ from prison with \\"For the Record\\". <br /> <br />Now there are good, even great tracks on here, but most of them are average.  \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" displays a very realistic view of heroin.  50 does a good enough job talking from the perspective of heroin and the chorus is haunting and touching.  \\"Ski Mask Way\\" is another great song with an old soulful sound.  50 describes how to rob people and does a good enough job of it.  \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" is all good until the chorus comes up.  50 sings his way through the hook, backed by rapid gunfire.  \\"My Toy Soldier\\" doesn't have anything to do with Eminem's song, instead discussing how 50 sends his soldiers to war.  It'd be just average if not for Tony Yayo's rowdy and humorous verse.  The \\"Hate it or Love it Remix\\" amazed me even more.  Game's new verse is obviously going at 50 and G-Unit, and the rest of G-Unit does a pretty good job, especially Yayo who fits the song better than Banks and Buck.   <br /> <br />The beats are pretty good altogether.  \\"Gunz Come Out\\" has a haunting horns instrumental created by Dr. Dre, yet \\"Outta Control\\" sounds like a lot like Game's \\"Higher\\".  \\"I Don't Need Em\\" completely steals Ghostface Killah's \\"Metal Lungies\\" beat.   <br /> <br />Now the badsongs.  \\"God Gave Me Style\\" would work except for the fact that 50 is saying God gives him the talent that he has.  Yet I don't think God would approve of tracks like \\"Piggy Bank\\", \\"Gunz Come Out\\", and \\"Candy Shop.  \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\" has a great beat, but is ruined by 50's lame rapping.  \\"Disco Inferno\\" is a real catchy song, but 50 hardly raps on this song.   <br /> <br />If you're a 50 fan, you'll dig this.  Otherwise I suggest Game's CD.
0375703764|1.0|I could easily understand and interpret the material I was reading without a doubt, however the books itself was empty. I failed to really grasp the meaning which the book represented, and truthfully I thought the novel lacked something other than dullness. When I first started reading the book my first impression was one that was dark and unkind, the book was boring me to tears. I set the book aside, then a few weeks later I decided that I should give the book another try and I did so without hesitation. I read a little further, and then a little further and then I came to the books end. I still, till this day cannot tell anyone what it was about other than it is about a man who moves into his dream home in the quiet country side of virginia with his lovely family. The house begins to grow and suddenly the world around them becomes dark, beings are following them, beasts with long claws stalking them to their graves. Nice story line, I have read about such things before. The complex idea of the house growing has been used before in Stephen King's Rose Red which was a great movie, on ABC. However the idea was odd yet over done. Read something a little more moving and intellectual, anything by Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, and H.P. Lovecarft is good.
B0007NFL1S|1.0|i dont care i hate 50 cent as a person, human being, or whatever he wants to be. he is still calling ja rule bubblegum so what about him? candyshop? thats not bubblegum? disco inferno? thats not bubblegum??? 50 cent is a moron he became ja rule with all his stupid love music thats why i hate him. F**K YOU 50 CENT I HOPE YOU GO OUT OF BUSINESS!!!
B000002L9B|5.0|Now I know what your thinking oh this review is too long, but that is how beutiful this masterepeice is. From the first whimsical tune to the sad acoustic classic, this would go down as his greatest album yet. But there is one problem, he has too many great albums. First off is the oddball but fantastic intro \\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\" which has a sound like it's namesake this is a joyful tune that gets you started in the right mood. Then, Prince keeps the tape rolling and delivers the funky drum machine known as \\" New Positon\\" in which he uses the Linn drum system and armed with the word honey and says in a way in which you can't help but repeat. Once again he doesn't stop the tape and presents the cryptic but strangly satisfying \\"I Wonder You\\" the guitar at the end is a quenching way to end the song. For the last time the tape flows to the piano composed balled \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\" sung with beutiful lyrics and composed by Prince's father John L. Nelson. Then he finally stops the tape and delivers a fast paced tune to restore a happy atmosphere with \\"Girls and Boys\\" this is a great track with a great showcaswe of horns by Eric Leeds which is a precursor to later Prince efforts and this song also has a great video. Next is my favorite track from this album which is hard to say cause the album is all great, anyway \\"life Can Be So Nice\\" is a percussion of insturments like cowbells played by Shelia E. to a great drum solo by the man himself this his the perfect up-beat track to follow \\"Girls and Boys.\\" The next two tracks are some of the most underrated tracks that Prince has created. First is well Prince's first instermental tracks in \\"Venus De Milo\\" which is almost a Blues R&B fusion with classical orcestration by Claire Fischer. Next is a almost uplfting track \\"Mountains\\" again a wonderful horn solo by Eric Leeds. Next is the brilliant \\"Do You Lie\\" which is a song that sounds like a conversation or a word manner, but still has a singing notes in it. It is a nice song and resembles \\"Strollin'\\" from Diamonds an Pearls. Then is the most infamous song on the cd and one of the most famous Prince songs ever and a great dance song ever \\"Kiss.\\" This song Prince just did the acoustics and then gave the song to someone else and they added the sound effects, then Prince heard it and immediatly took it back and turned it into a instant classic. This is a song that will turn  you into a Prince fan and must be played at every dance party. \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\" is a song that is ahead of its time and you can tell in the first 10 seconds that you will be wearing out strings on this song with the great mixture of piano and drums. Finally the last track is the guitar ballad \\"Sometimes It Snows In April\\" this is a heart felt track that is full of real emotions much like Michael Jackson's \\"She Out Of My Life\\", both are songs that can make you cry and are classics. Overall this is a must-by and is a classic without bounds. This would be a even greater album with \\"Old Friends 4 Sale\\" which is a must-listen to and is a greatly done old soul blues song (this song is on the vault/old friends 4 sale). This album is timeless and will have you as an instant Prince fan with dance tracks like \\"Kiss\\" to ballads like \\"Sometimes It Snows In April.\\" This is a great album and movie so both are excellent and give innovation to each of their classes with the way Prince keeps the tape rolling through tracks 1-4. The last word on this is that you need to have this album (burned or brought.) 0+>
B00006690G|5.0|Here we go again, another hot album from the best rapper alive.  Eminem has got away from the drugs and constant vulgar and violent lyrics and gets a little more serious.  The best songs on the album are \\"Til I Collapse,\\" \\"Soldier,\\" and \\"Say What You Say.\\"  You can't find much wrong with this album except for that Em changed his style dramatically.  Nevertheless this is still a very good album, amazing lyrics and good production.  All rap fans should definitely add this album to their rap collection, it's definitely worth your money.  I promise you, it won't disappoint you.
B000023VR6|4.0|Dr Dre (aka Andre Young) released this back in 1999 six years after his classic 'The Chronic' since then he has left Death Row and now has made Interscope/Aftermath Records which he produced this on, as you can guess it sounds different which it does, gone is the g-funk and Nuthin but a g thang, but instead is newer beats and Still DRE. Many rappers feature on this album including Eminem, Kurupt, Snoop, Hitman, King T, MC Ren, Xzibit and many others including Mary J Blige on 'The Message' which is very different to the other 'gangsta' tracks. The production is by Dre himself and on some tracks he doesn't rap but has the beats, anyway the beats are amazing on most of the 22 tracks. The standouts for me are 'Forgot About DRE' which got me onto dre and features Eminem. 'Whats The Difference' features Xzibit and Em. 'Still DRE' with Snoop has some tight beats, even though they sound a bit generic in a way. Also check 'The Watcher' which is probably the only track with just dre, 'Big Ego's' and 'Bang Bang'. The only weak tracks are 'Let's Get High' 'Pause4 Porno' and the skits which waste time. Overall this is worth a listen and if you are into Dre's music then definitely check it.<br /><br />Hip Hop 4 Life..
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|This box set happens to include many of MJ's hits and big numbers like \\"Rock With You\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"Black and White.\\" It also includes some rarities and cuts not heard before. The problem I have with the disc is the number of songs that are missing. Where is \\"Human Nature?\\" \\"We Are the World?\\" \\"Say Say Say?\\" \\"Liberian Girl?\\" \\"Another Part of Me?\\" \\"Will You Be There?\\" It's missing quite a few of the hits that Michael has put out there, and for that reason I have to deduct one star from this otherwise perfect set of music.
B00009V7RF|1.0|I ain't into this a all, I dont know why I bought it cause I only listened to half of it then put it in my drawer where I keep wack albums (50 Cent, Sean Paul, P Diddy) and havent listened to it since (I bought it soon after it was out) I admit tho at first I enjoyed it a bit, but not much, it got boring after 1 minute. I think fergie ruined the group and made them more mainstream, also this music appeals to pop fans mostly, if you want real music then listen to one of these.<br /><br />Ice Cube-Amerikkkas Most Wanted<br />Ice Cube-Death Certificate<br />Ice Cube-The Predator<br />Dr Dre-The Chronic<br />Nas-Illmatic<br />A Tribe Called Quest-People's Instinctive Travels and the paths of rhythmn<br />Mobb Deep-The Infamous
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is one of my favorite bands and their latest album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, is definitely one of the better I own. In my opinion, Chris Martin's voice is good, but it is the beautiful instrumentations that make the album. The lyrics are simple and sincere, an excellent and rare virtue in the pop/rock these days. Refreshing and unpretentious love songs with no lofty ambitions make the album what it is. Overall, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is soothing and mellow and if you're in the right mood for it, can send you soaring. Some of my favorite songs include \\"Amsterdam\\" \\"Warning Sign\\" \\"Green Eyes\\" and the obvious \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist\\"
B0007VCZ50|5.0|Bring On the Night is a rock and roll classic and a must for any Sting Fan.  In 1985 Sting left the Police, the biggest band in the world, after their biggest album and tour, to make a solo album with four unknown, young black jazz musicians from the states.  The sound was out of step with the times, jazz soaked and daring.  The film tells the story of prelude to opening night of the tour in Paris and gives a unique behind the scenes perspective of the genisis of a  band.  Fantastic
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Miyazaki has a gift for creating an alternate world that is consistent in its own rules.  Indeed, only Miyazaki could have carried off this movie about a seaplane pilot turned into a pig.  But now having experienced several of Miyazaki's works, I think that they are so successful because they extol good and honest behavior.<br /><br />After \\"Spirited Away\\" I have sought out all Miyazaki's films--they are fun, they aren't predictable, they speak to all ages and they don't leave you embarrassed to have spent money on the entertainment.<br /><br />As the father of several daughters, call me corny, but I enjoyed and appreciated the character of the young engineer (Piccolo's granddaughter) who was anxious to prove herself.  She worked hard and validated everyone's confidence in her talents.  Hardwork and achievement:  What a great message that is so often lost in Hollywood's clumsy offerings.<br /><br />The movie was so enjoyable because it honored good character.  The \\"right\\" things happened.  The honorable characters succeeded.  The good guy wins.  Yet there is not a hint of formula in the movie.  So often such movies are so predicable that you end up rooting for the bad guy, but in Miyazaki's movies the themes of love, honor, honesty are all given excellent treatment and I cannot recommend them enough.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|First of all, this is a very good album, with few weak tracks.  But if you are trying to get into Guns N' Roses, I would recommnend first buying Appetite For Destruction, which is almost a \\"Best Of\\" album itself.  GN'R only released five albums, and the few tracks on Greatest Hits just don't do them justice.  Skip this, and go with AFD, and I guarantee you will be hooked on Guns N' Roses enough to buy their other albums.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Miyazaki's movies extol virtue.  The lead character in this work derives her power from an understanding of the world in which she lives and from her unselfish service to others.  Interestingly and in contrast with most movies this director rewards the good characters and punishes the bad without ever seeming formulaic.<br /><br />This movie is set in a post-apocalyptic world and reflects a strong environmentalist mindset--take care of the Earth and all that--but it is much more.  As opposed to written works, movies do not have the time to explore characters and have to use shorthand to clue you in--the Japanese do this well.  You would have to go as far as Kubrick's 2001 to find another movie as bizarrely imaginative as this one.<br /><br />My wife shakes her head when I keep bringing these Miyazaki movies home, but I've got to say that I find them so much more enjoyable than the typical movie offerings because they are so imaginative.  Whether about bathhouses for spirits, flying pigs, evil cat kings, etc., these movies all demonstrate the value of being good and honorable--they are worthy entertainment.
B00000099Y|2.0|I don't want to over-emphasize musical classifications, but let's all be honest with ourselves here.  Why does TOOL get this undeserved label of Progressive metal?  TOOL is not the neo-progressive metal saviors that critics write about.<br /><br />Are they musically talented?  Most of the time.<br /><br />Are they controversial?  Definitely.<br /><br />Are they unique?  Not at all.<br /><br />They are simply carbon copies of so many other nu-metal and alternative metal acts.  Some synonyms for the word \\"Tool\\":<br />NIN, Filter, Deftones, System of a Down, Korn, Drowning Pool, Disturbed, etc...(Shall I go on?  I can.)<br /><br />I have given \\"Aenima\\" three complete spins on three different occasions, and I just can't see (or hear, in this case) what the big deal is with this band.  Though the music is somewhat interesting, it has the same old nu-metal trademark of thick, dissonant power chord crunches syncopated between the drumbeats.  Add really angry, teenager-like screams about how you're picked on in high school for being different or how your parents choked your individuality, and you've got yourself a nu-metal band.  Oh yeah, you have to mercilessly mock organized religion in at least 75% of your songs.<br /><br />Maybe I'm too picky.  Maybe I'm overly critical.  Maybe I am too quick to over-classify.  What I AM certain of, is that you should NOT buy this album if you are expecting anything remotely \\"progressive\\" from it.  If it smells, sounds, tastes and looks like tired, old nu-metal, then...
B000089CJI|5.0|I was first introduced to this cd after it was played in the store I had worked and loved it. It was hugely popular amongst my coworkers and myself. I immediately went out and bought the cd. It is still in heavy rotation in my cd collection - can anyone seriously get sick of the district sleeps tonight? It is such a beautiful blend of lyrics and refreshing pop music. Despite my snobbish love for all things british, I definitely make an exception for the postal service.
B000001FS3|5.0|There are albums that define a generation. Bob Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", The Who's \\"Tommy\\", Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\", Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", and, recently, Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\". These are all masterpieces, but they do span across generations like The Joshua Tree. The only other album in it's league is the Beatles \\"Sergent Peppers\\". Yes, it is that good. <br />U2 is a unique band, one that has been able to spread itself through four generations and 25 years of music. Some remember it's edgy earlier work, like Boy. Others remember the beautiful unforgetable fire. Their modern masterpiece Achtung baby is another one of their finest. Today, we are all in a place called vertigo, and it is a beautiful day. But the Joshua Tree seems to stand about all of the others. From the slow building intro to \\"Where the Streets have No Name\\" to the last painful note of \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\", you are taken on a painful ride. You are left bruised, battered and changed. This is the only record where I left chilled. The more famous tracks on the record are the first three, it is the latter half that makes this record great. Two stand out songs are One Tree Hill and Running to Stand Still. The first is a painful look inside Bono, and the loss of his friend Greg Carroll. The latter is a harrowing look into the world of heroin abuse.  <br />The music on this CD is, of course immaculate. Bono's voice shirlls and moans, allowing us to feel every emotion inside him. The Edge's minimalist guitar is what defines the band, and all of his best work is on the record. And Larry Mullin Jr. and Adam Clayton are thumping away here, keep the tempo and giving us the most memorable rythmn line of our time (With or Without You). <br />When they finished this record, The Edge was afraid. He said that he thought that is was not connected and did not follow a pattern. But in the end, it all seem connected. If you want to hear the last great musical group of our time, listen to this one first, their best record. <br />
B0007O38F8|4.0|Lets not kid ourselves here; there aren't many good mainstream rap albums being released these days. So in retrospect, \\"The Massacre\\" is quite a good rap album. Yeah the lyrics illustrate the usual death, murder, girls and money but it's done really well -- it's entertaining. If you bought this album expecting introspective and deep lyrics, than your on the wrong end of stick. For everybody else, this is a nice piece of entertainment.  <br /> <br />4/5
6305428050|5.0|This is by far the best 80s movie money can buy.  I was just a wee little one when it was first released, but I remember loving it even then.  Now I'm 23 and I actually am able to appreciate the quirky humor even more.  This movie brings me to tears of laughter everytime I watch it.   <br /> <br />Elisabeth Shue, while excellent in the dramas she's been doing lately, is magnetic in the comedic role of Chris Parker.  All three actors who play the kids she ends up babysitting are hilarious and not annoying in the least, which is a rarity.  Penelope Ann Miller as Chris's friend Brenda is hysterical, especially in a memorable phone booth scene.   <br /> <br />The only disappointment comes from the fact that this DVD has so little to offer in the Extras department.  Hopefully in a couple years we'll see a 20th anniversary edition with commentary tracks and cast interviews/updates.  Either way, this movie is a must-have.  So many memorable one-liners!  Elisabeth Shue dancing around to the Crystals!  Vincent D'Ononfrio buffed out and greased up!  Buy this DVD.  Now.
B0007P3582|1.0|I'll admit it, although I'm from the west coast and I support The Game in the upcoming rap war, 50 Cent's first album, \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\", was off the chain.  Party anthems, street gospels watever.  But now he's rich, he knows whatever he puts out will be bought.  The Massacre, 50 Cent's sophmore album, is a total disaster with only three good tracks: \\"So Amazing (Feat. Olivia)\\", \\"A Lil' Bit\\", \\"Outta Control\\".  Others are just ignorant and you can tell that this album was done with no effort or hungriness at all.  On the song \\"Get in my Car\\", 50 exclaims: \\"I got no pickup lines/I stay on the grind/I tell the hoes all the time/ B*tch get in my car!\\"  Absolutely just one example of his horrible lyrics on the album.  50's flow is off on \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" and he loses any sense of composure on the horrible tracks: \\"My Toy Soldiers\\", \\"This is 50\\", \\"My Hood\\".  Quoting a magazine who also reviewed the album, it is definately easy to see that 50 Cent \\"got rich\\" and \\"stopped trying.\\"  G-Unit is slipping, go Game.
B00005R62K|5.0|Recorded and released in 1978, \\"Stained Class\\" is a Great, classic album!  Right up there with \\"Screaming\\" as the best JP album. This is probably the last in your face politically and socially conscience album by JP.  All of the songs have intelligent lyrics that aren't catered for AOR stations.  Here are my rating of the songs based out of 5 *****:<br /><br />  \\"Exciter\\" - Fast drum opening from Les Binks into a furiuos tempo that never lets up. The hardest and fastest song on the album, this song has the same stucture as \\"Call For The Priest\\" from their previous album. It lays the foundation for \\"Screaming For Vengance\\" and \\"Freewheel Burning\\".  Nice sci-fi lyrics here.  Strong S&M overtones.  A great song. Classic. Rating - *****<br /><br />  \\"White Heat, Red Hot\\"  - Nice guitar opening riff.  Another fast tempo song. Nice fast guitar solo. Good lyrics, with condeming religious overtones.  Solid bass work from Ian.  Rob sounds great!  Rating - *****<br /><br />  \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" -  Cover of Spooky Tooth song played the way I'm sure they wished they had played it.  Rob sounds great.  A song of despair and loneliness.  Rob is singing about himself here.  Great cover version.  Rating - ****<br /><br />  \\"Stained Class\\" -  The titular song.  A nice chunky guitar sound.  Another fast paced song, with a tempo change in the middle. Rob is real high- pitched here, some great wails. A condemnation on society.  Great lyrics.  Rob is angry and it comes through clear.  Great song.  Rating - *****<br /><br />  \\"Invader\\" - Nice sci-fi song with sci-fi opening sound effects.  Nice bass lines from Ian.  Nice singing from Rob.  Tempo changes throughout.  Nice guitar solos.  The weakest song on the album, but still classic.  Rating - ***<br /><br />  \\"Saints In Hell\\" -  Boy I love this song.  Rob lets the religious establishment have it here.  No sugarcoating from Rob.  Rob has something to say and you are going to hear it! \\"Wake the dead.  The saint's are in hell.  Wake the dead.  they come for the bell!\\"  Mercyful Fate and King Diamond get their inspiration here.  Great black metal song. Robs does some of his best and highest singing here. The emotion from Rob is palpable. Glen and KK are in total sync.  A hard hitting song that NEEDS, DEMANDS to be heard. It deserves to be in the live set! One of the greatest JP songs ever!  I LOVE this song! Rating - **************<br /><br />  \\"Savage\\" - Another song condeming society's Janus faced ways.  The song opens with Rob screaming at the top of his lungs.  And he has reason to be screaming!  \\"Who gives you the right to come here and tell me I have to leave this place my home?\\"  Rob again is in our face with intelligent lyrics. A great guitar solo is also here.  Rating - *****<br /><br />  \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\" -  A song by Les Binks and Rob.  A nice haunting guitar intro  leads to some of Rob's finest singing to be heard on vinyl.  The song builds up steam and strength.  Some nice tempo changes here. A song of despair and loneliness that Rob pours his heart out singing. Another song condeming society and its hipocracy.  A song about inner termoil and the inability to solve the problem due to society's rigidness.  A great guitar solo to end the song. \\"They lie in thousands plagued and lost.  Is nothing worth this bitter cost?\\"  A classic song.  One of the best songs JP has done.  Rating- *****<br /><br />  \\"Heroes End\\" -  I love this song.  Some great singing from Rob, from gutteral lows to high-pitched wails.  A song about Janis, Jimi and James.  Great guitar solos.  Nice tempo changes here.  A song that NEEDS TO BE IN THE LIVE SET! A great chugging Sabbath like song.  One of my Favorites. Rating - *****<br /><br />  Overall, A GREAT, CLASSIC album that JP should think about playing live.  They ought to do the whole album live like Slayer did with \\"Reigning\\".  I would pay alot to hear/see that and I bet every JP fan would too.  C'mon Priest, what do you say?  Give this album the recognition it deserves, and dedicate a tour to playing it live.
0385510454|4.0|Ok, if you're dead set on a Grisham legal thriller, this ain't it.  But, if you're looking for a fun, very readable diversion into various locations in Italy and a believable protagonist who's not all good nor bad, try The Broker.  <br />I thought the technology the bad guys were stealing was a bit far fetched, but, hey!  What's willing suspension of disbelief for, anyway? <br />The descriptions of Bolonga, Italy made me want to go make some pasta the old fashioned way.  <br />I was looking forward to G's latest return to legal thrillers and, though I didn't get it, I wasn't disappointed.
B0007O38F8|4.0|I bought fifty's \\" the Massacre,\\" the day after it came out on the 4th of March.  They hype was high, but I too had no I idea how the album would sound. When I first listened to it, I skimed through the CD looking for tracks that I liked.  But I knew that if I was to truly appreciate the album, I would have to listen to it straight through a few times.  Now All 22 songs on the album have grown on me with the exception of \\"Disco inferno\\", and \\"Candy Shop,\\"because they have been played out. <br />     To all those who are interested in the \\"Massacre.\\"  Don't base you decision to buy this album on someone else's opinion.  Listen to it yourself.  I believe that MTV website is still Leaking the album were you can listen to it for free.  (you'll need Windows media player 9 or up for that)  <br />     Finally, you can't go in expecting this to be \\"Get rich or die tryin'\\" all over again.  50 as an artist is trying to progress, like all artists.  You never heard Nas say that he wanted to make another illmatic, or jay'z say that he wanted to make another Reasonable Doubt. <br />Buyers who do decide to get this... be open to change. Peace...
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|The movie in and of itself was entertaining. <br />HOWEVER, that said, I do not know HOW they can justify saying this movie was based on the book written by Robert Ludlum. This movie had as much in common with the novel as apples have in common with oranges. The majority of the novel is set in Hong Kong and Mainland China, NOT Europe. <br />There is NOTHING in the novel about Russian oil leases, and Marie does not DIE in the first 15 minutes of the story. In fact, she does not DIE at all. She IS kidnapped, which is the lure that draws Jason in... <br />
B00008DDSC|4.0|OK, they say you should never judge a book by its cover, but the only reason I bought this movie was because of the cover. It's one of the funkiest covers I've seen recently, and it aroused my curiosity, as to what the film was actually about. So I bought it, along with Notting Hill.<br /><br />Although I did originally want to watch Tears of the Sun, it was too long, and it was already quite late at night. So I chose this instead. There was a severe lack of extras on this DVD that I bought, just a couple of trailers, and one particularly for House of 1000 Corpses (ugh!). I doubt I would have paid full price for the DVD with extras though. Although it would have been good to see what Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader said about the film.<br /><br />I'd previously only seen Maggie Gyllenhaal in Donnie Darko (alongside her real life gorgeous brother, Jake) & Mona Lisa Smile, so wasn't sure what to expect from her in the main role, although she certainly shone in Mona Lisa Smile. However, she's an excellent, versatile actress. I wasn't as keen on James Spader though, I think someone sort of sexier looking, or more evil looking could have done the part a lot better. For some reason I have Jack Nicholson's face in my head now, which isn't pretty, so lets try Christian Slater instead! I suppose James Spader played the slightly nerdy type OK, but I still think someone better could have filled his shoes. Plus, he's not a \\"hottie\\" as other reviewers have described. Maybe it's just me, but I like a bit of rough! Not Jack Nicholson though - bleurgh. (Now Gwyneth Paltrow was going to play Lee Holloway - that wouldn't have been good at all!!!)<br /><br />This film wasn't subtle in any way, by portrayed some of the stuff it did, which would have people avoiding the movie altogether, and censors running for their 'red pens'. The relationship between Lee & Edward (or if you prefer, Mr Gray or Sir) is definitely a strange one, but fascinating at the same time, as he blows hot & cold with her. One minute he wants her, the next he doesn't. I love the way he watched her too, when he thought she wasn't looking, and the way he kept that one red pen. I loved the way she desperately tried to get his attention, including sending him a worm in the mail - I'm not sure I got that. The S&M scenes are kept relatively tame in tone and the film displays a wickedly funny sense of humour for most of its duration. I'm not sure I would go as far as the heavy handed spanking myself doesn't really do it for me, but I applaud the makeup artists, for the fantastic job on the bruising on Maggie's behind.<br /><br />The differences between the two scenes, the first one with Lee & the boyfriend she gets lumped with, and then Mr Gray, are huge. It's obvious she doesn't want to be with Peter, and he's boring in bed. And makes the strangest noises!!!<br /><br />I'm not sure I would call this a love story. The finale, although upbeat, was a bit out of touch with the rest of the movie. The relationship is moving (very moving, in fact). But, because of the nature of the relationship, there are some very funny scenes, like Lee masturbating, while repeating the dinner instructions Spader gave her earlier in the evening (four peas, a half-scoop of mash, and as much ice cream as she can eat). I found the similar James Spader scene quite strange. Her eyes though when he first spanks her, she has got really expressive eyes, next to Neve Campbell.<br /><br />With quite a few relationships/flings starting in the office, this gives the movie its shock value.<br /><br />I'm not sure about the nudity towards the end though. It was completely unnecessary for the movie. I didn't particularly need to see Maggie full frontal (which you will get guys), and she looks like she needs a good feeding! Although I was wishing I had a stomach like hers, not if I need to starve myself to get it.<br /><br />It would have been interesting to see the extras to on this, just to see whether James or Maggie mentioned that they needed a few stiff ones (DRINKS!) to do some scenes. On the \\"extras\\" version of this DVD, the extras include a commentary by director Steven Shainberg and the writers; a featurette and a photo gallery.<br /><br />The song that plays over Mr. Gray and Lee at the end of the movie is \\"Chariots Rise\\" by Lizzie West. The original lyric is \\"What a fool am I, to fall so in love,\\" but the director did not want to imply that Lee was being foolish, and asked if it could be altered. Because she wanted the song to be in the movie, Lizzie West re-recorded the line as \\"What grace have I, to fall so in love.\\"<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie, although not for the easily embarrassed (which I would have normally said I was), or young innocents out there. You need to view this movie with an open mind.ether James or Maggie mentioned that they needed a few stiff ones (DRINKS!) to do some scenes.

0440237688|5.0|\\"The Giver\\" is an excellent book and really captures the reader. I greatly enjoyed the origional and creative plot, and I couldn't put the book down until I was done. \\"The Giver\\" makes you think quite a lot about your own life. It is wonderfully written and I hope you take the time to read this fasanating book.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Songs in the Key of Life is wonderful, perhaps the best 5 albums ever.  Stevie Wonder is a genius.
0385335482|5.0|This was a great read!  It was my gym book for a few days and was so good that I found myself pulling it out of the gym bag in the evenings to enjoy it more!  I definitely reccomend this book for anyone who loves shopping, loves 'chic lit' and enjoys a funny read.
B000002UAF|1.0|This is bad.  The Beatles were so overhyped, an this movie proves it. <br /> <br />A Hard Day's Night put me in a deep sleep.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|Madeleine's voice pours over you with a sweetness that is undeniable.  As a relative \\"newbie\\" to this type of music, I was very pleased with how easy it was to lose myself in her songs.  The laid-back beat and sultry basslines will hold on to you, drawing you in to a relaxed mood.  Definitely worth a listen!
B0001AP158|1.0|This DVD was a total let down.  All the songs are in mellow, acoustical form, not at all like the orginals.  I expected much more than what I got.  All the songs are BALLADS.  Do not expect any rock/metal feel to it.  Why they would do this is totally unclear.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!
B000002LEM|5.0|There's no one this planet who can beat Edward Van Halen when it comes to guitar playing. This guitar god who started as a drummer and a piano player displays his craft so clean and neat in this album. Van Halen just found a perfect and powerful vocalist for this ever great rock band. All of the songs are melodically written and arranged by these four great musicians. Ed & Alex's trademark styles are very evident in this album. For those who dig trash metal noises out there, try listening to powerful rock music of the world's greatest living guitarist - Ed Van Halen. This is so far their greatest and the best album ever recorded.
B00028HBKM|5.0|For the first time in my life, when it comes to discussing a film, I've been rendered nearly speechless. Mel Gibson's `The Passion of the Christ,' which depicts the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus, defies the typical `it's good' or `it's bad' mentality of a review. It's so visually gripping, so heart-wrenching and so emotionally draining that writing about it simply can't do it justice. <br /> <br />Gibson, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay, went to great lengths to make sure his film was Biblically accurate and it shows. Jesus (played brilliantly by James Caviezel, `Frequency') looks Jewish, instead of the blond-haired, blue-eyed man usually seen in the role. Every line spoken is in Aramaic or Latin (with English subtitles). Every prop used, from whips and swords to clothing and wigs, looks stunningly authentic. What emerges is the most realistic depiction of Christ's suffering ever put on screen. <br /> <br />Most films about Jesus begin at His birth, give a kind of Cliff's Notes glance-over of His life, and make crucifixion seem slightly unpleasant - not `Passion.' The film is entirely about the journey to that specific event and shows it's possibly the most horrific method used to kill someone. `Passion' begins as Jesus agonizes in the Garden of Gethsemane, so troubled by His upcoming duty that His sweat turns to blood. <br /> <br />As He prays, He fights a spiritual battle. He knows He must die and, despite leading a sinless life, take on the sins of mankind so they can be saved. He has been abandoned by His followers. He is constantly tempted by Satan, who tells Jesus that one man can't possibly die for everyone's sins. After setting aside His own will and seeking His Father's, Jesus is betrayed by Judas Iscariot (one of His disciples) and handed over to Jewish authorities and eventually the Roman government. <br /> <br />What follows is an unflinching look at the way Christ was killed. His beatings, scourging and eventual crucifixion at the hands ofRoman soldiers is shown in graphic detail. Where other films would cut away, `Passion' zooms in - every punch, every piece of flesh ripped away, every drop of blood, every thorn in His crown and every nail driven into His body is vividly captured on camera. <br /> <br />The film is slightly over two hours long, starts with Christ's arrest in the Garden and ends with His resurrection (covered in about 12 seconds). Everything between is His brutal suffering and it is relentless. There are several brief flashbacks to earlier times in Christ's life to provide a short relief from the violence, but none long enough for the audience to forget what they are watching. <br /> <br />The controversy that has surrounded `Passion' in recent months (consisting mostly of claims that it's anti-Semitic) is unfortunate. Yes, some Jews are responsible for the death of Jesus. But so are some Romans and, most importantly, so are the rest of us. Everyone, whether literally or symbolically, placed Jesus Christ on that cross to die. The film in no way implies that the Jewish nation as a whole is to blame for killing Him. <br /> <br />As a Christian, this film is a wake-up call. I've always known that Jesus suffered and died for me. I even know the physical things that happen during a scourging and crucifixion. Seeing the process right in front of you, however, is a completely different matter. I have never cried as hard as I did during `The Passion of the Christ.' As I watched Jesus being beaten, spit upon, whipped to near-death and ultimately nailed to a piece of wood, all I could keep thinking, over and over again, was `He did that for me. He did that for all of us.' <br /> <br />C.S. Lewis once said that Jesus could only be one of three things: Lord (as He said He was), a liar or a lunatic. Before viewing `The Passion of the Christ,' and strongly reinforced afterward, there is only one option for me. Whether Christian or non-Christian, I strongly urge you to see this film.  <br /> <br />
B0007P3582|5.0|Yo, This album is off da chainz!! It is a lot better than people have made it out to be. When I bought, I thought it would be average. But almost every song on the album could be a hit. My personal favorites are Gatman & Robin (Eminem & 50 come strong on this track. Bangin Beat), A Baltimore Love Thing (I think is the best song. Some deep sh--), My Toy Soldier (hard beat. tony yayo & 50 kill it), and Hate It Or Love IT (remix)(G Unit is fire on this track. great way to close). Overall, this album is fire. Not up to par with Get Rich Or Die Tryin', but it is still one of the top albums of the year.
B000002J03|5.0|The album that solidified Led Zeppelin's 'supergroup' status was released in October 1969, within a year of their stunning debut. Most bands take three or four albums to find their maturity and trademark sound, but Zeppelin were different, special. LZ II, nicknamed \\"the brown bomber\\" for its brown cover and monsterous sound crushed the sixties under its massive power. The tracks need little description here as they are wellknown to any self-respecting rock fan. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" was their first anthem and eventual concert closer incorporating medleys of the band's favorite oldtime rock and blues numbers but here on the lp it is dominated by Page's spacey effects and classic guitar solo. The real power of this song though is the intro. You hear a faint almost hiccup, then the guitar riff, followed by the bass, Plant's crooning \\"You need coolin'\\" and then right before the chorus, the greatest drummer in the history of rock makes his appearence. It still sends chills up my spine! Other faves include \\"Heartbreaker\\"(my personal favorite), \\"Thank You\\" which I should have had played at my wedding and \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\", a great example of the diversity of Zep's sound, light and shade. \\"Lemon Song\\" and \\"Bring It on Home\\" two of Zep's many \\"adaptations\\" of classic blues are also highlights of improvisation and a flexing of the muscles so to speak. \\"Ramble On\\" would feature Plant's early excursion into Tolkein's mythology and another representation of what Zeppelin was all about, not just hard rock and metal but all aspects of great music period. One weak point in my opinion is \\"Living Loving Maid\\" which is just filler in my humble opinion and that wouldn't bother me so much but radio stations play both \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Maid\\" back-to- back, due to the short lag time between the two consecutive tracks. \\"HB\\" is an elite track and \\"Maid\\" is most definitley not! Anyway, LZ II has been in my record/CD collection for over twenty years now and I still love it, myfavorite album next to \\"Graffiti\\". Now dig out those old headphones, crank up the stereo and be prepared to be amazed!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This had to be one of the funniest movies of all time. On my list of comedy this is up on the top. I dont care what other people might say about this movie sucking. I say screw them, they dont know what comedy is.When I first head about this movie I have never heard about it. Some of my friends saw it and said they couldn't stop laughing. I saw it they were right. I couldn't stop laughing. If you dont get this movie you are an idiot
B0007O38F8|4.0|The massacre has many great songs on it. Candy Shop, Disco Inferno, and Gunz Come Out are all great tracks and Hate it or Love It is, in my mind, the ebst song since 2003 if not earlier. The other songs are just good not great.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I normally don't write review about movies, but this one has got me so upset. It was a waste of time to watch it, as it has no plot, not funny, doesn't make any sense. Whoever gives 5 stars rating for this movie must be lying, or need to check their heads. From the beginning of the movie to the end, it was so boring, jokes were not really jokes. In fact, to me it is more like making fun of the Japanese culture and the Japanese people. Oh, we are Americans, we come to Japan, we see your city is crowded, hotel room is too small, shower is too short, walk around I get bumped into a cabinet, my toe turned black but Japanese love black toe, we see doctor for that, don't need to fill out any form at the hospital. Or go to strip club, watch strippers tease and comment them as they were learning how to dance. Or go to restaurant, make an order, but demand a beer, and the food was terrible. Turn on the TV, nothing but some crappy kiddy shows. Japanese teenagers look stupid and play kiddy games. Singer or band from America that really don't know how to sing, but the Japanese love them. Why do Japanese exercise, work out in the pool? Why don't they just jump in and swim like me? Or visit temple, but have no feeling like Japan doesn't have church. Firealarm goes off at midnight while people at sleep like it never happend in America. Every scene in the movie is about insulting Japanese. 5 stars rating must be meant for a movie made to disrespect the Japanese people and their culture. Very upset customer.
B0000024RQ|3.0|Bob has pretty well buried \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" these days, and \\"A Hard Rains...\\" not as great as I was hoping that it would be. This is, for me, the hardest Dylan album to listen to. How could it be great when it gets to its climax about Taylor and Burton? A little too optimistic, and a little too cute to be cool. \\"Masters of War\\" scared me, and I don't even know where that came from. \\"Don't Think Twice...\\" is a great tune, but it doesn't fit in with something like \\"Chimes of Freedom\\", which wasn't as great a song as it should have been. Again, there is intrusive harmonica and the bellowing vocal powerhouse of its creator, so it hardly sounds different than the rest. Although as he matured, his songwriting hit a creative and stimulating peak, which was a few years in the future at the time of this release. Check it out, but don't expect HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED.
B0006399FS|4.0|This is a good u2 album. Don't pay attention to the people writing a whole essay of how U2 are sell outs and that there legacy is over on their review. I agree its not there best but some of these reviews that take shots at bono just cause hes on top are incredibly humorous.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time today and I loved it. This is the first time I've sat through an entire movie without so much as blinking. Definatly better than The Matrix.<br /><br />For the record, I liked the battle over the puppy.
0761536434|4.0|This book is really amazing, a must read for videogames fan or not. Talks its history since the first pinball machines that leads to the videogames industry, from Pong to GTA... <br />I only don't give 5 stars because it don't have much photos...I really don't want a kid book, but adding photos in a book like this is essential because not all the people knows how the machines looked liked on the past. <br />This problem can be solved by buying the package listed below with The Illustrated History by Russel Demaria and Johny Wilson... <br />Thanks Steve L. Kent for this great book and I am waiting the next edition, since the Xbox is only mentioned, without a big cover...
B00005T7I1|4.0|In 1930s Chicago, gangsters were running things, running crime and the only man who can bring these gansters to justice is \\"DICK TRACY\\" Directed ,Produced by and starring Warren Beatty as the legendary comic strip detective hero in the yellow coat and hat that began his comic strip in 1931, starring Madonna as seductress Breathless Mahoney, Al Pacino as mob boss Big Boy Caprice, Dustin Hoffman as gangster Mumbles and Charlie Korsmo as orphan Kid(Dick Tracy, Jr.). Dick Tracy is a fun entertaining crime movie that truly brings out the 1930s and the golden age of comics. Beatty and Pacino are terrific, Pacino recieved an oscar nomination. A great detective film noir film for all ages. Very colorful setting and great makeup. The best comic strip film since \\"FLASH GORDON\\" and Superman: the Movie\\" a classic character in a classic film. If you want an entertaining detective film see the legendary detective of all \\"DICK TRACY\\"  \\"I'm on My Way\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|I hope you're enjoying life in Hell. While you're there, why don't you go ahead and slit your wrists, so the rest of the world can be relieved of your pitiable existance. Let me tell you something son, being a grindcore fan-boy does not make you anthying other than the depressed, self-loathing weakling that you are. I really hate to come down so hard on you, because I know that if I met you in person you'd be the most insecure, pimply-faced loser I've ever seen. From your 'review' of U2's CD, it is obvious to me that your either under 14 or are seriously retarded for your age. Your knowledge of U2 goes as far as 'Vertigo', so don't believe for a second that anyone takes your review seriously.  <br />  And for those who think U2 is music for Bush supporters and soccer moms, my advice to you is to get a clue as to who the hell Bono is. If you heard him use the F-word at the 2003 Grammy's, that was nothing. You should have seen how stoned he was during the 1993 Grammy's when every other word out of his mouth had to be censored. I'm sure all the soccer moms were just loving that. And I bet Bush really admires U2's writing a song about masturbation, support and involvment in Greenpeace (an ecologically-driven 'terror' organization), Bono's stripping nude in a London restaurant, and his giving out free condoms at a concert being held at a venue owned by a Catholic organization. Before giving out condoms that night, he made a sarcastic speech saying 'There will be no sales of condoms in here tonight! The young people will not be delivered to the gates of hell in a latex jacket! AIDS? It's not their problem. No homos are here tonight! Not a willie in sight! Just abstentious, castrated, happily married families are here tonight!' Although Bono does not act this way very much now, frankly I think that it's great that his maturity level reflects his age, unlike so many others.
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|Well, it started in 1995, when Michael released HIStory: Past, Present, & Future-Book 1. It was a double album which consisted one disc with 15 hits and the other disc being a new album. The problem with that compilation was that the new album was overbloated with ego, anger, childhood issues, and depression. It was a disappointment to both critics and fans. Not only that, the disc with the hits seemed shoddy. The collection, as a whole, was flooded with overindulgence and flaws. Then, in 2003, Michael released another compilation, Number Ones, which consisted 18 of his #1 hits. The problems with that collection was that most of the tracks were edited and it was still incomplete, missing some key tracks like the Paul McCartney duet, \\"Say, Say, Say\\" or even \\"She's Out Of My Life\\". Now, we finally get the box set we've been waiting for a long time to be released. The Ultimate Collection is a mammoth 4-CD and 1 DVD set with hits, rarities, and demos. I will begin by saying that this whole package is a little out of place. It begins at the Jackson Five period, with the hits, \\"I Want You Back\\", the bubblegum pop classic, \\"ABC\\", \\"I'll Be There\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\". The first disc then delves into the period where his maturity evolves with songs like \\"Dancing Machine\\", \\"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), and \\"Enjoy Yourself\\". Then it goes to the Off The Wall period, which was his breakthrough project with the hits, \\"Rock With You\\", \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\", and \\"She's Out Of My Life\\". The disc also includes unheard demos like the funky, \\"Sunset Driver\\". The first disc seems to be the only disc in this collection that is not really flawed. This set starts to go downhill with the second disc which covers the Thriller period, which was, and still is a milestone in popular music. The album is the best-selling record of all-time, but the tracks that were on that album, included on the second disc, seems pretty spotty because there are only six tracks fromthe album. The disc has tracks like the thundering, \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", the funky, \\"Thriller\\", the rocking, \\"Beat It\\", and the career-defining jam, \\"Billie Jean\\". The disc also includes P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing), which is included here as a demo version and it sounds pretty different from the original version off of the Thriller album. The thing that really makes this disc spotty are the rarities like \\"Someone In The Dark\\" from the E.T Storybook and \\"Scared Of The Moon\\". On the third disc, the Bad period is covered along with the uneven, yet ambitious Dangerous album. On the fourth disc, the HIStory and Invincible projects are covered. On the last two discs, there are so many rarities, demos, and hard-to-find material, that eclipse some of the missing key tracks those albums featured. On the fourth disc, there are two new recordings that sound like the material from Invincible which are \\"The Way You Love Me\\" and \\"We've Had Enough\\". I found it very strange that Mike included a DVD containing the 1992 Dangerous concert that was shot in Bucharest. The DVD is an utterly waste and he could've used the fifth disc as a collection of rarities, demos, and hard-to-find material.<br /><br />  Overall, The Ultimate Collection is a package that could've been better, but it's a good effort. Most of the rarities seem interesting, but some of them make the discs very puzzling to finish and listen to. The DVD that consists the Dangerous concert is disappointing. The booklet is skimpy, offering a very brief and incomplete essay on his career, a poorly detailed timeline, and many rare pictures. The Ultimate Collection does a great job covering periods of his career, but don't think of it as a \\"definitive\\" compilation becuase it just isn't; and casual fans shouldn't come near it. C+
B000059XY7|5.0|After the sudden death of Christopher Reeves a couple of months <br />ago, its only fitting that I review this movie. Christopher <br />Reeve was a legend in my book , and thats good enough for <br />everybody. True Reeves wasnt in a lot of movies, but the few <br />movies he has been in, made an impact in Hollywood and for <br />movies in general, just look at Superman. <br /> <br />Superman stands out as one of the best movies he did and it <br />stands out as an awesome comic remake. <br /> <br />The story really doesnt need a review, Gene Hackman plays <br />Lex Luthor , Superman's main enemy and he hatches <br />a scheme to attack him and conquer the world. Superman <br />stops him but not before beginning a great friendship <br />with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). <br /> <br />Kidder was also at the peak or her acting career here, she] <br />was great, <br /> <br />The effects, the music, Superman was not only a big hit <br />but just a stellar piece of filmmaking. <br /> <br />Its great now that the film has now been on DVD, but now <br />with Reeve's death we must honor his name and what better <br />way to do it, besides giving money to his charities <br />than to sit down and discuss his movies. <br />
B0007O38F8|1.0|I consider myself, and all others that know me would call me a \\"true\\" hip-hop aficionado, so I am able to know good true hip hop, to what is bad hip hop, to what is not hip hop. This album is not hip hop in any way, shape or form. Now most would call me a hater, and that is something that I have come to accept because I look at hip hop from a totally different perspective than most. For one, this album does nothing for the forward progression and resurrection of the art of hip hop, it's actually regressing and sending it into a state of further depression. This album lacks any depth, concept, or point. 50's vacuous lyrics, constant rants of how shiny his rims are, how much money and shine he has, how he robs people, and yadda yadda yadda makes as much sense as Ray Charles buying a new pair of reading glasses. I have never been more upset listening to something in my life. I wouldn't even call this music. This album is doing nothing but digging us further into a state of ignorant bliss that we won't be getting out of for a while. Such a shame that such good production was wasted on such meaningless garbage lyrics. They aren't even lyrics. This album was the biggest waste of time in my life. As El-P from Company Flow said \\"I'd rather be mouth f***ed by Nazis unconscious\\" before I listen to this. Amazon, you need to come up with a new rating systems that includes negatives. Hip Hop is dying because of albums and artists like 50.
0446677450|5.0|After reading several negative messages about this book, I have noticed one common theme: The book doesn't tell me how to do anything. Post Script: It's not a how-to book, and you cannot expect to be spoon-fed. The book takes shots at the traditional way of success and opens the reader up to the thought process of a wealthy man, Kiyosaki. The reason that he does not delve into the details of his deals is that every investor has their own motives, and that he does not focus on short term, transactional business. If you want some out-dated information, go pick up a how-to book 10 years after it was published...Kiyosaki's message helps the long term investor in search of residual, sustainable income. So if you're looking to buy low today, sell high tomorrow, go elsewhere.  <br /> <br />Kiyosaki does a wonderful job of relaying his message that those who are wealthy have put themselves in that position by educating themselves, developing a Wealth Mentality and thinking for themselves, not waiting for the next book to tell them how to do it.  Bottom line is this - find a rich dad, and he can help you with the how to part.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day. what a joke. <br /> <br />even thought I think green day is untalented just like any other pop punk band, atleast you could listen to dookie once or twice before it got old.  but this stuff sucks. <br /> <br />Modern music has got so bad recently, anything looks good now. <br /> <br />another note, this is not punk. <br />1 last note, they are trying to cash on on the latest \\"i hate america\\" trend. <br /> <br />You fools are buying it.  So i guess the title is right, american's are IDIOTS
B0001NBMBC|3.0|First off, in my opinion this album cannot compare old Slipknot releases mate feed kill repeat, self titled, and Iowa. Compared to those albums this is complete garbage. Slipknot sells out apprehensivley on this album, they are now advertised on MTV which is a very bad thing. This album is ok, some good songs are Before I Forget, Pulse of the Maggots, Three Nil, and Vermillion part two. If you are more into Slipknot's old stuff, I recommend Hatebreed, if you like Slipknots new stuff buy this.
B00000IL26|5.0|For months, I would constantly read reviews about how great this album is and how it is one of the best Blue Note albums of all time.  Since I wanted to find out what all the fuss was about, I picked up this cd last summer.  Let me just say that after hearing the opening groove of the title track, you will find yourself snapping your fingers and tapping your feet.  Though I personally prefer \\"Search for the New Land\\", this album definitely qualifies as one of Lee's best.  He is joined by the spectacular Joe Henderson on tenor (the two work really well together), Barry Harris on piano, Bob Cranshaw on bass, and Billy Higgins on drums.  The group is consistently tight and swings hard on all five of the tracks.  After the catchy, funky groove of the title track, the album gets more straight ahead starting with \\"Totem Pole\\", which is my personal favorite of the tracks found on this cd.  Joe Henderson's solo on this track is definitely one of the best tenor solos I've ever heard, which really says a lot.  The rest of the tracks (\\"Gary's Notebook, \\"Boy, What a Night\\", and \\"Hocus-Pocus\\") are all up-tempo swingers with great solos by all, especially Morgan and Henderson.  This is another one of those cds that deserves every good thing said about it, so if you're a Morgan fan, liked his work on Coltrane's \\"Blue Train\\", or just love good jazz, then order this right now if you don't already own it!
B00025ETIW|5.0|MCR is not that new to me but I decided to not buy the album at first. Then I heard Helena and I figured that I liked it alot. i went to Sam Goody and they had it on sale for 12.99 and I bought it. I have to say I am impressed with the lyrics. They are catchy,slick and they are in ways deep. You can tell that they werent just words on a paper. I was very impressed by it all in general. It was better than I expected and it closes on a nice note. I have to say that it is one of the best cds I own and MCR definitely has me addicted. I cant wait to see what they have in store for the future, Three cheers for sweet revenge is Great!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I loves this movie it was way better thant Van Helsing and truly was a great film. I was kind of disapointed that the vampires didnt kick enough but. Viktor was the only one that rocked. I just dont see how the almost won the war when the lycans kicked so much but oh well. N e way the sequel Underworl Evolution is coming out later this year its when Marcus becomes half and half and the lycans and vampires become hunted!!!!!
068987474X|4.0|Ok, read this book before you go out and start to date.  I like this book from the perspective that before you get invested with the guy watch how the treats you.  Now once again, do not get invested with a guy until you see how he treats you. This book suggests you deserve someone that will treat you the way you want to be treated.  Do not settle for less.<br /><br />It is a little cold hearted, but I think for the most part this book might save you some anguish. This book almost employs the tough love approach.  You can not work from the perspective that you can make someone into the person that you want them to be, but if they do not match your standards move on, immediately.<br /><br />Once again this book isn't about forming deep and meaningful relationships, but should really be a way to cull through the men in your life, and finding your keepers.  Its a quick read, but worthwhile.  A good book on relationships and those dynamics is Make Up, Don't Break Up by Dr. Bonnie Eaker Weil.
B0002KVUKW|2.0|I am a huge vampire fan but this movie was a huge disapointment. When i saw this movie @ walmart i thought wow all my favorite horror monsters in one movie. And when i saw it i laughed. The only good part is the werewolves because they were the only thing that wasnt retared (vampires) or over dramatic (frankinstine). Kate beckinsale was good in this but if you want a good werewolf vampire movie get Kate's other vampire movie Underworld were she plays a vampire it is a great movie!!!!!!
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Ingmar Bergman is one of few directors who have won universal acclaim for non-english-spoken features.<br /><br />His PERSONA 1966 is 1 of his most complex productions  and showcases two brilliant performances from Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson - long active in his \\"reportary company\\"...<br /><br />What is stunning with Bergman is that he dares to let us get into the soul of his protagonists, even their duller and boring sides... Their long conversations, inner dialogue and soliliques are a Bergman trademark.<br /><br />Mr Bergman and the characters of his films are easy to identify yourself with because he deals with the inner strength, turmoils and angst of the human being. \\"Persona\\" is no exception:-)
B0007GAEW6|5.0|These fellas from El Paso, TX, did it. They were able to accomplish the perfect blend between indie (space) rock and prog rock. Listening to Mars Volta's \\"Frances The Mute\\" brings to mind Godspeed you Black Emperor and Porcupine Tree at the same time. They blend the darkness of the two, combining the grandeur, elaborate pieces and development of instruments around a theme of Godspeed, with the virtuosity, change of tempo and lyrical splendor of Porcupine Tree. At times, I even get a sense of Rush, specially due to the occasional resemblance of the vocalist to Geddy Lee. The result is an album that leaves you wanting to listen to it a thousand times, so you can dissect the many musical avenues they've left behind for you to walk through.<br /><br />I will be listening to more of Mars Volta in the coming months, I am sure of that. But so far, my favorite track is \\"L' Via L' Viaquez\\" and the multi-part, monster piece \\"Cassandra Gemini\\". Certainly for a lover of good old prog rock (Yes, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Genesis), Mars Volta comes like a breath of fresh (though dark) air over this aged genre that sometimes has such a hard time picking up new steam. With \\"Frances the Mute\\" we're in front, not just a great prog/indie rock album, but also one of the most interesting efforts of 2005. That said, and in case it's not obvious by now, I wouldn't recommend the album for all people. It's certainly a tough one to digest at some points, but if you've been able to enjoy music from Godspeed and/or King Crimson in the past, you will be delighted by Mars Volta's 2005 album.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn is a erotic AND boyish challenge as Robin Hood - no wonder Lady Marian and his men are following him. Errol is magnetic and has a charm that has not dated a bit. Nor has  Olivia deHavilland, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains and Eugene Pallette - all at the best of their powers.<br /><br />The production is of such standard that a remake or further films are of no use.
B00005A46T|5.0|With the release of IOWA, their second album on Roadrunner Records, they played to sold-out venues and headlined overseas tours, all with next to no radio play. IOWA is a 14-track blend of black metal elements, mixed with melodic singing by Corey, and blast beats courtesy of drummer Joey Jordison, and guitarists Mick Thomson and Jim Root. Most of the songs on this album are very heavy, which shows a darker side to SlipKnoT, different from the self-titled album. Much more Industrial metal and Thrash metal influences than on their selftitled. They kicked up the intensity for the entire genre of Nu-Metal with this album. There are no stand out tracks because there are no weak links.<br /><br />1. (515) - 5/5<br /><br />2. People=S**t - 5/5<br /><br />3. Disasterpiece - 5/5<br /><br />4. My Plague - 5/5<br /><br />5. Everything Ends - 5/5<br /><br />6. The Heretic Anthem - 5/5<br /><br />7. Gently - 4/5<br /><br />8. Left Behind - 5/5<br /><br />9. The Shape - 5/5<br /><br />10. I Am Hated - 5/5<br /><br />11. Skin Ticket - 4/5<br /><br />12. New Abortion - 5/5<br /><br />13. Metabolic - 4/5<br /><br />14. Iowa - 5/5<br /><br />While Slipknot is not the heaviest or the most talented band, they still deliver in the fact that they put alot of emotion and passion into their songs. With the brutality of thrash, the angst of grunge, the sci-fi sounds of industrial, and the groove of rap and hip hop, Slipknot has created a very enjoyable album, and I recommend this to the more open minded metalhead or fans of true Nu-Metal.
B00009W0WM|5.0|CASABLANCA is a GOOD movie and is fast-paced and just happens to be right on target. No discussion is necessary. The script, cast and crew did a marvellous job. No question about it. Bergman is a revelation; she`s so youthful, fresh and her excitement and naturalness is a pleasure to behold.
B00000JCOV|5.0|What do you get when you have an expiramental/fusion metal group who get a hold of KoRn's simplistic style and fuse it to their own? A 9 member metal band named Slipknot. KoRn may have started Nu-Metal, but Slipknot established and legitimized the genre and gave a blue print to the future Nu-Metal bands (ala MuDvAyNe, Mushroomhead)who would evolve this sound to it's extreme limits. No Nu-Metal is known for its' simple guitar parts, groovy bass lines, and normally simple drumming, but Slipknot took a little bit more influence from metal instead of rap, and played a double bass drum. They also utilized the hardcore screams of frontman #8 Corey, and showed their Slayer influence by using mostly screaming throughout the entire album. Born of the near-desolation of Iowa, Slipknot burst forth from the heartland in 1999 with some of the most awe-inspiring, cathartic rock the world had ever heard. Vetting their collective psyche not only through their songs, but also through their masks, their uniforms, their live shows, and even their fans and the culture they inhabit, Slipknot hold nothing back. The depth of their expression is matched by that of their musical prowess- this tornado is laser-guided, and fellow musicians, critics and the fans know that Slipknot is deadly serious about it's art. Many \\"metal elitists\\" will hate this, but for more opened minded metal heads who listen to every genre of metal, you might want to check this band out. Not the best, not the heaviest, not the most brutal, and not the most talented band on earth, but you can see the emotion they put into it. An overall great listen.
B00003CXRM|5.0|T-Bone Burnett pays loving homage to American '30s folk styles--blues, gospel, bluegrass, jazz, and more..and this is a total joy!  George Clooney is a joy to watch as the thinker among a group of morons in this oddity.   Would Homer be insulted by this?  Seriously, this is a very different movie, but very good.  I wouldn't be surprised if this picture already has a cult following, much like \\"Harold and Maude\\" does.   <br /> <br />The soundtrack to this film would be very good, I think. :)
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is without a shadow of a doubt Slayer's best, and most influencial album to date. Reign In Blood is darkness unchecked, stripped of bombast and pretense, songs averaging barely two minutes in length but never failing to nail you to your seat. From the opening track to the closing, this album is the equivilant of a trainwreck. It just hits hard and never lets up till the end, and by then you're like, wow what just happened, and you can't wait to do again. This is a rollercoaster of an album. Reign in Blood is Slayer's undisputed masterpiece, a brief (under half an hour) but relentless onslaught that instantly obliterates anything in its path and clears out just as quickly. Producer Rick Rubin gives the band a clear, punchy sound for the first time in its career, and they largely discard the extended pieces of Hell Awaits in favor of lean assaults somewhat reminiscent of hardcore punk (though distinctly metallic and much more technically demanding). Reign in Blood opens and closes with slightly longer tracks whose slower riffs offer most of the album's few hints of melody. are no breaks, no pauses, no power ballads to ease the seething tension between one track and the next. The album almost single-handedly inspired the entire death metal genre and unlike many of its imitators, it never crosses the line into self-parodic overkill. Reign in Blood was a stone-cold classic upon its release, and it hasn't lost an ounce of its power today. This is no question a must have!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|i've always loved gilmore girls its a show i've been watching for the last 5 seasons when i see a dvd coming out i am the first one in line, or when it is coming on i just set my tv to the channel that its on. this show is just heart warmed and just the number 1 show that i've ever seen to the casts i hope you all keep up the good work keep them dvds coming i can't wait to get the new complete third season in may i'm marking it down on my calender.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|After M.F.K.R., Self-Titled, and IOWA, they have redefined themselves again by releasing there most musical accomplishment, more technical guitar playing, but at the same time they lost quite a bit of what little heaviness they had. However they makeup for it with better song writing, lyrics, and more emotional side of Slipknot then what we've seen before. Gone are all the swear words and heavily influenced Industrial and Thrash sound to a more normal heavymetal and gruge influenced sound, but some industrial and thrash influences still exist. My personal fav. track is Pulse of the Maggots.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|In The Zone, Britney's fourth studio album is with a doubt her best album. Praised by the majority of critics and fans alike, In The Zone has a more sensual and grown-up feel. Some may say it's \\"overtly sexual,\\" but I think it just shows Britney growth process and her exploring her sexuality. Some songs do push the envelope but I think she does it in a tasteful way. Madonna was far more blatant and sexually (I still love her too though!). In fact, I would go as far as say that Britney's \\"sexual\\" tracks are the more musically astounding tracks (such as Touch of My Hand and Breathe one Me). I would recommend In The Zone to anyone who is into Pop music, although it's evident that Britney tried to explore different kinds of genres. The Bonus tracks are also worthwhile too.
0393035158|5.0|Courageous to write in this current atmosphere with rise of social conservatives based on \\"American Christian Values\\". If you are a Christian or Muslim. You will find this book difficult to stomach.  <br /> <br />    In your face writing. Very direct and Blunt \\"Theology is an extension of human Ignorance\\", articulate and easy to read. States his position clearly and argues his point well. This is an attack on Monotheistic Religions - primarily Judeo-Christian religions (Islam, Judaism and Christianity) throughout the world. He makes a compelling case that we cannot grow into a more civilized society unless we shed our primitive and illogical believe systems.  <br /> <br />     Highly recommended reading. I thought his analysis of our illogical religious views and related actions were right on, although I did not agree completely with him on all his points, it stimulated me to think and rethink some of my positions. If you have strong liberal or conservative views, your position will be challenged. He is an independent thinker and he is not going to feed you what you want to hear. This is what a good book should do. Important and relevant book and we need more books like this. Thus the five stars. <br /> <br />    Loaded with memorable quotes. I found myself re-reading sections and sentences and then close the book and stare in space as I comprehend a new idea.  <br /> <br />   Some of the criticism here in Amazon review is fair. He does come across as an \\"atheist fundamentalist\\" as one reviewer wrote. Sam Harris rightly criticizes needless wars in the name of promoting religion, but he seems to promote wars in the name of fighting religion. I find this a bit hypocritical. I am not sure he is any better than the religious zealots he criticizes.  <br /> <br />  Where I take exception and I feel his argument is the weakest, is his that He is too forgiving on the nature of \\"intent\\" and war itself as being justified to fight ignorance. In his view, we (the US) at war aremore humane than Islam at war because of our \\"intent\\". We do not intend to kill innocents (they are collateral), where as Islamic people at war do. I think this is a narrow definition of intent and too forgiving. War by its nature is inhumane regardless of intent. And whether your loved one was killed intentionally or not, it doesn't make it any easier to accept or any more justifiable or make you more rightous. In addition, collateral damage is acceptable as long as it is the other side that is experiencing it. If for example, the Iraqi resistance was able to reach our shores and retaliate, and caused collateral damage of US citizens, then our view of the war and our interest in ending it sooner will rise. So what is the morality of the war? Also, if collateral damage is more humane than targeting civilians intentionally, then no civilian deaths is more humane than collateral damage. We should be rising to the occasion (or evolving) where wars are no longer legitimate.  When the US is able to keep its citizenry detached from the reality of the war, it causes prolonged suffering of the other side.  Also Harris does not address \\"cause and effect\\" and \\"ends justify the means\\" foreign policy. Don't we need to be held accountable for our actions? But the US has more at its disposal than military. It is the intent of the US to use its economic might to keep nations in poverty. He does not address this...Recommended reading \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" <br /> <br />    He leaves the impression that he only reason Islamic terrorists are attacking us is for religious reasons only and they are  stuck in the 14th century beyond any sense of reasoning. The Koran is rooted in violence and justifies them attacking us - The infidels. As a result, the only remedy is to wage a war (with justifiable collateral damage) against Islam.  I think he goes too far here. The Koran explains their hideous actions, but not their real motives. I think he underestimates there is a realwar against the west based on what we do, not what we believe. After all, there are no terrorist attacks in South America, Canada, Japan, Eastern Europe or Australia. Yet they are all Infidels. The US and Western Europe have a long history in the Middle East of occupation, puppet governments, support for Israel, military intervention and oil interests that cannot be discounted as the reason. Now the war in Iraq has given the terrorist more reason to hate us. He gives the impression that the war on terror can only be won militarily through war. I agree the military has a role to play, but it is not enough. He does not adequately address other factors in combination with the military action; cultural change in the Middle East and a change in US foreign policy. Recommended Reading; Imperial Hubris Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror.  <br /> <br />     In place of religion, Harris proposes a Buddhist view of life. He does not go into detail on Buddhism but touches briefly on some of its tenets with regard to reason, logic, our thoughts and consciousness. For the intellectually curious, he may inspire you to learn more about this relatively unknown religion.  <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In The Zone, Britney's fourth studio album, is by far her best. I like Britney as a performer and I think she really breaks away from conventional styles in the music industry, but I must say her first two albums weren't that memorable, with the exception of some catchy tunes. It wasn't until Britney's third album did she start to grab my attention. In The Zone is even better. It's obvious she's exploring different musical genres and she does it in a subtle way and still maintains her own image. The album as a whole is more sensual as most people have labeled it, but I personal think it's done very tastefully. Madonna was far more sexual and people learned to accept it as Madonna's image, a sexual icon. In The Zone's more \\"sexual\\" tracks are the ones that are actually more worthwhile ironically. To name a few; Breathe On Me, Touch Of My Hand, (I Got That) Boom Boom are amazing. Some other notable tracks are the ever-so catchy Toxic and the the sweet Everytime. This album was praised by the majority of critics and fans alike, and there's a good reason why...
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually is one of the better romantic comedies to come out in recent years.  The concept of interlocking love stories is relatively fresh, though not totally unique.  In this case it is will done, and Richard Curtis deserves credit for working in platonic love (i.e., between friends) and love ending as well as stories of new and unrequited love.  The film moves along quickly and has enough light moments that it will be entertaining to both male and female viewers, though it has segments that are definately not appropriate for children.<br /><br />Love, Actually is anchored by a stellar cast of true actors such as Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, and Emma Thompson.  Both Thompson and Bill Nighy should have gotten Oscar nominations for two very different roles - Thomson as the wife losing her husband's love, Nighy as a has-been rock star who can't keep his mouth from getting him in trouble.  The cast is deep and clearly was having a good time shooting the film.  Frankly, I am not a Hugh Grant fan and I still liked both the film and the character that he played.<br /><br />The DVD has several special features worth watching, starting with a commentary with several of the stars and the director.  If you listen to it you will find out that Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play the angel of love in the film, but that his role was reduced.  This probably made the film more coherent, but that doesn't alter the fact that his scenes are some of the funniest in the movie.  The deleted scenes, while understandably not in the film, are also worth perusing.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about this film is that it originated the strange idea that Wisconsin is America's romance capital, with one of the characters travelling there on the theory that American girls will find his British accent irresistable (this idea also pops up in The Prince and Me for some reason).  The problem is that he walks into a bar with Anheusuer Busch advertising all over the place, which is blasphemy in the land of Miller beer.  This is a quibbling detail, but will be amusing to the Cheeseheads out there.<br /><br />Overall, the film is entertaining and accessable accross gender lines, and will be worth the money and time spent for an adult audience., which is blasphemy in the land of Miller beer.  This is a quibbling detail, but will be amusing to the Cheeseheads out there. <br /> <br />Overall, the film is entertaining and accessable accross gender lines, and will be worth the money and time spent for an adult audience.
B0007O38F8|1.0|This cd don't even compare to Get Rich Or Die Trying.  He say its better and Tony Yayo say its 10x better than the 1st one too.  That's why all the stuff happened to hype it up like they did the first cd and it worked. But this cd is WEAK so don't waste your time or money.
B000009EUM|5.0|So, after all the euphoria started to die down, as is the way in the sparkly world of pop music, the little girls stopped screaming so loudly and Morten, Mags and Pal finally got around to making a follow up to \\"Hunting High And Low\\".<br /><br />Can still remember the first time I heard the lead single from this album, \\"I've Been Losing You\\", on the radio. The DJ in question, believe it was Radio 1 actually, had been saying how they were going to be playing the as yet unheard new single from a-ha. After the song finished, he began talking and was caught out by the \\"fake\\" ending.<br /><br />This sounded radically different to what I'd heard from a-ha previously. Having been a massive fan of \\"The Sun Always Shine On TV\\", I knew a-ha could turn their hands to symphonic, BIG sounding pop records, but this was a revelation. Morten's voice sounded slightly more hoarse and worn than it had done previously, the track chugged along menacingly, sequenced synths were buried deep within the mix and the drums, well, it sounded like the drums had been turned up to eleven! (copyright Spinal Tap).<br /><br />Yet this new, \\"grown up\\" sound was still balanced by a-ha's pop sensibilities, a cracking melody that allowed Morten's voice to soar over the arrangement. I was hooked.<br /><br />From the moment I bought \\"Scoundrel Days\\" on vinyl, I was awestruck. There are some truly wonderful pop songs and esoteric lyrics to be found on this album. The title track, \\"The Swing Of Things\\", \\"I've Been Losing You\\", \\"Manhattan Skyline\\", \\"The Weight Of The Wind\\", \\"The Soft Rains Of April\\" still sound as fresh and vital to me today as they did in 1986. Although some of the synth pads have dated somewhat (there are Yamaha DX7s all OVER the place) the production still sounds great with plenty of room for the melodies and Morten's ever beautiful voice.<br /><br />The only minor hiccup is Mags' playful \\"Maybe, Maybe\\", which to this day still sounds like a musical joke (\\"Maybe it was OVER when you chucked me out the ROVER at full speed\\", hmmmm).<br /><br />To this day, \\"Scoundrel Days\\" remains one of my favourite albums of all time, a piece ofmusic that really does \\"take you on a journey\\". I remember being 15 years old, listening to it on my walkman headphones as I was in bed at night, the music cunjouring images of landscapes and wide open spaces. Morten's voice on \\"Scoundrel Days\\", the title track as he hits the high note just before the second chorus STILL sends shivers down my spine - \\"And SEEEEEEEEE as our lives are in the making\\"!!!<br /><br />Just buy it. It's bloody brilliant!n you chucked me out the ROVER at full speed\\", hmmmm). <br /> <br />To this day, \\"Scoundrel Days\\" remains one of my favourite albums of all time, a piece ofmusic that really does \\"take you on a journey\\".

038551123X|4.0|This is a very strange book, an interesting mystery, well written in the mystery genre.  The protagonist, or \\"hero,\\" if we can call him that, works as a splatter specialist for the police in Miami.  He is also a serial killer that only kills \\"bad\\" people.  I found the narrative voice extremely disturbing.  This man feels no human emotion or attachment, and goes through life pretending to be human, as he puts it.  He knows how to mimic normal human relationships.  But every now and then, he has to kill someone.  He finds other serial killers to kill.  No matter how much this might make him a sort of \\"good guy,\\" the truth is that it would only be a matter of time before he feels compelled to kill someone else.  I found it just so bleak.  I did not like this hero.  Having said that, I did find the story unusual and a worthy mystery.
B000084T18|2.0|this has average production, lyrics aint good, rapping skills are average too. this album gets tiring to listen to. it sucks if this went diamond and sold of 10 million cause it doesn't deserve to go 1 x platinum. there are much better albums that only went gold you know. <br />listen to the ART OF WAR or EAST 1999 by bone thugs, those guys are talent.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie represents Jim Henson at the zenith of his craft. Filmed in the mid-eighties, it stands the test of time very well, especially compared to the computer graphics-laden fantasies of later years. There is something about the wonderful puppet characters that computer-generated pixels simply can't match. <br /> <br />The plot is rather simple, but that is a plus, not a minus. Jennifer Connelly (in a great pre-Rocketeer role) and David Bowie are excellent, and Bowie's musical soundtrack brings the world of the Labyrinth to life. <br /> <br />There are no real flaws in the movie, it bears multiple viewings very well, and deserves to be recognized as a landmark in the annals of fantasy films. The ending is also superb - unlike many similar movies, it feels \\"right\\". <br /> <br />The DVD presentation is basic, with a few extra features thrown in, but they won't be the reason anyone purchases this film. The reason will be to see a prime example of what the world lost when Jim Henson passed on.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Finally, a movie that does everything right! This is the zombie flick that horror fans have been waiting for. They manage to make the zombies scary without losing the tounge-in-cheek approach to the movie itself. The humor is witty and smart, as is most british comedy, but not as dry as you might expect. I don't want to ruin this for anyone so I won't go into specific details but I will tell you this, I saw this movie 6 times in theaters and bought it the day it came out. I still crack up every time I see it. I also find that when I describe it to people I laugh at just the memory of what I've seen. Don't miss out on seeing one of the best movies of the year. This one is definitely going down as a classic!
0517548232|5.0|This was a pretty good book.  I started at the beginning and kept turning the pages until I got all the way to the end.  That was when I finished it.  I am so proud of myself!investment multipliers, but investment may depend more on the interest rate -- which is why Keynesians insist the demand curve for money is flat; 6) since, after the government deficit spends, there is less money available for private investment, government spending has negative implications for the growth of our capital stock; and 7) it's simply too tempting for Congress to deficit spend even when times are good (as did Bush), a course which, if done too often, will simply increase the national debt and thus, in the long run, increase taxes and impair productivity growth.    Convinced?  Well, unfortunately, Hazlitt doesn't cover any of these quite solid objections and thus, for a book pretending to flog Keynesianism, this volume cannot be accounted useful.  Hazlitt's positions are nowhere near as insightful or as meticulously argued as Friedman's were (whose countertheories hinged chiefly on delineating how changes implemented by the government will come around too little, too late for them to make any difference).  The deepest Hazlitt goes seems to be that \\"spending left and right\\" when you're in a jam seems unnatural to him, inimical to the Protestant work ethic, disanalogous to what you'd do if it were your personal finances, and, well, contrary to all Christian decency!    No, Hazlitt hasn't a tenth of Friedman's wit, depth, or quantitative wherewithal; nor has he anything approaching his writing skill.  (That single paragraph I wrote above has far more depth as a critique of Keynesianism than Hazlitt's entire book does.)  Worst of all, Hazlitt isn't really here to teach you (as the book's title suggests); he's here to convince you - to persuade you that everybody else is wrong and that only he is right, and that the phenomenal (overall) success of the U.S. economy over the past 50 years -- at least as of his writing -- hadn't really happened.    The upshot is that nobody, NOBODY, will get anything out of this book.  Here's why:    1) If you're a rank beginnerat economics, this elliptical, poorly argued, and ineffectively organized book will either mislead or confuse you without teaching you anything substantial or correct.    2) If you're halfway competent at economics, you'll demand mathematical and model-based support for Hazlitt's ideas, all of which is conspicuously missing.    3) If you're really good at economics, this book is so patently wrong, poorly reasoned, petulant, and generally puerile that it's not even worth reading.    Having said all this, I will concede that Hazlitt does come through here and there with occasional flashes of sense (such as in the last few pages, when he talks about Social Security).  However, \\"occasional flashes of sense\\" should hardly be taken as a warm recommendation when we're talking about an economics book.  By this point the standard is a lot higher.    One problem with reviewing this book is that it's taken as almost sacred, almost off-limits by certain people, mainly libertarians and Austrians.  It's like they refuse to engage it on the level of ideas, and instead resort to ad hominems if Hazlitt's book isn't granted a kaaba-like level of respect (v. comments infra).    There's another book professing to be a one-volume precis of economic principles called \\"Naked Economics.\\"  If you're coming to Hazlitt merely to acquire a quick understanding of some basic economic principles or to become economically literate in a big hurry, I would definitely advise you go there instead.  It's everything this book was trying to be.    Also avoid \\"The Armchair Economist.\\"
B00069L0XG|4.0|I really enjoy both of these movies. They are not by any means award winning cinematic achievements, but they weren't supposed to be. The camera angles can be a little distracting and there are more than a couple times you wish the rambling explantions would come to an end, but overall they're very entertaining. The action and suspense is incredible! There were a few times I actually caught myself holding my breath as they made there way through the hive in the first one. The actors all reallly went full throttle with this one. The dialogue, although a little bland at times, feels really genuine coming from the actors. They all seem to believe what they are saying and this pulls you right in with them. All in all, a great movie to snuggle up on the couch and watch (with someone to protect you of course).
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I HAVE ENJOYED WATCHING THIS MOVIE AS IT CONTAINS ALL THE SUCCESFULL ELEMENTS TO PRODUCE A HOROR, TWIST IN THE TALE,THRILLER MOVIE.MANY THANKS TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER AND LOOKING FORWARD THE SECOND EPISODE...
1573921394|5.0|There is no doubt that John Maynard Keynes's \\"The General Theory...\\" was the most important book about economics of the 20th Century.  Hayek and Friedman (and maybe Ludwig von Mises) may be thought of as the great minds among academics and professional economists, but when the economy heads southward and these academics and professionals have to advise politicians, they all mysteriously become Keynesians - Reagan and George W. being the two greatest examples of this hypocrisy, as both presidents and their economic advisors were Keynes-bashers, yet both have been the most Keynesian presidents in American history. <br /> <br />Indeed, nothing makes a person's point better than watching his or her detractors quietly subscribe to the new principles. <br /> <br />The book is almost unbearable to read.  There is not a lot of mathematics - a basic algebra course and the ability to think deeply and critically will suffice.  But, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the sentence structures are quite frightening, and the ability to follow along with what Lord Keynes explains can seem almost impossible at times.  You will end up reading the book several times, as some pages, paragraphs, and even chapters require rereading to understand - Keynes, shockingly, is no Paul Krugman in terms of being able to write for the masses. <br /> <br />But, if you can work beyond all of that, it is a worthwhile read.  (If you want a Keynes book that is easy to read and structured more to the casual reader, I recommend \\"The Economics Consequences of the Peace\\" - and don't let the title scare you.) <br /> <br />Conservatives call him a Marxist; Marxists call him a Conservative; Liberals can't decide if he's the Second Coming of Christ or a Plague to be avoided; and Libertarians think he's Satan.  And anyone who can stir up such an ideological mess deserves his place in history.

Thank you Les Monsieurs Aimard and Harnoncourt for your hard and successful work in making these pieces sound new again. <br /> <br />The Master Beethoven's Piano Concerti have just come out of the shower...They are clean, fresh, and alive again!
B000683VI4|5.0|I don't know why I bought this DVD. I had never heard about it but the \\"most romantic\\" tag on the sleeve probably did it. I am here to tell you that it is a stunning film that reminds you of what human love is possible of achieving. And that means what we all are capable of achieving. This is a film for the soul. Just see it!

B0007OY2MG|5.0|I don't know what it is about the third seasons of my all time favorite television shows. Their third years always seem to be one of their best, if not THE best, season of the series. And this one is no exception. By this time, Gilmore Girls has grown to be one of the more accomplished, sophisticated, witty, clever, and intelligent pieces of work on television. I am constantly amazed with every episode with the magnitude of clever writing, humor, and top of the line acting. Amy Sherman-Palladino is a writer/director of immense talent, and I am still thrilled to this day that she has given us the wonderful gift of the girls. Season 3 is, in my opinion, the best season of the show yet. Filled with the colorful characters and stories that have cemented the series' reputation, season 3 delivers in all areas. Season 3 contains many of the show's top best episodes to date. The season starts off with \\"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days\\", a sunny opener. Rory's college future is first taken on in the third episode, the hysterical \\"Application Anxiety\\". One of the best episodes is \\"They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?\\", a dazzling episode that sees Lorelei and Rory participating in the town's dance-a-thon, but things go bad when the ongoing Dean/Jess rivalry comes to a head. Fantastic. \\"Let The Games Begin\\" is a hilarious elder Gilmore centered episode that puts Rory's future college plans into question. The holidays come into play with the wonderful \\"A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving\\", where the girls are invited to 4 different Thanksgiving dinners. Lorelei's backstory comes into play in the teriffic \\"Dear Emily And Richard\\", a flashback rich episode that shows a young Lorelei getting pregnant with Rory, and the rift between her and her parents when she goes into labor. Old beau Max Medina comes back into Lor's life in the unforgettable \\"Keg! Max!\\", which also has a slamming party that causes mayhem for Rory and Lane. The character of Jess caused a lot of great mayhem with other characters, but was always a one note, one sided character himself with no real story for being the way he is. He was on book smart level with Rory, but other than that, they didn't have anything in common and were wrong for each other. Jess' departure starts in \\"Say Goodnight, Gracie\\", when his dad shows up, and completely leaves in \\"Here Comes The Son\\", which was supposed to set up his own spin-off, which never happened. The season ends with one of the shows' greatest finales, \\"Those Are Strings, Pinocchio\\", which sees Rory graduate from Chilton. It was a monumental and classic episode to go out on. One of the best. There is plenty more to relish in these 22 episodes, and those are just the tip of the iceberg. Other great pleasures include \\"The Big One\\", which includes a hilarious after sex talk between Paris and Rory. \\"One's Got Class & The Other One Dyes\\" is classic Gilmore, and it has Lorelei sweating bullets when her past comes into question when giving a talk to a high school class about getting pregnant at 16. The cast continues to shine and show that they are one of the finest and tighest ensembles on television. It continues to be a crime that they, and the show itself, doesn't recogniting from the Emmy's. Lauren Graham becomes more and more amazing with each passing season, and she is definitley one of the best actresses, with one of the best characters, on TV at the moment. Alexis Bledel is still the best kid on the tube, and everyone else showcases what a fine ensemble cast should be. The writing is still some of the most amazing on television, and you really need to know your stuff and pop culture to know some of the things they are talking about. Season 3 of Gilmore Girls is top notch, quality television, and it makes you wish that all TV shows could be this good.
0553212478|4.0|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a classic book.  Everyone knows the story line-well at least what they've seen in the movies (which is actually pretty different from the book).  A man creates a \\"monster\\" who is evil.  The most interesting aspect of this book in my opinion is the monster's true personality.  In contrast to the common view of the monster as a cold-blooded killer, he is really compassionate and intelligent, but because he is never accepted in society because of his horrid appearence, his loneliness causes him to go on a killing spree to get revenge against his creator for bringing him into such a cruel world.  This book is an excellent read, but may be somewhat boring to some (I just read it for my senior english class and most of my class hated it!).
B00005JN0T|2.0|Uggghhhh, that is the noise Isaac Asimov is making as he roles over in his grave. This movie tried to be more than what it was and in the process completely destroyed what Asimov had written. This movie is just a bunch of special effects and little wise cracks from Smith, who is just so funny. For what the movie was, it wasn't that bad, but the director should of left it had that, not try to make it seem like anything more. HTe concept of robots showing emotion and man vs machine,it has been done before, and much better (See \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"2001: a Space Odyessy\\"). The whole concept has just been beaten to death and instead of bringing something new to the table and breathing life back into the concept, \\"I,Robot\\" lays it to rest, and then steps on and smashs it some more. For a mindless summer action movie, it is above average, but it tried to be something more hten that, nad it fell flat on its face.
076790592X|3.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a very sweet book about a dying old man giving his last advice to a young man.  The book is very touching, easy to read, and gives a new look on life.  Morrie's advice to Mitch is inspiring.  He explains the beauty of life, peace in death, and need for love.  I would highly recommend this book to people of any age!
B000002UB6|5.0|This is not the last Beatle album, though they could have messed up badly after this one (though the follow up, Abbey Road, is my favourite). Lennon wasn't doing much, he wrote alone 3 of the 12 songs here, and 1 of them isn't a real song (Dig It). Dig A Pony is a fantastic listen, and Across The Universe is one of his most popular songs. Harrison wrote my favourite here, I Me Mine, and one of my favourites, For You Blue. Ringo wasn't doing anything but spectacular drum patterns, and his drums were the last thing to have been ever recorded for a Beatle album. McCartney wrote 3 songs here too, but the 3 are \\"real\\" songs, and all of them were hit singles. <br /> <br />The album opens with the Lennon/McCartney song, Two Of Us, that is really good. Dig A Pony is responsibility of Lennon, and the lyrics make no sense at all, it's a bit too long but it has a nice, heavy riff. Across The Universe is great, too. I Me Mine is my favourite here, credited to Harrison, Phil Spector did a fantastic job with this one. Dig It is a funny song, I like the final words, \\"That was Dig It by Georgie Wood and now we shall play Hark The Angels\\" or something like that, and Let It Be pops in. This version of Let It Be is CRAP. It features the WORST SOLO ever, or quite possibly. The single version of Let It Be was fantastic, featuring a perfect solo. This solo makes the song much worse than even the song with no solo! <br /> <br />Maggie Mae is a nice traditional song with nice harmonies by the Beatles. I've Got A Feeling features the worst McCartney vocal EVER. If he would have stayed with this kind of vocal in Abbey Road, it would have sucked. My least favourite here and quite possibly the worst Beatle song ever. For You Blue features a fantastic slide by Lennon, and this version of Get Back isn't as good as the single, though it featuresa nice Lennon joke at the end. Quite possibly the worst Beatle album, needless to say it gets 5 stars and everyone should have it.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I was a bit hesitant about buying this DVD set at first, feeling like I would only enjoy a small part of this 10 hour+ event (although, as noted by many, that much more music is unfortunately lost). I am so happy I made this purchase!!! I am a big fan of some of the lost footage (i.e.: Led Zepplin reunion, additional Elton John, Neil Young & The Cars music) and would have paid three times the price to have it but this is still incredible entertainment. I am not a big fan of mid-80's music but there is something for everyone on here. Many of the artists are still popular today (it's fun to watch them early in their career).<br /><br />I still can't believe that this incredible set is LESS THAN $30.00!!! AND IT STILL BENEFITS THE RELIEF EFFORT!!!<br /><br />The audio quality is superb and the video is a 4 star picture (which is great for a 20 year old, outdoor, live televised broadcast from 2 continents that was not intended to be recorded and sold).<br /><br />Viewing the emotional, heartbreaking news documentary, the video's of \\"Band Aid\\" and \\"USA for Africa\\" that begin the set and pick a few of your favorite groups are well worth the money. Seeing Freddy Mercury perform is priceless. God Bless Bob Geldof and all the other hard working, dedicated individuals for putting on this event that still means as much today as it did then.<br /><br />THIS IS TRULY A VISUAL AND AUDIO PLEASURE!!!
B000002UB3|5.0|Wow... This is my favourite Beatles album because it has got most of my favourite Beatle songs. Many here get a 10. It's fantastic, life in plastic! The first Beatle album I bought and I am still enjoying it. From the sudden opening in Come Together to the final word sang by McCartney in Her Majesty, you're in for a good time. Considering all the crap that was going on with the band before this album was made (Let It Be, George and Ringo leaving the band, or Paul pissing George off during the recording of Hey Jude and other guitar tracks on his songs), it's unbelievable how come it is so good. Paul was playing better bass, there are solos in nearly every song (thanks to Lennon and George), there are harmonies (Because), and much more. <br /> <br />Come Together - What a great song! From this one you see Lennon was getting heavy inspiration from blues, r&b and music you get to play as background music in clubs (see Yer Blues and I Want You). Lennon's style had completely changed, though this one's still a biggie! 10/10 <br />Something - Great Harrison song, with some great lyrics, but the highlights are the riff, the solo and the bridge. His only number 1 during his Beatle career. 10/10 <br />Maxwell's Silver Hammer - Good, happy song by McCartney though not one I'd listen to unless I'm listening to the album. Funny lyrics. 8.5/10 <br />Oh! Darling - Now Macca becomes serious and writes a wonderful song. Like Lennon's Come Together, this one's like a background song, with the \\"ooh\\"'s accompanying the verse, but it can get a little bit heavy (like his Helter Skelter) during the chorus! 10/10 <br />Octopus's Garden - Ringo's best song and probably my favourite song in this entire album. The best part in this song is Harrison's fantastic solo, accompanied by bubble sounds and Lennon singing in the background, fantastic. 10/10 <br />I Want You (She's So Heavy) - Another favourite. Great riffs and solos played by Lennon, and not exactly \\"deep\\" lyrics but to the point, andthe final instrumental scene with all the Beatles playing some heavy rock up to the peak of the sound mountains, all of them playing together as a band, up to the sudden close in which the sund barrier collapses, just as the sound can't get any louder, was the final recording in Beatle history. FABULOUS! 10/10 <br />Here Comes The Sun - Harrison's calming song comes after the heavy rock in I Want You. Like Something, has a great bridge, and the song gains power as it advances. 10/10 <br />Because - Great calming ballad, though I haven't got a clue of who wrote it, perhaps Lennon, perhaps McCartney, maybe both! 8/10 <br />You Never Give Me Your Money - Starts with the tune I love so much (and wonderfully abused in Carry That Weight) and changes paces all day long, like Lennon's Happiness Is A Warm Gun, to it's funny 1234567 ending. 10/10 <br />Sun King - At first I hated this song, but I love it now. Divided into parts, with the great riff, the happy, dreamy harmonies to when the Sun King (Lennon) arrives and sings some great italian verses. 10/10 <br />Mean Mr. Mustard - Music is revived in this album with Mr. Mustard, and what a great song it is! This song opens the final Beatles medley. 10/10 <br />Polythene Pam - Mustard's sister gets a song too. Featuring great 3 chord progress at the intro and after each verse, and a great solo. 10/10 <br />She Came In Through The Bathroom Window - Okay, I have a big issue with this one. It's too long for the medley, and it is BORING. It closes the first part of the medley. 7.5/10 <br />Golden Slumbers - Great song, and this one (as well as the following tunes) revive the best moments in the album, with all the riffs, openings, closings. Nothing special about this one, but it isn't bad. 8/10 <br />Carry That Weight - Wonderful! After the ballad, Golden Slumbers, comes this one, blasting in with a chorus sang mainly by... Ringo! If you listen closely, the only one you can hear properly is Ringo. Then comes the abuse of the YouNever Give Me Your Money tune, which I love. Amazing. 10/10 <br />The End - Featuring solos by each Beatle, though the silly opening lyrics and singing during the solo bring this song down. 9/10 <br />Her Majesty - Just Paul talking very fast with some nice guitars. Not Rated/10 <br /> <br />What a journey! I love this album. 17 tracks! Wow. Everyone should get this album - The only album I know that I can listen to every song without skiping, dancing, singing and enjoying eveyr song, along with Guns N' Roses' Appetite For Destruction.
B0007O38F8|5.0|50's new album may cause some controversey but it's definetly a keeper. The album was right on target, I bought it the first day of release. I think the tracks/singles taken off the album, already may boost the sales of the album and then, again it may not. Either way 50's still going to be on top and it looks like it's going to be that way for a long, long time. No matter how old he gets he has my money, for he's a talented thug with potential and power.
B000002UAC|5.0|This is a great follow-up to the brilliant Please Please Me, though Please Please Me is better. From the opening cries of It Won't Be Long to the final scream of That's What I Want in Money, you're in for a good time. Features some of the best Beatle songs to be ever recorded, like Lennon's cry of victory in It Won't Be Long, Harrison's writing debut, Don't Bother Me, a spectacular vocal in Chuck Berry's Roll Over Beethoven, and the almost-perfect Not A Second Time featuring quite possibly the best lyrics ever. The rest of the songs are pretty strong, or average. Fabulous album, everyone should have it.
6305159432|1.0|As I have written before, just another one in the absurd Rambo-like string of \\"Bad-Evil-Crazy-Cannibalistic Soviet Bastards Who Are Always There To Bring Tyranny And Suffering To The Civilized (or not so civilized, like in this case) World\\". The only episode which is worth watching in this load of organic fertilizer is the one with D.L. and Bushman, because it gives us that humanic feeling and is the only one free of bias and propaganda. The remaining story is just a portion of gibberish, and low budget doesn't excuse it in any way - the great \\"Rumble fish\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Sun\\" aren't the blockbusters either. <br />My verdict - if you want some bubble-gum for brains and also to watch some bad russian murderers who are also responsible for the tornadoes in the U.S., earthshakes in Japan and for the eclipses (didn't you know that?), that's for you. Otherwise, it is better to watch something else. But I must admit that DL is very good in this flick. <br /> <br />P.S. Only an idiot or a completely ignorant person would describe this thing as \\"a great portray of how the Soviet Union is, with their communism.\\" I was born in SU in 1981 and can answer for my words, although being in no way fan of Soviet system.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|this is the first record that i have felt compelled to write a review for. i have waited a year and a half for this disc. once i put it in my car stereo, i went through four spins and was amazed every time. it's more fluent than tremulant, and it's even more epic than de-loused. it does get exhausting at 77 minutes long, but it sucks you in and keeps you till you hear that gentle reprise of sarcophogi, which flows almost seamlessly to the beginning. the ambience is relaxing and intriguing and when it rocks....it rocks hard. you could pick them apart and make comparisons all day long, but i would rather admire their sound and dynamic landscapes. instead of telling you how each song sounds, i would highly advise just supporting the artist, and pay for a copy (i only paid $5.99 the day it came out!) <br /> <br />as a fan of classic rock and progressive music from all deacades, and in my humble opinion, the Mars Volta is the best rock band out right now.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is easilly the best cd I've heard in a long time.  It's nice to finally have a cd that isn't wore out after two listens.  It seems like there is a lot of confusion of the tracks, which song is which, or whatever.  My advice to you is put it in and push play.  Don't skip through the ambience, stress over a lyric, or think about the song title.  Just listen to it straight through, enjoy it, and appreciate it for being one of the best works of art that you'll listen to in a while.
B0002W4SWC|2.0|This is the kind of a movie in which the \\"f\\" word is treated as a clever witticism.  The humor is heavy-handed, the plot points are telegraphed from the beginning, and the characters are loathesomely self-involved.  If the people weren't speaking with British accents, this movie would not be nearly so well-reviewed.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I didn't know any of Coldplay's music until I watched this DVD, which a friend recommended.  I am very grateful to him for making me aware of this band that I thought was just another bunch of young guys churning out 21st century formulaic pop.  How wrong I was!!! <br />You know, I appreciate people's criticisms of this DVD--it does jump around in the editing a lot, but in my opinion it underscores the pace of the music throughout the performance.  And what a performance--what a frontman.  Such charisma.  Contrary to what many people have commented about Coldplay lacking talent--they may not be vertuosic on thier instruments, but they play within themselves.  Other bands that do this: U2 and Pink Floyd.  Enough said.   <br />Certain songs made me well up--Trouble is achingly beautiful, and Moses is one of the best songs on the DVD.  It's such a wonderful song, with great chord progressions and very Edge-like lead guitar work.  Many of the songs are indeed formulaic brit-pop (I think of other \\"Manchester-sound\\" bands like Oasis and The Verve) but they are crafted so brilliantly as to make you forget that they have the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-end structure.  They write such clever songs that stay with you long after you've heard them.  They get under your skin and you're happy they bounce around your head instead of some other crap that makes you crazy.  5 stars easily.
B000001GPX|5.0|Carlos Kleiber was an eccentric personality that did not record much. Karajan used to say that he was too lazy to spend his time in studio and only did that when money was running low. But anyway, the little left to us today is clearly precious. The recording of Beethoven's 5 & 7 simphnonies is a privilege to listen to. Specially regarding the least well known number 7. It is a strong and vibrant interpretation, full of charisma and passion, worth to be listened and re-listened to many many times.
B000002HJA|5.0|Kyuss always delivers that pure raw Rock and Roll sound without the total grunge feel to it.  New bands need to follow the direction that Kyuss set rather than Linkin Park.
B00008OWZC|5.0|BUY IT!!!! Way better than BBC Sessions and The Song Remains soundtrack.  Starts off not all that great with the LA Drone(Crowd noise wow!)  All of the rest is awesome.  Favorite Tracks: Over The Hills And Far Away, Dazed And Confused and Stairway To Heaven
B0002KVULG|3.0|Ok, so this isn't exactly the most scariest Dracula movie, but perhaps this is the most romantic. Frank Langella ( sp?) takes the role of the infamous Dracula and does a pretty good job. One thing I liked about Frank's performance was his eyes, he has very mysterious-like eyes that draws you right in. Dracula in this movie is much more romantic and this time instead of Mina, he goes for her friend, Lucy. Laurence Oliver would starr as the ever loving Van Helsing. While Donald Loomis would starr as Doctor Seward.  <br /> <br />The DVD quality is nice and clear like usual, and the sound is a little hard to hear at some times. The DVD also includes some good special features which is a treat for anyone who enjoys this movie. Feature commentary by Director John Badham. \\" The Revamping of Dracula \\" which includes interviews by the cast, director, producer, and composer, John Williams. Recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie straightly about Dracula's romantic side.
B00028HBKM|5.0|'The Passion' has done more to change lives for the better than any movie in Hollywood history period. If you haven't seen it, please pick up a DVD today and watch it. <br /> <br />There's also a wonderful documentary on it called 'Impact: The Passion of the Christ' that you may have seen on MSNBC the other night that proves 'The Passion' has had world-wide effects. <br /> <br />A neo-Nazi turned himself for 2 of the worst bombings in Norway's history according to the documentary on 'The Passion'. What does this tell you?
B000001DYD|5.0|This is another one of those rare albums in my personal upper eschelon that deserves 5 stars more so than almost anything else that I can think of.  I love almost everything that PJ Harvey has released, but the emidiacy, raw passion, and gut feeling that rock, lurch, and steamroll through every track on this album fall way above the standards of any other musician of our generation.  This girl deserves every iota of respect that she gets from her fans. I have never heard music that was more honest- that had such a sense that the artist was putting him/herself on the line with every track.  This album rocks like a mutha also.  Very highly recommended
B0006GAOCW|2.0|In 2004 there were two movies that dealt with the life of the first daughter: \\"Chasing Liberty\\" with Mandy Moore and this one with Katie Holmes. Guess which premiered in theaters first? \\"Chasing Liberty\\". Guess why - because it was better, and rather than release \\"First Daughter\\" at the same time, the studio delayed it so that it would have a better chance at the box office. The only problem is, by the time this film came out, it looked like a copy cat of \\"Chasing Liberty\\". I did not go see it in theaters because it looked like a second-rate version of Mandy Moore's movie. For a cheap rental fee, I was willing to check it out, and was not impressed. <br /> <br />Want a cute, smart film about the president's teen daughter who yearns to be normal and have fun? My recommendation is \\"Chasing Liberty\\"
0790734850|5.0|I feel like i was one of the last people on Earth to see this movie. I finally saw it yesterday and i was blown away by the amazing performances by Guy Pierce, Russel Crowe, and Kevin Spacey. I especially like Russel Crowe's attitude in the movie, he plays a really tough cop (...). Guy Pierce plays as a cop too who rats some of his fellow officers in a police brutality event. L.A. Confidential is about a corrupt police prescient in the 1950's. A good story line with good quality action, especially from Russel Crowe. the ending has a good twist too. Might want to check this out!
B0006U4UAU|5.0|James Murphy did more for the this decade's music than any other artist you can name. He started the DFA label and production team, helped The Rapture to find a place under the spotlights, revived the agonising electroclash vibe and, last but not least, released the single \\"Losing My Edge\\". <br /> <br />A terrific song which, the first time I heard it, have been processed to my brain as being the worst bleeping crap I ever heard in my whole life. I thought the case was closed and so I forgot about this \\"band\\", LCD Soundsystem (who the hell were they !?) <br /> <br />But that song kept fascinating me. I couldn't understand how so much people (and intelligent people that is, people who pioneered numerous musical styles I was craving for) loved that music. The guy couldn't rap, or sing, or both. The beat was repetitive as... and the overall feeling was sooooo dull, so dumb ! Four months later, I heard that song again, but this time I knew what I was about to face. And it wasn't that bad finally. Wasn't that bad at all. And I got it. The funkiness of the arrangments met the rawness of Murphy's voice, the trashy structure of the song was reminescent of punk, but the whole thing was electro, even disco.... and as for the repetitiveness, I realised how deep was the production and those beats were sacred to me. I will not talk about the lyrics, which are so self-destructive and cynical that just them could be subject to analysis. <br /> <br />The debut album of LCD Soundsystem is just that : a wonderful collection of discopunk gems, programmed with care, sung with a lazy, uncommercial and not interested attitude, all of that under the catchyness of some absolutely gorgeous melodies. The problem comes when you must get to know this sound, get in contact with it. And even a fan like me who have been following Murphy's solo thing since Losing My Edge, every single song is a drawback. Every new bit of sound require an effort to be fully appreciated. Songs like Never As Tired AsWhen I'm Waking Up and Great Release provide some Beatles-worthy vibe, a magical ondulation that takes control and are soothing in every way. On the opposite side, Movement and Disco Infiltrator provide great energy, just as the rest of the album do. A special mention goes to the Fischerspooner-esque song Tribulations which is gonna be the official best electroclash song of the year, and that's guarenteed. <br /> <br />In the end, James Murphy's here to save the dance music and he fulfills his mission. The only thing every one wonders about now is how the hell will he be able to make it better next time ? Are the tricks spent ? We'll see that on the next single.
B0002IVN9W|2.0|Every year there's a new city (Montreal) that is hyped up beyond belief and the bands that come from there or unfairly hyped up as well (let me guess - there's a girl in this band as well). Most of the time these hyped up bands never live up to expectation and or they are just plain bad. With the Arcade Fire, I wouldn't quite say they are bad but they are definitely a big letdown. The idea of starting a song soft and slow and then having it come to some sort of crescendo seems like a good idea but not for two to three songs on the same album. Other than that, there just wasn't anything that really tickled my fancy about this album. If there was something, most of the time it was a rip off of some other band (New Order drum beat). This is definitely one of those albums that you listen to once or twice and then trade it in at your local record shop. Sorry Spin Mag. and Brooklyn hipsters.
B00005ASGG|5.0|James Stewart and John Wayne are unforgettable here in what surely rank among their finest roles. Stewart is a progressive city lawyer who winds up trying to bring justice and democracy to the southwest; Wayne is a tough-talking gunman of the old West. Ford, with the help of a memorable cast that also includes Vera Miles, Lee Marvin and Andy Devine, brings incredible poignancy and sadness to this tale about America and its people in a time of change.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|America, get it together! 2 days ago I first heard \\"Left Outside Alone.\\" I downloaded all these other songs of Anastacia's now and I'm amazed that she's not a superstar here already. She's so huge in Europe and she deserves to be big here. I've been listening to \\"Sexy Single\\" nonstop and \\"Seasons Change.\\" All the songs are really good. She has a unique voice and it can go really high and really low. She's very talented and all the lyrics are actually smart. This album sold 10 million around the world and it should be selling that many in the US. Her album comes to the US in June. I'm buying it. If you're not familiar with Anastacia, GET FAMILIAR.
0140143505|5.0|\\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" is a series of letters charting the twenty-year correspondence between a would-be playwright in NY and Frank Doel, a London antiquarian bookseller.  From such a modest premise, Helene Hanff has created something with an almost unique charm which continues to endure as a successful book, play and film. <br /> <br />To me the great joy of Hanff is her style.  She is wonderfully conversational, humorous and self-depreciating.  She describes her life - learning ancient Greek or watching endless English films - with panache.  However, in truth very little happens in these pages.  Rather, it is the gently teasing nature of her relationship with Doel which shines out, the feistiness of the young American lady chaffing against the more reserved nature of the quiet, polite English gent, as they read their way through the 1940s, 50s and 60s. <br /> <br />On her death, the London Times said tartly, \\"Seldom has a writer sailed to literary fame in so slender a craft.\\"  It is true that 84 CXR is a very slim tome.  Yet it is one that bears much re-reading, as it seems that somewhere between the lines there lie more than a few life-lessons for us all. <br /> <br />Pilgrims to the real-life 84 Charing Cross Road will be sad to find that it no longer exists as such.  Look out for an \\"All Bar One\\" outlet however and a dull, bronze plaque commemorating the bookstore.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|If you haven't seen \\"Saw\\" (or is that sawn \\"See\\"?), don't read this. What a shame, because the ending deserves a better movie. I can suspend disbelief (\\"X-Files\\" comes to mind), but this film is insulting in its conceits. The convenient coincidences and the maddening stupidities piling up at the end reminded me why I bailed out of the Fox TV show \\"24\\" early in its first season. How does Jigsaw lay motionless for hours? Why does Dr. Gordon saw off his foot when the saw was long enough to reach the cell phone? He's a doctor. He couldn't tie a better tourniquet to keep from bleeding to death? How does Jigsaw know so much about so many people? How did Jigsaw lower Adam into the tub, then have time to position himself in the middle of the room before the water roused Adam? Dr. Gordon was awake when Adam regained consciousness, so why wasn't he aware of the presence of Jigsaw? If there was a lapse of time between putting Adam in the tub, Jigsaw postioning himself in the center of the room and Dr. Gordon waking up, then how did Adam not drown in the tub to begin with? If you've been given a \\"slow-acting\\" poison that you know will take hours to kill you, why not go to the hospital? A poison expert could narrow down the possibilities (how many such poisons actually exist?) and administer the antidote. Your 8(?) year-old daughter tells you there's a man in her bedroom and you don't search the room just to prove there isn't? Your wife disarms the \\"killer\\" then doesn't shoot him, especially when he's seated two-feet away from your daughter who is still tied-up? The daughter cries out, of course mom is distracted and of course the \\"killer\\" disarms her. How does the \\"killer\\" escape, travel to the remote location, negotiate the catacombs and get to the room where Adam and Dr. Gordon are located as if he's been there many times before? How did Jigsaw get Dr. Gordon's penlight? Once it was determined that Dr. Gordon had an alibi, why wouldn't the police start checking into his patients or hospital employees, since Jigsaw was clearly someone who had access to Dr. Gordon? This is only scratching the surface. Watch the \\"Making of..\\" featurette on the DVD (which was also pretty weak) and you'll see that this was a great idea in search of a story. And these guys are getting the chance to make \\"Saw 2?\\" Oy vey!
B00006LI4D|5.0|You tell me. I don't know. I tell you, Russell Malone and Monty Alexander's performance on this song has dazzled me for over a year. This was one of the first albums I ever got. It convinced me that jazz was worth listening to. I got this, and the solos have never failed to impress me. If you are a rocker, jazzer, rapper,or even a ukelele player you'll like this cd. My personal favorite is Fly Me To The Moon and Honeysuckle Rose. Ray Brown in himself is a virtuoso. He's played with lots of great players. Below are some other cds I recommend:             1. Straight Ahead (Ray Brown(b), Monty Alexander(p), Herb Ellis (g)) If you liked this album, this is similar with great playing and two cds!            2. Some Of My Best Friends Are Guitarists (Ray Brown (b), Geoff Keezer (p), Kareem Riggins (d), and Ulf Wakenius, Russell Malone, Bruce Forman, Herb Ellis, John Pizzarelli on different songs (guitarists))            3. Summertime (Ray Brown (b), Geoff Keezer (p), Gregory Hutchinson (d), Ulf Wakenius (g) This is also extremely similar to this cd.    P.S Please Check Out My Reviews On The Recommended CDs!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|With this movie came a deilverance of a reality check.Men have for ages been warriors and it lies within our system to have a desire for rage and physical superiority.\\"Troy\\" made me realise a lot of things.Its gigantic in its scope and absolute devotion to the theme it wishes to potray to the audience.<br /><br />A very interesting thing I noticed about most of the characters of the film was not the good acting and devotion to their role but the fact that their eyes spoke what their character demanded.Upon carefully analysing not for a second did I feel Im watching a movie. Its not at all exaggerated despite the countless number of characters with very well defined attributes. Brad Pitt was larger than life in this film.<br /><br />Its impossible to have favourites in Troy but the one character in this film that left me spellbound with his integrity and isolation of soul was \\"Hector\\"(Eric Bana) There were certain scenes with him in the film that bought out the Trojan in me.<br /><br />It'll be an absolute waste of time trying to figure out what I disliked about the film because I was completely spellbound and awestruck by the dialogues. I've lost count on the number of times a dialogue made me feel absolutely awakened and insignificant.<br /><br />The one dialogue I do waguely remember was the scene in which the little kid,messenger,demands Achillies presence at the war grounds. The kid says \\"I wouldn't fight a man as big as him.\\" And Pitt(Achillies) replies \\" ..thats why your name will not be remembered\\" Now I dont know what that did to the audience and how the audience in the theater reacted to it but it awoke a certain rage in me. I stood up and cheered for some reason beyond me.Always felt the insignificant need provocation and if this film doesnt certify everything I stand for and re-enforce all of its endless number of salutes it demands then nothing ever will.<br /><br />I know I am noone to judge something as mangamous as this but in my most honest opinion this film killed doubts in the line of thought imbred in me. A lot of dialogues and scenes in the film cannot be forgotten. I demand of everyone reading to go watch this film. Either rent the DVD or buy it but please watch it for your own good.I borrowed a friend's DVD . I can't wait to give it a second watch cause its an education in itself. This movie deserves being purchased and I shall do so ASAP. Quiet possibly the most brilliant historical re-capturing.<br /><br />With Much Muted Respect and 36 Salutes.film killed doubts in the line of thought imbred in me.

B0000VD04M|5.0|I knew nothing of Ed Wood going into this film, and came out somewhat of a fan. Not of his movies - apparently they're Z-class quality - but of Ed Wood himself. There is something remarkably infectious about a man who has a powerful vision, minimal talent, but refuses to give up fighting. To be honest, I wish I had his optimism - although I don't begrudge his apparent blind-eye that he turns toward his own talent. <br /> <br />Burton's direction was perfect, and his recreation of Plan 9 from Outer Space was absolutely hysterical. Who couldn't laugh at tiny hand made circular spaceships held aloft by fishing poles and hovering over the Hollywood sign? Especially when one catches on fire. Think of it - a metal spaceship on fire. That's a laugh-out-loud moment. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp proved, yet again, his impressive depth as an actor. I have no idea if he was playing a tongue in cheek Ed Wood, or if Ed Wood really did have that silly smile plastered on his face while trying to sell his pictures, but even if it didn't, it worked - brilliantly. It conveyed Wood's optimism, as well as his blindness. <br /> <br />Moreover, there was Martin Landau. His performance as Bela Lugosi was unparalleled. The film would not have been as tangible and believable without it. The Oscar he won for Best Supporting Actor was perhaps one of the most deserving in recent history. <br />
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|It's all about the fuss, cos it's no doubt Mr. Charles was blessed with talent. But he has better records and this was benefit by the GRAMMY's and MOVIE.
B000002C1W|5.0|Oh my god, 3 1/2 stars? Unbeleivable. 'Learning to Fly' is probably the best song by Pink Floyd period. The intro to 'Sorrow' is some of the best guitar playing i've ever heard. 'One Slip' and 'On the Turning Away' are good songs, too. The only songs I would consider bad are 'A New Machine' and 'Yet Another Movie'. To all Pink Floyd fans out there that don't have this album yet, sorry, but this isn't an unbeleivable masterpiece like Dark Side of the Moon, but it's still pretty good! <br /> <br />One more thing I have to complain about. People are saying this is a bad album for no reason other than 'It doesn't have Waters'.   So what? He was only one member of the band, the other 3 are still there. Members leaving the band happens all the time in Rock and Roll history. <br /> <br />If I were to put Pink Floyd albums in order from my favorite to least favorite, this would be behind DSotM, Wall, WYWH, and Animals, but ahead of everything else. I highly suggest this to anyone.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Well it is a matter of time, before, Miss Lavigne has her own TV sitcom a-la-canadian way.  Her sophomore record it's sold to the masses, obviously she wants to sell more and more.  many of the tracks in this album are cardboard copies of SKE8R BOI(HE WASN'T) or I'M WITH YOU(DON'T TELL ME), no wonder only one track manage to arrive at the top 10 MY HAPPY ENDING that is not that original....only NOBODY'S HOME was more original painfully real, but the damaged was done and the track only made it to #41, so sad for Miss Lavigne, but that's what happen when your album is not different from Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff.
B000002U82|5.0|From start to finish this classic is a masterpiece that will blow you away. While this album should be listened to all the way through, you can take songs off the album and play them on the radio. I suggest playing them this way: <br /> <br />1. Speak to Me/Breathe/On the Run <br />2. Time <br />3. Great Gig in the Sky <br />4. Money <br />5. Us and Them <br />6. Brain Damage/Eclipse <br /> <br />\\"Any Colour You Like\\" can't be played unless you play it with Us and Them AND Brain Damage/Eclipse. <br /> <br />But it would be better to just listen to the album all the way through.  <br /> <br />This composition deserves 5 stars all the way. Don't listen to anyone who gives this album 1 star, don't even listen to someone who gives it 4 stars! Just buy the album and you will love it.
B00006879E|1.0|Since THIRD EYE BLIND and MATCHBOX 20 are taking a well deserve break, this POPPY LOVE group MAROON 5 notice the resemblence with MATCHBOX 20, bot begin with M and have a number, HARDER TO BREATHE makes us believe they were a ROCK BAND, then comes the extremely anoying falsetto track THIS LOVE a pure POP rip off. It's not that original, sorry. SHE WILL BE LOVED is like those MOVIES that their intention is to make people cry, and they try to steal that tear...so obvious. SUNDAY MORNING prepared to the we made it lay back song...so so so average.  It makes me wonder if this group was not crafted in the studios of Sunny Cali, the singer thinks he's so cute....and he's not eat a burger and his falsetto it's now overplayed. Their formula is purely proved so they used once and again. BUY GREEN DAY skip THIS(Love)
B000006TRV|5.0|This two disc compilation is a great album to listen to all the way through, plus it has some good radio-played songs like Comfortably Numb, Hey Youm and Young Lust. I highly suggest this album to anyone who has heard the songs on the radio, any fan of rock/classic rock, and anyone who likes good music.    [...]  This album deserves 5 stars.
B00005JMJG|1.0|One of the most boring films I've seen a long time. Anybody who thinks this is original or trippy obviously did not grow up reading Phillip K. Dick.  There is nothing and I mean nothing new here. SciFi potboiler material.  It's hard to understand why it would get any Academy Award nominations while \\"Terminal\\" or \\"Kill Bill, Part II\\" got nothing.  Ten to twently years from years from now it will be completely forgotten.
B0007O38F8|5.0|50 Cent's The Massacre is a Juggernaut of a commercial hip hop album.  50 said that he didnt choose producers, he chose beats. Face it this album is a mouthful, it will take weeks for it to sink in your head.  50 Cent is known as a s..t talking rapper and this album is full of it. There is no doubt that Producer Scott Storch will blow up after this album,  His beats sounds like Dr. Dre durning the 2001 era.  The last song produced by Buckwild is strickly a Queens, Ny song, it will truley bring you back to the \\"Power of the doller\\" days.  50 is nbt the greatest rapper of all time, but face it kids he's the king.  And why is he the king?  Maybe its because physicly he embodies what we all picture a Thug to be.. whatever it is this album will keep the new generation happy.. but as for the rest of us were still waiting for Jay Z new Lp..
B00005JNNL|5.0|The other reivers give this film it's much deserved praise.  I would like to add one comparsion.  There is always some overlap in film releases during a given year.  Subject matter always seem to coalesce.  This year the subject of euthanasia was tackled by two films, the Oscar winning American-made Million Dollar Baby and the Spanish film The Sea Inside.   <br /> <br />Baby was a great film up to the poinit when the plot shifted and the real purpose of the film was presented to viewers.  This is the point at which the film should have ended.  The last 45 minutes of Baby were excruciating to watch.  I walked out of the theatre with absolutley no sense of empathy for any of the characters.  I didn't care.  It just simply wasn't very effective and DID NOT, in any sense, present the subject of euthanasia in a manner that would convince anyone it is a personal decision, not a religious one. <br /> <br />The Sea Inside is, in my opinion, one of, if not the best movie this year. It presents the issues of euthanasia in a very effective and thought provoking way.  In addition, the empathy you feel for all the characters is palpable.  <br /> <br />Hollywood's watered down messages and pathetic attempts to speak about important issues will always fall short of foreign films.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Unfortunately 50 aint come up with anything better then the previous album the last album was s$\\"t as it was and this has taken crap to another level ha ha!!!
B0002BO0AS|4.0|With all the bands getting noticed in this current rise of the \\"metalcore\\" genre in the metal world, Unearth is definitely one of the best.  \\"Oncoming Storm\\" finds Unearth blending old school metal vibes with hardcore music, and they do it better than almost anyone else.  The seven string double guitar assault works so well here for the most part, that you can't help but not admire the talent of these guys, and standout tracks include \\"Failure\\", \\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\", and \\"Zombie Autopilot\\" are prime examples of this.  The only real problem with \\"Oncoming Storm\\" is that it loses steam and wears thin as it progresses, which is something that has been plaguing recent metal releases over the past year or two, but other than that, this is a winner.  All in all, Unearth's \\"Oncoming Storm\\" is one of the best releases with the recent \\"metalcore\\" storm of late, and old school metal heads who haven't heard them may want to check this out.
B0002KQNL8|4.0|this movie I have always liked and one that if you buy will probably watch multiple times as I have. Its funny and got the good vibes of a Zombie flick. Could find it for less than what Amazon wants for it also. Return .o.t.l.d part 1 is also a classic . I will not have to go into details cause everyone else has. Personally I did not like part 3 of this series found it quit boring, it was based on like 5 zombies. I personally like Zombi flicks where the entire town is flooded with the Living Dead.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|They have so much to say but in such a bizarre way.  I always need my dictionary to understand the story. <br /> <br />I just put this album in and found a nice mexican melodie but not loud enough so I put more volume, I almost had a heart attack when I reach 45 seconds.  That's what I like about them, they go slow and becomes devastating. <br /> <br />Yes it's heavy, yes it's atmospheric, yes I hear a lot of influences from many many bands (I think they picked the best sounds in the last 30 years to put on this album).  They are just genius to blend different styles.  Nobody else can make progressive-punk-latin-heavy rock like they do.  They are the only ones to make me like salsa and mariachi? <br /> <br />Cassandra gemini is my favorite with a weird processed voice at the begining but our favorite Cedric's voice comes back right away and goes for very long. <br /> <br />I just wish they can tour around my area cuz their the band I want to see live the most.
B0006SSOHM|3.0|Good movie doesnt really get boring which is a good thing. But in a sense it is a bite off of \\"SEVEN\\" and some other movie but i cant remember. I wont go into detail but, its an ok movie. Im a big fan of 70's and 80's horror some 60's a majority of my collection horror atleast is like I said 70' and 80's so alot of this new stuff does not appeal to me much, at all. I did buy it from best buy cause it was only $14.99 whcih is not bad and I will watch it again from time to time on rare occasion, i more or less really brought just because I like to collect DVD's and it is good enough to buy. If you want a movie with a similar plaot and IMO just way better ,Buy the movie \\"SEVEN\\" which is one of the newer late 90 movies that i actually think is an excellentaction/thriller/horror.

0670033375|2.0|Have to admit I approached it skeptically.  After <br />all, how many `the sky is falling' books was I <br />bombarded with in high school and college....95% of <br />which were total bulls__t.  By 2005 we were <br />suppose to be broke, starving, gasping for fresh <br />air and either freezing in nuclear winter or <br />broiling under greenhouse gases. <br /> <br />Anyway, Diamond didn't disappoint.   I try to <br />remember that publishing is a business, and one <br />needs to be a bit of an alarmist in order to sell <br />books.   <br /> <br />My problem is that he lines up all the usual <br />suspects.  Thus the List Of Bad:  Cars, Mining, <br />Logging, Big Business, First Worlders then paints then with the exhausted rhetoric that frequently spills from the mouths of aging academics. <br /> <br />Cars are always a popular target for hysterics, <br />but he never bothered to point out that the air <br />in our cities is cleaner than it's been in 150 <br />years.  No longer is the air filled with <br />micro-particulates from horse manure, or the <br />belching smoke from early automobiles.  Yes, <br />third world countries suffer bad air, but is <br />there any reason to think that rising living <br />standards in those places won't bring them the <br />same environmental benefits? Think Seoul.  Think <br />Singapore.  Think East Europe. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint is that he totally frames <br />the food dilemma in ways that appeal to old <br />cannards that died out with Erlich's 'The <br />Population Bomb' 30 years ago.  The fact is that <br />in the past 50 years, the US has reduced land <br />under cultivation by 30% while quintupling food <br />production.  Hell,  the yield we can get from an <br />acre of corn has jumped 15% in the last decade.  <br />The food problem has more to do with oppressive <br />political systems than anything else.  He might <br />have done a better job pointing out that <br />protectionist agricultural policies in the USand <br />Europe keep the third world from developing their <br />land for agricultural export crops....a vastly more <br />beneficial use than subsistence farming.  Thus <br />they would have a greater incentive to care for <br />the land. <br /> <br />His biggest failure though, is not appreciating <br />the enormous power of basic capitalism to address <br />the issues he raises.  One thing vastly different <br />from most of the cases he describes is that today <br />we in the West have extensively distributed <br />economic and political power.  We also have <br />strict private property traditions.  All the <br />cases he describes in the third world are classic <br />`Tragedy Of The Commons' scenarios brought about <br />because of collectivist economics  they have in <br />place (we have our own `Commons' problem with <br />Social Security)  Private property rights would <br />solve 80% of the problems he describes. <br /> <br />A good counter to this book is `The Skeptical <br />Environmentalist' by Bjorn Lomborg.  While <br />equally polemic in places, Lomborg's is a much <br />more thoughtful work than Diamond. <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|I would give this album 100 stars if i could. Yes, it is that good. Nas' debut Illmatic is excellent. His lyrics, rhyming skills, the production, and the small amount of guest appearances make it perfect. Don't steer away from this album  because it's only 9 tracks long, that's one of tha reasons it's so perfect. There are no fillers on this album, every song is worthy. The album is short, but sweet. This is one of tha best hiphop albums to come out ever. If you're into early-mid 90's hiphop, you'll love this album. It has a great, laid back, New York sound to it, and Nas' has never sounded so good and given us lyrics better than these... it's street poetry. An ultimate hiphop classic, you can't call yourself a hiphop fan if you don't have it. Go out and get it asap. Trust me, you'll be happy you did. Excellent songs, excellent lyrics, excellent production, excellent beats, excellent guest appearances, excellent performance from Nas, excellent album. Go get it now. <br /> <br />
B0001AP12G|1.0|Kayne has some really nice beats but he simply cannot rap. Listening to him flow was like enduring 4 hours in the dentist's chair while listening to the same Kenny G song! Just because MTV and the media is saying that Kayne is tight doesn't make it so! Be your own man/woman and realize that this album is wack!
B000063V8R|5.0|This first fully satisfying season of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" is a must-buy.  Every episode in this third season is at least solidly entertaining (okay, I admit I have a soft spot for the one where Mrs. Troi is kidnapped by the Ferengi), with at least six or seven episodes being among the best the series has ever done.  Stand-outs include \\"The Offspring\\" (Data creates an android daughter); the trippy \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" (a time anomaly re-writes history, resulting in Tasha Yar being alive again); and \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" (the Borg return).  A suggestion:  if you buy this set, be prepared for a season-ending cliff-hanger, mainstays of ST:TNG from season three onward.  This means you might want to have the season four box set ready to go in order to see how the Enterprise gets out of the deadly situation with the Borg seen in the final moments of season three.  About the DVD's: picture and sound are sharp and clear, and the extras are often fascinating.  I especially enjoyed the surprisingly candid interviews, where cast members discuss what they liked and didn't like about the ways their particular characters were handled by the producers.  This is a great set; don't hesitate to pick it up.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|\\"Genius Loves Company\\" is not the record Ray would have made 40 years ago.  His voice shows wear, but his spirit is strong.  While the music may not have quite the same effect as \\"What'd I Say?\\" in his prime, it is moving and touching to hear these well-known voices blend with Ray Charles.  \\"Here We Go Again,\\" the Grammy record of the year, is an excellent blending with Norah Jones with Billy Preston's ever-amazing B3 organ.  James Taylor shows great energy on \\"Sweet Potato Pie.\\"  Ray's voice is a bit ragged on \\"You Don't Know Me,\\" but with Diana Krall's cool smooth delivery the track has a smoky last-call @ the Lizard Lounge appeal.  Natalie Cole & Ray generate some witty banter and send out sparks on the lovely \\"Fever\\" melody.  Bonnie Raitt's teaming with Ray on \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\\" is one of the set's great moments with Ray's voice suiting the worn emotions of a romance gone-by and Bonnie's aching vocals blending joyfully with Master Ray.  Carole King & Gerry Goffin's \\"Hey Girl\\" is such a lovely melody that when Michael McDonald joins Ray it has a very dream-like quality & becomes one of the best tracks because it is such a fine song.  B.B. King rips up the guitar on \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" making it a repeat button must for my blues mood with Randy Waldman's extremely fine piano.  As far as nailing a groove, this is the track that does it.  Ray & Gladys Knight fit together like a hand & glove on \\"Heaven Help Us All.\\"  Van Morrison is one of my all-time favorite artists.  His teaming with Ray Charles brings two artists well suited to each other's styles.  Saying goodbye to any great artist is never desirable, but \\"Genius Loves Company\\" is a fitting tribute to this master of soul!  Enjoy!
B00005JNSK|5.0|I saw the first movie and this will be as good as that one! I thought Willy Wonka was very springy!
B0000CDL93|5.0|It's a great and fascinating film, but Stone should have framed it up more as a trip into one man (Jim Garrison's) mind rather than what it becomes: an authoritative litany of supposedly factual evidence.  Subtlety and understatement are _not_ this film's strong suites.  You start detecting a relentless one-sidedness that could have been alleviated by presenting both sides of the coin.. for instance, many people went on record as hearing more than 3 shots fired, some from the direction of the rail yard, but couldn't someone quip \\"with all the tall buildings in Dealy Plaza, there must have been lots of echoes and accoustical artifacts\\".  Or when Sutherland relates that the D.C. phone system went dead for an hour immediately after the shooting he could have added \\".. or maybe this was just from a sudden overload of calls, I don't know\\". <br /> <br />This picture is still visually and technically remarkable although some techniques, such as the unsteady slo-mo with tracer effect have been mimicked and made passe by reality TV.  Casting was great but more true-blue southerners in some of the high profile roles (esp. Garrison) would have been good, for more authenticity in accents and chemistry of interaction. <br /> <br />After first seeing \\"JFK\\" in 1991 I remember feelings of outrage and that my eyes had been opened to the way \\"things really are\\".  The second time around, I did notice in the opening credits that the film is based on a couple of books, one by Garrison, and this clued me in to the fact that this film is a journey into Garrison's world, however monomaniacal and obsessionist it may be.  Stone should have taken more opportunites to make this distinction clear. <br /> <br />What sticks with me after viewing \\"JFK\\" this time around, is the laughable lack of security for the Dallas motorcade, then after the shots were fired the cascade of chaos, human error, and implausible coincidence.  A lot of Garrison's theorizing and Mr. X's monologue seem obsessionist andhalf-baked (kind of like those intense conversations from your pot-head days that seemed so profound at the time but then incoherent when you think back later). <br /> <br />My money is on this scenario: that the assassination was planned and done by a motley fringe group of individuals including Oswald, who had ties to rightist Cuban exiles and indirectly to low-level CIA; that the shots went crack, crack, crackBANG with the 4th shot coming from the rail yard; that the behavior at Parklawn, Bethedsa, and by LBJ and the Warren Commission was not an orchestrated coverup but independent reactions of officials who saw red flags and inconsistencies but felt, in the heat of the moment, that the whole episode had to be put behind as quickly and cleanly as possible to avoid a descent into a national state of anarchy.  From our comfortable, relatively stable vantage point in the year 2005 this seems like about the worst thing they could have done, but I guess you had to have been there.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Judas Priest return with a vengeance on their NEW disc,\\"Angel of Retribution\\",laden with their usual screeching vocals, fierce guitars and metal slam down your throat drums.Rob has returned as their ORIGINAL Metal Frontman and does not disappoint,with songs like \\"Demonizer\\" and \\"Hellrider\\" to the lower tones and beats of \\"Angel\\" and \\"Worth Fighting For\\".\\"Eulogy/Loch Ness\\" add the storylike complexity that is familiar with alot of Priest's older material,with a modern ring to it( a note worthy 13 minutes plus of sometimes intense and catchy chorus,that gets better each time you listen to it)for all of us JP fans to appreciate.\\"Revolution\\" adds to the legend of Priest's future of Metal Gods, with the  Anthemesque like lyrics.The rest of the disc is as good as you can get from any JP album from the late 70's, with touches of futuristic sounds and vocals.

0743454537|5.0|If you have never read a Picoult novel this is a good one to start with.  Her story of a family dealing with the illness of one child is moving, and a testament to holding on the what you have right in front of you.  If you are just looking for a good book to read or a fabulous new author to start this is the book and this is the author.  But be warned... reading a Picoult book is addictive and I have given this book to my mom and both my sisters.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|This is a perfect portrait of mass hysteria: a warning from history revealing how easy (and even attractive) it is to subvert your individual identity, follow the crowd and allow others to think for you. As for the film itself, it is a masterpiece of emotional manipulation presented in the form of a documentary. There is no dialogue or narration, however, except for speeches (most of which are delivered by Hitler), which, combined with an uplifting musical soundtrack and Reifenstahl's striking imagery (and masterful editing), strive to impress upon the viewer the power and glory of the Nazi Party in its heyday. What is most frightening about watching this movie is noticing both one's own emotional reactions, and the disturbingly small extent to which people have changed. <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. It was worth every cent of my money to go. I have seen it twenty three times! I saw it eleven times in theaters, so I'm pretty sure it was worth the money.        I was very dissapointed in the stage production's sound track and wasn't expecting much from this, but boy! I was wrong! I mean Sarah and Michael were ok, but Gerard and Emmy were beautiful together!          Gerard Butler was...There aren't words to explain it! His voice had so much emotion it was incredible! So much sadness or anger, I didn't even know you could do that!           Emmy was beautiful! And her voice was breathtaking...She was a great choice to be Christine. They harmonized extremely well.        Miranda (Madame Giry), although not having a lot of lines, was a imporatant character and did very well with her acting.        And Minnie did a very good job playing Calotta and Margaret was the perfect voice for Carlotta! Minnie sang a very beautiful song at the end. 'Learn To Be Lonely' was a very beautiful edition and fit perfectly well with the movie. If you have seen this movie as many times as me (I have seen it seven times! Worth every penny!), you will find 'Learn To Be Lonley' in the movie twice. Once after Why So Silent? and then at the end after Raoul puts the Papier-Mache musical box on Christine's grave.        This film was great and all the cast and crew deserve a big round of applause!        For all the people who thought this was a big mistake, it wasn't. You cannot compare these people to the original cast, it's moraly wrong. Also, you cannot say it could've been perfect because, even with the technology we have, nothing can be perfect. You people need to grow up! You are acting like children! I'm only fifteen and am acting more mature than you! (No offense...)       I think Andrew did a wonderful job making the new song and I think he should be and is very proud of this movie. I also think that Joel should be proud. He did a great job in casting these people!      This movie made me cry because it was so good and Gerard made the Phantom seem so sad and lonely. And because of Emmy making Christine so innocent and lovable. Gerard, Emmy, Patrick, Miranda, Minnie, Joel, and Andrew did a fantastic job and brought tears to my eyes! They all (Including all the cast and crew!) get five big stars and two big thumbs up!
B0007NFL18|4.0|Don't get me wrong, 50 Cent is not the most lyrical mc, but G-Unit comes up with the sickest hooks--period  The production and the hooks make up for his lack of new material.  Most of the tracks have the same theme--gun slingin',murderin',women, and money. (just like on Get Rich or Die Tryin).  The album has its strong points and its weaknesses.  The Game's album is more consistent though (so is Welcome to Ca$hville).  I believe if Dre would have contributed more time to the Massacre, rather the Documentary, maybe the Massacre would have been a little bit better.   <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|I'm one of the younger Green Day fans, so I'm not as crazy about the early stuff as I am stuff like \\"Warning\\" which was an amazing album. This album is also amazing, but it loses a star for me because of all the filler. The album is almost an hour long, but it really doesn't need to be. For example, why I ask, is there 20 seconds of just droning at the begining of \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" and what's up with the whole 'Nobody likes you' line they keep repeating throughout and \\"Homecoming\\" and bit in \\"Letterbomb\\" All in all however, if you liked Warning you'll like this, probably more. The band still has it in them with their music and the lyrics are once again brilliant and get this, sophisticated, unlike many other bands. There are alot of soft songs on the CD, which are ok, but nowhere near as excellent as the fast, catchy Green Day that we know and love. \\"She's a Rebel\\" and \\"Letterbomb\\" are some of the catchiest songs I've ever heard and the lyrics of \\"Holiday\\" are pure gold, making it my favorite song. I would definately recomend this to any fan of any kind of rock, considering Green Day is unlike any other band.
0316666343|5.0|I was stilling next to a girl on a flight to L.A. that was reading this book and after watching her laught and cry the whole way there (never putting the book down for 4 hours ), she finally turned to me and said wow you have to read this book it's amazing ....so i'did (on the way home ) ,. when you read the discription and you relize the book is about a  teenage girl that was murdered before here life even began you think .......ugh what a trear jerker .....but really this book isn;t about death it's about those left behind and how they cope (some times badly sometimes hilariously)......give it a try it's a very memorable book .
B0002J4ZWS|1.0|I really enjoyed this movie when I first watched it, as I did most movies with Tim Robbins. I just wish that he kept his politics to himself and not used his celebrity to amplify them. Nothing wrong with free speech- but actors generally have more media attention than the millions of fans they have. When was the last time CNN asked you about whether you liked a candidate, or policy? <br /> <br />Anyway, Tim Robbins is a great actor, but I can't get the image of him telling me how to think out of my head when I see him act now- and that has ruined a lot of movies for me.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I can't even complain about the money, because I got this movie from netflix.  I just want the 1 1/2 hours of my life back!  This was absolutely by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  I can't believe people even found this amusing.  Don't think I am some dumb humor snob either, because I found Dodgeball to be hilarious.  I can count the number of times I laughed during this movie on one hand and I think it was more out trying to find something humorous so it wasn't a complete waste of time.  My husband didn't even bother to finish watching.  Absolutely horrible!!!
0380789035|2.0|My only experience with Gaiman prior to this book was Neverwhere, and I found it entertaining if rather light and fluffy. With all the hype and positve opinions, I expected the 600 page American Gods to be as engrossing and entertaining as Neverwhere but with an epic scale and deep meaning to it. The idea behind the book points in that direction too: an examination of America's current cultural identity via a grand battle between the old world gods brought to America by settlers, and the personified forces of modern consumerism. You have to admit, Odin fighting the internet for control of America's collective unconscious is an interesting concept.<br /><br />So, between Gaiman's capacity for readability and the interesting premise there was a lot of potential here. But American Gods failed on both counts: I found it neither deep nor entertaining. The narrative structure is extremely fragmented. The digressions from the central story following the protagonist Shadow are long, many, and largely irrelevant. Even Shadow's story gets bogged down by the inclusion of people, places and details that are unimportant to the rest of the novel. I considered putting the book down several times, but I finished it in hopes that all of the anecdotes would come together to make some glorious unified point, but it never came.<br /><br />Perhaps this book would have been alright had it been edited down and not treated as an epic. Or else, written as an actual epic instead of a series of disjointed scenes. Either way, I don't recommend the book, and I don't understand why so many people do recommend it.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|What Michael Buble has done that many artist releasing technically their sophomore LPs is that he is consistent.  A lot of artists tend to fall off with their second LP, rather than striving to make it just as hot if not hotter than the first. Michael Buble again has made a traditional pop/jazz masterpiece which should surely get him high recognition.  His chart numbers for his second LP reflect this.<br /><br />Buble's voice is pure and truly made to sing this kind of music without making it boring.  By choosing to remake the famous Nina Simone selection \\"I'm Feeling Good\\", Buble not only effectively remakes Nina Simone, but brings older, classic music to a younger audience as well as an older audience.  While \\"Feeling Good\\" is the standout track, IT'S TIME features many great tracks including \\"Quando, Quando\\" feat. Nelly Furtado, \\"You Don't Know Me\\", and others.  Great productions, great voice, excellent, 4 stars.
B000683VI4|5.0|Yes i am a guy and i'm not a big fan of cheezy romantic comedies but this was not, it was a REAL emotional love story, it shows just coz you make a choice to be with someone doesn't mean it is the right choice, you must follow your heart if there is any doubt about a lost love. If there was a special movie i'd that i would watch with my girl i would choose this one.
B0007P3582|4.0|While THE MASSACRE is definitely a decent album, it lacks the flair and overall polish that GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' had.  While tracks like \\"Candy Shop\\" feat. Olivia, \\"Disco Inferno\\", \\"Piggy Bank\\", \\"In My Hood\\", \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" and even a G-Unit Remix of \\"Hate It Or Love It\\" are all superb, there is no true hit the caliber that 2003's \\"In Da Club\\" was.  Furthermore, this album is too long.  It would've been more effective had it been cut to 50 minutes.  The production is fine, but arguably, former 50 cent protege THE GAME's album is slightly stronger.  Most of the guest appearances, save for Olivia on \\"Candy Shop\\" aren't truly effective or moving.  50 Cent is good as always, but sometimes his stoic tone within his rhymes gets a little too boring through the 77 minute duration of THE MASSECRE.  Also while production is fine, as stated earlier (with the particular standout being Scott Stortch's \\"Candy Shop\\"), The production of THE DOCUMENTARY by the Game, which was of course produced by the same group of people for the most part, may be slightly better.  Of course, 50 Cent knew he had a lot to live up to with a sophmore follow up to the ubiquitous GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN', but while he does slightly miss the mark,  he has still produced an above average album, even if it isn't outstanding.  3 1/2 stars.
0385510454|1.0|I used to love Grisham. The Firm, the Rainmaker, the Pelican Brief, the Client all had me riveted. Then he tried his hand at a different genre (Skipping X-mas, A Painted House) and I yawned quite a bit but still hoped that he would redeem himself. However, I've read the Testament and now this, and I have to say, poke me with a fork because I am done. No more. <br /> <br />This book is truly horrible. I'm only giving it a star because Amazon does not allow anyone to select 0 stars. The opening paragraph is a mockery of intelligent writing and the plot is laughably absurd. Grisham spends so much time detailing the main character's environment and language lessons in Italy I felt like I mistakenly picked up a travel guide!!!  <br /> <br />Overall, this book is a joke. He must think the reader is incredibly stupid because he uses every cliche imaginable and spells out everything.  My creative writing class could produce a better book than this but, unlike Grisham, we wouldn't have the clout to get it published.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|I am always a fan of doing things outside of the box.  With that said, maybe The Mars Volta is slightly too much out of the box for the mainstream.  I love a lot of the things that they are doing on this CD, yet there are certain things that are missing to make this an outstanding affair.  The music is excellent throughout, especially the changing of styles throughout, yet often the words are not understood.  Also the length of the songs is overbearing for those not use to absorbing 8:00+ songs. Being a listener to \\"out of the box\\" jazz, I am used to hearing a lot of \\"out of the box\\" techniques, especially in works such as THE MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA.  However, the contrasting sections and time signatures used by that group doesn't contain lyrics, while FRANCES THE MUTE does, making it hard to comprehend.  I would recommend this work only to those who like things that are out of normal context with catchy hooks and chorus to bring the listener back to the \\"center\\" of the song.  This work, if anything, is definitely very ambitious and takes more than 1 listen to absorb.  I always advocate those who are trying to be innovators in the saturated music industry, so 4 stars THE MARS VOLTA.
B00009TB5G|5.0|How could they have topped \\"Fellowship of the Rings?\\"  The casting, scenery, music has become so entangled with the book that they're virtually inseparable.  Plus, this addition gives us 43 minutes enhancements to tell more of the story and the characterization.  I love getting lost in Tolkien's world for 3 hours or more.

B00003CXDD|3.0|\\"Willow's\\" story is a curious blend of Tolkien-style images--two races, gender shifts from _Bible_ tales, and \\"Snow White.\\"  The Evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) seeks to purge her realm of all girl babies because one will come to supplant her power.   <br /> <br />A nursemaid manages to hide a baby-girl born and secret her in a basket on the river.  The infant is found by Nelwyn (dwarf) Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) who reluctantly becomes her guardian to take her to safety.  Mad Mardigan (Van Kilmer) signs on as the daikini (Human size) bodyguard.    <br /> <br />The story's interesting if a little slow at times.  \\"Willow's\\" world clearly is not as well realized as Tolkien's, but Tolkien took many years to complete his works.  The scenery--a combination of Great Britain and New Zealand--is beautiful.  Acting is so-so.   <br /> <br />There are portions of the movie, monsters, swordfights, etc. that may not be appropriate for the smaller children in the audience.  Parental attention to how upset the kids will be over scary creatures, etc. is advised.   <br /> <br />While this is a a good movie for a first- or second-time viewing, I'm not sure anyone but hard-core fantasy movie lovers or children's film fans would want \\"Willow\\" in their collections.

0192804782|5.0|Although SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not of one Jane Austen's best novels, it is nonetheless a major novel, with the author's then-young talent in full display. Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.<br /><br />The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.<br /><br />SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed. Reserved Elinor and exuberant Marianne are expertly drawn, with Edward, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon (whose lovesick hopes for Marianne are dashed again and again) also engaging creations. Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.<br /><br />This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters. It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.<br /><br />Just because this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book. I highly recommend this novel for all readers.ocuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed.

The monsters are actually more afraid of the children than the children are of the monsters. <br /> <br />And that, folks, is the problem.   <br /> <br />As kids get more and more sophisticated, it's harder to scare them.  Monsters are working hard to make sure they have the power to keep their city running.

Sully and Mike take charge of her, but can they get her back to her home without being found out---or having her harmed?   <br /> <br />\\"Monsters INc\\" is a fun romp full of cute and engaging characters.  Definitely a must for collections of kid films of all ages.
B00004T0UT|5.0|The career of Elvis Presley had its ups and downs but most people (apart from the minority who insist that he never did anything worthwhile after the fifties) agree that the late sixties yielded some of his finest recordings. The album was originally released in the summer of 1969, made up of twelve tracks. This re-issue is even more impressive as it includes six bonus tracks, all of which were recorded at the same sessions. These extra tracks mostly appeared on singles, either as A or B-sides.<br /><br />Including all the extra tracks, this set includes four major international hits - In the ghetto, Suspicious minds, Don't cry Daddy and Kentucky rain. During this run of hits, Clean up your own back yard became a UK number two hit and also made the American top forty but is not included because it wasn't recorded at these sessions although its B-side (The fair is moving on, a beautiful but rarely-heard ballad) is here.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are also impressive, especially True love travels on a gravel road, an original song co-written by Dallas Frazier, a prolific country songwriter. Only the strong survive (an American hit for Jerry Butler) is a Gamble-Huff song - these two went on to major songwriting success with Philadelphia International. Other fine covers include I'll hold you in my arms, I'm moving on, It keeps right on a-hurting, Gentle on my mind and Long black limousine.<br /><br />This is certainly one of Elvis Presley's finest albums, with or without the bonus tracks, although it is worth noting that all the tracks can be found in the boxed set, From Nashville to Memphis, which contains all Elvis' studio recordings of the sixties except his soundtrack and gospel recordings.<br /><br />If you are an Elvis fan but don't want (or can't afford) the boxed set, you should definitely add this to your collection.

0060005688|4.0|Jimmy Carter was lampooned for talking about the American \\"malaise,\\" yet everyone acknowledges its existence. As the American gross domestic product has doubled over the last thirty years, the number of Americans who describe themselves as \\"very happy\\" has declined. The incidence of depression has grown to the point where 7.5% of Americans experience an episode of clinical depression before the age of fourteen, double the rate of a decade ago. The suicide rate among college students has tripled. We've had children shooting children in primary schools and in high schools like Columbine, divorce rates that make failed marriages more likely than successful ones, and sales of 50 million diet books per year accompanied by widespread anorexia and bulimia. In the midst of unparalleled plenty, Americans are remarkably unhappy.    In THE PARADOX OF CHOICE, Barry Schwartz proposes overabundant choice as a partial explanation for these disturbing trends. In prose that varies from casual and familiar to moderately academic (but never to the point of being difficult), Schwartz dissects the richness of America's consumption-driven society from a psychologist's viewpoint. He contends that too much choice is as bad, or worse, than too few choices and sometimes the same as no choice at all. We face more choices than ever before: more brands of toothpaste or cereal, more options on our cars and computers, more telephone calling plans, more types of vacations, more TV channels, more of everything.     Having so many choices in every aspect of life paralyzes those whom Schjwartz calls maximizers, those who invariably seek the \\"best\\" option for every decision. They face untold hours comparing alternatives and can never be happy even after they make their decisions because of other or newer alternatives, their own choice failing to meet their expectations, comparison with others, and adaptation effects which naturally lessen their happiness over time. More fortunate are the \\"satisficers,\\" those who are content with a good enough solution, yet even they can suffer the same psychic disappointments.     Each chapter of THE PARADOX OF CHOICE examines a different aspect of the \\"choice overload\\" problem. Schwartz introduces us to obscure terms like hedonic adaptation, hedonic zero point, and prospect theory, but his explanations are clear, backed up by helpful examples and references to underlying research and studies. For those of us without undergraduate degrees in Psychology, the author provides a gentle introduction to, and fascinating tour of, the psychologies of decision-making and (un)happiness in a consumer society.     While I found much of this book thought provoking, I have two significant criticisms. First, the writing at times feels repetitive and even over-explained, as if this was really an Atlantic Monthly or Psychology Today article forcibly stretched to book length. Second, even granting that the book is pop psychology, many of the author's closing recommendations are laughably simplistic, suggesting that people can simply turn off the same behaviors he has spent the previous 200 pages explaining as basic human nature. It's as if a book about alcoholism ended with cures to \\"just stop drinking\\" or \\"don't go near places where you can get a drink.\\" Telling people to write down every night five things that happened that day for which they were grateful sounds like Dr. Phil coaching Mary Poppins out of her blues.     For readers who want to understand why having more and more seems to bring less and less satisfaction, this book will provide food for thought. As a sociocultural exploration of middle class malaise in the midst of abundance, THE PARADOX OF CHOICE is itself a good choice. As a guide for how to cope with the problem, better to look elsewhere for answers. After all, followers of Buddhism have known for over 2,500 years that material possessions are a major source of human suffering, and for many of the same reasons Schwartz presents in this book.
0385510454|3.0|Over the years, John Grisham has repeatedly demonstrated his ability to spin a fascinating tale centered around something to do with the law, containing fascinating characters and memorable places. <br /> <br />He has shown this time and time again with books like The Firm, The Pelican Brief, A Time to Kill, and even The Last Juror. <br /> <br />When Grisham strays from this formula, the results aren't anywhere near as good - as in A Painted House and The Last Juror. <br /> <br />The Last Juror is a decent and intriguing book, but definitely not one of John Grisham's better works.  Straying into the realm of international espionage, John Grisham is out of his element. <br /> <br />This book is more like something that the Tom Clancy of old would tackle, not like the tradional Grisham novel. <br /> <br />The fact that John Grisham is so gifted at storytelling is this book's one saving grace, and the one thing that saves it from being rubbish.  It isn't boring, and it isn't predictable. <br /> <br />It's a decent book, but not classic Grisham.
B00005Q66T|5.0|-GHV2 (2001)-<br /><br />Released back in 2001, this album was like a Part 2 to \\"The Immaculate Collection\\". It contains some of Madonna's hits from the 90s and new millenium. The album peaked at #7 in the US, and only managed to sell around 1 million copies. The best explanation for this would probably be the absence of new material. Where the Immaculate Collection featured two new songs, this album features none. The album does have \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" and \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" though. \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" was featured in the movie Evita, in which Madonna won a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and the song is a very beautiful ballad. \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" was featured on the \\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\\" soundtrack, and is a really great dance song.<br /><br />1.

This album definitely doesn't come close to \\"The Immaculate Collection\\", mainly because there are no new songs. In my opinion, \\"Erotica\\" is pretty poorly edited and \\"Human Nature\\" loses a bit of it's edge. All in all, still a pretty good Greatest Hits album.<br /><br />My Top 5 off of the album are...

B0007N1AI6|5.0|The album PRIEST fans have been waiting for. It is a great comeback album,and although some fans will disagree that it may not quite be vintage Judas Priest,it is still a Hell of a way to return. The last two studio albums with Tim Owens were not bad albums but not good Priest albums. But this sounds like \\"Painkiller\\" era Priest with a little touch of class to it. The slower songs are very good also,and if some fans think the slow songs are not true Priest, go back and listen to the early stuff.The LOCNESS song is very campy and a bit silly,but it is still cool. TRUE FANS will love it, THE PRIEST IS BACK!!!!!!!!
B00004X01U|5.0|-Music (2000)-<br /><br />Released back in 2000, which was another busy year for Madonna. She gave birth to her second child, son Rocco, and married Guy Ritchie. She also released this album, which peaked at #1, and has sold 2 million copies since it's release. After \\"Ray of Light\\", Madonna made an album reminiscent of her first album. An album made entirely of dance songs, but this time, with a more electronic twist. The result is another brilliant album, although it's definitely not her best. The first single released was the title track, which went straight to #1, where it stayed for 4 weeks. It was also Madonna's fourth single to go Platinum. It's one of Madonna best dance songs to date, and one of her most recognizable singles. It was even covered by \\"Out of Your Mouth\\" just last year. The second single was \\"Don't Tell Me\\", a great country, dance song, which peaked at #4 in the US. The video, which featured Madonna as a cowgirl, started and international fashion craze. The final single was \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\\", which peaked at #23 in the US. While I prefer the album version, which is very soft and sweet song with some dark lyrics, the single version is a hardcore dance remix, which is still very good. The video to this song caused a lot of controversy, and of course, was banned from MTV. It was Madonna's third video to be banned, and this time, it was released on DVD.<br /><br />1.

Gone (9/10)<br /><br />All of the unreleased songs are very good actually. \\"Impressive Instant\\" is one of the best songs on the album, and is incredibly catchy. Madonna's voice is heavily decoded on this one. \\"Runaway Lover\\" is another really great song, and is also very catchy. The lyrics aren't bad either. \\"I Deserve It\\" is another one of the best songs on the album, and is sort of a ballady dance song, if that makes any sense. \\"Amazing\\" is a good song that follows along the same lines as \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", but it's not one of my favorites. \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" is another one of my favorites, and is more of a ballad than the rest of the songs on the album. Madonna uses the voice -decoder on this track to. \\"Paradise (Not for Me)\\" is definitely my favorite off of the album. It's a very slow and haunting song. To me, it's a bit depressing aswell. I love it though. \\"Gone\\" is a good song, but it's probably my least favorite on the album. All in all, this is another one of Madonna's greatest albums, with some amazing songs.<br /><br />My Top 5 off the album are...<br /><br />5) Impressive Instant<br />4) I Deserve It<br />3) Nobody's Perfect<br />2) What It Feels Like for a Girl<br />1) Paradise (Not for Me)songs on the album, and is sort of a ballady dance song, if that makes any sense. \\"Amazing\\" is a good song that follows along the same lines as \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", but it's not one of my favorites. \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" is another one of my favorites, and is more of a ballad than the rest of the songs on the album.

B00005TT77|3.0|Some of the songs on this album I'd never heard of before seeing the movie I Am Sam.  Although I'd have to say the contributions of Sarah McLachlan, The Black Crowes, and Rufus Waynewright are all great!
B00008S2VG|5.0|-American Life (2003)-<br /><br />Released not too long ago, in 2003, this is one of Madonna's most underrated albums. It managed to peak at #1, but dropped off the charts a few months later, but has still managed to sell over 1 million copies. The first single released, was Die Another Day, a great song which was theme to the Bond movie \\"Die Another Day\\", and peaked at #8 in the US. The second single was the title track, which hit #23 in the US. The song is very electronic, and features some \\"okay\\" rapping from Madonna. The video that was originally supposed to be released was an anti-war video. But with the war in Iraq going on overseas, Madonna decided to pull the video, and released a much less controversial video. People were shocked, and said that Madonna had only pulled the video so she wouldn't be backlisted. This is pretty much the reason why the album didn't do as well as it could have. Three other singles were released from the album. \\"Hollywood\\", which is my favorite Madonna song of the new millenium, \\"Nothing Fails\\", one of Madonna's best ballads yet, and \\"Love Profusion\\", another amazing song. The sad thing is that because of everything going on with the album, all of these songs failed to chart.<br /><br />1. American Life (10/10)<br />2. Hollywood (10/10)<br />3.

Madonna uses the voice-decoder, but it sounds great. \\"Intervention\\" is a great song, that seems to switch between being a ballad and a dance song, especially during the chorus'. \\"X-Static Process\\" is another one of my favorite songs, and is a very nice acoustic ballad along the lines of \\"One More Chance\\" from \\"Something to Remember\\", but it's much better. \\"Mother and Father\\" is another great song, but it's probably my least favorite on the album, mostly because Madonna's cringe-worthy rapping about halfway through. \\"Easy Ride\\" is another great song, with a very epic kind of feel, especially with the beautiful string arrangement. All in all, this is one of Madonna's best albums, and unfortunately, is so underrated.<br /><br />My Top 5 off the album are...<br /><br />5) I'm So Stupid<br />4) Love Profusion<br />3) X-Static Process<br />2) Nobody Knows Me<br />1) Hollywoodis another one of my favorite songs, and is a very nice acoustic ballad along the lines of \\"One More Chance\\" from \\"Something to Remember\\", but it's much better. \\"Mother and Father\\" is another great song, but it's probably my least favorite on the album, mostly because Madonna's cringe-worthy rapping about halfway through. \\"Easy Ride\\" is another great song, with a very epic kind of feel, especially with the beautiful string arrangement.

0385338082|3.0|Sophie Kinsella creates a warm, funny character in Emma Corrigan. She is young, hip, and worried about the size of her thighs and her wallet. She wants to get ahead at work but is having a hard time finding a career to suit her.    It sounds great doesn't it? Well it is... but ... I found myself picturing Emma as Renee Zellwigger in Bridget Jones. Young British girl, body-conscious and a bit clumsy at times, and falling in love with her suave and completely together boss. It all seemed a bit familiar to me. This is why the book gets 3 stars from me.    Overall, the book is an engaging, quick read that will make you smile. You'll flip the pages to see what happens next, glancing at the clock and swearing you'll turn off the light soon. But you won't. You'll want to know what happens. The tone is light, and full of charming British words like \\"biscuit\\" and \\"agog.\\"  If you like chik lit, read it. Just don't pay full cover price.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This past year the controversial new Mel Gibson movie the Passion of the Christ came out.  This movie is nothing but pain, suffering, and torture the whole way through.  However, even though it is not by any means, a fun and enjoyable movie to watch, it tells a true story and has a great theme and should be seen at least once a year (Easter is the obvious example) to remind us about what our Savior did for us. The content, I must say is very accurate. A must for any Christian!
B00005JMYI|4.0|Ron Burgundy is a 1970s news anchor in San Diego, a lonely, unintelligent man who will read anything that is written on the teleprompter. In Anchorman, his world is invaded by an ambitious woman with dreams of her own for the anchor position, and Ron doesn't quite know how to react. On the one hand, he is helplessly drawn to her beauty, but on the other, he is threatened, as no woman has ever been a news anchor before, and Burgundy doesn't want to look like a softie to the other news teams in the city. <br /> <br />To analyze Anchorman as a film would be foolish, as it is a movie designed to entertain with laughs, not encourage deep thought. It succeeds in delivering the laughs, though I did take issue with some of the more over-the-top elements, which, while providing perhaps the biggest laughs in the movie - such as the news team rumble - were out of place with the rest of the film, which at times was a very effective satire of television news reporters. <br /> <br />Will Ferrell does a great job as Ron Burgundy in a winning comedic turn, and Christina Applegate proves to be a wonderful foil for him as Veronica Corningstone. There are a few surprise cameos that I will not reveal; some were funnier than others. <br /> <br />I've been known to say that I would be entertained by Will Ferrell dancing on screen with a broomstick for two hours. In Anchorman, Ferrell doesn't get that chance, but the movie is still entertaining enough to warrant a hearty recommendation. Anchorman takes a little bit of time to get rolling, and while it may not be the funniest movie out there, it's still a solid comedy.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I spent the first 15 minutes of this movie wondering what the heck I was looking at. Then I realized that despite it's quirkiness & the fact that it isn't like anything else I've watched, I was enjoying myself.<br /><br />Sure Napoleon is the nerd other nerds avoid, but it certainly doesn't hold him back from doing his own thing without shame. Even the bad kids in this movie are not the traditionally vile little creeps we have come to expect from Highschool comedies.<br /><br />This movie is mostly noticible for what it lacks: Sex, profanity and cynical mean-spiritedness. The laughs are honest and the movie has a surpisingly satisfying ending when considering that the cast of characters are unapologetic \\"losers\\". This movie is difficult to predict for first-time viewers since it intentionally gives the reverse outcome to every scenario that we commonly experince in the movies. Kind of a \\"revenge of the Nerds\\" without the crushing humilation.<br /><br />Enjoyable & highly recomended.
B0002DB52M|2.0|Lar von Trier's Dogville is an ambitious motion picture. It is also contrived, self-indulgent, fatally overlong, and ultimately downright repulsive. Dogville tells the story of what happens when Grace (Nicole Kidman), on the run from gangsters, stumbles upon the small Rocky Mountain town of Dogville. She first encounters Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), the town's resident big thinker, who manages to convince the townspeople to offer Grace refuge, but in exchange they demand that she visit everyone in town once a day to help out with whatever chores they need help with. <br /> <br />The townspeople consist of a number of ominous personalities: the gooseberry bush-protecting Ma Ginger (Lauren Bacall), the blind old man Jack McKay (Ben Gazzara), the dumb wannabe engineer Bill Henson (Jeremy Davies) and his sister Liz (Chloe Sevigney), the apple picker Chuck (Stellan Skarsgaard) and his wife Vera (Patricia Clarkson) and their many children, the silent Martha (Siobhan Fallon), the professional freight carrier Ben (Zeljko Ivanek), and Tom's dad Tom Edison, Sr. (Philip Baker Hall) <br /> <br />At first, the townspeople seem shy and unwilling to accept Grace, but she does her best to accommodate them in the hopes that they will let her stay in town and avoid her troubles elsewhere. However, once the people of Dogville get to know Grace better, they treat her with unflinching cruelty and coldness - she is raped on numerous occasions by numerous people, as one example. Tom does his best to help Grace deal with everything - he's falling in love with her, and she with him - but there's only so much one man can do when he's trying to be accepted by both sides. <br /> <br />So, let me talk first about what I liked about the movie. The entire film is shot on a single stage, which represents the town of Dogville. Walls and props are few and far between, as the buildings are identified by outlines and text painted on the stage. It gives the film the feel of live theater, but with the freedom of film cuts and edits. Von Trier uses a handheld camera throughout, as he does in most his films. Because there are no distractions by way of setpieces, the actors are given the opportunity to shine, and shine they do. The only acting quirk that really bothered me was that Paul Bettany, who is British, could not seem to settle on one single American accent - he couldn't decide whether he was from the North or the South, East or West, or the ambiguous area in between all of these we call the Midwest. <br /> <br />Now, what was bad: the plot and the characters. Grace and Tom are two of the dumbest movie characters who make some of the worst decisions I have ever seen. Dumb movie characters are okay, but not when they're passed off as intelligent. Grace hangs around this town and takes abuse from these small-town folk for no reason. She doesn't tell anyone except Tom about any of it, and he's even worse than her. He's supposed to be this man with all of these great ideas, except all of his ideas are absolutely terrible. There isn't a single character you can even relate to in the entire movie - they're all inexplicably despicable. <br /> <br />And did I mention that Dogville takes three hours to tell a story so simple it could be told in about fifteen minutes worth of film? Plus, there is an overbearing narrator (John Hurt) who explains every last detail, instead of allowing the actors to express the emotions of the characters and allowing the audience to interpret those emotions. There is nothing wrong with making ambitious films, but if an ambitious film fails, it makes it ten times worse than when a formula film fails, because there is so much unfulfilled promise. In my book, Dogville is a grand, spectacular failure.
0380807343|5.0|We've been reading Coraline to our daughters, aged 6 and 4, at bedtime and they've been rapt with attention. What originally attracted us (apart from Gaiman's reputation as a writer) was the influence Lewis Carroll's work had on Gaiman as he wrote it. And the \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" effect is very obvious. It's a scary book, but that's hasn't bothered our girls, who are more interested in what happens next than in hiding under the covers. In my husband's interview collection, Voices of Vision: Creators of Science Fiction and Fantasy Speak, Gaiman talks about how intimate a book Coraline is, how personal, and after reading it, that's very obvious: \\"I can point to almost everything from the real world that's in that book, and tell you from where in my life it came. Coraline's house is the flat that we were living in Nuttley when I started it, except for the drawing room, which is the drawing room from the house that I lived in when I was five, which had the door that opened onto a brick wall. The nice old ladies downstairs were a pair of magnificent theatrical lesbians with a bunch of Scottie dogs who taught me elocution when I was 11.\\" So, yes, I have to strongly recommend Coraline, not just as a children's book, but as a book, period. It won many awards, and in my humble opinion, all of them well-deserved.
B00005QAPH|5.0|How does one begin to talk about 8 1/2? Every frame in this film could be put in a frame and hung on a wall. But it is not just the most brilliantly vivid visual film I've seen, it is indeed brilliantly conceived from beginning to end as well. <br /> <br />Guido is a film director who is struggling with his latest film. He's dealing with inner conflict - how to make a film with complex ideas come across simplistically so anybody can understand it - but also conflict with just about everyone else who is involved in the film, from actors to producers to professional Catholic consultants. On top of all of this, his wife knows that he's unfaithful and their relationship is ready to implode (or explode). <br /> <br />The plot is simple. The execution is complex, as director Federico Fellini shifts freely between the real and surreal, mixing and matching the outer world of Guido with the inner, in order to draw the viewer into the madness that is filmmaking. <br /> <br />I won't pretend to have understood everything that happened in the movie, and I'm not sure I would still pick up on everything after five or ten viewings, but I think the film works as an experience that doesn't necessarily need to make complete sense. In fact, it probably works better if some things don't make any sense at all. <br /> <br />8 1/2 gets a recommendation to anybody with any interest in film. It is an entirely unconventional way to tell a story that would be conventional in the hands of a lesser filmmaker. Fellini is known as one of the great directors for a reason.
B000000NN1|2.0|It's not Spiral, Albedo 0.39, or China. It's okay but nothing exciting. If you like his mushy bland stuff, buy it, but if you like Dervish D, Pulstar, and the sound of keyboards being pushed to their limit of expression, don't bother.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a hilarious movie. However, it has some key flaws - one-note characters and hardly any semblance of a plot - that take away from the film's enjoyability. It's a great setup for a movie, but all throughout, I found myself waiting for something better to happen. <br /> <br />The film stars Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite, an intensely weird high school kid who is an outcast in every aspect of his life. He enjoys drawing imaginary animals, like unicorns and ligers, and basically hates everything else. He wants a girlfriend, but who would go out with him? He lives with his grandmother and his 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), who spends his days at home on internet chat rooms with his long-distance girlfriend. <br /> <br />When Grandma Dynamite (Sandy Martin) goes down for the count after a dune buggy accident, Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in to take care of the boys. Rico is about the only fully developed character in the movie, a man trying to get back to 1982 and change the way his life has turned out. Of course, his plan for turning his life around involves selling Tupperware door-to-door and buying a time machine on eBay. <br /> <br />At school, Napoleon's buddy Pedro (Efren Ramirez) is running for class president against the most popular girl in school, Summer (Haylie Duff), while also swooping in and taking Deb (Tina Majorino) right out from underneath Napoleon's limp grasp. <br /> <br />I liked this movie. I really did. There were a lot of hysterical parts, but unfortunately, those parts don't add up to a complete whole. The quirky characters were dying for better situations in which to apply their quirks, but all of the plot devices were gathered from stock. If you're looking for a good laugh, I will recommend this movie, but if you're looking for a good comedy, you'll find better entries out there.
B000000NN4|5.0|I know some people prefer his orchestral and choral mush but give me this side of Vangelis any day. This is by far his most free and creative album. No constrictions of compositional niceties cramping his work here. Jazz, rock, electronica. This is for me his most exciting album; it gets your pulse racing rather than merely tickling the intellect. I prefer the short version of Pulstar from the vinyl EP but this version still thrills.<br />I just wish he'd produced more albums of this sort.
B0002EXH54|1.0|Do not buy this version! Parts have been re-recorded! This is not the original album as it's supposed to be! Ozzy Osbourne did this same offense not too long ago and now he's being sued. Stay away! Do not endorse this criminal activity of changing recordings. Buy the original instead!
B0000024RZ|5.0|This is my favorite Bob Dylan album.  I own all but a couple, close to 30 in total.  THE TIMES THEY ARE A CHANGIN' seems to sum up what the man is really capable of.  I think the reason this album means so much to me is that these songs have really become part of the fabric of American music, even more so than some of his other classics.  You can hear the experience of America; the struggling farmer, the opressed minority, the longing for love...I think this album will one day be regarded as more than a classic.  It will be regarded as something like a Shakespeare novel- a real masterpiece.  Not many singer/songwriters can write a song like the title track, a song that continues to touch young people with it's timeless message and simple tune.  And that's just the first track...
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I teach high school, and so many kids said that I should see this movie.  I was too busy drawing weird mythological creatures, and dragging action figures behind the bus to see it in the theatre.  So I just saw it on dvd...<br /><br />I have this quirk in which I tend not to want to see things people say I should see, and a lot of independant films fall short for me, but this film is the real deal.  It is quirky, it is defiant, and for the most part, it holds true to it's main character.  The thing I liked most about the movie was Napoleon and his steadfast dedication to being him.  This is a character...not a stereotype...that's the way I see it, anyway.  These are kids who are strikingly true to who they are..<br /><br />True, the film does lag at times, and lacks somewhat in substance, but it is headshakingly original in so many ways...It is a little like cleaned up John Waters, or linear David Lynch..<br /><br />My only negative is that at the end the film moves to a more traditional sort of ending....that is dissapointing.  I think that Napoleon deserved more than that.  Otherwise, the movie is amazingly original and fun.<br /><br />Check it out.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|What it's not: Bourne Identity style super-crashy car chases or Tarintino \\"I love fake blood and gunshot effects\\".<br /><br />What it is: a pretty good, old fashioned caper.<br /><br />There's lots of gold and a team of experts out to get it.  Predictably, there's a classic case of backstabbing amongst the thieves who did the job (I don't think I'm spoiling anything here -- any movie where the first 15 minutes are of a job going smoothly, you KNOW there's going to be a doublecross to set off the next hour and a half of film).  We then follow the team as they go on a mission of vengence both to reclaim their booty and to get even with their wayward associate.<br /><br />The clever bit is the planning that goes into the operations.  A lot of movies replace interesting plans with high speed car chases, giving us nothing but an action film.  The Italian Job is a caper foremost and an action movie secondly, heralding back to the days when movies survived on the merit of the script rather than the special effects budget.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie a lot, it just goes to show that with the right cast and a good script, you don't need to smash 6-figures worth of vehicles to make it worth watching.
B0000019PA|5.0|It seems that the narrative aspect of Aeroplane is being missed.  At the first few listenings it isn't obvious, but once you really delve into the lyrics it is more apparent.  And no, it isn't a tight knit story, so that makes it harder to hear too.  It seems that it is about a boy who falls in love with a Jewish girl who is then killed by the Nazis.  Of course this is just my theory, but I think that it makes sense.  It ties the weirder lyrics together, and it also gives the \\"I love you Jesus Christ\\" line real meaning.
B00003CX95|5.0|If there was ever a movie I would call an epic masterpiece, this would be it! <br />A sweeping saga of epic proportions, Mel Gibson directs this superb story of Scottish hero William Wallace. <br />Extremly well done battle scenes, combined with rich settings and costumes, perfectly complement the story, as Wallace and his band of stragglers pit themselves against the might of the British under their evil King. <br />Rightly deserving of an Oscar, this film also boasts a wonderful cast, and a lovely soundtrack that is spine tingling in parts. <br />Quite a sad, moving story in parts, with the viewer sharing in Wallaces sadness and frustration at being betrayed by those he placed his trust in. <br />I've really run out of superlatives to describe this movie it really is that good! <br />Well worth seeing! In my humble opinion, one of the best movies <br />of all time. <br />The special edition DVD also contains a great little documentary on the making of it that is also very interesting and really makes this even better value. <br />Thanks for reading
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Hi <br /> <br />I had a couple of favourite songs first, but after a closer look i got to like the entire album. I play it in my car all the way to and from work. Its a keeper for sure, looking forward for next Lavigne's album.  <br /> <br />Regards
B00003CXA2|5.0|A truly brilliant, groundbreaking movie, this is one of my all time favourites. <br />Hugely popular, and winner of many deserved Oscars, that is rightly so. <br />Much has been written about this movie, so I will just add my little extras: <br />a/ Superb jokes, some overt, some very subtle <br />b/ Wonderful use of digital photography/ computers etc to insert \\" Forrest \\" into historical television footage. <br />c/ Beautiful settings, I especially love at the end of the movie where Forrest is describing his many places that he has been, ie running through the desert, the night sky in Vietnam, the evening on his Shrimp boat. <br />d/ Great casting, Gary Senise is brilliant as Leiutenant Dan, Sally Field is wonderful as Forrests mum. All the actors and actresses were great! <br />e/Some of best acting ever seen in any movie by Tom Hanks <br />f/ One of the most brilliant collections of 60s and 70s music used on a movie soundtrack. <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but really you should see this for yourself if you haven't seen it yet. <br />And if you have seen it, hey watch it again, you know you will enjoy it! <br /> <br />Really one of the best movies of all time <br /> <br />Thanks for reading <br />
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I've had this movie a week and watched it three times already.  This one's a keeper!  The dancing is spectacular especially the finale.  It's the best Paso Double ever!  The story line is cute, the acting sometimes a bit overdone by some of the characters, but that's not why you watch it!  It's all in the Dance!!!!!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|What strikes me most about this movie, is that friendship can be struck up anywhere, even in the most terrible of places such as prison. <br />I did love that the fact that Tim Robbins character escaped from the prison after so many years, you could feel the triumph surge around you when you realised he had managed it! <br />This is one of those great movie moments. <br />But the lasting memory I will have is the helping and comradeship that exists, especially in an unjust environment, between people thrown together, living in dreadful conditions. <br />A gritty movie, superbly filmed, that sustains a high level of interest and anticipation throughout. <br />If you love a good drama or prison movie you will love this. <br /> <br />Thanks for reading <br />
B000002OX7|5.0|pure, but decorative hard rock at its best.  I was initially skeptical about the Who when I heard some old best of thing of theirs, but when I got this cd, it blew my mind how well they arranged their music.  Not a weak moment on the cd, and almost 20 tracks, some newly added.  I would say this is a desert Island disc, a defining document of one of the most exciting rock bands of the 60's and 70's.  Start here, but by no means is this comprehensive career overview.  Just get this, Tommy, Quadrophenia, and live at leeds (although I opted for Live at the Isle of Wight because it was cheaper and had the same songs.  I highly recommend that one instead, because it is a very high energy performance) also get one of their single disc Best Of cd's which have stuff from their first several albums ( something like Who's Better, Who's Best).  stop listening to me, get it and be astounded and led into a journey of discovery of the Who!
B00005JLSE|4.0|I have never been a big fan of musicals, and there is only a couple that I consider great movies, like \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Cabaret\\". I have to say that even though \\"Chicago\\" is not at the exact same level as these two movies, it is good enough to leave a lasting impression. The music is very good and entertaining, the performances of Catherine Zetta-Jones and Renee Zellweger are inspiring, and the story is interesting.<br /><br />The film starts by jumping right into the action, with amazing music - what a great song is \\"All that Jazz\\" - and with Velma Kelly (Zetta-Jones) walking into her dressing room, hiding a gun and washing the blood from her hands. That same night, Roxie Hart (Zellweger) is among the audience watching Velma and dreaming of being like her. She even witnesses when the police comes to take Velma away for the murder of her cheating husband and her sister, who was the object of his affection.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Roxie is acting on her dreams, and to get there she is sleeping with a man she believes has connections in the show business world and can help her become a star. When she finds out that he was lying, and his \\"connections\\" were just a scam to get into her pants, she kills him by shooting him point blank. The husband tries to save her, but is not successful in his attempt, and does not try hard after he figures out what was going on between the deceased and his wife; thus, Roxie ends up in the same prison as Velma.<br /><br />Enters Billy Flynn (Gere), the slick lawyer that has a reputation for being able to get anyone off the hook, no matter how gruesome the crime or how abundant the evidence. He is Roxie's last chance, so she has to engage in a competition with Velma to see which case he handles first. The corrupt environment also includes Mama (Queen Latifah), the prison guard who really believes in tit for tat and is always on the prowl for fresh meat.<br /><br />I was surprised when I learned that both Zellweger and Zetta-Jones actually sing themselves in all the music pieces, since the quality of their singing is superb and it appears to be done by professional singers. Both of them do an outstanding job in their acting, and are supported in their roles by the quality performances of Richard Gere and Queen Latifah. Congratulations to Rob Marshall and his team for a remarkable final product.ly sing themselves in all the music pieces, since the quality of their singing is superb and it appears to be done by professional singers.

B000001ESN|5.0|The songs on this cd are all classic Rush songs, several of them still giving fans excitement at live shows.  Not as perfectly structured as Moving Pictures, but one definitely has to listen to the cds in conjunction with one another.  I don't think this album has aged as well as some of their others, but it is essential and one of their best.  The song \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" was their first real hit, and this cd marks the point when they had their first popular success (aside from 2112, which was just a first step)  Pick it up.   <br /> <br />Other good cds from this era of Rush are:  2112, A Farewell to Kings (which is very well liked), Hemispheres (not as good, but similar), this album, and Moving Pictures (their peak album)
B0007N1AI6|5.0|The Metal Gods have returned! Halford finally returns with Judas Priest and releases a metal onslaught! Angel of Retribution is the true follow up to Painkiller. In this album, instead of trying something completely new, they stick to what worked and mix their best sounds into one. You can hear sounds from Painkiller from \\"Judas Is Rising\\" and \\"Demonizer.\\" You hear a little from British steel from \\"Revolution,\\"  \\"Worth Fighting For,\\"  and \\"Deal With The Devil.\\" Also, they go really old school by bringing back the sound from Sin After Sin with \\"Angel\\" and \\"Eulogy.\\" You even get a feel from Defenders of The Faith with \\"Hellrider.\\" Something that is new with Priest is the last track, \\"Lockness\\". Which pays off immensely since its one of the best tracks on the album. Overall, this is one of the best albums Judas Priest has ever made. (The fast solos are back!)  <br /> <br />And, to add on top of this great album, they even included a DVD. The concert footage are songs from past albums and shows that Judas Priest can still put on one hell of a show! The true gem from the live material was the acoustic version of Diamonds and Rust, really giving it a better feel to the original. The documentary is also great to check out. All Metal fans, BUY THIS CD! If you have at least one Priest album w/ Halford, you must get this one!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|First off I would like to voice that to some of you lifelong Beatles fans I am what you might call, a \\"youngster \\". Then again,... so were the Beatles! So if you are about to disregard this review please read on I am ( what I consider to be a experienced listener ).<br /><br />Now, for all you amazon regulars who come on this site ( which by the way, I exclusively use to check out new bands I hear ), I would like to inquire if you actually know what the hell you're talking about! This is a excellent Beatles collection that I have become quite fond of. However I do admit that it would be a much better idea to buy the albums the a hits collection.<br /><br /> While on this matter I would like address one reviewer who, and I quote \\" I had hoped that this would be an opportunity for young people to hear how good the Beatles sounded to us older fans when these songs were originally released as singles. However, for the most part, the selections on this cd are not the original mono single versions, they are the same sloppy stereo outtakes that EMI has been foisting on us for the last 30 years.\\"<br /><br />What is this person saying he says that the Beatles no longer appeal to young people, well I'm listening to it aren't I? Also, he's also saying that he would rather listen to some hybrid, over produced version of classic songs, the last time I checked the versions featured on this collection far from sloppy. Anyway my point is, is that this is a great singles collection from the most talented bands to ever walk on to a stage and pick up a guitar. Without timeless classics \\"Hey Jude\\", \\"Come Together\\", and \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" ( just to name a few! ).Then I don't know how I would cope with staying up until one in the morning trying to finish an assignment due the next day without listening to<br />\\"Hey Jude\\" or \\"Eleanor Rigby\\". Please do not listen to reviewers like the guy quoted above, listen to me and just buy the cd! And if your really smart you can buy the rest of the catolougue as well! Let me reccomend \\"The White Album\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" (my favourites).<br /><br />By the way if you don't want to take advice from a fourteen year old then feel free to cheeck No.<br /><br />...........The Beatles Still Rock!!!t me reccomend \\"The White Album\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" (my favourites).    By the way if you don't want to take advice from a fourteen year old then feel free to cheeck No.     ...........The Beatles Still Rock!!!
B00005JN0T|5.0|I'm an action fan. I'll admit that outright. But because I've seen so many, I know what to compare one against. Unlike many action movies, I Robot has a good story (not the most memorable, but well done for an film such as this) based off of the plot fundementals of the original sci-fi novel written way back bearing the same title. It also has a surprisising (at least, again, for a film in this genre) human quality, an emotional depth of sorts to it. One of the reasons Will Smith's character, CPD (is that how it goes?) Detective Spooner, is predjudiced against the robots is the fact that he came see them as humans. He can only see them as machines of logic, cold, and emotionless, to be used for industry, not for more human roles. The reason for this feeling is some time before the movie, Spooner's car and another car get trapped in a river, and they're going under fast with Spooner and a young girl trapped inside of them. A robot tries to save them, in accordance to the first law or robotics (and robot cannot endanger a human or through inaction allow a human to come to harm), but as it can only rescue one, pulls out Spooner, leaving the girl to a watery grave. A normal human being understands how precious young lives are, and would gladly give their lives to protect their's. A robot doesn't understand that. A robot thinks in logic, which is good for industrial purposes, but not for human things like this. It saves Spooner because it calculated a higher survival rate for him than the girl (something like 30-something percent to like eleven percent, I think, yeah, we'll just go with eleven). But like Spooner tells Dr. Calvin, eleven percent is more than enough. This is an example of the emotional depth this movie carries, which I believe stands out a bit in the overall movie community, not to mention the action genre. Anyone who can't see that should read the first fifty pages of so of Tom Clancy's Executive Orders or just read Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six for a better understanding of what I'm saying. <br /> <br />The plot itself doesn't stand out too much in the film industry, but it is above average. There are a coupla good twists thrown in for good measure, and is a well-rounded whodunnit mystery.  <br /> <br />Now seeing that this movie has an unusually deep plot for an action flick, does it mean action was sacrificed for story? Two words: heck no. The gunplay effects are similar to those seen in good pure action films such as the Matrix films and Mission: Impossible 2, and it's brilliantly choreographed. The chase scene in the futuristic interstate between Detective Spooner (Smith's character) and a two cargo haulers full of robots bent on destroying Spooner (since he found out stuff they don't want him to know) is one of the most memorable action sequences I've seen in a movie. The filmmakers nicely combined action with good storytelling to make one awesomely entertaining movie. <br /> <br />The acting is definitely not subpar in this movie. Will Smith, while still keeping his Fresh Prince persona mostly intact, has a more human quality, which is necessary given the character he's playing. Spooner is a man who struggles with his beliefs against robots and the fact that they are making him an outsider of sorts, and Smith brings out his character's personality well. There is a good amount of smart acting here. Most of the characters have some genuinely funny quips in there. Dr. Calvin is especially amusing, given the fact that at first her character seems to have no sense of irony (one of the reasons I liked Terminator 3; the robots have no emotion and say very ironic stuff cuz they can't grasp the fact that it's ironic) given her seriousness obtained from her very technical position. The only bad part here is that Shia LaBeouf wasn't given a very large role, and a rather pointless one at that. He's a good actor, and he should have gotten more (and more valuable) screen time. <br /> <br />The visual effects in this movie are great. They really spice up the action sequences. Of course what good's visuals without good sound? I Robot packs some fantastic audio pieces in to nicely wrap up the entertainment package. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an enjoyable time. My only problem with I, Robot is that Shia LaBeouf was very limited in his acting role. He's a really good actor and has a lot more potential (The producer people said that he originally had a larger role, but much of it was cut). This is quite minor in the overall scope of the film.   <br /> <br />As a note: Some people are upset that the movie doesn't follow the book that specifically, but one must admit that I, Robot is still an entertaining movie on its own. I believe you must grade this movie along with other movies like this (harry potter 3 for one) as a standalone film to grade it fairly.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Vol. 3 the Subliminal              Verses By: Slipknot <br /> <br /> <br /> Slipknot is an awesome band straight out  of Iowa. They are  extremely heavy but well-loved by all head bangers. This cd is a good choice for all the metal heads out there. It's  very dark and heavy just like all of Slipknot's other cd's. Most of the songs are around four minutes long, and there are fifteen tracks, two of which aren't extremely heavy. Slipknot is an awesome band to  skateboard to because the music they play is really fast  and aggressive just like my skate style.   <br /> <br /> Corey, the lead singer, has amazing vocals and he really shows it with this cd. This cd is good to listen to when you're angry at someone because it will help get your anger out without hurting somebody. I think this is a good cd for everyone who loves metal. Slipknot's cd's don't have swears in them which means no parental advisory. I think this cd is the best Slipknot cd to date and I can't wait for the next one!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I have been waiting for this album for over a decade!! Judas Priest is back with another fantastic album. \\"Angel of Retribution\\" is classic Priest, with all the classic Priest elements in place; Downing and Tipton have not missed a beat since \\"Painkiller\\", the guitar work on \\"Retribution\\" is amazing..Halford's unique vocals are top-notch and he sounds like he's finally come home. It's amazing that Priest has been able to rebound so well from their mis-steps of the 1990's. Now when you listen to \\"Jugulator\\" or suffer through either of the \\"Fight\\" cd's, you can just breathe a sigh of relief and know that the Godfathers of Heavy Metal are all back where they belong. \\"Angel of Retribution\\" in a nice mixture of previous Priest sounds from the \\"Painkiller\\" era sounding \\"Judas is Rising\\", to the \\"British Steel\\" sounding \\"Deal with the Devil\\", to the \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" sounding \\"Angel\\", Judas Priest revisists past glories and ties them all together with an updated sound. If you are a fan of the band then you will love this disk!! And as a nice extra, the bonus dvd is great. You get to actually hear and see some of Priest's best loved tunes performed live! The DVD is almost worth the price of the disk alone.
B0002VL6ZA|5.0|I heard the three hit singles from Hotel California waaaay too much on the radio back in 1977. And now Classic Rock stations play the song \\"Hotel California\\" so much that I have to turn the radio off when it comes on, or else get sick of what is actually a great song (\\"Stairway To Heaven Syndrome\\" psychologists call it). I was, however, a big fan of the album from the git-go, hearing it for the first time in late-December 1976, when the album was played in its entirety by the local rock station.  <br /> <br />Falling out of love with Classic Rock sometime in the late 70's, I didn't listen to it much again until recently. Hearing it now, I enjoy \\"side\\" 2 much better than side 1, which puts me firmly in the minority of most Eagles fans. This may be due to my overexposure to the radio hits on side 1, but also because I love the Joe Walsh and Randy Meisner songs on side 2. They provide a nice break from Don Henley's singing, which is great but tends to produce \\"listener fatigue\\" when he handles too many of the lead vocals (and lest you think I'm not a Henley fan, \\"The Boys Of Summer\\" is one of my all-time favorite songs, period).  <br /> <br />\\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\" is somewhat reminiscent of Joe Walsh's work on his first (and best) solo album, 1973's Barnstorm. \\"Pretty Maids,\\" like most of Barnstorm, is a nice deviation from Walsh's more well-known guitar rave-ups. It was written with Barnstorm-mate Joe Vitale, and has a dreamy, richly-textured production, utilizing piano (Walsh) and synthesizer (Walsh & Glenn Frey). It also has some nice percussion work from Henley and, as usual, heavenly background harmonies.  <br /> <br />\\"Try And Love Again\\" is one of my favorite Eagles songs, and easily the most underrated song on this album (I even love the syntactic faux pas of the title). Great vocals and guitars. It has been called the Eagles' last country-rock song, but to me it sounds more like a hybrid of early-70's Southern California Rock and mid-60's Merseybeat/Searchers-style Pop (with the bright, ringing guitars and chord structure built around the loping D major). It also provides Frey with one of the best guitar solos in the Eagles canon, which is quite a feat considering the great players, past and present, in this band. I'm not sure why this track was never released as a single - maybe because Meisner was on the way out? Too country-rock, which the Eagles were trying to move away from, partly to win over rock critics (some success) but mostly to broaden their fan base (much success)? It's too bad that Meisner didn't use this type of musical setting as a starting point for what looked to be a promising solo career, rather than releasing a series of (mostly) lame, generic rock albums. Not that he would have sold any more records, but it would have made a few of us happy. Regardless, I have missed his great vocals (lead and harmony) on subsequent Eagles recordings, and I haven't even mentioned his talents as a bass player. Oh well, Meisner fans among the Eagles' throngs appear to be few and far between. But if you need proof, compare his vocal performance on \\"Take It To The Limit\\" with Frey's more recent renderings. The difference between good and goose-pimply.  <br /> <br />As good as the individual Eagles are as lead vocalists, they seem to be even better as background singers. In fact, when I think of the \\"classic\\" Eagles vocal sound, I think of their background harmonies, whether it's Meisner's soaring high-harmony or Henley and Frey's vocal blend, which seems to take on a separate voice all its own (for a great example of this on a non-Eagles track, listen to Dan Fogelberg's \\"Someone's Been Telling You Stories\\").  <br /> <br />Back to Hotel California. I think \\"The Last Resort\\" is a great closer, but Henley almost ruins it by getting preachy in the final verse. I said almost. It's still a great song, even though you know it was written by a smug millionaire rock star (sorry Don, at least I didn't call you a hypocrite or a - gasp - liberal, and actually \\"smug\\" may be unfair).  <br /> <br />It goes without saying (I know, I've already said it) that the guitar work on Hotel California (by Frey, but especially Don Felder and Walsh) really kicks this album up a notch. And that's coming from someone who loved Bernie Leadon's Clarence White-inspired playing on all those great early Eagles songs (e.g. \\"Take It Easy\\").  <br /> <br />For some reason, the Eagles are loathed by most alt-country and \\"progressive\\" country bands - probably stemming from Gram Parsons' and several prominent rock critics' dislike of them - while being embraced by many current Country Radio artists and fans. Emmylou Harris and Chris Hillman don't even like the term \\"country-rock\\" and look like you poo-pooed on their cowboy boots if it's mentioned to describe their music (they prefer Parsons' term \\"Cosmic American Music\\" - which I don't think will ever catch on). But to be honest, Gram must have been a little envious of the radio play the Eagles were getting, while he was getting virtually none. Current Country artists, such as Toby Keith, certainly have more in common with the Eagles (at least Henley and Frey) when it comes to arrogance and the personal dislikability factor.  <br /> <br />But unless you enjoy throwing the baby out with the proverbial bathwater, you have to give the Eagles, and this album in particular, its due. And if you haven't heard the DVD-Audio version in surround sound, then you need to. Awesome. Now, excuse me while I go online and purchase a pair of tickets to their current farewell tour. Anybody have a spare $400?
B0007O38F8|1.0|Ok, so I read the reviews in Rolling Stone and on Allmusic. And I set my current scepticism for mainstream hip hop aside for a moment. But this CD is basically a shoddy retread of \\"Get Rich.\\" The songs are less inspired and free of any really decent hooks. Two years gone by and 50 hasn't gone anywhere. Like the Game's Documentary, this was a disappointment. I could get a hint of how much longer 50 Cent will be a household name. How much of the same crap can even the 'check out my ringtone crowd' listen to. Unlike his bidnis-patna Eminem, 50's delivery is static and boring. It's a challenge to listen to 50 mumble his way through 22 never-ending tracks.  Every song is so predictibly boring it's painful to listen to. Oh yeah, Candy Shop? I was sick of it when it was called Magic Stick last year.<br /><br />Also, I have to bring this up, but what is the problem with mainstream rap cover art? Why is EVERY album a picture of the artist and that's it. Are these people trying to blend in with each other? No wonder everybody downloads. There's very little in hip hop worth owning.<br /><br />That said, Gatman and Robbin' is decent and the last track, Hate it or Love it, is worthy of mention. The album bumps but it begs the question: \\"If I've got Get Rich or even a Lloyd Banks album, why would I want this?\\"

0385512058|5.0|This book reinforces the notions that every semi-successful person has always had.  The more people you know, and know well, the more doors are opened for you.  Never Eat Alone will remind you, or teach you, the ways of getting in on the action of business and life.  It will teach that generosity is the key to ultimate success.  Mr. Farrazzi is highly regarded as being one of the most connected people in the world, and his book DEFINITELY gives away the secrets to make every person with a little bit of ambition the tools to do so as well. I highly, highly reccomend this book!
B00005V9IL|5.0|James Cameron personally as always been one of my favorite directors. Although reports say he can be a hard ass on set, he knows how to make a film and knows how to balance between action and drama. After his 1st film Terminator(he did make Piranha 2 but we're not counting that) and one of my all time favorites Aliens, he made the Abyss, a film that had an incredibly difficult shoot but still is quite watchable.<br /><br />A nuclear submarine encounters an object which can travel faster than any machine or known aquatic life. The sub ends up hitting a rock cliff and plummets into the ocean but just above crush depth(the more lower you go, the more pressure in which case the sub would literally get crushed to pieces).  The Deepcore station, an underwater oil rig is the closest to the sub so they're ordered to do the mission. Accompanying the Deepcore team is its designer and a group of Navy Seals led by Coffey, who gets more unstable as the film goes on.<br /><br />While exploring the wreckage, a crew member witnesses something and goes into a coma while another one sees it too and of course no one believes her. 2 subplots from here: Coffey's increasing paranoia that it's Russians trying to get at them and first contact with this alien life form.<br /><br />Shot in a massive tank, 2 actually, the shoot was quite long and arduous with many problems with either the set, or the safety of the actors.  But it sure does pay off in a way. One thing that sets the film a bit off course is it's pace. It's not a long movie but it almost feels it. And the ending is far better in the extended version since the original was so abrupt.<br /><br />Normally I don't comment on commentaries but this was probably the most informative and even funny at times commentary I've read. Yes I said read. Since we can read faster than we can speak, the filmmakers decided to type out the information at the bottom of the screen almost like a subtitle. There, you'll get info on the sets and what was miniature or full scale, tidbits about the shoot and story, little insights and even some humor.<br /><br />James Cameron to me can't make a really awful film but this one is a bit lower on my top films made by him but in no way is this bad. It's quite a good watch and the rat fluid breathing is of course so cool.what was miniature or full scale, tidbits about the shoot and story, little insights and even some humor. <br /> <br />James Cameron to me can't make a really awful film but this one is a bit lower on my top films made by him but in no way is this bad.

B0007P3582|4.0|By Listening to 50's new album \\"The Massacre\\" and reading some of the reveiws already posted here, i'm really disappointed to see that some people haven't familiarize them selves with the term \\"If you have nothing good to say dont't say anything at all\\" or worst for them to be such player haters. Comparing his last album to this one, 90% of it is off the hook but it's still a great album thats going to sell millions of records... my advice to the real hip hop listeners... The Massacre, \\"GET ONE!!\\"
B00005N5S5|4.0|Just before he made this, James Cameron made Piranha II. It's best you don't seek it out.  But he had the idea for this film after a dream where he was the intended target of the terminators. While it's not a bad film, it certainly is dated throughout the entire thing as an 80's film.<br /><br />In the 90's, mankind will create an AI, or artificial intelligence. However, the AI becomes aware of itself and decides to nuke mankind. From then on, the machines annihilating the humans. A lone man named John Connor teaches the men how to fight and bring war to the machines and hold their own. To counteract this, the machines send a special machine called a terminator into the past to go after John's mother Sarah before he's born. So our guys send Kyle Reese to protect Sarah.<br /><br />It's pretty cool watching this film as even though he hasn't had a whole lot experience, James knows how to shoot a film. Action scenes are well done and they're pretty simplistic in its terms too unlike the ambitious sequel.<br /><br />The effects probably down the film as they are quite dated and very visible including the makeup effects when Arnold gets smashed up or when the full terminator skeleton walks. In T2, a lot of the effects still hold up despite advancements, here, they look old. But of course, the terminator's so cool you're thinking who cares?<br /><br />It's the movie that launched James Cameron's career, made Arnold a star, and was a launching pad for more advancements in technology. It looks its age but it's still no less fun

B00008PC2O|5.0|Known for having sets and ideas that tend to push the bounds of filmmaking, James Cameron likes to be ambitious and have films that would otherwise be quite a bold risk. Before this film he made the Abyss, a complicated underwater shoot that wasn't a huge hit Fox wanted it to be and before that Aliens, a really tight schedule with big sets, miniatures and a 10 feet tall queen alien. Now the advancements are more digital but still no less groundbreaking and in turn, still exciting.<br /><br />John Connor, mankind's savior after machines declare war on their creators, is actually a deviant, robbing ATM's of cash with a special laptop and disobeying his foster parents and getting in trouble with the law. His mother Sarah is in an insane asylum has her declarations of nuclear war, machines, terminators and time travel make her apparently nuts. In the first film, the machines tried to kill Sarah before she gave birth to John. Now, they're going after John himself.<br /><br />As a protector, John in the future reprograms a terminator to save his skin in the past instead of the last time which was a human soldier.  Only he looks like the terminator from the last one so it obviously freaks Sarah out since he tried so hard to kill her.<br /><br />The film is definately more ambitious with a thrilling bike/semi chase to the rescue and escape from the insane asylum and to the incredibly real and powerful nuclear dream, it really pushes the series into a better direction rather than just being a nice action movie, this is a ride.<br /><br />Also after ILM's digital breakthrough with the pseudopod from the Abyss(that water tentacle), ILM was responsible for creating the T-1000, the villain of the film who's entirely liquid metal and is capable of imitating what he touches and using his body to creating blades to stab people with.<br /><br />The movie quite frankly oozes cool. It's got action scenes, drama and character development, some comedy and some classic scenes(I still smile during the \\"Bad to the Bone\\" intro). The DVD set is practically exhausting where it details so much about the film, you probably know enough to create your own Terminator 2 but let's face it, you can't duplicate a classic, there's one already here.still smile during the \\"Bad to the Bone\\" intro).

B000001EAQ|5.0|some say it's a difficult album to listen to. I'd rather say it's one of their easiest. When it rocks, it rocks so well and fair, when it sounds electronic, it just had to. <br /> <br />People MAKE IT difficult to listen just because they were expecting something similar to what existed already..Fortunately it's not the case. (contrary to their latest ep). <br /> <br />This album is a subtle mix of intensity and musical harmony. A sad harmony sometimes. But there is this kind of vitality and emergency that makes it full of life.   <br />The voice of Bono is close to your ears, especially in \\"if you wear that velvet dress\\". Sublime of sensuality. Unsurpassed. <br />\\"Miami\\" is incredible, \\"if god will send..\\" is pure genious. <br />
B0007O38F8|2.0|50 Cent is one of the most horrible rappers alive. He has gotten this far based on his song's beats, and beats alone. Strip away the beats,and you hear childish lyrics that a four year old can write. He also needs to upgrade his song content because how much longer can you talk about how you are all street, and yet on Piggybank, make one of the worst lyrical disses of all time? His feud with Ja Rule was stupid. The reason why his first album sold so well was because people kept hearing In Da Club, and how he was stabbed 9 times, that is basically it. This album is a very weak effort, it felt, in some places, that he wasn't even trying. What is his obessesions with his guns, for example Gatman and Robin(????), one of baddest song titles I have ever heard. He is definitly following in his predacessor's footsteps and is probably going to make weaker efforts than this, but this is just bad. It is being force fed to the masses, and they like it because of it's repetive beats. Also, some of the beats by Eminem are horrible(stop producing Em, come on).<br /><br />I hope I have done you justice by reviewing this album.
0596000480|4.0|Whether you are expert in the field or just familiar with programming in general and want to become expert in the field, this book is for you. It's not a cookbook, and you will not use it for cut-and-paste programming, as is your common plague in javascript litterature. It will give you access to the innards of the language though, teach you relevant history, and the reference parts include lots of oh so useful and hard to track down facts about which browsers lack (or have flawed implementations of) which objects, methods, constructs and the like. <br /> <br />It's not full coverage, especially not regarding fairly recent APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and, until recently rather small and obscure browser platforms such as Opera and the Macintosh browser families, but it's a good step on the way and most likely heading that direction. I've seen past editions tag along with happenings in the ecmascript world fairly well so far, and expect future editions to do the same. <br /> <br />This book gets you on top of the tech relatively effortlessly and quickly, and its reference sections have saved me heaps of time. That last star is saved for the next edition that brings it back in touch with the web development frontlines again.
0312995423|1.0|I had recently read The DaVinci Code and it was mildly entertaining but not as great as my friends had led me to believe.  This book is totally flawed from a technological point of view.  Nearly every detail, not just of cryptography but of software and hardware in general is wrong.  The total misrepresentation of public key encryption should have been a tipoff early on, but I doggedly read on.  But getting the technology wrong was the less egregious offense in this book.  The biggest problem I found here was the attitude that government should have the legimate power to invade citizens' privacy in order to protect them.  Further, the denigration of the Electronic Freedom Foundation was in pretty poor taste.  If I could have given this book negative stars, I would have...it really is that bad.
B000002KKS|5.0|like one reviewer said, lets face it, ozzy is not the greatest singer in heavy metal. while ozzy has a much better stage persona and really defines the heavy metal genre, ronnie james dio is a MUCH more talented musician. the album has a much more cleaned up epic feel as opposed to say, sabbath bloody sabbath which has a more garage metal production to it. not to say that SBS is by any means a bad album, it is great in its own way. but heaven and hell really shows what a true timeless metal album should sound like. the musicianship is unparalleled, one of Tony Iommi's all time best performances on the guitar, with some of the most complex riffs you'll ever see. if you love heavy metal, this is a must-have, whether ur an old sabbath fan or not, get over it and welcome this gem to your collection
B0001AVZA8|1.0|How you could put Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton together and come out with a film this empty and cliched is beyond me. Any filmgoer over the age of 15 should easily be able to predict every single incident in this plot five minutes before it happens. I mean every little moment, every expression, every line, every coy flutter of an eyelash. Certainly not every film demands a \\"plot twist\\" but to not present a single curve to make the audience sit up and take notice (and stay awake) is aggravating. Nicholson is a gigantic talent who is totally wasted here, and who I hope profoundly regrets taking the role. The bad boy skirtchasing thing is getting so, so tired. Diane Keaton proves that a woman of advancing years can still be quite stunning and sensual, but she's crippled by a deadly script. The scene everyone talks about (prompted by a studio campaign that centered on it) where Nicholson accidentally sees Keaton nude could, I'm not kidding you, qualify for Worst Acted Scene of the Decade, in which both actors present their characters as if they had their big toes caught in an electrical outlet. Frances McDormand is also on hand, but her work must surely be sitting on a cutting room floor someplace as she's totally irrelevant to the film and if you blink you miss her. Keanu Reeves again shows that he can't act his way out of a soaking wet paper bag... which is precisely what this script is. Just a dreadful, dreadful, dead film. An insult to the audience.
B00006DEFA|5.0|it seems like it would be a very boring and dull movie, but it is not. i find it very entertaining and incredible. ive always thought this was a good movie, despite the people who say its boring. one of my favorite scenes in all of the movies ive seen is the scene in amadeus when wolfgang takes salieri's song that the emporor played for wolfgang when he came in. then wolfgang replies the song is already in his head from one hearing when offered to keep the sheet of music. when challenged to show them, wolfgang not only plays the song, but makes it better and better and faster and faster. it is truly a great scene. and the guy who played salieri deserved greatly to win best actor back in 1984 with this movie. he was SO good. <br />anyway, its a good one movie. EASILY in my top ten movies of all time. but if you dont like period movies, or if you dont like ver intellegent movies that are &quot;boring,&quot; then dont watch this. you will find no satisfaction. have an open mind when watching this.
B000021YQV|1.0|The first time I listened to this album I was thoroughly disgusted. Repeated listens did nothing to endear me to it.   This album basically sounds like it was written by a band that listened to \\"System of a Down\\" and thrashed out a really bad rip-off of it. Get the band's self-titled album and avoid this piece of garbage.
B00000255O|5.0|A real Herbie fan would realize that there was so much inovation on this album.

B0001UL7RY|1.0|The first time I heard a song off this album, I had no idea it was supposed to be music at all.  When I first heard Avril Lavigne screeching \\"Since You've Been Gone\\", I assumed that somebody was broadcasting a \\"Slasher\\" horror film over the radio.  Was that girl on the radio being slashed to pieces with rusty dagger?  Now that \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" is firmly stuck at #1 on the charts for many months to come, I now realise I was mistaken.  Avril Lavigne wasn't being murdered or raped--she just has a horrible, screeching, annoying voice. <br /> <br />If you don't like music, and would rather listen to noise instead, then this CD is for you!  There is absolutely no trace SINGING anywhere on this CD.  In the verses, Avril Lavigne mumbles in sarcastic, brooding, miserable displays of self pity.  And as soon as the chorus comes in, the monotone mumbling explodes into furious screams of rage and frustration.  Avril Lavigne is not a singer.  I think \\"screamer\\" would be a more accurate description.  She yells, screams, screeches--but never sings. <br /> <br />Avril Lavigne's lack of talent is undeniable.  It is not an opinion that she is untalented, but a FACT.  ANYBODY, absolutely ANYBODY can wail at the top of their lungs over a bunch of distorted guitar noise.  ABSOLUTELY ANY teenge girl could have created this screaming racket, and I can PROVE it. <br /> <br />All you 17 year old girls reading this, go get a tape recorder and record yourself screaming as loud as you can about how miserable your life is growing up in the suburbs.  I bet it will sound *VERY* similar to Avril Lavigne. <br /> <br />And as for all you people in Napanee, Ontario \\"Avril's Hometown\\", I've got news for you--Avril Lavigne is nothing for your town to be proud of.  Your whole town kisses her @ss, and that is pathetic.  I come from the same town as a baseball star.  Do you see us kissing his butt just because of his fame?  Of course not!  We're not the least bit impressed by his fame of wealth.  You shouldn't be impressed by Avril Lavigne's.  NAPANEE SUCKS! <br /> <br />Anybody that like Avril Lavigne is an IDIOT, end of story.  Anybody that thinks angry yelling requires talent is retarded.  Avril Lavigne is for retards.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|There's really no way to describe this album without listening to it.  It's just . . . amazing.  Basically, if you took creativity and converted it into a solid form, this piece of music would be a strong contender for what would result. <br /> <br />No, it's not \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\", but then again, if you expected it to be, then you really don't know what the Mars Volta are about.  They've said repeatedly, for the past two or three years, that they are not interested in playing the same music over and over again.  That's the reason they split up At the Drive-In and formed the Mars Volta in the first place.  Their music is an exercise in originality, energy, and imagination.  If it doesn't change from album to album, they have failed.   <br /> <br />That being said, \\"Frances the Mute\\" is an outstanding progression from its predecessor, just as it was from the \\"Tremulant EP\\".  Even more so than the previous disc, you can't really appreciate \\"Frances\\" fully if you don't listen to it all the way through, and more than once.  That's not hard to do, though, as the album kind of grabs hold of you and doesn't let go.  Something about it will stick in your mind and never leave, whether it's the calm, acoustic opening of \\"Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus\\" or the Spanish wailings of \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" or, in my case, the haunting line from \\"Cassandra Geminni\\" that states \\"No there's no light, in the darkest of your furthest reaches . . .\\"  Someone said that there was a lack of singable melodies, and, to some extent, yes, compared to other albums, there are far fewer sing-along-type songs here.  But I have no idea how \\"The Widow\\" or \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" or any number of the frantic guitar lines throughout the album could not play itself over and over in your head, just like the best (and worst) of all those memorable radio tunes. <br /> <br />Ultimately, the Mars Volta have created yet another masterpiece, one that demonstrates growth, originality, and sheer genius of Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler Zavala.  I (and many, many others) will be awaiting their third full-length album with much anticipation.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Saw PMG in Chandler, AZ last night, I've seen them about a half-dozen times before. As others reported, they performed TWU in entirety to open the concert, followed by old standards and some interesting duets and trio arrangements. The new material is very good, a very ambitious piece, I expect it comes off in concert much better than on CD. The band was at its peak last night - the new drummer is a huge improvement over Wertico, there were some moments during a duet with Pat where the interplay approached the heyday of McLaughlin/Cobham. The harmonica player is an excellent soloist, nice to see Rodby playing electric bass more, and I never thought I'd see the day where Lyle played the \\"metal guitarist\\" act on stage. Trememdous layered sound and very tight performance. Pat's improvosations, while at times a bit well-worn, were more inspired and amazingly, his technical abilities seem to be actually improving. Don't miss it.

B0007P3582|4.0|Well after the humongous success of 50 cent's first ablum it was gonna be nearly impossible for him to top it and naturally he didn't.  What he did do was put out an enjoyable and highly entertaining cd.  The lyrics and flows are sub par but he makes up for it with sticky chorus hooks that you'll be singing for days. At least he knows his strengths.  I think my only problem with the cd is the infamous track \\"Piggy Bank\\".  As diss songs go it's not \\"Ether\\"..it's not even, \\"The Takeover\\".  He dissed Nas who prolly doesn't care and won't be respond but even Fat Joe and Jadakiss can flow circles around this guy.  Honestly by this point most heads are saying to themselves, \\"another dull rap feud\\".  I'm gonna end this review by saying, this ablum is a fluff piece, but a higly entertaining one.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Angel of Retribution is the first album by Priest with Rob Halford on vocals in close to fifteen years. Expectations were huge,and people wondered if Priest could pull it off. And they did, but there are some qualifiers. <br /> <br />The good news is that there are two tracks on Angel of Retribution that should be instant Priest classics. The opener \\"Judas Rising\\", tailor-made to open a live show with it's opening scream and relentless riff, and the electric ballad \\"Angel\\", which should be a fan favorite live. Rob Halford can sing as well as he screams, and this song proves it. <br /> <br />Some minor quibbles include a couple of filler tracks, as well as some of the lyrics. I don't like when bands are self-referencing, peppering their new songs with old song names. It happens frequently here. And a thirteen minute epic about the Loch Ness Monster is so wonderfully absurd, so Spinal Tap-esque, it's almost endearing. Luckily, the musical side of \\"Lochness\\" is so old-school and heavy, fans of the early Priest albums should love it. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an album that does a pretty respectable job in covering almost the entire musical spectrum of Judas Priest's career, and listening to it reminded me of the paraphrased line Bruce Dickinson said once. \\"Listening to Judas Priest is like a tank rolling over you.\\" That's what this album reminded me of, and for a metal band, that's about as high praise as it gets.  <br />
1400031524|4.0|<br />  Novels whose protagonist is inspector Kurt Wallander from a small village of Sweden, contains for me as much sociology and  politics as crimes. This books follows a chronological order, so we can see the aging of the personages and the pass of time in the police station of Ystad, South Sweden. That is fully believable, although it seems not likely that in a  small village it could happen so many terrible, complicate and strange murders that let New York as a quiet hamlet. Sure, that gives to inspector Wallander the opportunity to demonstrate his high ability and intelligence as policeman, philosopher, etc. We, as readers must accept that literary license. <br />     We see, I spite to have to face terrible criminals Wallander very rarely carries his ordnance handgun. He drives too much his old and re - repaired Peugeot, delegates very little the most routine tasks, earns a low salary, sleeps very bad and very little and he's constantly sick and tired after many journeys of almost 24 hours of hard work. He resists all that by drinking a big amount of coffee, doesn't disdain whisky, eats usually cheap tasteless hamburgers and pizzas, all very fast and very bad and so, he suffers some diarrheas, and he's overweigh and prone to diabetes. Summing up, Kurt Wallander isn't Mike Hammer: he's humane, so humane, that if truly necessary he's able to knock out with a powerful punch to an adversary. He's constantly consternated by the cases he has to solve. He's truly a pacific man and doesn't like his profession but he simply doesn't know another thing to do in life.  <br />   And there, it does very well: the reason is Wallander possess an extraordinary sharpened instinct for true or false things and words, a rare ability to relation spare words, declarations apparently unconnected, and a deep knowledge of human being and human situations. That is worth more tahn a revolver. These abilities I think aren't fully innate: you need to have experience of living, looking, and capacity to learning from it. In effect, personal and familiar problems of Swedish society are omnipresent. In this novel Wallander has to solve the murder of two Latvians in a small boat at derive. That goes him to find a love with a Latvian woman. In Spain we have much Swedish and Scandinavian people living here almost permanently with a good standard of life while Russians and Baltic people are economically in poor situation, but the novel reveals truly these Northern people seems very near in character and mood.   <br />
B0007P3582|3.0|Following up one of the biggest debuts in hip-hop history, crack dealer turned charisma dealer 50 Cent makes some bold moves, recycles plenty of old ideas, and sprinkles in some perfect party singles for The Massacre. Crafty man that he is, 50 must have known following up the massive Get Rich or Die Tryin' was going to be extremely difficult, especially for a rapper rightfully known more for creating headlines than rhymes. To cushion the blow, 50 released an album by his G-Unit crew, made numerous guest appearances on other artist's tracks, and helmed ten mixtapes in his G-Unit Radio series. It kept the debut momentum moving and it's half the reason why The Massacre doesn't feel like Get Rich's proper successor, the other half being the album's effortless attitude. That's the most frustrating thing about the otherwise satisfying Massacre. At worst, it feels unfinished, and at best, it feels like a mixtape cobbled together from mostly choice tracks but without that overseer's polish. At a stunning, slightly overstuffed 78 minutes, it's overwhelming, too, but without a perfect flow to hold the listener's hand the whole way through, it's also a testament to 50 and crew that The Massacre doesn't test your patience until after the one-hour mark. Silly and short intro out of the way, the slinky \\"In My Hood\\" gets down to business and gives way to four tracks of the same-old, same-old bravado and beats that are still just as stunning and catchy as hell. \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\" and \\"Gatman and Robbin\\" are both great tracks from the quirky/macabre house of Eminem, but it's the Fat Joe-dissing \\"Piggy Bank\\" that steals the show. Like \\"Candy Shop,\\" \\"Outta Control,\\" \\"Disco Inferno,\\" and on and on, \\"Piggy Bank\\" succeeds because of its serviceable rap, believable swagger, inescapable hook, and phatter than phat beats. For those who've had it with the gunshots, the ShadyAftermath boasting, and the usual \\"G-G-G-G-Unit!\\" shouts, The Massacre has just enough surprises. Besides mentioning Kurt Cobain and Ozzy Osbourne, \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" is the big shocker as 50 poignantly tells the tale of a heroin-addicted girlfriend destroying all that's good. \\"Ryder Music\\" is more easygoing than expected, \\"Build You Up\\" is actually sweet, and \\"God Gave Me Style\\" has just about the dreamiest beat in the G-Unit universe. Scott Storch, Dr. Dre, and Eminem are the only big names in the producer's chair, but everyone else serves up fine tracks, especially the great Needlz. Guest spots are kept to a bare minimum and besides the intro, skits are nonexistent. Trim a couple tracks and a couple beefs and rearrange the album and you have what sounds like Get Rich's lesser sequel, but The Massacre doesn't look back. It really just wants to challenge other rappers' albums and not its predecessor. Taken that way, it's a good effort overall.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril has a crappy punk voice, that only idiots that were brought up in main stream america would condider, and even they would be sick!!!! She is almost as worst as the lead singer of the rolling stones, who can't even sing to save his life. If you want to buy a female singer album consider lumidee, jlo, or boyonce
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I've been waiting for another TMV CD ever since hearing \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" a few years ago. These guys are amazing and never cease to amaze me with their insane talent and wide variety of styles. I would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone. ~ Cacoon
B0007O38F8|5.0|Okay it seems that a lot so stuff is now being heard about what is happening behind the scenes of aftermath and g unit.  But this much is clear that 50 cent did not have as much help form Dr.Dre as he would have liked.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons The Game is no longer part of Guint.  However there is no doubt that 50's new album will exceed sales his freshmen album.  The only question is how many times over.  As for those who say that the date of the album was being pushed back was useless should know by all the mixtapes out there that 50 had already finished all the tracks.  It is evident that the wise men of aftermath/shaddy/guint felt that the release of the Massacre in feb would out shadow the sales of The Game's Documentery.  It's the same reason why DJ Whoo Kid doesn't have a Gunit radio mixtape every week.  It's possible just to throw albums and mixtapes out all the time.  But if the market is flooded by it then there is no hype or appeal.  After all, other than 50 cent and his crew of Yayo, Banks and Buck, this whole thing is about sales and money$$$$
B0007O38F8|1.0|Just like every other commercial rap album 50 cent's \\"Massacre (coll) (dig) (spkg) \\" falls flat with weak tracks and boring lirycs from 50 cent and the only thing plus about 50? Is the conterversy that surrounds him but nothing else...Come on, he dissed nas, jada,fat joe and those guys been doing hip-hop thats from the street...So if you support 50? That means you dont support real hip-hop! Peace !

B0007O38F8|4.0|Personally I liked this album just as much as I like GRODT. <br />out of the 21 songs on this album I can say I dont like about 5 songs. I wasnt expecting this ablum to be the same as the first because by now any real music fan should now that it will never compare. Jay-z's reasonable doubt is far better than any album he released  after and NAs has not released any good album since his first so I think that it is important to be realistic. I have been reading alot of these reviews and somehow I get the feeling that most of the people here did not actually buy the album and not even 50 fans I see that there are some honest reviews but I think that alot of them are just bored aint- 50, anti- gunit people who want to hate. I think 50's biggesr problem is he is far better the rapper than he allowas people to see I see a song like \\"baltimore love\\" and \\"Hate or love it\\" and I know that it doesnt have to be about guns and drugs all of the time. I think 50 need to let people see the \\"Real\\" person and not the hard shell on the outside. <br />ALl things considered this is a really good album <br /> <br />Into-didnt like it but not going to rate it. <br />i'm hood- 2/5 <br />This is 50- 4/5 <br />I'm gonna die tonight-4/5 <br />piggybank- 4/5 <br />gatman & robbin- 2/5 (the worst song on the album) <br />candy shop- 4/5 <br />outta conttol- 3/5 <br />get in my car- 5/5 <br />ski mask way- 4/5 <br />baltimore love thing- 3/5 ( dont really like the execution of the topic maybe could have changed his voice up a lil) <br />Ryder music- 3/5 a lil boring  <br />disco inferno- 5/5 <br />just a lil bit- 5/5 <br />gunz come out- 2/5 <br />my toy soldiers- 5/5 ( I like yayo's part) <br />postion of power- 3/5 <br />build you up- 4/5 (thought jaime could have sounded better) <br />god gave me style- 4/5 (couldnt stand it at first now I love it  <br />so amazing- 5/5 ( I love this song) <br />dont need em- 2/5 <br />hate it or love remix 5/5 <br /> <br />
B000002JSN|5.0|Review number 275. Originally released in 1975, 'Physical Graffiti' is said by some to have been Zeppelin's last great album. It is - of course the band's sixth opus. Except, if you wish to include a couple of those later compilation discs. Hadn't heard most of the cuts on this outstanding double-disc gem for awhile now. Have always fully enjoyed the bluesy \\"Custard Pie\\", the eleven-minute \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" (with Page's whining guitar work-love it!), the snazzy \\"Trampled Under Foot\\", the Middle Eastern-influenced and unforgettable \\"Kashmir\\", the heavenly \\"In The Light\\" as well as a couple of the lp's acoustic pieces \\"Black Country Woman\\" and \\"Boogie With Stu\\". Total of fifteen songs, with a duration of approx. 82 minutes. Simply a must-have. Another great 2-CD offering, their 'Led Zeppelin-Box Set 2' (see my review).
B000001EAQ|5.0|U2 is my favorite band and I think they will always be. My favorite album is still the Joshua Tree but Pop is a VERY close 2nd. It's a very brightly colored package with a not so sweet taste as Bono once put it. It's true, the lyrics on this album are darkly cynical and in my opinion, Bono's absolute best. I will reccommend this album to any music fan. Take into consideration that \\"Pop\\" demands an open mind like many masterpieces do. It takes a few listens before the genius sets in but once it does, look out. This could become one of you're favorite albums by them.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend CAN sing. No doubt. If one thing in life is certain, it's that fact. If he got any better, he'd be Marvin Gaye or Stevie Wonder. They don't sound the same, but you get the idea. John sings R&B the way it should be sung, with incredible power and emotion. Very few can even capture that quality. Finally, there is someone that you can actually call a legend before his time. If you like GREAT R&B, get this album.  <br />
B00005JMYI|2.0|I always thought of will ferrell as a supporting character from his time on SNL where I loved some of his work but I never saw him as being capable of carrying a lead role. Anchorman vindicated this view.  I couldn't sit through the whole thing it was simply too dumb. not funny dumb just dumb. I honestly felt cheated of my rental fee. I would recommend old school if you need a ferrell fix but this was just crap.
0385510454|1.0|The one star because the book, as everything Grisham writes is well written and ligustically quite stylish. Apart from that it's probably the worst book he's ever done. The plot (really too strong a word) is completeley linear and obvious. It becomes clear very early what will happen to the main character, and there are no surprises on the way. The book is an excuse for Grisham to tell the world about the wonders of Bologna -where he clearly has had a great time, and for that (especially since Grisham has his character quote from one all the time) a guidebook is a better bet.  <br /> <br />The city is marvellous, so I can understand the temptation, and a lot of authors, Grisham included (e.g. in \\"A painted house\\") make the \\"place\\" and integral part of the story. Graham Greene did it all the time (with Saigon, Havana and Spain to name a few, and John le Carr is a master (Moscow in the Russia House, Panama in the Tailor etc..) but here this doesn't happen at all. I'm not saying Grisham should stick to the courtroom - \\"A painted house\\" is in my opinion one of his best - but wait until he's got something to write about, a story to tell, before telling it. Or as Chris Rock put it at the Oscars: \\"If you want Russel Crowe and all you can get is Colin Farrell - WAIT! This one just doesn't cut it.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Its really good to watch a Hepburn film where she's not playing a demure princess.And she displayed her good acting talent in this one. <br />    Audrey Hepburn palys a newly blind woman who was left in a house by her husband and who was being terrorized by a group of nasty men trying to retrieve a doll inside her house filled with drugs.Its up to her to save herself with a little help from a little girl next door.Richard Crenna's character pretends to be an authority trying to help her to get inside the house easier  but they somehow couldnt find the doll.The men inside her house seem to be acting strange (she hears somebody wiping the furniture all over the living room) then she realized theyre up to something. <br />   The highlight of the film is when she's trying to save herself (breaking all the light bulbs so they would be equal) from the killer Alan Arkin. <br />   I saw this one rainy day and it added to the suspense.This is one of the greatest suspense movies ive seen.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|I just had a few comments to make on the historical facets of the film, mostly on the differences between the movie account and the actual historical accounts, since I happen to know something about that.<br /><br />This is one of those wonderful movies that burns itself into your memory, never to be forgotten. Newman and Redford were at the peak of their fame when they teamed up to do the movie, and the chemistry between them is much of what makes the film so memorable. In real life, Cassidy was said to be the truly amiable bandit he was portrayed to be in the movie, while Sundance was the laconic loner, a man who had no other friends except for his buddy, Cassidy. Redford admits to being a stubborn and individualistic Scotsman, so it was felt the role suited him, just as Newman's more outgoing and extroverted personality seemed to fit the Cassidy role.<br /><br />Cassidy was born in Utah in 1866 to Mormon parents, taking a different last name so as not to shame his family. He was naturally fearless and courageous, and with his quick wit and natural charm, apparently had no trouble recruiting cohorts to assist him in his daring robberies. He quickly became known as a master planner of train, mine, and bank robberies and his fame grew accordingly.<br /><br />Sundance was born in Pennsylvania in 1867 but headed west with his family when he was 15. His life of crime started when he was 20 when he stole a horse, saddle, and a gun, and was caught and spent 18 months in jail. He then tried going straight and worked as a ranch hand for a couple of years, but the honest life of a cowboy apparently didn't suit him, and eventually teamed up with Butch. In 1900, they robbed the Winnemucca National Bank in Nevada.<br /><br />As the west become more civilized and law enforcement became more organized, he and Sundance and Etta finally headed east and departed for South America, where they purchased a ranch in Patagonia, Argentina, which they farmed for a few years. They quickly tired of the rigors of the ranch life (there was a comment to that effect in the movie, although they never actually got the ranch), and eventually they returned to easier methods of making money robbing banks and mine payrolls until they were trapped by the Bolivian troops as portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />However, a different story says that the troops killed another pair of bandits and that Butch and Sundance escaped and eventually died natural deaths living under several aliases that are attributed to them, but no-one really knows to this day what really happened to the famous bandito duo. In fact, even after they were reported killed by the Bolivians, the Pinkerton detectives continued to pursue them for several years, since their bodies were never identified.<br /><br />The movie plays a little fast and loose with some of the historical facts. In real life, Etta was probably one of the girls from the brothel rather than a schoolteacher. But other than that, nothing much is known of her, and the only photo known is the one taken in New York before they got on the ship for Bolivia. However, the part about the discovery of the mule from the mining operation is apparently true and how they were finally cornered.<br /><br />In the movie, they go to Bolivia, but they actually went to Argentina, as I mentioned, but then this wasn't known until recently. Two historians, Anne Meadows and Daniel Buck, travelled to Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile, and located hundreds of still extant police records, judicial transcripts, newspaper articles, eyewitness accounts, and letters covering the exploits and fates of the two famous bandits.<br /><br />The group was actually known by a number of names, not just the Hole in the Wall Gang. During their heyday, the band was referred to in the newspapers as the Robbers Roost gang, Hole-in-the-Wall, the Train Robber's Syndicate, Kid Curry's gang, the Powder Springs gang, Butch Cassidy's gang, and the Wild Bunch. The first recorded useof the \\"Wild Bunch\\" was in a 1902 Pinkerton memorandum sent to the American Bankers Association.<br /><br />Finally, neither Butch or Sundance were real gunslingers. There isn't a single gunfight attributed to them and Sundance was almost certainly not the blindingly fast quick-draw expert portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />However, Butch and Sundance holing up in the mountain town of San Vicente the night of their deaths is likely accurate.  They had planned the holdup of the Aramayo mine company payroll rather hastily, since their previous plan to hit the Tupiza bank had been foiled by the arrival of army troops who were there on training maneuvers.<br /><br />After the holdup, word spread much faster than Butch and Sundance could have anticipated, and they were unable to continue on their course south and cross the Argentine border. Their scheme frustrated, they circled west and north, which had the advantage of putting a mountain range between them and most of their pursuers.<br /><br />The result was that only two days after the holdup they were now high in the cold, dry air of the Andes without adequate cold-weather clothing and gear, and perhaps more importantly, without foor or water for their horses. Forced to go into the village where conditions were more hospitable, they undoubtedly thought that San Vicente was remote and small enough so that there would be very little chance of finding a posse there. Unfortunately, they were wrong.<br /><br />Well, I didn't mean to wax so nerdy on the history. It's still one of the greatest movies from the period, despite the considerable artistic license that was taken with some of the facts.first recorded use of the \\"Wild Bunch\\" was in a 1902 Pinkerton memorandum sent to the American Bankers Association.  <br /> <br />Finally, neither Butch or Sundance were real gunslingers.

B0007O38F8|1.0|50 cent owns everybody who bought this album an apology and a refund coz this is one of the worst rap albums of all timez. There is not even a song which can be listened to more than once. The G in G-unit stands for Garbage coz that is what this album is, trash, rubbish. If 50 wants to redeem himself he better make another album and give it away for free to anyone who shows up with a copy of this trash he put out. He owes everyone an apology for putting out bogus stuff like this and calling it an album. <br /> <br />On this album 50 makes it be known that if he continues on this path he will never be a legend but a one hit wonder. 50 aint even the best rapper on his own lable, Lloyd banks better than him, Young buck better than him and if 50 cent thinks that selling mo albums means u are the best than he is confused coz I have no doubt he might out sale the average rapper but he aint any better than the average rapper in my opnion he belongs in the catergory of the worst rappers who sell or better yet most over rated rapper
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|The plot is weak - but it looks good.  Gone is the high drama of the Iliad with it's contest of wills between the Greeks and the Gods, all of whom indulge their petty human (and intriguing) emotions.  This movie seems designed for one thing - to show off Brad Pitt as a sex symbol.  Brad Pitt's Achilles is dark, and even bloodthirsty at times, but not as manly as Russell Crowe's Maximus.  Manliness is sorely needed in this film (Bana, Pitt, and Bloom together don't pump as much testosterone as Mel Gibson in Braveheart).  Brian Cox as Agememnon and Peter O'Toole as Priam are the only acting performances of note.  Diane Kruger's Helen is mute and passionless - and she's the reason for all the to-do?  But the musical score is very good - especially for the climactic fight between Pitt and Bana- and the scenery is magnificent.  Rent it - one watching will be enough.
0385510454|1.0|This has to be one of the worst books even penned by Grisham. The novel starts out nicely with some suggestions of great possibilities to follow. However, it soon becomes an Italian travelogue and introduction to Italian culture, cuisine and language. <br /> <br />Where has the real Grisham gone? The person who \\"wrote\\" (I use the term loosely) this book could not be the same person who gave us Client or A Time To Kill and other legendary legal crime thrillers. <br /> <br />A bust.
B00005JLIU|4.0|A rather complex and somewhat silly story of orpahn girls in white slavery is at the centre of this film, enter heaps of opportunity for farce,comedy, and hilarity, particualry as twists and double twists ensue around the characters portrayed by Fox, Channing and Moore.<br /><br /> Julie Andrews is at her best in terms of vocal dexterity and high camp comedy, she lets the role slip a little by playing the all American girl with the clipped BBC accent?? Didn't work for me anyway! Channing did well with the awards on this film but in my opinion it should have been Lillie. Channing is loud and excruiatingly irritating, Lillie in contrast is extremely witty and her comic timing is spot on.
B000002HIK|3.0|You cannot dance to this album, it's structure is not one that is easily found. I would call it ambiance music with an erratic beat that is impossible to follow. I would call it calming chaos. I would call it a nice change from some of the mass marketed bilge that is being produced these days. I recomend buying it and putting it on for a nice backround ambiance that is reminiscent of machinery, space, and the future.
B0004Z33EQ|3.0|Recently I watched this movie, it was fun but filmwise \\"DUMB\\". Come on why would anyone love seeing action and explosions instead of \\"PLOT\\" and \\"CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\\" like in the amazing First Blood before it.
1869504917|1.0|We just returned from New Zealand.  My wife and I are big fans of the Lord of the Rings movies.  While traveling on the South Island, we planned to visit several of the locations used in the movies, thus we believed this guidebook would be essential. <br /> <br />It sucks!!  We have used a lot of guidebooks in my travels and this takes the prize as THE worst.  Although we were very familiar with the movies and had read the books, because we did not have INTIMATE knowledge of New Zealand, the book was very, very difficult to use. <br /> <br />Its biggest flaw is its maps.  There are few in the book.  When people write guidebooks, they will include numerous and detailed maps showing the location of hotels, trails, or even views (see Lonely Planet and Moon guidebooks for good examples).  The maps in this book show you nothing other than generalities.  We would have loved detailed maps, showing the exact place of filming locations.  Yes, I understand that some of the movie was shot on private property, and no, we were not going to trespass.  The book could have easily indicated which locations we could have visited.  The one detailed map in the book (of Deer Park outside of Queenstown) was directly cribbed from the handout at the park. <br /> <br />The book has GPS co-ordinates.  So what.  Of the hundreds of tourists we met while in New Zealand, only one had a GPS receiver--and he was a Kiwi.   <br /> <br />The guidebook does have some nice pictures, but they were of little help. <br /> <br />The guidebook does have some background about the story of Lord of the Rings, but that was unhelpful when trying to find a film location.  <br /> <br />The index is poor. <br /> <br />Often this book refers to companies that can offer the traveler tours.  In places in the book, it reads more like an advertisement, than a guidebook. <br /> <br />It is obvious that the author, while knowledgable about Lord of the Rings, knows little about writing guidebooks. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this is the ONLY detailed guidebook to the filming locations of Lord of the Rings.  I sincerely hope someone writes another one so no one will have to suffer with this one ever again. <br />
0783221622|4.0|this, along with goodfellas, is scorsese's answer to copolla's godfather. like goodfellas casino takes the opposite tack of godfather, eschewing myth and bigger-than-life storytelling and characters to give us instead the real dirt on the gangsters and the casinos they looted, er, i mean operated. casino isn't quite as tight as goodfellas - after a fast start the story meanders a little in the middle. but it does have some fine acting by the 3 principles, especially stone. de niro plays a staid, 2-dimensional character but gives his usual fine performance. pesci reprises his goodfellas character and he's even more reckless and nasty, if that's possible. and you have to see what happens to him at the end!<br />an enjoyable film, not quite as tight as its close cousin, goodfellas, but very much worth seeing.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|The first collaboration between director Brian De Palma and Al Pacino since Scarface, Carlito's Way boasts one of the best performances to ever be captured from legendary actor Pacino.  The storyline can be summed up as a \\"what if Tony Montana wanted to go straight\\" kind of deal, and it works exceptionally.  When Carlito (Pacino) is released from prison at the beginning of the film, he vows to go straight and forever leave behind his criminal past.  He dreams of retiring to the islands with his estranged girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller), but that's easier said than done as he finds that not many people can leave a life of crime behind alive, and his loyalties may prove to be his undoing.  Carlito's Way is one of De Palma's best films, riding on Pacino's shoulders as he gives a knockout performance, while Sean Penn is perfectly cast as his sleaze ball lawyer.  All in all, if you've never seen this film, I strongly recommend it, and seeing a modern day acting legend like Pacino give his best is enough reason to see this.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I am not going to go on & on about this movie.  But I am sick and tired of all the people who are giving it only 1-star.  This movie is \\"5-star\\" worthy, action-packed, full of special effects, and I will quote someone else on this one, \\"just completely cool and awesome.\\" I think that says it all!
B00003CX9E|5.0|It's when Charley Kane (Wells) is singing with some girls at an office party about his name being Charlie Kane. THe rest of the film is excellent drama, told mostly in flashback. A film with a real point about desire, longing, journalism, romance, and the greart American success story.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|After watching this several weeks before this review, I finally brought myself to review this item. I have to admit, when I first watched it, I wasn't laughing. I knew it was funny, but for some reason it wasn't making me laugh. However, I looked back on the moments in the film, most of which I remember, and thought very fondly of them all. While most people will be praising the comedic side of this film, I was most impressed with the storyline and characters. This movie does have an obscure, rather odd plot. To quickly describe it, it's basically just a deep insight into the life of a nerd, that being the main character Napoleon Dynamite. Of course, from this unveils numerous side plots, the largest being Napoleon's friend running for Class President.<br /><br />I found the humour to be not filled wih hilarity, but quite suttle and witty. There are certain moments in the film that are especially funny, but no one stands out. The acting is strong, especially the lead role, and we get a great new style of comedy that few of us have ever seen before.<br /><br />Overall, this is a strong comedy, which is loved by most who see it. I recommend that any movie lover see it, and hopefull you'll appreciate it as much as I do. Definitely worth seeing.
B000002KNY|4.0|I agree completely with David Bradeley's review below. The first 8 tracks on this album are brilliant and beautiful songs. Unfortunately the album has a trio of weak songs at the end (Animals, Electric Guitar, Drugs) so I cannot rate it as highly as the first 2 flawless albums or the next one, the masterpiece \\"Remain in Light\\". People who love the Heads will love this album, but it's not my fav of theirs.
B0006B2A2E|2.0|I love \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\\" It's my favorite film from '04. I was eager to quickly purchase the DVD when it was first released - and I did so. <br /> <br />Less than a month afterwards they announced a new 2-Disc edition, which must be the record for the shortest-ever re-release (apart from simultaneous separate editions such as the \\"regular\\" edition of Ray and the \\"special\\" edition for the die-hard fans of the film). <br /> <br />At first I was very upset, and angry at the film studio for doing this. Then I saw the extra features on the 2-Disc edition: <br /> <br />- Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry <br /> <br />- Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue <br /> <br />- A Conversation with Kate Winslet and Director Michel Gondry <br /> <br />- Deleted & Extended Scenes <br /> <br />- Souvenir Booklet <br /> <br />First of all, the front packaging for the new DVD is awful. It's the same as the old one, but centered, with annoying critics' reviews highlighted all over the place. Second of all, the new features are, simply put, not worth the upgrade. There's already an Anatomy of a Scene on the original disc. Once you've seen one, you get the idea. Only the most die-hard of fans would find it worth upgrading just for this. The conversation with Kate Winslet and Gondry is just as bad as teh conversation with Jim Carrey on Disc 1 - boring and not insightful at all. \\"Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry\\" was also available before and the souvenir booklet isn't anything special. <br /> <br />I think this is the worst case of marketing ever. I love the movie. I'm disappointed in the DVDs - the commentary isn't very interesting, the bonus features are dull, and to my surprise the instantaneous release of the \\"special\\" edition is just as bad. <br /> <br />I'd give it five stars if they hadn't tried to rip everyone off with two editions. The difference between the normal edition of Ray and the special edition is that they were announced at the same time, and put onthe shelves at the same time. For those of us who bought Eternal Sunshine, we were not told until later that a Collector's Edition was going to be released - a month later of all things! - so it really upset me.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|Monty Python alumnus Terry Gilliam helmed this surprise masterpiece which features some of the finest performances in the careers of Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, and Brad Pitt.  James Cole (Willis) is \\"volunteered\\" to travel back in time to trace the origins of a virus that will wipe out most of the humanity on the planet, but as he is slingshotted back and forth through time he begins to question his sanity and his perceptions of reality.  Along the way he is incarcerated in a mental asylum under the care of a psychiatrist who is strangely drawn to him (Stowe), and he encounters a deranged inmate (an Oscar nominated Pitt) on his journey to uncover the truth.  Willis is superb in his role, words can't describe it alone.  Pitt however, is more than worth noting, and his nomination for Best Supporting Actor was more than well deserved (his characterization of Jeffrey bears a striking similarity, albeit a few cans short of a six pack, to another role of Pitt's in Fight Club as Tyler Durden).  Gilliam's direction is as fantastic as it ever was.  Even though he had a relatively modest budget for a major studio, his uncanny vision makes the film work.  In the hands of another director, 12 Monkeys would have been a failure, in Gilliam's hands we get a dark yet witty apocalyptic film with riveting performances and an unforgettable climax that must be seen to be believed.  Christopher Plummer also stars as Pitt's scientist father, and look for David Morse in a pivotal role.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I just recently saw this film and it blew me away. To me it was one of the most touching and magical films i have ever seen. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet did an excellent job in this movie.
0380778556|5.0|An amazing read! The story of a young girl who falls in love and marries a mysterious man who owns the mansion Manderly. I fell in love with Maxim de Winter immediately and loved the little quirks of the heroine (who goes un-named throughout). The descriptions are amazing - you can picture everything du Maurier describes; you can see Manderly. The heroine arrives at Manderly expecting happiness, acceptance, and love, but instead she finds a dark secret that almost tears her world in two. The book's climax keeps you at the edge of your seat. Read it!
B0007P3582|3.0|I am going to do a review with better judgement on this. <br /> <br />1) Intro - Nothing special <br />2) In My Hood - (1) - He seems too gun happy on this song. The beat isnt that great nor are the lyrics. Horrible way to start off. <br /> <br />3) This is 50 - (2) - The lyrics are elementary. Same with the chorus yet the beat is ok. Nothing to see here. This track shouldnt have been thought of anyway. <br /> <br />4) Im Supposed To Die Tonight - (4) - This song reminds me of Many Men in a way. I enjoy the beat and the lyrics are pretty good.  <br /> <br />5) Piggy Bank - (3) - So hes dissing Nas for getting married to Kelis? Dissing Jadakiss and Fat Joe for doing \\"New York\\" with Ja Rule? This guy is like 20 something and acting like an immature high schooler. Compared to Jay-Z's \\"Takeover\\" and Nas's \\"Ether\\", these lyrics are a joke. Only thing I like about this song is the beat. The chorus kinda sucks too. <br /> <br />6) Gatman and Robbin - (4) - At first the beat annoyed me but now I got used to it and its crazy. Eminem did a good job with the beat and his verse. <br /> <br />7) Candy Shop - (2) - Its just Magic Stick 2. Good beat, dont phase me though. <br /> <br />8) Outta Control - (4) - Great production by Dre even though the beat sounds like \\"Higher\\" and \\"G'd Up\\" mixed together. The lyrics arent anything special but its ok. <br /> <br />9) Get In My Car - (3) - Great production by Hi-Tek but 50 just talks about getting women to get into his car. Just stuff that plagues hip-hop today. <br /> <br />10) Ski Mask Way - (1) - I hate this song. Everything is wrong to me. Fill-in track. <br /> <br />11) A Baltimore Love Thing - (4) - Talks about a girl he was with who was addicted to heroin. I love the beat and I am also from B-more. <br /> <br />12) Ryder Music - (3) - Very soulful beat. Yet the amateur lyrics plague this too. <br /> <br />13) Disco Inferno - (1) - He doesnt even sing and I am not very fond of the beat. Another club song that was used on a tracksomeone else better could have been used on. <br /> <br />14) Just a Lil Bit - (2) - Good beat but the rest of the song sucks. <br /> <br />15) Gunz Come out - (3) - When I had this the 1st time, the beat just sounded dry and dull. But I grew into it. I actually like the chorus on this song. The song is about messing with his money, nothing new. <br /> <br />16) My Toy Soldiers - (4) - One of my favorite songs on the CD. I love this beat by Eminem, the chorus and Yayos spontaneous lyrics. I would give it a 5 if 50 said some better stuff. <br /> <br />17) Position of Power - (5) - Great lyrics and awesome beat.   <br /> <br />18) Build You Up - (5) - My favorite song on the CD feat. Jamie Foxx. Great song (by Scott Storch), words and chorus. This song has everything I enjoy in my opinion. <br /> <br />19) God Gave Me Style - (1) - Looks like God didnt give you a great CD. <br /> <br />20) So Amazing - (3) - I heard this beat somewhere before. The words arent that great. <br /> <br />21) I Dont Need Em - (1) - Worse song on the CD. He stole this beat from Ghostface Killah's song \\"Metal Lungies\\" on Pretty Toney Album. The words suck too. <br /> <br />22) Hate It or Love It Remix - (4) - Its ok but I like the 1st one better with just Game.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Phavorite Phreaking Phlick!  Phun plick phor phriends!  Phew!
B0001D0FTW|5.0|I never really bothered with Edguy for one reason or another. I love power metal but don't really like all the keyboards that to me weakens the power. Edguy has keyboards a little and some annoying double-bass drumming madness but it doesn't at all effect the excellence of this CD. Edguy's music is very powerful yet melodic. They remind me in places of Iron Maiden and countless others of the \\"old school\\" metal genre. My favorites on this CD are \\"Mysteria\\", \\"The Piper Never Dies\\", \\"Under The Moon\\", \\"Rise Of The Morning Glory\\", and \\"Navigator\\". All classic metal. I have been hooked on this CD after the 1st listen. Every song is good except for the sappy last song \\"The Spirit Will Remain\\". Otherwise, a flawless metal release. I highly recommend it.
B0007GADZO|5.0|I was first taken aback by Passion and Warfare when I was just a lad and a musician myself. The amazing riffs, the fluidity of the aural eminations. For me, it was a spiritual experience every time I listened to the album(still is). Plus the fact that Stu Hamm was on the album made it even more special for me, since he happens to be one of my major influences as a bass player. <br />But what about this album? Well, even though I liked his quick stint with VAI (although no one else seemed to) I have fallen out of touch with his solo offerings save for Alien Love Secrets (which IMO was no P&W although still a nice spin). Real Illusions: Reflections has put Vai back on top as a virtuoso and even shadows his mentor and long time hero of mine, Satch(Joe Satriani for the n00bs).  While I still enjoy Satch, his work as of late has not moved me as Vai has with Reflections. When I had heard about this new album I was intrigued, and when I heard that this was to be part 1 of 3 of a new set of instrumental wizardry (along with some well done vocals) I was chomping at the bit to get this album, hoping that he would bring me back to the P&W days of composition and moods that only he can strum up. Not only did he do that, he also has showed us how he has continued to mature with the addition of brass and full orchestrations blended seamlesly into his new menagerie of sonic elations that seem to flow effortlessly from his fingers. Then not only has he put together a fantastic set of music, he has brought in another great set of musicians to back him up. Billy Sheehan on bass, another master and David Lee Roth days alumn has joined him as part of the Breed (Vai's support and touring band). The other artists in support do a fantastic job as well and should be noted, although I want you to read the end... <br />If you're not really a fan, but are into any kind of rock music, buy this album, If you like other guitar gods but aren't necessarily a Vai fan, buy this album, if like musicaf any kind... you get the idea. And if you ARE a Vai fan... You MUST buy this album. Forget the MP3s and the downloads, go to the store - get the full version the way that it was meant to be heard. And if it turns out you don't like, it's because you haven't turned on your cd player yet.
B00018D44U|1.0|In a word, tepid.  Record labels and big-time publishers spend tons of money to tell us who to like.  You'd think they could afford to find the best of the best, but instead we get a halcion cover act like Norah Jones pushed on us in every outlet store, every bank, dentist office, funeral home, you name it. <br /> <br />As expected of a multiple Grammy-winning debut phenomenon, Jones is joined on her sophmore release by a bunch of hacks (including one of my former heroes, Dolly Parton) who for whatever reason are routinely convinced to latch on to the new so-and-so like so many algae to so many fungi. <br /> <br />The result?  A dreary, mid-tempo exhalation of dead hits, re-worked in the style of wonder bread soul.  I have nothing against Norah Jones' music, save its Big Brotherly pervasiveness and its exhausting lack of originality and charm.
B000028U0Y|5.0|My uncle taught me to be a Johnny Cash fan as a tot. He had me singing \\"Five Feet High and Rising,\\" \\"I walk the Line,\\" and others, before America put a man on the moon.  When this album came out, Mom was horrified by some of the content. She made a butchered version of it, on tape, that she saw fit for me to listen to.  Thank Heaven for CD's like this one, wheve  where every song and every aside, profane or otherwise, is included.  There are four live albums by Cash that I'm aware of, 3 of which I own. This one may be the best. If not, it's for one reason--the songs are sung much faster than their studio originals, and in some cases verses are clipped out. That's the one and only quibble.  The enthusiasm of the audience makes up for that, and the studio versions can be found, if you look around for them, on songs lik \\"The Wall,\\" and \\"dark as a Dungeon,\\" both of which were shortened for reasons not clear to me.  This album is a must have for Cash fans.
1401301010|4.0|Two big highlights of this book: <br /> <br />1. The language - sharp, funny, relaxed style, not convoluted, not trying too hard - the street language and the descriptions are hilarious <br /> <br />2. The tales of addiction - this is the core of the book, his description of his addiction. He doesn't dwell on the horrors, but he also doesn't get too religious in his sobriety - it's just a sympathetic, believable story. And  the insight into the lying, coniving mind of a 'dope fiend' makes great reading. <br /> <br />I love the description of the seedy motel on Sunset, with the wicked purple light out front - tempting even the most reformed addict. <br /> <br />
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This was long held as one of my favorite films (animated or not) and it was another of Miyazaki's films I knew only in subtitled form. Kiki's Delivery Service was another, and upon hearing the Disney dub of that film I could not stand to watch it, it just tore up that great movie. By Porco is another story. Michael Keaton especially has done a great job of capturing the essence of the Japanese performance and helps make the dub very watchable. For true film fans, nothing beats the original language for sense of character, especially with anime as Japanese voice actors approach the work with a totally different frame of mind, really serving the film and the characters over matching voice to mouth. I was happily surprised by this dub.
B00005QW5X|5.0|The Rocky Horror comparison is easy, I guess. Why? Well, it's a rock musical with transvestites in it, right? But it's much more than that. If you're a Rocky fan, and you watch Hedwig because you heard they're alike, expecting cult value, you'll probably be disappointed... even though Hedwig has more cult following than you'd expect, and in some places weekly screenings with costumes and audience participation a la Rocky are actually held. But Hedwig is much more than that. Aside from the truly great music (which I'll discuss in a minute) the story of Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a sad tale of surprising depth, encompassing loneliness, betrayal, sexual confusion and identity crises as well as a bit of simplistic but kindly treated Platonic philosophy, with a brilliant ending that leaves many question marks and is good for hours of debate and discussion. <br /> <br />Hedwig and the Angry Inch is certainly not, as some reviewers point out, a niche film to be enjoyed only by homosexuals - though I imagine you'd probably have some problems with it if you're particularly homophobic or conservative. As long as you're open-minded, Hedwig (meaning both the film and the character) has the power to appeal and to move everyone; I haven't seen the stage version - Many people say that other actors who played Hedwig were better than John Cameron Mitchell - but John is absolutely electrifying in this role, surprisingly appealing and charismatic, as well as recognizable (which is quite surprising when you're talking about a transvestite glam-rocker from East Germany), and he acts and sings with all his guts. The fact that he is also the writer and the director, I think, really shows and it's for the best; the film is very personal, and you can tell from his acting that the character is all his own. Miriam Shor and Michael Pitt are both amazing in the supporting roles. <br /> <br />Even if all of that doesn't work for you, the music is where the film really stands out, and it's alsothe biggest point of difference between it and Rocky. While Rocky was created and inspired by the glam rock scene, the music - with maybe a couple of exceptions, like the wonderful and biting 'Sweet Transvestite' - is the stuff of Broadway, or at least Off-Broadway. That's not putting it down; it was intentional. The music on the Rocky Horror Picture Show is for the most part musical parody, pop tunes of sarcasm and wonderful dark humor. The songs on Hedwig are much more serious business, and much more complex, too, and most of them sound like they might have been recorded by David Bowie at the very height of his career. The rockier, harder songs like 'Angry Inch', 'Exquisite Corpse' and the spectacular, show-stopping opener 'Tear Me Down' sound like Ziggy Stardust mixed with Iggy Pop and tossed twenty five years into the future, with heavenly power chords and thundering bass and drums; 'The Origin Of Love' is an amazingly beautiful epic rock ballad with gorgeous lyrics; 'Wig In A Box' is a spectacular pop song which is so catchy it would have made a mega-hit were it released in the 70s; and the closing song 'Midnight Radio' is so classic a power ballad that you'll find your hand immediately reaching for the lighter. The band is fantastic, they have a terrific sound and are all great musicians, but they let Mitchell have all the attention he deserves. By the way, the music used in the shooting is playback as is usually the case in such movies, but John's vocals were recorded live, and it shows in his very emotional and powerful performances that have the feel of a live concert. Also, each song - especially 'The Origin Of Love' and 'Wig In A Box' - is shot as a perfect video clip. The band members, though they are not actors, and hardly talk at all, all look great on film and are pretty funny guys, too. <br /> <br />In conclusion, let's just say it's a great film and get it over with. It's not a trash film, or a cult film, or a gay film. Just a great musical and a great film overall. I dare you not to run and buy the soundtrack after you watch it.
B000002KAT|5.0|It's easy to see join the club of Van Morrison enthusiasts when we're talking Astral Weeks.  Simply put, it is a record that reminds me why we make records:  to make us feel something.  From scratch.  Few cds in the collection have the ability to conjure me from a couch, but Astral Weeks' thrilling roughness, merciless grooviness and downright seriousness can actually make me dance without wondering how I look... which makes this record a dangerous one as well.
B0007O38F8|2.0|Really, in all honesty most of this cd just blows. There are a couple of people who think this cd is BETTER than Get Rich!!  C'mon, are you serious??? There is no possible way you can even compare them. Judging by the singles that came from this cd, I thought it was going to be awesome. NOPE, 50 just used up the only decent songs on the album to produce singles, minus a few other songs on the cd that are aight. So look at it like this, there are WAY MORE people that say that this cd sucks than people that like it. Save your money, listen to the OG's like Dre and EM. They made 50 anyway.
B0007O38F8|1.0|If 50 Cent is rap's MVP  <br />Then why the hell can't he make a good cd? <br />The lyrics are weak <br />And the beats don't hit <br />Don't buy this trash <br />Because it's simply $hit. <br />-Bryce <br />
B0006A9FMI|4.0|This DVD deserves all of the criticism it has gotten, the film however does not. I found this to be easier to understand than the first, excellent movie. Oshii's storytelling is always understated, always philosophical, and often provoking. This film has a lot to say about the nature of being human and it states its case in veery Japanese terms. You have to watch films like this a time or two to understand the deeper meanings, but the action scenes in this are really good and will certainly satisfy. And the making of helped to understand the series better, such as a reference to the the love story of Mokoto and Batou in the first film. I can't say I got THAT from Ghost 1, but that is how subtle Oshii films can be. Remember, America is the land of the blockbuster and as film audiences we are rarely challenged by American films. Some of the most popular anime also falls into American film standards. But there are all types of anime, and this film is certainly for an older, thoughtful crowd. I even thought this one better than the first.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|ok first, i like to tell people what other movies i am into so they know if they should disregard my review or not. my favorite movies are the likes of Garden State, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Harold and Maude, Saved, Fight Club, and anything else with honest emotion at the core. Humans run on emotions, and i like movies that can accurately depict them. Closer possibly has done this in the most riveting, heartbreaking, and accurate manner <br /> <br />I wont give away much of the plot, but the movie is mostly about infidelity. It mixes the emotions that come with sex and relationships so truly that it hits people like a knife. The four characters, Alice (Natalie Portman), Dan (Jude Law), Anna (Julia Roberts), and Larry (Clive Owen), all intermingle in different ways, sexually and heated. It is about the tragedy of it all, and how relationships always have their ups and downs, but when infidelity is in play, no one truly wins. <br /> <br />the four actors are nothing short of incredible. i havent seen acting that good in many movies, and they did this all without weird fantastic settings or incredibly big main characters. they were all ordinary characters in an ordinary setting, and they made it seem monumental. i couldn't say anyone was better than anyone else, because they all had different characters and scenes to play, different emotions to bring to the table. roberts, however, has brought her usual style and flare into a totally different region, and her often excoriating strikes are felt by the audience as well <br /> <br />probably my favorite aspect is that this movie is about sex in all forms and reasons. but there is not ONE sex scence. it isnt until you think about that u realize that because there is enough sexuality and tension to produce any picture you wanted. right down to the painfully strong stripper scence where portman and owen are as close to having sex as any in the movie, arent even allowed to touch. it isnt noticed if you are as affected by the movie as i was. <br /> <br />possibly one of my favorite movies of all time, anyone that doesnt take something away from it has never felt the things they so clearly emote
B000002PB2|4.0|I'll never forget the first time I heard Night Ranger's \\"Dawn Patrol.\\"  A couple of friends played \\"Don't Tell Me You Love Me\\" for me, and I was in air guitar heaven.  That track blazes!!  One of my friends said that it was incredible that two guitarists as good as Brad Gillis and Jeff Watson made it into the same band.  How true.  The best thing about this album is how it flows, maintaining a rocking yet melodic form throughout. I saw Night Ranger live in 1984 and again in 1999; they showcased their awesome talent as musicians on both occasions.  They sounded great live.  My favorite thing about this album is the unique guitar style of Brad Gillis.  As soon as you hear his expressive solos, you know it is him, wailing away on his red guitar. I think this album shows the group at its rockin' best, before the pressure to conform to radio based hits took its toll.  Check out \\"Can't Find Me a Thrill,\\" \\"Eddie's Comin' Out Tonight,\\" and \\"Night Ranger(the song)\\" for a chance to kick out the jams.  Catch you on the Dawn Patrol, my rockin' brothers & sisters.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|This album features everything. No matter what, this album has <br />everything you need. My favorites on this compilation are Darkness on the Edge of Town, Glory Days, Human Touch, The Rising, and Lonesome Day. Great CD if you are new to Bruce Springsteen. I've started out with The Rising first. <br />
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I first saw the badly dubbed US version of this film, Warriors of the Wind, when I was 13, but still fell madly in love with it. Since then, a love of anime and Miyazaki films has blossomed. Anyone open to Miyazaki's films will not be disappointed. And while I had been skeptical of Disney's hand in these films since I heard about it (and the poor dub of Kiki's Delivery Service not withstanding), the voice acting here is very good. The entire cast give this film the professional care and polish it deserves. I am very happy!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Well it embraces the jingoism of the age and is now heavily cliched but these things aside it is a terrific piece of entertainment and has been a cultural phenomenon. The jingoism and the the fact that is a popcorn move aside I just wanted give a few comments about the quality of the new Digitally remastered edition. I also have the original region 1 release and now own the region 4 remastered one.  I have to say the difference definately warranted the new purchase. I tend to watch DvD's on my computer screen which will show up poor screen transfers better than the TV will. The new release has a great picture and is cleaned up immensly. The DvD menu is terrific and the sound is a ripper which is really what you want with something like this. I am not a big fan of DvD extras as I tend to watch them once and be done with it as I buy the Dvd's for the films but the extra's disk here is definately interesting and some time as definately gone into it's presentation. All in all a fantastic effort. If you are considering a purchase then this is a top notch DvD. Just make sure you are ordering the remastered one.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|I'm sorry. But Frances the Mute is a big joke. They need to stay off the heroin. I can't believe this is the same band. I once defended them and said these guys are awesome and to give De-louse a chance because it was a breakthrough in music. Frances the Mute is just a very good editted recording of their live act and old material. The song cygnus, at the break down, that sequence was played in the live version of \\"drunkship of lanterns\\" about 2 years ago. They've run out of ideas and the Widow has got to be the worst song ever. It had potential when omar played with an acoustic in the bootlegs and liveshows, However have turned it into an overly produced track and the Mars Volta has lost their sound.     If you want another De-loused in the Comatorium, then this CD isn't it. I like to think that France the Mute never existed. Howver, I still enjoy De-loused, which has got to be the best creation of music ever made. This ugly transition made me lose hope for rock music. Very disapointed. If this is your first Mars Volta album, then go buy the Tremulant extended play or the De-loused album and see what I mean. It is because of De-loused that you may believe Frances is such a good CD. If De-loused never existed, Frances the Mute would not have sold. Not only is the music different from De-loused, it is too Hedonistic for its own good. Meaning it was created this way because it is what is \\"cool\\" to hear now. It's all mis-syncopated filtered out pop sounds that is not at it's potential in organization. Basically, they don't know what they're doing anymore. Poorly organized and wouldn't consider these songs. Personally, I think they are too influenced by Pink Floyd. I played De-loused on repeat since day one. I've only listened to this CD like 50 times, and it's just not that great.     And for those who defend the Mars Volta because you are a \\"die hard\\" fan--cough cough (heard them on kroq for the first time), are ignorant and need to lay off the grass and heroin. MarsVolta is dead and their won't be another album because Frances the Mute is what brought them to their demise.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Coyote is the best MK song ever! It totally rocks and calls to <br />be one of my favorite songs of all time. The horns in Coyote are <br />the best. The drums rule, Mark rules the whole song is just 6 <br />minutes of excellence. <br />Great song, buy this album just for that song.
B000002U9Y|2.0|Before you yell \\"sophmore jinx\\" at this album. Sure, there are only two really good songs here ( the Rick Wright penned \\"Remember a Day\\" and the group-written title track, a true showcase for each individual member's strengths ) that hold up to  repeated listening. But what must be remembered is that the Floyd's main singer and songwriter Syd Barret ( who was largely responsible for the genius first album )  was in the middle of a complete and utter mental breakdown due to copious ingestion of psychedelic drugs when this album was recorded, and was all but absent from the recording, having been effectively replaced by vocalist/guitarist David Gilmour. Read one of the many Pink Floyd biographies for the lurid details, then listen to this album and cut 'em some slack, for God's sake.
0671027387|4.0|Dan Brown has 4 tremendous books out to date, and I eagerly await his upcoming soon-to-be masterpiece, \\"The Solomon Key.\\" Until that time, if you are a lover of the adventures of Robert Langdon in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons,\\" I recommend you read this book as well. While it does not contain any more adventures from our favorite hero of modern literature, it does contain a plot that is not that much of a stretch of the truth; in fact, something akin to what happens in this book surely has happened in the modern political landscape before us today, full of all its deceit, treachery, unholy alliances, and money-driven policies.<br /><br />  This book, though not as masterful as \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" or \\"Angels and Demons,\\" is well worth your purchase and read. You will not be disappointed. As with his other books, there are innumerable twists and turns in this plot, all clever and well thought out, not tacked on to create diversions or length. The book does not drag on, as it is cleverly timed and crafted to keep both suspense and interest high throughout.<br /><br />  In short, I recommend this book to all lovers of Dan Brown, of good fiction in general, and suspense thrillers in general.  All will be pleasantly surprised and find this quite enjoyable. Don't take the 4 stars the wrong way, its just that with his other two masterpieces warranting 5 stars, this one is just a slight notch below them, really its closer to 4 1/2 stars. Pick a copy up and give it a try!
B0006213WG|5.0|First off I would like to tell all of these reviewers that they should find out what each of their CD's was produced for. Even if some do not have a deeper meaning to their existence. Only until you have the true info on why each CD was produced, lets try not to criticize the bands too much. <br /> <br />Sum 41 went from All Killer, No Filler (which just happened to be a killer album) to Does This Look Infected? (which was an ok album for them) and then they produced Chuck. Chuck is an amazing album that really connects with the roots of their inspiration from bands like Iron Maiden and Metallica. Knowing that this album was produced while Sum 41 was on their trip to Africa can help one figure out why this album sounds so meaty and hardcore. Obviously the trip to Africa changed their lives, seeing how the CD is named after the guy who practically saved their lives while in Africa. All in all this album is amazing, anyone who is a Sum 41 fan should agree. Keep up the amazing work Sum 41.
B000002JS6|5.0|This album by acdc is awesome. Most of the tracks are really good <br />on this album. Highway to Hell is also a great album. Brian Johnson to me isn't really that bad. The best tracks are Hells <br />Bells, Shoot to Thrill, Given the Dog a Bone, Back in Black, <br />You Shook Me All Night Long, & Have a Drink on Me. Awesome CD.
B000002U8G|5.0|After the departure of Pink Floyd's main singer/songwriter and defacto leader Syd Barret, the band were in a state of flux.  Full of highlights to be sure, subsequent Floyd albums were largely hit and miss. And then came Meddle. The opener \\"One of These Days\\" rivals any heavy rock song made in the last 35 years, the eerie sound of wind and an approaching storm leading into double tracked bass, heavy percussion and slide guitar, climaxing with the distorted vocal of drummer Nick Mason - \\"one of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces\\". The next few tracks are soothing, pastoral tone poems. A lite jazz number \\"San Tropez\\" ( with lyrics mocking the rich rock star life many assumed the Floyd lived, although they hadn't yet, as Dark Side of the Moon was still  a few years away ) comes as a bit of a shock to those casual fans used to the \\"rock\\" side of the Floyd. Side one closes with \\"Seamus\\" , a blues number made even more effective by the sound of a sad, howling dog providing \\"backing vocals\\". Side two is where the real journey begins. So much has been said about \\"Echoes\\" I think it impossible to add anything useful, or more persuasive, to the argument of its importance and influence. A side long suite, it is the perfect example of a modern rock symphony. Repeated motifs, using different instruments and effects, are sprinkled throughout this 20-odd minute journey. The lyrics are great( read them, they make a hell of a lot of sense ) and the packaging is an art masterpiece. A highlight in the Floyd cannon. Very Highly Recommended.
0312263120|5.0|I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars, but just because I love Dan Brown's masterful writing and ability to create and nurture a story, I chose to give it 5 stars instead of 4. This book is not perfect, but it is close, and it certainly warrants a read by anyone who enjoyed any of Dan Brown's other books, anyone who enjoys suspenseful thrillers in general, anyone interested in the internal workings of our secret behind-the-scenes government, as well as any reader of excellent books in general. <br />As I have noted in my other reviews of Dan Brown's works, he is THE new master of fiction. Previously, I had been a lover of non-fiction books from Nietzsche, Krishnamurti, and other deep and moving authors who pushed my cognitive abilities to their absolute limits, but serendipity lead me astray about a year ago to a most unexpected and most wonderful treasure. That treasure is Dan Brown. <br />Dan Brown is one of the most intelligent and witty writers out there; simply put, he is a page-turner extraordinaire. He creates and nurtures characters full of color and depth, and throws them into historical-religious plots and ancient-yet-modern settings that push them to discover things about the world and themselves that for whatever reason, is so interesting that you desire to see what's on the following page until you notice that many hours have passed and you had become completely absorbed into a world so compellingly real you were almost there. His books are that good. <br />Specifically, with regards to Digital Fortress, the NSA is under attack from an encryption code that, on one hand, could bring down their whole operation, but on the other hand, could make it so our government could intercept, read, and analyze every piece of information that traveled on the internet (i.e. - all the information in the modern world). Its a very smart plot, with a good basis in reality, with a lot of factual information about high-end technology, digital spying and encryption, and the government's role in \\"protecting\\" us - and how one woman on the inside deals with that reality, that pressure, and all the technical and personal problems that the job entails. <br />In short, this is a fabulous book by one of the best authors of fiction out there today. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED YOU PURCHASED THIS BOOK, NOR WILL YOU REGRET THE TIME SPENT READING IT. It is just a slight notch below the quality of \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" and better than his other book, \\"Deception Point.\\" ALL IN ALL, A MUST READ.
B00079HZUM|5.0|it is a triumph of storytelling, historical fact, awesome cinematography, uncanny costumes, great locales, and some truly remarkeable performances by billy cruddop, clare danes, tom wilkenson, and especially rupert everett in the bawdy role of a lifetime, he should have at least garnered an oscar nomination for his splendid performance!  oh the glorious sound, the incredible clarity and beauty of this particularly pristine print so beautifully transferred on to the dvd. the film is a riot, it's deeply profound, and deeply moving as well. great theatre meshed together into one gorgeous, sumptious dvd. not to be missed you will simply love it, no time for popcorn and soda here. rent it or buy it but watch it at least twice. bravo..................

B00005JL2O|3.0|I agree with some reviewers that said that the third installment of Austin Powers doesn't live up to its reputation. The first time around, it was genius! The second time around, it was clever and hilarious funny when Minnie Me and Fat B. came along! And the third..eh, a little too hyped up if you ask me. The beginning was awesome. But the only problem is that there were too many camios, many in which didn't even have to be needed (such as Britney Spears? And the funny thing about her entrance is how it look as if she can't even lipsync properly in a movie either). But the beginning of the film was the funniest part of the whole movie if you ask me. But then everything starts to die down a bit with all the bathroom humor, which to me seems a bit childish, something that only little boys would laugh at. But at least there was an effort to build a real plot for this film, instead of just relying solely on camios and bad jokes. Many sequals don't even come close to even trying to build SOME kind of plot that has some relevence to the film itself. But all in all, this film is good for a few laughs. But i wouldn't actually buy it. The novelty has worn off with this third installment. But still, great entertainment.
1400043662|2.0|I once counted the days 'til the new Murakami translation hit the racks. (Or the computer screens.) Now, it's like receiving a telegram -- dread accompanies the opening. \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" is not particularly awful -- unless you keep in mind as you read it the past greatness(\\"Wind Up Bird Chronicle\\") of this writer. He has morphed into the worst sort of Designer Fictionist, with a dollop of cranky right-wing politics dropped in. (The scene with the feminists invading the sovereign state of Komura Library is easily the worst scene Murakami has written. And why did the lost love of the book's heroine have to be beaten to death by a bunch of leftist Japanese students? Why not by the police, the school administration, or the Yakuza? Beating up on feminists and 1960s revolutionaries: hey, now there's a brilliantly brave thing to do in the midst of the Bush Reich.) Murakami spends more time(MUCH more) describing the Nike shoes, and Lauren cardigans, and Opus One wine, and Piaget pens, and borsalino jackets, and Armani belts, and . . . well, you get the picture. What you do not get is the slightest freshness of character, wit or idea. You have a know-it-all 15-year-old kid, a retarded yet infinitely wise old man, a dreamy 50-something Japanese woman, and other not very interesting types. Throughout the whole book, Murakami skims. Politics, classical music, surfing, Kafka(the writer), classic cars, architecture, the history of the Pacific War -- Murakami touches on all of it and brings nothing to life, or to mind - except the definite adoration he has for his own thought process. (And his sex scenes are truly annoying, written as if by someone who's never actually done it.) By page 300 of this 400-plus page book, you'll stop caring, and you'll lose all patience with the New Age ramblings of the various characters. The once great writer has become a poseur. A genuine tragedy.
B00000720W|4.0|\\"Deathcrush\\" is one of those items which hold a godly status among the underground Metal adepts. Most times this blindly worshipping feedback appears to be determined by totally non-musical factors, yet Mayhem's first \\"proper\\" release stands high on the top of its unquestionable historical significance.<br /><br />The year was 1987, and when anyone mentioned \\"extreme Metal\\", everybody would think \\"Reign In Blood\\", of course. At the same time, however, the forefathers of Black Metal were busy pushing the insane aggression of Thrash to new extremes, a courageous attitude which would ultimately give birth to two genres: Death Metal and Black Metal. \\"Deathcrush\\" is one of the most significative documents of this evolution. It's a short, hit-and-run, less than twently minutes slab of pure aggression, where classic elements of Thrash are defiled by what could be described as the seeds of Black/Death by today's standards, but out by a bunch of not excessively skilled musicians who definitely knew what they wanted. At the time, this sounded like pure insanity, and today, the effect still refuses to wear off.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the album opens with a kind of \\"melodic\\" drum machine track named \\"Silvester Anfang\\", composed for the band by Conrad Schnitzer. Mayhem have always been weirdos, no doubt about it. But then the title track kicks in, and it's compromiseless Metal insanity. The first riff is actualy pretty interesting (and, most importantly, just plain cool) with its odd tempo; Euronymous basic guitar buzz is well backed by Necrobutcher's distorted bass sound, the result being a harsh bu rather thick sound. The drums, despite Manheim's rather sloppy playing (well, nobody in the band really shines at this stage), have a clear and strong sound, which has just one drawback: it tends to drown out the guitars and bass... Maniac's vocals, finally, are full of reverb in true eraly Black Metal tradition, sound (thankfully) nothing like the gibberish puking he's been spewing out since the band's reunion; he uses a very high pitched and insane shrieking (think of Varg Vikernes on heavy drugs), which fits the mood of the songs pretty well. Anyway, the song soon turns into a very fast blasting fest, with none in the band strictly following a precise tempo, but the effect is dang shattering anyway... I wonder how people did react to this at the time.<br /><br />\\"Chainsaw Gut----\\" opens with a slow distorted bass riff, soon joined by drums and guitars; this song is the slowest of the lot, and is built on an interestingly tempoed riff similar to the one used on the opening riff in \\"Deathcrush\\". Original and effective - who needs technical perfection when we have these qualities?<br /><br />\\"Witching Hour\\" is a Venom cover which best exemplifies how Mayhem crafted their unique sound by enhancing the madness found in their sources of inspiration... more in depth, the rendition of this song is FAST (just compare it with the original and see for yourself... and keep in mind that the year was 1987). Original session vocalist Messiah appears as a guest on this one, and unlike on the \\"Pure F------- Armageddon\\" demo, we can hear his vocals, which aren't that special (a kind of low and rather breathy spoken voice) but make a nice contrast with Maniac's banshee-like screams (don't miss that chilling \\"Witching hoooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrr!!!!\\" at the end!).<br /><br />\\"Necrolust\\"... this song alone pioneered a whole new style of playing. It opens with a little neat mid-paced, palm muted riff (Celtic Frost was the band's main inspiration along with Venom), but soon turns into a relentless assault of insanely fast riff. Ceaseless beats and razor sharp picking, and unearthly screams to top the whole thing - isn't it a bit the formula of modern raw Black Metal?<br /><br />\\"(Weird) Manheim\\" is a short and indeed weird \\"distorted piano\\" (at least it sounds like that) interlude which leads into the epitome of aggression... \\"Pure F------- Armageddon\\". This song is just what the title says: after a short and great thrashy beginning, noise begins (of course not the terrible kind of noise). Definitely one of the (if not the) 100% compromise free slabs of Metal ever put together. Vocalist Messiah handles this one by himself, as he already did on the demo of the same title... it's ok, vocals wouldn't really change the result here. And the year was 1987. Can you say \\"unbelievable\\"?<br /><br />This, ladies and gentlemen, is \\"Deathcrush\\", and if you want to dig deep to the roots of extreme music, this is more than mandatory.short and great thrashy beginning, noise begins (of course not the terrible kind of noise).

0060763280|5.0|I got a good chuckle out of reading the venomous rants below from our two deeply dissapointed get-rich-quickers. <br /> <br />These poor deluded lazy bones read a book like this, go to bed, and expect to wake up \\"stinking rich\\". However, when their bank balances are still the same the following morning, they become outraged and come back to Amazon to post extremely negative 1-star reviews. <br /> <br />These types of people never succeed at anything in life because they are oblivious to the fact that success in anything takes time, patience, and a lot of work.  <br /> <br />This is Harv's message. <br /> <br />Anyone reading this book honestly will see great repitition by Harv on these points about success:  action, self-discipline, total commitment, and hard work over a prolonged period of time. <br /> <br />I question whether anyone who has missed this has actually bothered to read the book.  <br /> <br />You don't get rich overnight by merely reading his or any other book. <br /> <br />If you are thinking of buying this book please read all of the reviews. You will notice that they come in two basic flavors: <br /> <br />1.

B0007O38F8|1.0|what can be said about 50 cent that hasn't already been said.  I'll try and give it a shot.  He used to be underground, which meant he took underground hip hop fans and totally played them like fools.  50 cent isn't hardcore, no matter which way you put it.  He tries to grab attention by doing outrageous stuff.  Nobody really thinks about gangster rap and gives it thought.  Now if 50 were really a gangster, he'd be dead.  Pure and simple.  He would not have lived nearly as long as has.  Lyrically speaking, I could wipe my ass with TP and put it in a cd player and it would sound better.  He can't freestyle ladies and gents, he can't.  I'm not fans of Nas, Jada, Fat Joe, or any of the other jabberwocky mainstream rappers out there.  They talk a lot of talk, but honestly, they can't do their job.  I don't know how they can live falsified lives by living by the code of the street, it got old quick.  As I said before, 50 cent can't freestyle.  G-Unit is also the same case.  Let's see them go against someone like Eyedea, Slug, Sage, Murs, Mr. Lif, etc.  They couldn't hold a candle to them.  The title of this review says 50 cent is rap, this means he's bad.  And you're also probably asking yourself why do I like Sage and Eyedea and such.  The answer is simply this... rap comes from the pocket, hip hop comes from the soul.   Peace.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The subject says it all.  I simply never get tired of this movie, and it *never* fails to elicit gut-busting laughter from me.  Easily the best comedy of the last 20 years, despite what the critics and box office have [wrongly] suggested. <br /> <br />The only other movie in my collection which holds a similar replay value and that even comes anywhere close to making me laugh this much is Blazing Saddles. <br /> <br />Oh yeah:  The soundtrack's killer, too, but that's pretty much to be expected from a Coen Brothers film.
1577312082|4.0|This book really drove the point home about living in the Now. I listened to the book on tape, and some of the things that the author said were difficult for me to understand, because I don't think I've heard them before. I wasn't familiar with alot of the terms he used. But the parts I did understand, I found very interesting.<br /><br />I think if you are new to these concepts you might have a hard time. But there is still plenty in the book that the beginner can understand and use.

B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|Nightwish are not newcomers to the metal scene, but they may be newcomers to the ears of the American people.  This is courtesy of Roadrunner records, who released the US version of Nightwish's fifth studio release, Once.  There are two bonus tracks that are present on this version.  (sorry, those of you who ordered the import version from Finland) One thing to note is that Nightwish recorded this album with a full symphony orchestra!  Lead singer Tarja once again gives a stunning performance on the vocals.  With the release of this album, Nightwish embarked on a full-scale US tour for the first time.  I did have the privelage to see them in Anaheim, CA, and they were amazing.<br /><br />The album starts out with a great intro, Dark Chest of Wonders.  This song has intense riffs, and the symphony is very present. Tarja's operatic vocals sound ethereal.  The chorus is very strong.  The next song is the single, Wish I had an Angel.  It took me a long time to like this song.  When they played it live, I didn't like it.  About a month after I bought the album, I decided to crank this song, and now I love it.  There is also a music video of this song, and it is very well done!  The third track is one of my favorites, Nemo.  This song is beautiful and the keyboards are brilliantly composed.  The two longest songs on the album are breathtaking songs.  Creek Mary's Blood, a song about Native Americans, and the song, Ghost Love Score, are the best on the album.  The symphony is at its best with Ghost Love Score, and it flows very well.<br /><br />Nightwish have written another solid album since the release of Century Child, which was also good.  Personally, I like this album a little better than Century Child, but in my opinion, Wishmaster is their best album.  The symphony was a very good addition to the recording of Once.  Whenever metal bands use symphonies it just adds another dimension to the music.  One of Finland's best bands continue to write very beautiful music and I would recommend fans that are new to Nightwish to check out the albums Oceanborn, and Wishmaster.  Nightwish are one of metal's most heavenly bands!nd fans that are new to Nightwish to check out the albums Oceanborn, and Wishmaster.  Nightwish are one of metal's most heavenly bands!
B0000057C5|5.0|Well I want to start by saying that this is one of my favourites albums ever. From the beginning 'til the end you'll love it. I present a review for each song next: <br /> <br />Sehnsucht 5/5: Personally this song is very special for me because is the first one I've learned. Besides that the song is really powerful. And it's a fan favorite. <br /> <br />Engel 5/5: It starts with a nice whistle, then the bass and then bum!!. A really interesting song and a really cool female voice that fits perfectly. <br /> <br />Tier 5/5: My Favorite. Excellent intro and excelent rythm, this an amazing song. The synth is really cool. <br /> <br />Bestrafe mich 5/5: This is a calmed song, but not for that stops being amazing. Two things: love the feeling in the lyrics and love the way it ends. <br /> <br />Du Hast 5/5: Along with Tier, this is my favourite too. Their most famous song and no doubt why, a really strong metal song. <br /> <br />Bck dich 4/5: Incredible song, a really catchy guitar and funny lyrics. <br /> <br />Spiel mit mir 5/5: Incest and more incest. This is the most dark song of the album but it's really wonderful. <br /> <br />Klavier 5/5: I can't believe the beautiness of the song, although it's a little bit sadic. <br /> <br />Alter Mann 4/5: Beautiful song with an incredible melody. <br /> <br />Eifersucht 5/5: HAHAHA!! jealousy is cooking. This song talks about that, Jealousy. It's actually a very interesting song with really cool effects. <br /> <br />Kss mich 5/5: WOW, this song it'a absolutely incredible, weird effects that confuse you. I consider this one as probably the best of the album. A really cool closure for an album. <br /> <br />If you buy this, you won't regret it. This album has everything.

B0002EXH4K|4.0|\\"Countdown to Extinction\\" is the source of much contention for Megadeth fans. Some view it as Megadeth selling out because of shorter and somewhat slower songs, as well as simpler riffs. Others see this as one of their best because it is much more accessible. No matter what your opinion is, this is definitely not a bad album.  \\"Skin O' My Teeth\\" starts off the album and gets the listener ready for their new (at least at the time) sound. It has a good solo, but the song is too short to be completely effective. \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" is somewhat overrated among fans. It doesn't really have an outstanding solo or riff or anything. That being said, this is not a bad song either, just a really good, straightforward metal song. The title track is powerful, with an excellent interlude. The two best songs on the album have to be \\"Foreclosure of a Dream\\" and \\"Ashes in Your Mouth.\\" The former is semi-melodic and the best (even though they only have done a few) ballad that Megadeth has ever done. It may seem dated at first because of the George Bush quote: \\"Read my Lips,\\" but it brings up a good point. Even though I am a huge supporter of George W. Bush, I can't help but think \\"Like father like son.\\" The second solo in the song is adrenaline pumping and nearly perfect. \\"Ashes in Your Mouth\\" is closer to \\"Rust in Peace\\" stuff because it is faster and over six minutes long. It contains four excellent solos and Dave's best vocal performance.  There have been many complaints over the years about the poor quality of Dave's voice, but somehow up until now he had made his sneer sound perfect with the music. Here, he sounds terrible. But then again I doubt most people listen to Megadeth for the vocals. My biggest criticism of this album (and what keeps it from five stars) are the two tracks \\"Captive Honour\\" and \\"Sweating Bullets.\\" They aren't really songs, because there isn't much singing, and Dave's voice is terrible. These two tracks are pointless and ruin an otherwise good album. Still, as bad as they are, they are only two tracks; the majority of the album is heavy, straightforward metal.  The remastering doesn't change the sound that much, and there's no real benefit of the bonus tracks either. So if you own the original version, don't feel the need to buy this. But if you do not own it, stop reading and order this right away.
B0002EXFNI|4.0|I have to admit to expecting something of the calibre of an \\"American Pie\\" style lewd comedy aimed squarely at the 16 - 24 demographic, but was more than pleasantly surprised to find otherwise. Whereas this movie does have definite parallels to \\"Risky Business\\" the former teen cult classic, it's actually a very well paced, acted and script built gentle comedy, that can and does stand on its own feet. Emile Hirsch plays the shy academic desperately seeking love or sex preferably at the end of his graduating year, and hangs around with two unintentionally comic, and likeminded \\"nerd\\" friends. Enter Elisha Cuthbert as the new next door neighbor, immediately making Hirsch smitten beyond thoughts of graduation, and his impending attempts to win a scholarship to an Ivy League College. This premise alone has potential but when you add that she is a former porn star trying to escape her past, and has a seductively villianous former Producer hanging around (played brilliantly by Tim Olyphant), the standard teen love tug formula gets a much needed makeover. There are plenty of laughs and original moments as the script twists and turns, and overall the effect is a \\"feelgood\\" movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't revert to formula nonsense either. Those expecting titillation may wish to check out the unrated version I suspect (not having seen it) as the bulk of the \\"sex\\" in this comedy is tastefully handled. It's refreshing to find a teen style comedy that although it might not dazzle the intellect, has a good solid story, and doesn't rely on sight gags, or cheap vulgarity. 4 stars is a little high, but this was mainly for Olyphants performance (who I last saw in Deadwood), who has a sinful panache that carries the bulk of the story (for me at least). Surprise ending may preclude repeat viewings for many, and DVD extra's are a little thin, otherwise very entertaining. Enjoy!

B000092ZYX|5.0|What can i say...this albums kicks ass.  We begin w/ 2+2=5, this track is just simply amazing, balls out rock and roll, the perfect guitar attack (thank god they're back :) ), a true radiohead classic--and its CRAZY during the later half-bit. \\"i try to sing along but...\\"  <br /> <br />Sit-down stand up is also great-- \\"walk in to the jaws of hell, anytime\\",-- it also gets crazy during the later half-- \\"and the rain drops, the rain drops\\" ---- with thom's voice nicely blended in w/ techno-esq majesty *chuckles* <br /> <br />Sail to the moon is beautiful.   <br /> <br />Backdrifters is not one of my fav's, but has some nice vocals... <br /> <br />Go to sleep is a classic radiohead track --\\"over my dead body\\"--cries thom...\\"we don't want the loonies takin' over\\" <br /> <br />Where i end and you begin, will surely send chills up your spine, ambient atmosphere, creepy vocals, (the guitar rhythm groove--part during the later half is fantastic, although it very short ~ 17 seconds)... <br /> <br />We suck young blood is a truly tortured track... <br /> <br />The gloaming takes a few listens, but i must admit it gets quite addictive after a while \\"they will suck down to the other side\\"... <br /> <br />There there--perfect, probably one of the best songs on this album (their first single for this album)... <br /> <br />I will--not one of my fav's, but i'll give it a few more listens... <br /> <br />A punch up at a wedding is not something you'd expect from a radiohead album, its very funky but i love it--\\"hypocrite, opportunist, don't infect me w/your poison\\"... <br /> <br />Myxomatosis--i love this one, its very very creepy.   <br />myxomatosis is actually a disease found in bunnies, but that has nothing to do w/this song.. <br />\\"It's about how people twist your words around to mean something different...then losing the exact meaning that you intended.

B0002OERI0|1.0|You may have seen these sheets like these on cooking shows or at fancy stores under the Silpat name selling for huge sums of money and were discouraged. Well, let me end any confusion and tell you that these work the same way! They are like having permanent non-stick surfaces for baking, roasting, and even candy making. You may be a bit scared to put this plastic looking sheet into the oven at first, but don't worry, as your pie would be charred before it would ever melt. <br /> <br />You may have been very frustrated by candy making in the past because the hot sugar would stick to anything that wasn't caked in non-stick spray. Fear no more, as this slippery wonder is a great working surface for kneading it while it's still hot or after it has cooled. If you want to keep it maleable for a longer period of time, set up a small heat lamp over the work surface. <br />
B0007P3582|2.0|It is a sad fact but although 50 is definately a better rapper than The Game his album isn't in the league of Game's. Nor is it close to his first album. Although there is some clever rhymes and flow on some tracks overall it is a mediocre album. Other than the singles we already know tracks worth hearing are Ski Mask Way, Piggybank, Ryder Music and Supposed to die Tonight. Only buy if you are a big 50 fan otherwise you can find something better to spend your Money on.
B0007O38F8|5.0|50 has done it again! Some of the tracks are wack but that doesn't mean that the whole album is!Disco Inferno,Candy Shop,Outta Control,and Piggy Bank are on Fire-go buy this CD now <br />Ya heard me! Fu*k all the Haters!GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG-G-Unit for Life!Holla

I did not hear anything at first, but then I actually listened to the songs, the words, the beats, the music in the background and now I can say I am enjoying the cd.  If you want quick hits that are going to be club songs or played on the radio sooner or later then listen to #'s 7,8,9,13,14, #18, & the remix for the game #22.  Overall, this cd is cool.You gotta really be where 50 is from to understand a great deal of his lyrical content.  Think about that then LISTEN to the cd. Peace.

Rated G. <br /> <br /> Disney has a lot to thank Pixar guru John Lassiter for, not only did Pixar extend its relationship with the once king of the animation universe by delaying the release of its final Disney CGI collaboration Cars until the profitable summer market in 2006 rather than rushing it out for the holiday season in 2005, but Lassiter was also the primary architect of the U.S. distributing deal Disney forged with Japan's premiere animation studio, Academy Award winning anime director Hayao Miyazaki's own Studio Ghibli. In the deal Disney obtained the U.S. distribution rights to all of Miyazaki's masterful films (save My Neighbor Totoro which was snatched up by Fox long before the current popular anime video movement in America) as well as the rights to the great studio's other properties; the first of which, Horiyuki Morita's 2002 film The Cat Returns, makes its DVD debut this month. <br /> Like the majority of Miyazaki's work, Morita's The Cat Returns does not play in the sword and sorcery/ sci-fi action of most anime popular in the U.S. video market, but tells an endearing and thoughtful coming of age story of a teenaged girl named Haru who is introduced to a hidden magical world due to an act of kindness she shows toward a cat.  Haru is a typical teenager who is having trouble coming to terms with the mounting responsibilities leading up to adulthood. She thinks everything in her life is against her. Such occurrences as missing her breakfast because she can't help hitting the snooze button on her alarm clock or the boy in which she is interested talking to another girl are life tragedies. Then, on the way home from school, she witnesses a cat crossing a busy stretch of road carrying a package wrapped with a ribbon. A truck speeds toward the unaware animal, undoubtedly about to end the creature's life, when Haru throws herself across the road, scooping up the endangered cat with her lacrosse stick. The stick breaks as the two crash into the shrubbery of the dividing median, another devastating blow to the teen's psyche. Then, to Haru's amazement, the cat stands upright on his hind legs like a human, brushes himself off, thanks her for her good deed with eloquent speech, places his package back in his mouth, and plods off around the corner back on all fours. <br /> This incident is merely the catalyst to a series of events that will teach Haru about real problems and how to deal with them with maturity, how even people of authority often lack maturity, and will introduce her to an entire universe that exists just beneath the attention span of human existence. Haru soon finds herself the object of the cat world's attention, as they shower her with gifts for the good deed she has done, for the cat she saved is the prince of their world. But while the cattails in her yard and catnip in her clothes may seem splendid to the cats, Haru finds these newfound attentions more of a burden than a boon. <br /> Soon she is visited by the Cat King himself to thank her for saving his son's life. The Cat King is an utterly unique character, sitting on his carriage as if he never bothers to move himself, with eyes that liken him to the bug-eyed character actor Marty Feldman, who enriched so many Mel Brooks films. Eventually it is revealed that the Cat King is just as crazy as he looks when Haru is kidnapped and brought to the Kingdom of Cats to become Prince Lune's bride. In an attempt to keep the captive Haru happy the Cat King marches a series of performers through the banquet hall to entertain the bride to be. As each performer fails to make the princess smile The Cat King has each one tossed out the window, which happens to be in one of the castle's highest towers. It was all I could do to stay in my seat fighting off the laughter as each cat performer's silhouette sailed out the tower window falling into oblivion. <br /> Before Haru is kidnapped she enlists the help of the Cat Bureau to help her stave off the Cat King's attempts to repay her. Muta is the fat cat who leads her to the Bureau's chief The Baron, who promptly orders Muta to become Haru's reluctant bodyguard. Muta treats all with the irreverence of a cat so large he has no need to show anyone or thing the respect he demands by his girth alone. The one thing in which he shows any interest beyond the blas is catnip juice, which in turn provides one of the film's most disturbingly humorous visuals. <br /> The visual style of the piece is not as ornate as Miyazaki's films, however still proves Studio Ghibli's reputation as one of the best animation houses in Japan and the world. There is striking depth to some of the sequences that are given a mock third dimensional treatment, such as the scene where Haru originally saves Prince Lune from the speeding truck or when the Kingdom of Cats is first revealed to Haru and Muta. And only in Japanese anime can you find such imagination that utilizes objects and animals from the real world to create breathtaking images and ideas, like the swirling bird staircase that plays a part in the resolution of Haru's fate. <br /> The Cat Returns captures much of the youthful innocence and heartening sentiment of Miyazaki's wonderful Kiki's Delivery Service and throws in just a taste of the hidden mystery and eccentric characterization of his Academy Award winning Spirited Away. While here it is presented ona lesser scale than in those Miyazaki classics, The Cat Returns still outshines anything in the form of family entertainment produced by Disney or any other animation studio the U.S. has to offer, save maybe Pixar. And with Disney quickly abandoning its traditional animation style to compete with whomever ends up distributing Pixar after their relationship with that award winning studio is severed, Studio Ghibli may be traditional animation's sole savior, at least in the family market.
0440237688|4.0|I am a 30's something female just starting to read Lois Lowry again.  This book gripped me and I could not put it down.  It is so far fetched from society that I wanted to know what happened next.  It is a neat story and I really enjoyed it.  I did not like the way it ended, but you need to read her other book The Messenger when you are done.
B000003TAB|5.0|In the course of their careers Nirvana was able to accomplish many amazing things. They literally changed the face (and dress code) of the music industry when Nevermind dropped. After that the name Nirvana was on the lips of everyone with ears. However, well over a decade since the original bang Nirvana lives on through the new box set \\"with the lights out\\" and the countless singles you can hear on the radio. Mostly cuts off of Nevermind. It is with all of this in mind that I must say, what about Incesticide. This is the only album of its kind that Nirvana made. Bleach was dark and almost metal in some instances. Nevermind was polished punk that turned into a \\"grungy\\" form of pop. For In utero Kurt was so upset that he lost the punk sound that he experimented throughout the album. But with all of this. Incesticide is the ROCK album.  This album, with the exeption of Nevermind is probably the most accessible by common fans and radio alike, yet often overlooked. Every track , except for Mexican seafood, is an example of straight ahead rock n' roll. Power chords abundant, and with gain you can thrash too, I am a firm believer that this is the best album Nirvana made. Yes it is that good. Dive, Sliver, Molly's Lips and my god Aneursym! All of these are amazing songs that the common fan no nothing of. And to me that is just sad. I think this is Nirvana before the legacy, when Kurt was happy. Before his life got torn into shambles and the drugs got the better of him. I must say one thing, if you own any Nirvana album, or like any song besides Smells like teen spirit, you need to go out and buy this.
0553802534|4.0|The character development of Bobby is excellent, and the storyline was pretty good.  However, I felt the last 50 pages or so were a bit rushed.  Perhaps because I've come to expect some level of romance in Lisa Gardner's books I was kind of disappointed that this book was missing that component.  However, the story was good, and the characters were complex and compelling, and I hope that Bobby shows up in another book.   Overall it's a good read, but if you like a little romance with your mystery this book isn't for you.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I am a Tool fan. Already you may think \\"Then why the hell was he listening to Mars Volta???\\". Well Tool is different. And I like music that is different. Music that stimulates your imagination. Music that touches you on an emotional level. Music that makes you think. Tool makes that kind of music. A friend gave me \\"Deloused...\\" and told me to listen to it. At the first pop in I turned it off. I thought they were some kind of lame punk band. After a while it began to grow on me. Their lyrics are so intense and emotional, The lead singer has a GREAT voice, and the music is unbelievably creative and deep. This is an awesome album. You may not like it at first but I guarantee it will grow on you as it did with me. I can't go a day without listening to Tool. Now Mars Volta is in my every day playlist.
B00005JMUA|4.0|It took me a while to see Vol. 2, but it was well worth the wait.  I didn't like it as much as the first one - which I thought was great - with a lot of action as well as storyline.  There's a lot more story in Vol. 2 and a lot LESS action.  Anyway, it was an excellent sequel.  If you've seen 1, then you have to see 2.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|I started it 15 minutes ago and it contains an *unskippable* preview section at the front. Don't buy DVDs like this. At this point, I'm sure the movie wont be good enough to merit the pain of watching these terrible previews.

B000002UAF|5.0|Or something like that. Um... nevermind.<br /><br />And here it is - the very first (and only) album comprised of *all* Lennon & McCartney material, and what an excellent album it is. The Beatles' third album, overall, the boys had already started out with some mightily impressive songwriting skills, chops, and infectious melodies with their first two albums, _Please Please Me_ and _With The Beatles_ (both from 1963.) However, unlike those two (which feature a mix of originals and covers), this album is comprised of *all* original material, and the songwriting is also a step up, overall, from their first two albums.<br /><br />Something that seems to fly over the heads of many Beatles fans is the complexity involved in the majority of their music. Yes, their later material was not the only music to be complex. In fact, this aspect started from the beginning, actually, and this album is no exception: many of the chords, progressions and structures to the songs on this album are very advanced -- especially coming from a rock band who wrote their own material back in the early '60s, and what's a hell of a lot more impressive is how they seem to make it all sound so seemingly simple; the complexity of the musicianship doesn't overwhelm the music, but in actuality, it plays an important role in making their music as infectious and devouring as it was (and still is): the way they treat the melodies, and how they sequence and arrange them are so marvelous.<br /><br />You know the title track, as it features that explosive, shot-in-the-dark strum of a chord (which is complex, by the way.) And from there, we are taken on an exciting ride. We get infectious rockers like the aforementioned title track, lovely, melodic-soaked ballads like \\"If I Fell,\\" more infectious rockers like \\"Happy Just To Dance With You,\\" which is sung by George Harrison, and features some stunning arrangements, but these arrangements make for some interesting, mysterious, yet infectious melodies, which lend the track a certain sexy, elegant and utterly classy quality. We also get Latin-infused numbers like Paul McCartney's \\"And I Love Her.\\"<br /><br />My favorite track on this excellent album is \\"Tell Me Why.\\" Many people on this page seem to bash this track, which is fine. It was rumored that John Lennon himself didn't think the world of this track, and said that it was a song written without much effort, and that it was inspired by his love of the R&B \\"girl groups\\" from that time period. You can definitely hear the influence here (and in certain other Beatles songs), but the passionate, raucous, uninhibited, and alternately beautiful vocal harmonies, the sexy way in which they swing, and the jazzy basslines from McCartney are just a few of the things that contribute to the creation of something which is almost orgasmic to my ears.<br /><br />Later, we get to see one of the earliest examples of The Beatles exploring their love of country-rockabilly in \\"I'll Cry Instead,\\" while \\"Things We Said Today\\" is more of a melancholic-toned melody, which, ironically, features a fairly-fast tempo. \\"You Can't Do That\\" features some ominous lyrics to a lover, but yet the melody and the song in general sounds so up-tempo, jovial and celebratory. And, to close off the album, we have \\"I'll Be Back,\\" one of the most understatedly beautiful songs on the album.<br /><br />The Beatles didn't ever really put out an album that wasn't filled to the brim with infectiousness, and impressive musicianship. This 1964 juggernaut is no exception. Highly recommended.hich lend the track a certain sexy, elegant and utterly classy quality.

B00006EXL5|5.0|This album is the best album that ever existed. Having bought Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, I felt there could be no album exceeding such excellence. I was surfing amozon for other My Chemical Romance albums and I came across I brought you my bullets you brought me your love. The best choice I have ever made. It has had such an influence on my life as a guitarist. I strongly reccommend any Emo fans to by this album. It will blow you away
B00000273M|5.0|The Bangles were great, and highly influential. <br /> <br />When they broke up, the music industry lost a great talent. <br /> <br />that is sad, but it is happy that their music lives on. <br /> <br />
0670033375|3.0|I've always been fascinated by ghost towns, civilizations that have disappeared and ways of life that have vanished.  Naturally, Collapsed appealed to that part of my interests.  I was pleased to find convenient summaries of the latest research on what happened to Easter Island, the Norse on Greenland, the Mayas, and many other interesting cultures around the world that failed to survive until today.  A pleasant bonus in the book was to find out about many cutting edge scientific methods used to sort out what happened and when in past civilizations.<br /><br />Collapse also looks at some of the current problem areas of the world using the lens of what went wrong in earlier societies.  The materials on Australia and Rwanda were particularly well done and added to my knowledge of those countries.<br /><br />If the book had stopped there, I would have graded it as a five star effort.<br /><br />The book continued, however, and falls into mediocrity when it starts to look at today's world and what needs to be done.  The only strong section within this part of the book came in the discussion of efforts by large companies to make \\"good citizenship\\" profitable by both avoiding more costly remediation later and being more attractive to customers in the meantime.<br /><br />The rest of the book is an oversimplified argument that extrapolates trends in areas that harmed former civilizations (like deforestation) into presenting a dire threat for our collective future today.  To make that argument stick, you have to look deeply at the countertrends that can offset the potential harm from the trends.  Collapse briefly acknowledges some of those trends, but doesn't get below the surface.<br /><br />My own reaction to the book is that in today's increasingly specialized, global economy (remember Adam Smith in his book, The Wealth of Nations?) each country will do fewer things for itself and rely more on its fellow humans who can do other things better.  Many of the contemporary issues raised in this book can be seen in that light rather than as civilization threatening.  I don't know which view is correct (or if both are), but Collapse doesn't really add much to the argument for either side.temporary issues raised in this book can be seen in that light rather than as civilization threatening.

B0006399FS|3.0|Let's face it, most lifelong U2 fans are going to like How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.  Cuz you know you're chewin' bubble gum, you know what it is, but you still want some, you just can't get enough of that luvie duvie stuff...   <br /> <br />The lines from Discotheque, for me, sum up U2's current hit \\"Vertigo\\".  I am a lifelong U2 fan, and I cannot help but eat it up like a piece of candy bubble gum.  How is \\"Vertigo\\" any different than \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" or \\"Zoo Station\\"?  I like all these songs.  I do wish they would have come up with a better title, though. <br /> <br />Leave the title and \\"Vertigo\\" behind, and the rest of the album is a satisfying journey similiar in tone to The Unforgettable Fire.   <br /> <br />\\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is maddening guitar by the Edge.  The guitar is hard to trace back to other Edge riffs. It's fresh, and new, probably due to his dislike of Bono politics. <br /> <br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" plays like \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" but with a dark, nightlife kind of joy.   <br /> <br />\\"Man and a Woman\\" is ok.  My own interpretation is the band was trying in vain to copy a middle-age version of those long-winded loungy tunes \\"Surrender\\" and \\"Red Light\\" off of War.  Bono is lousy, but the music is good. <br /> <br />\\"One Step Closer\\" is a great song!  The song is about growing older, facing death, and can be interpreted as facing judgment if you believe in a higher being.  It plays like \\"The First Time\\" from Zooropa, but is ten times better because the lyrics flow more logically than \\"The First Time\\". <br /> <br />On the whole, this album is entirely different than All That You Can't Leave Behind.  ATYCLB was very much a self-help, uplifting, Oprah-approved album, with plenty of candy. Teenagers loved the songs and the Elevation Tour.  HTDAAB is not as politically correct, and calls for community; most of the songs have lines that reflect the influence of a christian lifestyle, tolerance, and justice, but the album also emits frustration and cynicism.  We need a \\"Mircle Drug\\"!  And, just like the end of Achtung Baby, HTDAAB has solid songs with serious topics that are very satisfying.  Unfortunately, the lyrics and music material are not overwhelmingly new to most U2 fans.  U2 has lost some steam, but I still anticipate their music, and I can't wait for the next album.   <br />
B0007GAEW6|2.0|As an a long time, avid fan of ATDI, I still think Omar and company were better with their Sparta counterparts, as At The Drive-In.  Compared to Mars Volta's, Tremulent EP, and their De-loused LP, Francis the Mute seems to be more about long periods-and I mean long periods-of miscellaneous noise.  I'm sure that when they were recording this album, they knew what all the strangeness was about, but they failed to get any meaning across to the listener.  Like De-loused, the music-when there was music-was solid and really good.  There was alot of layering and more Espaniol lyrics, which was nice.  I liked those parts, and wished there were more like them.  I just think, on this release, Mars Volta was trying way too hard to be \\"out there,\\" and didn't concentrate enough on the music itself.  I have to say that I'm truly disappointed in Francis.  I was really looking forward to it, also.  So, if you're wondering if you should rush out and by this album-I say borrow it from someone or burn it.  Don't waste your time and your money, unless you're just a die hard who has to own the cd, regardless of its sound.  Maybe Mars Volta will do it better next time around...
B000089RVX|3.0|Evanescence is one of the greatest things to ever happen to MTV. Compared to all the artists on that channel, their songs are orignal, their lyrics thought-provoking, their atmosphere emotional. Now, compared to other less mainstream bands, like Nightwish, Tristania, and Lacuna Coil, their songs, lyrics, and atmosphere are simplistic and cliche. <br /> <br />When I first started listening to Evanescence, I had just grown out of my boy band pop-music phase a couple years ago, and was going through a stage where I didn't listen to much music at all. Then I heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on the Rock Countdown, and I was floored. I bought their CD, which was the first CD I purchased in a long time, and instantly fell in love with all the songs. It made me interested in the dark side of music, which eventually led me to discover bands like the ones I mentioned earlier, and true goth bands like Switchblade Symphony, Sisters of Mercy, Skinny Puppy, Collide, etc. After introducing myself to these underground artists, Evanescence owned up to the meaning of their name: They faded into the background, vanishing away to almost nothing. I discovered their music was really nothing special. <br /> <br />Most of the people reviewing this album, whether they said it was good or crap, probably never laid eyes on a copy of their out-of-print album Origin, or their also OOP EPs. I was fortunate enough to have a friend with a copy of these burn them for me. Over all, I think a lot of the material on their OOP work is much better, a lot more original, but they don't have as good production as Fallen has. <br /> <br />So overall, I believe Evanescence is still a good band, but unfortunately a band who fell into the money-hungry trap of a major record label. If you're a person who watches MTV compulsively and listens to the likes of Ashlee Simpson or Britney Spears, I suggest you buy this album. You will love it because the songs are catchy, and also have a deep and emotional quality that othermainstream artists lack. If you already hate MTV and everything popular, you WILL hate this album(unless you're open-minded). Evanescence is the purgatory between the major, fake music industries and the underground artists who compose music to compose music, not for the money.
0786890754|5.0|I read this book within the span of about 2 days.  It is touching and one minute had me crying my eyes out and the next laughing hysterically (only one other thing has made me do that and that was the first time I saw \\"Steel Magnolias\\" years and years ago with the scene in the cemetary where one minute Sally Field has hysterically crying and the next she is laughing hysterically ... I was doing the same thing then and now). <br /> <br />It is a great book and having seen what my mother went through when my father died and one a friend of mine went through when her husband died when she was 34, I have to say Cecelia Ahern pretty much got it right, which is amazing considering she was 21 years old when she wrote this book. <br /> <br />The only thing I wish were different is that Holly & Daniel had ended up together in the book. <br /> <br />I read that Warner Brothers had bought the film rights to this and I will be looking forward to seeing the movie! <br /> <br />This is a great book and I highly recommend it!!
B00004U8P9|4.0|Monday, March 07, 2005 / 4 of 5 / The classic gender bending sci-fi/horror/musical<br />It's true, repeated viewings do help to make some sense of this sexually twisted little musical.  To this day there's something sinister, awkward, and vaguely repulsive about seeing Tim Curry in drag as Dr. Frank.  Brad and Janet, Republican squares, end up at the castle home of the afore mentioned doctor on the night he breaths life into his male blonde Adonis creation, Rocky.  Gender bending and partner swapping ensue throughout the night as Brad and Janet endure sexual awakenings neither planned on nor felt they wanted.  The rest of the denizens of the castle complete the cast, especially the erstwhile sibling help, Magenta and Riff Raff.  Meatloaf entertains as Eddy, the psychotic Elvis inspired biker.  Frank N. Furter's bisexual / transvestite antics could be off putting, even grossly unappealing; but over all the film hits a key with certain societal elements and isn't too bad to take in otherwise.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|While some critics dismiss \\"The Karate Kid\\" as a 1980s teen movie, I place it in the same category as such classics as \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Rocky\\" and \\"Jaws.\\"  It is a beautifully-written, -acted and -directed film that pulls at your heartstrings and makes you cheer.  Pat Morita's Mr Miyagi (for which he received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor) is one the archetypal characters in American film.  His relationship with Ralph Maccio's Daniel LaRusso is as genuine and touching as any you will find in film.  I remember seeing it in the theater when I was very young and the audience exploding into applause at the final \\"crane kick\\" scene.  That does not happen very often. <br /> <br />The DVD of the entire series is now available (Part 2 is decent but Parts 3 and 4 are not).  The best DVD feature is the making-of documentary.  It's been 21-years since this film was in theaters and all the major contributors are still alive and in good spirits for the documentary.  Everyone involved in the project sees this movie as the pinnacle of their careers (and I agree with them).  <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite films.  I give it my highest recommendation. <br /> <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|Not much else I can say about this CD that hasn't already been said. There are some decent beats on this album and that's why I gave it 1 star. 50 Cent is a bad rapper (and even those that enjoy this album should agree). He has nothing new to offer.  Listen to his song with Eminem to see the huge gap in talent.  I highly recommend that you spend your $ somewhere else. This CD will get old really quick.
B00002EPJH|5.0|I was one of those Keith Jarrett fans who criticized this album, simply because I didn't feel the Keith I knew there: music is plain and lackluster. I considered this album as a rip-off from ECM. I thought I know Keith well enough to say that. But I was wrong. I knew him well as a musician, but not a person.<br /><br />As Keith said, music come not just from music. Music is the result of a process, by a person. You really have to understand Keith as a person, rather than a musician, to understand this album. Most of you know Keith suffered from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome during the time of the recording of this album, but not all of you may have a chance yet to watch on BBC channel 4, Mike Dibb's documentary, the Art of Improvisation, about Keith. Here's what Keith said on the Melody At Night, With You (with My Wild Irish Rose):<br /><br />\\"...in December of 1997, I may have recorded The Melody At Night, With You. But that is a monumental effort for a Christmas present. And just, I couldn't leave the house; I didn't know what to get to Rose Anne.\\"<br /><br />\\"Rose Anne: And, that Christmas day, we each give each other these little boxes. My gift was in this little tiny box, and his was just a couple of DATs wrapped so it was about that big with a little bow on it. I was astounded.\\"<br /><br />\\"I was telling the disease, I know you are here, I have accepted your presence, and I am still going ahead with this work. But to start the work, I am going to make it as personal as possible.\\"<br /><br />\\"Rose Anne: I just broke down in tears, because it was... too much, too romantic, and too sweet. And the fact that he was out there, you know, playing just as much as he could, which was just a minute or two at the time, and that will be like, touched me.\\"<br /><br />\\"It wasn't intended to release, but it was the first playing I have done. And everytime I got complex, I stop. I wanted to stay about the song, about the singing of the song. So I was transforming my disease into a song.\\"<br /><br />Forget those who depicts how beautiful (or dull) this album is; this album means more than that. Manfred is a very sensitive man, a good listener to a musician. He must have been moved. I guess the release of this album might had been a persistent effort from him rather than the willingness of the artist.<br /><br />As music lovers, sometimes it's something other than music that has driven us to love music so much.

As music lovers, sometimes it's something other than music that has driven us to love music so much. Music is more than just music in the way love is more than words can say.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Not much else I can say about this CD that hasn't already been said.  There are some decent beats on this album and that's why I gave it 1 star.  50 Cent is a bad rapper (and even those that enjoy this album should agree).  He has nothing new to offer and the ONLY reason he became such a huge hit is because of the help Eminem & Dr.Dre gave him.  I highly recommend that you spend your $ somewhere else.  This CD will get old really quick.
B0002X314C|3.0|Solid album but it woould be better if John Legend could sing better. His voice is not very good
B0007P3582|1.0|50 Cent is absolute garbage and this album will probably be the most hyped up piece of fetid trash to come out of hip hop this year.   <br /> <br />He is at best a mediocre rapper lucky enough to be connected to Dre and eminem. Disco Inferno is tepid garbage.  He is calculating enough to know that the brain dead white teenagers in America  will buy anything that supposedly sports a \\"hot\\" beat but any true fan of hip hop will recognize that he is utterly devoid of any inspiration.   He has nothing positive to say, just the same old tired cliches we have heard a billion times before.   <br /> <br />The fact that he has the audacity to diss Nas, who could rap circles around him is stunning.  He never abandons the single syllable rhyming structure while Nas is one of the most athletic rhymers on the planet.   <br /> <br />Of course Rolling Stone and other lame ass publications will promote this but that doesn't mean it is any good.  Save your money.
B0007O38F8|4.0|obviously everyone who wrote a bad review is either an idiot, from new york, or a fag rule fan...hahahah <br />or maybe mr. ja himself din have nuttin else to do cept go online and write bad reviews for his enemies...hahahaa <br />punk ass *&@%$ ahahah <br />aite now for the review...this album is pretty hot...not as good as get rich or die tryin but it's still blazin...hahah <br />well u should buy dis cd...my fav song in dis album \\" if i can't\\"
B0002X314C|5.0|this is a great cd, dont get me wrong. but his live cd at the knitting factory is amazing with beautiful renditions of \\"refuge\\", \\"so high\\", \\"she dont have to know\\", \\"lifted\\", and a version of \\"stay with you\\" that youll find very hard not to listen to all the time. anyways, get lifted is also a definite purchase with the perfect mix of slow and upbeat, with excellent track layout too. <br /> <br />irregardless, if your a fan of good R&B, you need to get this CD!!!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|For a band that never changes, never grows... Who basically puts out the same record over and OVER, look elsewhere. <br /> <br />When I first heard Frances, I admit I was a little shocked, and not necessarily in a good way... I didn't know what to make of their newest 'sound' and found myself a little confused. <br />But the second time I listened to it, I had an epiphany: <br />This band is amazing. This band is truly innovative.They EASILY could have taken easy street and put out another De-loused, just with different music and different concepts and words and most likely no one would have minded too much.But they DIDN'T. They opted to NOT box themselves into one particular sound; they opted to make themselves known as a band that is about , go figure, experimenting. <br />Imagine that!!! Experimental music that actually experiments!!! HOW cool is that??? <br /> <br />The mars-effing-Volta is a force in music to be reckoned with. Someone who wrote a review down there said that this album is like a train: you can only either hop on and have a wild latin-outerspace ride or just let it mow you over... and, well... that is quite accurate. <br /> <br />People ask me which album I like more... well, admittedly, <br />I do like De-loused more.... but it's hard to say if that is because of the actual music or if because when De-loused came out, it was like... nothing short of REVOLUTIONARY to me; the world had only heard a glimpse of TMV in Tremulant (for those who actually did hear it) and I was just waiting for the world to see what I saw in them when I first bought Tremulant. <br /> <br />Regardless, I still give Frances a five because TMV is truly, literally, thee most innovative band that has ever existed since maybe Amon duul II or something... <br />For us true psychedelic fans, TMV is nothing short of life changing. <br /> <br />A innovative band that's not afraid to (god forbid) branch out and STAY innovative.. a band that's not afraid to shake even their fans upa little. <br />A-fookin'-PLUS.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Not a good cd, this guy is not a good rapper, he has a few hit songs from this cd that will be forgotten by the summer.  Download the hot songs and forget about the rest.  He talked about ja rule so much and then this guy comes back just like he wants to be ja rule.  This guy talks S*** on a bunch of rappers that are much better than he is trying to stir controversy to get some album sales.  dont buy this go buy Jadakiss, The Game, Shyne, Nas,Fat Joes, or even Ja Rules cd they were all better than this garbage.      ~~~~~ LOOK OUT THIS SUMMER FOR ```THE DEBUT ALBUM BY ~~~~CHAMILLIONAIRE~~~~\\"THE SOUND OF REVENGE\\"   ITS GONNA BE THE HOTTEST CD OF THE YEAR.      CHAMILLITARY MAN
0767802519|5.0|Unlike most reviewers, I greatly prefer the shorter 110 minute version of this masterpiece.  I only recently disappointed myself with the longer DVD version and will not be watching _that_ again!<br /><br />Get the shorter film and enjoy a much higher level of tension, while skipping scenes that are very much worth omitting.  At a minimum they should offer both versions of the movie on DVD, with a simple choice presented to the viewer -- like the Terminator 2 Extreme Edition DVD does.<br /><br />People who loved the original need to be warned about the longer version, and now I've done that.<br /><br />Enjoy.
0394720288|5.0|After every two sentences or so, I had to put this book down and howl like a hyena.  This was my first Bertie and Jeeves book and I think it's a comic masterpiece.  In Code of the Woosters, the plot spins faster and faster until the immensely satisfying end, where everyone gets what he or she deserves.<br /><br />Wodehouse's comedy has no mean side to it - his writing remains engaging without resorting to the snideness that many humor writers employ.  I still can't figure out how Wodehouse keeps my attention and keeps me laughing when his general theme is the unwavering silliness of the English twit.  I'm heading to the bookstore for more.
B000065U1N|5.0|Ridley Scott, the creator of \\"The Duellists\\", the \\"Gladiator\\" and other masterpieces of cinematographic violence, really made a fantastic job with the unlucky US raid in Moghadishu on October 3, 1993. The film follows the real action with much clarity and presents the real protagonists in an unforgettable way. The accidents, the shootdown of the two helicopters, the anxiety of finding oneshelf fighting surrounded among throngs of frenzied Somali warriors and the terrific, deadly and mutilating effect of the various modern infantry weapons are presented with such realism that the viewer holds his/her breadth. Highly recommended for all those interested in modern combat and the many unpredicted twists that fate can take during a battle.
B0002IU988|4.0|I hated Creed for producing one of the worst vocal styles in the industry. Alter Bridge is a fix for a problem that everyone knew existed.  <br />The band is tight and Tremonti makes the best of his unique talent while never stepping on the clean vocals of Kennedy. His clear voice shines like a beacon against the gutteral grunters and rap-metal bands dominating what people allow to pass as metal now. Alter Bridge has a perfectly appropriate name as they are a bridge between what sells and what inspires.  <br />Kennedy has a range and clarity that reminds me at times of the incredible voice of Daniel Gildenlow from Pain of Salvation.  <br />Alter Bridge will hopefully provide enough of an influence in the mainstream market to direct a few more bands in the direction of creating something built on meaning and passion rather than just aggression and trends.

B0007GADZO|5.0|If you're reading this it's not because you were looking for Green Day and fell into this somehow. You're here because you know Vai and you either have it and want to see what the rest of us think, or you soon will.  <br />This album seems, to me, as much a tribute to his past as it is an assurance of his continual progression.  <br />I hear little influences and tinges of Flex-Able, Passion and Warfare and all the rest. They're like nice little shoulder chucks from a friend you know you'll be hanging out with for years to come.  <br />But in the end this is a brand new Vai album and it just feels like it should. Each one he does bears a deeper emotional sensitivity and Reflections displays that growing emotion wonderfully.
B0007O38F8|1.0|What is the deal with this 50 cent fella? <br />he's lyrics and ability to rap is pathetic he's voice shows no emotion or range and he's vocab just lacks depth it's only a matter of time before a person becomes bored of hearing the stuttering phrase G-Unit what's the guys obsession with guns aswell? can't he sell a album without resorting to constant bickering of oh im a pimp ive got big guns my sons  <br />People who compare this guy to Tupac seriously need to take a closer look at 50 cent he is a over hyped fool  <br />I could produce a better track than this chump least I would be considered orignal and not commericial  <br />As this new album goes we have heard it all before and face it it has already been done better before :) <br />if these guys are the future of rap then jesus what's it coming to i agree with the Game and also agree that he would be better off away from 50 because at the end of the day the game has tighter flows than 50 cent and is a better lyricist and poor old 50 doesn't want the game to out shine him <br />well i'm sorry son but hey already has  <br />this album is whack <br />your a commerical pop rap making pathetic excuse of a rapper <br />I would challenge you anytime on the mic and would embarrass you <br />peace out <br />dont bother releasing a 3rd album this is the end of you  <br />You are the whackest of the whackest rappers get some new material tupac did it better :) plus he kept it real   <br />
B0007O38F8|4.0|All these bad reviews are written by jadakiss' fan club. this isnt as good as GRODT but most sphmore albums suck anyways. dre hits on a few beats and ski mask way and ryder music are cool,12 of these songs are pretty good. so 10 filler pretty much , i think this is an ok album. but if ur a G_Unit Hater than stay way from this
B0006284JQ|1.0|Give me a reason why you should buy this cd. Please, if you are a whiny 13 year-old who owns every other album she's produced, then you've heard'em all. The only new song is a cover from a very good song.... thanks to Britney, that status no longer valid. Her singing is aweful, if you think she sang a difficult passage masterfully, you can blame technology for permitting that. If Britney didn't happen to be one of the most beautiful creatures alive, she would be bankrupt. Then again, sex sells, and that is why people continue to buy material from this hoax. <br />Seriously, I try to avoid listening to her on the radio as much as possible, and I don't care if she publishes cd's, but a GREATEST HITS record.... give me a break. That is ridiculous. Bands like The Beatles deserve Greatest Hits albums, not Britney Spears. Guys buy this because she is a godess, and girls buy it be she is a role model to them, I can't explain how. But then again, most of them grow up with Britney and then forget her. It is a phase most teenagers go through, most of the time. I bet you you can finger-count the fans that have been with her since the beggining and continue to be. And to those who believe Britney Spears is the best singer in the world, God bless you and your little ignorant brain, because no one else will. Don't buy this album, she just published this album simply to make millions from songs that already gave her millions. That is the reality, and I hope never to see another publication from her again in my life. It shortens my ears life-span.
B000002B1M|5.0|Man, when Nas came out with Illmatic, it gave hip hop heads hope that pure hip hop would live forever.  Once It Was Written came out, there was  a lot of expectations.  Now even though this didn't come quite as good as Illmatic, this one is still in classic status.  One thing that definitely was better was the fact he had more tracts on this than Illmatic.  It starts off great.  You have the Message, probably the 2nd best track on this  album.  The beat is just nice.  You have street dreams which is the 3rd best.  (On that note, it seems that Nas can do justice on beats from other artist, from this which is also Tupac's All Eyes on Me, to Papa Was a Playa which was a sample of College Boyz victim of a ghetto.) That was beside the fact.  Anyways, the beat just was perfect for Nas Street Dreams lyrics.  Then I gave you power which was the best track on here.  It has the same loop running through the whole song, but it works perfect.  Great beat, great lyrics, as he is rhyming about a guns point of view.  If I ruled the world, man Lauryn Hill voice was just nice over the chorus, and Nas made us all wish we ruled the world after he was done with his three versus.  My only complaint, was not Dr. Dre being in it, because even though he's kinda sold out and done weird things with his career, but man I respect him for doing all that he did in the late 80's with NWA and early 90's with Snoop and gang, but it's Foxy Brown in Affirmative Action.  I can't stand her, and I wish she didn't have the longest verse out of AZ and Nas and her.  Nas and AZ could have done it alone, kept Foxy out of the Firm, and that would have been sick.  But nothings perfect, and Foxy makes this from absolutely perfect.  This was the last good work Nas put out until the remixes on Illmatics 10th Anniversary, and the Lost Tapes work, which actually was a bunch of songs made between the wack I Am and the even more wack Nastrodamus.  Get this, this was Nas before he fell off for the next five years.  This is what hip hop is supposed to be.   One last note, why are there people dissing Pac?  I mean, yeah these two had beef, but they quashed it before Pac died RIP.  I won't start reviewing Pac, but quit hatin on him.  He was a great lyricist. Anyways, I'm out.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|To start out, i have only listened to one of Nightwishs cd's. That would be Oceanborn. That is pretty good. Since i heard that cd i have been a Nightwish addict. I just had to get there latest album, Once.  <br /> <br />Within 10 min of arriving at my house i put the cd in the computer, ripped it, and put it on my mp3 player..and i havent been able to stop listening to it since.( about 3 or 4 days now) It is that good. The song structures are breathtaking. MY favorites so far are all of them. Every single song on Once is like listening to a different cd.This cd is going to be one of my all time favorite's.  <br /> <br />I recommend getting this cd if you are a Evanescence fan. Nightwish is like evanescence...except with a lot more energy.
B0007NFL18|1.0|This album is garbage.  I honestly can't believe how he could go from a cd that was an instant classic to this crap he unveiled on everybody.  I got a bootleg of this cd about 3 weeks before the cd came out and I must say I tried to listen to it over and over again, but it's just horrible.  I would maybe say there are about 5 good songs on the entire album, and 2 of which are already on the radio.  You're better off downloading the better songs because I thank GOD that I didn't waste my money on this trash.  This album will sell a million plus in the first week and definitely won't have the staying power of \\"Get Rich\\"..  I believe the only people who will really like this are die hard fans of 50 cent, and I do mean like they must worship him die hard.   <br />Then this crazy a$$ had to come at Nas.  I was never big into Nas, but I just generally liked his music, and Nas may not sell as many records as 50 cent, but I'll guarantee you that if he can make a Rap giant like Jay-Z look unequal with two lines \\"Eminem murdered you on your own sh*t, you a d*ck riding fagg*t..you love the attention..Queens n*iggaz run you n*ggaz, ask Russell Simmons\\" Or \\"Put it together..I rock ho*s ya'll Roc-fellas\\"...on the diss track \\"Ether\\"..I can only imagine what he's going to do to 50 cent.  Because 50 Cent really shows his talent on this cd...He can't rap.  If he were on some other label like Def Jam or Universal or something he never would've been a superstar like he is now.  2 years ago I would've never believed that because I thought Get rich or die trying was the best Rap cd since All Eyes on Me.  So many people said 50 was garbage, and now I finally believe it.  And back to the diss track, yeah he may work Fat Joe, but Jada can rhyme too, and will murder 50 as well.  The hottest diss track 50 Cent has is \\"Hail Mary\\", and he basically just rearranged the verses from Tupac's version and Tupac's Against All Odds, and plus he was talking about Ja Rule, who was crap from the beginning.  I believe he just stepped into some hot water and when Nas and Jada retaliate, he's going to drown....DO NOT BUY THIS...If you want to try it out..Download it, steal it, burn it from a friend something..because I wouldn't pay 50 CENT for this Sh*t.
B000067G3C|5.0|I can't much improve on A. Ross of New Zealand's review.  I enjoyed Speed when it first came out on VHS (remember that?) because it was a different type of movie at the time.  It was, and still is, refreshing to watch because it offers something different.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper's character was the unofficial star of the film, his deed was the film's plot, but he had the least amount of screen time.  When he did make an appearance you paid attention, wondering what this psychopath (\\"...with fingers numbering 9\\") was going to do next.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock had great on-screen chemistry (which I understand they're trying to duplicate in another movie).  Dennis Hopper played his part so well that you just wanted to put him through a wall for being one step ahead of the good guys.<br /><br />Speed may well be \\"one extended action scene\\" but it was a refreshingly different premise and it's one that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
B00005176F|5.0|It's so strange to me, but even before I knew who Damon Albarn was, his music made me smile.  I understand that there are others in the band, but it's mainly him who I find so intregueing.  The Gorillaz were an instant snap for me, as was Blur.  This album is genuinley gorgeous.  They cover almost every kind of music that there is to cover, and what they didn't cover in Blur, they did in Gorillaz.  Definately look into all of Damon's works, not just this.  Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
0790729652|5.0|Hollywood has a penchant for making great movies and then putting out beyond crappy sequels that have zip to do with the original.  The Batman series was no exception.<br /><br />But watching this on TV not too long ago, I, too, had forgotten just how good the original was and how it stood out then and now.  While Tim Burton's sets and movie making have become  predictable, he made quite an impression in 1989 with Batman.  The movie did receive one of the greatest amounts of publicity I had ever seen until that point in time (we kept hearing about how much money it cost to make) but this is actually one film that deserved the copious amount of hype.<br /><br />Michael Keaton (fresh off \\"Beetlejuice,\\" another Tim Burton film), Kim Basinger, and Jack Nicholson had great chemistry.  When you see Jack Nicholson's name, expect a quality, powerful performance.  Keaton seemed tailor made for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman and Kim Basinger played the part of Vicky Vale very convincingly.<br /><br />Batman is one of those movies that stands out from the rest.  It was original and innovative.<br /><br />Indeed, Hollywood needs to take a look at this to learn how to adapt movies from the printed medium (books, comic books) the right way.
B0007O38F8|5.0|I'm a 50 Cent and G-Unit fan and understand if you like other artist and are true fans of the people 50 diss then you not going to like 50Cent and G-unit. I like the music Fat Joe, Jada Kiss, Nas and Shyne makes and still like G-unt music. Its all about Ja Rule and murder Inc being on 50cent Sh*t List. Anyone supporting him and the Inc will get it from 50 and G-unit so theres nothing that can be done. I'm from Brooklyn and I know what 50 is doing. All the haters should stop hateing because your not getting paid for hateing so its not worth it. The CD is good and almost all the beats are good. His lyrics are Hot and he flows on corny beats and still makes the song good.  This CD is about 50 cent telling the world he's on top and is rich as hell. He has Vitamin Water, G-Unit Clothes, G-Unit Sneakers made by Rebook, Rebook is kissing 50 cent BUTT because of all the sales. And he has G-Unit, meaning He put LLyod Banks, Young Buck and The Game on the label,  and 50 is making money if these guys make money. Thats how business is and wont stop because everytime 50 makes money Eminem makes money, and last but not least Dr Dre makes money from Eminem. Its a big chain. I had to break it down to all the little kids and slow people out there that hate. Anyway, go out and get the Album its good. G- Unitttttttttttt !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Troy is 2 hours too long. If you fast forward and just watch the fight scenes, it's a pretty entertaining hour of action. The giant battles are fun although not original, and the final showdown between Achilles and Hector is excellent. That being said, the rest of the movie is atrocious. Within the first five minutes the dialogue reveals itself as laughable. It's sad because there are plenty of good actors wasted here. It also makes sense that half the actors were stolen from Lord of the Rings and Braveheart, since this is the 400th big budget rip off to come out in the last five years. Don't these people realize that just because you have a lot of extras shooting arrows, that doesn't mean your movie is good? So sad. Oh and Brad Pitt should NEVER be allowed to have an accent in a movie, or act in a period piece for that matter. I don't know if he was trying to speak with an accent or just delivering his lines terribly - either way, he needs to stick to playing weirdos and murderers ala Kalifornia and 12 Monkeys. Sorry ladies, but he sucked in this flick, and his performance helped attribute to Troy the movie feeling longer and more tiring than the actual Trojan War.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Prepare to retrieve your lower jaw from the floor. The Mars Volta are true artists knocking themselves out in intense exercises of pure musicianship, and all you can do is either jump on this sonic locomotive or let it run you over. This second album is a gigantic song cycle of lengthy explorations mixing aggro, latin, free jazz, and the heavier tendencies of mid-70s prog rock (think of the least pretentious moments of Pink Floyd or Rush from that period), into a brainmelting onslaught for the thinking rocker. Don't approach this album like you can listen to it in the background and mellow out to it. This music requires concentration.<br /><br />Cedric Bixler Zavala's lyrics are even more disturbingly allegorical (imagine that), as this is his latest dense philosophical opus inspired by the tragic death of a troubled friend. As an added surprise, Cedric has added some Spanish lyrics here, jumping around between tongues in ways that will perplex even the most brilliant linguist. We learn here that Spanish and English are vocally expressive in differing ways, adding yet another confounding element to the group's sound. Cedric also continues to be one of the few rock frontmen these days who is versed in the true art of singing, as opposed to mere vocalizing. Omar Rodriguez-Lopez has really launched himself into outer space here, creating compositions that jump jarringly among probably every musical style he could think of, and some that might only be known to aliens, all presented with technical ferocity. We also experience more of a full working band this time, with all regular group members, as well as the guests, playing their guts out in accomplished fury. My favorite is relentless drummer Jon Theodore, who surely understands everything from jazz to metal to funk, and becomes the superglue holding all this insanity together. Props also to keyboardist Ikey Owens, particularly for his melancholy mindwarp solo at the end of \\"The Widow.\\"<br /><br />This album does have lots of experimental noodling and sonic exploration, which is surely a turn-off for casual listeners, though such passages are usually welcome breathers amidst the harsh soundstorm. The only track that is unduly damaged by this is \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore,\\" which has a hard time getting off the ground as a result. But the album truly centers around \\"L'Via L'Viaquez,\\" which sounds like it was created by a salsa band trapped in the evil depths of an insane asylum; and the stupendous 32-minute \\"Cassandra Geminni\\" (represented by eight tracks on the CD), which is overwhelming and indescribable, exploding your mind and every preconceived notion you may have about what rock is supposed to sound like. Nothing else on Earth sounds like this, and nothing ever will.

B00005NWM3|1.0|Starting off with the good- Let me just say that this has got to be the best cd ever made. Nickelback's music makes me feel great. I would have to say my favorite tracks are ' Look What Your Money Bought ' because it gets me bouncing and 'Hollywood' because it's catchy and plus Hollywood is good. I actually went to one of my good friend's  (76year old jimmy magee) parties and it was soooo fun. We popped pop corn and rented movies. Then his mother ordered us a pizza. Get this, we got to stay up past our bedtime's (9:30) we stayed up to at least 10:03. I strongly suggest this cd for having a cool time. Warning!  I was beaten badly when his mother came home while we began  throwing another unauthorised wild house-party in jimmy's house whilst listening to this. Crazy Crazy Crazy. For some reason Chad's girly voice seems to make me go bananas in pyjamas.  Truly this is one of the best albums in the history of this great nation, and it would be un-American to pass on such a fine collection of songs. <br /> <br />yeah hey, all you Chad haters, you all wrong. your'e lame enought to be critisizing him. hey, he makes more bling bling then you'll ever make! instead of making fun of him, u lowlife idiots, why don't you go and do something good for a change....go and kiss his @$$...... This is a great, vibrant and energized bubblegum mix of music for young children - my 7 year old has had it for over a year and still loves it. My neighbor, as a result, plans on getting it for her 8 and 6 year old girls because they love it as well. The writer before me was OBVIOUSLY writing a joke of some sort about the album, a poor joke at that <br /> <br />Now for the bad, If you listen to his album, you'll laugh so hard at Chad's attempt to rap that you'll cry. You shouldn't even have attempted it, Chad. Go sit in a corner and pick your nose, tease little girls, play with toys...just leave the rapping to the grown-ups. The only reason this little boy has sold ANY albums at all is due to air-headed pre-pubescent girls who are too googly-eyed over anything Chad to realize how much this attempt just plain SUX, and wouldn't know what real RAP or real MUSIC is if it hit them, anyway. My little great grandson paid 13.98 for this CD at Wal-Mart 3 weeks ago and sold it at our yard sale for 2.50 1 week later. TAKE A Hint. Chad has a voice as squeaky as a little girl age 8. Just another white suburban man being a hip hop wanna be--which makes his \\"all american white man\\" album cover even more comical and ironic. And I'm sure he has a lot of street credibility \\"rapping\\" about sleep overs, bed wetting, and Pokemon cards. He can't sing either--I bet he is really bad without all those Mickey Mouse Club background singers drowning him out and giving the impression he can actually carry a tune. <br /> <br />Now for the ugly,  Chad Kroger should just take the money he made on this lump of feces to go to DisneyWorld and meet up with Mickey Mouse, their voices sound the same. Unless you're a fan of Alvin & The Chipmunks, don't buy this. Save your money for real music. Stop judging so called \\"artists\\" on look, and judge on talent. Buying their records only make them more bloated and narcissistic than they already are. Ooooh, Narcissistic, what a big word. You know, these little 12-year-old girls who \\"luv\\" Chad are really pathetic. They're really dumb, they can't even spell. They say he has a \\"great\\" voice, and they wanna marry him! But does cHAD know about that? He's pathetic and so are his fans <br />
0446677450|2.0|This is a great motivational book for the financial neophyte that wants to take charge of their life. That being said, there is NO information in this book to do just that! Robert T. Kiyosaki can spin an interesting tale of rags-to-riches thru sweat 'n toil, but he is too busy tooting his own horn to give you any insights. As I was reading this book I was waiting for the details, instructions, SOMETHING to point me in the direction to financial freedom that Robert T. Kiyosaki was talking about, but NOTHING! I'll give it 2 stars for an interesting, albeit fictional, story.
B000089RVX|1.0|Recently I had the misfortune to be given this cd by a homeless man. I was coming home from my job at the paper clip factory, where I put paper clips into cardboard boxes, when I passed a man asking for spare change. I apologized because I had none to give him, and he handed me this cd. \\"Take this,\\" he said in his grizzled wino voice. \\"I tried to sell it to make money for food but no one would buy it.\\"<br /><br />I would probably be able to completely ignore the existence of this whiney little boy band if it wasn't for song 4 \\"My Immortal\\". This song gives me a new reason to feel rage. ! It's a song about cheating. When I hear that song I have to fight the urge to break stuff. I don't care if the rest of their music is great. Just for singing that song they should have to bow down and kiss the feet of every old man they see. If I could give any CD by these guys a zero, I would. This is basically due to the fact that this is not music, it is record executive product designed to prey upon the mindless public's addiction to unabridged cheezy music. This genre of music is so manufactured that it's motives are highly questionable.<br /><br />As one of the greatest muscioligist from the last century I can't believe I'm actually partaking in reviewing a \\"boy band,\\" but I couldn't help. I have nothing really to say about the band or the album because I haven't heard it(nor do I intend to). I just think it's incredibly amusing to read all these silly comments made by teenage girls (or boys, but to a lesser degree). It's like they live on a different planet where everything is trite and inane!!<br /><br />iTS FUNNY you girs who say I love you jeff or i love you justin timberlake. This band was started to gain mass profit and fame, not to express passion through music and give their hearts out. The shame of being actually in one of these bands is quickly overridden by the mass amounts of beautiful women(I cant blame em, as much as they do suck)They are money hungry and fame hungry,not caring like you think they are. They are probably very simple minded and boring, even though they are \\"hot\\". dont believe their lie. the only positive thing is that there are 4 guys instead of five, which shows some amount of individuality(not. All shallow teenage girls listen: You will love these guys! they have no talent, no lyrical abilities, and cant dance! They do however have what you love, which is a whiny voice, a pretty face, and a good melodic song(which they didnt write) Remember Leif Garret? well, he is ridiculed now, and so will all teeny boppers in 10 years<br /><br />To sum up: While yes I do concede this boyband are a slight cut abouve the rest with their unique mixing of nu-metal angst with bubblegum pop as exemplified by the song \\"Bring Me Back to Life\\" which has uncomfortable connotations for me due to it's use by the anti-ethunasia lobby who dont understand us old folk who just wanna lie down and die. What really depresses me to the core of my existense is these men who insist on singing like girls. I cant get over who much the lead vocalist of this band shrieks like a little girl. This guy looks so much like a girl, he's such a freak. Why do people like him? he's the Tom Green of music, liked for hhis utter weirdness. This sounds like music from a greasy, quirky demon from the bowls of Hell. His voice is really annoying, he's like whining and screaming and crying. If you're ever in the mood for Evanesecense, scratch your nails across a chalk board, it's the same thing, it will likely satisfy the disturbing urge that won't last long anyway. and I'm not joking. there's like 1 good song on it, the rest are trash. he sounds like a pre-teen girl when he sings and their songs suck.
B00003CXCT|2.0|When I was younger I was an ardent fan of Star Wars, and I was eagerly looking forward to finally owning the original trilogy on DVD.<br /><br />Yeah, it may have taken a while, but they have finally been released!<br /><br />When the set finally arrived in the mail, I couldn't wait:  I stirred myself a large glass of Kool-Aid and unwrapped the handsome box.  Unfortunately, in my excitement, I spilled the Kool-Aid all over the package and the DVD's -- and the couch.<br /><br />Now, not surprisingly, the stupid things do not run properly.  They skip and freeze, and at times will hardly play at all.<br /><br />My (former) friends have cautiously suggested that all this was largely my fault.  Nevertheless I am skeptical.  I cannot help but suspect that LucasArts had something to do with this.<br /><br />Why didn't they include Kool-Aid protection on the disks?  Why was there no warning about not handling Kool-Aid around the disks?  Why is it only now that I am learning of the effects of this otherwise innocuous beverage on their flimsy product?<br /><br />In fact, the more I think about it, the more I think it's possible that the disks in fact CAME SHIPPED with the Kool-Aid already on them, and that in my anger I'm just mixing things up.  But why LucasArts would ship their new Star Wars disks out all sticky and red is beyond me.  Perhaps to sell more?<br /><br />I don't know.  So all I can do is discourage you from buying it: the disks are coated in a mysterious red, sticky substance (God only knows where from) which seems to be impeding their proper operation.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie was simply amazing. Although it was full of tearjerking cliches, it's just one of those addicting movies that you still think about days after. Although the whole plot was wonderful, I would have to say that the scenes in the beginning of the movie of the one summer was what I enjoyed most and could watch over and over. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good old-fashioned tearjerker romance, which I must say is my favorite kind of movie. The rich girl/boy from the wrong side of the tracks love story never ceases to get old for me. The image of Ryan Gosling half naked doesn't hurt either.
B000002UB6|5.0|....it's the bleedin' Beatles how can it be anything less than a fiver?! <br />The album is killer, warts and all, no matter who you credit the production too.  <br />Personally, many of my favorite lps come at the tail end of a bands career. Think Velvets, think Smiths, think Pixies. And it all began with the Beatles! <br />What sand to even consider throwing in such trivial matter such as Dig It! KGB/BB KING....BRILLIANT! <br />I can admit that yes the quality control dropped a bit by '69, but what do you expect from anyone who recorded at the pace these lads did from '64 until '70? Credibility and respect alone are enough to redeem this \\"flawed\\" lp. <br />LOVE IT!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Can I rehash what 477 other people said about this film?  Not really, except to sy that I enjoy it every time I watch it (just finished).<br /><br />I haven't noticed anybody mention the sound track, which is made up of timely fiddle music and orchestration mixed.  Absolutely a winner!<br /><br />I know that this is not an amazingly helpful review. Let me just say, if you're sitting on the fence- BUY IT!
B0000029GA|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS UP THIER WITH..... <br /> <br />Lifestyles Ov Da Poor & Dangerous <br />READY TO DIE <br />ALL EYEZ ON ME AND ALL THE OTHER 2PAC ALBUMZ..... <br /> <br />THIS ALBUM IS JUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 MUCH!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|This is Gn'R's only fantastic album. Lies is a great one too but it only has 3 new songs and 4 live ones, and the Illusions have got some great cuts (like the best Gn'R ballad, Don't Cry) but also have tons of fillers. This one is my fav album. My favs are Abbey Road, Sticky Fingers, Exile On Main Street and this one, and I like this one the most, I think, though Abbey Road slowly builds on me. Anyway. From the opening Welcome To The Jungle, one of rock's finest performances, to the final moments in the Rocket Queen ballad part, this album makes a great listen. <br /> <br />Welcome To The Jungle - Again, one of rock's best. Welcome To The Jungle is a legend now, and in many sports games this is played or the players use this to intimidate their opponents. Fantastic! I love it. 10/10 <br />It's So Easy - Another favourite here. Starts off as a rocker but then becomes a pop song with somewhat different lyrics, that turn immediately into \\"turn around b**** I got a use for you!\\" after the first chorus. Anyway, It's So Easy is a great rocker. 10/10 <br />Nightrain - Okay. This one is great. Maybe better than Welcome To The Jungle. Few songs beat that dramatic riff opening, when Axl's lyrics come in and then he does some great singing featuring rap (well, he's singing fast). The chorus on this one features great Izzy/Slash guitars, and the solo is weaved between the two, though the solo highlight is the outro with Slash playing a great one. 10/10 <br />Out Ta Get Me - The most punkish song to now isn't a filler but it isn't a classic. Out Ta Get Me features some of Axl's best lyrics ever, and at the end of the three-guitar solo comes in a great pedal effect. If it weren't for some fantastic lyrics it woudln't be that great. 9/10 <br />Mr. Brownstone - Okay, this is a favourite among many Gn'R fans but it isn't exactly my favourite. Features a great riff and a catchy chorus, but nothing else. Originally sang by Izzy, but I heard it sucked. 8.5/10 <br />Paradise City - Thissong is great but it's way too long and I don't like the last two minutes. I think it's good for a while, but it's way better for background music. 8.5/10 <br />My Michelle - Okay, another not so good one. My Michelle is good on the first few listens but then becomes boring. Great vocals by Axl though. 8/10 <br />Think About You - OH YEAH! What a great song. Features easily the best chorus in the album, and some great lyrics. 10/10 <br />Sweet Child O' Mine - My favourite song here. Great riff, chords, verse, chorus, intervals, solo but the best part is the outro. 10/10 <br />You're Crazy - Big issue here. It's a good rocker but I never pay much attention to it, not one of my favourites either. I heard the Lies version is good. 7.5/10 <br />Anything Goes - Weakest song here though is still listeneable. Too long and repetitive, though the verse can be nice. Features a voice box by Slash. 7/10 <br />Rocket Queen - Another favourite. Starts off with the album's most dirty lyrics (after Anything Goes), with a great great funky intro. The riff is great too, using 4 notes. Then comes the solo, but the main part in the solo is the sounds of a woman having sex. Then comes the most powerful chorus, and then the song becomes a ballad, one of the best things Gn'R ever did. Lovely! 10/10 <br /> <br />Everyone should get this album. It's too great to be true!
0316172324|1.0|First 1/3 was good.  Last 2/3 was tedious and failed to deliver the books claimed reason for being.  Agree with others, take a nap and save the money and time.
B0007O38F8|2.0|Uh...I don't even know where to start on this one.  Somebody better knock some sense into 50 Cent soon because I think his fans are really disappointed with this album.  This is more than just a step back from Get Rich Or Die Tryin', it's about 1000 steps back.  I'm not a huge fan of 50 Cent but I have heard this album and it is nothing like his fist album.  I don't get why some artists want to mess with the formula of success *cough* *50 Cent* *cough* <br /> <br />1. Intro (Skit) - Decent intro    <br />2. In My Hood - Horrible flow, horrible verses and chorus 1/5 <br />3. This Is 50 - Decent lyrics, bad flow 3/5 <br />4. I'm Supposed To Die Tonight - Finally a good song 5/5 <br />5. Piggy Bank - Lame diss, nice flow and chorus 3/5 <br />6. Gatman And Robbin - (with Eminem) - Em kills 50 again 4/5 <br />7. Candy Shop - (with Olivia) - Overplayed single, nice beat 3/5 <br />8. Outta Control - Good flow and good lyrics 4/5 <br />9. Get In My Car - Awesome chorus and a good flow 5/5 <br />10. Ski Mask Way - Decent song, nothing special 3/5 <br />11. A Baltimore Love Thing - Uh.... 2/5 <br />12. Ryder Music - Pretty good song 3/5 <br />13. Disco Inferno - Nice flow, chorus, and beat 4/5 <br />14. Just A Lil Bit - Yeah, just a lil bit better 2/5 <br />15. Gunz Come Out - Nice chorus and lyrics 5/5 <br />16. My Toy Soldier - (with Tony Yayo) - Yayo outshines 50 5/5 <br />17. Position Of Power - Gay song 1/5 <br />18. Build You Up - (with Jamie Foxx) - Decent song 3/5     <br />19. God Gave Me Style - WACK 1/5 <br />20. So Amazing - (with Olivia) - Good song 3/5   <br />21. I Don't Need 'Em - Decent song 3/5 <br />22. Hate It Or Love It - (G-Unit remix, Bonus Track, with The Game/Tony Yayo/Young Buck/Lloyd Banks) - BEST SONG 10/5 <br /> <br />Overall I gave this album 2/5 because it just doesn't live up to the hype and 50's flow is wack, I think just about every guest on hear outshined him.  I would only suggest this album to die hard G-Unit fans.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm not going to go into detail about each individual song because I don't want to set expectations for each song. This album is brilliant. Green Day's consistently good work is what makes them so great.  <br /> <br />I rate it the best album of 2004.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|this movie was so bad, when the other reviewers are creating parameters just to watch the movie you know its bad. if i have to be a certain age or have a certain level of dorkiness about me to enjoy the movie, then its a dorky movie, a dorky terrible movie. not even worth renting
0060763280|5.0|The nasty reviewers amaze me! You are so off the mark here that it boggles the mind.  <br /> <br />How on earth does one become a Top Rated Reviewer on Amazon by reviewing books that he hasn't even read?  <br /> <br />I ask this because you obviously haven't read the book.  <br /> <br />Harv's message is that positive thinking doesn't work.  <br /> <br />I repeat: it doesn't work.  <br /> <br />The entire book is meant to drill into readers the fact that if you want to succeed, you need to get off your butt and take action. You need to start a business and begin making things happen in the real world.  <br /> <br />If you had bothered to actually read the book, you'd recall the page where he talks about meditating and visualizing wealth but never having it drop into his lap.  <br /> <br />His entire message is that thinking about wealth won't do it. To make it happen in your life you need to get off your butt, roll up your sleeves, and \\"just do it\\".  <br /> <br />After reading the book, I see it as a tool for overcoming the bad habits and beliefs that fuel endless procrastination.  <br /> <br />Seriously, next time try reading a book before writing a \\"review\\". <br />
B000008LOU|4.0|I agree with most others that this album isn't as strong as Volume 1, but it's still quite good and I can't understand why its not available new. I was thinking maybe they have plans to rerelease it as an anthology, and this time their going to include Volume 2. Only a fantasy, but certainly a good one. Both Wilbury records are awesome! If you never heard them, but your fans of any of its members, buy this album.
B00026W82U|5.0|the songs are lovely and fun to listen to!!! <br /> <br />you never get sick of it
B00065LY1I|4.0|This is a great CD and a fun listen, and makes a great introduction for the novice American, but several key tracks are missing for whatever reason, and considering that disc one is short of an hour long, there would have been plenty of room on this collection for these (short) songs to have made a truly timeless and ultimate Kylie Minogue collection. <br />Missing in action are:  <br />1. \\"It's No Secret\\" which was her only other U.S. top 40 hit prior to \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head.\\" Why???? How dumb. Automatically makes this collection imperfect for U.S. shoppers. <br />2. \\"Word Is Out\\" Big U.K. hit <br />3. \\"If You Were With Me Now\\" another big hit, this time pairing Kylie with the smooth Keith Washington. This song is definately missed. <br />4. \\"Finer Feelings\\" another great song, and big hit. <br />5. \\"What Kind Of Fool\\" another great song, big hit, and the \\"other\\" new song from her 1994 Greatest Hits CD (which includes all these missing songs from this set) <br />6. \\"Where Is The Feeling\\" <br />7. \\"Some Kind Of Bliss\\" a big hit from her indie 90s days... <br />8. \\"Cowboy Style\\" a hit in certain countries <br />9. \\"Your Disco Needs You\\" another song that was a hit in some countries, and would have made an awesome additin to this album, as it's one of her coolest songs. <br />10. \\"Butterfly\\" a hard to find US dance hit that made waves prior to \\"Fever\\" <br />11. The U.S. single/radio mix of \\"Love At First Sight,\\" which was the hit version in the U.S. and virtually impossible to find. <br /> <br />Oh well, next time. I do love \\"I Believe In You,\\" that alone makes this set worthwhile in my eyes.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Judas Priest is a young band still, maybe their members are no longer but Priest as a whole unit it is, because their source of energy is awesome and seems to be endless , Halford vocals and shouts make you feel chill yet , now a darker new incarnation of the band released the songs contained in Angel of Retribution, they are in this days an evil force, Halford actually looks and sounds just like the Devil himself , Tipton riffs are not as agressive as in \\"jugulator\\" or \\"demolition\\" but definitelly are dark and like taken directly from hell, riff intro for \\"Judas is rising\\" sound stuning (did you know he can do this riffs with just one hand?), \\"deal with the Devil\\" is a perfect and appealing follow up Scott Travis drum banging is capable to blow your mind , bass guitar from Ian Hill is sinister check out \\"revolution\\" intro, \\"Angel\\" track maybe is not a good one, is booring and tedious but provides the calm space you need in the middle of all the madness, but all is back to normal with \\"hellrider\\", \\"Demonizer\\" is maybe the heaviest song of the album Halford s vocal pyrotechny is like out of this world you end tired after hear this track, \\"worth fighting for\\" will remain to you \\"turbo\\" times is kinda pop but in Priest terms (youll figure out when you hear) \\"Lochness\\" is a long and epic closing track that maybe many will find interesting , maybe others will think that would have been better if they would record two energetic last songs instead, well i think this way, Angel of Retribution is an amazing comeback, now lets wait to see if this reunion last a reasonably time, after all they have been for three decades present they cant be eternall, but while Judas exists we can enjoy their existence  <br />HM  <br /> <br />
B000002AGN|5.0|In sixth grade, which is more years ago than I care to remember, I had a music teacher who taught me, or at least attempted to teach me the clarinet. He did not create a budding musician, but he did introduce me to all sorts of music which I am sure helped instill a love of music in me. He was a classical oboist, who had once played with a major symphony orchestra, but an accident prevented him from continuing this career and spent the rest of his musical life teaching young children, most of whom only wanted a reason to leave class, how to play various wind instruments. If he sensed that young people in his charge were truly interested in music, regardless of ability, he organized a special section where he not only taught the instrument, but played recordings of great musicians. One recording he played for us was an LP version of TIME OUT by The Dave Brubeck Quartet. We thought \\"Blue Rondo a Turk\\" was humorous and loved \\"Take Five.\\" I enjoyed the music so much I asked to borrow the album, which he agreed to, listened to it at home, and like any klutzy sixth grader, I scratched it and it skipped across \\"Everybody's Jumpin\\". My parents did replace it.<br /><br />The reason I share this little anecdote is not to stroll down memory lane, but to share a story about a recording that is now a classic and how much these great recordings can add to a person's love of music. Brubeck's sound is instantly recognizable to many listeners today, has inspired countless others, and is a part of our musical heritage. Critics praised the work when it was first released and audiences loved it. It was one of the first jazz albums to top the Billboard album charts in the general category. I have quiet a few jazz recordings in my collection, many by great performers, but every time I listen to this collection I get a sense of something authentic and original. I recently listened to the recording with young listeners nearby, and in an age of music generated and inspired by who knows what, pieces like \\"Take Five,\\" \\"Blue Rondo a Turk,\\" and \\"Kathy's Waltz\\" proved they still have a magical appeal to people of all ages.<br /><br />To my music teacher who played excerpts from this album, thank-you not for getting my classmates and me out of science class, but for exposing us to great music. And thank-you to The Dave Brubeck Quartet for giving us music that will last a lifetime.at, pieces like \\"Take Five,\\" \\"Blue Rondo a Turk,\\" and \\"Kathy's Waltz\\" proved they still have a magical appeal to people of all ages.  <br /> <br />To my music teacher who played excerpts from this album, thank-you not for getting my classmates and me out of science class, but for exposing us to great music.

B0001MDP3G|3.0|I had problems with two aspects of the film:<br /><br />1.  The acting by Nicole Kidman was a cardboard cutout of the stereotypical Southern belle and seemed too concerned with her accent and mannerisms to give much attention to personality.<br /><br />2.  The lack of homework on the albino character of Bosie.  This was played, however, very chillingly by British actor Charlie Hunnam, whom I failed to even recognize until I saw his name in the credits.  He plays the title role in \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\" and is unrecognizable in \\"Cold Mountain\\".  The fact that those who suffer from albinism have poor eyesight, which would have rendered the gunslinging exploits of bouncing Bosie improbable, seems to reflect a lack of homework on the part of the filmmakers.<br /><br />Jude Law, as always, is excellent as his character traverses the way home a la The Odyssey back to his true love.  The Civil War scenes are very heartrending.  The characters he meets along the way, including the lavicious reverend, the lonely young widow, and the hooligan hillbillies are wonderful and add much-needed respite from the weightiness of the Civil War subject matter.<br /><br />Renee Zellwiger, one of my favorite actresses, is a bit over the top, but a wonderful character that took the pain out of watching the scenes with the boring Kidman character.<br /><br />I recommend this movie, but not as a true-to-canon depiction and not as a definitive authority on 1860s history.  For entertainment purposes, though, it is certainly worth seeing.
B00005Y7GQ|5.0|For those who may be familiar with Steven Chow, the fun of watching this movie will be no surprise. For those less familiar with the Chinese superstar's films, he has been described as the heir apparent to Jackie Chan in terms of slapstickish martial arts comedy. Admittedly, for those who are looking for the sort of stunts that Chan has become famous for they might be somewhat disappointed. CGI is very apparent throughout the movie, although not overwhelmingly so. Chow's skewering of pop culture in his quest to find a way to make money out of being a Shaolin Monk in the modern world, however, by far overshadows the special effects and places this comedy firmly in a catagory of its own. And for those who can overlook the fact that CGI is used for some of the stunts and enjoy the impossible feats of Chow and his \\"brothers\\" (such as the Matrix-esque human-pinball fight scene behind the brick wall and the climactic final match), an enjoyable evening of laughs should ensue. Being an import, though, some of the translations seen in the subtitles can be, shall we say, creative. Also, don't miss the deleted scenes, particularly the huge dance number in the streets of China.
B0000029GA|5.0|I'm glad the Source gave this classic album by Nas 5 mics because it is truly a lyrical masterpiece! This album, released in 1994, very may well be the single most influential album in the history of rap music because it spawned an entire generation of copy-cats who would try to emulate Nas' style. They failed! Just cop this album and enjoy the songs knowing you don't have to press fast forward because all the songs are great!
B00001QEE5|5.0|Purchased this thru Rare Videos in FlA. via Amazon. It was as advertised, English, Widescreen Version, excellent sound & NEW. I would recommend Rare Videos for other DVD's which are unavailable for purchase in retail or discount stores. Am thrilled to be sending to my grandson for his birthday. Forgot what a delightful movie this was until I reviewed it before sending it on to him (5 yrs. old).
B0000039PW|5.0|This album defines what true hip hop is! 1994-1996 was the golden age of hip hop when Nas, Wu, and Biggie dropped classic albums! If you don't own \\"Ready to Die\\" then you're not a true hip hop head!
B0007MVXQG|4.0|Yeah, this is a pretty good comeback album.  I've only actually got 3 Priest studio albums other than this one, though one of them is 'Painkiller' their last album with Halford prior to the breakup, which I suppose will provide a good basic stylistic comparison.  Stylistically, 'Angel of Retribution' is largely a modernized 'Painkiller', meaning that the song writing and riffwriting are much the same, though it tends to be a fair bit darker and bassier (w/down-tuned guitars), and a fair bit slower.  As such, the album is perhaps not quite as bluntly cheesy as 'Painkiller' was, meaning it's also a bit less fun.  However, the whole album isn't like this, so it's a bit more varied than 'Painkiller' was.  Overall, this is just a good metal album.  Not great, but worth having.<br /><br />The band sounds good.  Halford doesn't give as good or varied a vocal performance as he can, but he's still one of the best metal vocalists around.  Tipton and Downing aren't as good on the lead guitar as they can be, either, but the leadwork is good, classicist metal stuff, and definitely better than what you'll usually hear.  Lotsa people are real big on Scott Travis, but I don't find him all that thrilling.  He uses lots of nice double bass, but his fills and drum patterns don't really interest me all that much.  He still gets the job done.  It also has an interesting, rather thunderous drumsound which don't hear as much nowadays.  It works.<br /><br />The modernized 'Painkiller' description applies in particular to 'Judas Rising', 'Deal with the Devil', 'Demonizer', 'Wheels of Fire' and 'Hellrider'.  These songs all work at least pretty well, and are fun, with nice catchy choruses.  However, they don't seem as energetic as they ought to.  I don't know if this is in the production or in the performance, but most of the album doesn't have the sorta drive that it ought to have.  This doesn't kill the album, but it does hurt it.  The five aforementioned songs aren't terribly varied, though some do distinguish themselves a bit.  'Judas is Rising' is probably the most anthemic of them, though it's riffwork isn't as solid.  'Demonizer' is probably the darkest and heaviest of them, with some thrash flavoring.  'Wheels of Fire' is a bit groovier, a bit more rockish, but still very effective.  The other tracks are a bit different.  'Revolution' is a bit more modern, has got some weird riffwork and is a bit more of a groover.  Pretty decent, though not one of the best songs on the album.  'Worth Fighting For' is the first ballad, and it's a pretty solid one.  It was a little bland on the first few listens, but once you listen to it a bit the melodies creep into your mind.  The chorus is quite solid, with good harmony, and the sad little guitar line that is repeated quite a few times is very nice.  'Angel' is another ballad, not as strong as 'Worth Fighting For', and a bit more of a conventional power ballad, but it still works well enough.  The album closes with the the 'Eulogy/Lochness' epic.  'Lochness' is a dirgey, 13+ minute epic about the Loch Ness monster, and let me assure that it's even cheesier than you're imagining.  It's a little too plodding at times, and doesn't have quite as much going on as it ought to for a song of that length, but it's still a fun and effective if very silly album closer.  The chorus is kinda hypnotizing, as is the whole song, really.  Good fun.<br /><br />Yeah, check it out.  Nothing amazing, but definitely a solid, worthwhile metal album from Judas Priest., though some do distinguish themselves a bit.  'Judas is Rising' is probably the most anthemic of them, though it's riffwork isn't as solid.  'Demonizer' is probably the darkest and heaviest of them, with some thrash flavoring.  'Wheels of Fire' is a bit groovier, a bit more rockish, but still very effective.  The other tracks are a bit different.  'Revolution' is a bit more modern, has got some weird riffwork and is a bit more of a groover.  Pretty decent, though not one of the best songs on the album.  'Worth Fighting For' is the first ballad, and it's a pretty solid one.  It was a little bland on the first few listens, but once you listen to it a bit the melodies creep into your mind.  The chorus is quite solid, with good harmony, and the sad little guitar line that is repeated quite a few times is very nice.  'Angel' is another ballad, not as strong as 'Worth Fighting For', and a bit more of a conventional power ballad, but it still works well enough.  The album closes with the the 'Eulogy/Lochness' epic.  'Lochness' is a dirgey, 13+ minute epic about the Loch Ness monster, and let me assure that it's even cheesier than you're imagining.  It's a little too plodding at times, and doesn't have quite as much going on as it ought to for a song of that length, but it's still a fun and effective if very silly album closer.  The chorus is kinda hypnotizing, as is the whole song, really.  Good fun.  <br /> <br />Yeah, check it out.  Nothing amazing, but definitely a solid, worthwhile metal album from Judas Priest.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Since you 230-strong sadistically specialize in needily depending on self-destructed musicians, AT LEAST have the grudgingly half-decent (because sinful idolism's censurable NO MATTER who you subject yourselves to) sense and taste to idolize someone whose music isn't as tragically vomitous as Self-destroyer's!!!! I command you to idolatrize Kurdt Kobain, AND NO ONE ELSE, because at least his music didn't suck, comparable to your lowness of Zevon hero worship, that is. The last and final insult which overstepped the line for me is Zevon's four-eyed face on the jacket of Breaking Wind. This cancer-afflicted suicide is blatantly plotting to capitalize on feloniously easy, subdued, weak sympathy from liberals!!!! Zevon accomplishes this by scornfully plastering his soon-to-be-deceased, cancerously tumorous prison mugshot on the sleeve.

You will read about the things they all share in common and what they did differently from those who failed. It is logical, exciting, and well supported.  I trust what I read and benefited greatly from reading this text.
B00004R9A4|5.0|I was 7 years old when this film came out in the theater, just the perfect age for it, and I remember dragging my poor parents to see it several times (my father was bored to tears, I remember that clearly). <br /> <br />I recently ran into this DVD at the public library, and today I watched it again for the first time in over 33 years.  Fortunately, it has lost little of its magic.  The songs are just as catchy as ever, and the \\"Briny Ballroom\\" scene is worth the price of admission alone.  The song \\"Age of Not Believing\\" is excellent, even better than the much-maligned \\"Cheer Up Charlie\\" in \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" (another of my childhood favorites). <br /> <br />Even as dated as the special effects are, the flying bed scenes still look magical (particularly the first one).  There aren't enough of them though... you got a flying bed, you should use it!  Anyway, I've got a warm feeling after seeing this movie again, and the songs just keep replaying themselves in my head.  The only problem I have with Disney's re-release is the extended (waaaaaaayyyyyy toooooo extended) \\"Portabello Road\\" scene.  This was just unnecessary, and would have put me to sleep as a kid. <br /> <br />It's been noted that this film is overshadowed by \\"Mary Poppins.\\"  Well, any film would be.  Despite some weaknesses of this particular release, I can't recommend it enough -- particularly if you saw it as a kid.  Let your kids experience it too.
B0000214F0|3.0|I can see how shocking and ground breaking this film may have been at the time it debuted, but today it seems more campy than controversial.  McDowell's Caligula, and just about every other charater is cartoonish and surreal.  The sets are bathed in artificial pools of colored lights, the cast looks scrubbed and shiny.  It is all pure fantasy, a la Tinto Brass (and Guccione), and therefore there is always a sense of disconnect between viewer and character(s).  If one of the main themes was to show man's inhumanity to man, then the film fails.  Still, everyone should see it once.  Caligula  would make a GREAT remake,  ...too bad Kubrick is gone.  Maybe after losing his latest Oscar, Scorsese will say, \\"what the hell?\\" and do a controversial, realistic  Caligula  of his own.
B0001932ZA|5.0|In the near future of 2019, Television and the media has taken over the lives of many people as they watch the new century's most popular TV show which is a deadly game show entitled \\" The Running Man\\", in which sadistic gameshow host Killian ( Richard Dawson) is forced to have convicts in a large urban maze to reach the goal but sends fiendish troops called \\" The Stalkers\\" who murder the contestants off the air. However, Ben Richards ( Arnold Schwartzenger) is a former police officer accused of a major crime he didn't commit is on the loose so he can prove that he has been framed, however he is now a contestant on the cruel game show as he must battle the stalkers, prove his innocence, reach the goal and try to expose the truth of the show and how TV is controlling everyone.<br /><br />Fascinating and entertaining futuristic action-packed Science Fiction adventure that has gained a cult following since it's 1987 release and is based on a Steven King novel. Schwartzenger delievers hard as Richards along with Yaphett Kotto ( Alien) co-starring, there is some satire on the media, this is definitely one of my all time favorite movies.<br /><br />The 2-Disc DVD is a major improvement over the original release with better sound & Picture that is just great, it's extras are very good such as two featurettes on \\" Reality Show beginnings\\" and \\" about privacy issues in today's 9/11 society\\", two commentaries, trailer and info about the stalkers.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to lovers of cult movies, Sci-fi, action and fun movies!<br /><br />Also recommended: \\" The Fifth Element\\", \\" Battle Royale\\", \\" Dark City\\", \\" Total Recall\\", \\"Death Race 2000\\", \\"Rollerball ( Original)\\", \\" The Lawnmower Man\\", \\"1984\\", \\" Blade Runner\\", \\" The Matrix Trilogy\\", \\" Commando\\", \\" Predator 1 & 2\\", \\" The Terminator Trilogy\\", \\" Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky\\", \\" Surviving the Game\\", \\" Con Air\\", \\"The Warriors\\", \\"Assault on Precinct 13 ( both versions)\\", \\" Starship Troopers\\", \\" Big Trouble in Little China\\", \\" Escape from New York\\", \\"Escape from L.A.\\".g Trouble in Little China\\", \\" Escape from New York\\", \\"Escape from L.A.\\".
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|<br />OK, let's put the cards on the table. <br /> <br />Q: Is this really country music?  A: Probably not. <br />Q: Is it highly slick with any remotely rough patches smoothed over? A: Yes. <br />Q: Is it overtly calculated for mass commercial appeal? A: Without question. <br />Q: Is Shania so good looking that she'd probably have a hit making sucking and slurping noises?  A: Yup. <br />Q: Regardless, is this CD consistently entertaining from beginning to end? A: You betcha. <br /> <br />This is not a genre of music that I'm usually that keen on, but over the years I've been consistently impressed with the catchiness of Shania's singles.  I never bought the original albums because I feared the singles might be the only good stuff.  So this greatest hits package was perfect for me and did not diappoint.   <br /> <br />This CD is very generously filled and really has all the Shania Twain material casual listeners would be familiar with - unusual for a first greatest hits package.  In fact after a few listens you can program your 10-12 favorite songs for an even tighter killer collection.  This is just fun music to (for example) bounce around to while preparing dinner.  I surprised myself with how much I enjoyed this. <br /> <br />Don't get overly analytical.  This is what it is, you almost certainly have heard these songs before.  If you liked what you heard on the radio, you'll like this.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I told you people i told u people i told u people,this guy wanted 2 be Ja Rule.He didnt diss Ja Rule because he didnt like Ja,He dissed Ja because of Ja Rule's position in tha game.And all you people fell 4 it,your turning on this fake clown just like you did Ja Rule.You people(TRL and pop fans)are the reason for this fake clown.He fooled all you clowns the first album(check the title,Get Rich Or Die Tryin,thats exactly what he did he got rich off all you fools buying into him and destroying Ja Rule and it turns out he is Ja Rule now singing on hooks and doing pop songs with pop artists(everything you despised Ja Rule for).You people make me sick thats why the game is so fake and hollywood is because you people are idiots.I live by the saying If You Dont Stand 4 Something Youll Fall 4 Anything and you people fall 4 everything.This street dude fooled all you rich,middle class,college educated and headed 2 college idiots into believing his make believe life story and yall all fell 4 it like a kid in a candy store.Being truthful i havent even heard the Massacre but i saw this day coming from the jump.This just shows you how fake 99% of music fans are,there is no loyalty at all in the game anymore,people just jump on the bandwagon because the next person does,they dont think for themselves.Ja Rule was right all along,50 wanted 2 be him and he is and now you people are sick 2 your stomachs because your so dumb.That who label is full of fakes it dosent take a rocket scientist 2 figure that out,Dr.Dre used 2 wear lipstick 4 Christ sake.Feminem,50 pennies,The Lame,etc. are all talented gimmicks,thats it.I swear i wish 2pac was still alive because if he was none of these phonies would exist and if they did they wouldnt be big like they are.The fact of the matter is hip hop is a joke now and has been a joke since 96 and will continue being a joke until its tooken back and snatched from this MTV and TRL nightmare that has it in this chokehold.
B000002UB3|5.0|Yes, I come from classical background. But I think it gives me a more \\"neutral\\" perspective.  <br />In reviews, you will found there are 3 best Beatles: Revolver, Sgt Pepper and this. Revolver I liked but this is better for me. <br /> <br />At the begginning I gave a try to Sgt Pepper: it has a thing in common with what I consider it is the best jazz album: such sweet thunder (ellington): variety. There are better songs than in Abbey road but also frankly poorer. Sgt papper is impressive: best rock production but the song quality is uneven: what are doing animal sounds in a stupid song next to \\"when I'm 64\\"?????. If the song quality had been more even, surely it would have been the best rock album.  <br />What attracted me at the begginning is the sound they got in this recording: I mean the music colours. I found immediately a kind of \\"melancholy\\", a kind  of sad sound landscape as if they were saying goodbye in a musical way. I found it very touching. And I went beyond. The song level: more uniform and even: not a bad song!!! Eveyone has something to say. Of course not all are perfect but on the whole they make a good array and achieve  interesting variety. Also, as I said, they get a certain kind of \\"sound\\" behind superficial variety. Here at last Ringo shines!!! (octopus garden). But if the first part of the cd is great, the second is wonderful. the array is like a great rock symphony. it shows the fab 4 surpassing themselves.  <br />here the song writing and the musical setting all show sofisticated, vital and moving artistic witchcraft. Impossible to enchant. Recommended even to those who don't listen to rock.
B000007MVD|5.0|LIVE AT THE BBC was the test run for the three ANTHOLOGY CD's and the mega documentary series.  This was the Beatles when they enjoyed what they were doing and were energetic and enthusiastic. After listening to these recordings it is  clear to see why the Beatles were always called a musical group more than a rock group and why they really stood out from all the rest (were The Beatles a pop group that could play rock n' roll or a rock group that can play pop? This is a debate that will go on forever unanswered.). The Beatles rock, but they also loved to listen to all types of musical styles from country, blues, r&b etc. and it is very evident on '...BBC'. The stand out song here is the cover of \\"Some Other Guy\\". This was a staple of all upcoming Liverpool groups probably made popular by the British group Johhny Kid and the Pirates. The Beatles perform this song on a old black and white movie clip live from a performance from the Cavern Club shown on various documentaries. Finally it is heard digitally remastered on CD.  This is The Beatles at their rocking best with great vocals from Lennon and McCartney and great guitar work from Harrison. The song right after from the same set is \\"Thank You Girl\\". The driving force in the song is McCartney's bass playing. It's energetic and pounding. The final leg of the song ends with Ringo drum fills that showcases his drumming inventiveness. The other gem is \\"I'll Be On My Way\\" a Lennon/McCartney original that was not officially recorded on any of their albums.  The other songs show their musical influences from Chuck Berry to Little Richard and a moody rendition of Phil Spector's \\"To Know Her is to Love Her\\".Lastly, one aspect of these recordings is hearing Ringo Starr's drumming before it was subdued in the EMI studios.  All in all a must have for any Beatles collection that is so fun to listen to.
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|I had wanted to rent this movie for a very long time and finally got the opportunity a few weeks ago.  What a seriously amazing flick that makes your heart ache to be young and madly in love again.  I cried my eyes out for the last hour of the film.  I am now looking forward to reading the book as I have heard it is even better!
B0007NFL18|5.0|I have no clue why people are saying this is so bad, i listened to it and it was the best. songs like Candy Shop and Disco Inferno were a bit of a let down but the rest was great. and all you people who are dissing him bought 'Get Rich Or Die Tryin' and nearly all of you were satisfied but now you want to make his album look bad for the people that depend on these reviews on buying this album. anyone who dont like this album is ccccc-crazy!
B0006399FS|5.0|How does a band pull off music this good 25 years after their first release?  That, in my view, is unprecedented.  The disadvantage a band like this has is that anything new they release will inevitably be compared to their back catalog.  Regardless, \\"How To...\\" holds up extremely well.  Probably a notch below their very best work, but one I'll still be taking off the shelf years from now. <br /> <br />U2 received flak from some critics for reverting to their 80s sound circa Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree.  Not a fair assessment.  Although The Edge's trademark chiming guitar is more evident than it has been since then, this CD has an overall tougher and grittier sound.  Besides which, it's just great rock and roll with one catchy and memorable tune after another.   <br /> <br />There are really distinct melodies within, so don't think you know the album just from the singles (besides which, \\"All Because Of You\\" is, in my view, not one of the strongest cuts on the CD).  You'd then be missing out on tracks that should become U2 standards such as \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", \\"Origin Of the Species\\", and \\"Yahweh\\".  Altogether there are zero weak songs here.  I never find myself reaching for the skip button on any of the songs and that's rare. <br /> <br />This is a band at the top of its game and one of the most engaging rock releases so far in the new millenium.  As of this writing I think this CD still has a lot of legs, especially as their North American tour kicks into gear.
B00006DEF9|5.0|It really isn't possible to either fault at all, nor praise enough the merits of this wonderful film. An absolute classic and a must see, so much so that people who have not seen it are being pickeled, preserved and studied as rare species!
B00004ZD69|5.0|This was my introduction to Godspeed, and to post-rock too. I bought it on a whim after hearing the first 'piece', \\"lift yr skinny fists like antennas to heaven\\". And I am so glad I did. Not quite as dark as their previous album and EP, as you can tell from the moment you put on the CD. But achingly beautiful. I admit that not everyone is going to 'get it', but if you like post-rock, or just beautiful, haunting music in general, give it a go. The music flows with such grace, building gently (or triumphantly, in \\"lift yr skinny fists\\"'s case) to a climax, and slowly moving into the next piece. A soundtrack to a warm winter's day. Highly recommended.
B00001U03Q|5.0|While Eric Clapton's glory days came to a close in 1981, his music was, and still remains of high quality.  Though this compilation doesn't show the best of his entire career, it isn't really supposed to; it gives what it promises: The best of the later years, something needed to show fans that Clapton still has that same touch of genius he always did that made him so famous. <br /> <br />This compilation, although of his less famous period, contains several hits from the era of 1981-1999, Clapton's more-pop-rock period.  The compilation starts of with \\"Blue Eyes Blue,\\" and continues on with the amazing \\"Change the World,\\" my personal favorite.  Next is the dark, emotional, and powerful \\"My Father's Eyes\\".  The compilation's most covetted track, however, is \\"Tears in Heaven,\\" a song dedicated to his son who passed away in 1992; truly an amazing song and one of Clapton's most famous hits, followed by an unplugged rendition of his old classic, \\"Layla\\".  Another song similar to these two is a return to the blues which made Clapton so legendary with \\"Running On Faith,\\" and \\"Before You Accuse Me\\".  Truly a showcase to the diversity of styles presented on the compilation. <br /> <br />Clapton's essential conversion to Pop-Rock is throughly explored here as well as mentioned before.  And though it may not be expected, these are a few of Clapton's finest songs.  They're worthy of the consideration of any listener; songs such as \\"Pretending,\\" \\"Bad Love,\\" \\"It's In the Way That You Use It,\\" and \\"Forever Man\\". <br /> <br />Any Clapton collection has to contain this later years best-of.  You've heard the best of his golden age, now do the same for his later period.  However reluctant some fans may be, it's well worth it.  While this isn't the best of Eric Clapton's entire career, any fan is sure to enjoy it.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend is the best thing to happen to R&B since Stevie Wonder.  There is something so spritual about his voice it just gives you this good feeling inside.  He is brillant songwriter and singer.  LEGEND is an appropriate moniker for the former John Stephens, expect good things from this man in the future.  The standout tracks on this CD (in my opinion) are: Let's Get Lifted,  She Don't Have to Know, Ordinary People (of course), Let's Get Lifted Again and So High.  Also if you can't get enough of John Legend look into getting he independant releases, I suggest Solo Sessions Vol 1: Live at the Knitting Factory, that's if yoyu can get your hands on it.  If you do not have the CD you are missing out on one great performer.  If you get a chance to catch his live show, you should go.
B000007VCM|5.0|Originally released in 1985, this was the follow-up to their stunning debut effort 'Dreamtime'. I remember when this lp first came out as I knew several patrons that went nuts over the record. In my opinion, this is The Cult's BEST album, period. They have like three others that are good, like the previously mentioned 'Dreamtime', the fantastic 'Electric' and 'Sonic Temple'. Part British metal and part neo-psychedelic. When I saw The Cult the first two times, I thought to myself, that vocalist Ian Astbury was like Jim Morrison's long lost love child and then light years later, he toured as front-man for the 21st Century Doors. Ironic? Every tune here rocks, like the title cut \\"Love\\", \\"Brother Wolf, Sister Moon\\", \\"Rain\\" (love seeing the video on VH1 Classic), \\"Revolution\\" and \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\". A must-have.
B00028HBKM|5.0|First off, not ALL of this movie made sense to me. I don't know really what to say here because everyone else has already said everything. Some of the beginning made a little sense because I have seen \\"Life Of Brian\\" which is the exact opposite of this film. So I might have learned some things already. I do have many questions about it, though. I get why so many people were offended. Because Jesus sinned in some way. Throughout the movie, he kept praying that he, along with a few other folks would be forgiven, but THAT'S where I get confused. Oh well. I'm surprised I did understand SOME things, and yet, it's very interesting.
0312997221|5.0|Avenger, by Fredrick Forsyth, is pure, fun escapism.  Forsyth has produced a couple of hundred pages of very engaging and enjoyable adventure.<br /><br />His hero is a former Vietnam Era Tunnel Rat (real US Soldiers who were thin and brave enough to enter and clear VC tunnels single-handedly) who thirty years later lives a secret life as a highly skilled vigilante.<br /><br />The job, avenge for a Canadian industrialist the brutal killing of his grandson by a former Serbian warlord.  The problem, that Serbian warlord is thought to hold the key to solving a larger problem by some very powerful interests who think keeping him alive will serve the greater good.<br /><br />The challenge, former Tunnel Rat Cal Dexter must find and bring the notorious Zoran Zilac to justice (not just slip in and kill, mind you, but actually bring to a court of law) even while Zilac is protected by a private army in a mountain fortress, a corrupt South American dictatorship and a secret CIA group who hopes to use Zilac to get to Usama bin-Ladin.<br /><br />This is a ripping good story that moves every couple of pages.  Forsyth never lets the story settle into monotony even while giving full background and rounding out all his major characters.  The action embraces the Vietnam War, the breakup of Yugoslavia, South American strongmen and the CIA.  A great mix that Forsyth weaves together very enjoyably.
B0000029GA|5.0|Simply put it i the best work by any artist in the history of hiphop. Unbelievable lyrics all the way through.  Great street production, none of that neptune crap here pure NY beats.  From NY state of mind to the end it is the best album you could possibly buy, even 11 years later.
0802130208|5.0|This is a hilarious book from start to finish.  The main character reminds me of an early version of the Coen Brothers' Big Lebowski.  Ignatius Reilly is a a fat, gassy, opinionated man who seems to grate on everybody's nerves.    The story basically centers on his misshaps as he applies for (and bungles up) certain jobs. If you are looking for a straightforward, linear plotline, this is not the book for you. Tons of pages are taken up by the main characters monologues (which are HILARIOUS) and the characters around him are allowed to develop.  Ignatius' relationship with his mother is very funny too.  This book is highly recommended and deserves the Pulitzer Prize that it got.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|The suspense level in this movie is very high.  There is a lot of mystery involved and the plot is very interesting.  When you watch it you really have to pay attention and catch every single minute of it becasue if you miss something you won't understand the movie.  It is somewhat confusing but in an interesing way.  That is why I gave it 5 stars.   <br />The movie is about a young boy who from time to time blacks out and finds himself in situations that he doesn't remember getting into.  In order to remember these episodes of his life his mom and therapist make him keep a journal.  The boy has a very hard childhood.  A lot of things happen that torment him and cause his family to move.  When he gets older he finds himself reading back to these journals.  Everytime he reads one though he goes back to when he was young and he experiences the things that happened when he blacked out.  Things get really confusing at this point and I don't want to give the interesting parts away.   <br />The story contans some weird characters which sometimes are very scare.  Ashton Kutcher plays the main character and this role is somewhat differnt from what he usually plays.  In this movie his character and is very serious and faced with a lot of dilemas.  He does a really good job at letting the viewer experience what he is feeling.  His best friend is a really scary and weird character.  He is a young boy about 12 or 13 and he is very violent and raged for his age. <br />See the movie people, it's good.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Highly recommended. The movie succeeds because of a wonderful combination of script, music, dance, and the talent of Richard Gere. I loved ALL the supporting characters except JLo. IMHO, the woman can't act.
B000089RV6|5.0|This album is like a rite of passage.  Every teenage boy who is into hard rock/metal has to have this CD even to this day.  This is the first hard rock album(I don't really consider AC/DC metal) that I owned and I remember how blown away I was on that gray October day more than 20 years ago when I first popped into my stereo.  The intro to \\"Hells Bells\\" was perfect for the way the sky looked that day.  I still feel this is the greatest intro to any song in the history of rock.  I still get goosebumps when I hear it.  You get the feeling something really bad is getting ready to happen.  And what can you say about the title track: It kicks ass!!!  Not a throw away track on the entire CD, all killer no filler.
B00000269G|4.0|Yep, the music is worth not 5 but 6 stars. Some of the best improvisations (which are not so common) ever made. I rate it only 4 stars because thousands of people are waiting for all available music being issued. The late Henri RENAUD tried to do so in France in the 80's without success, Columbia announced a CD with bonus tracks to be released in 2004... Now we are in 2005 which means that 50 years after this marvel was recorded, unissued gems are still unavailable. Shame on SONY / Columbia
B00008ADPF|4.0|Okay Nickelback takes alot of heat for being too generic and sounding like everything else out right now.  Sure there is nothing ground breaking here and if you listen to it with that in mind this is actually pretty good.  There is much worse out there today (Blink 182 anybody?)
B0007O38F8|5.0|Yo, All I gotta say is that 50's new album is off the hook. Every track you can flow to. People say he sucks but they don't understand the business with entertainment. You can have somebody rapping underground and they will never make as much money as 50 and they would sound better. The guy is smart, I give him all the props. Go get the album, don't waste no time, guaranteed out of 22 tracks you will be bobbin your head to at least 15 songs. Trust me.. G-UNIT!!!
B00005JLEX|4.0|Seinfeld is my favorite show of all time and could not wait for these sets to come out.  Told my wife if I didn't get this for Christmas I would pitch a fit on Christmas morning and fortunately that never came to pass.  I feel the show really hit it's stride during the third season and continued to build steam.  While season 1 & 2 seem a little slow at first there are some great moments.  The Chinese Restaurant, The Revenge, The Stranded.  The episodes are little more subtle than later seasons.  The characters are still being developed especially Kramer.  You can sense there is some tension between Jerry and Kramer early on and they don't seem especially close.  You gradually begin to see Georges neurotic side especially in The Message and The Heart Attack.  You begin to see Elaines dark side during season 2.  Theres also some cool extras such as the \\"Pop-Up Video\\" style \\"Notes About Nothing\\" that you can turn off and on.  Kind of hard to follow the episodes when watching but if you're familiar with the episode and have the notes on it's pretty cool because you get a lot of background information on what went during the filming of the episode and little tidbits regarding some of the references the characters make in the show.  There is also a \\"Kramer Entrance Counter\\" which lets you know how many times overall since the series started that Kramer has barged into Jerrys apartment.  I could go on about this all night but I've got to watch \\"The Revenge\\".  Go get it!
B000002LPD|2.0|I can't believe how many people are giving this album rave reviews!  Although Hagar's lyrics are more mature than Roth's, they are also much more bland.  Eddie seems to have turned in to more of a rythm guitarist here as his crazy guitar solos and tapping segments are absent here.  I can't even understand what Hagar is saying in Poundcake.  Maybee this is a good album next to other Van Hagar music, but compared to the origonal Van Halen, and other relatively good rock and roll groups of the time, this album seems very plain.  On the other hand, if you like Van Hagar, go for it.  It's one of their better albums.
B000002KHH|5.0|Oh yes!  I remember being 14 years old sporting my mullett cruising the neighborhood on my bike(bicycle not harley) with my buddies with the boombox resting on the handlebars and having Paranoid jamming.  Well 20 years down the road and I still love this.  War Pigs, Paranoid, Iron Man, Faeries Wear Boots.  Hell there all great!  If you are a metal fan and don't have this shame on you!!  This is where it began.
B0007N1AI6|1.0|Okay. I have been reading a lot of these reviews and can understand why people think it is good: They are in denial that Priest will ever be good again. Priest was to me, like to many, the gate that opened up a new world to me. The last Priest album that was worth the money was Painkiller - everything since has been pure crap. Rob was doing great in Halford, mainly because the music sounded more like Judas Priest than Judas Priest at the time. All the years that people blamed the \\"NO-ROB\\" factor on why Jugulator and Demolition (or what ever it was called) sucked, had got it all wrong. The problem is that K.K. and Glen can't write songs anymore; their material now just plain sucks. PERIOD. To be honest, Rob's vocals on this album are not very good; not in the sense that he doesn't have any talent anymore (I know that he still has the stuff because of Halford). It just seems like he was not giving all that he had. The new Priest album has one somewhat fast song (Deal with the Devil), and the rest being either mid-paced or so slow that it was painful. It's not just the lack of speed though, check songs like \\"Freewheel Burning\\" or \\"The Sentinal\\" (spelling). These songs were not that fast, but had a furious edge to them. And when Halford used to let out that scream, YOU COULD FEEL THAT VOICE DEEP IN YOUR HEAD. That kind of Priest just doesn't exist anymore. I do not think the lyrics are as chessy as some make them out to be, except \\"Lochness\\" - that is just dumb. When I think of Priest, I think of albums like Defenders of the Faith and Screaming for Vengence - this belongs in the used bin next to Turbo and Jugulator. To put it bluntly, this album blows and I think we all have to realize that the Priest that changed the world and out lives is gone. I'm sorry to tell people this, but it is true - Priest is dead. So instead of crying about it and call them sell-outs, or pretend like the album is good or claim it has some redeming qualities, I am going to face the truth. <br/> <br />Final note - This album is not good.
B0007P3582|1.0|terrible production terrible content. dont wasste your money. get rich or die trying had memorable tracks. after playing the cd through the only track i like and can remember is hate it or love it. i bought it at target for $9 so i dont feel as bad. i watched the special on mtv with him and sway and was really looking forward to the album. especially after hearing him talk about the production and how slamming the beats were. but i wonder why he made this album. he said in the interview that if your making albums for yourself than you should keep thaat #$@% to yourself and play it in your headphones at home. after hearing the album i cant phathom that this album could've possibly been made for the 11 million americans that buy his albums.  <br />
B00005AQE8|5.0|This album is the one that the majority of people associate 2Pac with, having almost no filler whatsover and so many classic hits jammed into it.  A solid line of beats and tight lyrics that flow amazingly well with each and every track.  Both lyrics and beats cover a wide spectrum while keeping to the thug mentality and storytelling that we've come to expect from 2Pac. <br /> <br />Easily one of my ten favorite albums of all time, this could've easily been sold as two seperate albums.  I had the first CD in my player for almost two months before remembering to move onto the second CD; it's that good.  The same can't be said for other artists today making a deal about releasing two CDs at the same time *cough*Nelly*cough*. <br /> <br />From the poppin beats of \\"California Love\\" and \\"All Bout U\\" to the heavy lyrics and meaning of \\"Life Goes On\\" and \\"Only God Can Judge Me\\" to the diverse flow styles of \\"Got My Mind Made Up\\" and \\"Tradin War Stories\\", you'll find this album dominating your CD player and playlist for a long time to come.
B00005JMAH|2.0|All Harry Potter movies are great, but this one had alot of descrepancies.  A couple of them are.... <br /> <br />When Harry meets the dementors on the train, he says he hears a woman scream.  But it's never mentioned again during the film. <br /> <br />One more is the fact that they never explain why the dementors are after Harry in the first place.  They are supposed to be searching for Sirius Black. <br /> <br />However, I've never read the novels, just seen the movies.  Maybe in the novel they explain all these things.  Even the humor in the movie was dull.  Evidently the director was different or he just has made one too many of these to make this latest one good.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|I've been waiting for an album like this for quite some time. In this hodge-podge climate of music we've been in for the last five years, \\"Angel of Retribution,\\" the new Judas Priest CD, was like a breath of fresh air. While it's not the perfect album, it contains all the elements for a darn good Judas Priest album.<br /><br />1990's \\"Painkiller\\" is often revered as one of the band's best ever releases. \\"Angel of Retribution\\" fits comfortably as its follow up, but with a bit of a shift between speed metal and ballads. And to Rob Halford's credit, his voice sounds as good as ever.<br /><br />I grew up with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal in the late 70's and early 80's, and Judas Priest has always been one of my favorites. Has age dulled my taste in music? I don't think so. I'm still a fan of classic heavy metal, I like driving guitars, great riffs, but above all, I like melody. That's what I've always liked about Judas Priest, and they've almost always manged to deliver the goods.<br /><br />So is sounding just as they did back in 1990 a bad thing? Some would say yes, but to me, good music is good music, no matter when it's released.<br /><br />As for my favorites on the album, I like \\"Demonizer,\\" \\"Judas Rising,\\" and \\"Hellrider.\\" I don't like \\"Angel.\\" It just seems kind of dull and uninspired. One track I thought I'd absolutely hate, but wound up liking was the thirteen minute \\"Lochness.\\" Yeah, it's corny: \\"Loch Ness, confess your terror from the deep...,\\" but it's all in good fun.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Judas Priest, \\"Angel of Retribution\\" will fit nicely into your collection.
0060763280|5.0|This is a fabulous book for showing you how to begin your journey to wealth. As others have stated below, a simple read through will not transform you instantly into a millionaire. But no where does the author suggest that.  <br /> <br />The book most certainly will help you to develop the proper mindset for success. After reading it you will be able to discard the self-sabotaging thoughts that have kept you from success in the past. <br /> <br />It amazes me how some people have to trash Harv and his book either directly and indirectly. I suspect professional jealousy has a great deal to do with their dark motivations. A few short years ago, Harv was a nobody himself. But he put his principles into practise and rapidly built up a huge organization which helps hundreds of thousands of people. Meanwhile those left behind are stewing with envy. Rather than working on themselves and their businesses they instead choose to come here and sling mud at Harv. <br /> <br />Well, the market has spoken. Harv serves 200,000 people; they serve a dozen. <br /> <br />He who has the last laugh laughs best, as the saying goes.
0385510438|3.0|that this book probably deserves closer to 3.5 stars.  The story centers around young Willie Traynor who becomes the owner of a small town Southern newspaper. As with all small towns, news travels fast and when a horific murder is committed, the news spreads like wildfire.  Justice is demanded and small town grievances and bullies are all the talk of the town.  The last juror is really someone who Willie befriends during the course of the novel.  Less about law and more about small town life in the deep South.  The law that is referenced is obviously well reserached and the author makes note of what he cites as intentional discrepancies.  I happen to like the thrill of Grisham's earlier novels better than this one.  It reminded me too much of A Time to Kill really.  I'd recommend taking this out of the library and would suggest it as a good in flight read in lieu of a movie.
B00006AW2M|4.0|Let's face it. The Stones have done better work than Their Satanic Majesties Request. And one can't help but notice this album's debt to Sgt. Pepper. Nonetheless, it's still a fairly solid effort, with some great songs. Citadel, Sing This All Together, She's a Rainbow, 2000 Man, and most especially, 2000 Light Years From Home are all amazing songs. Also, I'd like to point out to another reviewer that after 1970, the Stones made two fantastic albums, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main St. (the latter often considered to be their finest effort), and in 1978 released another classic, Some Girls. Being that I don't have a favorite Stones song, per se, I would like to point out that one of my favorites is \\"Sister Morphine\\" (1971), and also \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" (1978). Notice the \\"made after 1970\\" thing. Sure, the Stones were influenced by the Beatles, but what rock band wasn't? And if Bob Dylan hadn't come along, the Beatles wouldn't have started writing material that didn't concern love in the first place. So there.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Let me start of by saying that Get Rich was one of the best albums of the past few years. Every track was a bomb waiting to drop. This album sounds like some dude that let fame and steriods go to his mellon. He takes no advice from Em when that is really the only person who he should be listening to.  <br /> <br />Let's cover the dis-track Piggy Bank first (actually this may be the only one I need to cover). This is the worst dis track in the history of diss tracks. When you hear some of the underground stuff that Eminem has done where he devotes minutes upon minutes ruthlessly destroying everyone from Ja Rule, to Benzino, to Dialated, to Everlast you realize the lyrcial skill he has to be able to deconstruct artists until there is basically nothing left for them to reply to because they have been destroyed. On this 3+ minute track the only clear diss is to Jadakiss, (something to the effect of don't test me if you want to eat...or something weak like that). He should have never started that with such a week track..Actually if I was Jada, I would not waste my time replying to this schlock. If I was Ja Rule I would just sit back and laugh about what happens when muscle heads try to do something other than lift weights. <br /> <br />If you are still thinking of purchasing this...I would recommend R.U.L.E. At least R.U.L.E has New York on it which is tight. I think that the 100 guns and 100 clips need to be aimed at 50.  <br /> <br />So, as I have said Piggy Bank is WEAK. Disco Inferno is OK and pretty much every other track is junk. Gatman and Robin the worst thing I have ever heard, if I was Em I would walk away fast from that one. The album is too loose and the only thing that works on it is the production. If I was Game I would take every track on this album rip it my own way and put that on the shelves to see what sells better. <br /> <br />If 50 did not have a major lable supporting him and he was selling this album out of his trunk..he would be driving a brokendown chevy nova and wearing british knights and cross colors.  <br /> <br />So, to finish, rather than buy this album you are better off doing one of the following: 1. Buy Young Buck's Album, 2. Buy The Game's album, 3. Buy them both a second time before you ever consider getting curious enough to pick up this trash. <br /> <br />
B000000W5L|5.0|As the sixties turned to the seventies the Stones had become the self proclaimed \\"Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\\",  acquired some expensive and destructive drug habits, turned into tax exiles sequestered in the Riviera, and had soaked up enough of their influences to birth this classic.<br /><br />The Stones had always been fans of Black American music such as blues, soul and gospel, and Keith had picked up country influences from his drug buddy Gram Parsons to introduce into the mix.  On EXILE they pulled all these influences together and came up with a true classic of racous, rootsy music.  EXILE is not the Stones that get played ad naseum on Clasic Rock radio (though you may hear HAPPY and TUMBLING DICE from time to time), but a gritty investigation of the very music that inspired them to form a band in the first place.<br /><br />From the feral openers ROCKS OFF and RIP THIS JOINT through the closing gospel shaded SOUL SURVIVOR the Stones are on top of there game, turning each performance into a grungy classic worthy of the Chess Records catalog.  They cover Robert Johnson (STOP BREKING DOWN) and Slim Harpo (SHAKE YOUR HIPS) as  direct tips of the hat to artists who influenced them, and a number of other songs including CASINO BOOGIE, LOVING CUP and TORN AND FRAYED sound like long forgotten blues classics.  Though this album was recorded in a villa in the south of France, it sounds like it could have been made in a Mississippi  delta juke joint.<br /><br />My favorites include the aforementioned ROCKS OFF, the crude country of SWEET VIRGINiA, LET IT LOOSE and the Chuck Berry-ish ALL DOWN THE LINE.  Though some of the songs are not classics, I don't feel that there is really a weak track on the record, or especially one that seems out of place.  This record is best enjoyed front to back as a whole album, in all it's greasy glory.  I also feel that this was the last record the Stones made where they really cared about the quality of the material instead of their market share.<br /><br />Many have claimed this to be the greatest record ever made in Rock and Roll, and though I may not always agree, it has held a spot in my ten favorite records for at least the past 25 years.l instead of their market share.  <br /> <br />Many have claimed this to be the greatest record ever made in Rock and Roll, and though I may not always agree, it has held a spot in my ten favorite records for at least the past 25 years.

B00005JNPZ|4.0|I cannot believe that Will Smith had never done a romantic comedy before \\"Hitch\\".  He has so much charisma that it would seem that he would have done about 10 of these type of movies by now.  But as it turns out, his first one \\"Hitch\\" is not bad and Will gets a little help from his co-star Kevin James. <br /> <br />\\"Hitch\\" is a man named Alex Hitchins (Will Smith).  He is a \\"date doctor,\\" meaning he helps pathetic guys to get really hot chicks that they would normally would not be able to get.  He has helped many men, and then comes Albert (Kevin James).  Albert is basically the type of guy that spills everything, says the wrong thing every time or does not have the nerve to say anything at all.  Albert wants to be able to get the movie star Allegra Coles.  So Hitch helps him and along the way he meets Sara Meles (Eva Mendes).  He falls for this girl and forgets everything that he teaches all of his clients by making a complete fool of himself.  Obviously thats where the humor comes in and then the dramtic climax of whether Hitch gets the girl or not. <br /> <br />Will Smith does a great job as this character.  As mentioned earlier, his on-screen charisma makes him the perfect choice for this character.  The person that steals this movie from him is Kevin James.  Being a big \\"King of Queens\\" fan, he is the reason that I saw this movie and he did not disappoint.  Most of the movie's big laughs came from his antics.  I didn't really like Eva Mende's character.  She was too much of a pain in the neck (to put it nicely).   <br /> <br />This movie would be definately worth the watch, especially if you have a significant other to view it with.  It is funny and romantic, but I wouldn't say that its a chick flick.  So there you go guys, this one is okay to watch.
B000002J2B|5.0|From a muscial, as well as a vocal, standpoint, this is the finest Genesis album.  The lush, intensely performed progressive rock on this album will captivate and please you as no other Genesis record can.  There is no bad song on this album, and its music will truly satisfy ones soul.  Purists insist that Peter Gabriel is the true Genesis voice, but there is no Gabriel-fronted album that is as deep-reaching as \\"Wind and Wuthering.\\"  Close runners-up to this masterpiece would be the amazing \\"Seconds Out\\" LP, which successfully conveys the power and intensity of a live progressive-era Genesis performance, and the excellent \\"A Trick of the Tail.\\"  For my ears, though, \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" represents musical perfection; this is to Genesis what \\"Brain Salad Surgery,\\" \\"Close to the Edge,\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" are to ELP, Yes, and the Beatles.  Even without Gabriel!  The one sad note about this album is it was the last true progessive peak for Genesis; once Steve Hacket departed Genesis after this LP, the group seemed to slowly lose their way musically, and while they gained enormous commercial appeal, it was at the expense of doing away with their progressive sound.  Enjoy this CD- it was written and performed from the heart!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is the single most vehement argument for not using drugs that I've ever experienced. This should be a requirement for every high school student. More shocking than *warning Spoiler* the amputated arm, or the self-deprecating sex, or the whole prison thing, was the loss of sanity by the well meaning mother whose addiction shifts from watching TV, to food, to her weight loss pills/speed, to her final obsession of a perfect life. The feeling of hollowness that is evident after watching this movie is translated to the viewer most effectively by the continuation of all the characters misery. This is left undefined and entirely to the viewer's now brutal imagination.<br /><br />This all being said this is a brilliantly filmed movie that is most certainly worth watching even if you have already decided on your opinion of drugs. It may be hard however, to see it twice. This is just a testament to how well the message comes across the first time.<br /><br />I highly recomend this movie (not literally, in fact I know people that have freaked out hardcore doing just that.)
B0000542DH|1.0|I LOVE the message of this film: The media glamorizes criminals and violence. I HATE the way they did the film: Put as much sadistic bloody carnage and brutal beatings as possible in two hours, then add in weird experimental camera work and random bits of animation. I know chastising this film for violence seems silly, but for the most part this film deals with its violence in a far too sadistic manner. I really couldn't tell where Stone was trying to go with this, since some of the violence is presented as an exciting escape from reality, while some was just disgusting for anybody (especially in the Director's Cut). The film would work if the violence had been dealt with in a manner that would make it both limited and evenly portrayed. The outrageous black comedy \\"Man Bites Dog\\" is a (ever-so-slightly) less violent and much more compelling film because the violence is presented as being a terrible and anti-human thing to do throughout the film, but gets dashed sparingly with pitch-black humor. In a Hollywood let's-blow-everything-we-can-up huge-budget auctioneer, you can tell the action and violence is fake, so you find it oddly enjoyable. Even in a serious drama like \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" or \\"Fight Club\\" we see violence as being ugly and wrong. This film can't seem to decide how it wants to portray violence, so it presents it many different ways, which really makes me second guess how well Oliver Stone told the message of the film. The nauseating camera work in the film would have been more compelling if it was used sparingly and viewers weren't simply barraged with it until our eyes hurt. If someone makes another film about how the media glorifies violence, maybe they'll learn that we really don't need to SEE all the violence and that constantly putting gruesome images in front of our eyes isn't effectively getting your point across. Maybe I'm wrong. Before you automatically agree with this, rent it and decide for yourself.
B00005JKG9|5.0|I've been in sales and have been present at many sales meetings. This movie opens with the sales meeting I sat through a hundred times if I sat through it once. my familiarity with the characters as well as the drive to be the best may jade my impression fo the film. But how can you go wrong with Pacino, Lemmon, Spacey, and the list goes on? Highly encourage this romp through the sales world for anyone looking for a great night in front of the movie screen. Also, try \\"Suckers\\" for an eqully great, funny flick about the car business.
1400034779|3.0|Follow along on dangerous journeys, stalk infaous men, and enjoy detective life with Mma Ramotswe in Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency. The story is set in present day Africa. The plot follows Mma Ramotswe through the grunt-work of being a detective. From case to case, the book will have you flipping pages until the very end. <br />     The main charecter, Mma Ramotswe, is the owner of the only Detective Agency in Botswana. Born in Botswana, Mma prides herself on her unique business and her 100% satisfaction garuntee. Mma's agency was funded by the sale of her father's cattle. Like any business, it took a while to get started, one it did Mma was inundated with clients. One client in particular kicks the plot froward. A poor Katswana schoolteacher writes to Mma and asks for her help in the disappearance of his son. Mma uses her detective skills and the help of her good friend Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni to follow the trail of the boy. The road to discovery is rocky with the potholes of witch doctors, smugglers and one of the most infamous men in the country, Charlie Gotso. To complicate matters, Mr. Matekoni proposes. Mma is in over her head, she must solve the disappearance of the schoolteachers son and decide whether she will acept Mr. Matekoni's proposal for the ulimate ending. <br />     Certain parts of the story are hard to believe. An example of this was when Mma Ramotswe was in hot pursuit of a suspect. A client asked her to see the whereabouts of one of his doctors. His erratic behavior suggested he was on drugs but the employer wanted proof first. When she followed the suspect to a house she watched from the garden of an abandonned house next door. Her detective skills failed her and the suspect spotted her. When asked what she was doing she made up a story about how she used to live in the abandonned house and she was reminiscing her days there. Suprisingly, the suspect believed her. This seemed particularly hard to believe. How couldan eductaed man believe the reason Mma was crouched in the garden was that she was reminiscing her childhood? In any case, this parallels a oint in my life when I was in Elementary school. I lost my math homework and said my older brother ate it. Since the excuse was original and the homework was difficult, my teacher brushed off the excuse with a good laugh and waved the assignment.  <br />     All in all, The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency had me flipping the pages until the very end. It was a light read that accomodated my need to get away from heavy material. For a good laugh and some thrills, read Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.
B000003TAW|5.0|The debut album for the geek, rock, band blew me away.  The very beggining of the album with, My Name Is Jonas, starts the album in the right direction. <br /> <br />The chorus's in this album are amazing.  They blew me away.  And the lyrics from, My Name Is Jonas, Buddy Holy, and Undone come with such style and rythem that I don't even care if Weezer is a geek band.   <br /> <br />When I first listened to Weezer, I thought that their music came form the 50's-60's.  The music at that time was incredible, and I love how Weezer reminded me of that. <br /> <br />When you listen to this album, you feel that a lot of thought was put into this.  With the Hits like, Buddy Holy, Undone, and Say It Ain't So, they are the main attraction.  Along with the hits come the side shows, or intermission acts.  Acting like intermission acts(My name is Jonas, No one Else, Surf Wax America) these songs carry the style, and relieve you just after hearing a hit. <br /> <br />What can you ask for a hit album?  I don't know, maybe a few catchy hits and some good songs!  Weezer answered this by creating great loud guitar melodys, and great lyrics.  Thank you Rivers Cuomo!!!! <br /> <br />When I hear this album, I am in a state of shock, untill the last song.  Only In Dreams is the greatest song to end your album in.  Getting all hyped up, and then relieving yourself with a slow song to end the album <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

Featuring Zhang Ziyi, from 2000's cinematic chart-topper Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Road Home is the story of a girl who falls in love with a schoolteacher.  One of the most tear-jerking parts is when she drops the bowl of dumplings that she'd made for him, and the bowl breaks; tears are guaranteed to stream like creeks.  Simply lovely.

0670033375|5.0|Jared Diamond takes the large view. This was obvious in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel, where Diamond cast aside long-standing beliefs of cultural superiority with in-depth research and great storytelling to create an argument that even the most conservative and belligerent couldn't refute.<br /><br />With Collapse, Diamond takes the large view again to explain how and why societies collapse (in some cases, societal implosion might be an even better description). Those of us who understand natural science and ecosystems are already onboard with the causes of collapse, but it is often (if not always) difficult to make a case that many elements of our society will accept. Diamond is brilliant: one of his early chapters discusses the mystery of Easter Island, and who isn't fascinated by a good mystery? He moves on to the Vikings in America and Greenland; again, a topic bound to entrance even the most conservative reader. Going forward, he discusses the Maya and the Anasazi, and then he springs his trap: most of the second half of the book deals with environmentalism and sustainability. Among the greatest causes of societal collapse are deforestation, resource depletion, pollution, the availability of fresh water, and soil salinity-all of the bad things that environmentalists have been warning us about since Rachel Carson had the courage to step up in the fifties and sixties.<br /><br />Some societies did collapse because of warfare and strife, but more often than not, societies collapsed because of environmental degradation or violence that resulted from environmental degradation. As the reader learns about Easter Islanders, Vikings, and Anasazi, Diamond weaves in the environmental impacts that led to the demise of these cultures; the conservative is lured in until denial is no longer an adequate response. Collapse may be a book that can finally sway anti-environmentalists into some kind of positive action; they may at least sell their SUVs or try to recycle something. Collapse is not a gloom & doom genre book. Diamond avoids the trap of trying to predict an uncertain future; he simply reports accurately what has happened in the past, and applies what is learned to the present. Collapse is both a great historical book and an important environmental book.hing. Collapse is not a gloom & doom genre book.

True, in a way, but..uh...I dunno...I just like listening to this track! <br /> <br />Kid A: 10/10 <br /> <br />This song is amazing. It's a dark, twisted, ominous little storybook, yet it is somewhat comforting at times. Very creative vocals shine in this song, if you can make them out. \\"We've got heads on sticks, we've got ventriloquists\\" THe song starts to distinegrate as the vocal mutters \\"Rats and children follow me out of town...Come on Kids\\" <br /> <br />THe National Anthem-9/10 <br /> <br />This is one of the most 'normal' tracks on the record. It's booming, \\"anthem\\"-like guitar, bass and drums until a bombardment of horns and trumpets mutilate your eardrums. A great track. <br /> <br /> <br />How To Disappear Completely-8.5/10 <br /> <br />A somewhat weaker track, but it is quite claustrophobic and downright gorgeous at times, especially near the end. The soft, seemingly far-away twelve-string acoustic guitar works well. <br /> <br />Treefingers-7/10 <br /> <br />A calm, mystifying instrumental of whatever instrument. Yet, it's just...weak. I dunno, I just can't really sit through it...Bring on the next track! <br /> <br />Optimistic-10/10 <br /> <br />A storm of tribal drumming, fast, sharp electric guitar and Thom Yorke chanting \\"Ooooh oooh ooh\\" kicks off one of the best tracks on this album. This song's title is ironic: it's chock full of lyrics like \\"Vultures spinning round my head\\" and \\"Big fish eat the little one\\". It's an exceptionally fantastic track, though, and one of Radiohead's Top 20 songs ever. <br /> <br /> <br />In Limbo-8/10 <br /> <br />This is a hypnotic track with icy keyboards, Thom's swirling vocals and just a sonic sea of instuments. A great track, but nobody seems to like it. <br /> <br /> <br />Idioteque-10/10 <br /> <br />One of Radiohead's finest songs. It's deliberately a cheesy dance song, but it's like commands to fleeing survivors of an apocalyptic scene. Thom's vocals are awesome; commanding and pleading at the same time. \\"We're not scaremongering...this is really happening\\", wails Thom. <br /> <br />Morning Bell- 9/10 <br /> <br />A very 'human' song, but it's violent and desperate. It's melodic, georgeous, and just great, but look for this song's reprise on Amnesiac. I actually find it better on that album. It's more haunting, ominous, brooding, and layered than its predeccesor. Plus it's shortened by a lot. <br /> <br /> <br />Motion Picture Soundtrack-10/10 <br /> <br />What a way to end this amazing album. Old fashioned organ chimes in, with pulsing harp. It's already beautiful, but my breath was taken away at the end of this masterpiece, where Thom says quietly, \\"I will see you in the next life\\". The song then rises into the air and fades away, for about three minutes. Then the song comes roaring back. That's one of this album's many little secrets and surprises. and the climax of the album. <br /> <br />If you are thinking of buying this, buy it now. Prepare to enter a parallel reality with this wonderful band and this majestic, artistic masterpiece of an album: Kid A. <br /> <br />Oh, and get OK Computer, The Bends... well, you know the drill.
B00002SSKI|4.0|ah now and then, the film of so many girly sleepovers. my friends and i would actually discuss which one of us would be which character(i always picked roberta and was very disappointed that she got so fat)if u have young daughters then they will love this film and it certainly did form an important part of my childhood.a girls version of stand by me (only of course not quite so amazing)its funny, moving and inspiring
0062515675|2.0|Julian works himself to a heart attack, goes to Himalayas, comes back in robes with a \\"supple skin\\", and starts lecturing on how to improve life.<br /><br />I could not relate to the fable. The author's writing style is too synthetic. I'd any day recommend The Alchemist.
B0000039PW|5.0|Now this is a classic album, one of the best rap cds eva, here is wat i thought of it <br /> <br />Intro: Not bad for an intro, it goes through the years wiv different old rap/Hip Hop beats, ending wiv Biggie getting out of jail saying he aint goin back and he has big plans. 3/5 <br /> <br />Things Done Changed: Beat is great and lyrically great as well, rapping about how times in the hood were good at one time until everybody started killing each other. 5/5 <br /> <br />Gimmie The Loot: One of my favourites of Biggies, complete hardcore or gangsta wateva u wanna call it, Biggie does two voices here (being 2 friends) Bigs storytelling here is great and his flow is amazing, love the beat as well and the lyrics are brilliant. 5/5 <br /> <br />Machine Gun Funk: Another top quality track wiv a great beat and again lyrics are good as always, one of my favourite lines in this song is  'The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya  <br />High as a motherf**kin helicopter  <br />That's why I pack a nina, f*ck a misdeameanor  <br />Beatin motherf**kers like Ike beat Tina  <br />[What's Love, Got to Do] now that is a fresh line. 5/5 <br /> <br />Warning: This track is about Biggie getting a call from a friend about some people coming to get him to kill him for his money, beat is good and lyrics are good as well. 5/5 <br /> <br />Ready To Die: Biggie is hungry here, hardcore lyrics and another good beat, anotha album highlight. 5/5 <br /> <br />One More Chance: Bigs flow here is great, song about all the girls wanting more of Biggie, nice female hook, beat is good and so are lyrics. 5/5 <br /> <br />F**k Me: Just an horrible interlude of Biggie banging some girl. 1/5 <br /> <br />The What: Method Man and Biggie = Tight Flows and lyrics, great song. 5/5 <br /> <br />Juicy: One of the albums singles, this song is a classic, great beat and lyrics, great female hook, u must of heard this one. 5/5 <br /> <br />Everyday Struggle: I love the beat on this one, biggie rapping about lifes struggles. 5/5 <br /> <br />Me And My Bitch: Biggie rapping about Faith Evans i guess, not bad has its moments: 4/5 <br /> <br />Big Poppa: Chillout time, this was another single i think. great song, good to chill to. 5/5 <br /> <br />Respect: Great beat and lyrics, hes rapping about his life from in the womb, kid and adult. another great song. 5/5 <br /> <br />Friend Of Mine:I really like the beat and lyrics are ok, but i wud say it is the worst song after the interlude, but its still good, not a skip track by any means. 3/5 <br /> <br />Unbelievable: I think this was done before Big was signed to a professional label, good lyrically, but beat is not to great. 4/5 <br /> <br />Suicidal Thoughts: Big ringing up Puffy i think telling him all his problems, good dark beat and nasty lyrics, ending wiv Biggie shooting himself. 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall: A classic album, one of my favourite rap albums eva, u need this if u havent got it, i wish Big was still around showing all these fools today how to do things. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|2.0|This movie is extremely boring.  I was literally waiting for the movie to end.  Unfortunately, there are many naive people who are claiming that the movie is accurate or truthful. The movie basically portrays the typical ideas that Christians attribute to Jesus, even though every historian (even ones with a Christian background) claim that a significant amount attributed to Jesus by Christians is conjecture. <br /> <br />This movie is based on books (the New Testament) written decades after Jesus left by unknown authors who never even witnessed what happened!  Not only do the accounts in these books contradict one another if you study them closely, but they make no logical sense.  For example, why would God need to have an innocent man's blood poured before being able to forgive?  (By the way, that man is also assumed to be God's son, who also happens to be God, because that's the only way some people can claim they are monotheists even though they worship more than one being).  Also, if believing that Jesus died for our sins is the purpose of our existence, then why did God even give us the ability to think and make moral choices if all he cares about is the \\"pure sacrifice\\" of an innocent man? It's a great fairy tale to make people think they won't be held accountable for making immoral decisions rather than emphasizing the need to grow or learn from their mistakes.  Don't watch this movie unless you want to get confused.
6300247120|5.0|This IS a great movie.  Great for characterizations, story, acting, faithfulness to the location and time.  And boy, does it give you a good feeling!  Does it have a happy ending?  Check it out!
B00004YB9Y|5.0|The Three Tenors are, of course, wonderful to listen to.  This is also a funny CD.  When they sing the more modern songs (Happy Christmas by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, for example) they have trouble keeping up with the pace of the song.  They almost sound like they're tripping over the syllables, because as opera singers they are more accustomed to long, drawn out vowels, not fast ones.  This doesn't hurt the song at all, it makes it more interesting to listen to.  It's a great CD.  I would recommend this as an addition to any collection of Christmas music.
B00005MCX2|5.0|The bad things first.  Yes, it is a bit overlong, and yes, some of the spoken poems are a bit insipid.  Having said that, this cd contains some of the best live music I've ever heard. <br /> <br />     The heart of the cd is the old (side 2 + 3) from the original album - that is, from \\"Lord of Light\\" to \\"Brainstorm\\".  \\"The Black Corridor\\" is one of the spoken poems that actually works.  You then get 8+ minutes of a monster song \\"Space is Deep\\" that is truly amazing - music so thick and nuanced that it could be sliced with a knife. <br /> <br />     After some electronic noodling comes \\"Orgone Accumulator\\".  You don't need to know what an orgone accumulator is to enjoy (though it doesn't hurt - try googling for it).  \\"Upside Down\\" is fairly forgettable, but then comes another halfway decent poem \\"10 Seconds to Forever\\" and then, what may be one of the best live songs ever (any genre any musician).  \\"Brainstorm\\" is one of those songs that you can listen to again and again - the lyrics don't mean much (though they set an interesting vibe) but the music...o the music.  This is a song that deserves to be played as loud as you can get away with. <br /> <br />     As for the rest of the cd...well, some interesting bits and some embarrassing bits (\\"Sonic Attack\\" in particular is outstanding in a bad movie sort of way).  But who cares.  Edit it down to 40-50 minutes and you have something to enjoy again and again.  Hard to believe this came out five years after the beatles broke up...hard to believe hawkwind never became more than a cult success.  Get it and enjoy!
B00006AL1G|5.0|Saw it in the theater and it damn near killed me it was so good.  <br /> <br />Even if you're not into hiphop, this is a fun, informative, and very direct peek into the world of DJ's through the eyes of it's originators and innovators. Some amazing interview clips, especially Mix Master Mike, QBert, and DJ Shadow. Shadow's section in particular gives some well articulated notions about the nature of using other people's records (often obscure) within a DJ's set. If you don't think \\"turntablism\\" is a valid musical expression, you will after this movie. <br /> <br />The only complaints I have about this movie is its lack of female DJ's (the movie has one, and she learned from her boyfriend and works with him) even though there are thousands, and the lack of representation of DJ culture beyond hiphop (the use of DJs with Portishead and other downtempo groups). They do have a quick segment on Japanese DJ Krush who creates beautiful grooves using slow hiphop rhythms with traditional Japanese music. I would have liked to have seen more Ninja Tune artists, but that's just personal bias. <br /> <br />All in all, this is an amazing history of the scratch through the voices of those who lived and are living it. It's amazing that almost all of these people, like myself, had a life-changing moment when they first heard the scratching in Herbie Hancock's \\"Rocket\\" on the same tv performance. <br />
B0002IVN9W|3.0|This album is good, yes.  But it's not exactly the greatest thing ever.  These guys have been getting a ton of press from every indie forum and site on the planet.  It's really unnecessary. <br />This album really wasn't made to be marketed to general audiences.  But this album is now being heard by a ton of people that I couldn't have imagined listening to The Arcade Fire.  Ok?  I heard about these guys in September of last year.  I'm one of those people against small bands blowing up.  I don't think it'll ruin them; it's just not going to be as special and personal to listen to them anymore. <br />I don't think these guys are one hit wonders, because they're not now.  They're just a band that's at the focus of many people.  They're probably going to be another Interpol.  Watch.  They're record another album that'll be most likely better than this one in the next year, but everyone will say it's a disappointment.  But it really won't be. <br /> <br />Well, it's worth buying.  Favorites on the album include Neighborhood #1,#2,#3, Wake Up, and Rebellion (Lies).
B00004T9UF|1.0|I generally avoid rap but i hear some friends talking about m.m.lp and one of them let me borrow it... it is nothing special, in fact it is the worst music i ever dared to listen to... i do not think it can be called music at all... and his lyrics are not \\"inspiring\\" or \\"creative\\" they sound like a 4th grader made them... if you want to listen to intellectual music pick up some pink floyd... if you wanna listen to some guy spewing cuss words and pointing out obvious facts, listen to eminem....
B0000214F1|5.0|This film is a piece of art in it's best form. It's as close to our knowledge of Roman life as possible, so it definitly has deep and solid historic foundation. So don't rush to blame the authors for making stuff up! The actors play is also amazing. It touches you deep at different levels, just how true art is supposed to do.<br /><br />Of course, you've probably heard about the shameless porn scenes. Well, it's true and not true. There are a lot of sex acts but I wouldn't call it a porn movie. Yes, if naked bodies shock you, don't try to watch it. But it's not about sex. There is a much bigger message.<br /><br />The Roman life 2000 years ago in many aspects was very similar to our life now. And sometimes we think we can understand those people. But then some striking differences pop up. And it's quite an experience to try to compare life then and now. What is similar and what is different? Are the people the same as they used to be? What moral principles have changed for 2000 years? Where are the limits of democracy?<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0002KVUKM|4.0|This is a terrible movie. Why in the hell am I giving it 4 stars? Well, without this, we wouldn't have the classic movies it stole from in nifty Legacy editions.

B0002858YS|5.0|The Killers' Hot Fuss cd is the best cd I own right now. I love every song on it and I could honestly listen to it for hours on end...I have before. But it! It is defintiely worth the price, which isn't very much. My personal favorites are \\"Mr. Brightside\\", \\"Andy, you're a star\\", \\"On Top\\" and \\"Midnight Show\\".<br /><br />Buy the cd NOW!
B0007P3582|1.0|don't get this cd. it's a waste of money. His first cd dominates this one. Get a actual good cd like lil wayne- tha carter or Do or Die-DOD
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|The relationship between a young man and his dying father takes center stage at this original movie, that seamlessly mixtures fantasy and reality in order to create a film well-worth watching.<br /><br />The son, William (Billy Crudup), wants to know more about his dad before it is too late, but is fed up with the incredible stories he always tell about himself. The problem is that his father, Edward (Albert Finney), cannot help but talk a lot and make reality more interesting, disguising it as he deems necessary. But after telling a story many times, it becomes real to you, and Ed can't distinguish truth from lies any more. But who knows, maybe he doesn't want to...<br /><br />The talks and fights between father and son, mixed with their interaction with their wives, take them down memory lane, as Ed remembers once again what happened to him from the moment he left his little town as a young man. Ed doesn't stop telling tall tales, but the spectator will be happy for that due to the fact that thanks to the skill of the director of \\"Big Fish\\" (Tim Burton) Ed's stories come alive, and we are introduced to witches, giants, werewolves, the biggest fish in the river and even to the charmed town that young Ed (Ewan Mc Gregor) visited in his wandering days. We also get to know how Ed met the girl he knew would become his wife (Alison Lohman, afterwards played by Jessica Lange), and the unconventional way in which he proposed to her.<br /><br />Those stories are too strange to be truthful, of course, and that is the problem for Will. But soon enough he will realise that maybe not all Ed's stories are complete lies, and that he might know his father much more than he was aware of.<br /><br />I highly enjoyed this movie, even though it made me cry a little at the end. I want to point out that the general tone is one of optimism, and that \\"Big Fish\\" is so visually engaging that you will believe you are living an extraordinary fairy tale. And what can I say?. I love good fairy tales!!!<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B00008K7AM|5.0|<br />The Hot Chick is one heck of a funny movie!  The main plot is this preppy girl and this scum bag man switch bodies, such as a Freaky Friday effect, and he causes lots of mayhem while she gets into a lot of humor along the way.  It was a well cast movie and the comedy is great you will be laughing the whole movie!  I love this movie and it is a favorite in my collection of movies.   <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|What can I say, short and simple, if  your tired of the same old \\"alternative\\" sound, (Green Day, the Killers, Sublime, 311, Pearl Jam, Blink 182, No Doubt, Jimmy Eat World, etc.), you know, the same old same old you hear on every \\"alternative\\" radio staion in the US.) The Arcade Fire is your band.  No they probably wont be played on a commercial station, but thats only because they are DIFFERENT.  Not the same old boreing oatmeal.  If you are the kind of person who NEEDS something differnt to listen to but want it to still sound good.  This is your band.  To me its one of those cd's that grabbed me the very first time around.  Its like nothing I've heard before.  At the risk of hyping this CD up too much, all I can say is get this CD, you wont be dissapointed!
B0002KQNL8|3.0|This sequel to 'The Return of the Living Dead' is about a canister of 2-4-5 Trioxin accidentally falling out of a truck and being carried away by water into one of the sewers in a near-by town. A group of neighbourhood kids' curiousity gets the better of them and they open it, unleashing a deadly green gas which finds its way into the town cemetary, bringing back a horde of hungry brain-eating zombies. The main characters find themselves in thier evacuated town, left alone to battle the living dead. Now our remaining heros must find a way to combat the zombies, or have thier brains eaten by them. <br /> <br />This movie was okay, not horrible, but not good. It's kind of a re-make of the much better first installment. What I didn't like about this DVD is that for some odd reason they changed the soundtrack. I heard about this before I bought it and didn't think it could be as bad as everyone made it out to be, boy was I wrong! it was so horrible I had to skip that part. The good news is that the orginal score can be found on the french track, and if your timing is right you can avoid the pain of having to listen to the new score.  <br />Two characters from the first movie, Frank and Freddy (now re-named Edd and Joey) return to play totally different characters. It's a little strange that our main hero is a litte boy (who manages to escape the sewer before the bullys unleash the Trioxen) although he was a likeable character. The thing which I hated most about this movie was Edd and Joeys' zombie make-up. In the first one the more sick they became from the Trioxin, the more horrible they looked. In the first movie they had horribly white skin and very dark brown skin around thier eyes giving them a very horrifying, sick, zombie-look. But in this one thier make-up sucked, thier skin was still tanned and normal looking! I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't even have make-up. That's something they really screwed up, the sick-looking make-up. <br />What I did like aboutthis movie was that this time around the Trioxin gas was a dark green instead of clear like the first one, giving it a more deadly and dangerous look. <br />The acting was good from most of the cast, except the main bully, he's a kid who needs acting lessons. <br />Overall, the move had to much things that screwed it up, it was nowhere near as good as the first or the third. <br />I say just skip this one and watched the third.
0790729628|4.0|Blade Runner is a good movie. It's interesting and different. The set design is really good. Especially near the end of the movie. <br /> <br />The actual director's cut is a little too slow at times. Without the commentary, parts of the movie are a little boring as people do stuff you don't care about. With the commentary by Harrison Ford, you don't really pay attention to that stuff. <br /> <br />It's a good movie, but wait for a better edition.
B0007P3582|4.0|the massacre from 50 cent is as good as his first album. which exceeded well, with most of the songs that is on this cd. so if you like 50 cents first album, you will love this one.

B0007NFL18|4.0|im seeing that a lot of people are dissin this album and saying that 50 is just an average rapper...these people must be on drugs because this album is hot...50 took a cd that was full of beats and picked the ones he liked without knowing who they were from, showing he cares about quality rather than street credability...this CD is hot and will sell more records than get rich or die trying did...and for those that say 50 is an average lyricist should listen to his 1st album...im not talking about get rich or die trying either, if ur a real rap fan ull know what im talking about...definitely buy this cd if ur looking for something to kick back and chill to <br /> <br />hot joints: a baltimore love thing, ski mask way, piggy bank and get in my car to name a few
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|If you are a fan of extremely good music in general you should definitely check out this album.  Behind all the eyeliner, this band has some major talent.  You can't judge a band by their appearance, just as you can't judge a book by its cover. It's the music that's important here people, and I can't help but think that Avenged Sevenfold would get lots more respect if they changed their wardrobe, which is seriously lame.    Anyway, moving onward. \\"Waking the Fallen\\" is one of the most unique albums you'll ever own.  This band has had many influences, both old school metal and punk, so you can't really label this album into a certain genre. In my opinion it's a combination of all types of music.  There's a little bit of hardcore, punk, metal, goth, rock and even pop mixed into this album, which surprizingly doesn't come out as sounding cheesy. This album takes you into a world of fierce growling, clean vocals, incredible guitar work, light pianos and extremely musical melodies.  It definitely takes a band with lots of infulences to create an album this unique.    I would recommend this album to anyone. Perhaps if you're into lighter metal combined with slight punky-sounding choruses, you should give this album a try. While it's not extremely heavy, even some fans of metal might enjoy this, because of the bands old school influences.    Overall this is an extremely musical album for those who aren't so close-minded when it comes to music.
B00063F8B2|5.0|Fantastic soundtrack to a truly magical movie!  My favorite is \\"When Christmas comes to town\\"  but all the songs are great, from the old to the new, definately gives you that warm and fuzzy Christmas feeling!
B000002UAU|5.0|How good is this album let me count the ways. Words like masterpiece classic genius are usually used when descibing this album I would throw in timeless,sublime,mystical & surreal. When it comes to the greatest music of all time you have beethoven bach radiohead and the beatles at the top. You can safely place this album alongside ok computer as the greatest musical achievment of our time. A beautiful piece of music that will echo down through the ages. <br /> <br />Peace. <br />
B00005JMUL|5.0|I had many reservations about this movie, having been a fan of the book for so long.  Most movies don't come close to the book they portray, but this one did.  What a fantastic, magical experience.   It brought me back to when I was little and made me believe in the magic all over again, and experience that with my 7 year old son.  The book brings tears to my eyes, and so did this movie, just amazing!   On a side note, we saw it on both the regular screen and the IMAX 3-D screen.   If you ever get the chance again to see it on the IMAX screen, do it, it is well worth it!  the regular screen just cannot compare.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Talk about a TV sitcom show regarded as one of the best ever (or even the best ever). Add to it a DVD box set full, I mean, really FULL of extras and information, and you have in your hands the perfect set. The SEINFELD's seasons released in DVD up until should make the FRIENDS sets feel ashamed, because SEINFELD, like FRIENDS, would sell a lot even without all the extras. But Larry David and jerry Seinfeld proved how they care about their fans, and released the DVD's only after they found it to be a really singular product. The Warner people responsible for FRIENDS didn't cara a little: there is not ONE SINGLE INTERVIEW with any of the enesemble cast!! There is not ONE SINGLE COMMENTARY TRACK with any of the ensemble cast!!<br /><br />As for the episodes, we all know that SEINFELD began to find its mark in Season Three, but we all also know that the seeds of its future success were already plainly visible in Seasons 1 and 2.
0790731452|5.0|O yeah I agree that this is a pretty decent flick, but, if the writer that wrote was a just a little more on the ball, he would have realized that the alien situation could have been better handled with something more powerful than mindblowing music. One Name...Two syllables... RIC FLAIR <br /> <br />All's the President would of had to do is get The Nature Boy on the phone, give him the situation, and watch. I'm sure Ric would be pretty mad leaving all his ladies but if the Prez just gives him a hefty bonus for saving the Earth, I'm sure he'd be up for it.  <br /> <br />The aliens wouldn't have a chance. There would be chops, figure fours, and 450 splashes all over the place. The aliens that aren't getting the glop kicked out of them, would surely be running back to their space ship. Then they would blast off into outer space to go and tell other extra-terrestrials not to even bother with the planet named Earth.   <br /> <br />I give Eberts review on this movie    0 Stars
B0002OERI0|4.0|This is the first Green Day album I have listened to in any depth since Dookie. I am not sure if I have been missing out, but American Idiot would certainly suggest that I have. I had heard nothing but good things about this album and it was time I found out for myself if they were true. <br /> <br />I will admit now that this review is a bit overdue as I have been listening to the album for a few weeks. I really enjoy it. Green Day takes a pretty interesting political and social stance that you do not generally see in mainstream music. My favorite tracks off of the album are #2 \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and #3 \\"Holiday\\".  <br /> <br />A pretty interesting piece of gossip is that there will be a movie deal for Green Day associated with this album. That would be pretty exciting for the boys in the band I am sure. That on top of winning the Grammy for Best Rock Album in 2004 should make them pretty proud of American Idiot. Check it out.
B00000I5Y6|3.0|This album suffers from the same problem that plagues many \\"best of\\" compilations. That is, it is a mix of the band's truly great songs, such as \\"Song for America\\" and \\"The Wall\\", and the decent-to-bland songs that got the band some attention on the radio for a while and were then forgotten, such as \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Play the Game Tonight\\". Better CDs are their \\"Song for America\\" and \\"Leftoverture\\" albums, two great musical compilations which display the amazing musical creativity of which Kansas was capable.
0385486804|4.0|read Into the Wild for the first time over four years ago after I had read Into Thin Air (also by author Jon Krakauer). <br /> <br />The argument has been made that having read the blurb on the back cover of the book (listed above) that there is now no reason to read Into the Wild in its entirety. What more could they tell you? You know how the story ends, don't you? Christopher Johnson McCandless died at the end of his journey. What you do not know is how he got from Emory University in Atlanta, GA to Alaska. The synopsis above does not tell you how many lives he touched, and how deeply, along the way. <br /> <br />Chris McCandless, or \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" to a few, was not the first to bid farewell to society and try his hand at living off the land, being at one with nature. He is, however, arguably the most unique individual to do so. Krakauer has pursued extensive interviews with not only Chris' family, but also friends who met him on the road and know him only as \\"Alex\\". <br /> <br />How deeply do you think you can be touched by a hitchhiker as you drive him a few hundred miles down the road? Did you ever think you would wish he would not get out of the car when it comes time? I am not sure the people who did Chris a favor ever thought they would either, however in their accounts they try to put into words what was so special about this particular young man. <br /> <br />Chris was a very gifted athlete. He was an above average student throughout his entire academic career at one point with aspirations of Harvard Law and the grades to match. He had an entrepreneurial spirit that had made him a good deal of money and earned him a lot of respect growing up. <br /> <br />Why would someone with this background give it all up and walk into the woods? Jon Krakauer takes us along the path to California, South Dakota, into Mexico, eventually to Alaska and many places in between to find out. <br /> <br />The author seems to approach this book as if he were trying to solve the mystery of Chris' death and in essence he was doing just that. He really tells us why Chris was unable to survive his journey and in the process we find out why he began the journey in the first place. The depth of the research is remarkable. Krakauer in this, and all of his books, really goes the extra mile to talk to anyone and everyone involved and find out as many details as possible. I have the highest level of respect for the work that Jon Krakauer does for his books. <br /> <br />In the Acknowledgements section at the end, the author thanks those he interviewed for helping him put the book together. If you read this book I am sure you will, like I do, want to thank them as well. Less than a year has passed from the time you find out a loved one has passed away; a loved one about whom you have worried everyday since he last contacted you which was two years ago. Along comes a journalist who wants to get to know him through you. How forthcoming would you...or could you be? <br /> <br />If you like this, another Krakauer book I cannot recommend enough is Under the Banner of Heaven.

B0007O38F8|5.0|These low reviews I see are ridiculous and insulting... some people just give a low rating because they like The Game better? That's a joke and a sad reflection on the influence of biases in the critic circle. Anyway, this CD had an enormous ammount of hype behind it and somehow 50 was able to focus and turn out a product worthy of being the follow up to Get Rich or Die Tryin', which to me was one of the finest (if not the finest) rap album that's been released since Chronic 2001.  <br />  The most interesting part about The Massacre is the varing styles on it. 50 has tracks from a variety of producers and it shows. 50 also showcases his vocal abilities as he is constantly changing his tone and style depending on the beat (which 50 even points out at one point). The west coast beats to \\"Gunz Come Out\\" remind the listener at once to the glory days of the Death Row artists as well as Dre's Aftermath west coast style.  <br />   50 put out an amazing 22 tracks, far and above what he could have done and the effort is appreciated. None of the tracks feel like they were added just to fill time, each one is carefully thought out and the lyrics are incredibly creative. I read that 50 actually recorded upwards of 60 tracks for this cd which I really respect. <br />  All in all this is the best album of the year so far and is a shining beacon in a sea of mediocre music. It's refreshing to hear an artist who simply isn't coasting on his reputation and instead is trying to build upon his already giant reputation. If you even remotely liked Get Rich or Die Tryin', run out and purchase The Massacre, you will not be disappointed. 5 out of 5.
6302737168|5.0|This is one excellent live concert. This is one of the best live concerts ever captured on video. It is about 2 hours of live concert and about 1/2 hour of behind the scenes footage. The total playing time is 155 minutes. The VHS stereo video has excellent sound and video quality. The camera angles used to video tape the concert are the best I have ever seen in any live concert. In addition, the concert also includes some excellent video presentations that were shown at the live concert along with the live music. The songs include:<br /><br />Land Of Confusion<br /><br />No Son Of Mine<br /><br />Driving The Last Spike<br /><br />Old Medley<br /><br />Fading Lights<br /><br />Jesus He Knows Me<br /><br />Dreaming While You Sleep<br /><br />Home By The Sea<br /><br />Hold On My Heart<br /><br />Domino<br /><br />I Can't Dance<br /><br />Tonight, Tonight, Tonight<br /><br />Invisable Touch<br /><br />Turn It On Again<br /><br />This video was released in 1993.
B0007O38F8|5.0|I gave him a 5 because he doesn't deserve a 1. <br />GRODT is another cd. A lot of people must be want part 2 or something to come out. This cd is the Massacre where you will have new songs and lyrics. There are at least 10 good songs on this album. From 2004-2005 besides Kanye who else has at least 10 good songs. <br />Here is a list of some of my favorites: <br /> <br />I'M Supposed To Die Tonight <br />Piggy Bank <br />Candy Shop <br />Outta Control <br />Get In My Car <br />A Baltimore Love Thing <br />Ryder Music <br />Disco Inferno <br />Just A Lil Bit <br />My Toy soldier <br />God Gave My Style <br />So Amazing <br />Hate It Or Love It Remix
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer is by far one the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Not only is the cast top notch, but the storyline is what makes the movie stand out the most.  Closer gives the audience a harsh and realistic look into the relationships of the 4 characters.  The movie isn't sugar coated, but isn't overly dramatic.  Definitely a must see for someone looking for something other than a romantic comedy, and wanting to see a movie about REAL relationships and how they can mend and fall apart.
B0007P3582|1.0|I was looking forward to the release of this album, and am somewhat surprised at the content.  This is sub-par, weak, vacuous music. <br /> <br />A replay confirmed the opinion I formed after an initial listen, that each track is seemingly worse than the last.  The thought running through my mind was 'what is this junk..?'  The tracks are meaningless and bungled.  The array of producers leads to a disjointed product offering, and other than waxing lyrical about his wide array of weaponry, 50 appears to have nothing to say.  Certainly nothing meaningful or interesting. <br /> <br />I felt that the two singles 'Candy Store' and 'Disco Infernal' were little more than commercial pap.  'Without me' by Eminem, though flogged to death to an equal degree holds out as a better track by miles. <br /> <br />For me, the best track on the album is 'GATman and Robbin,' and that is purely due to the verses dropped by Eminem.  Fairly sad if you think that the best thing on this album is yet again a guest appearance, which if released on a true Eminem album would be skipped through anyway. <br /> <br />The Game's album is infinitely superior to this album, and comparisons to 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'' are pointless - might as well be different artists. <br /> <br />Not worth the wait, sadly..

B00003CXCT|3.0|I have the 1997 VHS trilogy , seeing it I really disliked the CGI they put in , it stands out , doesn't look like part of the movie and really redundent and I'm not picky about chaning a line here and there or who shoots who first . <br /> <br />Then I saw the PM , it was so bad that I didn't bother to see the new ones , they really should have left it at the trilogy , The new movies are no better then the average summer movie crap just with a starwars logo . <br /> <br />Anyone with a bit of sense will see its a merchendise machine , all the CGI , characthers , locations , action , dumb slapstic jokes etc. are made to appeal to kids and milk money out of it , any story , plot acting come in last . <br /> <br />Mr. Lucas , for what ever $$$ you want please put the orignals on dvd , double the money it if you burn the new versions in the process .
B000002UTO|5.0|I was a die-hard Duranie in the 80s, but felt like I got ripped off when I plunked down money for Pop Trash and Medazzaland.  I picked up Big Thing in a used CD store and felt like I had stumbled across undiscovered treasure.  Very mellow, more like Arcadia's So Red the Rose than Astronaut (or even the wedding album).  Like the other reviewers mentioned, Edge of America, Palomino, and Too Late Marlene are haunting, beautiful tracks. It's one of my favorite CDs to listen to at work---quiet enough to not be distracting, yet interesting and anything but bland.
0790729601|5.0|that's what I said to myself the first time I saw this on vhs. moving, funny, powerful, packed with enough action to saw open a can of worms. it's that powerful. saw it 3 times on tv. better and better it is every time I see it. this movie may be from the 90's but it will stay an action classic for the next 100 years. I\\"m serious. if you like Arnold then see Kindergarten Cop. his role as the teacher and good guy cop is hilarious and awesome. not to mention the kids are adorable, funny and very interesting with each one of their personalities. I love this movie Eraser. it's an interesting plot. keeps you hooked from start to end. and really is amazing overall. the direction and director are (is) genious. keep up the great work Arnold. I can see you making movies til you're about 88 or 98. you have a healthy body too so you will live a long long time. and hopefully a happy life with your beautiful and devoted wife Maria Shriver. I think that's how you spell her name. thanks for your time fellow movie watchers. <br />and I'm so glad I saw this and have it on dvd. I'll watch it again and again and still feel the thrills and action
B0000013G9|5.0|TLC is one of the roots behind other female R&B groups in the business today such as Destiny's Child, Blaque, JS, Floetry, and others. Without TLC, female R&B groups would have nothing to model off of. The Sexy T-Boz, Crazy Left Eye (RIP), and Cool Chilli give all they've got. I love T-Boz's voice throughout the album. She has a sexy, deeper voice for a female which is kind of an aphrodisiac and sets the mood for much of the album (about 70%). Chilli's soft, sweet vocals are also shown on the album. I love the way she can hit those high notes that others can't. She dominates, about 30%, of the album while our crazy girl Left Eye is left with the hooks of some songs. Being the only rapper in an R&B group is pretty tough but Left Eye keeps that slick flow. Every song on this album is a hit! <br /> <br />1. Intro-Lude (10/10) - A hip, sexy way to start the album off with a little rap from some no-name guy. <br /> <br />2. Creep (10/10) - A nice, upbeat song about creeping on their man. The lyrics were very well written. <br /> <br />3. Kick Your Game (10/10) - This song definitely proves that this is a 90s album. It has the feel of a 90s song but it's flow never gets old and it always sounds fresh each time you hear it. I can't help but bop my head to it. <br /> <br />4. Diggin' On You (7/10) - Slowing the album down, TLC let Chilli & T-Boz croon to their male fans out there. The song is kind of boring if you ask me but it isn't terrible. Far from terrible. <br /> <br />5. Case of the Fake People (10/10) - One of my favorite tracks on the album. The song is basically talking about people that you think you know but you actually have no idea about them. They come off as something they aren't. This is a good song for the haters in your life. <br /> <br />6. CrazySexyCool [Interlude] (5/10) - Just an interlude with T-Boz talking about the definition of a woman who is CrazySexyCool. <br /> <br />7. Red Light Special (9/10) - A nice cool off after the upbeat \\"Case of the Fake People\\". I absolutely love this song. <br /> <br />8. Waterfalls (10/10) - One of the greatest songs ever recorded by TLC. This song is the song that rose them to stardom. This song not only has a positive message, but uses that message to a hot beat. <br /> <br />10. Intermission-Lude - It's just music from the intro. <br /> <br />11. Let's Do It Again (6/10) - I'm not crazy about this song but it is far from being an album filler. <br /> <br />12. If I Was Your Girlfriend (10/10) - Yet another hit! This song is great. Enough said. <br /> <br />13. Sexy [Interlude] (10/10) - Oh my god! This interlude cracks me up. I never get enough of it. It never gets old! It's so damn funny. Lets just say Chilli calls up some guy (I think it's P.Diddy) and she asks him to help her do something. (Flush) <br /> <br />14. Take Our Time (10/10) - My overall FAVORITE song on the whole album! It's so sexy and cool at the same time. It's probably one of the slowest songs on the album but it sure is amazing. Chilli sure knows how to sing to the fellas because she has got me wanting to take my time. <br /> <br />15. Can I Get a Witness [Interlude] (5/10) - Random interlude with Left Eye and Busta Rhymes. This is one of the few times you see Left Eye featured on a track. Poor Left :(. <br /> <br />16. Switch (8/10) - Nothing to scream about but it's pretty good. <br /> <br />17. Sumthin' Wicked This Way Comes (featuring Outkast) (10/10) - A deep and positive song about people and the ways of the world today. Andr sure has a way with making songs with positive messages. I love this song. <br /> <br />Overall Grade : A-
6305252521|5.0|the only thing I can say is that phrase I heard somewhere <br /> <br />is life imitating us? <br />or are we imitating it? <br /> <br />absolutely funny and touching movie <br />saw it 3 times on vhs <br />and have it now on dvd <br />if you like Jim Carrey <br /> <br />then see Man on the moon: he does a great impersonation of the great and deceased but not forgotten Andy Kaufman <br />he's also great in Batman Forever as the insane but hilarious Riddler <br />and breathtaking side humors in Ace Ventura movies of his <br /> <br />this Truman show movie will touch me more and more every time I watch it <br />I hope it does too for you <br /> <br />

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie, by Tim Burton is by far one of his best. I have enjoyed most of Tim Burton's movies in the past such as, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Edward Scissorhands; so when I saw the commercials for Big Fish I was instantly drawn in. Not to mention, Ewan McGregor is in it, so I was in love instantly! When I saw this movie, I was not disappointed and that is obvious because I saw Big Fish in theatres three times while it was there and the day it came out on DVD, I bought it. <BR>The movie is the story of a young man named Will (Billy Crudup) whose father Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying. They had not spoke for a few years after Will's father took the spotlight at his wedding telling one of his outrageous tales. Now, while is father is lying in bed at home, Will who has grown up being told the many miraculous stories and tales of his fathers life, wants to find out the truth about all of the stories. Will does not believe that any of the stories that his father told him throughout his whole life are true and he feels he does not know who is father really is. As the stories and the movie unfold, Will learns more about his father and himself, as well as the reasons for the stories that his father told. <BR>The movie goes back and forth between the present, and the stories being told as back-flashes. Young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) is the center of all the tall tales that include a witch with a glass eye that shows how people die, a perfect little town called Spectre with no road to it and even a giant named Karl. Each story is told with Tim Burton's usual sense of imagination, sensational imagery and darkness. The stories all revolve around events that happened in Edward Bloom's life, but each tale in the movie reflect a real tall tale. <br />The actor's in this movie are all wonderful at the parts they portray. Ewan McGregor is excellent as the young, charismatic Edward Bloom. Albert Finney makes the old Edward Bloom glow, even though he is sick in bedmost of the time. The contrast between the two actors as young and old is perfect. Jessica Lange as Will's mother and Alison Lohman as a young Sandra Bloom are also wonderful in this movie. The casting in this movie was amazing and adds a lot to the rest of the movie as a whole. <BR>Although Big Fish is a wonderful spectacle to see, I don't recommend watching it while you are tired because then it will seem a little slow. Believe it or not, I watched it once when I was tired and actually fell asleep. Every once in awhile there are parts that seem to kind of drag. That is made up for, however, in the great storyline and the colorful imagination and display of each story. I recommend this movie to be seen by everyone at least once and bring a box of Kleenex for the first time. Big Fish is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and genders. Since there is very little profanity and slight, but tasteful, nudity, this is a good family film and one that I even thought was appropriate to watch at a church youth group event. If you love Tim Burton's older movies, you will definitely love this one. Even if you didn't love his other movies, I still recommend everyone to rent this movie and see this outstanding spectacle at least once.

B0007CNXUU|5.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is a deeply moving, poetic film, based on the life of Scottish playwright and novelist James Matthew Barrie, and adapted from Allan Knee's play \\"The Man Who Was Peter Pan.\\" It is a fictional account of how Barrie came to write \\"Peter Pan,\\" which has long been a beloved children's classic symbolizing everlasting youth.<br /><br />Johnny Depp gives an unusually understated, sensitive performance as J. M. Barrie, who is facing a crisis in life. His latest play is not receiving accolades, and his marriage has grown cold and sterile. He meets Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, (Kate Winslet), a widowed mother of four sons, and immediately hits it off with her boys - played by Joe Prospero, Nicholas Roud, Luke Spill, and the extremely gifted Freddie Highmore as Peter. Although he is friendly with Sylvia, it is with the children that he is able to take-off on glorious flights of imagination. And the five of them soar. Their back-yard games transform into fantasy imagery. They're flying!! The results are remarkable scenes played out as adventures, veritable fetes of daring. He and the boys act as pirates sailing the Spanish Main, cowboys and \\"red Indians\\" riding the plains of the old West.<br /><br />In reality, however, this is Edwardian England, not the Wild West, and Barrie's friend Arthur Conan Doyle, (Ian Hart), warns him of vicious gossip about his \\"unseemly\\" interest in the family. Barrie responds with disgust. As he becomes increasingly involved with the boys, tension escalates between him and his upper-class wife, Mary, (Radha Mitchell). Sylvia's mother, Emma (Julie Christie), also lifts a questioning brow, wondering why on earth a grown man would spend so much time with children, and someone else's to boot!<br /><br />Barrie's deep feelings for Sylvia and her boys are genuine. A decent man, he never had kids of his own, nor did he have much of a childhood. Complex and creative, emotionally immature with a brilliant mind, he carves out a realm for himself with the Davies family, his own Neverland of sorts. He lavishes them with affection, gifts, and tons of energy as he enacts, with them all, his inspired games. His poignant longing for the childhood he missed is evident. For me, Barrie epitomizes the \\"lost boy.\\" The children, in turn, love him back and gift him with the inspiration for his haunting tale of Peter Pan, the youth who refuses to grow up. In David Magee's screenplay, Sylvia is the female figure in Barrie's fantasies - like a Wendy - more maternal than wifely.<br /><br />Sorrow and loss lie just over the horizon from this world of fantasy and delight, but I will keep them at bay here. Let it suffice to say that some dark themes are explored. Director Marc Forster has delivered a fine period piece, with amazing sets and costume design. The acting is superb. Johnny Depp imbues the film with a sense of wonder. Ultimately, \\"Finding Neverland\\" is about holding on to the all the magical aspects of childhood and keeping the imagination alive. This movie touched me deeply. PS - bring some extra tissues along.<br /><br />JANAor himself with the Davies family, his own Neverland of sorts.

B00005JKGO|5.0|I watched this movie once, a year prior to moving to Italy to study and work. I found it very mesmorizing. I didn't think much of the ending, but a day later I couldn't shake it from my mind. Fellini films seem to implant certain images in your mind. 8 1/2 can do this to you too. This is not the sort of movie you have to be an art major to decipher. It's pretty straight-forward and very enjoyable. The characters are well-constructed. Even minor characters are very unique. It's like being transported to a strange world.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Aight, everyone is coming on here and saying how awful this album is.  They're all wrong.  After Get Rich or Die Tryin' I became a hardcore 50 fan, and I was unspeakably excited about The Massacre.  There was no possible way it could live up to my expectations or the standard's 50 set with his debut album.  I'm not gonna tell you he did reach 'em, cuz he didn't.  And i think this is why people are bashing The Massacre so much.  Just because the guy can't live up to the ridiculously high hype he had doesn't mean the album is bad.  The first few times through it might not seem so good, but each track grows on you the more you listen to it.  There are some outstanding songs on here like the singles, Candy Shop and Disco Inferno, along with Outta Control, I'm Supposed to Die tonight, Gatman and Robbin', and My Toy Soldiers.  So anyone who loved 50's first effort, you would be missing out if you skipped The Massacre.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I read the book and thought little of it with all its tall tales.  When you read such book with a closed mind, you toss it away as merely child's play.  Daniel Wallace probably wrote it with the intention of the reader to interprete on their own.  But, it takes someone like Tim Burton to really give life into this life journey.  Alot of the stories are interwoven and Burton puts flesh on the characters so we are not totally disillusioned by all this fiction.  This is why I probably enjoyed the film much more than the book.  I remembered alot of the plot but seeing it through Will made a big difference.<br /><br />The DVD is jammed-packed with lots of features which Tim Burton fans will enjoy.  I think that this DVD would make a great collection if you are a big fan.  Also, it shows how a simple story can be great through a creative mind like Burton.  Sometimes, we just have to open our minds a little bit to see the big picture.  I think I learned alot from watching the movie and will read the book again.  After watching someone's interpretation on the screen, it makes you think twice after reading a book with a closed mind.

PLUS, HE ALSO TRYS TO STAY STRAIGHT FOR HIS PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND [PENELOPE ANN MILLER]. THIS VIOLENT GANGSTER MOVIE IS REALLY ENJOYABLE AND IT OFFERS GREAT PERFORMANCES FROM EVERYONE INVOLVED. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT AL PACINO DIDN'T WIN AN OSCAR FOR HIS PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE. I DOUBT SERIOUSLY IF ANY OTHER ACTOR PUT ON A BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN HIM IN 1993. IF YOU LIKE GANGSTER MOVIES, THEN THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF YOUR BEST BETS. THERE'S NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN THIS MOVIE.
B0007O38F8|3.0|I'm a 50 Cent fan, G-Unit fan, yeah. I know what I listen to their music for  and it's not mind-blowing lyrics and ideas that will make me contemplate the universe. Of course, OF COURSE this album isn't as good as Get Rich Or Die Trying, but in my opinion, Power of the Dollar was on Get Rich Or Die Trying's level. Therefore, THIS AINT NO SOPHOMORE JINX. It's really his 3rd album. Yeah he has slipped a little bit, but look, I've been a 50 Cent fan from the underground. I'm not gonna jump on the bandwagon with a bunch of other rap fans and now decide to hate him just because \\"everybody's doin' it.\\" I admit, as a person, 50's gotten to acting like a real prick, but he still makes decent music. The album has some good club bangers and \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" is actually a cool concept. That's a pleasant surprise from 50. The Hate It Or Love It Remix is hot, Disco Inferno, Candy Shop, My Toy Soldier, Ski Mask Way, etc. There are only a couple songs I think that are mediocre. I don't see any bad tracks on here though. The reason this CD's overall rating is so low is b/c all the haters are reviewing this album w/o listenin to it. And if they did, they hate 50 still anyway, so they aint gonna give him credit. Bottom line is, this CD is another above average G Unit release. I just hope 50 realizes his mistakes when this album doesnt sell as well and he really gets a sense for how many people don't like him anymore. Maybe then he'll REALLY get back on track. What can I say? I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and a second chance.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|The basic plot revolves around Donnie, a teenage schizophrenic, with an imagined friend in a bunny suit named Frank. It is a very interesting concept and leaves viewers questioning.<br /><br />Richard Kelly stated that his version would answer some of those questions and provide better understanding than the original release. Simply put, the Director's Cut does not meet this expectation.<br /><br />I had already paid $20 for the first release, but because I loved it so much, I absolutely HAD to have this new and allegedly improved version as well. I regret this purchase because I really don't have money to waste. There are very few actual scenes added and none are of any great significance or change the meaning of the film. There was one scene regarding his medication that added a bit of a twist... but I don't even think it was in the final version of the movie, but listed as a deleted scene instead. One would have to watch the two versions back to back to catch all of the changes... that is how insignificant the added scenes are. Some of the things NEEDED to be cut - for example, the eye scenes and the pages from the book on time travel (you'll know what I'm referring to if you've seen this version). Those scenes just did not transition well into the movie. Instead of adding meaning, they were distractions. The eye seems completely unnecessary and the information from the book would have been much better if displayed as text on the bottom of the screen or in some other, less intrusive means. Another noticeable difference is one of the ending scenes... in the director's cut there are black lines/boxes over the images, which looks very amateur - as if it was done in photoshop and not done very well at that.<br /><br />The bonus disc of special features is yet another disappointment. It's boring even to a fan of the movie. I fell asleep during it. I did not have that problem during the special features of the original 2001 release.<br /><br />Buy the first release of Donnie Darko (which gets 5 stars from me). Don't bother with this version unless you have a free rental coupon and everything else is rented out. I resisted the urge to rate this version even lower than I did, because it would be good... if a better version hadn't already been released.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is a masterpiece that rewards listening after listening.  \\"Deloused\\" was also a masterpiece of this order, but \\"Frances\\" offers other riches for the sonically adventurous besides.  My personal favorite is the free-jazz flute and saxophone on \\"Cassandra Gemini\\" (when the saxophone starts screaming and honking with digital delay on it, I find myself wishing that Pharoah Sanders or someone like him would have established this as the norm in jazz years ago or, vice versa, that punk/heavy music would have used free-form sax years ago: the horizon for music to come).<br /><br />The first time I listened to it I was not sure if it was as good as \\"Deloused,\\" though I certainly loved what I heard.  On the second through fifth listens, I began to hear that it was different from \\"Deloused,\\" but at least equal.  Now I find it is almost completely irrelevant to say which one is better.  They are both completely realized.  These pieces demand analysis and re-evaluation like great pieces of literature and more serious music, like Beethoven or Schoenberg.  Something that Cedric said about listening to \\"Deloused\\" with a dictionary handy to decode all of his portmanteau words made me think about a work I am studying in my studies for my Ph.D. in English literature: \\"Finnegans Wake\\" by James Joyce.<br /><br />That work, too, makes little sense in any conventional fashion.  You can read its six-hundred pages over and over again and never rope in any single meaning to its stream of words, but it is always intensely moving.  When Cedric intones \\"I think I've become one of the others\\" at the beginning of \\"Cassandra Gemini,\\" I still am not sure what he is getting at on my thirtieth listen or so, but I am sure that it rouses me more than any other spoon-fed lyrics I am supposed to adore from those alternative flavors of the month that flash and fade.  These guys will burn brightly when other more instantly-rewarding artists flicker, much like James Joyce is still firmly on the literary radar unlike those who criticized him for his difficulty back in the day.<br /><br />Trying to figure out whether \\"Frances\\" is better than \\"Deloused\\" is like trying to figure out whether Joyce's \\"Wake\\" is better than his masterpiece \\"Ulysses.\\"  You will have great conversations about it and talk yourself in circles, but you will come to the conclusion that both works are simply those that you will never stop returning to because they speak to something beyond conventional experience and native to conventional experience at the same time.

038572179X|5.0|Ian McEwan does almost too good a job in \\"Atonement\\"--he creates in Briony Tallis a character so believable in her juvenile self-righteousness that she loses traction as a narrator. You just don't want to spend time around this annoying little girl. But stick with this book through to the shattering finish--it's worth it. McEwan has genuine gift for plot and atmosphere: This book combines the best elements of a period tragedy with a tight, suspenseful mystery. Scenes set in WW2 are horrifically real and moving in the best sense. And he wraps the book up in finish both shocking and satisfying, an indictment of both childish sins and the act of writing itself. (I only wish I had read this book a few months earlier: All the upper-class British romantic romping kept evoking in my mind visions of Charles and Camilla!) <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|I'd been looking forward to seeing this film since the day I first read a rumour that Mel Gibson was going to do a film about the Passion entirely in Latin and Aramaic. I knew this was going to be a very special film long before it made headlines and became the centre of great and unnecessary controversy. Yesterday I was not disappointed. Josh Sewell has already put it more elegantly than I can when he writes, \\"I've been rendered nearly speechless... The Passion of the Christ... defies the typical 'it's good' or 'it's bad' mentality of a review. It's so visually gripping, so heart-wrenching and so emotionally draining that writing about it simply can't do it justice.\\" <br /> <br />The film begins at night in the garden of Gethsemane in Jerusalem. Jesus (played by Jim Caviezel, an actor I have great respect for ever since his excellent performance in Kevin Reynolds' film of The Count of Monte Cristo) is betrayed by his disciple Judas to the high priest Caiaphas and, next morning, brought before Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator of Judaea. Originally, Gibson had intended The Passion of the Christ not to have subtitles, saying that the acting was to convey enough of the story for subtitles to be superfluous. Later he compromised and had the film subtitled. The subtitles do make the details of the story clear, so this particular compromise was not a bad decision, but I suspect from the generally quite stylised acting that Gibson still intended not to have subtitles while he was shooting. That the Passion was filmed entirely in Latin and Aramaic was a stroke of genius, and part of the great lengths Gibson went to in order to achieve a sense of historical accuracy. I certainly cannot fault his portrayal of the Romans: they do admittedly speak Latin with an Italian accent (partly because the actors are Italian, partly because they were coached by a Jesuit who presumably pronounces Latin consonants the medieval or modern Italian way), but they speak it fluently, as if itreally were their everyday speech, and all of them look right and act perfectly, and their clothing, armour, weapons and hairstyles are completely accurate as far as I know. Pilate himself is actually played by a Bulgarian (which is audible in the way he pronounces the letter L) who really looks the part and manages to convey a lot of powerful emotions restrained by military and political discipline. <br /> <br />Caiaphas demands that Jesus be executed for blasphemy. Pilate refuses but, terrified that he will have a bloody uprising on his hands which will result in his own execution on the orders of the Emperor, orders his second in command, Abenader, to have Jesus severely punished in the hope of appeasing Caiaphas. Abenader unwittingly delegates the task to a group of sadistic soldiers who cane Jesus and then, probably provoked by his incredible stoicism, scourge him. The scourging is one of the most horrific and bloody scenes I have ever seen, and rightly so. The film has been criticised for being sadomasochistic, a criticism that is idiotic. We are bombarded every day with scenes of violence intended as entertainment, desensitising us to our detriment. The Passion of the Christ shows violence for what it really is in all its true, disgusting, dehumanising horror, a horror that takes on a further dimension when I consider, through my tears, that I have just paid to watch a man being ripped to shreds while the people all around me munch loudly on popcorn. <br /> <br />Caiaphas is not satisfied and demands that Jesus be crucified. Pilate tries one last time to avert the inevitable. He tells the mob that they can save one condemned man from execution and tells them to choose between Jesus and Barabbas, a murderer. To his disbelief the mob choose to pardon Barabbas. Jesus is to be crucified. <br /> <br />Another criticism of the film has been that it is unrealistic in that, amongst other things, Jesus is forced to carry his cross to Golgotha after having been mortally scourged. Do I need to point out the irony here? When Jesus falls on the way and seems unable to continue, the accompanying Roman soldiers rope in the unwilling Simon to share his burden. When Jesus falls again, Simon finds that the cross the horrifically injured Jesus managed to carry a part of the way on his own cannot be born by an able-bodied (but mortal) man. <br /> <br />Finally, the crucifixion. As Josh Sewell points out, \\"Most films about Jesus... make crucifixion seem slightly unpleasant\\". The Passion of the Christ shows exactly what this hideous form of execution really entailed. <br /> <br />The most widespread and unjust criticism of The Passion of the Christ is that it is anti-Semitic. How anyone can make such an accusation and how anyone can take it seriously beats me. It is Roman soldiers who cane Jesus, who scourge him, who beat him, insult him, spit on him, press a crown of thorns onto his head and crucify him, all on the orders of a Roman procurator. And nobody in their right mind would ever accuse the film of being anti-Italian, just as I have never heard anyone accusing, say, Schindler's List of being anti-German or The Lord of the Rings of being anti-Orc. Ridiculous doesn't even begin to describe such accusations. Probably the only reservations I myself have against the film are that not all the actors pull their weight: in my opinion, Mary, Simon and John are all very weakly portrayed. <br /> <br />Ultimately, The Passion of the Christ is not even a proselytising film. It is a film about the tragedy of mankind: about man's bloodlust, about his inexhaustible cruelty to his fellow man, about his cowardice, conformity and hypocrisy, about the pleasure he takes in the suffering of others, and about his fatal lack of empathy and compassion.

B00030590I|2.0|This movie almost put me to sleep.  I felt like I had been in the theatre for 3 hours.  This style of movie making just doesn't work for me.  Yes,  the visuals were very good.  The music was fine, but after an hour it starts to wear on you.  The acting is quite good, though.  Ziyi Zhang is always great.  It's the directing I have the biggest problem with.  The transition from present to past is not done very well.  Sometimes you can't tell if you are watching a past event or a present one.  The endless fight scenes become tedious after a while.  There are many pointless, and long, scenes added in that have nothing to do with the plot.  For instance, do we really have to spend 15 minutes discussing the importance of Caligraphy in the fighting style of Broken Sword?  Five minutes would have been fine for me.  What was the point of Flying Snow killing Broken sword in one story and then fighting/killing Moon shortly afterwards?   None, nada.  It seems like half the scenes in the movie are filler like this.  Jet Li's character is a little disapointing.  Every fighter he goes against in this is better than he is.  Sky lets him win.  He can't beat Broken Sword or Flying Snow either.  The only character in the movie he can beat, supposedly, is the Emperor.  Shouldn't Jet Li be the dominant character?  Oh, well.  These are just a few things that bothered me.   Maybe I'm just too pragmatic for some Chinese, artsy, films.

Now this is true cinema at it's finest, if you expect snap, crackle, and pop your not getting it, nor silly inuendo and such. This film is a about a man, plain and simple, a man who seemed to have everything but he wanted nothing other than the simplest thing, it is a tale about a man... nothing more. so if your expecting something miraculous your not getting it this is just cinema, and a great example of cinema at that.
0553103547|4.0|I must admit that initially I was prepared to hate A Game of Thrones and the name of G. R.R. Martin if only because the hype surrounding the series and the author was bordering on insane.<br /><br />I stand corrected. Of the many fantasy novels out there this perhaps one of the few that relies on a well thought out multilayered plot as opposed to overused, uninspired, material concerning love interests, mystical prophecies, and magic. Make no mistake, Martin's story is grim, gritty, and bloody to the bone. People are raped, murdered, betrayed in the worst way, and some even are involved in incestuous affairs. As other reviewers have remarked for some this is too much, I disagree on that. While the 2 or 3 sex and rape sections are can be gut wrenching they are not- with the exception of one concerning Dany's wedding nigh- very graphic. And even if they are hard to stomach, a rape scene is SUPPOSED to be disturbing. If the author is depicting such scenes they should have an impact on the reader.<br /><br />And as for there being mass slaughtering of lovable characters, well minor characters aside who do not have much screen time I can only name one and his death was as tragic as can be. Other points of contention state that there are no 'bad guys' on either side of the story, this also is not true. It is pretty clear who the better people are in the book, and who has been wronged though the author does not skimp on making his villains human either with good people in their employ. And lastly, Martin has written very compelling female characters who find various ways to circumvent their second class status spurred on by love, honor, or otherwise.<br /><br />The only reason I give this book 4 stars, is because there is no real climax at the end of the book and some of the characters are not as fleshed out as they should be. But there is the sequal to remedy that. This is no Chaucer,Tolkien or Peake but for a contemporary fantasy novel it is among the most engrossing, and among the best out there.t out there.

B0007GAEW6|4.0|While it is necessary to point out the apparently excessive amount of tracks on the album, it would serve all of you to know the real reason for the abundance.  Too many of the reviewers here are writing nonesense.  There were originally only five tracks on the album.  However, this would have TECHNICALLY made the album an EP according to the label.  Long story short, they ARBITRARILY divided the album into extra tracks, for no other reason than to satisfy the requirements of their contract.  That's it!  That's all!  So please stop writing (or reading) reviews that claim some type of uber-pretentious masterplan.  There wasn't, and this was issued by the band themselves in a press release.  I'm not making this up.  There are plenty of other things to dissect on the album, so go for it, just not this....sorry.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|I happily dived into The Mars Volta's latest album with hopes that they could overcome some of the prominent flaws of Delused, but sadly, almost everything about Deloused that I didn't like have been amplyfied in Francis. <br />Frances is to Delused as Delused is to any At The Drive In album.  Unfortunately, to my ears these are not steps up, but rather a band devolving from origional into just another band that screams. This album dotes on the quiet whispering sound to screaming technic. Don't forget the prominent intermissions between the songs in the beggining of the album. It isn't static feedback, like Wilco's \\"Less Than You Think,\\" but just mixes of random noises, with the occasional quote or scream. The intermissions certainly show more effort than plain static, but are just as annoying. <br />However, the parts in the album inwhich The Mars Volta does rock out, it occasionally sounds nice, even if you have to accept that they are completely changed from when they were part of At The Drive In. <br />Frances as a whole is not a joy to listen to. It is a guitar solo epic, however with lyrics and annoying sound effects. It has some good parts, but they are so sparse that it is very tough to pick and choose and play the pieces of the album that actually sound like songs. <br />However enticing any album based from a ATDI satellite may be, I would recomend to keep your hands off this one.
B0007O38F8|5.0|i think that the Massacre is better than Get Rich. the beats were better. also most songs are better then the Get Rich. however, i do see so bad parts in this album. some of the lyrics are weak. i was like what the heck is a gangsta sayin somethin like that for. but like i said, for the most part, this is better then Get Rich. Baltimore Love Thing is prolly my favorite. i lile all the songs but like 1 or 2, but i don't hate them. 50 Cent is tight, but the only thing that i wanted to see was more of Eminem's hands in The Massacre.
B0001AP12G|3.0|Overall this is a solid album with some great beats and creative songs (Jesus Walks), but to call this the best hip hop album of 2004 is flat-out ridiculous! Nas' album \\"Streets Disciple\\" lyrically DESTROYS this album. Maybe \\"College Dropout\\" is one of the 10 best albums in 2004 but even that is a bit of a stretch. Anyways, Kanye gets some credit for coming out with an album that strays (somewhat) from the usual commercial crap subject matter that we see polluting the stores these days (i.e. constant bragging about Escalades, name-dropping of dead and/or wack rappers, bragging about bling-bling) but this album is NOT nearly as revolutionary as early KRS 1, Rakim, Nas or Public Enemy. Please don't get it twisted. Also, there are way too many skits on this album that somewhat detract from the overall enjoyment of the album.  Then again, the beats are off the hook....so should you buy it? Sure, but not before you buy Nas, Biggie, Canibus or Wu Tang Clan (their albums from 1993-1997) albums.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|This is an amazing album.  It serves as a logical successor to Deloused In The Comatorium in that it expands on the former's sound without copying it or making a concious effort to change.  It almost sounds like they tried to split it down the middle, because the ballads got a whole lot poppier (The Widow) and the weirdeness got a whole lot weirder (Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore.)   <br /> <br />This doesnt quite measure up to Deloused, or to Cedric and Omar's old band At The Drive-In, but it is still fantastic and serves as a great introduction to the mars volta.
B0007O38F8|1.0|After Get Rich or Die Tryin I was expecting something really good from this fool but I was disapointed big time. The first time I even heard the cd be played I was at the homies house and he started playing it and he danced his ass off to it.. i was like \\"what the hell is wrong with you? this aint 50 cent!\\" i really was hoping it wasnt but it was. and thank God i didnt pay for the cd. even tho i hated the first song i heard i still wanted to at least give it a chance.. so i just allowed it to play through all the way in my car.. lyrics are just horrible. there are a few decent songs.. i guess.. for this album it will take some time for me to kinda \\"adapt\\" to it. i dont recommend buying it thats for sure, burn it or sumthin, plz dont waste ur money on it. If you want somethin tight then get The Game, i bang that everyday.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie can be summed up in one word - commitment.  Noah (the husband) is faithful to his wife and in his own words he has loved someone with all his heart and soul and that is success enough for him. <br /> <br />Yes, the story is a bit corny and simple but then these two people who met in 1940, married sometime in the late 40s and are STILL happily married in 2004, come from a simpler time. <br /> <br />This is not about action, violence, sex or $$.  If you don't understand the depth of love the two characters have for each other, then you don't understand the movie. <br /> <br />Watch this movie with your significant other......this is not a chick flick.  It is about the way marriage commitment should be....
B00025ETIW|5.0|This CD, in my own opinion, I do realize that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, especially when it comes to music.  But truely this CD is pure energy through the whole thing.  Yeah the lyrics at times can be cheesy and cliche, but other times the lyrics just blow me away.  I found myself listening to the same 30 seconds of Helena, the first song, before I made it on to the next song.  Most CD's I buy always have songs that disapoint me, but this CD to me has NO Bad songs.  All of the songs are so catchy, I find it so hard to hit the skip button on my CD player.  To name  a favorite on the CD is almost impossible.  But I like \\"You know what they do to guys like us in prison\\" \\"Hang Em High\\" and \\"It's not a fashion statement, it's a deathwish.\\"  Also if you get a chance check out their first one, that one I love too, and check out their song \\"Bury Me In Black.\\"  It was released on the single of \\"I'm Not Okay.\\"  If you love the song \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise),\\" you will love the CD.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Legally Blonde is a fine film that has so much sweetness that it could sicken you but will give you a great time as well with a charming performance by Reese Witherspoon and a great supporting performance from the rest of the cast. The plot is simple enough but it's the spunk of the main character that will win you over and put a smile on your face. <br /> <br />Hey, it's a chick flick but it's a pretty good one. <br />
B000002WU9|5.0|This a classic from start to finish, vn the intro is classic. <br />Killer Tracks: Verbal Intercourse, Criminology, Incacerated Scarfaces, Heaven & Hell. <br />dont get me wrong other tracks to a classics but those are my favourite.
B00005R62K|5.0|Undoubtadly the best album in the 70's from Judas Priest, \\"Stained Class\\" was where the legendary metal act found their sound and style after experimenting with their previous releases.  Drummer Les Binks' added a new dimension to the band as they discovered a new kind of heaviness, as evident on opening track \\"Exciter\\", \\"Invader\\", \\"Saints in Hell\\", and the classic \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" which Binks even co-wrote.  And oh yeah, there's a little song on here called \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\", a cover which would later stir much controversy for the band when they became embroiled in a court case after the suicide of a fan.  This remastered version of \\"Stained Class\\" sounds better than ever, and includes two bonus tracks.  \\"Fire Burns Below\\" isn't anything as good as the songs contained here, while the live version of \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" is a nice little bonus.  All in all, \\"Stained Class\\" was the beginning of one of the most influential and revered metal acts of all time honing their sound and finding their direction, and it remains a masterpiece to this day.
B00025ETIW|5.0|how the hell would you know what MCR really is about when you've only heard 'i'm not okay' from MTV and their lame shows? <br /> <br />their music, beat, rhythm, lyrics, all is very swell. <br />gerard's voice and the effort and love he [as well as the band] puts into the music is all very good! <br /> <br />you have to give it a try. and before you even get this, get the first album. it's even better!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne's lack of talent is undeniable.  Music like this does not take talent to play, and it does not take talent to create.  Along with her 12 barre, 3 chord redundancy, Avril Lavigne has a hostile, screaming, screeching voice.  Every song on this CD follows the same pattern--Avril mutters some sarcastic sob story about how hard life was for her growing up in the suburbs, then the chorus comes in, over which Avril alternates in furious expressions of rage and frustration.  Avril Lavingne NEVER sings, but SCREAMS.  Every song features Avril's raging screams over walls of distorted guitar noise.  Do you people really think that angry yelling requires talent?  Making this type of music doesn't take talent.  All it takes is the backing a multi-million dollar record company.  Just about any teenage girl who can scream angrilly would be just as popular as Avril Lavigne if a record company speant millions of dollars to promote them.
B0000ADY9I|4.0|A previous reviewer said that this deluxe edition of The Allman Brother's \\"At Fillmore East\\" is perfect for casual fans.  That may seem misleading, but its true.  I am not a big fan of the band.  I've bought \\"Live at Atl. Int. Pop Festival,\\" the two disc retrospective \\"Road Goes on Forever,\\" and this.  This is ABB's definitive statement - Southern Blues in an almost jazz-improv setting.  The sound is breath-taking, large, and almost too much for one sitting. <br /> <br />\\"Statsburo Blues\\" is in its finest form on this album, and the same can be said of the rest.  \\"Mountain Jam\\" and \\"Whipping Post\\" are two of the best reasons to buy this edition - they benefit greatly from the deluxe treatment, clocking in at 33 and 22 minutes respectively.  \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" is equally demanding and amazing, featuring great work by the greatest slide guitarist of all-time, Duane Allman.  Unfortunately, he only worked through a few more songs before his death by a peach truck.  One can only wonder what could have been.  But for those of us not born to hear him live, or too old to reverse time and grow up on Southern Rock, this is a great introduction.  <br /> <br />How could an Allman Brothers Live album be anything other than deluxe? <br /> <br />Overall:  8 out of 10.
B0000025P9|5.0|This wasn't Toto's best selling album for nothing!  The songwriting, musicianship and production are as good as you'll find from any band and most of the songs are totally enjoyable!  Not many rock bands have a lead singer who can really sing but Bobby Kimball really blows you away!  There is a reason why Steve Lukather, David Paich and Steve Porcaro were very much in demand by other respected producers like Quincy Jones and others and listening to Toto IV tells you why. Don't listen to the petty critics of this album, many of whom would consider P Diddy a musical genius!  If you enjoy good music, there's no way you won't like this one!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I feel very sorry for you.  You sound like a bitter bitter man to link this wonderful movie to your bitterness over your guy losing the election last November.  Try to move on, ok?  Might be a good idea.  Denial ain't just a river in Egypt.  Oh, also, try to get your own thoughts on things too...just because there's a movement of jackasses who continue to propagate hatred based on a color (red or blue) doesn't mean you need to participate.  Feel the love man, feel the love. <br /> <br />In the meantime, I wonder how many of the \\"cool\\" people (when they were in high school) hate this movie and how many of the \\"intelligent nerdy\\" people love it.  This movie is what reality is for tons of smart, creative people.  It's about a creative, kind, and funny main character and his growth in reaching out to friends.  It's very intelligent in a really quirky way (which may be why it's so disdained...people crave fart jokes above all else it seems) and so warm-hearted.   <br /> <br />You can have your kids watch it--the worst word is pi$$ed off and it has a lesson of being ok with being different because life is good when you love and have those you love in your life.  Wonderful movie, wonderful message, yet, no preaching, it's very subtly done.  5 stars for me.
0553062182|5.0|I've reviewed the literature on \\"gifted adults\\" but this one is so practical and so understandable. Thank goodness - now I understand! Always called myself a closet introvert.
B00005QEO1|4.0|Aerosmith broke up at the end of the 80's, in part due to Steven Tyler's motor cycle accident.  But the band wasn't working well.  It had been a good five years since they released a really great album and with the failed blues-rock of \\"Rock and a Hard Place,\\" recovery looked like a thing of the past.  Joe Perry walked and made his own album.  The band finally split. <br /> <br />Upon the bands reunion, hopes were high but songwriting was weak.  \\"Done With Mirrors\\" remains today one of the bands most uninspired works.  Time seemed to have alluded \\"America's greatest rock and roll band.\\"  But they kept on and were rewarded with \\"Premanent Vacation,\\" a good pop-rock gem sporting no less than 3 blockbuster singles.  On their next album, \\"Pump,\\" Aerosmith had returned to form, and the album remains one of their best. <br /> <br />The one-two punch of \\"Young Lust\\" and \\"F.I.N.E.\\" set the adventurous, amourous tone and the band never lets up or looks back for a second.  The Stonesy aforementioned rockers combine with some of the band's finest ballads (\\"What It Takes\\") to make a consistent and interesting listen.  Aerosmith even dive into uncharted territory on the child-abuse concious \\"Janie's Got a Gun,\\" one of the band's most humanitarian songs.  And \\"Pump\\" has lost none of its savor.  Rock and Roll. <br /> <br />Overall:  8 out of 10.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|I'm surprised by the cult status and financial success of this film.  So many who claim to love this film, if they were honest with themselves would admit that they love laughing at the misfortune of others and looking down on people in order to feel superior, because let's face it...there are loners in high school who don't have any friends, so the people who love this movie so much...just how many loner/nerdy friends do you hang out with?  Just as I thought...none.    I believe Roger Ebert is correct in his review of this film...it was made to make people feel superior as they laugh at some of the most pathetic characters to ever grace the silver screen.  The only likeable character in the whole bunch is Deb, though she could use some pointers on which direction her pony tail should go (towards the back, not the side).  This film is all over the map...as the clothing styles of the main characters are holdovers from the polyester and butterfly collar 70s; the interior of the house with wood panel walls and top loading VCRs also put this family in league with the Brady Bunch; the school dance plays classic 80s songs; yet we know its in the 1990s because of Kip Dynamite's surfing the Internet for babes.    Napoleon Dynamite is an unlikeable nerd who doesn't have any friends, except for the new Mexican kid, who speaks with all the stereotypical accent of Slow Poke Rodriguez of the Warner Brothers cartoons (cousin of Speedy Gonzalez).  Watching this film, as painful as it is, it shouldn't surprise anyone why Napoleon is always picked on at school and has no friends and can't get a date.  His brother Kip is no better, hanging out at home with no job and getting involved in some salesman schemes when their used-car salesman looking uncle shows up one day with dreams of faded high school glory (\\"my life would be better if only the coach put me in the game the last quarter of the final game of my senior year!\\").  Napoleon and Kip live with their grandmother, who disappearsfrom the movie really quick, as even she can't stand to be around those losers and leaves them to fend for themselves in the cold, brutal, superficial world.    Does this movie have a point?  Not really.  It succeeds only if you consider the idea that the director's whole point of this film is to indite us as having superiority complexes for judging and laughing at the patheticness of these characters.  A lot of the scenes have humor in them, and I can easily imagine it going over really well in the Mormon culture of Idaho and Utah, where this film takes place (Preston, Idaho).  That the director is a graduate of BYU, which censored Hollywood films when I attended there, doesn't surprise me, as this film was made to Mormon specifications of \\"morality\\" (no profanity).  Unfortunately, they don't have a prohibition on bad taste, otherwise this film would've never seen the light of day.    Having said all that...its not the worst film I ever saw (that would be \\"Barton Fink\\"...the only film I ever walked out of the theater in the middle of).  I loved the opening credit sequence, which I thought was the most creative I've ever seen.  I also thought the ending was so manipulative in that the choice of song was lyrically brilliant and I couldn't help but smile when the film came to an end.  That was aggravating to me...a film I consider in poor taste that ends on such a brilliant note that I can't call it a complete waste of my time.  There were two other points where the director used two of my all time favorite 1980s songs (\\"Forever Young\\" by Alphaville and \\"Time After Time\\" by Cyndi Lauper), so I must add one star for the music selection of this film.  I also liked the Llama and wished to have seen more of that.  For me, the funniest moments of the film are with LaFawnduh and with Rex and his bodybuilding wife.  So, those characters saved this film from being a complete wash out with me...thus three stars instead of the automatic one that amazon.com gives all reviews.
B00005JLEX|4.0|Ah, Seinfeld.  The yardstick by which all sitcoms are measured.  Could anyone have guessed the impact this series would have on the western world?  Looking at the 18 episodes in these first two seasons, probably not.  But then again, you are probably not buying this DVD set just for the episodes, right?  Which is why I won't devote much time to the episodes themselves; it's the extras that warrent review.  Seinfeld is Seinfeld, and the episodes are notorious.  Chances are, you've already seen them all already; you may even own them (VCR!).  Sure, it'll be nice to revisit them every now and again, but these are the first episodes, and on their own merit they are far from outstanding, certainly not what we've come to expect from Seinfeld as the series progressed.  So a few short words on the episodes themselves, then to the main course - the extras.    The episodes themselves are not quite up to par.  It's understandable; after all, everyone was still finding their way.  The characters are still forming (with the exception of Jerry, who remained pretty much the same throughout the series). The episodes often suffer from the inexperience of the writers and producers; the pacing is often off,  and there are the occational gaps, dead moments, strange breaks, inappropriate transition points, etc.  It gets better towards the end of the second season, of course; by then the characters begin to resemble what they will later become, and the mechanics click much better.  The content improves as well; watching the first few episodes, you can understand why the series was struggling in the ratings.  The first truely full force \\"Seinfeld\\" episode in the entire lot is \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" (not surprisingly, it was the one the network had the hardest time approving).  Another problem with these episodes is that some of the more daring and fresh approaches they introduced, which made them pack a better punch 15 years ago, are lost on today's audience, who by now has a higher shock tolerance.  The mentioning of a period or bowel movements, which may have been rare in sitcoms in the early 90s, can now be the entire subject of an episode.  Still, it's fun to see the origin of things, to track the development of character traits, and to be able to say, \\"Hey, that's the first time they did that!\\".    As I've mentioned, the main value expected from the DVD (At least in my opinion) is the extras.  These, unfortunately, are a mixed bag.  Sure, there's lots of stuff.  There's a \\"How it began\\" documentary; there are \\"Notes about nothing\\" - subtitle notes that run through the episode for every episode; there are \\"Inside looks\\" segments for most episodes; there are voice-over commentaries for six episodes; there's a bloopers segment, an extra standup segment (standup bits of Jerry that didn't make the shows) and a few more trivial things such as photo galleries, previews, and Tonigh show segments.  All in all, there's a wealth of trivial and trivia spread around the four DVDs.  But quite frankly, some of the most interesting items are too few, too short, or too sparse in interesting information.    For me, the greatest dissappointment comes from what is possibly the most important extra in any DVD - the voice-over commentaries.  Only about a third of the episodes have these, and most of those are very sparce in interesting details.  Especially dissappointing are the commentaries by Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards, which are pretty banal (\\"oh, that's a nice dress; no it isn't! yes it is!\\").  Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld do a better job, and so does writer Larry Charles, but they do only four episodes.  I was seriously hoping for more, because these are the most interesting extras there are - taking you to the heart of episode, with thoughts, notes, anecdotes, etc.  I was surprised that the pilot episode, for example, didn't have voice over commentaries; surely there would be a treasure trove of information.  The \\"Inside looks\\" are nice.  These are interview sniplets with the cast and crew giving brief insight into each episode.  Unfortunately, some of them are pretty short, and many of them are rehashed from the \\"How it began\\" documentary (which is great, by the way).  Then there's the \\"Notes about nothing\\", Trivia tracks that run through the episode.  These are very interesting and in general add a lot of information on things like casting choices, changes in scripting, and occationally trivia bits on references made by characters.  In some episodes they repeat things that were already covered in the \\"inside looks\\".  Then there's a technical problem - they sometimes to run too fast, and it's hard to read them before they dissappear.  They can flash as fast as three a second - that's a bit much, and quite unnecessary, considering that other times several minutes can go by without a single note appearing.  The bloopers segment is great, but short.  I would have imagined they had more to show after so many episodes (but of course I could be wrong).  A nice touch is showing previews from the bloopers in season three (Jerry Stiller!!!).  The previously unseen standup is also great, and deleted scenes are interesting (even if there are no more than about 10 minutes of them from all 18 episodes combined).  The rest of the stuff is pretty minor, if nice (Especially the Carson show bits).    There's lots of stuff here, to be sure.  I would have liked better quality, and in some areas, more quantity; but over all, it's still enough to leave the trivia hunters satisfied.  So it's not a full meal - you still won't leave hungry.    Spongeworthy?  Sure, why not.
B0007P3582|5.0|Everyone who claims 50 Cent's new cd \\"The Massacre\\" as \\"garbage\\" is just angry over the fact that 50 Cent disses, calls out, and completely erradicates Murder Inc., anyone associated with Murder Inc. and several other rappers. <br /> <br />I won't go into detail, but while 50 Cent's newest release didn't match up to his original \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" it definately does an excellent job or providing his fans with another great release. <br /> <br />I'm very satisfied with my purchase, and I highly recommend that you get a copy as well.
B00013RC9I|4.0|Air misstepped with \\"10,000 Hz\\" and the remix album was even more abhorrent.  The soundtracks and songs in between the classic \\"Moon Safari\\" and 2004 were nice but fans wanted what they paid to hear.  \\"Walkie Talkie\\" is that rare return-to-form album that is more than just an attempt, but a success.  Granted, times have changed musically, but Air manage to cop their own songwriting strength from 1998 and disguise it in forward-looking effects.  And the results are breath taking. <br /> <br />The album is drenched in keyboards and whispering wind.  The silky production turns average-Joe tunes into lavish mind-trips.  And the songcraft is second only to their own 1998 masterpiece.  \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\" and \\"Surfing on a Rocket\\" were obvious choices for singles, but when playing the album front to back, they don't particularly stand out.  The entire album is pretty consistent.  And \\"Venus\\" has style and heart that Moby only dreams of.  The cheeky \\"Mike Mills\\" comes off as either a diss or a tribute.  Who cares really?  An excellent album.  Welcome back, boys. <br /> <br />Overall:  8 out of 10.
1400049628|5.0|Funny and informative, The Zombie Survival Guide offers practical advice for avoiding those nasty preternatural creepies from beyond the grave.  Brooks' book is full of interesting facts about the various types of zombies and the best ways to dispose of them.

0723284075|3.0|it's a nice collection, just smaller than I thought.  The books are only 4 x 5.  Too small for a child to read and hard for an adult to read and show.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|A technical complaint first, and then the real review. :-) <br /> <br />I'm not sure what it is about Disney's DVDs, but the \\"widescreen\\" format never quite works correctly on my system. I have to play with the zoom setting to see the whole picture, but by then it's much smaller than the screen on ALL sides; playing it without the zoom cuts off the sides and it looks like any old FULLscreen cut. EVERY Disney DVD that I own does this and it's quite annoying, as the rest of my widescreen DVD's work just fine from any other studio. It's a real headscratcher.  <br /> <br />Aside from that complaint, the film itself is beyond perfection! Gorgeous animation, strong characters, amazing story, BRILLIANT film score, wonderful voice cast for the English track. Just to have the entire movie, and not the horrid U.S. edit (Warriors of the Wind), is a wonderful WONDERFUL thing. I had no idea this was coming out, so my surprise at seeing this on the shelf in the video store was such that I had a few tears welling up in my eyes and I bought it immediately. I'm so happy Miyazaki's films are getting a well deserved release here in the US! ^ . ^  <br /> <br />Also, Joe Hisaishi is one of the most brilliant film composers of all time; every film I watch with a Hisiashi score, it's the music that I remember the most; it is so touching and beautiful, and affects me in powerful ways - as GOOD music should.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|The end of the year is a quiet time in the music industry, especially with record sales declining in the last three or four years.  2004 wasn't much different with most of the good albums out of the way by September, leaving only subpar performances by big bands, a la \\"Around the Sun\\" by REM.  Then, Arcade Fire pulled a fast one with \\"Funeral.\\"  I admit, being financially restricted by both school and wife, I rarely buy music on a whim, so I covered my ears to the roaring praise of this album by pretentious, self-serving magazine and internet music critics.  To spite said pretentious plebians, I resisted purchasing this album until March of 2005, long after the rush.  All those critics were right, for once. <br /> <br />Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" really IS the best album of 2004.  \\"Tunnels\\" begs the questions; \\"can indie be this well-produced and still be indie?\\"  Answer: who cares?  When a hundred other bands are wearing their influences on their sleeve (think Interpol-Joy Division, Strokes-Velvet Underground, the Vines-Nirvana; you get the idea), \\"Funeral\\" at least FEELS like it was created ina vacuum.  How else can you explain the obvious 80's cliche of \\"Mickey you're so fine\\" proportions on \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" sounding like you've never heard anything like it?  How about \\"Wake Up?\\"  \\"Rebellion?\\"  The Lou Reed-Mo Tucker interplay of \\"The Black Seat?\\"  There's no explaination.  Or presedence.  This is the way indie sounds when it's directed by Steven Speilberg; big, brass, and beyond belief.  This may be the best album of millenium. <br /> <br />Overall:  10 out of 10.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a contract killer, who hires Jamie Foxx, a taxi driver, to play chauffer for the evening.  While Cruise's character is dynamic, and it is refreshing to see him in a \\"evil\\" role, I found Foxx's character lacking in the same depth. <br /> <br />The plot of the film is great and has an ironic twist at the end which I loved.  However, there were a few moments in which the action and dialogue grow tedious.  Also, I was often -- too often, for my tastes -- left wondering why Foxx's character didn't just leave Cruise high and dry.  The opportunity was presented several times throughout the film and nothing was done. <br /> <br />Overall, it was a good movie and enjoyable as one of Cruise's rare bad guy roles.  Foxx is a good actor but I simply could not relate to his character's plight.
B0007O38F8|4.0|It was alright the best tracks are \\"Ski Mask Way\\", \\"This is 50\\", \\"Im Supposed To Die Tonight\\", \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"GATman And Robbin\\",and A Baltimore Love Thing\\". I think 50 cent needs to stop being commercial and do his old gangsta flows again.
B00025ETIW|5.0|If you're open to any kind of music and willing to give anything a listen, chances are you'll end up likeing this band. <br />I listen to mostly Death Metal and Finnish metal, and when I first heard My Chemical Romance  over a year ago I did'nt think very much of them, they were too \\"emo\\" for me. But now things have changed, while I'm still into Death Metal very much, I find myself getting into those emo bands that I disliked before. <br />I heard this whole cd a few nights ago driving around with my cousins, and it's a very catchy and emotional album. Very well put together, and great vocal melodies.
B00005QENZ|4.0|\\"Get a Grip\\" is the apex of the Aerosmith Mach II, along with \\"Pump.\\"  While Pump sounds more like Aerosmith the bar band, \\"Get a Grip\\" is Aerosmith the arena rockers.  Every note of this album is calculated for better or worse;  Outside writers (Desmond Child), outside musicians (Lenny Kravitz), rehashed material (the \\"Walk this Way\\" intro).  Much of the album hasn't aged well either, like the rapping on the title track or the over-produced \\"Flesh.\\"  Many of the songs that acted like songs of a generation in 1993 sound like filler today.  Having said all that, \\"Get a Grip\\" is still a compelling listen and yes, it DOES have something for everyone.    \\"Eat the Rich,\\" though admittedly a bit hypocritical, is still better than the Stones have done in the last 30 years.  \\"Fever\\" borders somewhere on the line of high-octane blues and country (well, Garth Brooks DID cover it).  Lyrics on some of the lesser tunes, a la \\"Shut Up and Dance,\\" are poetic, clean-cut, and still funny as ever.  Finally, say what you will about their late ballads, but \\"Cryin\\" and \\"Amazing\\" still play in the messy rooms of generation X, 90s-minded individuals.    Overall:  7 out of 10.
0807219908|4.0|I read the book in an hour and a half. I must admit I wasn't overly anamored with it.  It wasn't until my sister, who works in  a public library, introduced me to the audio version, performed by Tim Curry, that I really began to appreciate the wit and humor of these books (Warning:  books 3 through 5 are read by \\"Lemony Snicket\\" himself and just don't have the same charm).   <br /> <br />These books are meant to be read aloud!  Tim Curry does a fantastic job at showing how all the adults, with maybe the exception of Count Olaf himself, are imbeciles in comparison with the Baudelaire children.  If ever there was a child power series of books, this is it. <br /> <br />No, it is not Harry Potter, but was it trying to be?   <br /> <br />Yes, there are some things that my be inappropriate for younger children.  There are in certain children's movies that parents pop in without thought(boy was I suprised when I saw a few of those as an adult).  Perhaps this will prompt some questions for discussion, questions our kids will be asking us anyway.  There are things our kids need educated about in order to be able to defend themselves against them. <br /> <br />Yes, it's the same thing over and over again. Anybody remember Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, Encyclopedia Brown?  Didn't we love those as kids?   <br /> <br />So--\\"Ho ho ho, hee hee hee.  Have a heart shaped balloon.\\"  Take these books for what they are worth: a twist on reality that pokes fun at adults. You may even increase your vocabulary while you're at it.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|O.k. <br />I love how hollywood pumps up the hype on all these lame \\" SO CALLED HORROR FLIMS!\\" 2 guys in a room for a long time, Wow scary!! GO get SHAUN OF THE DEAD OR BUBBA HO-TEP! those are the only cool FUN movies out in a long time! Oh the new Texas chainsaw re-make was damn cool too.
B0007O38F8|3.0|It never ceases to amaze me in how all of G-Unit's mixtapes are way better than the albums. I'm dissapointed in how some of the what I and many others thought great songs that were on the mixtapes didn't get on the album. Lyrically 50 is seriously lacking on this one but there are some good  punchlines. The beats are pretty good. You can't blame the guy though, it's pretty hard to followup an album like \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\". No more than three stars, no less than two and a half.
B000003S5H|5.0|The Trinity of 1990's trip-hop goes as follows: Massive Attack's \\"Blue Lines,\\" Portishead's \\"Dummy,\\" and Air's \\"Moon Safari.\\" Period. The first two have dated, albeit slightly, but \\"Moon Safari\\" still makes us yearn for a better yesterday, a simpler time, a right/wrong kind of people. Behold, the glory of the last decade!  <br /> <br />The dinner-party-ness of \\"La Femme D'Argent\\" is still reason enough to buy this album; all wind, trinkling keyboards, and staircase bass. Genre classics \\"Sexy Boy\\" and \\"All I Need\\" feature the stereotypical breathy female vocals over a drum machine, but Air's instrumental talent set them apart from most other 90's trip hop bands, giving the singles range. All 10 songs feature great song-craft, innimitable style and mood, and something that should've never been absent from trip-hop or 90's music in general - joy. One of those few musical contradictions; joyful and cutting-edge. This album still amazes its listeners. The perfect trip hop album.  <br /> <br />Overall: 9 out of 10. <br />
B00001OH7U|2.0|First, I must say that the two stars are not for the album itself, which is brilliant.  You should totally own a copy of this album.  Just don't buy the EMI version which is a blatent rip-off.  The earlier release of this album on the Ryko disc label not only offered a high-class CD sleeve with lyrics,  but also threw in some fine bonus tracks at a considerably cheaper price--and to my ears, the sound quality was no different.  Such is how it is on this version that (and all the other reissued that have replaced the Ryko disc versions--all of which included extra worthwhile material) we are promised an enhanced version of Station To Station.  And what does this mean?  Are we treated to a live video clip of one of the cuts off this album?  Hidden bonus tracks?  Photos?????   No!---what you get instead is a shameless advertisement to join the David Bowie world wide web community-for a fee.  That's right, it wasn't enough that you shelled out the extra cash for the disc, but if you want access to all those hitherto mentioned goodies, you have to shell out still more cash.  Shame on you, David (although I can't help but doft my hat at your entrepeneurial savvy!) for insulting us with this 'enhancement'; shame on you for thinking we'd be impressed with such fancy phrases like 'Sonic Solutions No Noise technology' or 'mastered to 16 bit . . . using Prism SNS Noise Shaping' in order to justify chincing on the extra tracks.  We weren't fooled for one minute . . . . . . were we?
B0006A9FKA|5.0|All I can say is WOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Finally, I have been waiting years for a awesome zombie flick like this! I love the EVIL DEAD MOVIES and this rates right up there with them! It has a great story, awesome zombie gore, and its funny as hell! After all the boring \\"so called zombie movies\\" that have been coming out, this was a total breath of fresh air! I bought 28 DAYS LATER and I tossed it in the trash, it sucked so bad! But SHAUN OF THE DEAD ROCKS!!!!!! forget the new Dawn of the Dead remake, Shaun of the dead BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER!!!!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I have listened to this cd once and i was hooked, and four times after that in one day!, Could it be that metal and real rock are coming back! This cd is excellent. It is great that the priest line up is back i never thought they would get back together but i was proved wrong,I hope to see them sometime this year it would be great, After just seeing motley crue a few weeks ago with their original line up, Its must be time to change the guard and real music return, after so many years of alternative and numetal nothing wrong with some of the new, but to see the mighty bands getting going again makes me wish for others to wake up, Megadeth made a pretty good cd last year but not the original lineup. and metallica is changed so much, my hope is judas priest can make more albums and tour, We need judas priest and motorhead to play all in one night i know that won't happen but it would be incredible. I'm glad that the priest didn't put an album out like velvet revolver did, it is alright but somewhere they missed, the priest hit the mark, the halford cds were also good expecially live insurrection, hopefully judas priest will make another live cd on this current tour or a dvd would be great too. Hope they come to Atlanta. In closing A five star cd That i hope blows away some of this wimpy stuff out there.
037571457X|5.0|I read Persepolis tonight.<br /><br />I mean the whole thing.  I started it after dinner, and just finished it at the 153rd page.  For those of you who've read, or should I say \\"experienced\\" this work, that won't come as a surprise.  For those of you who haven't, consider it a high-endorsement.  I had other plans for my night...<br /><br />..I also had my doubts about this work.  Despite the rave reviews, I've never even read a comic book.  That, coupled with the fact that at first glance, it seemed very...well, childish?<br /><br />Oh the shame!  Marjane Satrapi has created an apologetic convert out of me.<br /><br />Persepolis is the story of one girls experience during the fall of the Shah of Iran, the ensuing Islamic Revolution (which included Stalin like \\"purges\\"), and war with Iraq.  Only it's not told in plain text, but rather is a pictured in a comic book style.<br /><br />A history buff myself, I have an above-average awareness of the historical goings on of that period.  However, told in this unorthodox style, with pictures, through the creative and emotional eyes of a child, the \\"facts\\" gained a vibrance and color for me like never before.  The human side of history had so much more meaning, and seemed to imprint a deeper and easier understanding in my mind than most accounts.<br /><br />When I was thinking about what was so compelling about this book, I thought of Edward Tufte.  He's a famous professor and scientist in the field of displaying information graphically. I went to a seminar by him once.  He passionately explained the concept of neural bandwidth, and how most text and plain graphs don't take advantage of the massive processing power of our minds.  The pictures in Persepolis, coupled with Marjane's rich historical account seemed to take advantage of that latent neural ability.  For me, they compounded and achieved something of an emotional critical mass of understanding that few books have.<br /><br />So, like I said, I'm a convert.  I just ordered her second work \\"The Story of a Return\\".  Only this time, I'll have a nice bottle of wine, and no plans for the night.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, Californiaonvert.

B000056VJ7|2.0|If I see one more review about how \\"touching\\" or \\"brilliant\\" these songs are, I think I'm going to puke all over my keyboard. I never considered myself a fan of Meat Loaf but one sunny day I was helping my mother and her friend move some furniture and my mom's friend gave me this cd cause she found it in her car, but hated it. So I gladly accepted it and took it home to listen to. Not knowing what to expect, I laughed out loud at the ridiculously bombastic opening title track (which is actually one of the few decent songs). \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\"  and \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" are two of the worst, cheesiest, and most boring by-the-numbers \\"soft rock\\" ballads I've ever heard in my life. \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\" is humorous and pretty tasteful compared to most of the stuff on here, but why is it 8 minutes? 8 minutes!!! It might have been a nice 5 minute number, but NOOO  Meat Loaf has to stretch it out to epic proportions! There are ZERO smart musical ideas on here. \\"All Revved Up With No Place To Go\\" starts with a cool saxaphone part but the song never goes anywhere. It just stagnates annoyingly, until I'm grinding my teeth and batting my eyes reaching for the \\"skip\\" button. \\"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth\\" is the foulest song on the whole album, complete with an dumbass overdramatic intro. \\"You took the words right outta my mouth/musta been while you were kissin' me\\"?? It's not that I have anything against cheesy music in general, it just has to go somewhere, or sound decent. This whole album is mediocre at best. The title track is probably the best one on here, and it's almost 10 minutes and manages to be somehwat interesting the whole way through, so props to Meat Loaf for pulling that off! I give it one star for my personal assesment of the album, and one additional \\"novelty factor star\\". Yeah...screw this, go listen to the Ramones.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Do not listen to anyone who says this album is terrible or unlistenable.  The songs themselves, when you get down to them are great.  Creative lyrics generate some interesting imagery, some excellent baselines and guitar riffs with emotional singing.  But everyone of these songs are TOO LONG!!! But they need not be, this album could be at least 30 minutes shorter and lose nothing at all.  Each song has needless fluff at the beginning, end, and sometimes the middle of the music.  Sometimes there just barely audible sounds that add nothing to the music.
B0007P3582|4.0|although this album may not be great, it is ten times better than anything that has been put out in the last year. If you want knowledge and progress go listen to nas or some other soft rapper. This man has carved out a huge niche and obviously their are still millions of fans listening. From tracks 8 to 17 real fans will truly appreciate what he does. Also the first three songs are great. Their is no need to get deep if people dont want that. If you dont want to listen dont waste your time buying or burning. This is not gonna make you a fan or walk away
B00007ELEL|5.0|I caught a glimpse of this movie in 2001 and haven't stopped watching since. These are what comedies are made of, not only because Jeff Bridges' performance of The Dude is probably the best stoner characteer ever translated to film, but because it carries everlasting brilliance that many critics and movie-goers didn't see at the time. The Coen Brothers succeeded in making an eccentric film that could make you laugh at your own mother's funeral, and with memorable scenes and bits of dialogue loaded throughout, this is a movie not to be missed and belongs in any movie fan's DVD collection, so shut the f**k up, break out a glass of White Russian and enjoy yourself.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Call them whining, moaning idiots whose music has to be covered up by electronic 'noise' and sounds effects if you want, but it will only go to prove that you're a shallow critic. <br /> <br />This album is indeed a masterpiece, the best album I have had the pleasure of listening to (about 147 times over!). Look at all the other almbums in the world if you want - you won't find a better constructed, more emotional creation. <br /> <br />Perhaps it is the case that musicians will appreciate this albulm more than others, as it showcases the perfect fusing of 5 superb musicians, but surely this album must move non-musicians? <br /> <br />Each to his own...
B00005JMAH|5.0|When I first saw it, I thought it was so good and fuuny. I'll tell you one thing, the bus part is one of my favorite. Believe me; if you haven't seen it tnen rent it on vidio/dvd.
B000002UAX|5.0|The white album is an undeniable masterwork, but it is flawed. As The Kid pointed out the album could definetly use some trimming, not to the extent he suggests but the album has its low points, unlike Abbey Road or Rubber Soul which are perfect from start to finish. Don't get me wrong I absolutely adore this album and so many of its songs are benchmarks, but if a few of its songs were cut out (who seriously listens to revolution 9...) what would remain would be arguably the Beatles best.
B0000696I0|4.0|The beginning was very well done in this movie. Probably the funniest start to a movie i've seen in a while. The movie is very energetic with such scenes like the beginning, great fight scenes. This movie obviously had a bigger budget, 25 million dollars to make. Bigger sets, and a cheesy, and i mean it, cheesy publicity stunt by Vanilla Ice. While the movie fails on a dramatic point, it rules on fight scenes and comedy. This is the only movie i have ever scene get away, and have absolutely no explosives or bombs in the movie, and yet people like the fight scenes. Actors changed on Donatello and Shredder, the new actor for Shredder was impressive, really did have a resemblance to the first shredder. Donatello however, even though the new actor is equally talented in fights scenes, in some ways better then the original actor, he doesn't have that voice fans liked about the original actor, i can't remember any of the actors names playing the turtles. But they are talented, great fight scenes in those heavy costumes. Even doing flips in the costumes which is amazing, i always thought the flips from the original movie were done on strings because those costumes have to weigh a ton, but they were doing backflips in this movie. Truly amazing, Turtles ruled the 1991 year for their genre, 78 million in box office, a great number for this.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|I don't need to hear Old Santana mixed with Zeppelin. <br /> <br />This isn't new ground they're breaking, it's 30 year old music jammed together, and not well either. <br />TMV don't write songs, they \\"write\\" parts and put them together and they come across as such. <br />I found this cd to be utterly exhausting. <br />I've listened to it no less than 12 times to see if it had any \\"grow on you\\" factor. <br />I found that couldn't wait for it to end, much like a prison sentence. <br /> <br />A for effort, I'm glad that the Volta's are pushing themselves musically. <br />I just don't wanna go where they're headed. <br /> <br />Carlos Santana, Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant called, they want their music back. <br /> <br />
B0007O38F8|2.0|I gave this album 2 stars cos it has 2 good songs, Candyshop and Disco Inferno, and both of them have already been released. I couldnt wait for this album to come out, i still play Get Rich a lot cos its a classic album and i was expecting this to be good at least. I think its so bad cos Em and Dre's influence isnt there as much as it is in Get Rich, for his 1st album Em and Dre had last say on everything and produced a fantastic album, then 50 thought he was the best rapper alive with his 1 good album, decided he was a big boy now and could do it all on his own and produced an album with 2 good songs out of 22. <br />His lyrics are awful! They are uninteligent and childish.  <br />He slaggs Nas? Fat Joe, Ja Rule i can understand but Nas took him on tour when he was a nobody, so 50 repays him by slagging him AND his wife??  <br />I dont know, i just thought it would be better
B000058983|5.0|Over the years I have dabbled in a variety of bands ranging from Zeppelin to The Flaming Lips, but few albums have surprised me the way that Forever Changes has. It's such an intense blend of musical stylings that it is as hard to categorize as it is to fully grasp. Anyone who respects Dylan or The Doors, psychodelic or folk, melodies and mystery, owes it to themselves to listen to this album.
B0000696I1|4.0|I will admit, the costumes do look dull. They are trying to adapt to 1993's technology, which fails but the mouths do move better but the faces are horribly done. The movies story could have been worse, i mean for a live-action movie based on fantasy mixed with reality, it works well. 1993 i don't think was the year of these types of movies, even though this movie is way more enjoyable the The Power Rangers Series which debuted the same year. The action scenes do lose some flare, mainly due to the fact that a lot of it is real, i was amazed by the first 2 because it's so much harder to make fake punches look real, but this one had real martial arts trainers, because a lot of the guards that you see in this movie are trained professionals, and can take hits. I think that may have been a problem for fake characters and a PG rated movie. I did like a lot of the camera shots, like Raphael throwing his Sih at the arrow and breaking it in half. If you pop that into slow motion, you can see them switch shots at the last minute, great editing there. Comedy isn't fresh but it works, the wet willy was funny. Overall, a good, clean show of movie making fun, in this fair box-office movie. 42 million dollars, which i believe was the #1 movie of its genre that year, which is good in a few ways.
B000002J1S|5.0|The release date for the SACD version is April 18, 2005, at least in Europe. If you have the equipment, waiting would seem the wise decision. If you don't have the equipment now, SACDs will play on a standard CD player. The only issue is whether or not the new version will cost more (I doubt if it will be much more). While there is certainly nothing wrong with the recording quality of the original, the new version will almost certainly to be superior to a thirty-year old recording.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but it is arguably one of the smartest, savviest satires of its kind.  The Special Edition DVD set only drives that home with its wonderful commentary tracks and bonus features.<br /><br />Not afraid to laugh at themselves, the cast & filmmakers share their opinions and anecdotes about this unique, disturbing (dare I say it) art film.<br /><br />Edward Norton proves himself, yet again, as one of the finest talents of his generation and Brad Pitt keeps up with him every step of the way...all while satisfying the studio's expected beefcake quota.  Helena Bonham Carter, upon multiple screenings, displays incredible restraint in a seemingly over-the-top performance.  Art direction, cinematography, direction...all first class.<br /><br />Not a film to be taken at face value, definitely worth studying.  Maybe it will be part of a course in filmmaking and/or storytelling...it should be.
6305609705|5.0|Working at a movie theater I recently had an oppertunity to watch any movie I wanted on the big screen. Knowing that I would be quiting soon I needed to pick wisely because it would most likely be my last choice. After deciding against 2001 (without a 70mm print and proper equipment its just not the same) I chose Apocalypse Now. I have seen the movie countless times but only on the big screen do certain things become apparent, first just how menacing and genuinly scary Kurtz is, and two how unbelievably beautiful the film is. Vittorio Stararo's cinematography is akin to Gregg Toland's benchmark work on Citizen Kane, and Harold Rosson's sparkling technicolor on The wizard of Oz. Each scene in Apocalypse is like a surreal moving picture, a water color in motion. In the end Stararo does to jungle settings in Apocalypse what Freddie Young did to sand dunes in Lawrence of Arabia, bring them to life in a beautiful and unexpected way.  <br />  Whether or not you agree with the films philosophy, or find the idea of bringing Heart of Darkness to life in the form of a Vietnam drama absurd, you can't deny the films visual splendor and audacious ambition.  <br />
B000002MP2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this album. It came out when I was about 4, so most people my age probably don't know it exists. But I do, and I'm glad, because it instantly climbed to the top of my list for favorite CDs. I like American Idiot, but this is much, much better. I would recommend this above their other CDs if you are just getting into them.
B0007MVXQG|3.0|I'm starting to build up my album collection, so when I saw two copies left of Judas Priest's new CD \\"Angel of Retribution\\" at the store where I work, I quickly snatched a copy. I only knew two things: it was their first album with Rob in many years (ten to be exact), and they were renowned for being an influential heavy metal band. (Guns N' Roses is my favorite hard rock/metal group; I had heard they were partly influenced by Priest.) <br /> <br />Anyway, I was a bit unimpressed overall. First of all, I have to once again express my dislike for DualDisc. I first saw this format (or heard it!) with Nine Inch Nails' \\"The Downward Spiral.\\" I instantly thought it was annoying, from the slide-out dust sleeve (the CD case falls out of this VERY easily; my NIN CD case was smashed in because I grabbed the outer sleeve and the insides hit the floor!) to the clumsy and awkard \\"dualdisc\\" format where you have two sides to the album, one the music, the other DVD footage and a dolby 5.1 remixed surround track. <br /> <br />The problem with this DualDisc crap is that it would be far easier and more appropriate to simply include dual discs - plural - rather than just one disc with two sides. The European release of \\"Downward Spiral\\" was two discs. I'd prefer that. <br /> <br />Same with \\"Angel of Retribution.\\" Although the outer sleeve doesn't seem to slide around as much as previous ones have, it's still an annoying concept. <br /> <br />I know that's not a review of the album itself, but on Amazon I am reviewing the actual DualDisc CD (versus the DVD + CD edition) so I thought I'd mention that DualDisc is VERY annoying - because of the dual sides it's easy to smudge and get fingerprints on, like those old nasty MGM and WB DVDs with Widescreen and Fullscreen formats on each side (and the only thing more annoying than that is when you can't tell if the \\"widescreen\\" label means it's on the bottom or top, and vice versa - and if you've ever had one of these DVDs, you'll know exactly what I mean). <br /> <br />Anyway, onto the actual album itself, it has some good material, but with only ten tracks, few are exceptional in any way (if any). It may be the \\"original bad boys\\" but the fact is by today's standards they sound just like their mimickers - from the edgy guitar riffs to the Metallica-style lead vocals, which have been imitated far too often since the rise of Pantera. <br /> <br />A good album. I haven't heard all of the songs yet, at least not enough to give it a proper review. But on first listen I wasn't captivated (as I was with Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction). It's lacking cool riffs, memorable lyrics and so on and so forth - maybe with more listens I'll have a change of heart but so far I'm a bit disappointed.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Since I was a little girl, I've been transfixed by the power of Disney's Beauty and the Beast.  Unlike other Disney heroines, Belle is a true role model: a fiery, intelligent, independent woman who  falls in love because of the man's (or beast's) character not looks.  This movie is timeless and I love it as much now as a sophmore in high school as I did as a 5 year old who waltzed around in Belle's yellow dress every day for years.  Enjoy this exquisite gem of entertainment.
B000268QB2|5.0|Penny doesn't get all tingly when she hears new Anglo bands...they sound the same after a while. But these boys are different. In the UK the attempt is to push and export as much Brit music as possible since waining sales reached record highs in the last few years. Once in a while my ears perk up. <br />My boyfriend said \\"listen to this\\", and I immediately thought  \\" Ahhhhh, a sprinkle of  Coldplay and a full cup of Freddy Mercury....I'm in love\\" . <br />The songs are sensitive and well-written, except for a couple redundant lyrical blotches about \\" the other side\\" and \\" in the morning\\" and \\"cold hearts\\"...but hey, the kids in pain and he's just venting...it's okay Tom...and this too shall pass. 7 great songs on an album and you have the makings of a tough follow -up. This is inspiring music, well-sung and well-written..my favorite is the ethereal \\"untitled-1\\". No guitars in this band, but the bassist plays some high-notes in this dreamy, creamy tune, and you get your little \\"guitar fix\\" here as well...The rest are just strong balladacious songs, with great big juicy, wet choruses, filled with hope and a little fear. Some songs have more fear than others, however. <br />Go out and get this thing, for cripes sake...Penny orders you to buy this right now! <br /> <br />
B00000D9TQ|3.0|I have to admit, as cheesy and as offensive as Phil Collins is, the man could craft a pop tune.<br /><br />Blessed with a McCartney-esque gene, Collins was able to write a little ditty, cover someone else's, and make it snappy and listenable.  Granted, he had the same formula, the same instrumentation, the obsession with horn hits, vocal distortion to hide what I suspect is a weak voice, and a drum machine (though he was lauded as a drummer) but he put it together often enough and people bought it.<br /><br />Eventually, the formula wore out, but not before Collins pocketed half a billion bucks and moved to Switzerland, he an unabashed Tory.<br /><br />The disc should take care of any Collins fixation you might have.  The more seriously afflicted will check out his full solo albums for a full dosage of horn hits.
B00006879E|4.0|Four stars!!!! If it is 5 stars it will be perfect, no room for improvement on the second album, which will be the definitive(if not the jinx, as the usual superstition) album for any artist there is. Seriously, Adam's voice is not that brilliant but it sure fits the whole context of the album. I JUST CANNOT STOP CRANKING THIS ALBUM UP everytime I play it.Amazing!!! I still have 100%of my hearing (so far I had been listening to this for almost 2 years running, on my daily commute).Cannot wait for the sophomore album.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Before I begin my review I would like to say that I am a 15 year old classic rock freak writing reviews for my day. Know this just so you can get where I'm coming from. <br /> <br />Normally, bands now a days disgust me. Wether it's the terrible, suicidal lyrics, under par singing of uninspired live shows, there is plenty of junk to go around. One day my friend (also a classic rock freak) gave me this album. I had heard \\"Are you gonna be my Girl?\\" from the ipod commerical, and decided to give it a chance. I was happily surprised. <br /> <br />No doubt these guys have indeed ripped off Humble Pie, the Stones, and even The Who guitar lines. But that is whats so great. They provide a fresh new take on great bases. All throughout the album, wether it's the Beatles like ballads, or the aforementioned rock a likes, it is all clean and impressive. <br /> <br />An excellent album. Makes me glad that a band finally knows what is good music.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Unlike many of the reviewers I have not read Isaac Asimov's \\"I, Robot\\" stories.   Literature of any kind cannot be translated to a film without changes.  The only alternative is to shoot the entire book, which results in a film like Erich von Stroheim's Greed, intended to run for 8 hours.  Film makers have little choice but to make compromises.  Looking at the film on its own, I think that I, Robot is a great science fiction film.  <br /> <br />The place, Chicago in 2035, is a real look into the future and was planned that way by the director Alex Proyas.  The look of the city was designed as it might appear in the future with familiar old buildings and new futuristic designs.  Cars were designed especially for the film to present a logical representation of what people might be driving in 2035.  Altogether, the film presents a complete futuristic world down to the clothing people wear. The story has mystery and suspense and is nicely paced.  The special effects, particularly the robots, were designed to make them believable and not just for a splashy look.  The actors who played the robots were taught to walk and act as a robot.   <br /> <br />Will Smith does a great job playing the brooding Detective Spooner. I tend to think of Mr. Smith as a comedic actor but he has proven he can handle dramatic roles and in I, Robot he gives his character the right edginess and demeanor.  His distrust of robots comes through without overstatement.  Perhaps Smith's shooting from an airborne motorcycle is a little hard to believe but not impossible, and don't we want a movie to have some excitement. Bridget Moynahan is well cast as Susan Calvin, who designs robots to appear more human and has a gradual transformation from her belief that robots are entirely benign (Ms. Moynahan also has a miraculous shooting sequence, firing a weapon with her eyes closed and hitting only a robot).  Alan Tudyk provides a sensitive performance as Sonny the robot.  We never see Mr. Tudyk's face but his movements and voice make Sonny a real and sympathetic character.  Unfortunately, James Cromwell's character, Dr. Alfred Lanning, dies at the start of the film so we see him only briefly in messages he recorded before his death.  The only significant extra on the DVD is a short piece on \\"Making of I, Robot.\\"  This has the standard interviews with the stars, director, writers and special effects personnel that gives a good overview of how the film was made and what the director and producers were aiming for in making the film.  By the standards of many DVDs the extras are skimpy for I, Robot.  <br /> <br />I found I, Robot to be an engrossing film where you care about the characters and are intrigued by the story.  The look of the film is fabulous and takes you into this world of the future in a similar way that Total Recall made Mars a believable place. Highly recommend.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is, without question, the sleeper comedy of the year. Influenced by Wes Anderson's &quot;Rushmore&quot; and Paul Feig's &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;, Napoleon Dynamite is a study in isolation that clearly distances itself from the two. Napoleon, played by newcomer Jon Herder, is a quirky geek from rural Idaho who, like many before him within the genre, has problems relating to others. His obvious disregard for the way in which others view him, including the audience, isolates him further. The fact is that Napoleon Dynamite is a character study that never actually studies a character. <br />It nestles itself within the genre of alienated teen comedy by taking 85 minutes to deliver and repeat a one liner. Situations present themselves whereby Napoleon is put on the spot. His obvious disregard for how others receive his words deliver the joke, as there are no consequences for his action. Things here stay stagnant, a journey that takes us nowhere except to the realization that we are laughing out loud, situation after situation. <BR>What distinguishes this film from others within the genre is that there is no revenge from this nerd; there isn't even any change in his disposition. Rather, Jared Hess takes us through a week in the life of a geek leading up to the prom. The anxiety pertaining to this, as seen in so many other films, is totally underdeveloped, which works. <br />To suggest that Napoleon is comfortable with the way he handles himself is an understatement, but i guess that is fitting since this film is a total understatement. Despite being the center of attention, he does not allow a possible error in judgment to affect him. The audience laughs at him the same way his onscreen peers laugh at him. Napoleon remains unshaken, it truly doesn't stir him. <br />Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy that is quirky enough to keep you entertained from start to finish, even though you end up in exactly the same place.

0790729601|3.0|Eraser features Arnold Schwarzenegger as a government operative who makes witnesses disappear or get \\"Erased\\" Unfortunately the only thing that needed to be \\"Erased\\" was the second half of the screenplay. Eraser devolves from an intriguing story about witness protection into a by the numbers action movie not worthy of Mr. Schwarzenegger's limited talents.  This film belongs in the category of \\"Lesser Schwarzenegger, films those mediocre movies made after \\"True Lies\\" and before \\"Last action Hero\\"<br /><br />I can't fault Arnold here. He plays his part of Jack the \\"Eraser\\" very well. The action in the opening scenes is tight. But Eraser's problems all come from the dull, by the numbers screenplay. It's so by-the predictable you have the whole movie figured out by the opening credits. The guy's name is Jack like every other action hero. He's a government agent. He's got to protect the pretty female who knows something that the bad guys don't want told. One of the guys Jack works with is a Rogue agent. Jack will spend the film trying to figure out who he is even though we knew a half hour ago. There will be explosions, deaths, and the top bad guy will get his in the end in a memorable fashion after Ah-nold spouts a clich&eacute; we're all supposed to remember.<br /><br />There are some bright spots in this formulaic movie though. Vanessa Williams gives a solid performance as the witness Schwarzenegger is supposed to protect. She plays her part with intelligence and sophistication, making more out of her character than what was on the page. The former Miss America holds her own with Schwarzenegger, having great chemistry with him in all her scenes and keeps the film from falling apart. Robert Pastorelli from \\"Murphy Brown\\" is fun to watch as a mobster indebted to Jack. James Caan is well, James Caan. He's playing what he plays in most every movie he's in lately, the veteran government agent whose gone rogue. He's going to meet his in the end.<br /><br />Eraser is an OK movie worth a rental on a rainy night. The actors keep this uninspired action movie from turning into Last Action Hero.ental on a rainy night. The actors keep this uninspired action movie from turning into Last Action Hero.  <br />
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I thought Capturing the Friedman's should have won the Best Documentary Oscar until I saw Fog of War.  If you are thinking about staying home this weekend and want to watch a film that gets you thinking, then Errol Morris' Fog of War is your best bet. Winner of the 2003 Academy Award for best Documentary Feature, Fog of War documents Robert McNamara, U.S. Secretary of State under Kennedy and Johnson, and his recollection of everything from his tenure as President of Ford Motors, to his involvement, as an advisor, in the foreign policy and subsequent standoff of the Cuban Missile Crisis. <br />Fog of War uses archival and interview footage with McNamara to explain the eleven lessons he learned from his time working as Secretary of State. His political savvy is captured onscreen as he brings the viewers up to speed on some of the historical decisions he helped foster, the results to which saw him become the President of the World Bank. <br /> Fog of War acts as a reminder of the importance of past political decisions in a more comprehensive and constructive way thank Michael Moore is capable of.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Several months have passed since the events chronicled in The Wizard Of Oz, and Dorothy has returned safely home to Kansas.  Unfortunately, she can't get any sleep at night because she thinks her friends back in Oz are in trouble and everyone thinks Dorothy is insane for talking about a place that they don't believe exists.  When Dorothy finds a key with the letters \\"O\\" and \\"Z\\" on it, she thinks it's a key from Oz that was sent to her as a sign her friends are in trouble.  Her family finally decides that enough is enough and sends Dorothy to a mental hospital to undergo shock therapy in order to erase Dorothy's memories of Oz so she can sleep again.  But the hospital abuses their patients, so with the help of a mysterious young girl, Dorothy is able to escape only to find herself in a flooding river.  Dorothy finds a chicken coop that she can safely fall asleep in, but when she awakes, she finds herself back in the land of Oz with her pet chicken, Billina, who now has the ability to speak.  But all isn't well like it was before.  The Yellow Brick Road has been destroyed, everyone in the Emerald City has been turned to stone (including the Tinman and the Cowardly Lion), and the Scarecrow and the ruby slippers have both been taken by the sinister Nome King.  Now, together with her new friends, Billina; the robot, Tik-Tok; the talking pumpkin, Jack Pumpkinhead; and the magical creature, the Gump, Dorothy must embark on a journey to the Nome King's mountain to defeat him, rescue the Scarecrow, get back the ruby slippers, and save the land of Oz.   <br /> <br />Return To Oz is a sequel to The Wizard Of Oz which was first produced in the '80s by Disney.  Unfortunately, this movie isn't as popular as the first film, mainly because people were watching it expecting it to be exactly like The Wizard Of Oz.  It's impossible for anyone to recreate the exact same magical feel the Judy Garland classic gave audiences for over a century, but what many people don't know is that TheWizard Of Oz is actually based on a book that was first written by L. Frank Baum in 1900, and the MGM movie actually made a lot of changes from the original storyline.  The book was actually a lot more darker than the first movie and even a little bit violent (although nothing overly-gratitious ever occurs), but MGM cut all of this out when they produced the movie version of The Wizard Of Oz.  However, Return To Oz is actually a lot more faithful to the original Oz books which it is based upon (The Marvelous Land Of Oz and Ozma Of Oz).  But because so many people have only seen the Judy Garland version of Oz, when they finally see what the \\"real\\" Oz is like, they hate it because it's not what they grew up with and this is mainly why Return To Oz didn't perform so well in theaters.  Also, a lot of parents complained that this movie was too scary for little kids, but this is why this movie is rated PG rather than G.   <br /> <br />Return To Oz certainly isn't anything like The Wizard Of Oz, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie.  On the contrary, it has a wonderful story with a lot of unique characters and Disney gets pretty creative in this film with the whole \\"Oz is just a dream\\" plot MGM introduced to the movie version of The Wizard of Oz.  It also features a lot of elaborate costumes and sets and the claymation effects really work well with a fantasy film like this.  It actually works better than today's CGI effects because the actors actually have something to work with when using claymation, so everything looks more realistic.  This movie also proves that Oz isn't just for little kids and can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages, so the darker storyline can help older fans rekindle their interest in the land of Oz.  Unfortunately, this DVD release leaves much left to be desired.  Disney made abosuletly zero efforts to restore the quality on this disc, so the picture quality looks very grainy, especially towards the beginning of the film.  The audio is also a little low on this movie compared to most other DVDs and this DVD release is seriously lacking in the extras department.  The only bonus features you actually get are an interview with Fairuza Balk (the actress who portrays Dorothy perfectly in this movie) and a collection of the film's theateritical and commericial trailers.   <br /> <br />While these certainly are nice extras, it would've been nicer if they had also included interviews with the rest of the cast, an interview with Walter Murch (the director of this film), and an interview with David Shire (who composed the movie's beautiful musical score).  Apparently, there was a behind-the-scenes special that was produced for this movie, but for reasons unknown it was never included on the actual DVD.  It's a shame that it didn't because it would've made for a really neat extra and it also would've been nice to have some deleted scenes included, too.  But even this mediocre DVD release doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the actual film any.  While Return To Oz may not be a timeless classic or is anything like The Wizard Of Oz, it is a pure fantasy story at it's best that any Oz fan can enjoy as long as you don't try to compare it to The Wizard Of Oz.  Parents of younger children who are sensitive or easily scared may want to take caution with this film though, as it really pushes its PG rating.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|First of all, I got a few things to say about some of the other reviews.  I noticed, the first day this came out, that about half the reviews of it said it was the 'Best Album Ever'.  I got nothing against such a belief, but I sure as hell don't trust anyone who's willing to declare something the best album ever the first day it was released, particularly a 76 minute one.  Hell, an album like this you need to listen to at least half a dozen times before you can really think you're ready to review it, and I seriously doubt most of those people listened to it more than a few times.  Second of all, this is a fairly distinctive, original work, but it's hardly earth-shattering, as so many others would have you believe.  The whole jazzy jamming, electronic interlude, genre-hopping style of music has been around for a very long time now.  The Mars Volta put a fairly distinct spin out it, but they're working in an established genre.  It's a great album, but it's not revolutionizing the world of rock.  Still, all this is pretty funny, in a way.  It took nearly 30 years, but the indie and punk communities finally decided that prog-rock was the greatest thing ever, after all.(This may make it sound like I'm primarily a prog fan- I'm not.  I'm a metalhead, almost exclusively, which I suppose gives me a different perspective than the vast majority of the other reviewers.)<br /><br />All that aside, this is a great album, and most people who enjoyed 'De-Loused in the Comatorium' will enjoy this.  No, it doesn't sound exactly the same as 'De-Loused...' but I don't recall ever being promised that it would.  And no, I don't like it as much as 'De-Loused...' either, but it's not too huge of a gap, and it definitely expands and redefines The Mars Volta sound in a interesting way.  Their older, post-hardcore styling has been quite substantially reduced, though it hasn't yet disappeared entirely.  Though the latin and prog and jazz and other elements are quite interesting, I certainly hope they don't ever loose the hardcore flavor entirely.  It's the key to the whole thing.  Use of interludes and jamming has increased. I don't mind the jamming, it's usually very entertaining, but sometimes the interludes are a bit excessive.  They aren't so much boring as they just fail to add anything to the songs after a certain point.<br /><br />There are 5 songs here, and they're all good.  It opens with `Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus' which is probably the track which  is most reminiscent of their earlier work.  It's plenty energetic, with weaving, funky guitars and dense percussion, and passionate, inspired vox from Cedric.  Still, the best part of the track would have to be the mellow, jazzy middle break with what is probably the most inspired guitar solo on the album.  The electronic/sample driven outro goes on a bit too long, I think, but it really doesn't hurt it very much overall.  `The Widow' is the only really short piece, about 3 1/2 minutes long before the extensive interlude.  Again, the interlude isn't all that exciting, but the main song is excellent.  It's a bit slower, more balladish, and with some very effective use of horns and a powerful chorus.  `L'Via L'Viaquez' is probably my favorite track.  It combines hardcore with latin flavoring sections with slower, melancholic Caribbean dance parts.  It's a weird combination, but it works, and while it goes on for quite a while, it never really peters out or loses interest due to some nice leadwork throughout the latter portions of the song, both from guitar and piano.  `Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore', is another more balladish piece.  It opens very slowly, with about 4 minutes of somewhat Godspeed You Black Emperor! esque post-rock, which eventually gives way to horn and acoustic guitar driven material.  The vox are strong, again, some of Cedric's most powerful, and the manage close the song out effectively again, with lots of nice trumpet leadwork in the latter portions of the song.  `Cassandra Gemini' is about 32 minutes long, and it is arguably the least impressive thing here, though it is very good.  It opens up as a fairly typical Mars Volta track, with an excellent, very memorable chorus, but moves on to a bunch of extended instrumental sections.  It does manage to change it up a bit, as it moves from an uptempo, energetic section with lots of vox to a slower, horn-driven section to a subdued, jazzy part with mostly whispered vox to a finally purely instrumental, occasionally minimalistic movement before finally kicking it back up and bringing the chorus back.  Everything in this song is interesting, with a ton of fine guitar solos and some more excellent horns, but it is rarely truly striking.  It sounds very nice, but it rarely moves you the way that the first 4 tracks did, and the way that The Mars Volta typically can when they use some relatively conventional songwriting.  Still, a very good song.<br /><br />Yeah that's it.  Get it.`Cassandra Gemini' is about 32 minutes long, and it is arguably the least impressive thing here, though it is very good.

B00005JKC3|1.0|I saw this peice of crap in the movie theatures when it first came out. This film is a complete discrase to the comic book and even the cinamatic. \\"The Hulk\\" now replaces \\"Howard The Duck\\" as the worst movie of all time. if you buy this you are wasting your money, just as i am wasting my time writing this article. <br />The movie was slow and tedious, and to the person who said this movie is violent i beg to differ. How can something so CGI animated be violent. If they had anymore crappy CGI animation i would confuse this movie with \\"Shrek\\". In closing, don't watch this movie because it is a utter worthless peice of crap. and when the sequel comes out i will personaly burn down the movie theature so no one will have to veiw a second hulk movie. <br />                             -Dr. Dyslexia
B00006M183|4.0|The album is very good. However, sometimes I do miss the old Pearl Jam. Imagine if they made more videos for their songs over the past ten years. What I am getting at is they could have maintained their dominance like in the early 90's. But, its not about that, it's about the music and the music is not as good as the early material, case closed. I do give Pearl Jam credit for selling out arenas still and putting out good material. I do miss songs like I Got Id and Yellow Ledbetter because that quality of writing will never happen again. Songs like, Black, Jeremy, Alive, Betterman, and Even Flow put them on the map. Those days are over. Don't get me wrong I think this album is great and I also Love Yield and No Code. But, Ten is still their best album along with Vitalogy and V.S. I compliment Pearl Jam by saying their music went downhill because their music is still great. But, thats how awesome their old material was. Pearl Jam is still probably my favorite band.
1402541805|5.0|Sitting on the edge of the Kalahari sipping bush tea or trundling about in a tiny white van was not something I had ever before contemplated.  Nor had I considered African witch doctors.  Alexander McCall Smith takes the reader into modern day Botswana and introduces us to Precious Ramotswe, owner of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency.  A \\"traditionally built\\" woman, with a reverence for her native country and its customs, Mme. Ramotswe is a long way from the lady detectives on television.  The language is poetic and charm of this book lies in the simplicity of the writing and well crafted intuitions and observations of Mme. Ramotswe.  With gentility and common sense, Precious Ramotswe finds the solutions to an assortment of predicaments .<br /><br />The writing is inspired, the setting is vivid and the characters are elegantly believable.  The book was finished long before this reader was ready to leave Botswana behind.  Happily this is the first in a series.  Let me also highly recommend the recorded version (unabridged, of course), read in musical South African accent by Lissette Lecat.  This book (and series) should delight all ages.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Being tremendously frustrated with current music I decided to finally give Radiohead a chance and see what all the fuss is about. The Bends was my introduction.  I picked it up and immediately loved it.  A while later I tried OK.  I didn't know what to think- it was so different.  A after a few listens though, I got it.  It's perfect.  I have a hard time ranking the songs because they are all part of the whole piece, but Let Down and Karma Police instantly stood out. Now my favorite is Climbing Up the Walls but it changes weekly.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I never in a million years would have thought I'd own a Christina Aguilera album let alone like it no thats wrong i love it! Christina not only proves she's got vocal chops but also proves that there is a woman a real woman with thoughts, points of views and real hardcore heartbreak in her journey. She proves once and for all she's the one that will have the career with longevity as opposed to that white trash fembot Britney who is fading fast from the collective with the boy bands of yore. This album contains party tracks \\"diirty\\" ballads \\"beautiful\\" songs of empowerment \\"cruz\\" \\"soar\\" and a song about the domestic violence she witnessed as a child, if you're not moved by that one you just don't have heart.Buy this one it will shock you for all the right reasons.
B0007P3582|1.0|I think with this album the hip hop gods will finally realize how foolish they were for ever giving 50 a mic to spit on.  Without even having to listen to the album, and just by watching MTV, you could just tell that the album was gunna be a bust.  Candy Shop, the first single of the album, shows that 50 rather use his image and dreery club beats to sell records rather than using his rhymes, or lack there of.  Then 50 gets in front of the camera with hip hop radio godfather Sway and tries to tell us that his new album is suppossed to be better than his first knowing that it would be impossible to outdo the success of Get Rich Or Die Trying. <br />Actually listening to the album I realized that The Masacre would be great if 50 would just shut his mouth and let the rest of the Aftermath family do the talking.  There are some nice beats in 77 minutes of listening, but nothing good enough to cover up 50 Cent's monotone rhyme schemes and lack of lyrical content.  My favorite track on the disc is \\"Piggy Bank\\" because I know that it will inspire another classic diss track from Nas to drop this summer destroying 50 and giving me something to bump when I roll up next to a bunch of white kids in a Civic Or Mustang pumping 50's garbage LP through some blown stock speakers.  I'm glad I didn't waste the money to buy this album, and anyone who did purchase it needs to return it before they take the plastic off.  If it has already been unwrapped, don't worry I'm sure you'll be able to sell or trade it to your local record shop.
0156027321|5.0|I love it! <br /> <br />the story is almost real, and yet it's surreal! <br />How Pi struggled on a lifeboat with big bengal-tiger, Richard Parker in a wide-open ocean for months. How his strong drive to survive made him do whatever he never thought he would do, to stay alive. Each chapter makes me wonder, what it's like to be made into movie? When i'm reading it, I feel like I'm actually there with Pi, feel his thirst, his hunger, his fear, his love, his joy... I shed my tears when Pi told Richard Parker he loves him so much, and when Richard Parker left him. <br /> <br />This book for me has good values of life. Its purpose is not to make you believe there's God or whatever, but I do believe Pi won't survive if God didn't allow him to survive.  <br />At the end, I prefer to believe the story with the animals, of course. <br /> <br />I put this book next to The Alchemist and The Little Prince. Classic story I would tell my children.

1400082773|5.0|Senator Obama is a \\"truth teller\\" who has taken us yet another step further down the path to understanding who we Americans really are as a people. His version of the truth is not an unfamiliar one but IS one told with much grace and style.<br /><br />Barack's family odyssey is a magic carpet ride through space and time; across color lines into different cultures, backgrounds and walks of life, a literary daydream that traipse the globe at the speed of life but that finally and abruptly returns us full circle back to ground zero and ground truth: to the ghettos of Chicago, the housing projects, Altgeld, which, in so many ways, is but a symbolic leitmotif of a world that seem systematically to be losing what remains of its humanity.<br /><br />One can try to decipher and then argue about the motives for such a book: to exorcise the demons of the timelessly troubled father-son dynamic (or through Freudian interpolation, the equally troubled mother-son dynamic); to unfurl the internal pain, isolation, alienation and uncertainty of having no choice in being flung into a racially bifurcated life in a land where pretenses about racial pedigree seem to be all that really matters; to show that no matter where you land in this world, race does indeed matter -- especially if you are young, Black and male; or that a good education and a commitment to something larger than oneself are the true equalizers in a world of irretrievably distorted and declining values, and ever-diminishing humanity.<br /><br />Take you pick, whatever is your final answer you will discover that Obama's motives touch his humanity in places and in ways that make us all think more deeply and feel more human; and they always remain complex and compelling. For these universal reasons, the book will endure and deserves a place along side such classics as Alex Haley's Roots.<br /><br />Beyond the text itself the book has a deeper and somewhat more unsettling meaning. Because if Obama does nothing else he shows us that his life is an object lesson in what it means to be an aware citizen of this world.  If he does nothing more he proves that he knows his way around; that he knows the score. He has earned a right to have his views heard. But too much awareness in this world can be a dangerous and unsettling thing.<br /><br />The lessons of Hawaii, Indonesia, Chicago, New York, Harvard and Kenya is that realities and truths of this life will either hit you in the face or in \\"the behind:\\" there is no place to hide; no place for feigned innocence; no place for fantasy or denial. As the book puts it (on page 204) \\"Black survival in this country has always been premised on a minimum of delusions...\\"<br /><br />As uncomfortable as straddling the fence of the racial divide has been, it has taught Obama some cruel but very necessary lessons:<br /><br />Chicago taught him that there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow coalition. In most of the known world self-interest, issues, and religiously motivated action is supposed to lead directly to power.  But not so in Chicago. In the ghetto, fear trumps everything including religious values and morals. Fear, poverty and racism degrades in incalculatable and immeasurable ways.<br /><br />Indonesia taught him that even though power in the U.S. is hidden under a veneer of insincere platitudes, political correctness, pseudo-patriotism and pseudo-relgiousity, benign neglect and other forms of state sanctioned hypocrisy, which makes the use of power seem almost people-friendly; it is not so in the Third world.  There, are no pretenses. Power is raw, undisguised, indiscriminate and arbitrary.  The only way to make peace with power in the Third World is to hand over your humanity or your life.  There are no subtleties, no nuances, no political correctness, no substitutes, and no margin for error.  In the Third world, Barack's stepfather Lolo showed that you can't beat the system by playing the angles and operating independently aroundthe margins.  No. Appeals to moral suasion do not work; logic doesn't work either.  The choices are nepotism, revolution or a life of permanent oppression, poverty and quiet despair existing as a lower form of humanity.<br /><br />Kenya taught him that there is an ironclad law of human nature: Even when Blacks win, they always lose.  Just as Post-Reconstruction turned newly-won freedom into a new kind of slavery for Black Americans, so too did independence turn Black Africa into a continuation of colonialism by other means. There too, as in America, can be found Uncle Toms, compromisers, the lackeys of the white dying colonial power structure and Black hypocrites who will sell their souls for a dollar.  Across the Third World, as on the streets of Detroit and Chicago, the echo chamber of poverty and despair can be heard in neighborhoods with too many single Black women having too many unwanted babies, with too few fathers; and in large cities there are too many idle young men of color without the means to become productive citizens.  These men know how to act even when they do not know how to be.<br /><br />In New York he learned that racism, sexism and class are all different sides of the same old chauvinistic coin. Everybody talks about their pet \\"ism\\" but no one does a thing about any of them -- especially not about the deep reservoir of racism that lies seething just beneath that city's consciousness.<br /><br />The book's ultimate truth is that Barack knows that his own \\"individual advancement,\\" no matter how high he might eventually rise, is unlikely to affect the \\"collective decline\\" of the Black race in America.  And if he had not learned that through his own experiences, all he needed to do was to observe the impotency of the likes of Clarence Thomas, Colin (and Michael) Powell, or Condoleeza Rice, and their individual or collective ability to affect the Black condition.<br /><br />As Frank (one of Barack's streetwise mentors) warned him: At Harvard you will have to check your race at the door where you will then be \\"trained\\" rather than \\"educated\\" receiving at the end of your term an \\"advanced degree in compromise.\\" If the above list of \\"well-trained\\" Black leaders is any indication, Obama can expect the U.S. Congress, to be a continuation of the \\"training\\" Frank warned him about.<br /><br />Now that Senator Obama has arrived at the citadel of American power, the U.S. Senate, whether fair or not, this book will be seen as his moral compass; his contract with us -- America; the manifesto of his philosophy of life, a virtual instruction manual for understanding what makes Obama tick: It will be the yardstick against which the new Senator's actions will be measured: In the end we will all see it as the Truth According to Barack Obama.<br /><br />Fair or not, Illinois' newest Senator will be judged by the contents of this book, and by the values and techniques he has laid out in it.<br /><br />He, like the other Junior Senator-the one from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton (who incidentally is also from the Chicago area) has now been sucked into the orbit of the ultimate realm of power, into the cosmic political Black hole of the last standing superpower, where all history begins and ends and where the gravitational pull towards corruption, hypocrisy and \\"selling out\\" to corporate interests seems to have no known bounds. [And so far, no one who has entered has escaped with their morals intact.]<br /><br />The orgy of conservative extremist power that rules Congress today, jeers at the weak; has commandeered all the symbols of religion and state, and has taken over the moral high ground by fiat. It eats its young and takes no prisoners.  There is no friendly turf remaining on which neophytes such as Obama can stand his ground.  The inmates are running the asylum.<br /><br />Even today as we watch the ugly spectacle of the transformation of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ever-\\"triangulating\\" her way down to the least commondenominator to meet the ever-downward demands of the more popular American center, we can literally see her shedding her old democratic values and redefining them downwards to meet the more popular demands of the mindlessly, racist, amoral American center, in her unholy licentious quest for the Crown Jewel of American politics, the American Presidency.<br /><br />Those of us who knew her before she became a rich author, a shamed ex-First lady and a feminist media star, wonder what happened to the ex-warrior for the weak; the outspoken radical who while in college single-handedly took on the establishment status quo? How soon we find new gods to serve and new ways to rationalize that service and our new existence.<br /><br />The same eyes that are watching the moral disintegration of Hillary will also be fixed on Senator Obama's every move.  What will he do?  Will the system eat him alive, or will it change him as it has changed Hillary, or will he change it? Will he continue to support those who fight in the trenches or will he grab the money and glory and run.<br /><br />That is the question this book cannot answer.  Five stars.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|There are all kinds of flavors on this album, spanning Sad Wings to Painkiller in terms of style. Talk about a welcome return to form! I don't think the Priest has recorded an album equal to this since Defenders of the Faith, quite honestly. It's that good. <br /> <br />\\"Judas Rising\\", \\"Demonizer\\", and \\"Hellrider\\" epitomize the over-the-top metal mayhem Priest are famous for. I fully expected songs like these, and I was not disappointed! Other pleasant predictables are \\"Deal With The Devil\\", \\"Revolution\\", and \\"Wheels of Fire\\". While not the best songs on the album, they are solid compositions, reminiscent of Priest's early 80's work. \\"Worth Waiting For\\" is a distant relative of songs like \\"Desert Plains\\" and \\"Fever\\", and is also a great composition.  <br /> <br />Where I was pleasantly surprised was toward the back end of the album, with tunes like \\"Angel\\" and \\"Eulogy\\". These songs are modern cousins of the dirges once found only on \\"Rocka Rolla\\", \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" and \\"Sin After Sin\\". Priest haven't recorded songs like these for nearly 30 years, and I'm happy that they've finally recognized the genius of their early work. <br /> <br />This is a brave album. Priest could've simply given us an all-out metal assault, and I would've eaten it up. They went the extra mile, however, and gave us some truly haunting numbers that pay justice to their long, diverse history. They've still got it!
0060763280|5.0|Then I reread the book and realized that I needed to take action and make things happen. That's when I started seeing results. <br /> <br />If you just read the book and then go watch TV nothing will happen, folks.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|As for the music...this is classic Priest. Great to hear Halford back in the group. As for the U.S. cd releases, well, they both were less than satisfactory. Unlike some reviewers, my star rating is for hte music, not the CD issues. Most of you notice that there are two versions of this album available. There is a \\"dueldisc\\" edition and a limited \\"hardcover\\" book edition. The \\"dueldisc\\" version generates more problems. This is a new type of technology that is still in the working process and there is even a warning on the CD case. The disc features the music portion on one side and a the DVD features on the other. Because of this, the CD is thicker than the usual CD. Since it is thicker, the cd has a hard time playing in a lot of CD players. Forget about playing it in your CD deck in your car. Alot of players also scratch up the DVD side when trying to play the music side. I know a lot of people like myself like to make copies of our CD's so we can play 'em in our cars without worry of ruining the original discs. Forget about that as the new copy protection makes this impossible. Overall, the \\"dueldisc\\" edition blows and should be avoided. People wanting to avoid all the hassle of the ultra-garbage dueldisc version are better off buying the limited hardcover book edition. This has the CD and DVD on seperate discs. You are also able to make back-up copies of the CD for your car with this one. The downfalls of this release is that the CD and DVD come in little slipcases inside the 'book'. This means that if you keep removing the discs, you have a chance of damaging them. I even know a few individuals whose discs came pre-scratched because of these slipcases. The hardcover book is also only slightly better than those dreaded digipacks as it can get ruined very easily. Still, even with its downfalls, the limited is by far the way to go. If only they released it in a regular double jewel case instead...
B0007P3582|5.0|First of all just wanna say this.... Everyone who disses this CD needs their ears checked. It's not quite like his first CD but great but did expect that. He has matured and this CD proves it. The beats are sick and his flow is up there with eminem. So I don't see a problem. If you really like rap this is a CD you will love. Bottom line add this to your CD collection. And leave this GREAT artist alone. If you can do better go for it if not shut the f*c* up.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I watched Napoleon Dynamite for the first time on a plane. Not expecting much from inflight movies, I wondered what I had stumbled onto. Within moments I was cracking up with laughter, thinking \\" you gotta be kidding \\". A passenger seated next to me (who appeared to be quite conservative) also started to let out spontaneous fits of laughter. So there we were snug in cattle class seats with headphones on wiping  consious tears from our faces and trying to stop ourselves from breaking into uncontollable asylum entrance laughter.
B000001DYY|5.0|Roland's first outing after the 'breakup' of Tears For Fears (or, more precisely, Curt Smith's departure due to creative differences) finds him teaming up with Alan Griffiths, who would become the silent 'other half' of what the band would become throughout the 90s.  Freed from the confines of his partnership with Smith, Orzabal explores more personal territory with a decidedly more contemporary feel; the production here is outstanding and the lyrics poignant as they are beautiful - just listen to the title track for evidence, which builds into an updated Beatles-esque boullabaise by its climax.  No wonder they were all over college radio again when this was released in 93; and, having said that, the album suffers little in its 12 years of aging - I've had to purchase it three times on two different formats, but it has never been far from my stereo in the last decade or so. <br /> <br />While I applaud the much-publicized (yet surprisingly unpopular) reunion album from last year, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending (yes, it's great to hear those two voices cover new material again), I'll always hold firm that TFF did its best work sans Smith.
B0007O38F8|1.0|the cd is very bad. It has no flow, the lyrics asre stypid, the images are bad.........everything is bad only 3 songs are good ...13..19...22 !!!!!! IF YOU LIKED GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN` DON`T BUY THIS CD !!!!!
B0007Y08II|2.0|I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone out did themselves on this project. I admit they did an awesome job on the whole movie with the choreographed action scenes but what the hell is up with the puppet sex and the 2 minute puking. It was South Park but in puppet version but I didnt like it that much. Though I thought the fact that the bad guy was Kim Jon Il was hilarious and his puppet is awesome and him singing a song was better. The Team America theme song was funny too and also that fact that they made those celebrity puppets and killed them all was a riot as well. Best parts are all with the Kim Jon Il puppet. Very, very offense in everyway and if you can handle that sort of thing it's fine but sensitive people beware, this is not a rejected episode of Thunderbirds its way different. Good luck.

B000002U9W|5.0|This album is one of my favorit Pink Floyd Albums. One thing I like about it is that its like a CD were you can just relax and if your stressed out, you can just play this album and it seems to make things better. <br /> <br />1. Atom Heart Mother) this song is long, but very good. The bass and the weird vocals are really cool. A very trippy song. <br /> <br />2. If) very relaxing and very good song <br /> <br />3. Summer 68') I think is one of the best songs on the album. The horns in this song are awsome! <br /> <br />4. Fat Old Sun) another relaxing song. I think this song is the 2nd best. <br /> <br />5. Alans Psychedelic Breakfest) weird song. The piano is really good.
B000286RNY|4.0|After reading reviews about this film and missing the chance to see it on the big screen, I was finally able to rent this and was not disappointed. This film does not take itself seriosly and neither should the viewer. Lots of scenes that will make you go \\"what the...?\\" Particularly involving the one shaolin brother who loves eating too much and the egg that is used to help his soccer training. Loved it and will see it again!
B000002BHE|5.0|2 B frank, this is the 1st time 4 me 2 write a review, 'cause in my mind, doing reviews equals wasting time. But I have 2 rate 4 this album. Knowing nothing is perfect, I would give, 2 B exact,a 4.5 to this album(acutally this is the highest rank that I could possibly give).This is, in my opinion,the BEST album of Celine.Trust me, this comment is pretty objective,'cause it comes after my purchasing and listening all of her albums(French&English). <br />When Celine sings, she pours all of her emotions and sentiments in2 songs, and that's the reason Y her works always possess the power 2 touch our hearts, and this album is a good reflection. Her voice is like an angel's, so pure and so touching, sometimes like whiper of a brook,sometimes like eruption of a volcano.Thanks 2 her passion which controls the change and the transition so wonderfully. <br />Several No. 1s and some classic songs in this album, which make the album better. <br />OK,in brief, try this 1!Even if U like other genres of music, this disc is worth a try.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This is a great CD that shows the span of Shania's career. Every hit is included on here. So, there is not much to say. Everyone knows the songs, it's nice to have it on one disc. It starts from the most recent CD and goes backwards to her early stuff.<br /><br />My only complaint are the new songs: \\"Party For Two\\" (I think it is such a cheesy song\\" and \\"I Aint No Quitter\\" (this song is just horrible). But, luckily they are at the end of the CD so you can still enjoy her hits and then just stop it after those are done  LOL. Anyone who likes Shania and likes her music will for sure enjoy this CD. Every hit is on here.
B00004WKII|5.0|As mentioned, this is not for the person new to Hendrix.  There's plenty of 'greatest hits' packages for that.  With that said, if you are a fan you absolutely MUST have this box set.  I just got it and it blew me away!  Some really incredible guitar as you'd expect from Hendrix.  Several tunes that I had not heard before, but are already favorites.  An instrumental \\"Bold as Love\\", a scorching version of \\"Room Full of Mirrors\\", \\"Catfish Blues\\" and \\"Come Down Hard on Me\\" are just a few of the incredible songs on this set.  Like I said, this is for Hendrix fans.  Much better than the other collections of odds and ends that are available.  This one has mostly polished numbers and great live cuts.  I dumped it into my IPod and have been in Hendrix heaven since getting it in the mail.  Buy it!!  Read the other reviews for more details.  I think everyone gave it 5 stars... should be 20 stars since all 4 discs are incredible.
B000002MY3|5.0|I'm the kind of person who's usually into Shania Twain and the Partridge Family, but with Alanis, I felt like I could just scream along with her lyrics. I get this rush of empowerment whenever I hear her--she's just awesome. Just get this album. It's awesome.
B0006399FS|2.0|I had high hopes for this album with the return of veteran U2 producer Steve Lillywhite.  However, I was sadly disappointed.  There are maybe three good songs on this album.  The rest are just unlistenable.  All That You Can't Leave Behind was such a great refresher after the disappointing POP.  While this album continues in the ATYCLB vein, it doesn't even approach the melodic or lyrical quality of that album.  I'm glad I didn't waste any more money on concert tickets to see this stuff live!
B00003CXD0|5.0|Considered one of the funniest movies made, TOOTSIE after 20+ years still achieves that honor.  Dustin Hoffman in a role that should have won him an Oscar is brilliant; his transition from Michael Dorsey to Dorothy Michaels is so well done that it's hard to believe he's not a woman.  His handling of the typical feminine prejudices is wonderful and his suffering in his longing for Jessica Lange (in a deserved supporting actress Oscar role) is touching.  TOOTSIE works on all levels:  as a statement of how women were treated then; as a statement that just because men dress up like women, they aren't gay; and what a brilliant cast that supports Hoffman and Lange:  Syndey Pollack (the movie's director) as Hoffman's agent; Bill Murray in his superbly understated role as Hoffman's roommate and playwright friend; the marvelous Teri Garr (she was also nominated) as his best friend and one time lover; Charles Durning as Lange's father who falls in love with Dorothy; George Gaynes as the sexcrazed daytime drama star; Doris Belack (from ONE LIFE TO LIVE) as the show's producer; and Dabney Coleman as Lange's boyfriend.  All are matched perfectly to their roles, but ultimately it's Hoffman's show.  And it's a brilliant one!
055357342X|5.0|Only because I'll have to wait until July to move forward with the story.  There are some really nice character developments in this volume.  I'm really excited to see how one in particular plays out.  This is the series I will be recommending to everyone I know who likes to read.  I got a bunch addicted to The Dark Tower, now it's time for A Song of Ice and Fire!
0790744295|5.0|That hand popping out of the grave still scares the crap out of me, and I've seen this movie three times!  That's the joy of CREEPSHOW.  Crafted by the inimitable Stephen King and the imaginative direction of George Romero, CREEPSHOW is a delightfully campy tribute to those great horror comics of the sixties and fifties.  Utilizing bizarre and exaggerated lighting and camera angles, effectively moody music and hammy but good performances from a wide cache of actors, CREEPSHOW still manages to entertain, make us smile and even jump every once in a while.  The best of the stories is THE CRATE, a tense and spooky tale of a creepy monster and a cuckolded husband's revenge.  Brilliantly performed by Hal Holbrook, Fritz Weaver and the bombastic Adrienne Barbeau, this is a tight piece of film-making.  The least effective is the Jordy Verill story, not just because Stephen King overdoes it, but it's just not that compelling a story.  The other stories all have things going for them:  E.G. Marshall in a Scroogelike performance as an evil man who gets bugged by some really ugly cockroaches; Leslie Nielsen and Ted Danson in a cruel game of revenge that backfires; and of course the wonderfully satirical Father's Day where daddy wants his cake.  We get Viveca Lindfors, Ed Harris and Carrie Nye in this one!<br /><br />CREEPSHOW is inspired, and lovingly crafted to please audiences of both horror and comedy.
0553103547|5.0|I woman I \\"met\\" through a fitness forum told me about this series after I had been going on about how much I love the Dark Tower series from Stephen King.  It's actually nothing like the Dark Tower, except that it's REALLY addicting!  You get so involved with the characters and can't believe all that happens to them.  An excellent, EXCELLENT series that will keep you up late at night because you don't want to put it down.  I've had a few nights where I'm reading with one eye closed because I'm so tired, my two eyes can't focus at the same time.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|People who hate this movie often say you must have been in a rural area or without friends in high school to enjoy it.<br /><br />Those who go on and on (you know who you are!) about being intelligent and from a city... you're elitest and need to get down off your high-horse.<br /><br />People who love this movie, and write a review more than a few lines long... well, they're reading far far far too much into it.<br /><br />It's not meant to be deep. It's not meant to have a plot. ND says a lot about life in the late 20th century. But, saying a lot doesn't mean saying anything necessarily significant.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite is just a great story about a nobody living nowhere who really never does anything. To be able to pull that off as a successful, enjoyable film without tragic tears or exploding flying saucers... that's just great.
0553579908|5.0|I'll say it's better than the first only because it takes a little (very little) time to get involved in the first novel and to get to know the characters.  But by the time you start this one, you're emotionally involved with every one of them.  You love some, you hate others.  There's one character that just exasperates you.  I think I read this one in half the time I read the first. <br /> <br />I'm so glad I found this series!!!!!!
B0000640VO|5.0|Suspend all disbelief and allow this charming film lull you into its dreamscape.  This is French cinema at its best and you certainly won't need to uncork `89 La Fitte Rothschild to let this one captivate your spirit.  Amelie is a warm and life affirming film that proves that no matter what station in life we hold we can engage ourselves and make life worth living on the most profound levels and then find true happiness.  Think this sounds like a fairy tale? Well just sit back and watch you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />As the film opens up we see a younger version of Amelie and her friendless life and through the dynamic hues of the filming and dreamy French music we get an idea for what we are in for.  The cinematography is fantastic and if nothing else, watch the movie just to see how beautiful Paris can be.  As the film progresses we see Amelie in \\"the present\\" she is still detached and after finding a box of old things begins performing random acts of kindness from afar.  The big question is she going interact with the world on a personal level and ever find what is missing in her life. <br /> <br />I really liked this film but I will admit that it requires a child-like naivet to watch at some points but the lovely feel of this movie does its best to make this easy on the viewer with its soundtrack and use of CGI.  If you are a fan of Audrey Tautou you should catch A Very Long Engagement. Amelie is terrific you will love it and the director commentary track is worth the price of the DVD itself. <br /> <br />-- Ted Murena    <br />
B000089CJI|4.0|Initially what I heard on this record were simplistic vocals, a string of non sequiturs, layered onto the slowed droning of a DnB loop with staccato snares eminating from each track with the regularity of senior citizens after their morning prunes.     While I would never reconcile with several tracks on this album, ones that I still find monotonous to listen to, more than half of the songs on this record are some of the most unassumingly beautiful tracks I have ever come across. The addition of female vocals on several songs, particularly \\"Nothing Better\\", was genius.     Four stars because while the album still does reach a boring lull in the middle (ie/Clark Gable, Recylced Air), the first four and final three tracks are all remarkable in their own right.
B000002HH2|4.0|As much as I enjoy all her work, front to back this is easily my favorite album of hers. The music is as colorful as the cover. \\"Army Of Me\\" is nearly industrial pop, \\"Hyperballad\\" sounds like just that, and \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\", maybe her most popular song ever, sounds like it came right out of a Broadway musical. Two other highlights for me are \\"Possibly Maybe\\", which usually puts me in a trance, and \\"I Miss You\\", which is just wonderfully wacky, much like it's video. Newcomers should first grab her \\"Greatest Hits\\", but after that, \\"Post\\" is the most.
B00078XKDE|4.0|another great album from vv and hotel aka allison mosshart and jamie hince. mossharts vocals are creepy yet beautiful, much as she is. definitely one of the best rock vocalists around today ... hince's guitar playing is reminiscent of early jon spencer blues explosion, he sputters and blasts out bluesy licks and beefheart-esque noises. \\"murdermile\\" is already my favorite song of the year!!  the album takes a couple of listenings to get under your skin, but then you're hooked. i haven't listened to anything else for a week. get it today.
6302298695|5.0|This is a story of three friends growing up in South Central Los Angeles, the friends are Tre Styles the scholar (Cuba Gooding JR) Ricky Baker the jock (Morris Chestnut) and Darin 'Doughboy' Baker the would-be gangster (Ice Cube) Tre is the only one with a father played by Lawrence Fishburne while ricky and doughboy don't and there mom only likes Ricky. There is some good acting and this is a great hood movie which i highly recommend to hood movie fans
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Listen, their self titled, and iowa were good by nu-metal standards, that's right, I said it, nu-metal, listen to real f'n metal, like hatebreed, chimaira, as i lay dying, I'm not even talking death metal, just good metal, compared to these, this is complete $h!t.  This band should have just quit trying when Stone Sour came out, cuz that's what this album is, the follow up to Stone Sour's s/t.  I wish I could give it a zero.
B00000JGEH|5.0|This 1984 action classic directed by James Cameron is about a cyborg called the Terminator (Schwarznegger) and Kyle Reese sent back from 2029 to 1984 LA. Terminator goes out to kill Sarah Connor (Hamilton) while Kyle Reese has to protect her from him. There is a reason why they go after her but I aint tellin ya. There is some action with good shooting and the Infrared gun is used a lot by the Terminator. This is a great movie so watch it.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is probably one of the best albums I ever heard. Amy Lee's voice is hypnotizing. The music makes you feel something which most music nowadays fail to do.
0385510438|3.0|Although the first part of the book as the third part are really thrilling, you can skip almost all the second part, what happened when Danny was in jail is a waste of time except two or three things that could be written in two pages, the only message of this book is that in Mississippi there were no laws, and the few that existed you could break them if you had enough money to bribe the correct person.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|Judas Priest is back and they sound just as good, if not better, than ever!  There are many elements to this cd.  Some harken back to the late 1970's and early 1980's (as with \\"worth fighting for\\") while others sound much like stuff from the 90's cd \\"painkiller\\".  No matter how you cut it, the cd rocks.  It is very diversified, meticulously written and the musical craftsmanship is incredible!  Highly recommneded if you're a priest fan!
B00005S6K8|1.0|This movie is a terrible remake of a wonderful movie (the original, with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite movies). The acting was wooden and the updated situations and dialogues NO improvement on the original. I had been excited to see this, actually, since I've always liked Harrison Ford and the original movie. What a disappointment. PLEASE skip this one and go right to the original.
B00000272N|5.0|This Is the kind of Metal CD that Gets you pumped and ready to face the day with Great Tracks like Man In The Box and It aint like that. ALl in All my fav Alice In Chains CD
B00063MBU8|4.0|This cd in a way shows the listeners a sense of reality. With songs like Crazy, Shut up and Welcome to my life, this album tells how society and the media can really make a teen feel insecure. When you hear Shut up (for me anyway)it made me want to  scream shut up to anyone who made me think skinny is beautiful or that photoshoped was hip. Some teens like myself might be able to feel word for word but snooty prissy ones may think differ. Good and better than their freshman album. Plus David is like totally hot!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|If you are, your attention span might be below everyone elese that is willing to accept a new sound.  You won't like this album.  I've listened to 'Frances' about 6 times now, and I think Its pretty easy to tell what they're trying to get across.  'Deloused' took me a little longer to figure them out.  This is no doubt album rock.  Those who can't listen to 'Wish you were here' unless its all the way through will enjoy this album.  The lyrics are extremly disturbing once you learn the story behind it.  But its really all about the sound the Mars Volta puts out.  Can't wait to see them live again, and watch them mutate the songs to another dimension.

1400043662|5.0|Murakami's book is a finely crafted amazement!  He truly stretches the boundaries of fiction to just a tad short of the line between fiction and science fiction.  But clearly, it is literature, not science fiction.  Conceptually, the book is put together in a fashion where even the construction of the chapters, mimics the parallel universe and elasticity of time that the author wishes to convey. <br /> <br />He does this with extreme aplomb and high standards.  Throughout the novel there are multiple levels of thought on every subject, philosophical levels, spiritual levels, mental levels and `labyrinthine' paths to follow.  The theme of sexual identity is an extremely basic element to the book.  The way he illustrates it is artful and beautiful. <br /> <br />As implied by the title, Kafka also is a very important element of the book.  And the book borrows from Kafka in its sense of the surreal.  But much more deeply than that, is Kafka, the master of \\"irony;\\" because irony is also central to the theme of the book. <br /> <br />By using a brilliant technique of writing parallel stories that slowly move to convergence, but don't totally make it to the vanishing point, Murakami creates a very active montage effect, by alternating chapters from one story to the other; thus allowing the reader to merge them, as the author exactly so desires.  A story so intricate and so Oedipal is woven into a fine structure, fragile, but with an inner glow that is truly visceral.  The Oedipal story within the irony, sexual identity and intellectual crises of the book, just make it more fascinating to read.  Not to mention the use of Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Johnnie Walker, right off the scotch bottle, as real characters, the use of allegorical animals, and discussions with same all give the book just one more level of complexity in its wonder and emotion. <br /> <br />The book is recommended for all people who appreciate fine modern literature.  The greater your background in literature, philosophy and life experience, the more the reader can personally relate.  However, whatever level the reader is at, this book will expand the mind.  Do not miss the opportunity to read this creation.  <br /> <br />  <br />

I was not impressed. the cussing did nothing to enhance it' it made me wonder if the writer and directr did not have a dictionary to consult. also there was no tie in between pitch black and the chronicles of riddick. in fact pich black made no sence. the chronicles of riddick stands on its own.

B00001U0DP|1.0|This film belittles the evil that is the Holocaust, as well as all victims and survivors. What's next, a film masking the reality of rape? Anyone giving this film a good rating is seriously desensitized to the realities of genocide.     There are plenty of other settings for the director to get his point across of offering hope to his son. Using the Holocaust in this manner is a disgrace. This is also a typical Hollywood film (I know its a foreign film) since it uses plenty of manipulative ploys to draw in an uncritical audience. This is Holocaust revisionism writ to celluloid. Have you ever seen a Holocaust survivor laughing and smiling like the idiot in this film.     Putting the kid in the tank was beyond reprehensible. The irony of that scene juxtaposed against the concentration camps and the understanding that the German blitzkrieg is what initiated WWII must be lost on the director and most clueless, antiseptic viewers.    This is the reality the film deliberately masks (then again maybe Benigni doesn't know it, doesn't want to know it, or doesn't believe it):    \\"There was a sign `to disinfection.' He said `you see,they are bringing children now.' They opened the door, threw the children in and closed the door. There was a terrible cry.     A member of the SS climbed on the roof. The people went on crying for about ten minutes. Then the prisoners opened the doors. Everything was in disorder and contorted. Heat was given off. the bodies were loaded on a rough wagon and taken to a ditch. The next batch were already undressing in the huts. After that I didn't look at my wife for four weeks.\\"     From the testimony of SS private Boeck (Langbein, quoted in Pressac, Jean-Claude. Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers. NY: 1989, 181) .
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I have been to Tokyo many many times for business purpose.  I enjoy its glamourous lifestyle, while suffering from the isolation a lot.  And I already knows Japanese, still I can't feel being accepted in that country.   <br />In Lost in Translation, it can very much attract the predicaments for foreigners.  (say if you understand what the Suntory director said in Japanese).  But what really attracts me its the relationship between Bob (Bill) and Charlotte (Scarlett).  They both are great actor/actress, their encounter is always sexy, but never explicit.  Only with a good script and a good director that such a shy relationship can be portraited in such a powerful way.   <br />As in the interview Scarlett said, this is a character-driven movie, you don't even need a story, all it takes is superb acting plus superb script and superb direction.  The chemistry is movie.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I'm against the Iraq war as Michael Moore obviously is. However, I object to his using people's grief for its shock value. Doesn't he have any shame? I couldn't believe the way he exploited the poor woman who had lost her son. By the way, this doesn't even deserve one star.
044024157X|4.0|The Last Juror is a tough one to rate. I enjoyed it, but what was described on the back cover did not portray what is really inside the book. I expected a series of murders in the Mississippi town of Clanton in which a serial killer wipes almost the entire jury that convicted him. Only about 75% through the book does this plot start to really develop only to reach resolution with a screeching thud. In fact the entire ending is like a curtain being suddenly pulled down. This part of the book gets one star. However, the vast majority of the book is a very enjoyable and informative (for this Yankee) portrayal of life in Mississippi told from the perspective of a sympathetic, but wary outsider. This outsider is a recent college graduate who buys the local weekly newspaper and then explores his new environment in order to get stories for the newspaper. He also seems to a friendly and caring, but slightly arrogant and aloof type who is often the main character in Grisham's books. His vocation becomes a vehicle for meeting and describing the local characters, customs, social mores, good works, corruption, and vices. Along the way, he meets a lot of fascinating people (and eats a lot mouth- watering meals). Grisham's great gift is making the day-to-day experiences of life interesting and heart-warming with human failings not left out. The characters are far from angels, but this is not \\"Mississippi Burning\\" either. Those who liked The Painted House will enjoy this one too. At the end of this day, I strongly recommend this book and am glad it did not turn into the extreme mass mayhem to the legal system that the title implies.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I think this was a great movie the only reason im giving it four stars was because of jar jar but even he has a point in the film as you will see in ep 2. People need to realize that this film is meant as an opener and as part of the whole story not as a stand alone movie. This movie introduces anakin, we get to see that he has a temper, we get to see the young obi wan and the jedi temple and council that gets mentioned in the later episodes. <br />And to the idiot who says that ALL jedi vanish is just crap the old obi wan is the ONLY jedi to do that, the reason this movie is lighter in content is to coinside with obi wan's remard in a new hope when he tells luke \\" there was a time of peace , before the dark times, before the empire\\" if you just watch the movies it all makes sense. <br />You have to remember in this movie the sith are thought to be extinct by the jedi, other than that everything was peaceful . If you have seen all the movies your gonna have a big grim on your face when Palpatine tells young Anakin \\"we will be watching your career with great interest\\" that was by far the greatest line so far in the trilogy. <br />Other than that i luved the jedi sith fights , i finally got to see them in their hayday fighting in out , other than that only you only hear about the way they fought when obi wan told luke,or when luke was seen fighting vader , or obi wan fighting vader but now you get to see a sith warrior and how deadly they are . Overall i loved this movie and thought it was a perfect start to an already legendary trilogy.
1400049628|5.0|Firstly i have to congratulate Max Brooks on creating one of the most exciting and believable books and the only interesting survival guide i have ever read. <br /> <br />Max Brooks writes these hints and tips with such dedication it might leave you wondering whether or not zombies actually exist? Trying to veer away from the religious opinions of the undead (afraid of holy water crosses) and concentrating more on a scientific side (Max Brooks constantly tries to emphasise a sense of realism in his book) known as the virus \\"solanum\\" <br />A large section at the latter pages of the book concentrates on zombie attack stories ranging from thousands of years before christ to jsut a few years ago which are also as believable as the contents of the survival guide and make you wonder if any of the incidents are real. <br /> <br />A very good read and definitaly something i'd recommend.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day came back into modern music in full-swing with their new album American Idiot.  Clear, understandable lyrics make them even more powerful as they deliver a message to their listeners.  The lyrics show emotional distress that most youth of todays world can associate with.  In Boulevard of Broken Dreams nearly everyone can relate to the lonliness that is expressed and that's where Green Day excels. <br /> <br />This album is a must have for anyone with a roller coaster of emotions.
B00009V7P8|1.0|What can I say - I almost crapped myself after hearing this album. It's important to note that Damo's talents are by no means limited to wetting beds in Dublin, or arguing with a old woman - this guy can warble with the best of them.  <br />One thing you should know about me is that I absolutlely love Mr. Rice. He has the fuzziest chest and prettiest eyes. Hearing his silky voice makes all my needs in the world go away. If, musically speaking, we are all cows grazing contentedly in the pasture of pop music, then Damien Rice is the barefoot redneck who tips us over with his unique brand of songwriting. . He overshadows Fred Durst's limp attempt at penetrating the public consciousness with his impressive voice. Some have even compared his voice to that of a llama getting strangled. I personally think it sounds like four orangutans dropkicking a midget. <br /> <br />When this CD came out, it wasn't just a half-hearted re-release of mediocre songs from an equally mediocre and cheesy former grunge singer; it was a watershed moment for all of music. The \\"folk\\" music phase had just started to abate, and people were craving bizarre patriotic songs about freedom from a singer who wets his bed. And sure enough, Damien R. was there. And boy, did he deliver.  <br /> <br />From the hands clapping on butt0cks of \\"Volcano\\" to the thumping didgeridoo of \\"Eskimo,\\" each song is a rhythmic testament to the immortal talent of Damien Rice The musical notes challenge one's hearing to the point of wanting to be deaf, and we are all grateful for that challenge. The lyrics engage and confuse like a gorilla in a bear suit.  <br /> <br />A few words must be said about Damien's remarkable singing style. Damien Rice fills his hairy chest with all the air he can inhale and then screeches it out like two chimps getting pinched by a treadmill. As he howls out his kettle whistle, his lips form the words of the lyrics so that he's actually \\"singing.\\" You have to hear it to believe it. <br /> <br />He hoists up the flag of freedom for folk music like an Irish Bono, gesticulatin' and syncopatin' like an epileptic mongoose. And wait till you hear his voice. That dang thing sounds just like three ostriches getting hit by a cement truck. His trademark \\"hooting\\" during violin and guitar solos secures Rice's spot in pop music history.
B000002B30|4.0|While some of Bruce's best songs are not on this album, e.g. Cover Me, Going Down, this is still a terrific group of songs.  I highly recommend it, but also get Born in the USA as well to complete your collection.
B00004I9VE|2.0|When an album sells somewhere around 30 million copies and it is the biggest selling album in the history of the music business, it does garner my attention.  Therefore, separating out Michael Jackson's personal life from his music - I decided to review his 1982 release \\"Thriller\\".   Looking at this album strictly from a creative musical standpoint, I do think this album is overrated.   For this album, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones assemble a powerful team of musicians.   These musicians - while very talented probably weren't the reason why this collection became the monster-selling album that it became.   Simply put, this album sold because it came along at the right time - and was marketed very well to fit in with the times. <br /> <br />The musicians that contribute to this album are big names.  There probably aren't many names bigger than Paul McCartney.   McCartney is well known for his     entertaining duet with Jackson on \\"The Girl is Mine\\".  However, there are many other big names that contributed collection as well: James Ingram (background vocals on \\"Wanna Be Starting Somethin'\\", songwriter of \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\"),  Toto's David Paich (an arranger on \\"The Girl is Mine\\", Synthesizers on \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"The Lady in My Life\\"),  Mega-producer David Foster (Synthesizer arrangments on \\"The Girl is Mine\\"), Vincent Price (provides the famous sinister 'rap' on \\"Thriller\\"),  Eddie Van Halen (a guitar solo on \\"Beat It\\"), Toto's Steve Porcaro (Songwriter of \\"Human Nature\\", Synthesizer on \\"Beat It\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Lady in My Life\\"), Toto's Steve Lutkather (Guitars and Bass on \\"Beat It\\", Guitars on \\"Human Nature\\"), Toto's Jeff Porcaro (Drums on \\"Beat It\\",  \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Lady in My Life\\"), and LaToya and Janet Jackson (background vocals on \\"P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)\\"  Finally, acclaimed keyboard player and studio musician Greg Phillinganes (who worked on Lionel Richie's \\"Cant' Slow Down\\" and Donald Fagen's \\"The Nightfly\\" - two outstanding albums in this era) contributes to several of the tracks on the collection.  As for the Toto band members, I do feel their contributions are overlooked.   They had only one year ago released their own critically acclaimed album - \\"Toto IV\\" and now they were working on \\"Thriller\\" and Lionel Richie's \\"Can't Slow Down\\" - two of the largest selling albums of this time period. <br /> <br />I don't feel it was Michael Jackson's vocals or any of the outstanding talent that helped this collection become the blockbuster seller that it became.   This album was released in December, 1982.  This was a time the music industry was undergoing change.  This was the beginning of the age of music video.   I give Michael Jackson and his management team credit.   They take what I consider a mostly average set of songs, but they marketed it with some very clever music videos.    Say what you want about Michael Jackson's music - but he did make the most of this medium.   The videos basically became a marketing machine for this album - and it resulted in seven Top 10 hits of the 9 songs on \\"Thriller\\" in the United States. (The title track \\"Thriller\\" is probably the best example of this). <br /> <br />There are several reasons why this album is \\"average\\" at best: <br /> <br />- The Percussions are awful.  Despite having one of the best drummers and musicians in the business in Toto's Jeff Porcaro, this album basically takes a bunch of music and puts a disco dance beat behind them.   There is very little in the way of any solid drumming on this album. <br />- There is little in the way of any cohesion on this album.  Yes it did have a mixture of styles (the Rock-edge on \\"Beat It\\" to the R&B Style of \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"The Lady in My Life\\" to the campy \\"The Girl is Mine\\").  A lot of times this happens when there are \\"too many cooks in the kitchen\\" - while there was a vast array of talent, I do feel that eventually this impacted the final product (even Quincy Jones couldn't fix that). <br />- There is nothing groundbreaking in terms of the music on this album.  Yes, the music videos were groundbreaking - but not the music.  <br />- One thing I discovered is that Michael's songwriting didn't really shine.   I thought it was the songs written by \\"outsiders\\" that were better.   The Steve Porcaro \\"Human Nature\\" penned song is probably the strongest effort on the collection.  Rod Temperton is very underrated on this album.   Many people don't realize that he wrote the \\"Thriller\\" track (while it isn't my favorite, it is probably the only innovative track of the collection). Temperton also wrote the two underrated R&B tunes - \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"The Lady in My Life\\". <br /> <br />As for the positives: <br />- The strong points are the contributions of the Toto band members.  As mentioned, \\"Human Nature\\" is probably the strongest track.   While I've never been a fan of \\"Beat It\\", there is some good instrumentation in there.   I actually feel if \\"Beat It\\" was just done as an instrumental without the disco beat - it would sound good. <br />- Eddie Van Halen does give a terrific solo on \\"Beat It\\". <br />- If you are a Synth-Pop fan, this album (with the exception of \\"Beat It\\") is going to provide plenty of it. <br /> <br />The liner notes include all of the lyrics and do a good job at providing musician and songwriting credits. Overall, when I look at this collection - I just don't think it is the greatest album of all time.   I would even say that for the year it was \\"Album of the Year\\" that The Police's \\"Synchronicity\\" and Lionel Richie's \\"Can't Slow Down\\" were miles ahead of \\"Thriller\\".   The bottom line is that if there were no music videos, this would have been just another 80s Synth-Pop album.   If you are curious on what all the hype is - then you may want to get this collection - otherwise I don't recommend it.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game, the origin of Orson Scott Card's grand saga of Earth's future, is perhaps the best science fiction novel I have read.  It is getting on in years now, and many who have never read it may relegate it as a relic of those dusty, \\"Golden Age\\" science fiction stories where dry expositions on hypothetical technology supersede--and often completely nullify--the impact of the story. <br /> <br />Ender's Game is a novel of much higher caliber.  The characters are true and real, deeply human and agonizingly flawed.  Humanity, faced with extinction in a decades-long war with an alien race, has its back to the wall.  We cheer for our fellow humans, but not blindly.  We see their flaws and we feel their pain, and we shake our heads at the mistakes of the \\"grown-ups\\" when faced with children so brilliant as Ender and his contemporaries. <br /> <br />The impending doom of all humanity pushes the urgency of the story to a near fever-pitch.  This is one book that is easily readable in one sitting, simply for its rapid-fire pace and adrenaline injected plot. <br /> <br />While Ender's Game is chock-full of adventure and war, Card has also created a wealth of emotional, moral, and religious conflicts that cling to the reader long after he has set the book down.  It is here, where Ender grapples with his destiny, where the genius-children--victims of their society--fight among themselves and challenge their world, that Ender's Game truly hits home.  This book, and its lessons, questions, conflicts, and triumphs, is one to re-read over and over.   <br /> <br />I know I do, and I get something different and wonderful every time.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I have had this album about a year now and I have probably played it at least once every day. It's truly a modern classic, in my opinion. However, TMV is definatly an acquired taste. The first time I heard it I wasn't too impressed. In fact, my wife thought she hated them when she heard this the first time too. It is now one of her favorite albums too. Every time I listen to the CD it gets better.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Since I'm not really into either of the respective \\"old\\" bands, I'm just taking this CD on its merits or faults. Here you have essentially Rage Against the Machine minus former singer Zack de la Rocha and lots of political rants and with Soundgarden's Chris Cornell taking over vocal chores.<br /><br />What you get soundwise is crisp, hard rock with some grit that's fairly straightforward although there is occasional experimentation. The lyrics here are often searching and this is a plus and a minus for the CD..sometimes, they're welldone and make for better lyrics than a lot of hard rock but at other times they're overreaching and just end up looking halfbaked.<br /><br />Best moments on the disc come in \\"Exploder's\\" sermon about finding yourself (\\"If you're right, you'll never fear the wrong, If your head is high, you'll never fear at all\\"), ruminations on the awful self-examination that comes after any failed relationship (\\"Shadow on the Sun\\"), as well as the recklessness (\\"Gasoline\\"). They also realize sometimes it's just a relief to be free (as in \\"What You Are\\" when they note \\"I gave you everything but then you wanted more\\"). \\"Hypnotize\\" is as close as the band gets to RATM's self-righteousness (\\"You can make your load a little lighter, All you got to do is share the wealth\\").<br /><br />Low points here come with \\"Bring 'em Back Alive\\" which invokes Icarus, leper colonies and religion in what obviously wants to be a \\"deep\\" song, but it never really says anything. \\"Like a Stone\\" wastes a really fabulous experimental guitar solo from Mars on a songs that's only mediocre. \\"I am the Highway\\" seems like bad Buddhism (\\"I am not your rolling wheels, I am the Highway, I am not your carpet ride, I am the Sky\\"). Much of the rest is neither great nor awful just average.<br /><br />In the final analysis, this probably won't get lots of spins, but the best stuff here is worth having. We'll see what they do next time.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars
B00008PX8P|5.0|The power and content of Led Zeppelin's work will be appreciated by anyone who likes experimental music, whether rock, jazz or classical. In this phenomenal 2 disc set you see them evolve and change, and hear how the physical changes affected their music.<br />Nowhere is this transformation more evident than in Robert Plant, who in concert is one of the three most riveting personalities I have ever seen on a stage, and I have seen a lot. He starts out as a rather scruffy looking albeit brilliant performer on Disc One, the highlight (and one of the highlights of the entire package) is \\"Dazed and Confused\\", with Jimmy Page showing us why he's one of the most creative musicians in rock history, getting amazing sound playing his guitar with a bow. The audio/visual quality is a little fuzzy, but one feels fortunate the concert was filmed, and we have this fine a record of it to enjoy.<br /><br />Disc Two starts with a short take of the \\"Immigrant Song\\" from 1972 in Australia. This is rather jumpy film but it captures the energy of the moment.<br />It then moves on to 4 numbers (not in \\"The Song Remains the Same\\") from the '73 Madison Square Garden concert; here you have the group showing definite signs of decadence, and obviously in a chemically induced haze, and I think it took the shine off their brilliance.<br />Earl's Court in 1975, the group looks much healthier, with a lot more maturity, and some astounding music; the beginning is \\"unplugged\\", with a fantastic \\"Going to California\\", and ending with the classic \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".<br />Knebworth 1979, and we see Plant, looking younger and positively gorgeous, in a blazing, glorious concert. \\"Kashmir\\" is my favorite Zep song, and for the ultimate treat, we get \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", to compare with the version on Disc One from ten years earier.<br />What a journey it was...bravo to Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham for their outstanding musical legacy, and to Page and Dick Carruthers for this DVD package which contains some of the best concert footage ever seen and heard.ome of the best concert footage ever seen and heard.
B0006M4SO6|2.0|I prefix this review by letting you know that I am an ardent Pat Metheny fan.  From my first experience with Offramp I was hooked.  I bought every Pat Metheny Group new release with great anticipation, much like my youth when a new Yes or Genesis album was released.  I went back and bought the Pat Metheny Group previous releases and even dealved into Pat's and Lyle's solo work, which for the most part, never live up to the Group efforts (with the exception of Secret Story).  I can expect experimentation, with sometimes less than stellar results, with the solo work. However, when they return to the Group, you expect nothing but the best.  That is why this release is such a bummer.    <br /> <br />This four part epic just doesn't seem to go anywhere.  It sounds like they mailed it in.  It's a buch of themes and movements without melody or cohesion. Endless noodling on the guitar and the keyboards with some trumpet and harmonica repeating Pat's themes - nothing really new on their own.  Gone is the beautiful interplay between Mays and Metheny on past works. After listening to it ten times I cannot humm a bar.  Interestingly, there are passages patently repeated from past releases which only leave you longing to listen to the past release.  Guitar riffs from Imaginary Day permeate this disc. However, this disc is no Imaginary Day. <br /> <br />If you are a first time Pat Metheny Group listener, do not buy this disc.  Any of their past ten Pat Metheny Group releases is infinitely more satisfying.   <br /> <br />
B00004RF8J|5.0|El DVD que poseo tiene subtitulos y doblaje en español. Verdaderamente es una gran experiencia poder disfrutar de ese ánimo encantadoramente ingenuo que prevaleció en los tempranos 60, con todos sus guiños al cine norteamericano y sus sex symbols y una banda sonora extraordinaria: \\"The little shop of horrors\\" es, sin duda, una joya que todo amante de los musicales debe conocer. Verdaderamente uno puede pasarse días enteros con sus melodías pegadas en los oídos y el espíritu. Además el doblaje en francés incluye la adaptación de las canciones en ese idioma y la banda sonora adquiere una nueva dimensión. Refrescante, jocosa, tierna... Bien vale 5 estrellas.

630522577X|4.0|My Fair Lady is a musical that will live forever without a doubt and the movie version, despite the scandal that it caused in 1964 because Jack Warner cast Audrey Hepburn in the role of Eliza Doolittle instead of Julie Andrews, is still one of the finest musicals ever made. Hollywood was incredibly petty about that issue. Julie Andrews received Best Actress for her role in Mary Poppins that year, and Audrey Hepburn wasn't even mentioned, a nasty slap in the face when she was charming in the role. Today people watching the film would never believe such nonsense; the film is so enchanting nobody could believe such trash could have taken place. The musical took the best of Broadway, brought it to the screen with an amazing success -- shame on the people who tried to bring shame on such a great work!    The Lerner-Loewe score is classic and won the hearts of the world easily when the show premired years ago. Even today, the music serenades listeners with the same charm. Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) meets with Colonel Pickering (Wilfred Hyde-White), by accident the same night he meets the very unkempt and raucous flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), whose coarse manner and poor English doom her to a life of poverty and gloom. When he boasts that he could teach her and pass her off as someone in a higher class, he never realizes that she might actually be listening to him, but listen she does, and to his astonishment, she shows up at his home, intending to pay \\"not more than a shilling, take it or leave it\\" to learn her own language. Pickering, hearing that someone has actually taken Higgings up on his dare, agrees to fund the lessons to watch and see if it will work or fail.    What follows could be considered a comedy of errors or disasters, depending on how you look at it. Eliza finds herself working a lot harder than she ever dreamed, and suddenly she has to do things she never did before, like take a bath every day in hot water. Before long, her father shows up (Stanley Holloway), and in comes the culture clash of the Cockneys and the middle class, a classic British study in social conflict. Higgins can't resist meddling and writes off to a philanthropist, telling of \\"an original moralist, one Alfred P. Doolittle,\\" and thus lights the fuse to a time bomb. Of course, Alfred Doolittle is all too ready to part with his daughter, provided he gets some money for drinking as part of the deal -- so much for his \\"original morals\\"!    Then one evening, it happens. Eliza has her breakthrough. She actually makes it. Her English is intact. Everyone celebrates in the paean to \\"The Rain in Spain.\\" Delirious with joy, they plan an event at Ascot to try out her wings. The only problem is that while she speaks like a lady, she has not yet mastered BEING a lady yet, not to the extent that is required at Ascot. However, with more work, more effort, and more polish, ultimately she does make it at a ball at which she convinces everyone that she is a princess.    The success is complete -- but what now? Eliza has convinced everyone that she is royalty, but where does she go? What does she do? Higgins has won his bet. Everyone is busy congratulating him. Meanwhile, she cannot go back to the life she had. She cannot be what she once was. She is lost, and now she is angry that she has been made into nothing. She decides to leave and goes to the home of Higgins' mother (Gladys Cooper) to seek asylum. It is there that she finally declares her independence in the song \\"Without You.\\" It is only then that Henry Higgins realizes that Eliza has come to mean more to him than just a student, that she has somehow become someone dear in his life, as he expresses in the song \\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.\\"    The musical, unlike the original play upon it was based, actually becomes a strange sort of love story in which both Higgins and Eliza do admit a bond between themselves and remain together. Something about the lyric quality of the musical hasmade it a timeless classic. Now that it has been preserved on DVD, there is no doubt in my mind that it will remain so.    So why do I give it four stars and not five? Because as you will notice when viewing it, there are many parts of the musical that need an audience's reaction to be complete. A perfect example is the scene at the race at Ascot. When Eliza shouts at the race, without the entire audience's reaction, the scene comes across as tepid compared to when there is a full audience; the audience's laughter is almost part of the script. Another such place is when Alfred P. Doolittle enters and laughs; the look on Henry Higgins face when he smells the alcohol on his breath always generates a guffaw from a large audience, but when a person watches it alone, such a moment can slip by almost unnoticed. So much of the script seems to include audience reaction that My Fair Lady seems to be best viewed with a large group of people admiring it together. The greatness of the musical cannot be diminished, no matter what, but when you view these scenes, you'll have to admit that it would be different with a large audience laughing.    When the film was originally made, Audrey Hepburn fully expected to sing the entire part herself, but later most of her role was dubbed by Marni Nixon. This decision came as a surprise to her, and not entirely a pleasant one. In the song \\"Just You Wait,\\" she does sing the opening of the song herself, but the middle part where the more lyrical strain is heard, the dubbing is very obvious. An astute listener can tell when she is singing and when Marni Nixon is singing; she does take credit for at least part of the singing role in the film.
037571457X|5.0|If you're scrolling through reviews wondering whether to buy this book or not then you know by now that this is a comic book, or rather a \\"graphic novel\\" and it is a good introduction to this popular new medium, OK old medium updated into a new format.  This book proves that the comic book is a completely able format to tell a serious, informative and yet entertaining story.  I learned more about Iran and the Iranian people and what it is like to live under Islamic rule from reading this book than from any other source of information I've come across.  Profoundly enjoyable. . . .  \\"buy it\\".
B00001W9G0|1.0|Till now, I thought I can watch Robert Redford anyday. This is the bad movie of all the Redford's movies I watched. Barbara gets on to your nerves. Screenplay is pathetic. Movie is just a mix of couple of scenes put together. It has no emotion whatsoever that others have referred to. Lovestories usually have audience to get related to any character in the movie; but this one fails miserably - you will end up being an outsider watching some hard to pass time movie.
B00079018K|4.0|The last few years has seen a retro revival in alternative music, from Franz Ferdinand and The Killers to The Strokes and the entire NY seen.  It's been a breath of fresh air for a genre that desperately needed it.    Kasabian (named after one of the infamous Manson members) enter the game with a revival of the infamous 80's Manchester sound made famous by Inspiral Carpets & Happy Mondays with a dash of The Stone Roses thrown in for good measure.    However its not just style that Kasabian bring to the table, the songs are catchy, memorable and likely to make you move at some point in time.    Highlights are the 1st single, \\"Club Foot\\" as well as \\"Lost Souls Forever\\", \\"Processed Beats\\" & \\"Reason Is Treason\\".    Overall a very solid debut from top to bottom and early contender for debut record of the year.
B00005JMCT|2.0|I found American Wedding a bitter disappointment - and I say that as someone who loved the series' first two entries. I was amazed, when American Pie 2 was released, the film makers actually managed to capture lightning in a bottle twice. I guess three times was entirely too much to hope for. The major problem with American Wedding versus American Pie and American Pie 2: there's a LOT more Stifler in it. Chris Klein has not returned as Oz. This is bad. It completely scotches the special magic of the series as the unfolding story of four friends (and one jerk) who meet once a year, no matter what, as their lives progress. Because they're just that important to each other. I'm morally certain that many scenes and plot elements originally intended for Oz were given to Stifler instead. Unfortunately, Stifler himself is not that interesting. He's irritating and repellant, actually. Light comic relief as a supporting character, sure, lovely. Carrying the movie on his shoulders, no. <br /> <br />Again, as with American Pie 2, the relationship between Finch and Stifler's mother is relegated to a few brief moments at the end of the movie. Jennifer Coolidge who plays Stifler's mom has put on quite a bit of weight since the first film - it shows in her face and she's typically shot from the clavicle up - which severely limits what they can do with her. It's too bad really. The most complex, intense, potentially interesting and humorous relationship in the series is condemned to a few minutes worth of footage per film. And that little bit of Finch and Stifler's mother is the best thing in American Wedding, earning two stars all on its lonesome. The rest of the movie is a waste. My advice, if you love these characters: buy American Pie and American Pie 2 on DVD, save your money by passing on American Wedding, and hope against hope for another, better sequel.
B0000025F7|5.0|I've yet in my 26 years of existence to see or hear of an act comparable to Micheal Jackson. Perhaps that can be easily seen as favortism and tunnel vision but I think easily millions would agree. With that having been said Off the Wall is a tremendous album. You can literally put it own and dance yourself \\"off the wall\\"(pun gladly intended)! From Get on the floor, working day and night to burn this disco out and of course the Title track Off the wall you can't help but get on the floor and jam. For slow jams look no further than Girlfriend, She's out of my life(great one), It's the falling in love and one of my favorites I Can't help it! You just can't help feeling good about good music and a Terriffic talent and individual. Mr. Jackson hat's off to you and thank GOD for having put you on earth. I believe people off all ages can and will enjoy this album of  \\"GREAT, CLEAN, AND FUN MUSIC FROM AN AMAZING PERSON\\"!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Alright, I admit, I was a bit perturbed when they announced they were making the breathtaking stage show into a movie.  But I went with my friends, begrudgingly I might add, and I enjoyed almost all of it.   <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum- She seems lovely, but her movie performance seemed to be lacking in my opinion.  She does a good job of seeming almost torn between Erik and Raoul but at the same time she comes off as caring very little for either.  I don't think that is what she was trying to convey, but it is how she came across.  Her voice is decent, but as others have mentioned, I expected a stronger voice from \\"Christine\\". <br /> <br />Gerard Butler- Again, some say his voice is subpar as the Phantom but I think he made the Phantom more real to many people.  His emotion came through and so the singing was not always flawless.    In \\"Down Once More\\" his rage and madness come through in the singing, but some think it makes his singing \\"bad\\", nope, just makes his portrayal more gripping.  The make up needed work for his \\"disfiguration\\".  In the scenes with the mask we see this beautiful head of hair and a perfect hairline, yet the mask comes off and suddenly the hair is longer, a different color and the hair line is non-existant because of the disfiguration?  That is a bit of an \\"ooops\\" in the technical department if you ask me. <br /> <br />Patrick Wilson-  The first time around (yes, went twice!) I wasn't sure what to make of him.  His voice was lovely both times, but I was unsure whether it was his acting or Emmy's that seemed to be throwing the plot off center.  The second time I found him delightful and I actually like Raoul a LOT more after the film.  This role should make people forget about \\"The Alamo\\" ;) <br /> <br />The rest of the cast is splendid.  No complaints, they are funny when they need to be and they rivet the attention when need be.  Miranda is a most splendid Madame Giry and Minnie's Carlotta is funny and dramatic, just as it should be.  The setsare stunning and the best part of the whole film may very well be the first 5 minutes when the curtain comes off the chandelier and the Phantom theme swells.  Very powerful.

B00018D3JQ|4.0|Any kind of lounge music with what sounds like a hot chick singing is always good. This album has an added fun factor in that all the songs are 80s covers, so you can throw the album on even if the people you're hanging out with are complete tools and they'll hear something they recognize and get excited. Not every track is incredible, but even the bad ones are pretty chill, so at its very worse, it's good background music. This Is Not A Love Song and Guns of Brixton are excellent. I'm sure 80s purests will be crying about this album but come on, really, get over it. It's just 80s music. Also - it's awesome hearing a girl sing Too Drunk Too Fu. I would write out the full name of the song but I don't know if you can curse on these reviews.
B0007O38F8|3.0|After the success of the album that got him where he is, \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\", he became one of the most famous rappers of 2003. It's 2005 and the rapper has released a new album. This album takes everything that was good with the first album, turns it around, and ruins it. Now, I never thought of 50 Cent as a lyrical genius so I didn't expect much from him on that area, but I did expect some nice beats to chill out to which this album fails to offer.<br /><br />Out of 22(!) tracks, there are only  4-6 songs that are worth listening too and you'll find skipping though most of the songs. At first listen, I didn't enjoy a single track except for Disco Inferno (Produced By C. Styles & Bang Out)and Hate It Or Love It Remix (Feat. G-Unit) (Produced By Cool & Dre). However, after forcing myself to listen to this crap for a few times I did end up liking a few more songs, and hating the ones I disliked even more.<br /><br />I'm Supposed To Die Tonight (Produced By Eminem) was hot the first few times I've heard it but soon after it just got dry and tedious to listen to.<br /><br />Piggy Bank (Produced By Needlz) was by far, one of the worst disses I have ever heard in my life. His rhymes were weak and the beat was weak as well. Fat Joe responded to him in a 14 min interview that killed 50.<br /><br />Gatman And Robbin' (Feat. Eminem) (Produced By Eminem) is a track that I enjoyed and Outta Control (Produced By Dr. Dre & Mike Elizondo) was also an enjoyable track although I can't figure out what he says in the chorus.<br /><br />Disco Inferno (Produced By C. Styles & Bang Out), So Amazing (Feat. Olivia) (Produced By Jonathan \\"J.R.\\" Rotem) were also tracks thats I enjoyed even though So Amazing got So annoying after a little while.<br /><br />Just A Lil Bit (Produced By Scott Storch) was good maybe the first 2 times I heard it, but it's just so damn repetitive that it ultimately fails in the end.<br /><br />The song that ends up saving this crap from eternal damnation( and the reason for 3 stars instead of 2) is Hate It Or Love It Remix (Feat. G-Unit) (Produced By Cool & Dre). This is the only song I can listen to over and over again without getting annoyed of it.<br /><br />So when there are about 4-5 tracks that are listen-able out of 22, you know the album is a failure. But who cares, people are gonna go and buy this album anyways and get this fake-ass gangsta even richer while he continues to make horrible records for his fans.<br />Oh, and WTF is up with the album cover? It looks horrible. G G G G G G G - U NOT!!!!!r Love It Remix (Feat. G-Unit) (Produced By Cool & Dre). This is the only song I can listen to over and over again without getting annoyed of it.

0790731509|5.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers *** <br /> <br />\\"What we have here is failure to communicate\\" <br /> <br />So says the captain about the inmate called \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" in the film of the same name. In the movie, Paul Newman plays a man who lives in a small town. He personifies the very individualistic mindset. <br /> <br />Having nothing to do and no friends, Luke (Newman) decides to do a little drinking while cutting the heads off of parking meters. When confronted by the police, Luke acts like he is drunk (either he is actually acting or he actually is drunk) and finds his way into prison .Once in prison, Luke joins a chain gang. All goes well and, despite a rough start, the inmates begin to like him. He even makes a friend in the form of Dragline, an illiterate man played by George Kennedy. Luke is just about to get out of the prison. Then fate deals him a bad hand. <br /> <br />Luke learns about his mother's death. In his sorrow, Luke breaks out of prison, only to be caught. He escapes again, only to be caught and beaten. Then, he takes a prison truck and escapes along with Dragline, only to be shot by a very accurate prison guard. <br /> <br />This film comments on society's treatment of the individual. In the beginning of the film, Luke's attitude equals the epitome of self sufficiency. He is a loner who considers rules and regulations, as he puts it in the scene with the famous \\"Night in the Box\\" speech, \\"nothin' worth listenin' to.\\" As he lives on in the prison, his attitude of I don't need you frustrates the prison officials who try to get his \\"mind right\\" repeatedly. They take their dismay, and persist in doing this despite it's lack of effectiveness, to the point that they beat Luke. Luke fights them at every turn. They lie and beat him, showing this most sadistically in a scene where they tell Luke to get his dirt out of the captain's ditch. They make him get the dirt out, then complain about the unavoidable effect of having that dirt on the lawnwhen he is done. He has to put the dirt back in. Right after that, he is forced to take the dirt back out again. This cycle continues until Luke reaches the point where he lashes out in frustration, only to be beaten to the point where he falls into the ditch. He comes back out, wrapping his arms around the nearest guard, crying about how his mind is now right. <br /> <br />Then there is the climactic scene with Lukein a church. Dragline comes in and tries to get Luke to give up peaceably. Here, Dragline represents society's desire to get everyone to just mindlessly conform to its ways. Luke refuses, and ironically gets shot. This shooting is interesting if nothing else for the fact that the authorities not only have no reason to believe Luke is armed, but also for the fact that he gets shot for impersonating a prison official. Luke's soul has refused to conform to society's rules and ends up needing to get extinguished. <br /> <br />Thus, \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" becomes a comment on society. Luke dislikes the need of his fellow inmates to latch onto him so tightly. Luke dislikes rules, becoming a non-conformist. Society has constantly tried to extinguish the non-conformists. Examples include the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, and the homosexuals. Like them, Luke is also a non-conformist. Like them, society clashes with Luke. Like them, society tries to kill Luke. Too bad society has not learned to deal with other people's views.

Still, they show their genius in a unique way.
0393035158|5.0|I loved this book and recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about spirituality without all the religious dogma we are subjected to in America. Frankly, I wish more people would pay attention to this type of work. My biggest criticism is that Harris beats up Islam hard, and it's clear the author has a strong pro-Israel bias. It's not that I believe in the validity of one religion or another- I don't. It's just that I don't believe the author of such a great treatise on faith and its misuse should so heavily chastise one religious group, while only mildly criticizing another. Otherwise, the book is solid, well researched, and heavily footnoted for further research.
0786868694|5.0|What is really good about this cookbook is that recipes are simple and delicious. Looks quite obvious to say that about a cookbook, isn't it? The fact is that the ingredients can be purchased in any nearby supermarket (not the kind of gourmet specialties that can be obtained only in exotic far away oriental countries), the preparation is REALLY simple and not apparently simple like in other popular cookbooks we see around. Nigella is an intuitive cook. Her recipes are full of common sense and they are the kind of stuff that can be quickly and easily fixed everyday with excelent results. A great buy.

The first half of the book was simply about the technology of 3001.  The part of the book, that was advertised, was that the Monoliths would be explained.  They were explained very quickly.  There was very little suspence, like in the 2001, and 2010.  It was a real let down.

B0007O38F8|3.0|First off, I like 50.  However, this cd has made his lyrical vulnerablity apparent.  The world is on to his weakness.  The beats are solid front to back and 50 delivers as always on hooks.  However, there are a couple of r&b type pop tracks on here and his flow is often sloppy.  This album is just kind of boring, especially the 2nd half.  I find it funny that he takes on lyrical giants Nas and Jadakiss.  It's common knowledge that he can't match lyrical wits with those two.  He will sell more cd's than Nas and Jada, because he's MTV friendly.  He may win the support of MTV viewers all over the country, but NYC knows the real deal when it comes to emcee skills.  I think this cd as well as the fallout with Game, who has proven to be a solid rapper may have put a chink in the G-Unit armour, but fear not.  50 may be the general with the swagger and muscle, Banks is the smooth lyricist, and Buck brings the south, but Tony Yayo is the truth.  Anyone who has been on to G-Unit prior to <br />Get Rich or Die Tryin', knows what I'm talking about.  Yayo will resurrect this click when his cd drops.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Frances the Mute is without a doubt the best record I have heard all year. Their music is continueing to expand the thresholds of human hearing, (enjoy it while you still have the nerve). It has more of a spanish feel than the rest of their albums, and alot more sonic experimentation, but I don't think the two detract from the overall listening pleasure, if anything they heighten it. I really appreciate the bands use of the recording studio, and their ability to break the barriers of sound and music. Truly a musician's musician.
0395925037|1.0|this book is a diatribe and its really boring.     he is like someone who has the basics of something down  but kind of has missed the whole point. in this case  that something would be logic and reasoning.     however, if you want to find out some reasons behind  why the guy is so screwed in the head, you can read  between the lines here and figure it out.     he was a loser, complete unwanted, germany was in   depression, no jobs, no nothing, and this dumb   @#$@#$ decided he wanted to do something about it....    by killing millions of people and invading other countries.    also its funny to read about how he admired henry  ford for being anti-semitic. gosh i thought america  was anti-hitler from the start, what with all the  indiana jones and john wayne movies i have seen over the years.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is one of those movies you want to just see to enjoy.  Wonderful imagination here on several levels. It is difficult to separate reality from dream/story here, as the film was ment to be.  Burton has done a good job of this.  I suppose you could call this an adventure fairytale of sorts.  Be that as it may, I enjoyed it and would recommend it highly.  Just watch it and have fun!
0780020693|3.0|Amarcord (1973)  <br /> My Italian professor recently told me that Fellini's Amarcord is not just film, it is a national pastime and treasure.  After watching the film, Amarcord represents everything that is good and bad about Italians in the 1930s.  Amarcord realistically, and with a humourous tone depicts Fellini's childhood under Fascist Italy.  Perhaps his most autobiographical work, Fellini examines the life simple and tragic events of a family over a year.  He is able to explore topics including coming-of-age, death, marriage, love, sex and Fascism, all without a single, central character.  Even the film's title, \\"I remember\\" shows the realistic manner that Fellini is able to translate his childhood into a wonderful film. <br /> The film represents reality due to the lack one central character.  Because of this, the action of the film focuses on many different individuals and gives the viewer a broader understanding of the entire town.  It is arguable that the main character is Titta, a boy in his teens who could represent Fellini as an adolescent.  It is hard to agree that Titta is the central character because he is not involved in the majority of events throughout the film.  Titta is clearly a major part of Amarcord but he merely represents youth, just as his father represents his own generation.   <br /> A major theme in the film is a significant generation gap.  There is a generation gap between Titta and his father and there is an arguably large gap between Titta's father and his father's.  The generation gap that is evident in the entire film is not a concrete barrier, for it can be broken.  Titta physically breaks this gap when he shares an intimate moment with the Tobacconist in her shop.  The generation gap also symbolically shows the differing ideals in Fascist Italy in the 1930s. <br /> Although every scene in the film contains humor, Fascist Italy in the 1930s was hardly a laughing matter.  Fellini downplays Fascism and politics in Amarcord because they are open to interpretation.  While some may be critical of its brutal nature, some Italians continue to represent its ideals.  Still, even with humorous undercurrents, we see the Fascist regime as overpowering and forceful.  The Fascists rough up Titta's Socialist father and force him to drink gasoline.  In a later sequence, we see the Fascists murder a dissident, playing the violin in the town's bell tower. Fellini's  most disturbing imagery of Fascism depicts young children, both boys and girls in support of the brutal regime and firing guns.  This imagery brings to mind old videos from the Nazi regime showing millions of people, including children praising Hitler.  Fascism in Amarcord not only depicts an accurate historical representation, but further shows one aspect of Italian life in the 1930s. <br /> The most successful aspect of Amarcord is Fellini's ability to show real, everyday events that allows the viewer to understand the culture and personality of the Italians.  It is even more amazing that Fellini is able to apply humor to all of these situations and still allow them to appear realistic.  In many different scenes Fellini uses examples from his childhood, such as his strict grade-school teacher to help the viewer better understand Italian culture.  He depicts and exaggerates turmoil within the family.  It is in these exaggerations, like when Titta's father pulls the entire tablecloth on top of him after a fight with his wife, where Fellini's true sense of humor are displayed.  Not only do we laugh at this humorous action, we learn more about the familial roles of Titta's family.  It is in the comedic exaggerations of sexual desires, teenage love and strict teachers that continue to make Amarcord so immensely popular with the Italian people.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock was in near-perfect form when he made \\"Rear Window,\\" a stylish, minimalistic blend of mystery and dark comedy. This thriller explores \\"what you shouldn't see\\" skilfully, with a few funny bits thrown in. And having a cast that includes Grace Kelly and James Stewart doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />Photographer L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries (Stewart) got run over during a shoot, and is crankily waiting for his cast to come off. While he does so, he spies on his neighbors -- some sleep on balconies, some argue, some weep alone, and some (\\"Miss Torso\\") dance in spandex. To make things worse, Jeff is having intimacy problems with his wealthy girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), because he fears settling down.<br /><br />But then Jeff's window-watching clues him in to something -- sickly Mrs. Thorwald vanishes, and her husband Lars (Raymond Burr) is seen acting suspiciously with a saw, rope and metal case. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. He manages to convince Lisa and his down-to-earth nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), but detectives won't believe him. So without moving from the room, Jeff uses the rear window to watch Thorwald -- and find out what really happened.<br /><br />Okay, peeping on your neighbors is not just creepy, it's illegal. In the case of \\"Rear Window,\\" that fact doesn't really matter. Watching the fellow tenants is as much fun as the mystery itself, whether it's the newlyweds, the pair that sleep on the balcony, the weepy Ms. Lonelyheart, or the buxom dancer Miss Torso. It makes the story even more chilling when you realize that one -- or maybe more than one -- of these seemingly harmless people is a murderer.<br /><br />Hitchcock -- who appears as a musician -- kept his deft touch in a movie that could have sunk like a stone. All the action takes place in one room, but he keeps it from feeling confining. Instead, the minimalistic set takes away all distractions, and makes the interplay between the characters even brighter. And much of the humor is provided by Ritter -- she's not a comic character, but her homespun wisdom is delivered with tart humor.<br /><br />Jeff is likable as only James Stewart could make him -- this guy is bored, crabby and in denial about his feelings for Lisa, but he's likable despite that. Kelly does an equally solid job as the \\"girl who is too good for him,\\" who also proves that in a pinch she can rise beyond her uptown-girl roots. Back when many women were relegated to side roles, Lisa gets to be an equal detective to Stewart.<br /><br />\\"Rear Window\\" gives a view into one of Hitchcock's best films, a taut thriller about how, if you watch other people, you might see something dangerous.

B0000YEEHG|4.0|Persona (1966) <br /> <br /> Bergman's Persona begins with many seemingly random images, including an eye being removed from its socket, a child crying, an erect penis and an animal being slaughtered.  The first three minutes of the film is a jumbled, cluttered and fast-paced sequence that appears to have no continuity whatsoever.  The genius of Bergman, as a masterful \\"auteur,\\" is revealed as many of these same images conclude the film, only now they clearly have a significant meaning to the action of the film.  Bergman's ability to symbolize abstract concepts such as loneliness, abortion, rage and sadness in this confusing sequence clearly depicts film as art.  Persona, technically, visually and symbolically demonstrates the ability for film to be seen as a form of art. <br /> Throughout the film, Bergman uses many symbols to show the progression of the relationship between Elizabeth and Sister Alma.  Twice in the film, Bergman visually shows how Alma and Elizabeth have switched roles.  The \\"overlap\\" between the two women is first seen when Elizabeth enters Alma's room while she is asleep.  As Elizabeth is about to exit the bedroom, Alma jolts out of her bed and embraces Elizabeth.  As the two sit side-by-side, they embrace, as Elizabeth physically crosses her head over Alma's far shoulder.  The same sequence occurs toward the latter part of the film.  From these identical scenes, it is easy for one to conclude that Alma has become Elizabeth.  Alma and Elizabeth have switched roles; Alma has become the one needing help and Elizabeth appears to be the silent, yet attentive listener.  As we see later, the roles have changed when Elizabeth writes to the doctor that she has been \\"studying\\" Alma.  The most significant role-reversal between the two occurs when Alma has sex with Elizabeth's blind husband and pretends to be Elizabeth.  Yet, it is the image of the two beautiful  women intertwined that seem to describe the complexities of their relationship much more appropriately than Alma making love to Elizabeth's husband.   <br /> The film visually shows us the emotions and mind-sets of the main characters.  In the opening sequence, Elizabeth is seen lying in a room that resembles a morgue.  There is no movement or sound (diagetic nor non-diagetic) and everything in the room appears dead.  It is quite startling when Elizabeth suddenly opens her eyes, as if she is suddenly awoken from a horrible dream.  She appears terrified and at the same time lifeless.  She does not make a sound, nor does she utter more than a couple sentences in the entirety of the film.  This one scene shows that Elizabeth is terrified as if she is keeping a secret.  The secret that is later revealed, not by Elizabeth but by Alma shows that Elizabeth has feared motherhood and it has caused her to become a mute.   <br /> The film is largely about identity roles and how we perceive each other.  Bergman creates these unbelievable scenes that force us to question reality and how we perceive reality.  He also uses misrepresentations to depict false perceptions.  Initially, Alma believes that Elizabeth is good-natured and sincerely interested in her difficulties.  As the film plays out, we see that Alma's perceptions are wrong and that Elizabeth is in fact using her.  It seems as if Bergman is saying that it is truly impossible to really know someone else.  Our own projections, however false they may be, are largely the only way we think we know a person.  Bergman's most significant message of Persona tragically shows our inability to truly know anyone else from ourselves.
B000002UC5|4.0|McCartney is easily not Paul McCartney's best album, but it doesn't need to be looked as such.  At this juncture in any of the Beatles' careers, they were at a crossroads, Paul was at his, as Lennon was at his, as Harrison was at his.  Is this the weaker of the three intro solo albums?  Of course.  Harrison's solo effort is much more advanced, much more exploratory, and much, much more indepth.  Lennon's first effort is a cry of agony, and the emotion that drives that album is so undeniable, it is painful just to discuss it.  McCartney has never reached the level of songwriting that Lennon attained, even as a Beatle, he was way behind John Lennon.  While his music has always been good, his lyrics are dribble.  His lyrics are so weak that it is ridiculous to discuss Paul McCartney in any serious conversation about rock lyricists.  His music, however, stands piles above many.  If anything he is a supreme tunesmith, a wonder of melody.  And that is what this album is about, Paul's ability to create tunes, to make listenable music, music that is not offensive, not a cry for help, not exploratory, but music for the sake of it.  With that he has succeeded, and we can only say that this album is very good because of that.  \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is worth the price of admission alone.  Also, if you were to compare this album with some of the horrible stuff he put out in the late 70s, this music on McCartney  would rise above such sappy crap as \\"My Love\\" and the rest of that dribble he forced down us.  This is not great music, but it is 4 stars.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I got this cd, brought it home, and immediately placed it in my stereo. I hate commercial rap, but I had to see what the buzz was about. You know...everybody and their mother is going to buy this cd!  So I popped it in and started it up, but somehow my brain managed to slip out the back door or something during the first song, and I was left there, sitting on my bed, drooling, my head cocked upwards, while 50's album played in the background. My brain didn't return until right after the whole album had finished, ironically. So, I guess this was a good listen, although my brain was absent for the duration. I can't seem to remember any specific songs or phrases, though. I have no idea why...
B000002H97|5.0|This was the album that hooked me onto Metallica.  I'd heard their older stuff on the radio and was too young to know what album to choose, so I bought the Black Album (for something like 149 Francs in Europe!)...and it brought me to where I am today: I love everything about Metallica.<br /><br />While technically I would give this album a 4.5 rating, I will round up since this is a masterful recording indeed.  Metallica has grown up, polished their shoes and dusted their suits.  No longer do they sing about drinking, drugs, or insane asylums.  Those are topics of the old days.  I wish I could say Jamez's lyrics are a little more mature, but they're really not.  To be honest, this album is the beginning of the decline in lyrical standards.  (When I read along with St. Anger, I cringe at the forced rhymes...I *hate* forced rhymes!)<br /><br />Gone are the speed days.  The complex riffs, the counterpoint, and meaningful lyrics.  So what does this album have?  A new direction.  Nothing gets old.  I'd rather hear Metallica for everything they're worth, not for everything they've done.  James and Crue have found success with their ultra-amazing past albums.  When people say Metallica began selling out at this point, they are completely entirely wrong.  Metallica was technically selling out by recording what everyone wanted, in order to make money.  Now they had their money and could afford to (along with taking large amounts of time off) diverge.<br /><br />Take it for what its worth.  Anyway, the Black album has songs that are just brilliant when performed live.  The best is Of Wolf and Man...\\"are there any wolves out there?  Ah-roooooo!!!\\"

He attacks Fat Joe, Jada, Shyne, and even Nas (the undisputed king of new york).  50 is a fake thug who only comes up in the news when he's getting attacked, you never here about him victimizing anyone, you just hear about him being the victim.  You only hear about him getting shot, stabbed, and putting restraining orders out on murder inc. Just like TI says, \\"All that gangsta s*** you talking, yeah it sound good but make it understood you gon have to show me.\\"  He has limited rhymes and he's a fool to think he's at the top of the rap game, he's not even in my top 10.  If there is a such thing as committing career suicide, he just did it.
B000007MVM|3.0|Syd Barret's first solo album was the dark flip side of [[ASIN:B000002UA0 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]: while both drew from Syd's infamous acid habit and a fantastical sensibility, 'Piper' felt like a series of whimsical storybook songs, fleshed out with pyschedelic instrumentation, whereas 'Madcap' is stark, unwashed, wild-eyed and dazed.     Part of the albums rawness is due to the circumstances around its recording: Barrett's inability (or unwillingness) to perform a song the same way twice rendered the normal process of doing takes until he got it right impossible, so producers Waters and Gilmour were forced build the overdubs around the best completed take; interestingly, Mike Rateledge, Robert Wyatt and Hugh Hopper from the Soft Machine proved to be adept at keeping up with Barrett's unstable, meandering style as well as contributing some oddity of their own, like the assorted noisemaking through \\"No Good Trying\\" or the oddly deadpan, straightforward shuffle of \\"Here We Go\\".    Many of the rest of the songs are simply Syd singing with a single guitar and the occasional overdub; these tend to have a more folky, meandering feel, though the sublime adaptation of the James Joyce poem \\"Golden Hair\\" manages to hold together remarkably well. Most of his performances are beyond amateurish, and the singing veers in and out of key (\\"If It's in You\\" is the worst offender, with Syd doggedly singing far outside of his range to somewhat painful results), but it's this rawness that gives the album its dark attraction. Those looking for coherence and sanity are advised to look elsewhere, as the music here seems possessed, with its songs staggering about in a daze, tempos speeding up and slowing down at the same time, and lyrics utterly ignoring any sense of meter and beat.     This album deserves recognition in some form, if only for being and uncommonly raw and uncompromising, but while it may a cool name to drop in some circles, it is definitely not accessible; the utterly surreal, disjointed lyrics and the shambolic, ramshackle performances are sure to drive many listeners away. Those who have a taste for its wobbling vulnerability, though, will find a somewhat harrowing first-hand account of an uncontrollable descent into madness and schizophrenia; as Syd howls \\"Wouldn't you miss me at all?\\" on \\"Dark Globe\\", one can't help but wonder if Waters was answering that question when he wrote \\"How I wish, how I wish you were here.\\"
B00067189O|1.0|Only after plunking down $15, I discovered this package contains disappointingly duplicitous supplemental material.<br /><br />I bought this issue for two reasons: photos and outtakes. The disc's tray and promo sticker copy clearly state the DVD side contains a \\"photo gallery\\" and a selection of \\"audio outtakes from the master sessions.\\" Is that so? The DVD menu's single video link points only to a brief documentary tellingly titled, \\"Made In Heaven.\\" The DVD audio selections point only to the music tracks. A quick examination of the disc in Windows Explorer yielded no folders containing any stills or audio files. Okay. So where are the promised audio outtakes and the photographs?  Perhaps Columbia's idea of a \\"photo gallery\\" and a selection of \\"interviews\\" are those rare session snapshots and a few seconds culled from a 1979 Bill Evans radio interview which sparsely pepper the 25-minute \\"documentary.\\" The film registers as a sadly over-produced pastiche of gassy, embarrassingly gushy interviews with famous talking heads who add little to what an attentive listener can gather from simply listening to the music. Each personality is on screen for only a few moments delivering some clever phrase one sound-bite at a time (Rapper Q-Tip: \\"They're the Justice League of jazz.\\") Columbia further aggravates this annoyingly post-MTV quick-cut pace by intercutting straight head shots with archly trick camera angles, I presume to keep the viewer's attention from drifting off or perhaps to distract the viewer from the sheer lack of valuable content. I don't care if Bill Cosby listened to \\"So What\\" every morning while he was in college. I don't' care that Shirley Horn has three copies of the album. I don't care to watch Herbie Hancock mug for the camera while sloppily fingering a passage from \\"All Blues.\\" I don't care if Ed Bradley never scored to \\"Flamenco Sketches.\\" What on earth does any of this pap have to do with the making of the record? Thinly interwoven throughout this wad of garbage are the \\"photo gallery\\" and the \\"audio outtakes\\": a few seconds of Miles mumbling in the studio under such heavy hiss you can't make out what he says, a snatch of Bill Evans saying he just \\"made up\\" the double trill on \\"All Blues,\\" and Jimmy Cobb offering the only honest take on the whole package when he says he can't understand why the record gathered so much attention, and when he demonstrates the \\"floating\\" brush effect he developed on the spot. Add to this the handful of animated (yes, animated) session stills, and you have little more than a half-hour infomercial bent on selling you the disc. Please. I already paid for the programming. And like most of the Western world I was sold on this music long ago. This embarrassingly bad reissue only detracts from the recording's value and Columbia's credibility. Deliver what you promise or don't promise it. And don't package some of the greatest music ever improvised on record with one of the worst short films ever pressed into plastic.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, a small text box containing very tiny print proclaims \\"The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the audio side of the disc.\\" Enjoy.wad of garbage are the \\"photo gallery\\" and the \\"audio outtakes\\": a few seconds of Miles mumbling in the studio under such heavy hiss you can't make out what he says, a snatch of Bill Evans saying he just \\"made up\\" the double trill on \\"All Blues,\\" and Jimmy Cobb offering the only honest take on the whole package when he says he can't understand why the record gathered so much attention, and when he demonstrates the \\"floating\\" brush effect he developed on the spot.

B0002Z0EYA|4.0|First of all this movie is a lot of fun to watch - even at close to 3 hours long it goes by fast.  While I know this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, the one star givers need to lighten up!  IT'S A MOVIE not a documentary - if you want that go to A&E or BBC. While I do not know much about the history of the Trojan war, as an educated professional, this movie did not insult my intelligence.  The only reason I would not give this movie 5 stars is the simple fact that I seriously feel Brad Pitt was miscast as Achilles.  I do not dislike him (I just think he is better suited to the \\"Oceans ELeven\\" roles), but the fact that whenever he would come on screen, I would think \\"oh, it's brad Pitt\\" really destroyed his credibility as Achilles.  I however did enjoy the masterful portrayals by Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole as Hector and King Priam.  Hopefully the seldom cast Eric Bana will get better gigs after this film.
0553801546|2.0|I was excited to hear that Robin Hobb was bringing Fitz and the whole troop back for another series and the first two books did not fail to entertain.<br /><br />However the final book really left me disappointed.  The whole thing with the prince and the dragon to win the heart of this tribal girl really fell flat.  They had zero chemistry when together and the Out Islanders really were not very interesting as a people.<br /><br />Plus I don't think Fitz got the ending he deserves.  I won't say one way or the other what that means, but suffice to say, he is not given his just rewards here.<br /><br />It would have been better to toss the whole idea for the trilogy than let it end this way.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Only Britney has the power to get me shaking my jaded behind when it comes to the pop scene. I enjoyed a lot of the tracks on here and I hope someday she works with people who are actually cool, and not people like the Ying Yang Twins who are probably as lame and unhip as anything in the universe could ever be. I think Britney is fun. What is the point of ripping on her when there are so many singers out there who suck even worse?
B0000019PA|5.0|Let me preface by saying that I myself am a musician and a music teacher, and I have a lot of hipster friends who listen to all sorts of pretentious crap that they try to push on me. I was skeptical upon hearing a pal of mine describe their sound, as he threw around words like \\"folky,\\" \\"phantasmagorical,\\" and \\"surreal.\\" I've recorded and worked with instrumentalists and vocalists many times, and I am not fooled or impressed by bad vocals and crappy production for the sake of \\"originality.\\"<br /><br />That said, I have to say this has to be one of my favorite albums of all time. The music itself flows beautifully; you can easily start on the first song and fly through the whole album. The sound is perfectly suited to the style of lyrics and singing. Really, you would not want this produced any other way. Cleaner bass playing, crisper guitars and drums, a more competent vocalist - all of that kills the concept behind this music. Those who criticize it from the production angle are missing the point. Sure, the Decembrists have a cleaner sound, but it is silly to compare them to Jeff Magnum's efforts here.<br /><br />The quality of a song, a singer, a guitar player, or any music at all, does not necessarily correlate to the production or even the individual technical competence of each musician on their particular instrument. What matters is artistic vision. What matters is whether or not the music itself is powerful and affecting. Johnny Cash was not the greatest of singers. Ringo was an average drummer, at best. Neutral Milk Hotel's music is beautiful on this album, because every aspect of how it has been made - the strained singing, the fuzzy production, the relentless strumming, the wacky drums - all of it gels perfectly, each part is perfectly suited to work with every other part. The total is greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />This is fine example of the essence of good music. A creative spirit and self-assured mind is all one needs to make something legendery. Listen to the radio to see what kind of trash can be made with high production budgets, the best trained musicians, and studio vocal magic.
0312997221|3.0|To all negative things have been already said here about the 'Avenger,' I can only add that command of Slavic languages and deep knowledge of Eastern European and Soviet affairs had never been Mr. Forsyth's strong points (face it, he failes on that even in his best novels). He says that only Russians or Ukrainians (why not Byelorussians, too?) could have made it in Soviet military, but, for example, two late Chechen leaders, Dudayev and Maskhadov, were generals in Soviet army, and they were not an exception. Really, his accusation of Russians as the most racist people is rather misplaced. F. Forsyth (and his editors) can't even see the obvious: on the same page, he says that there was about 180,000 Kosovars in Kosovo (i.e., less than TWO hundred thousand), and then HUNDREDS of thousands Kosovars fled the province. Same for the reconstituted nuclear program in Iraq. ... Though Mr. Forsyth appears from time to time as an 'expert' on TV, don't read his books as thoroughly researched documentaries.
B000006TRV|5.0|People are obvioulsy entitled to judge...its on us to not get misleaded...n any review below 4 stars for this album will serve the same...misleading ppl from great music.Well i think ppl who own this know that this is one priceless n timesless album....listen to this and come to know what kind of things matter in this world.I know...ull come to know.
B0002XDOBC|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Cream. They are my favorite band in the world. And that's coming from a 21-year old college boy.  <br />OK, to the album. This is one of the many Deluxe Editions being released by Polydor and Universal Chronicles. What do you get? The entire album in stereo and mono, out-takes, demos, and BBC recordings. For a fan who wants that first Cream album, get this edition. Or you can go for the single album, which is much more affordable. If you have the \\"Those Were The Days\\" box set and the \\"BBC Sessions\\", you really don't need this edition. The only thing \\"new\\" you will get is the mono album and \\"Blue Condition\\" in D(as opposed to in C on the record) with Eric on vocal. But if you are an obbessed fan like me(and some other reviewers...ha ha!!), you'll go out and buy it(like I did!!). The mono sides are interesting, as I am not familiar with too many mono albums.  <br />Like I said before, if you are a new or casual fan(or an obbessed one!), go out and buy this album. It will be worth every penny you spend on it. Then be prepared to get the Reunion CD when it eventually comes out(hopefully), since they are doing 4 shows at the Royal Albert Hall in May.
B0007O38F8|1.0|50 cent is tha biggest punk in tha game. Where was 50 before he found Eminem? getting shot 9 times thats what. He wants to hate on Ja for doin slow songs when 50 has jsut as many \\"pop\\" or slow songs too. He wants to be Ja but he cant, but 21 Questions is exactly like Ja Rule Put IT On Me, he copied the video. 50 wants to dis Jada, Nas, Fat Joe, and Shyne? Please, he aint nothin but a snitch, a wanksta. You must be a lil wanksta if you get shot 9 times in tha hood. 50 had albums before Get RIch Or Die Trying. But did they sell? NO! He's lame as hell, 50 needs to just quit and get off Eminem cuz hes the only reason why he is \\"popular\\".
B00005JNBQ|4.0|It is funny how seriously people take some movies, and how deep they want to read into them.  This movie is just what it is supposed to be: extremely funny.  That BS about only enjoying the movie if you were a nerd in high school, or if you were cool, has nothing do with anything.  It is about laughing at good comedy, which is something that is few and far between now days.  This movie is a must see for anyone with a good sense of humor. <br />Tidbit: Pay attention to the year on Napoleon's student ID in the opening credits.
B00062RCBW|5.0|When it first appeared in 1986, I was skeptical that this series could ever equal the first in quality or excitment or just a sense of wonder at the universe.  So I ignored it for over two years, and then by chance, one night I watched an episode and was utterly thunderstruck at its humor, characters, and sophistication of theme.  Far superior to the original series, I then became utterly addicted to TNG and watched it and its re-runs for the next ten years.<br /><br />In retrospect, I see the original Star Trek as rather formulaic.  Kirk is a kind of cowboy, getting into a myriad of situations and, quite often, blasting his way out in the last 15 minutes.  If he didn't, which often occured, he made points with superior aliens who saw potential in mankind, etc.  This is very much a reflection of the era in which the U.S. viewed itself as inherently good and right, with the Vietnam War in the backgound.<br /><br />In TNG, the use of force is viewed as a failure, though sometimes necessary.  Diplomacy, stalemate, and ambiguous outcomes are the rule.  I think this is a far more sophisicated view of mankind, which again reflects how much the U.S. has evolved since the simpler era of the 1960s.  Furthermore, it must be admitted, the actors of TNG are much better than those of the first series, making it a great pleasure to watch and savor.  What's more, the characters evolved from season to season, which is extremely rare for TV.<br /><br />Now the entire series is available!  My wife and I watched this as newlyweds, and now, with this fine set, we are introducing it to our children.  They watch it and come back to us with questions and (in our biased view) brilliant observations about the details of character and plot.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B00007JVBI|5.0|Some of these songs would work well to gently put a child to sleep, others might make you want to smoke cigarettes, slam down a few beers, and maybe kick a trashcan into the street.  This connection is way off but listening to Cat Power reminds me of Elliot Smith; not nearly as depressing but just as intense and vulnerable.  Ya, \\"quietly intense\\" I think describes this album rather well.  Wonderful stuff.
B0006Z2LCE|4.0|Stop the insanity!  No, this is not an infomercial rather this reviewer is getting tired of single and double disc CD compilations of Donna Summer!  This collection is TOO similiar to her 1993 Anthology (which I like better!)  I do feel it is high time to give the fans a FULL PORTRAIT of Donna Summer with her music now spanning over 30 years!

It's fine if you buy this, but only if you don't have any of her music on CD.
B0002858YS|4.0|I highly recommend this CD to someone with an open mind about new rock music. The Killers introduce a new version of their own original rock: classic rock mixed with 80's electro synthesisers. Along with the well known \\"Somebody Told Me, other tracks that stand out prominently are \\"Mr. Brightside\\" (quite possibly the best song on the CD) and \\"Midnight Show.\\" Slightly more mellow songs are \\"Andy you're a Star\\" and \\"Indie Rock n' Roll\\" which still strike beautiful chords and rhythmn. Smile like you mean it is also a slow rock ballad with those electro synthesisers, and Jenny was a Friend of Mine is quite different althogether. It's quite an angry angsty sort of song and has a strong beat you can tap your toes to. What great is that the lead singer doesn't have a whiny/little kid punk voice. He has a grown-up sophisticated voice, that doesn't make you want to punch him. Please buy this CD!
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Yes, this is yet another pairing of a heavy band and a \\"mainstream\\" producer gone bad (ok, not totally mainstream but Rick Rubin did produce Johnny Cash and LL Cool J). If you like Beatles harmony vocals, Acoustic guitars and mixes with less low end than a Toyota commercial then this is for you. There is a record lying underneath all the junk here so if you're a Slipknot fan like me then buy it and put it in your audio editing program, crank up the lows and cut out all the tunes that reak of over production and burn a new cd. I sure hope they come back with  Volume 4 and someone like Terry Date producing.
B0002IU988|5.0|ok, i got this cd for my 15th birthday and i wasn't too excited, because i had only heard open their eyes. I went home and popped it in my cd player and i was like \\"OH MY GOD!\\" these guys are extremely awesome! Every song on the cd is awesome. and myles kennedy is the man it's like this guy came out of nowhere, i have his second skin album now and is awesome too, but the guitar playing is alot better on one day remains. These guys are even better live, i saw them in montgomery, AL, and they had submersed open up, then silvertide played, and then mark tremonti walked out and starting rocking one day remains and i went berserk! If you get the chance see these guys live they are so awesome!These guys and velvet revolver are the best bands around right now, real rock has guitar solos and deep lyrics! THESE GUYS ROCK!
B0000DIXN7|5.0|This girl has a gritty, jazzy, billy holiday style voice with the addition of some ballsy amazonian lyrics and feminst gutsiness. Her songs are engaging and soulful, speaking of bluesy and gritty themes. She sounds like a world weary, gin aided, jazz diva with great songs and tales of two many broken hearts. Their is a a \\"Manhatten\\", cynicism in her voice and all this from a pretty 19 year old, South London girl! Cracking!
0790729369|5.0|<br /> <br />This movie is so Awsome!   It also leaves the door open for a great discussion!!!!!  What would you do in that situation? And I mean ...\\"what would you REALLY do?\\"
B000089RVR|1.0|Or is the girl outstandingly over rated. From my estimation her voice is dull, monotonous, tedious and samish. Unfortunately I feel the same about her penmanship, her songs are morose and are so similair in nature that they bleed into each other. I find the sentiment behind them worryingly self indulgent too and suspect that this may be at the root of her mass appeal. I for one one am waiting only for her bubble to burst so she will go away!
1401301010|4.0|This thick book is the memoirs of a relatively young (early 40s) and not particularly mature man--- who just happens to be Anthony Kiedis, the singer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  There's lots and lots of sex and drugs here, along with some rock and roll.  He structures it as the traditional tale of the slow rise to stardom, followed by a few years of excess with redemption and sobriety at the end of the road.  The joke is, however, that the rise to fame was pretty quick (though, thanks to drug use and bad recording contracts, fortune arrived long after fame did)--- and he has lost and found sobriety many times during a career which is now well into its third decade. <br /> <br />His writing (in collaboration with a ghostwriter named Larry Sloman) is engaging, his sense of humor is sharp.  He names names and tells scandalous stories on everyone from Sonny & Cher to Nirvana to the Spice Girls--- especially on himself and his bandmates.  I am not sure if all these stories actually happened, but even the lies have the ring of truth.  This is not a masterpiece, but it's worth looking at.  To quote one of the band's album titles, this book is full of blood, sugar, sex and magic.
B00004KD1L|5.0|...I love everything this band puts out, but this truly is their seminal work. A heady and intoxicicating mix of ambient chill and thumping, infectious club tracks. Grove armada have a knack for making tracks people recognise and yet don't recall the name of, this adds a certian cache which gives the tracks mass appeal and longevity. Treat your ears, they'll love you for it!
B00001OH7P|5.0|I stand by this review that I posted 10 years ago, I just need to write more about the genius that was David Bowie.  Yes it's a concept album, but that's not what makes it legendary 33 years later.  For the countless words that have been written about the Ziggy persona, the persona did not make the legend.  Only great songs could do that and Ziggy Stardust delivers.  Concept schmoncept as far I'm concerned.  Every track on this CD (possibly excepting &#34;It Ain't Easy&#34;) stands on its own as a great song.  &#34;Five Years&#34; may be unparalleled in the rock catalog for sheer drama.  Sometimes the lyrics seem a little silly or obtuse when you actually try to figure out the meaning.  But with a song as brilliant as &#34;Starman&#34;, Bowie could be singing about Cheez Whiz for all I care, it's that good.  You don't need to be a Bowie fan, a glam fan, or a 70's fan to love this disc.  I'm a fan of great melodies in any genre played with passion.  The 11 songs here are irresistible. If you have any empathy at all for popular music you must own this disc.  Oh, and thank you Virgin for not cluttering this release with tons of forgettable B sides and alternate takes which only dilute the quality.  These 11 original tracks are all I need.
B000001OAA|4.0|I always liked \\"Im only happy when it rains\\" and \\"stupid girl\\" back when they came out and still listen to them everytime they are on the radio so I figured why not give the whole album a try based on the great reviews here. I was not let down! Every track rocks! Shirley has a beautiful voice! If you like great rock, give Garbage a try.<br /><br />Mike, Atlantic City area, NJ
B000148KK2|3.0|I really expected to like this CD more.  So I kept listening to this expecting it would grow on me.  But I've learned that, even though some CDs take several listens to catch on, it's not going to stick more than it has after 10 listens.    This is not about what Ms. Krall has recorded in the past.  Nor is it about whether this is Pop or Jazz, I don't really care as long as it's good.  I'm very open minded about music and judge any recording on its own merit.  Half the songs on this CD are covers and half are original compositions (her first) co-written with husband Elvis Costello.  I don't find the covers were that well chosen.  \\"Love Me Like A Man\\" is thoroughly unconvincing, like a suburban housewife auditioning to be a stripper.  And a lot of the original material sounds like it would have been better suited to husband Elvis.  \\"Abandoned Masquerade\\" is just boring.    This is certainly not a bad CD and \\"Departure Bay\\" is outstanding, one of her best on any album.  On paper, the combination of Krall/Costello seemed unbeatable but, as we know from sports, dream combinations on paper aren't always borne out in reality.     I can certainly understand why Ms. Krall would want to do this, especially after marrying one of the best pop songwriters of the last 30 years.  It's just disappointing it didn't produce better results.  There's no shame in doing covers, after all how many songs did Sinatra write?  There's a rare skill to selecting excellent material and interpreting that material in a fresh and exciting way.  This is a skill that Ms. Krall has clearly demonstrated (on previous releases) she possesses.     It will be interesting to see which direction Diana takes from here.  Whatever it is, I hope it produces results as engaging as many of her previous releases.
6305127646|1.0|IF YOU A FAN OF THE SAINT (EITHER THE BOOKS OR THE ROGER MOORE TV SERIES) DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!<br />The only saving grace for this movie is that it starts by exploring The Saint's childhood as the source of his behaviour as an adult - something that was never done in the books or the TV series. Unfortunately, having piqued your interest, from then on it's downhill all the way. That is compounded by a corny script, Kilmer's stodgy acting, and really bad disguises. Only a Kilmer fan could love this movie. It's not even good enough for &quot;Bad Movie Night&quot;.<br />The really sad thing is that the movie rights to &quot;The Saint&quot; are probably still tied-up with someone who is not capable of producing a good Saint movie. Although I'm not a fan of the current Batman movies, it would be good to follow their example of bringing out the dark side of the character. The Saint is basically a thief. Even when he does get the stolen goods back from the bad guys he does extract his payment, either by taking a commission or by robbing the bad guys (and where do bad guys get their money from?). He is also ruthless - as he has to be because he inhabits a dangerous world. These are sides of the character that for obvious reasons, ATV couldn't bring to the TV version. It would also be interesting to put him in his early context of 1929-1945 but without the corny tosh that Hollywood would make of it.
0393324818|4.0|How exactly does one of the poorest teams in Major League Baseball, the Oakland A's, manage to win so many games year in and year out? This is the question that Moneyball seeks to answer. The answer, it turns out, is that Billy Beane, the general manager of the ball club, is one smart man. <br /> <br />Beane, while maybe not as book-smart as other GMs in the game, has the uncanny ability to assemble a team of misfits and win ball games. The secret of his success? Statistics. But not traditional statistics like batting average and RBIs. He thinks outside the box when he looks at statistics. <br /> <br />His right-hand man, Paul DePodesta, encouraged Billy to look at other statistics that are not as highly regarded by other teams: on-base percentage and slugging percentage. Beane listened when nobody else would, and has been unafraid to fly right in the face of conventional baseball wisdom. Based on the team's record over the past few years, it seems to be working for him. <br /> <br />This book is, in a word, engaging. The author Michael Lewis does an excellent job of painting a portrait of Billy Beane as, at times - especially when things don't go his way - unable to control his emotional outbursts, but also as a man who is wiser than he wants to let on. If other teams latch on to Beane's personnel strategies, he's no longer of any value as GM. Luckily for him, the other GMs are too stubborn to buy into his philosophy. <br /> <br />Moneyball is a must-read for any sports fan, baseball or otherwise, but I also recommend it to anybody interested in thinking of new ways to accomplish old goals more efficiently, through patience and proper analysis of a wealth of information.
0880389052|5.0|Of many fine Forgotten Realms novels R.A. Salvatore has written, this one is probably the most creative and easily the most important.  In Homeland, Salvatore fleshes out an entire race for D&D by giving us the first deep look into drow or dark elf civilization.  By doing so, he also gives us new insights into the enigma that is Drizzt Do'Urden, the dark elf ranger and Salvatore's signature character.<br /><br />Homeland begins the Dark Elf Trilogy and follows Salvatore's Icewind Dale Trilogy, serving as a \\"prequel\\" to that series.  We learn of Drizzt's life from birth to early adulthood in the malevolent society that is Menzoberranzan, the City of the Spider Queen.  Equally important for the FR world, Salvatore introduces the important institutions, noble houses and religious practices of the drow, which sets the backdrop for many other novels in the FR setting.<br /><br />Salvatore does not seek to develop deeply any particular characters here besides Drizzt.  Instead, he develops the entire drow culture, showing the amoral, individualistic and sadistic behavior of the drow, with an emphasis on the oppression of males in the matriarchal society brought about by the worship of Lloth.  Drizzt's struggle as he matures to harmonize his own ethos to that of the drow culture is the central plotline of the book, and when the naive, sincere and ethical Drizzt finally resolves the struggle in three fateful encounters with his father, his enemies and his family, Drizzt as we know him is born.<br /><br />Some suggest Homeland should be the first book someone new to the Drizzt saga should read.  However, I recommend reading the books in the order written, as Drizzt's past is even more engrossing when the reader knows of his present.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Popular fantasy doesn't get any better than this.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is that rarest of movies - a hybrid of the past and the future, of action and romance, with comedy and wit tossed in for good measure. Its greatest asset, however, is that it is a visual feast, sweet eye candy for all manner of moviegoer. While the story may be rather predictable, it is forgiveable, because you have never seen a film that looks quite like this one. <br /> <br />In 1939 Manhattan, scientists have been disappearing, with no likely reason in sight. An army of stories-tall robots flys in and attacks, rampaging through the city streets and collecting whatever it is they are looking for. Newspaper reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is hot on the story, putting herself in danger to get the scoop and take some front-page-worthy photographs, while Joe \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan (Jude Law) is called in to do combat with the robots and save the city. <br /> <br />We learn that the scientists are being gathered together by Dr. Totenkopf, who is responsible for the robot invasions. But why? Sky Captain enlists the help of his sidekick Dex (Giovanni Ribisi) to find out what is going on. Polly, in the great tradition of classic strong females in the cinema, insists on tagging along with Sky Captain as he does battle with the machines in search of the evil Totenkopf. She wants the story, and she's gonna get it, even though there is bad blood between Joe and herself, due to a previous relationship. <br /> <br />I dare say there has never been an action movie of this ilk. The story of the making of the film is quite fantastic: the director Kerry Conran managed to sell this film to the studio after putting together a 6-minute short film. Producer Jon Avnet then managed to convince Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow to sign on based on the merits of the short. The actors were filmed entirely in front of the green screen, and the backgrounds were added later digitally. This film is a feat of technical mastery, but what makes it work isthat it in spite of all of the special effects, it never loses sight of the characters, and it makes reference to the great history of Hollywood cinema, everything from Metropolis to Strangers on a Train to THX 1138. <br /> <br />And did I mention the visual style is stunning, with its combination of 1930s pulp and futuristic sci-fi? While watching this, I felt as if it was not just a movie, but an experience, which was what it must have felt like back in the golden age. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a great success, and a fine achievement for everyone involved.
B0007NFL18|2.0|I gave it 2 stars because it has some pretty good production, but if I were only judging lyrics, this album is a zero.This album is dissapointing at best, no matter how you look at it. If you want a CD with great beats, this CD is definitely above average in its beat production, but doesn't even come close to standing up to 50's first CD or Game's beats, and production is supposed to get better over time.  Lyrically, after listening to other younger G Unit members Game and Lloyd Banks recently, it's almost painful to listen to how bad 50's flow is.      On both his singles he says the same phrase \\"take it to the next level.\\"  The CD is full of meaningless phrases like this that only affirm that 50 hasn't taken it \\"to the next level\\" lyrically, instead he's fallen off. The line that pisses me off more than any of the other pointless phrases he says is on the song everyone's heard: Candy Shop.  He asks \\"Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?\\"  The line offends me not because it degrades women, but just because of how stupid of a rhyme it is and proves fifty may know less about what irony really is than Alanis Morisette.  I feel dumber every time I hear it because it doesn't make sense, there's nothing ironic about having 'watching a girl in a thong' be erotic.  That's pretty much the norm, fifty.      Game made sure his first CD was a classic, he took you on a jouney through the history of the last 15 years of rap music.  This CD on the other hand is all recycled garbage useless lyrics that nobody will learn anything from or even rewind a single part to hear it again, because you won't care.  His flow is all monosyllabic rhymes, he would be nowhere if he didn't have street cred of being a real gangster.  One may think you could at least look forward to the standard Aftermath classic tracks: a couple Nate Dogg tracks, a good Eminem feature, a couple amazing Dre beats.  However, all those are missing, the Dre beats are minimal and just OK, no Nate, andEminem's feature is his worst in a while.  The whole song is stuck on this stupid comic book charcacter theme (Gatman and Robin) that Em started with that lame song Superman, which was on his 3rd album when his albums started to suck coincidentally.  Em tries way too hard to flow to the melody of the song, and the beat and melody are so repetitive, it sounds really lame and like he's warming up by singing up and down scales as he rhymes, and I am a big Em fan.  Anyways, 50 has a couple good lines on the whole album, but he seems to already have Snoop Dogg syndrome (completely out of rhymes so you resort to lame single syllable rhymes like boom, zoom and tomb) by his second album. People keep mentioning Piggy Bank as a highlight, but that song is terrible, don't waste your money downloading it.  Songs that you should check out to see which ones you like the most for downloading include the following in order of how much I like (#1 = favorite and so on...):    1. Just a Lil' Bit  2. I'm supposed to Die Tonight   3. God Gave Me Style  4. So Amazing  5. Position of Power  6. Get in my car  7. A Baltimore Love Thing  8. The Ski mask way  9. Ryder music  10. Hate it or Love it Remix ft. Game AND Lloyd Banks  11. Build you up ft. Jamie Foxx  12. In my hood  13. My toy soldier ft. Tony Yayo  14. Disco Inferno  15. Candy Shop
B000002KJL|5.0|I bought this album when it came out in 1977 when still in high school.  My brothers and friends and I were heavily into Rush, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin.  But after a long night of listening to pure testosterone guitar, we'd always put this on and just sit and listen, slouched on the couch or on the floor with blood-shot eyes staring into the distance.  Because this album has a simple, calm magic to bring out visual and musical images;  it's the guitar, like no other, the lyrics that whole scripts could be based on, the composition, so perfect it seems obvious.  The guitar rings long after the songs are over. <br /> <br />For me, \\"Water of Love\\" is the heart of this album.  To this day, when I feel far from where I need to be, I can put on \\"Dire Straits\\", clear my mind with the wonderful \\"Down to the Waterline\\", and then let \\"Water of Love\\".... work, show me, fix me, flow over me, in. <br /> <br />This used to be the perfect \\"date\\" album.  I'll still put this on sometimes for my wife when the kids are in bed and we have some time for ourselves. <br /> <br />Will 18-25 year olds enjoy this album?  Maybe.  This is as close to perfect craftsmanship as pop music gets.  Maybe even art.   <br /> <br />Will it live forever?  Probably not.  But I can see some college student in 2505 glummly flitting through a vast archive of \\"Rock Music\\", coming across \\"Water of Love\\", realizing that the late 1900's wasn't just zero dimenssional dates and names, but had flesh and blood, heart, and a soul. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I finally took the time to watch Napoleon and I have to say that I enjoyed this movie more and more after the fact then when watching it.  My brother got it and I watched it one night while he was at work and sat there stratching my head the entire time.  When he came home we started talking about the film and he and I realized the same thing, more of this movie sticks with you then you think and then when you go back to watch it a second time you catch even more.  I say go rent or buy it and watch and see if you get the same reaction but after I watched the movie and started talking about I liked it more then when I watched it.<br /><br />Couple things about watching it, it is very monotone.  No characters in the movie seem to speak up or at a higher level then the next one.  I didn't really see this until my second time watching the film.  I am still unsure when this movie takes place.  Everything has a look and feel of being around the late 80's but there are more modern references and music so I have assumed that it is like that because they live in such a small town.  And the one thing that REALLY surprised me was that there was no curse words.  I have no problem with language but I actually found myself looking for one in this movie while watching a second time around because I was so surprised there were none.<br /><br />Great film will watch again and is now part of the library.
B0002KQNL8|1.0|this movie is a total insult to the first movie \\"the return of the living dead\\" i know it's supposed to be a parody movie and all but only a kid would find this movie funny <br /> <br />i first saw movie when it came on tv(network tv)when i was 11 and i didn't even find it funny at all i found it lame that the \\"hero\\" was a 8 y-r-o kid i mean come on now he couldn't even hold a gun right <br /> <br />i might have saw this when i was 11 but i never really saw the first one \\"the return of the living dead\\" until sometime later i'll be the first to admit that one was MUCH MORE SCARIER than the unfunny parody movie <br /> <br />the zombies in this movie look more like stoners then zombies <br /> <br />and there was like no explaination as to how the first two people from the first movie were able to survie the nurclear bomb in this movie <br /> <br />they just all of suddenly stopped being zombies and returned to being normal living people? <br /> <br /> <br />why did the \\"hero\\" have to be a kid for? were they trying to please the soccer moms out there by having a kid in a \\"horror\\" movie saving the day? <br /> <br />this movie is so awful that i'm still embrassed that i ever watched it <br /> <br />skip it you'll thank me later!

There was all kinds of information about Jewish people and how the were treated that I had no idea about. I think anyone who wants to know how Jewish people were treated back during the Hollacost should read this book, it gives a great of amount of detail.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I first became acquainted with Josh Groban on a Christmas Holiday Special.  I was impressed by his voice and wondered if he was just another \\"fly by night\\" singer.  It pleases me to see how beautifully he has evolved and what a pleasant young man he seems to be.  Most of all I am thankful for any one from this new generation who can blend sweet vocals on to the beautiful tapestry of music and lyrics to produce a melodious and expressive masterpiece.  I enjoyed Josh's first album but this one really showcases his talent.  Mi Mancherai, When You Say You Love Me, Per Te and all the rest are a banquet for the ears.  I highly recommend this collection.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I was beggining to beleive that rock was dead. I would listen to groups like Wilco, Linkin Park after reading great reviews and I would be bored out of my mind. This record rocks from start to finish. It is intelligently written and played with great intensity. Unlike most new records today that I can barely get through one play, I find myself listening to this over and over.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Worst. Movie. Ever. I which I never wasted my time watching this piece of crap movie, THIS WAS TERRIBLE. Funny? WHO CARES! There IS NO PLOT AT ALL. Don't waste your time or money, this is the worst movie ever made to date.

B0007P3582|5.0|This album does not meet up to Get Rich or Die Tryin standards but its still a decent album, i guess he was tryin to do somethin diffrent. But anyways Nas, Jadakiss, & Fats Joe fans will NOT like this album because they are used to lame, suckass, beats that will neva grow, they are good lyricists (except for Fat Joe) but will neva amount to 50's level, its just politics, Nas & Jadakiss is known to dis people that make more money than them (Jay-Z, Kanye West) so i guess they have decided to target 50. But i think their careers will become like Ja Rule's........ruined. And also Nas is really a selfish dude, if he spent more time helping the Bravehearts instead of chanting it maybe their album would've went past 10 copies bought, 50's album is good i love it & i listen to mostly Southern rap, so this has to be a good album for me to love it. But any body who says this album is weak really has a problem with good music. The album is gonna sell regardless like i said IT'S JUST POLITICS.
B0007NFL18|2.0|This CD is way under what 50 is capable of. His mixtape 2050: Before the Massacre is way better. This is a good cd to have in your collection but dont expect it to bring it like Get Rich or Die Tryin. 50 could do way better. <br />Hot Songs <br />1. Disco Inferno <br />2. Piggy Bank <br />3. My Toy Soldier <br />4. Candy Shop <br />5. Get In My Car <br />6. Hate it or Love it remix (not even a 50 song). <br />My suggestion for a flamin rap cd: The Game's The Documentary
B00005JNBQ|4.0|\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is one of those movies which should only be seen once. The main character, Napoleon Dynamite, becomes annoying 2/3's of the way into the film. Basing the movie around him becomes the film's major problem. John Heder does what he can with the character, but doesn't succeed much.<br /><br />However, the film does feature fascinating supporting characters. The best character is Pedro, who is one of the best low-key comedic characters I've ever seen. The actor does a commendable job. The rest of the cast is also fascinating, and makes the film bearable.<br /><br />The DVD also features extras that, like the film itself, only require one viewing. If you're interested in low-key comedies, then this film is for you. For the rest, \\"Spaceballs\\" and \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" are funnier!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B-
B00005Q4CS|1.0|This picture appears to have been the result of multiple film school experiments.  It depends entirely on contrived and unnecessary camera tricks as well as cliched destructive patterns that are supposed to serve as warnings against drugs.  Also, there is the arbitrary placing of symbols throughout, only enhancing the thick stench of pseudo-Freudianism that is brought by the ridiculously obvious oedipal anxiety that the Leto and Burstyn characters suffer (imagining his girlfriend in a red dress while his mother obsesses over a red dress). <br />    This film was apparently an attempt to manipulate trite patterns that attemtp to conceal an overall lack of creativity.  That makes sense, since this film is patently uncreative.  I finished this film knowing nothing more about the characters than when I started, and caring even less.  Development and depth are ommitted in this film and all that is left is a pretentious and superficial attempt at something \\"postmodern\\"
B0006GAO3G|4.0|Barry Sonnefeld's \\"Get Shorty\\" was in many people's opinions the best adaption of an Elmore Leonard novel to that point. John Travolta, who had just made his big comeback performance in Quentin Tarantino's \\"Pulp Fiction\\" scored another massive hit with his role of Chili Palmer, a Miami lone shark who gets sent to Hollywood to muscle a B-movie producer but ends up getting swept in by the business. Along for the ride is an all-star cast including Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny DeVito, Delroy Lindo, Dennis Farina, and James Gandolfini. \\"Get Shorty\\" is a fun, hip good time. The DVD special edition includes a deleted sequence involving Ben Stiller, an audio commentary, and a number of extra featurettes.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Closer tells the story of self-centered characters and their selfish motivations (and this is why it is interesting). Some reviews and viewers insist that this kind of story produces no sympathetic or likeable characters. I disagree.  <br /> <br />The selfish, flawed nature of each character makes each one more believable and human (which the slightly stilted dialogue-adapted from an original stage play-could easily have masked had less skillful actors played in these roles) and ultimately moves the story along. Perhaps the lack of sympathy viewers and reviewers profess is because some of the more hypocritical and brutal aspects of the characters hit too close to home. As the poet Gavin Ewart wrote in \\"Short Time\\": \\"when two illusions meet, let there not be a third/of the gentle hypocrite reader prone to think/that he is wiser than these self-deceivers. / Such dreams are common. Readers have them too.\\"  <br /> <br />Indeed at the core of this film a divide exists between who the individuals really are and the perception of who they should be (ideally). After seeing the film, which didn't immediately overwhelm me, I found myself thinking about the motivations driving each character. (This is part of the strength of the film: it is thought-provoking and leaves one wondering after the fact.) Without spoiling any endings, one must wonder why Julia Roberts' character Anna makes the choice she does. One must also wonder, especially by the end, if any of these characters knew one another at all or if they were so self-involved that they used the others in their lives to fill voids absentmindedly, disregarding all the consequences. Did anyone in this story truly know the individuals s/he chose to have in her/his life?  <br /> <br />The timeline in the film jumps around, as the film's four characters jump into and out of each other's lives. The film begins with Damien Rice's song \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" (auspicious beginnings, if I may say so) and almost immediately two of the four characters (Jude Law's \\"Dan\\" and Natalie Portman's \\"Alice\\") meet. As the story skips ahead, Dan and Alice live together, and Dan meets and ardently pursues Julia Roberts's \\"Anna\\". (He is, at least initially, rebuffed.) Enter (through rather comedic circumstances) \\"Larry\\" (the most human and real character of the film played effectively by Clive Owen). Anna and Larry get married, and at this point, relationships start to unravel, revealing both the selfishness and the deep vulnerabilities in each character. Trust, if indeed there ever was trust between any of these characters, breaks down. It is never clear, though, that the people involved have any real clue what they want. Mostly it is the same old story: they want what they can't have but don't want it when they have it.  <br /> <br />Not being a fan of Julia Roberts or Jude Law, I was prepared to dislike their roles. However, Law was perfect as wishy-washy, hypocritical Dan, and Roberts was razor sharp in both her sarcasm and in her more emotional scenes (particularly with the talented Clive Owen, who is always eminently watchable). Natalie Portman's performance, if not her character, is probably the most arresting here because her Alice is at once strong and self-sufficient but at the same time has the appearance of someone needy and vulnerable. She announces to Dan at the beginning of the film that her relationships end because she falls out of love, and she is always the one to leave. In the end, when Dan treats Alice as a kind of consolation prize and comes back to her more out of desperation than real respect or feeling, the viewer wonders not only what Dan really knew about Alice (he perceived and assumed rather than really knowing/finding out) but also what lies below the surface with anyone in life. Just as in real life, individuals often seek out others to stroke their egos and to feel \\"needed\\", and this story weaves multiple variations of this kind of emotional manipulation into one story.  <br/>
B00076ZZ9I|5.0|There seems to be a general misunderstanding as to what Dual Disc is. The CD side is exactly the same as the CD release (no difference whatsoever). <br /> <br />The DVD side has 2 parts to it, the first being a DVD-Video section which gives you the album in Dolby Digital and all the video extras etc.  The second part is the album in High Resolution format and is called DVD-Audio. This portion will only play on DVD-Audio players (not your average DVD-Video player). <br /> <br />If you have a decent DVD-Audio capable system then this is definitely worth it for the advanced resolution sound. Otherwise it's only worth it if you are interested in the extras. <br /> <br />Oh and by the way this is a great album - buy it!
B00005JKN9|4.0|I feel compelled to defend Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York, as so many people, mostly audiences and NOT the critics, felt this film was either a) too long or b) too violent.  Some didn't like the movie as a whole, and that makes sense,, but those who argue, as one friend of mine did, that it \\"had too much fat\\", (as in, needed to be cut) just didn't seem to be paying attention in my opinion.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the first thing I should say to those who said it was too violent is \\"Read the book.\\"  The film was inspired by, but not totally based on, Herbert Asbury's non-fiction book of the same name (published I believe in the 1930s?).  One reviewer wrote that this movie was \\"Pornographically violent,\\" indicating that the film's violence is \\"avowedly theatrical rather than realistic and...The violence itself is realistic yet inauthentic, by which I mean it is heavily stylized and ritualized...Situations are set up in artificial and implausible ways in order to provide opportunities for bloodier and nastier acts.\\"  Contrary to popular belief, violence of a grand scale is not something that started in the Roman colesiums and stopped until violent movies of the 20th century.  After reading the book by Asbury, I can honestly say that most, if not all, of what the film portrays in its violent scenes are probably much less graphic than the type of violence that really occured in the streets of New York at that time.  Five Points was a type of Warzone, in which the police mostly steered clear, fire-departments did battle over who got to put out what blaze (a territorial conflict), and a man named Bill \\"the Butcher\\" did exist and wielded an amazing amount of power over the area. Although I doubt blacks would really have been allowed to \\"hang-out\\" with Irish gangs at the time, as one reviewer did point out as a historically inaccurate flaw.  Violence-wise though, Scorcese probably did what few directors (Mel Gibson, for example) would not do:  toned it down even when hedidn't have to.  Violence, like it or not, is a part of human nature and history (we're mammals, you know).  You don't have to like it, but you have to accept it.   <br /> <br />Another reviewer argued that the riots at the end of the film showed, \\"some kind of glorious uprising of oppressed peoples against their racist oppressors.\\"  Funny, I saw a bunch of angry poor people attacking the wealthy (because so few of them had to fight the war), and killing blacks, for whom many Americans did (and still do) think the war was being fought for (it wasn't!).  Although the film didn't get into vast details of the riots (black hospitals and orphanages were burnt down; thousands of the cities blacks, including women and children, were murdered), which may have been a bad thing to leave out, to aruge that the riot was about oppressed peoples against racist oppresors is false.  They were racist against blacks and killed many thousands of them, and they also targeted the upper-classes who could buy their way out of dying.  I think the film did a good job of showing just why the riots occured, and did enough to recognize the fact that even those in the Northern states were not immune to racism. <br /> <br />As far as the \\"dull, ineffective framing device\\" (he means the plot) that one reviewer talked about, what was wrong with it?  Vengence is as old as story as any, just like love or crime, and can make for great theatre!  In this one, the son of an immigrant finds the man who killed his father (Priest, played by Liam Neeson) and seeks his revenge.  What makes this plot NOT boring and truly effective, is that the boy, DiCaprio's Amsterdam, get's so close to his father's killer, Bill \\"The Butcher\\" Cutting (Day Lewis), that he sees him as a noble warrior, and possibly a father-figure himself!  What...like you saw that coming?  If you say you did, you're lying to save-face.  The story-line takes a while to build up because these aren't simple characters in a simple situation. The film is cut into two parts, both of which are perfect halfs to a complete whole.  Saying this movie is too long is like saying the Seven Samurai by Kurosawa could have been reduced an hour or so if they just left out some of the battle scenes, or found the other Samurai quicker.  No, that just wouldn't do.  In this film, to cut out or in any way reduce the bond between Bill and Amsterdam, despite Bill's hatred towards the Irish and Amsterdam's hatred towards his father's killer, would be cutting off the movie's limbs.  Then, indeed, the plot would just be predictable Hollywood slop.  The driving point of the film is not its history; no, that is a powerful and necessary back story.  The main conflict is based around the irony that the killer of this boy's father is actually a noble warrior who saw the \\"Priest\\" he killed as a worthy advesary, at one point admitting that the Priest gave him his best beating.  It makes it hard to see this brutal-bigot as an antagonist for both the audience, and Amsterdam.  The conflict is reached out to us, and the film's hour-long finale (give-or-take a few minutes) is completely necessary to show Amsterdam building up resistance to succesfully take down the most powerful gang-leader in the Five-Points.  Trim the fat?  No, you're just impatient.  I hope that the Amazon.com reviewer is right in the assumption that this film will achieve greatness with the passage of time.   <br /> <br />(Oh yea, Leo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese probably aren't sleeping together.  Face it folks, DiCaprio, despite his popularity in the 90s with teenage girls, is actually a good actor.  Now get over it...)
B000002H97|2.0|I have gone through and read a lot of user reveiws on this album. To be perfectly honest I am disgusted at the number of nu bandwagon   <br />crappy metallica fans there are out there. Metallica's first four albums proved them to be arguably the best metal band of all time. They were loud, agressive, and intricate. Metallica used to be a politically driven band with a voice for people who had no voice. The black album is the first album where metallica allowed the record label to compromise their music. They had other studio musicians and writers to help with the creation of this album. It was obviously an attempt to sell more records to the general public. Well guys it worked, you became the biggest band in the world but lost the respect of most people who truley love metal. The only reason i gave this album 2 stars is because there are a couple of decent metal songs here. Holier Than Thou and Of Wolf and Man are pretty good, and dont get me wrong they are still better than most new crap that is out, but in the begining of thier carrer they set a precident that is no longer matched. I feel bad saying negative things about a band that was once so great, but I just cant wrap my mind around them. I am a pretty accomplished guitarist and I know people don't typically regress musically. I know they still have the musical talent, in fact the could probably be better than thier first four albums, but for whatever reason the choose not to. That is the saddest part of the whole thing. Dont buy this album, dont pay into metallica's own musical castration of themselves. And with this album it only gets worse.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Angel of Retribution, or AoR for short, took almost 14 years to reach metal fans. Well, metal fans will quickly discover that Priest's latest effort was worth the wait. Others have already discussed the album in detail. I do not want to regurgitate facts.  However, I'll say this; Angel of Retribution will be remembered as one of Judas Priest's top 5 albums. To say that AoR is a solid piece of work is an understatement. Older Priest fans will love it. Younger metal fans, whether Priest's or not, will discover what the rest of the metal following in the world already knows: The classic line up of Judas Priest makes up one of the greatest bands the genera has ever produced. <br /> <br />Enjoy. <br />
B000777J2S|5.0|This is one of those strange albums that doesn't remind you of anything you've heard before, surprises you, gets under your skin. The songs are honest and urgent yet they sound plaintive and melodic. He achieves a sound that moves in and out of a sort of spiritual, or lounge-gospel, bluesy nina simone, melodic piano, and his voice can soar and settle into a deep wound. It's not for everyone, but this album is going to win a lot of hearts and minds.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|After being sentenced to exile in a past full of retards by the   Mc'Donalds coorperation, I decided to locate my grampa and his kindred. What I found was a room full of fools watching this movie. This terrible movie! Where is the point in the actors, charactors, or worst of all for this lame excuse for a comedy: Where is the humor? In the behind the scenes someone boasts that \\"We made a good clean cut comedy with nothing vulgar.\\" That is just an admittance that is wasint funny! I laughed only once. It was when napoleon failed his bike ramp, but that was because I thought he just died and the credits would roll! I was too lazy to get up and turn this (...) off. They say you need to watch it twice, which is when the secret subliminal rewiring takes root in you mind! You can watch Bob Saget a 1000 times and  it only gets worse. Did he write this movie too?   The point is this: \\"why would you punish yourself again?\\" This train of thought is why people in the future call you \\"the generation we do not speak of\\" ,bad apples taking dumps on film. This idea was sooooooooo simple and lacked any filler. A whole nation is bowing before their \\"vision\\" I could have written this film. So could you or anyone. Does that make it art? NO! But it makes it a gimmick! Now If you want magnificence, listen to some michael Bolton. People in the future cant get enough of the old recordings of our dictator! My grampa said everyone at his job begged him to see it. I told him that they were possibly trying to dupe him into blowing his weekly welfare budget, and they would all secretly laugh at him if he said it was a \\"Funny\\" movie. (which is what they might be doing to you if you admit you watched it) In the year 2015 The Great Wall(CO.Wal-mart inc all rights reserved) is built, those who like this movie are on one side, those who don't are on the other. Dont be foolish enough to forfeight your grandchildren's burger rations. They'll dig up old blockbuster rental records and find you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000024A70|5.0|One of the most successful British rock groups of the seventies and eighties, Queen started as a quasi-glam rock group but evolved a style all their own, combining elements of pop, rock, heavy metal and a few operatic touches.<br /><br />Bohemian rhapsody, their biggest hit, was twice a UK number one hit - first on its original release and second on its release to raise money for AIDS charities, following the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury due to AIDS. The song also made the American top ten twice - first on its original release and second following its use in Wayne's world, a few months after Freddie's death, when it made number two. This classic song, seven-minute mini rock opera, overshadows everything else that Queen recorded, but they made plenty of other great music.<br /><br />During the period covered by this compilation, Queen also had four UK number two hits (Killer queen, Somebody to love, We are the champions and Crazy little thing called love) as well as five other UK top ten hits (Seven seas of Rhye, You're my best friend, Don't stop me now, Another one bites the dust, Flash).<br /><br />Impressive as this compilation is, Queen continued to make exciting music - enough to require two further volumes of greatest hits.
B000084T18|1.0|Howdy folks, Its jesus! Yeah, I just got back from chulak through the stargate, but dont go takin baths in the holy water or stuffin yourselves into bomb shelters full of canned vegetables just yet............  <br />      I don't really like what man has done with his idea of entertainment. I can forgive marilyn manson. BUT THIS? <br />I've been downloadin' a lot of pirated mp3s lately I know what I <br />B speakin of!!! Lets break down a rap song into bear elements: <br />1. Lyrics about how dangerous the rapper is, how rich he is <br />   and how many times he has been shot. Something his average <br />   middle class, suburban fifteen year audience cannot and will  <br />   not ever relate too. <br />2. A producer with a computer like mine who pastes <br />   a little rick james here, some stevie wonder here and composes <br />   an entire \\"Beat\\" that is'nt his! \\"Thou shalt not covet thy  <br />   neigbors work and call it original\\"-Somewhere in that  <br />   book verse 12:12 <br />3. A fan base that asks for nothing more out of the garbage they <br />   stuff in their Ears, wasting money on music like this they  <br />   can only get drunk and dance too. They are never truly moved <br />   by the beauty of the artist- He has nothing truly worthwhile <br />   to say or illustrate, idolized by an audience that could care less anyway. <br />     So see ya guys, I'm gonna blow up my heavenly father on my cellie and let him know I'm commin back....ALONE. Thats my word, <br />maybe if ya'll cherished some real tallent like michael jackson <br />or the fine acting of paul reubens, I might reconsider this return thing, but until then I'm out.....PEACE!!
B000060MWU|4.0|Jealous husband kills wife and while waiting to be executed he imagines his life as a James Dean type stud who sleeps with local gangster's hot girlfriend as opposed to the pathetic cuckold he believes himself to be, then he dies via electrocution. Quasi-fascinating, slow-moving film that begs for careful watching.
B00069A5GY|4.0|At first I felt this CD deserved no more than 3 stars, but after listening once in a while  for 3 weeks, I realized that I was falling in love with it. There are still some songs that only deserve 3 stars, other get five.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Neo hangs out, not doing much while a bunch of lameasses talk and mess around and wait for Neo to save them yet again, then he dies. The end. Atrocious storyline, boring scenes, bad acting, uninspired garbage, as if written by a matrix-hater to ruin the original. <br /> <br />It's no longer \\"What is the Matrix?\\" It's, \\"Where is the Matrix?\\" That's what everyone would like to know.
B000002P7R|3.0|The main purpose of South Saturn Delta is to give fans previously unreleased or long out-of-print songs. This is a good idea, but the actual quality of the songs on here isn't very good. Many are mediocre jams or rough drafts of songs. But there are some highlights, for sure. The most interesting song on the compilation is the title track, which gives incredible insight into Jimi's combination of blues, jazz, rock and R&B, as pointed out in the CD's accompanying booklet. Also well worth noting is the closing track \\"Midnight Lightning\\", where Jimi pays homage to his blues heros. One of the most promising songs here, \\"Sweet Angel\\", begins with the music already in progress. The complete version can be found on the 2000 4-cd box set \\"The Jimi Hendrix Experience.\\" And, ultimately, the box set is a MUCH better buy than this, despite the big price difference. The box set has random lost Hendrix songs that are actually VERY high in quality, and unforgettable, unlike a lot of the tunes on SSD. If you're a Hendrix fan, you should be willing to make that purchase.
0060763280|4.0|Having both attended the MMI weekend and read the book, I'll offer my two cents worth.  <br /> <br />The author can quickly start to grate on you if you don't enjoy being browbeaten. It's his way of speaking. You will either love or hate him for it. Don't expect any human warmth from him. It's just not there. <br /> <br />He also exaggerates his own success tenfold. Frankly, his story of building his sports business for three years and then selling it for $1.6 million is not all that impressive.  <br /> <br />$1.6 million after three years.  <br /> <br />Whoop-dee-doo!!!  <br /> <br />No big deal. <br /> <br />Nothing to see here, people. Run along. <br /> <br />He also exaggerates his current wealth. Harv, you need to grasp that saying things like, \\"I'm a multi-multi-multi-multi-multi-multi-multi millionaire many times over,\\" makes you sound uneducated. <br /> <br />Still, his system for displacing limiting beliefs around money with productive ones has sound psychological under-pinings and works. <br /> <br />Invest in the book and take the seminar. <br /> <br />You can't go wrong.
B0007P3582|2.0|I can say I am definitely not a 50 Cent fan, and this CD does very little to change my opinion of his musical talent. I will admit he has great beats on the CD, but still his rapping skills definitely leave some to be desired. I would highly suggest artists such as Jim Jones, Young Buck, and Tru as better new CDs in the gangsta rap genre. Save your money and listen to a friends copy of this CD before buying it, due to some might really like it but i personally feel I could have spent the money on a better CD.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin Degraw is so amazingly talented. This album is great.. and his shows are even better. I higly recommend this album to anybody who loves real, honest music. The Chariot cd is great but i personally love the stripped version better, so i recommend buying the chariot with the stripped. This is one of those cds where i love every song on there, which doesn't happen much for me. there is so much more behind \\"I Don't Want to Be\\" thats played on the radio so much... BUY THIS ALBUM!! you won't regret it.. its amazing.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Tom Waits is one of the few true music geniuses of our time.  I will admit, however, that he is an acquired taste.  The first time you here a Tom Waits album, you don't know whether to grin with glee, or cringe.  But once you get used to his style, his music puts a spell on you. <br /> <br />I had heard a little Tom Waits here and there, through friends, and liked it but never bought a full album.  Then on a whim I bought Mule Variations, and I was floored.  He's the type of artist who needs a full album to really represent him well.  And I am currently in the process of getting my hands on everything he's ever done, and I haven't really been dissappointed yet.  He has never gone with the flow of conventional music, and his albums are timeless.  Buy Swordfishtrombones or Rain Dogs and play them for someone who has never heard of Tom Waits, and I'll bet they'd never guess those albums are from the early eighties, they don't even really sound like they could be made today, which I guess would pretty much be the definition of timeless.  Anyway, if you like interesting music, it doesn't get any better than Tom Waits, but don't just buy this album, buy them all.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow does deserve credit in the visual effects department. A lot of the CGI in this film is just beautiful. But as it succeeded in producing eye opening visuals, its storyline was unmatched in strength. The plot was weak overall and rather formulaic. Another thing that made me mad about this flick was that Agelina Jolie, as it seemed to me, was advertised in the trailers as a major character in the film. I actually expected her to be the Sky Captain or the villian, but as it turned out she had a very minor role and had about 10 minutes of show time.<br />If you're into $150 million dollar budgets that are overflowing with special effects and action scenes and you could care less about story or character development, this one's for you. If you are not easily distracted by massive visuals in a movie and pay attention to storyline, you might or might not want to skip this one.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|I heard so many good things about this band and after hearing Take Me Out I had to go out and buy this CD.  But after listening to it the only other song I liked was Darts Of Pleasure.  The whole ablbum is pure nonsense and just plain annoying with mediocre songs.  I listened to this album several times to see if it would grow on me and it didn't.  This album is dreadful and fails to inspire.
B0001VWP8I|3.0|This is closer to a 4 star cd for me, but there are a couple of so-so songs that I really don't click with. \\"Time\\" is one of them. For me, it really doesn't have a memorable hook. \\"Left Outside Alone\\" and \\"Sick and Tired\\" more than make up for that though. \\"Sexy Single\\" and \\"Pretty Little Dum Dum\\" are other good songs on the cd. This album really rocks and I wish Anastascia were as big a star here as she is in Europe. This album is available for download at \\"Puretracks.com\\" for 11.99 if you don't want to buy the import version at a higher price, or wait until June when it is scheduled to (finally) come out here. No matter how you buy it, it is well worth the money.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|I thought is was a very good movie that i could watch over and over. I do not care what other people said about this movie, if i were you i would rent it and see if you like it for yourself and if you do then buy it.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Most of the people who wrote those other reviews, just don't get it and never will.  If you come into Frances the Mute expecting At the Drive-In then you won't get it.  There is a reason At the Drive-In broke up you know, Cedric and Omar got tired doing the kind of music they were doing.  And it only makes sense.  AtD-I while infinetly entertaining to the ears, wasn't always that deep.  While Frances the Mute is probably about the deepest and most in-depth cd I have ever listened too.  The entire cd tells a story.  In reading the lyrics and how involved they are, how cedric takes every symbol and ties it together throughout the album, I have come to the conclusion that he is probably the greatest lyricist ever in exsistense.  The more and more you analyze this album, the better it gets.  Everytime I listen to it I pick up something else.  And the words don't just tell the story by themselves, the music and artwork help as well.  Once you know what your listening to, it is probably the most moving cd I have ever heard.  Those expecting mindless rocking out, be dissapointed.  Those expecting deep thought out lyrics, music that moves you to no end and just about the greatest concept album ever made, jump for joy, because here it is.
B0007O38F8|5.0|Okay...  Just got the new album and listened through it. I think its an awesome album.  I am a hip hop fiend and there is not another album out there that I would put before this one. Everyone with their slandering thoughts should record their own rap and publish it, so we can degrade it.  If you aint rapping, shut up.
0312330529|5.0|An amazing story based entirely on the facts of the author's life in Bombay's slums and gangster undergroud.  Although over 900 pages, you will wish it did not have to end.<br /><br />The story and characters are wonderfully compelling.  It is all here; violence, love, intrigue, pathos, and laughter.  Roberts' prose grovels in the gutter then soars to the poetic.<br /><br />You will understand India better than if you were to visit as a tourist.  You may view Bombay as a teaming, seething, infested and deadly place.  You will be changed by Roberts.  His love and respect for Bombay and its amazing people will lead you to love the place.<br /><br />A rare treat of a book.  One that comes along only every few years.  Bravo and congratulations to Roberts.
B00000AFFF|5.0|Elvis breaths a fresh vitality and sensitivity into Bacharach's lastest to date cache of new songs. Elvis matched the grace and attention to Bacharachs sofisticatedly smooth stylings. I think if Burt could sing the way he would have loved to it would be like this. There's also a nice duet here. Master of many pop hit's, even in the eighties pop bands would cover Bacharach's songs/lyrics. He wrote so many songs that pepper our culture like raindrops keep falling on my head from the movie \\"Butch Cassidy & the Sun Dance kid\\" because he has (still has) a style of writing that is both completely polished yet still remains feeling almost spontaneous or many lucuid. (at the time of this recording) I never had heard Elvis sing like this before. He comes across on this album, and makes these songs his own like a Frank Sinatra... However many of my friends that liked Elvis from his early years poo-pooed this album and the contrast of years between these two - let alone the divergance that Elvis seemed to take in the sound of this project. But I don't think they gave the album a chance. But I must say you have to have some sort of apreciation of 60's 70's stlye of comtempary music. With that said I don't listen to much of that genre either but this album I have played many times cause it keeps on sounding so good! This CD for me is like a drug. I didn't even have the meodies in my head before I started craving to listen again and again. That's cause the melodies are somewhat complex at least when compared to the 3 & 4 Chord stuff the proliferates the airways. Don't get me wrong I do Love Rock but this is something different and special. It really got under my skin, and I think thats the ultimate compliment...<br /><br />B.T.W. there's a good CD of the pop hits by Bacharach available, just look at the song titles on it and you'll be like \\"I didn't know he wrote that?\\" --all the while hearing the version you know in your head.

0783225857|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is at the time of my writing this ranked at #41 on IMDb's top 250 list (of movies of all time.)<br />I haven't read Harper Lee's price-winning novel on which the movie is based, but watching the movie today (my second time in a year) reminded me of how much I wanted to experience the original story, in print, in addition to the film.<br />Gregory Peck, who'd started working on Broadway and in movies 20 years prior to this film, does a very stable and critically acclaimed (Oscar rewarded) performance as Atticus Finch - a small town lawyer who, in 1930's Southern America, is defending a colored man (accused for rape by a white woman) in court.<br />Much of this 1962 B&W movie, which incidentally includes Robert Duvall's film-debut, is played out through the eyes of Finch's motherless children, \\"Jem\\" and \\"Scout.\\"<br />I recommend it highly to anybody anywhere, regardless of age and culture, as it contains no \\"foul language\\" or \\"severe violence.\\" Sure - the story might not be very accessible to a five year old, but the content of the movie is not bound to hurt anyone. For all the viewer is aware, this could be a recreation of actual historic events, which it in a sense is.<br />The music, composed by Elmer Bernstein, undoubtedly suites the picture and partly reminds me of musical elements (harmonically and in instrumentation) from harp-dominated 1950's Ingmar Bergman pictures (such as \\"Smiles of a Summer Night.\\")<br />Though probably not within the incoming year or two, I'm sure I'm going to watch this movie again.<br />The well-restored sound and (widescreen) picture of this DVD features an insightful 90 minute long \\"making of\\" documentary as well as a theatrical trailer and biographies over the movie's main actors. There are also Spanish subtitles and a French audio track.<br />For a regular film-lover to leave this classic unwatched would be like killing a mockingbird.<br /><br />OBSERVE: This review, which I wrote in March 2005, was not for the gold cover Collector's Edition, for which the review currently appears!hich the review currently appears!

1932100385|5.0|I bought this book because of the excellent reviews it was getting and because of how much I enjoyed hearing Dr. Campbell speak about the China Study (the actual study, not the book) about three years ago. I was comfortably certain that I would enjoy the book, but what I didn't realize was how much I would learn from it! After listening to several lectures and reading many books and articles about the benefits of a plant-based diet and the harmful consequences of an animal-based one, as well as experiencing first-hand what a positive difference switching to a vegan diet makes, I didn't think there could be too much left on this topic to learn. I was mistaken! I gleaned new, interesting and important information from every chapter in this book, whether it was about nutrition, the mechanics of disease, or the disturbing details about what goes on behind the scenes as industry, medicine, science, government and business collude to spew out self-serving, deceptive and destructive \\"nutrition guidelines\\" for us hoi polloi. \\"The China Study\\" has inspired us to fine-tune our diet (already plant-based for nearly 5 years), and has me looking at things like pharmaceutical ads and medical study headlines (such as today's \\"Diabetics At Higher Liver Cancer Risk\\") with better informed, wider open eyes. While I already knew *that* a plant-based diet is healthier, this book explains in superb detail why and how that is the case... and despite the frequent complexity of the science, his explanations are clear and understandable - thanks in part to his excellent use of analogies. \\"The China Study\\" is well written, interesting and informative, engaging, sincere and forthright, and peppered throughout with a wonderful wry humor.<br /><br />I applaud Dr. Campbell's courage in speaking out against the status quo because he cares about the well-being of people and the planet, and am grateful to him (and his son) for sharing his hard-earned knowledge, behind-the scenes experience, and impressive expertise through this important book. Sometimes, when I read books like this one that credibly confront what we've been taught and what we think we know, challenging us to open our minds, think anew and hang on for the whoopsy wild ride of a paradigm shift, I am reminded of my high school history teacher's pet saying. When my class would do poorly on a pop quiz, he'd shake his head and mutter, \\"Buy 'em books and buy 'em books, and all they do is eat the covers.\\" I hope The China Study is widely read and influential, and that all anyone eats after being handed this book is plants. :-)pressive expertise through this important book.

B00000IFP6|5.0|I have 3 different Beethoven Nine Symphonies sets now:     (1) 'The Beethoven Collection' by Janos Ferencsik (ASIN: B000001VVY)  (2) 'Beethoven: The Nine Symphonies' by David Zinman (ASIN: B00000IFP6)  (3) 'Beethoven: 9 Symphonien' by Herbert von Karajan (ASIN: B000001GBQ).    The first one is a budget set and has taken early retirement since I acquired the latter two, which I found to be far superior.  Yet, there is a difference between the latter two.    The critically acclaimed David Zinman edition is slightly lightweight, but has the advantage of speed and dramatics and really grabs your attention.  For those times when I feel bored and need something exciting to perk me up, that's when I reach for the David Zinman edition.  It is Beethoven driven at a very fast pace, as mentioned by numerous others earlier.    The widely acknowledged 1963 Herbert von Karajan edition has a large grand orchestral sound which is warm and lush; I reach for it when I want to unwind and enjoy sweet orchestral music.  The quality of the recording is still excellent despite its age, and if you are coming over to classical music from smooth Jazz, this is an easier transition.    I strongly recommend these 2 sets - if you like your Symphonies hot and exciting go for the Zinman edition; if you want something warm and lush, go for the 1963 Karajan edition, or better still, grab both sets like me.
B0002ZDVF4|5.0|Matt Damon returns in this action-packed sequel to Bourne Identity reprising his role as the amnesiac Jason Bourne.<br /><br />As the movie unfolds, we see Jason and his girlfriend (played by Franka Potente) living in India.  But Jason continues to find himself plagued by memories from his past with the same questions in his mind: who exactly is he, what has he done and why are people trying to kill him?  Unfortunately for him, the mystery refuses to be solved in a peaceful way for tragedy strikes and he finds himself going back to Europe.  In his quest to find out more about his identity, he finds himself dodging bullets once again and killing more people in the process.  The stakes are surely higher this time around.<br /><br />Matt Damon gives another convincing performance in this follow up, with great support from Joan Allen, Brian Cox and Julia Stiles.  And the return of some characters from the first movie also provides that continuity, although you won't get lost if you haven't seen it.  With strong mystery, tense atmosphere and a focus on the plot rather than frivolous action, which we see a lot of in most action movies these days, this movie is a worthy sequel to Bourne Identity.  Fast-paced, it delivers what I have expected and makes me look forward to that inevitable part 3.  This is international espionage at its best and the character/story development is well executed making it smarter and sharper than your average spy movie.<br /><br />Some people have expressed dislike for the camera technique used.  Yes, there are some shaky camera work, wobbly and kind of blurred images.  And some of the close-ups may distract from the fight scenes, which apparently have some audience confused, but I didn't mind at all.  Personally, I find that it added to the chaos and confusion that were obviously the desired effects by the director.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />DVD Extras: deleted scenes, director's commentary, making-of featurettes etc.
0385510454|2.0|I have read every Grisham book except Bleachers and this was by far his worst.  Before this one I felt that The Client was his weakest and even that book kept me riveted to a degree.<br /><br />Nearly all of Grisham's books make the locale a part of the story ,but in this book the locale is too much of the story.  I wanted to read a suspense novel, not an Italian 101 language course.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|What a treat that this wacky 1938 screwball classic has finally come to DVD in pristine condition. Director Howard Hawks, a master of this genre as well as many others, guided this maddeningly incoherent and hilariously clever film, and he catches Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn at their zenith in buoyant comic energy and youthful vigor. Amazingly this was Hepburn's first real foray into farcical comedy, and she already seems like a master as she makes her exasperating character Susan Vance the definitive madcap heiress. She seems to be cross-channeling the pratfall wackiness of Lucille Ball with the Fifth Avenue glamour of Carole Lombard and filtering it all through her braying, haughty New England manner. It's a blazing performance that fits ideally within her dominating personality.<br /><br />Grant is her match as David Huxley, the befuddled, bespectacled paleontologist, who aptly describes his inadvertent relationship with Susan as \\"a series of misadventures from beginning to end\\". Together, they keep up with the breathless pace Hawks sets with a hair-brained plot involving an elusive research grant, a pet leopard that can only be soothed by one song (\\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby\\"), a mischievous dog with a yen for a missing intercostal clavicle (i.e., a dinosaur bone) and a gallery of comic character actors who make the mistake of trying to make sense of all the shenanigans. The veteran supporting cast is incomparably stellar, in particular, May Robson as no-nonsense Aunt Elizabeth, Charlie Ruggles as the likeably pompous Major Horace Applegate and Walter Catlett as the perennially confused Constable Slocum.<br /><br />What saves this piece of sheer lunacy from going permanently airborne is the crack timing of the comedy, the increasing sense of disaster with every scene and the inevitable romance between the two leads. The movie is filled with wonderful sight gags topped off by a collapsing dinosaur skeleton, and the sharp script (written by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde) has an abundance of clever lines and witty asides. In fact, much of the film's sensibility seems far ahead of its time with its contemporary treatment of sex role reversals, psychiatry and marriage, even using the term \\"gay\\" in a most appropriate context. It's a film that defies common sense, but its manic sense of absurdity and humiliation gives the movie its lasting appeal.  Director Peter Bogdanovich, who paid tribute to this film with his partial remake, \\"What's Up, Doc?\\", provides insightful commentary on an alternate track.  The second DVD contains two interesting documentaries, one on Grant, the other on Hawks. A must-see classic.ley Nichols and Hagar Wilde) has an abundance of clever lines and witty asides.

0143034901|5.0|I have read hundreds of books, but I've never been compelled to write a review before. But I loved this book! The prose is extraodinarily rich, giving so much tone and image to the novel. The story itself combines murder, mystery, comedy, and romance. I couldn't put this book down! For anyone who loves a book that makes you stay up all night so you can figure out the ending, you won't be disappointed!
B0007O38F8|4.0|That 50 cent album is made for the streets yall propley was expecting another GET RICH OR DIE TRYING, The Game and 50 they having some issues yall need to get off that Game and 50 beef and really listen to the niggas album!
B0006IUDXA|5.0|MacGyver is, as usual, entertaining and interesting.  Though there is no special features on this DVD set, season one of MacGyver is worth every penny anyway (and I'm not talking Penny Parker (Teri Hatcher).
B0000669JL|5.0|Get this now, and then check out everything else he made.  The whole cd flows very well, there is not a bad song on here.  This cd does not really showcase Bob Marley's music as a vehicle for social change, for that you should also get Rebel Music.  there are a lot of good cd's he put out, like Burnin and the like, that are well worth your attention.  But this will always be the perfect introduction to Bob Marley's reggea magic!
B0002IU988|3.0|When I heard \\"Open your Eyes\\" I was Blown away by how good it was. I couldnt wait for the day it would come out. I went to the store the first day it was released and when i got home to listen to it I was very happy with the first 3 songs. But then it got alittle to slow for my taste. The singers oohs and aahs start to get annoying after a while. Dont get me wrong there are a couple of really good songs but it was a bigg disapointment only 2 others songs sound like \\"Open your Eyes\\" the rest are very slow.
B000002IOW|3.0|I cannot recommend this cd, because everything except for \\"The Pass\\" just doesn't sound very good.  I really liked this the first few listens, but then I just thought the choruses and stuff were annoying.  I think that only a few people can really stand the repeat listens of this album, and though Presto is initially really good, Roll the Bones is way better.  The mastering and sparkly quality of the album detracts from its listenability.  If you want something better, get Roll the Bones, one of their best and most \\"popular\\" type cds.
0140288503|5.0|The book does an outstanding job of capturing the chaos of war in our modern times.  In the urban setting your first problem is finding out who the enemy is and then seeing them in the pandemonium of the city streets. <br /> <br />Bowden does his usual stellar job of giving us enough details about the main charachters to make us care and then his pacing and descriptions help build the suspense. <br /> <br />A very well done book.
B000001ESJ|4.0|this cd is not their best, but it consistently places high on Rush fans' lists of their best albums.  Personally I don't really like the well-known songs, because I think the arrangements aren't very well done, and Geddy's voice still annoyed me a bit at that time.  I wouldn't recommend buying it, instead you should get Different Stages because that has an old Hammersmith Odeon concert from the tour after this album, and the best songs from this cd are on the live set.  The only reason to get this cd is for Xanadu,  which is one of their best full-length songs.  If the songs \\"farewell to kings\\" and \\"closer to the heart\\" are of your liking, go ahead and get the cd, because then it is worth it.  But the 2 aforementioned songs are also on Chronicles, so consider that in your purchases.
0312330529|5.0|this is one of the finest book I have read in a long time.  A rather harsh story but eloquently written and totally captivating...hard to put down.  Truely sad to finish this book..you don't want it to ever end....so hard to find something as beautiful to follow.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've never seen the stage verison but I'v listened to the soundtrack to the play. I have to say the movie is the Best!!!:)<br /><br />I can't wait til I get the DVD and see the extra's. :D
B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard's Hysteria is my favorite rock album of all time and it's also the best rock album ever made!!! Def Leppard was my very first band I got into, my very first rock album was from Def Leppard, they are my favorite band of all time and always will be! After all these years, I can't just listen to Hysteria one time, each time I listen to this album, I have to listen to it multiple times because it is THE ROCK ALBUM!! I never get bored of listening to these songs and I totally love Joe Elliott's sexy voice (especially on Women), the amazing guitar solos by legend Steve Clark (R.I.P. Steve!), the talented one-armed drummer Rick Allen, everything!<br /><br />My favorites are Pour Some Sugar On Me which actually there were two different versions of the song. The album version starts out with \\"Step Inside, Walk This Way,You And Me Babe, Hey Hey!!\\" which is included in the Historia video and was never shown in the U.S. and then there's the video version which was from the In The Round, In Your Face live concert and I love them both!! (And as stated in The Vault album linear notes, Pour Some Sugar On Me is just about \\"pure SEX!!\\"), Love Bites (THE BEST rock ballad ever made and a #1 hit on Billboard!!), Women (I totally love Joe's vocals on this song and the way he sings is awesome!), Rocket (I love the long guitar solo!), Animal (I love how at the end of the song, you think it's over but it's not!), Armageddon It, Gods Of War (the dialog during this is so cool and it's like this totally epic song with long guitar solos, I love it!), Love And Affection, Excitable, Don't Shoot Shotgun, and Run Riot! I love this whole CD, and it's so unique, not like any rock/metal album I've ever heard!<br /><br />Def Leppard is just such a unique band because no two albums sound alike.  This CD is almost 20 years old and it's amazing how wonderful it is that it never gets old! A must buy for any rock fan!!! If you own only one rock CD, own Hysteria!!! You won't regret it!!!
B0001L3MI0|3.0|Roland Emmerich reminds me of Michael Bay: they don't make action films that have character and heart like Spielberg or Cameron, they just make popcorn films. Emmerich did a great job when he did Stargate and Universal Soldier but then made this and I have seen it 11 times already but each time I hate parts of it yet I always go back, go figure. <br /> <br />A massive ship(550 KM) appears in Earth's atmosphere and the US is scrambling to figure out what's going on. The ship then splits into about 15 smaller crafts but smaller's the wrong word since each one is 15 miles long anyway. Cities slowly start to evacuate until one scientist figures out(was that signal in morse code? Pretty smart aliens) that they're gonna fire on Earth. And boy do they. The cities literally get engulfed in building-high flames and destroys the city. <br /> <br />The president has to land at Area 51 and finds out that the aliens(in probably the dumbest plot contrivance ever) are going to destroy every city on Earth and move on. The aforementioned scientist figures out a way to beat them and to destroy the ships, they just have to go to Big Mama's ship first. <br /> <br />In terms of character development and a simple plot, there isn't one. Simple meaning that everything makes sense without you going \\"but how did?\\". Like when that scientist is able to hook up to the mothership with his laptop. My floppy disc can't even read Mac programs but his can link up with alien computers? BAH. What you do get though instead is big flashing and boomy stuff. Explosions, explosions and effects galore. It's certainly cool to watch but it just hurts your brain. <br /> <br />The acting pretty much sucks, bad dialogue, convenient plot turns but it sure does look neat.
B000001DV2|5.0|Up until 1992, I never liked hard rock or metal at all.  I was never into it.  Then one day I was watching MTV in 1992, Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad came on and I totally fell in love with Def Leppard and the song!  I bought the tape and it was my favorite and only hard rock album.  After a while, I bought Hysteria which is now my all time favorite hard rock/metal album.  But Adrenalize will always be up there with Hysteria.  Adrenalize has some of the best rock songs I've ever heard like Let's Get Rocked (awesome video by the way), Make Love Like A Man, Tonight, White Lighting (I totally love all the guitar solos), Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion), and Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad (My 2nd favorite rock ballad next to Love Bites).  But this album got me into other bands but Def Leppard are so unique and don't sound like any other band so they will always be my favorite.  Adrenalize is REAL ROCK!!!<br /><br />Another thing I don't understand is a lot of people keep saying that Def Leppard are not very talented.  How can they not be talented when Def Leppard was one of very few hard rock bands from the 80's that had a #1 hit on Billboard with Love Bites?  And the fact that Rick Allen lost his arm and didn't just give up like most people would have.  I know a lot of people would just quit drumming if they lost an arm but not Rick Allen.  He found a way to keep drumming.  I think Def Leppard have more talent than many other bands out there.  Def Leppard always has these epic songs with long guitar solos like Die Hard The Hunter, White Lightning, Gods Of War, and Paper Sun.<br /><br />Euphoria was another masterpiece!  Def Leppard is very underrated and this album especially is very underrated and it totally sounds Def Leppard to me.  They don't sound like Backstreet Boys or New Kids On The Block, they are ROCK people!!!
0060955775|5.0|Read it in spanish. Interesting and with a very good message. One of my favorites.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I finally saw this last night and was underwhelmed, to say the least. I think an earlier reviewer had it right when he said the story was trite and the movie as a whole didn't feel authentic. The whole thing struck me overall as being sort of cartoonish. I admit that Bill the Butcher was fun to watch. As played by Daniel Day Lewis, he's a laff riot of pure hamminess, which is strangely appropriate in this context. But I disagree with the last reviewer about Leonardo Di Caprio. Di Caprio is good in contemporary American roles (Catch Me If You Can, This Boy's Life) but he isn't at all convincing as a gang leader in the slums of New York circa 1860. For one thing, he's too soft-looking and whiny-sounding. And the critics are right about the ending. It really is kind of tacky to take a real historical atrocity like the draft riots totally out of context and use it just as a flashy backdrop for a lame showdown between Lewis and Di Caprio. Gangs of New York is a big disappointment from the director who gave us Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, and Goodfellas.  <br /> <br />About the DVD - The movie is spread out over two discs. This makes it almost twice as expensive as a single disc of a movie (and Gangs could easily fit on one disc). The extras are okay, but not all that interesting, not worth the big increase in price. If they had to include all these extras, they should have put them on a separate disc, so you wouldn't have to change discs in the middle of the movie (which is kind of annoying). The transfer is nice, with excellent picture quality and color balance.
B0007P3582|1.0|THIS IS NOT REAL HIP HOP. <br /> <br />THIS IS GARBAGE. <br /> <br />
B000022TSH|4.0|Look at the cast (Nicholson, Huston, Dunaway). Look at the director (Polanski). I will be so bold as to call Chinatown a classic. It fits the bill. <br /> <br />This is another movie that I had wanted to see for a long time that I never got around to renting.  <br /> <br />I am having a hard time articulating what I liked so much about this one, but believe me when I say that I really liked it. <br /> <br />I love the mysteries throughout which you are constantly trying to sleuth along side the main character(s). My favorites, however, are the ones that take you in circles. I want plot twists. I want to be led in directions that end up being dead ends. I want to be left surprised at the ending, admitting that I never saw it coming. <br /> <br />Though I was not surprised at the ending of Chinatown, there certainly were plenty of twists in the plot. A longer movie, at more than 2 hours, that never dragged; Chinatown did not disappoint. <br /> <br />The movie was also extremely aesthetically pleasing. No, I am not referring to Faye Dunaway...entirely. The style chosen for the film was using muted colors and accenting a few greens, blues, yellows and pinks. The stark contrast between the dull scenes and strategically placed vivid colors was great. <br /> <br />A great movie at a great price. I will certainly be adding Chinatown to my collection.
0345475674|4.0|I enjoyed this book greatly. It's fast paced, fun reading. Fascinating subject matter, which is handled adroitly by the author. The book conveyed a sense of society at the time as well as conveying how the impending disaster was probably treated by the area residents. An enjoyable read.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|The \\"Day After\\"deals with a potential Nuclear War during the early to mid eighties - the last stage of the Cold war.<br /><br />For the first hour or so, we get to know a cross section of the population near Kansas City - from doctors & academics to farmers & their families. Even in the days leading to the bombing, people go on with their lives as though nothing was wrong - going to football games, taching classes, planning weddings...<br /><br />Then the bombs fall - and the survivors have to rebuild their lives - first stay in closd spaces until the radiation count goes down, then go on with their lives - running a hospital when many are wounded, farming while dealing with earth filled with radioactive materials, dealing with tresspassersm but most of all - missing the people that were lost.<br /><br />Whilethe movie does portray many of the effects of a nuclear blast, it did pull some punches unlike its British Counterpart \\"Threads\\". It also hadn't shown the long term effects a nuclear war would have, such as nuclear winter, the rise of cancer cases, or the further detirioration of society.<br /><br />Even though I'm sure the quality of the movie & effects were good for 1984 made for TV movie, it does look bad compared to modern effects...
B000002UAO|5.0|\\"Plastic Soul\\" was a term many black-American bluesmen used for white-Englishmen who used their music and style in the 60's.  \\"Rubber Soul\\" was the Beatle's response.  Though not technically a blues album, it does have quite a bit of that Ray Charles soul sound on numbers like the rocking \\"Drive My Car\\" and John's \\"Girl.\\"  But what's truely impressive is the restraint the Beatles possessed to even make this album. <br /> <br />The band was already mega-successful prior to this album.  Fans worshipped, shows sold out, and obsessives bought up any type of memorabilia available.  The Beatles are famous for noting around 1964-65 that they could no longer hear themselves when they played live due to screaming girls.  This album is that transition from heart-throbs to studio-experts.  The equivalent would be N'Sync promising to play classical back in 2000.  Anything prior to this is simple, poppy, Beatlemania.  \\"Rubber Soul\\" (and post '65) is the thinking man's Beatles.  Listen to the depth on \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and \\"Nowhere Man,\\" the Phil Spector-nod \\"Michelle,\\" or the Elvis rip \\"Run For Your Life.\\"  No less than six of the songs here were released as singles, if the red album is historically accurate.  The Beatles changed their game plan for the second half of the 60's and this is the huddle. <br /> <br />Overall:  9 out of 10.
0441009425|5.0|Revelation Space has often been described as modern Sci-Fi's new brand of the space opera, but I think the description sells the book short. Alastair Reynolds through his writing of Revelation  Space creates a universe that is quickly accessible to both hardcore and casual Sci-Fi readers. Furthermore, the universe that Reynolds does create has comfortable elements that many Sci-Fi readers can quickly relate to and also incorporates ideas and technical imagery that go far beyond the normal Sci-Fi, creating a universe so tangible that it's impossible not to get completely sucked in.  <br /> <br />Any worries about the nearly 600 pages of this book should be disregarded, by the last page of this epic, sweeping story the reader will be wishing for another 600.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  If you are looking for something upbeat that will have your toe tapping and put a smile on your face, look no further.  This album shows how a decade can bring maturity without taking away the fun!
B00006RJHG|5.0|This is a wonderful scary movie and well done.  Does anyone know if Jess gets killed in the end?   They sort of leave you wondering.  Thanks
0064400018|5.0|I love this series and I've been collecting them now for a number of years.<br /><br />The story begins with Laura Ingalls growing up in the Big Woods of Wisconsin with her family. This book tells all about how they played, harvested, made cheese, went to sugaring off dances and how Pa hunted.<br /><br />It gives a very accurate description of what life was like \\"in those days\\". I'm a teenager and I still love reading these books. In fact, I like them more now than when I was 7 or 8! Awesome books and I hope you'll take the time to read them.
B0007P3582|1.0|I really can't believe Dre or Eminem let this garbage get released under their labels.  50 Cent I understand, he doesn't know any better.  50 was whining so much about Dre working on Game's album instead of his that he got impatient and got wack producers.  \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\" is the only thing I can listen to on the whole album.  Go somewhere and listen to the snippets, 30 seconds is all you need to realize how horrible this is.  And that beef with Game was all an attempt to start controversy and sell albums.  50 committed lyrical suicide with this one, I hope he doesn't wake up this time.
B00004W50T|5.0|When I learned who The Band were, I figured the moniker came from their fame as \\"the band\\" that used to back up Dylan.  Later in life, when I joined a band and was faced with the insurmountable impossibility of naming it, I figured they got tired just like I did and decided on the first thing that came into their head. (Apparently, \\"Mean Phoenix\\" was the first thing that came into my head.  Not a good name, though.)  Now that I'm a very old man (25) and am fairly well versed in the history of rock and/or roll, I know the method behind the name.  It's a generic term for \\"the people's band,\\" as in \\"the band\\" we all like, or \\"the band\\" that plays music that sounds like my life.  With a little more persuation, we could say there's Dylan, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, and then there's \\"THE BAND,\\" i.e. the band of all bands.  I don't really believe all that.  My point is that if you've lived or currently live in America and you crave music that speaks for everyman in a more simple, a more moral time, then this is \\"the band\\" for you.  And \\"Music From Big Pink\\" is the album.  From \\"tears of rage\\" to \\"chest fever,\\" from the classic single \\"the weight\\" to Dylan collaboration \\"I shall be Released\\" this is music that sounds and acts like music of a generation and beyond.  Looks like they painted their masterpiece years before they sang about it. <br /> <br />Overall:  10 out of 10.
B00067189O|5.0|As a long time Miles fan, truthfully I thought this was another ploy by the record companies to make money. Since I already own \\"Kind Of Blue\\" on album and cd, I wasn't in a rush to purchase this new disc. I was in my local cd store and noticed that they had it on sale so I purchased it. When I went home and played the dvd audio on my dvd system I was really surprised by the separation of instruments and the clarity of the sound. I recommend this cd to all Miles fans and hope that Columbia will release more of Miles' catalog in this dualdisc format.
B00005ASHM|3.0|I want to state right from the start that I have never been a Beach Boys fan.  I have never liked their sound or style.  I admire their talent and musicianship, but I simply never cared for their music.  You see I agree with the analysis of Uma Thurman's character in the movie \\"Pulp Fiction\\" that there is two different types of men, a Beatles man and an Elvis man.  However, I take that opinion a step further.  There are three different types of people: Beatles people, Elvis people, and Beach Boys people.  I am most definitely a Beatles person.  Understand that this analysis is kind of like comparing apples to oranges but there it is (it's simply a matter of preference).  So what is the point to all this?  Well my point is, regardless of how you feel about the Beach Boys, Pet Sounds is a phenomenal piece of music.  The harmonies are intricate, the compositions are innovative and a classic example of what I consider the Beach Boys sound.  That is why, because I am a Beatles person, I detest this recording.  I find it sappy and nauseating and the very reason I don't like the Beach Boys.  However, if you are a Beach Boys person and you do not own Pet Sounds then you really need to because this recording is why this band will always be legendary.  Like it or not, it is an extraordinary piece of music from the days of California Psychedelia.  Pet Sounds is the best that the Beach Boys ever had to offer and why it will stand the test of time. For that alone Pet Sounds deserves at least three stars.
0440241413|5.0|Ok. I did read the books out of order. I read Shopaholic Bride because I was newly married at the time. I thought well if I like this one I will buy the others. OH my God! I live 3 hours from a decent bookstore. I kicked myself three or four times. How can I get the other books? I wanted to read about Becky and her crazy finances. I am hooked. So I went to a bookstore that is ok and I found Shopaholic Manhattan and shopaholic and sister, but I couldn't find Confessions of Shopaholic. I was so disappointed. Well I found Confessions on the internet. Thank God! I have to say Confessions blew my mind away! How can she spend so much? It is the best. I love Sophie!!
B00005Y1TL|3.0|Techno, ambient, and dance music circles have been oozing over this album for 12 years citing it as the start of modern electronica and trip hop, among other things.  All praise and influence webs aside, the album does hold up fairly well.  But many of the artists influenced by Aphex Twin have albums that are much more enjoyable today.  That's not to say the music isn't inspiring or well executed, even by today's standards.  But if we could go back and fall all over ourselves about another album in a similar genre that's just as good or better, we probably would (think Massive Attack \\"Blue Lines\\"). <br /> <br />The tracks gel into one very LONG suite.  Depending on your mood you will either be so impressed you won't know what to do with yourself, or you'll reach for the stop button.  If you average out your moods, you'll probably come up with the same conclusion as this critic; this is good music if taken in small doses. <br /> <br />Overall:  6 out of 10.
B0007P3582|4.0|Overall, this is a very good album, with some nice beats, and some good rapping by 50, but it is not what we expected from him after hearing \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\". On \\"Get Rich...\\" almost every one of 50's songs was a hit. With \\"The Massacre\\" he has some hot songs, but not as many. This album lacks some of the enthusiastum that 50 put into \\"Get Rich....\\" Other reviews on the album I've read all seemed to trash this album, but it's not really that bad. Just a \\"new sound\\" for 50. Very different from his last album, but different isn't always a bad thing. Here's my opinion on each song: <br />1. Intro - Not much to say about that...  <br />2. In My Hood - 3/5 A good song, but probably just an album filler. <br />3.  This is 50 - 3/5 Also, a good song, with some better rapping from 50, but again, I don't think it's all that great. <br />4.  I'm Suppost to Die tonight - 4/5 This is where the album starts to get good. Lyrics are pretty good, and the beat is HOT. <br />5.  Piggy Bank - 5/5 Many people already know this song, in where 50 trashes a lot of rival rappers, like Fat Joe, Nas, Jada etc. <br />6.  Gatman and Robbin' ft. Eminem - 2/5 Enough said. This song has a weak beat and weak rapping. Not one of his better songs.  <br />7.  Candy Shop ft. Olivia - 5/5 I'm sure every 50 fan has heard this song. A hot song, with hot lyrics, and some nice help from Olivia. <br />8.  Outta Control - 5/5 This song has one of the best beats on the album. It will get you up and moving. One of my favorites. <br />9.  Get in My Car - 4/5 The lyrics could have been slightly better, but the beat has a catchy beat and this song is pretty good. <br />10.  Ski Mask Way - 2/5 I don't know which is worse. The beat or the lyrics. <br />11.  A Baltimore Love Thing - 4/5 This is a really nice song by 50. The lyrics are EXCELLENT, but the beat could use some work. <br />12.  Ryder Music - 5/5 Excellent all the way around. The beat is definetly one of the best on the album. <br />13.  Disco Inferno - 3/5 Only because this song is getting played out, but it is the song that started this whole album. <br />14.  Just a Lil Bit - 5/5 This is a great song with the best beat on the album. It will be in your head all day long. <br />15.  Gunz Come Out - 4/5 Decent song, and I think it's in the top 5 of the album. <br />16.  My Toy Soldier ft. Tony Yayo - 3/5 The title sounds like 50 is just taking Eminem's song and \\"changing\\" it a little, but really, it's totally different. An OK song. <br />17.  Position of Power - 5/5 This is my FAVORITE song on the album. It's great ALL the way around. Good rapping, sound, beat. It's just a great song. <br />18.  Build You Up ft. Jamie Foxx - 2/5 This song just makes no sense to have Jamie Foxx in it. It's just a horrible song to begin with, but I think 50 could of handled it himself. <br />19.  God Gave me Style -4/5 This sounds like one of 50's old song from \\"Get Rich...\\" which makes it to me, one of the best. <br />20.  So Amazing ft. Olivia - Finally a love song by 50 that sounds good. This song may be a little fast for a love song, but it's has a hot beat. <br />21.  I Don't Need 'Em - 3/5 An OK song. Not the best to pick to end the album, but it's good.  <br />BONUS TRACK - Hate It or Love It remix ft. G~Unit - 5/5 This is even better than the original!! It has all of G~Unit in it, and souds hott. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is a really good album and worth the money. Some songs may be rushed, but the ones that aren't are DEFINETLY worth it.
B000022TSY|1.0|This is another work of liberal propoganda from the sixtys  <br />designed to encourage children to turn on their country, <br />drop out and use drugs. <br /> <br />The story (if you can call it that) has two drug dealers riding <br />motorcycles across the american west.  They are smuggling drugs <br />the whole way.  Its less a movie than a music video because <br />nobody in the film can really act.  Endless motocycle panoramas <br />set to music followed by a seemingly endless trip-out scene <br />where our boys play around in a graveyard with whores and <br />mock the idea of religion.   <br /> <br />The film is full of the liberal paranoid view of America.  That <br />Americans who work, have families, have jobs, are clean and <br />don't do drugs sit around all day plotting how to kill everyone <br />else.  Its always news to them, but real Americans are far too <br />busy working and living their lives to care much about what <br />a bunch of deadbeats are up to. <br /> <br />Peter Fonda spends the whole film in love with himself.  I can <br />imagine after every take him pulling out a mirror and grooming <br />himself.  The other guy (Hopper) is a dirtball.  He must have <br />been out of it nearly the whole time because they go out of their <br />way to reduce his lines down to nothing.  Nicholson is the only <br />person in the movie who can half-way act, and at best he gives <br />a B-grade supporing character actor performance.   <br /> <br />And by hippie-liberal logic, since Nicolson is the only actor <br />here, he gets the least screen time and gets killed off real <br />quick.  As is always the case under socialism, the punishment <br />for showing that your better than other people is severe. <br /> <br />At the end of the film, our druggie heros get shot to death <br />out on the road by regular america for no reason.  The day <br />before they get shot, Fonda tells the dirty guy \\"we blew it\\" <br />forshadowing that they were going to be punished and killed. <br />By liberal logic, Hopper and Fonda blew it (and brought death <br />on themselves) because as noble as liberals consider drug  <br />smuggling, it also could be considered work.  Work for <br />these kind of guys is the ultimate crime against nature. <br /> <br />This film and its two dirtballs turn the concept of freedom <br />around.  Freedom was never about freedom from work or freedom <br />to use lots of drugs.  Freedom is about opportunity, not <br />being a parasite. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMEW|4.0|I generally don't review movies but I feel that the Kill Bill series begs for my two cents.    Volume One has all of the classic elements of that make Tarantino a fixture in edgy modern cinema.    To begin with I will point out something that often goes unsaid. Music and soundtracks often are overlooked when it comes to their impact on a film.  In this movie, the choice of sounds and music is perfect.  (Almost like a movie by Cameron Crowe).  While this doesn't contain songs by Pearl Jam or the flavor of the month, a perfect example is the scene (a la Reservoir Dogs) when Lucy Liu's band of bad asses shows up on scene in a local joint in Japan.  This blends perfectly into the music of a Japaneese pop band which entertains the customers...that is until something happens.    I don't wish to give away the plot and surprise secrets of this film (as it is some of the brilliance of which makes the movie) but suffice to say the movie is raw, edgy and has a hint of empowerment of women as a theme.    Some of the things that happen to Uma Thurman are raw and horrific but again, not placed in the film for sheer shock value.    The pace of the film is epic and the culmination of the film simply leaves one asking...why end it here...where is the conclusion...ah...one must wait until Kill Bill volume 2.    What else can be said without giving the movie away (as I am sure others who have reviewed the film have done).    Art direction.  The choice of colors, and scenes and shots is akin to another great...Stephen Soderburgh.  There is simply so much going on in the film making in this movie...it deserves to be ranked as one of the better films of this generation.  There is comedy (such as a scene between Uma and a sushi chef...and his assistant).  And the subtlety of the movie is not to be overlooked.    Enjoy this movie!
B00005ASHM|5.0|People tend to glorify their rock and roll idols.  We think that \\"genious\\" is just as fitting a word for a Tool album as it is for advances in heart surgery.  We look more fondly upon Bono and Bruce Springsteen than we do our own fathers.  Some pretend that rock can really save the world when deep down, we all know it can't.  Reason is not always the music lovers ally, myself included. <br /> <br />Having said that, I don't find anything wrong with giving proper credit where it's due.  So I can say, without any reserve, justification, or apology, that this album is perfect.  Every note.  From the psychedelic piano/rain effects of \\"Wouldn't it Be Nice\\" to the sobering, lovelorn \\"Caroline No.\\"  It is amazing what we humans can create.  \\"I Know There's an Answer\\" seems to ask if there's something more, while Brian Wilson tries to convince us he \\"just wasn't made for these times.\\"  \\"Sloop John B\\" is one of the greatest singles of all-time.  And though I know I'm not the first to mention \\"God Only Knows\\" as being the first rock song to mention God in its title, you'll have a hard time convincing me that I'm not the most dismayed that we're approaching a time when mentioning God at all is taboo.  This album reminds us of a more simple time.  Happiness, joy, and harmony...  These things should have always been a part of rock and roll. <br /> <br />Overall:  10 out of 10.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|First, I like Hugh Jackman, I really do.  I dug him in the [[ASIN:B000HEVZ9E X-Men]] films, and in [[ASIN:B000E5KJFC Swordfish]]], etc.  I wanted this to work for him, and I wanted to enjoy him in it.  But by the time the credits rolled on this over-the-top, typical modern Hollywood F/X-in-search-of-a-story dreck, I was almost embarrassed for him.  This movie is so bad, on so many levels.<br /><br />First, it's every traditional horror movie monster you ever loved and/or were scared of, smashed together in a ridiculously contrived and confusing saga in which Frankenstein somehow holds the key to giving life to Dracula's Babies of the Dead.  Does that sound ridiculous?  Well, that's essentially what we've got here, and this doesn't even account for the ancient family curse, the Wolfman angle, and the ancient Vatican mercenary force which guards the world against all manner of evil . . . blah blah blah.  Absolutely preposterous schlop, through and through.<br /><br />The movie is all F/X and CGI backgrounds, and more F/X, and more backgrounds, and ridiculous acrobatic fighting and motions.  It's just as bad as the absurd acrobatics in that second [[ASIN:B00005JLYW Charlie's Angels]] monstrosity.  Everything happens perfectly, everything is in sync, all of the right things happen for the good guys, and all of the wrong things happen for the bad guys, just when they're needed.  Lots of totally inexplicable and lame plot devices, just to keep the ridiculous story moving along, and to get us from one scene to another.<br /><br />I watched this film--a number of times, actually--on a 15-hour plane flight from Hong Kong to New York.  It killed time on the flight, sure, but by the time the credits rolled, I was genuinely glad that it was over, and that I was no longer subjected to the subtly insulting devices and diversions, the over-the-top and ridiculously impossible action and stunts and CGI-provided points of views and movements that Hollywood in general and these producers and this director specifically figure I'll just accept, grinning stupidly over my extra-large popcorn.<br /><br />If you're into shallow, internally contradictive, mindless horror films, with lots of over-the-top CGI, then this is for you.  If you've got half a brain, and find yourself asking connective and conjectural questions about characters' movements, motivations, and other simple observations that really shouldn't arise when you're supposed to be suspending your disbelief for a cinematic experience, then this flick is not going to work for you, just as it didn't work for me.ecifically figure I'll just accept, grinning stupidly over my extra-large popcorn.

B00003CXA4|5.0|I do not need to elaborate on what a great quality film this is.  It has the awards to prove it.  Neither do I need to comment on the quality of Gandhi, the man.<br /><br />BUT I HAVE A GREAT IDEA!<br /><br />I just watched this film with my Jr. High aged daughter.  What an opportunity to show the next generation a hero that changed the world WITHOUT violence!<br /><br />Don't waste this opportunity.  Show this movie to a young person and take time to talk with them about it.  My daughter and I got on the web and researched Gandhi's life.  The pictures we saw looked much like portions of the movie.<br /><br />This is certainly a cut above the films we normally watch.
B00005R24G|5.0|The title of this movie has always seemed to compleatly fail to capture the spirit of this film. I've always thought the movie should be called 'Only A Game'. Sleuth sounds like some standard detectives fair and this is not standard. The movie is a game and it is about games and Anthony Shaffer is playing a game with the audiance.<br /><br />It is hard to describe the film without giving away a twist or turn but the begining is fairly safe. Milo Tindel (Michael Caine) is invited to the country manner of Alaxander Wake (Laurance Olivier). Wake is a rather bizarre eccentric obsessed with games, the gentry, and his own unaturaly large ego. Tindel is almost his poler opposite. Tindel came from a poor background and was the son of an impoverished Itlalian watch maker. Wake who seems to have had the world handed to him on a aristocratic plate were as Tindel is a struggling self made bussness man.<br /><br />Wake announces to Tindel three things: he knows Tindel is having an affair with his wife, he doesn't care, and he's willing to help Tindel commit insurance fraud if he'll just take Margarite off his hand. The film then decends into a series of twits and turns which I will not metion.<br /><br />The back bone of this film is the actors. Both Caine and Olivier were nomanated for the oscar that year and they both deserved the nomination. They make all the fantastical games playing seem real and add energy to the story (which play adaptations usualy are lacking). Their perfect for their roles in this intricate game of class war fare.<br /><br />This is one of the best
B000093BDX|4.0|Though not a huge Beach Boys fan, I prefer some of the other albums to this \\"best of\\" collection; \\"Smile,\\" \\"Pet Sounds,\\" and \\"Today.\\"  But I can certainly appreciate some of the greatest singles ever put in one place, and wouldn't hesitate in suggesting new fans to check this out first. <br /> <br />Though many songs are omitted in favor of inferior singles (as any rabid fan will tell you), much of the material on here can be said to be their best without objection.  What could be better than \\"Heroes and Villians,\\" \\"Good Vibrations,\\" \\"Sloop John B,\\" \\"Surfer Girl,\\" and \\"In My Room?\\"  Some of the very late and very early stuff seems trite now, but in the mid-60's almost no one was better; this compilation has many of those classic-era Beach Boys songs.  Until something better is extricated, this is an excellent place to start. <br /> <br />Overall:  8 out of 10.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|Like many I anticipated The Mars Volta follow up to De-Loused. I often wondered how they could top the creativity of De-Loused. And the jury is still out on that one. Sure Frances the Mute is a creative work, if you like recordings that are two thirds actual music and one third meandering techno psycho babble.     The song \\"The Widow\\" is a microcosm of what Frances the Mute is all about. Its a great song that only lasts about three and a half minutes, that was unecessarily fused with three minutes of meandering techno babble. Listeners of Frances the Mute will need to know were the forward track button on their CD players are, as you will often need it to act as an editing tool. I can handle one or even two sonic trips into no were on an album, but five or six is too much for me, especially for a recording with apparently little real music. I agree with many of reviews that when the Mars Volta decide to make music, its all good. Yet this album sounds like the expanded version one might expect a live show or recording to sound like. It also comes off as overdone.    Several good things about Frances are I liked how they added several new instruments into the mix. When I first heard Cedric singing in Spanish I was amazed. I thought his spanish singing is better than his english. I was also pleased to see the Mars Volta exlore their Latin influences much deeper than on De-Loused.     Im not saying Frances is a bad album. But when you put it side to side with De-Loused, you will begin to notice. Adding a few more short tunes to contrast the long ones would have been nice. So they lost a star there. And too much meandering lost them another. But its definatley worth a listen, you be the judge. The Mars Volta would have benefited much from a great producer (like Rick Rubin) on Frances.  Instead they produced this album themselves, so we end up with a recording that possibly suits the Mars Volta more than their fans.
078322799X|5.0|Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) is a hearse-chasing psychic investigator, drawn into the middle of a murderous mystery when people start dropping dead prematurely all around him. Frank is the only one who has any idea what's really going on, due to his ability to see ghosts. He sees a hooded DEATH figure, stalking and crushing the hearts of unsuspecting victims. What connection is there between these new paranormal murders and the death of Bannister's own wife five years earlier? Also, what do the infamous mass-murderer Johnny Bartlett (Jake \\"Starship Troopers\\" Bucey) and his girlfriend Patricia Bradley (Dee \\"The Howling\\" Wallace-Stone) have to do with things? Enter FBI Investigator Dammers (Jeffery \\"Re-Animator\\" Combs) as a man who believes he knows what's happening, but just might be insane! Peter Jackson co-wrote, co-produced, and directed this comic / horror blow-out. The ghosts are cool and the atmosphere is just grim enough to keep the story dark. Danny Elfman's (Batman, Sleepy Hollow, Beetlejuice) score is as good as any he's ever done. THE FRIGHTENERS is a movie that deserves to be seen by any / all creep-fans...
B00003CWL6|4.0|In general, I'm not a fan of movies mocking the American middle class.  Usually they are condescending, politically-motivated hit pieces.  Think: \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" or \\"Pleasantville\\" or the well-known \\"The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.\\"<br /><br />Every now and then, however, along comes a movie that is so well done, so clever, and so well acted and directed that even though you know what it's doing to you, it does it so well that you have to give it its props.  American Beauty is such a movie.  I have watched this movie from start to finish at least 10 times and own the DVD, and I still can't figure out how Sam Mendes and Alan Ball were was able to take the cliches of dead-end jobs, desperate housewives, superficial teenagers, alienated children, closeted military men and pseudo-philosophical drug-dealers and turn them into something entertaining to the point of profound.  It's going to take another 10 viewings to find out.
B00004W510|5.0|Before record executives and labels pushed successful bands to release a dozen singles off each record and wait 5 years between albums, 60's groups were putting out classics at an alarming rate.  The Band must of known their artistic output was reaching a peak and put out two of the most memorable, masterful rock albums of all time between 1968 and 1969.  Though their second album \\"The Band\\" pales slightly in comparison to the debut, these 12 songs are very bit as memorable. <br /> <br />Robbie Robertson famously heard Southerners talking about the way things used to be and was inspired to write a concept album on the subject, i.e. the Old South.  Even the titles suggest that.  But \\"Across the Great divide,\\" \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\\" and \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" are drenched in Southern folk-lore, from the lyrics to the music and everything else about the album (the production, the style, even the cover).  Classic cuts like \\"King Harvest\\" and \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" are just as astonishing today for young listeners (myself being one of them) as they must have been in the late 60's.  Unfortunately, the magic began to dwindle after this album.  But we'll always have this, Big Pink, and the Rock of Ages live album.  That alone makes them remarkable. <br /> <br />Overall:  9 out fo 10.
B0007NFL18|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the year with hits like: Candy Shop, Hate it or Love it and Disco Inferno.  And soon the be hits like: So amazing and Get into my car.  It's just great and he is so FINE.

0792844882|4.0|Yes, for anyone who has seen Showgirls solely for the plot, it is a pretty bad movie.  I give this movie 4 stars for one reason only--it starts with T and ends with A.  T AND A !!  Yes, this flick is all about the T & A from the \\"showgirls\\" parading around, showing all their glory.  If this movie did not have T & A, it would be called \\"GIRLS GONE STUPID.\\"  Hats off to the director for having the cojones to make such a film.  This movie makes Basic Instinct look like Basic Disney.  There's more bouncing, bare breasts in this movie than you can shake a stick  at; plus, some good full-frontal scenes from Liz Berkeley.  I'll bet she never dreamed of doing this when she was making that sitcom \\"Saved By the Bell\\" !!  Anyway, her career may be hanging in the balance because of this film, but we cinema fans will always remember her (and the rest of the movie) for this cheesy little number she did back in the mid-90's. <br />
B0007P3582|4.0|I don't know whats up with all the bad reviews. If u dont like this than what the hell kinda rap have u been listenin to lately. Coming from a hiphop feind, hip hop is in a horrible slum lately... If u're viewing this on 2pac level, no nothing will top 2pac but this has got to be the best album OUT RIGHT NOW! It was not a disappointment at all. The beats have got to be the best i've heard ina long time. everyone seems to be dissing his lyrics... wtf have u been listenin to?! once again no 2pac but still very good. i never liked fat joe or jada so dont think i'm jumpin the 50 bandwagon when i say his lyrics beats them to death. the terror squad album was a complete joke so need i say anymore, and as for jada's \\"why\\" and his poor ass excuse of trying to be profound... trying to sound smart and clever but he says nothing vaid, yet he ends with \\"And you know why they made the new twenties? Cause I got all my old ones\\". Is that the lyrical genious u crave? he should be beaten for that garbage. The only rapper 50 disses that has any talent is nas, eventhough he hasn't really put out anything that good lately. I swear the bad reviews are coming from fat joe and jadakiss groupies. Listen to the album on mtv.com's the leak and judge for yourself.
B000007T2Z|5.0|I recently saw a dance piece that used selections from this album, the New Zero Kanada one, and possible the other ones. I have no words to describe the effect they had on an audience. Turn this music up, bathe it in, and if you have any sort of capacity for abstract thought, it will transform you. It's like a religious experience when you press play, only you don't need to be baptized or straight or whatever... <br /> <br />So buy it now. Or go into you're record store and just listen. Any of the GY!BE records. If there isn't a line up, listen to the whole thing. Or maybe all of them. <br />You'll know what I'm talking about.
B0000027I6|5.0|Ah, what a fantastic album this is.  A wonderful, powerful concept album that is everything I know and love about Pink Floyd albums, without Pink Floyd, of course.  Ex-Pink Floyd singer/songwriter delivers a powerful album that is more like a movie - Raw, emotional, moving.  This is a great continuation of Roger Water's finer masterpieces... Dark Side and The Wall.  A genuine, heartfelt experience and it is, I believe, his best solo work to date.  Roger Waters is an incredibly compassionate human being.  This album is filled with songs that are beautiful, thought provoking, and terrifying - sometimes, all at once.  If you are a fan of Pink Floyd's work and Roger's, I suggest you give \\"In the Flesh\\" a listening... it is a great live album showcasing highlights of both Roger's solo songs and Pink Floyd songs, wonderfully.
B0007O38F8|5.0|First and foremost, I do not give this album 5 stars.  I gave it 5 stars to at least try to compensate for the bogus and utterly unfair ratings this LP has taken.  I can easily give \\"The Massacre\\" 4 stars.   <br /> <br />For all those looking for \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" part 2...This isn't it.  That isn't exactly a bad thing.  Why do we need an exact replica of an already existing album?  This is a very solid C.D.  The first couple songs are not very good, but once you hit song 5, the album heats up.  Gatman and Robin, Candy Shop and Outta Control, come in succession, and are very good tracks.  Scott Storch did a fantastic job with the beats.  Then you get to songs 12,13, and 14, which are Ryder Music, Disco Inferno, and A Lil Bit...Great Tracks once again. <br /> <br />Out of 22 tracks, I'd say you will be in your car or at home, playing 10 to 13 tracks regularly.  That is a good dosage of 50 Cent. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  If you like 50 cent, and anything that he has come out with in the past.  Go by \\"The Massacre\\" give it a few listens, and you won't be disappointed.

B0007P3582|3.0|In many ways it's a shame the releases of \\"The Massacre\\" and \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" weren't reversed.  If \\"The Massacre\\" were being judged on its own merits, and it does have some good beats and tight rhymes, it would be considered a good album.  Not a great album, but a good one.  However, as a follow up to one of the highest selling, most powerful records to come to the American public's attention since the days of \\"All Eyez on Me\\"--\\"The Massacre\\" doesn't live up to its title.  After hearing the entire album several times-- I feel a better title might have been \\"The Papercut\\".
B000002MNL|4.0|Morrissey is loved by many and hated by many.  There is no inbetween.  You identify, appreciate, or you don't.  It is that simple.  The odd thing is, the same thing that makes his fans love him is what makes morrissey haters hate him.  I find that completely incredible and it says a lot about the impact he has on people.  As you can tell by this rating, I am not a hater.  And this is my personal favorite Morrissey album.  Its mature, its melancholic, its solid from start to finish and it is classic Morrissey doing what Morrissey does best - speaking to the misfits and the depressed.  Bravo to this guy, somebody has to stand up for the minority and for that, he is somewhat of a hero in my book.  This cd doesn't break any ground to me, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars... just a darn good laid back mood throughout. <br /> <br />*By the way, Bona Drag is a nice cd to get started on if you are thinking of testing the waters with Morrissey's music for the first time.  It is a great collection of singles/b sides/compilation whatever you want to call it.   <br /> <br />And what a comeback cd! - \\"You are the Quarry\\".  Morrissey still knows how to bring it.  Wish I could have seen his latest concert, heard it was killer.
B000003TAB|5.0|hey people do yourselves a favor and go blow a big one. Nirvana was one of the best bands ever and in my opinion the the best, specially this album,, its so cool specially the songs dive, stain, ben a son, hairspray queen, aero zepplin, and aneurysim. All of you people who keep giving nirvana bad reviews cause you think they are overratted ars stupid and the jokes on you. Grunge was the last good thing that happened in music, music has not been as boring or stupid in a long time with the exception of a handfull of names, marilyn manson, tool, pantera, disturbed, breaking benjamin, and afi are the only bands out today worth listening to.
B00004BZ16|4.0|I have two theories on this, the group's fourth album. The first is that the success of London Calling went to their heads, and so they decided to do something artistic. But I think the more likely theory is that after London Calling, the band finally accepted the fact that punk was dying off (a fact they'd been trying to come to grips with on their third album), and decided that they'd better find another sound that they liked. Rather than explore different genres over a series of albums, like most other groups would, the Clash, being the Clash, went ahead and did it all on three records, then packaged the entire thing as one sprawling mess of an album. It's almost appropriate that Joe Strummer is wearing an army helmet on the cover. If one puts either disc into their discman and then presses PLAY, they will hear that the band does indeed try to take everything on. They don't care if they're any good at that particular genre, they will play it with all the inimitable cynicism that makes them one of the best bands of the last 30 years.    That being said, since the Clash try to tackle everything all at once, not every song on this album works. But what does work works extremely well. For example, the band doesn't just write a disco song. They'll explore it from just about every conceivable angle, but not all at once. They'll try it one way, then try something else for a few songs, then come back to disco (but this time they might try combining it with something else just to see how it sounds). They do this with every genre they delve into. Ultimately, it's up to the listener to decide what's hot, and what's not.     Of the two discs, I would have to say Disc One is the most solid. I didn't like \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" the first time I heard it, but the second time, when I listened to the lyrics, I realized the Clash was maintaining their cynical sense of humor, spinning the working-man's tale over a garish, yet addictive disco-funk beat (\\"What do we have for entertainment? Cops kicking gypsies on the pavement.\\"). So in the end, \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" deserves to be called an essential Clash song. Sadly, I can't really say the same for \\"Hitsville UK,\\" which many other fans of the group consider to be a classic song. Maybe it's the fact that Mick Jones's girlfriend is singing backing vocals. I always felt that Jones never needed help singing, unless it came from Joe Strummer (the contrasts in their voices make for some amazing harmony). But anyway, I always skip this song. A few other songs of note on the first disc are:    -\\"Ivan Meets GI Joe.\\" I don't know why I like this song. I shouldn't like it as much as I do, but for some reason, it's one of my favorite songs on the album. I would say that again, the lyrics win me over. It's as if the band somehow takes the razzle-dazzle of a Roller Rink or Discotheque, and applies it to the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers of the time (\\"He tried his tricks, that Ruskie bear. United Nations said it's all fair\\").    -\\"Something About England.\\" I especially like the role-playing between Joe Strummer and Mick Jones on this one. I think the band, like a few other English musicians, saw the socio-economic troubles their country was entering at the start of the 1980s. Of course, what makes this song great is that Strummer's \\"old man\\" character is suggesting that such things are timeless.    -\\"Look Here.\\" This one is just catchy. It's like 1940s swing jazz with the unique spin of the Clash. For some reason, I keep thinking it could be a London Calling outtake.      -\\"Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice).\\" One of the many hybrid songs on the album. Paul Simonon's bass sounds distinctly funk, Topper Headon's drums sound distinctly hard rock, while Strummer growls with all the ferocity one might find in an early Clash song. This is perhaps one of the finest offerings on the album. Why it didn't make it onto The Essential Clash, I have no idea.     -\\"The Sound of Sinners.\\" The fact that the Clash are tackling gospel automatically makes this song ironic. And the icing on the cake is how blatant the lyrics are in their preaching of Old Testament wrath (\\"As the floods of God wash away Sin City, they say it was written in the page of the Lord. But I was looking for that great jazz note that destroyed the walls of Jericho\\"). Now imagine the preceding line being sung with Strummer's signature lispy growl.    Digressing for a moment, one of the most prolific sounds on here is reggae, which is experimented with in many forms. We have the wonderfully disjointed psychedelic bluegrass/reggae amalgam of \\"Junco Partner,\\" the hip-hop reggae of \\"One More Time\\" (which, coupled with the following track, \\"One More Dub,\\" just might be an early ancestor of modern hip-hop), and the blatant carnivale calypso of \\"Let's Go Crazy.\\" One gets a sense that even as far back as 1980, Joe Strummer discovered a sound that he seemed to enjoy, and would serve as a main influence when he started writing music again in 1999. Anyway, moving along to Disc Two:    This one starts out nice. The first five tracks are outstanding. We have the retro punk-rocker \\"Police On My Back,\\" followed by the soft, yet sharp country-rock of \\"Midnight Log.\\" Then things get a bit more experimental with \\"The Equaliser.\\" This was another song I didn't like when I first heard it, but by the third time, I realized that the group was blending a reggae bass-line with what ultimately sounds like disco played at a lower RPM. This only serves as a prelude to some of the more bizarre experimentation on the second half of the disc. \\"The Call Up\\" is a great R and B number with snatches of punk influence, but the real standout track of the second disc is \\"Washington Bullets.\\" The politics contained in the lyrics are a bit dated by the standards of today, but the simplicity of Strummer's rhyming, combined with the xylophone track being laid down by Headon, give the song the feel of a children's nursery rhyme (\\"Andin the Bay of Pigs in 1961, Havana fought a playboy in the Cuban sun. For Castro is a color is redder-than-red. Those Washington Bullets want Castro dead. Castro is a color that will earn you a spray of lead.\\") But once again, this just adds to the song's irony. Sadly, after track five, the second disc begins to fall apart. A few more highlights are \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\" (with its low-key Middle-Eastern influences), \\"Kingston Advice,\\" and \\"Version City.\\" But most of the rest of the disc consists of sampling earlier songs on the album, while adding layers of weird effects that ultimately don't serve any unique purpose. Or the band just does things that seem cheap and garish (such as having a child sing a cover of \\"Career Opportunities\\"). But as I said earlier, on an album of this scale, one can't expect everything to work.     So, in the end, and as the song says, \\"What have we got?\\" Well, according to a website I visited, the Clash were a band whose primary interest was sharing ideas with people. This album definitely contains an overwhelming amount of ideas, both lyrically and musically. I have yet to meet someone who likes every track, since there are thirty-six. But ultimately, if you find what works for you, then Sandinista! is a great album. It may not seem like it the first time you listen, but by the third time, hopefully you will realize that the Clash knew what they were doing, and after all is said and done, we are left with a work that might not be as legendary as London Calling, but still has a significant place in the Clash's catalog.
B0007GAEGC|1.0|I agree with the last reviewer.  This is tripe.  Sickly sweet voices and over produced, with every bit of character ironed out of these songs.  This rendition of Siuil a run is pretty sounding, but you don't get any feel for the loss or sorrow expressed in such a set of words...it just sounds like a \\"muzak\\" version to me. <br /> <br />Pity...some of the women DO have good voices...but they are just so \\"soulless\\".
B000002H70|5.0|Very few cd's offer such a compelling list of solid songs in a focused theme and actually succeed in doing exactly what was intended.  You cannot help but \\"disentegrate\\" with Robert as his music and lyrics bring you down, hypnotise and captivate.  There are very few experiences more satisfying than sad songs that make you feel good and this disc delivers.  It is also rare for a cd's singles to be outshined by the other album tracks.  I feel it safe to say that \\"Lovesong,\\" \\"Lullaby,\\" and \\"Fascination Street\\" - although great songs, do not have the staying power that the other tracks have.  This cd is epic and surrounds you in a joyful, introspective misery that is close to perfect in its entirety.  However, if you are not a cure fan I do not believe this album will impress you.
B000024D4R|5.0|Well i would have to say that in my opinion this is the best pink floyd album of all time, even though it only has 5 songs there is enough material on here to make it a full album cause of the lenght of some of the songs. I think pigs three different ones is the best track,, from the keyboard intro to the cool bass riffings and the ultimate guitar solos that gilmore does. i would recomend this album to anyone who is starting out or just doesnt have this album... Its a classic.
0385510454|2.0|An interesting concept: part travelogue part mystery/thriller/suspense with a little DC flavor thrown in for extra flavor. And like many great recipes, just because you have great ingridients does not mean what you make is good. To be fair, the book is interesting lite reading. Very lite. The story of the power broker super lobbyist going too far, ending up in jail forever, only to be released by the mechanations of the CIA, to fufill the CIA's desire to learn the secret behind a computer program/satellite system mystery, was entertaining....the Italian tangent was only mildly so.  <br /> <br />Grisham could have written a great story Set in Washington, DC about the Broker (and perhaps he will do pregueal!)full of sex, double-dealing, political intrigue and all manner of good stuff. Instead, we get an ocassional flashback about the Broker that merely whets the appetite. What we get alot of is nice descriptions of various Cities in Italy. It makes one wonder if Grisham deduted his vacation to Italy on his taxes?
B0002X314C|4.0|From the moment you hear his voice, you are hooked.  Amazing songs, beautifully delivered.  Brutally honest but not cynical.  Passionate  and sexy but not nasty.  There's humor, love, lust, a story in each song.  The music smooth and soulful.  Great jams.  Looking forward to some warmer weather so I can feel the sun on my face while listening LOUDLY!
B0007O38F8|3.0|Well I was looking forward on this album ever since he dropped his last one G.R.O.D.T. That album was bomb!!!!!!!In The Dvd \\"Beef\\" 50 disses Ja. Saying Ja. Is A pop Artist That Ja.

0676973779|5.0|This is a story about a young teenager, Pi, whose family is moving across the Pacific to Canada with a whole zoo. The teenager, to be on the safe side, considers himself to be a Christian, a Muslim, and a Hindu all at once, and will soon need all the religious support he can get. The ship sinks in mid ocean, and he is left in a lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, and a very large and dangerous Bengal tiger, called Richard Parker. His problem now is how to survive, and this problem gets even worse when one by one, Richard devours his animal companions.  The story is very engaging, and the author seems to be showing that religion is no good at all in situation's like Pi's, and that the only thing that really matters is having the skills needed to survive. I enjoyed this story, except maybe for the part where Pi and Richard land on a floating acidic island that is actually carnivorous; that was not really credible for me. But the ending, where we find out about an alternative story of what happened, is very clever.
B00007BHOE|5.0|Lovem 'em or hate 'em, you've got to admit that Slipknot can put on a really good show.  Their live set on this Disasterpieces DVD proves this, but more importantly, this is how bands should do concert/music DVD's.  The first disc of this two disc set features Slipknot performing in London during their Pledge of Allegiance tour, and the fan favorite songs you'd expect to hear are here, including \\"People = S***\\", \\"Eyeless\\", \\"My Plague\\", \\"Heretic Anthem\\", \\"Spit it Out\\", \\"Wait and Bleed\\", and \\"Surfacing\\" among others, plus an off the wall drum solo from Joey Jordinson, who is undoubtadly one of the best drummers in metal today.  The sound quality is amazing, and you get to see the kind of chaos which breaks out at a Slipknot show.  Disc 2 features videos for \\"My Plague\\", \\"Left Behind\\", \\"Spit it Out\\", \\"Wait and Bleed\\", and the rarely seen animated version of \\"Wait and Bleed\\", along with the audio only \\"Purity\\" which was available on the Digipak version of Slipknot's self titled debut.  All in all, this is one concert/music DVD which is definitely worth the price, and for Slipknot fans, this is most definitely a must own.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Love,love LOVE this c.d. Especially the first disc. I didn't realize just how many hit songs he had and that was just the ballads. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for  Mr. Michael and now I feel like I have discovered his music all over again. This is defenitely worth purchasing if you are a die-hard fan or are new to his music. Well done, George. Well done.
B00004VVNB|1.0|I thought I was going to watch one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.NOT.The acting was boring and so was the story in which I had a hard time understanding.If this movie is a classic,it should be considered one of the most boring of all-time.Now I see why I didn't watch the so-called TV series.
B00000I8BX|5.0|For starters, if you already own the original Obsolete (the one without Where Evil Dwells, Soulwound, Messiah, and Concreto), then I would not advise you to trash your old copy for this one. It's not that the bonus tracks are bad. Soulwound and Messiah are loud, high octane tracks that any FF listener can headbang to anytime, anywhere. However, the vocals in Where Evil Dwells(the verses, at least) and Concreto take a lot of getting used to. At first listen, even a hardcore FF listener like me might get kind of annoyed by them, especially in Concreto. It took me a while to get beyond the vocals in that song. The four songs altogether (W.E.D. and Concreto included) are quite good after hearing them a couple times, but they simply just aren't the best bonus tracks FF has to offer. So, if you don't have Obsolete yet, then you might as well just buy this one and bask in the bonus glory. However, if you already own Obsolete, find some way to download the tracks (or perhaps just buy it off this site; it's only five bucks), cuz they don't, in any way, make the original deserve the garage sale.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|As a former \\"Greek geek\\" follower of ancient mythology, I was anxious to see this film and ready to pick it apart for inaccuracies. In fact, I did spend the first half of the movie doing this (Where are the gods and goddesses, who were so prominent in the Iliad? Where was Cassandra, one of literature's most fascinating and tragic heroines?) But after awhile, I sat back and accepted some one else's interpretation of the legend. If you do the same, you may enjoy this movie, too. Troy was a pleasant surprise and much better than I expected. Here's my review on the main characters and the actors who portrayed them:    ACHILLES: Brad Pitt was really fun to watch as Achilles, not only because of his famously sculpted bod but because he really put more depth into a character who seemed more like a fighting machine in the Iliad. I also liked how the screenwriter made Achilles a mortal (unlike the legend, where he's 95% immortal) so that his actions seemed even more brash and arrogant. The only problem is that movie viewers like to see their heroes go through personal growth, and Achilles doesn't achieve much of this (the writer's fault?) Other than the highly contrived love-interest in Briseis, Achilles doesn't seem very human at all. Highlight: Achilles' first fight, which lasts all of 10 seconds, and his arrogant exclamation: \\"Is there no one else?!\\" Final grade: C for character writing, B for acting.    HECTOR: Wow! Eric Bana had far and away the best performance in this film as Hector. Bana gave Hector even more depth and pathos than the character had in the Iliad. Hector is a hero for the ages, a leader whom everyone even today could admire: courageous and strategic, yet compassionate and respectful. Hector actually earns the respect of the audience as the story advances. Highlights: The anguish on his face after he finds out that he killed Patroklus, a boy-warrior too young for battle; the touching moments when he says farewell to everyone he loves to face his inevitable death-fight with Achilles. Final grade: A for character writing, A+ for acting.    PARIS: People have complained about Orlando Bloom's Paris as being too much of a wimp. But the fact is, Paris WAS a wimp, and Bloom portrayed him very accurately. My only gripe is the insipid dialogue that he has to carry (\\"But I LOVE her!\\") and his lack of chemistry with Helen. Highlight: After he's wounded by Menelaus, the terror and humiliation he shows as he scampers back to hang onto Hector's leg for protection. Final grade: B for character writing, B for acting.    HELEN: Poor casting. Diane Krueger was pretty enough (no matter who was chosen to be Helen, people would still complain about the lack of beauty), but her inexperience as an actress produced a cardboard character. It would have been better to cast a box-office draw (but then, I suppose Nicole and Julia wouldn't be relegated to secondary role). Highlights: None! Final grade: C for character writing, F for acting.    AGAMEMNON: Brian Cox was marvelous, if a little hammy, in the role of the film's chief villain. Even though he over-acted the role, he was always fun to watch. His dose of humor was welcome in an otherwise brutal and tragic story. Highlight: When Paris and Hector approach Agamemnon and Menelaus for a fight, Agamemnon says wryly, \\"I see you're not hiding behind your high walls. Valiant of you. Ill-advised, but valiant.\\" Final grade: B for character writing, A- for acting.    It's been said that the Iliad (and Aeneid) is utterly unfilmable in today's times, but I believe Wolfgang Peterson did a good job of making this legend appealing for a contemporary audience. The fact is, adding the gods of Mount Olympus would have been silly (imagine a campy 1950's version of this movie!), and it makes the story even more dramatic that the main heroes - namely Achilles and Hector - realize that the gods won't help them and that they are left to their own devices.
B000000H4V|5.0|This is Sepultura's best album. They start to go beyond the realm of cookie cutter death metal bands and breed a new style of music that influenced great artists like Skinlab and Pissing Razors. \\"Territory\\" is the best track on this album. \\"Refuse/Resist\\" is also a classic, along with \\"Slave New World\\" and the other tracks. You need to buy this album NOW! This is an essential for any breed of metalhead.
B00005JMAH|5.0|The first movies were directed by a person and were a bit wooden in their presentation.  Prisoner of Azkaban breaks out of the stiff actor mold and rigid camera settings.  The settings are more interesting and the character are truly dynamic. <br /> <br />Michael Gamdon is admirable in his role as Dumbledore.  The late Richard Harris, who played the character in past films, seemed to fit the role better, however, Gamdon's portrayal of Hogwart's headmaster is delightful. <br /> <br />Gary Oldman, always a joy to watch in any role, is perfectly suited to the part of the darkly mysterious Sirius Black.  His character contrasts nicely with those of the brooding Professor Snape, brilliantly played by Alan Rickman, and the tormented Professor Lupin, brought to life by David Thewlis.  These three consummate actors are well-suited for the roles of childhood friends and rivals.  The depth they add to the characters brings the pages of the book to life on the screen. <br /> <br />Fans of the books will find this film much more dynamic and true to the spirit of the book.  Lines and scenes are not repeated strictly verbetim from the pages of the book and the characters aren't as mechanical in their actions.  Those who have not read the books may be left wondering about a few unanswered questions, but overall Prisoner of Azkaban is a delight for any family movie night.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Wow. From the first line of this \\"comedy,\\" I knew it was going to be bad. I had heard some great things, so naturally I had to see it. What a disappointment. I found my self smiling twice, and laughing only once, and that was a completely banal scene where Napoleon's attempt at a bike jump results in the ramp crumbling uder him and him crashing. Point is, it had nothing to do with the story, and could have been in any film. <br /> <br />The only saving grace, and in my opinion the only scene worth watching, was the climax, which sees Napoleon defying his nerdiness to put on a great dance routine.  <br /> <br />I didn't expect much going in; after all, it's an MTV movie. But I have to say: given the choice, I'd watch Beavis and Butthead 10 times out of 10 before Napoleon.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The first two installments in the Matrix trilogy are superb, however, Revolutions is rather anticlimatic when compared to the others.  As a whole, Revolutions manages to complete the cycle begun in the first film and answers all the questions left unanswered from the second while creating a few of its own.     There are several things wrong with this film:    1. The special effects are spectacular, as always, but after seeing the same slow-motion-stop-and-spin-the-camera trick a dozen times within the first hour or so, the viewer is ready for the story to progress with less eye candy.    2. The dialogue gets bogged down with overly analytical pseudo-philosophical babbling to the point that it feels like your brain is going to explode.    3. The battle for Zion is one of the most visually stunning action series I have seen to date, however, the \\"specialness\\" of the special effects once again hinders the flow of the story rather than adds to it.  When the viewer notices the special effects more than the progression of the story, it should be taken as a hint to the producers/directors that too much of a good thing is just that -- too much.    4. The characters, all of whom were dynamic in the first two films, have become somewhat wooden and stiff in their interactions with one another.    5. The final battle between Neo and a hundreds of Agents Smith is, again, visually stunning, but it reminded me too much of foreign martial arts flicks from the late 70s and early 80s in its choreography.  Even with the flexible laws of physics within the Matrix, combatants should only be able to hang in the air for a few seconds while punching each others' lights out as opposed to the endless minutes found here.    6. The ending is anticlimatic after the tremendous build up from the other two films and the viewer is still left with a few unanswered questions.  (My husband equated it with finishing a hot fudge sundae only to discover the whipped cream was actually Cool Whip and someone left off the cherry -- good but still disappointing.)    Revolutions is good as a sci-fi film, but it would have been much better with more vocal explanantion spoke in plain English instead of pseudo-philosophical babbling and much less \\"notice-the-great-camera-trick-that-we've-thought-up-on-the-spur-of-the-moment\\"-style special effects which grow tedious after the first thirty mintues.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I've been a fan of the Donnie Darko film for a while now, but was wary of spending the money on a \\"Director's Cut\\" version of the movie. Many other films have had extended director's cut versions released where there were only a few seconds or a couple minutes of extra footage, which added nothing to the story. That is simply not the case with this particular DVD. In this instance, the director's cut answers many questions that a viewer of the theatrical release may have asked while watching the film. There are a ton of extra scenes, and they're not just \\"fluff\\" shots, but actually contribute a lot to the story. If you saw the original version and liked it, but didn't quite understand what was going on all the time, watch the director's cut, and it's very likely that you'll \\"get it\\" this time 'round.
B00009QG73|5.0|Thanks to Scott Briggs for writing in and addressing the problem I experienced with the audio on this DVD fading in and out.  He was correct that my receiver set up needed to be changed. Now that the problem has been resolved I have re-written my review and given this spectacular DVD the five star rating it deserves. I am a life long Roxy Music fan and I was lucky enough to catch this tour in Philadelphia so it has special meaning for me. On this tour Roxy went back to their roots, revisiting songs like \\"Virginia Plain\\" and \\"Re-Make Remodel\\" with a blistering energy that surprised me when I heard it. As always Brian Ferry plays the quintessential wounded romantic, wooing us with his sultry baritone and seducing us with his quirky, country gentleman appeal. Guitarists Phil Manzanera and Chris Spedding are both brilliant. Their blistering back-to-back solos on \\"My Only Love\\" provide one of the highlights of the show.  Andy MacKay's haunting horn gives Roxy it's ambient signature sound and drummer Paul Thompson is a monster! All of the musicians on stage do a fantastic job. Lucy Wilkins is able to cover both Brian Eno's screeching synthesizer and Eddie Jobson's searing violin, filling in for two very important original members simultaneously. This DVD captures a very special moment in time that should not be missed.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Green Day's American Idiot would be a lot easier to listen to if I didn't fall asleep in the middle of it all the time. <br />This is THE worst album in my collection simply because it's boring and there's only 4 good songs on it, the rest is EXTREMELY boring. <br />Don't buy this cd, but be sure to ask for a copy from your Green Day fanatic wannabe friends so that you know what you're missing.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Ever After is a poignant, inspiring film based on Cinderella. But it's not the story most of us know of, it's more heartfelt and has much more substance than any fairytale I've ever read. Drew Barrymore's character Danielle is great, and Dougray Scott is a very convincing prince out to win her heart. Also one of the movies that has been given 2 Thumbs Up by Siskel and Ebert, which was rare then, because they were so critical of movies such as this.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This man has so much class and style. I just love his voice. I love it so much that I actually bought a voice lesson CD on Amazon, \\"Voice Lessons To Go\\" by Vaccarino, so that I could train my own sound to sing along with him ( I think it's working!). Am I crazy? If only he would ask me to sing back-ups on his concert tours! <br />By the way I love to play this music while I am cooking a big meal it is so relaxing!
6305313687|5.0|Surely, this is not a movie you would let your children see, nor is it a movie you should see with your parents, but it is a heartfelt movie that is very moving, despite the matter of nazism. Edward Norton's character evolves so much through this movie, it's amazing.  First, he's the notorious headleader of a nazi gang, and at the end, he's become a genuine spokesman for peace. One of the greatest transformations I've seen from an actor/ or character to date.
B000000OMP|3.0|The 1984 Whitesnake \\"Slide it In\\" band was actually in transition to what was to become the biggest selling Whitesnake band in the early 1990s (with new guitarists and others) \\"Slide It In\\" however is respectable with newcomer John Sykes (Thin Lizzy) laying down remarkable guitar along with veteran blues slinger Mel Galley, and Jon Lord, Neil Murray, and Cozy \\"I'm dead now\\" Powell. Coverdale's songs are good, too, most being written with longtime partner Galley, and one with venerable ex-whitesnake guitarist Mickey Moody. Hooks are everywhere and Coverdale just seems to along for the ride as this is a top-notch act delivering a formidable sound. Of course, it all sounds a bit dated now, but such as life. If you don't know it, get it. Production is very good and stills cranks loud very well.
B00005V9IL|3.0|Though I'm usually a big fan of sci-fi films, there was something about this one that I thought was missing.  Don't get me wrong, Ed Harris is a great actor, I'm just not sure that the whole cast was right for the roles they played. Sometimes casting can make or break a movie. Just take Haunted Mansion for example, those kids were awful actors!
B0006UYOJM|5.0|If you like this album, you'll love this 24 karat audiophile gold disc. My original LP pales in comparison to this disc! You can crank up your stereo and enjoy the perfectly balanced EQ on this release. Kenny Jones' drums pack a punch, Ron Woods' bluesy guitar riffs come across in fine detail, and the low end of Ronnie Lane's bass playing stands out (I'd never noticed what great playing he did on this album). Of course, Ian McLagen's electric piano and organ fills in the spaces nicely. And it goes without saying that Rod Stewart is one of the best rock vocalists EVER (What happened, Rod??). The Faces never sounded so good. Even if you own the \\"Five Guys Walk Into A Bar\\" box set, you should buy the Audio Fidelity gold disc. You will NOT regret it... trust me.
B0006SSOHM|4.0|I must say this movie totally caught me by surprise. I almost refused to watch it thinking it was just another gorey, plotless, no-story, let's try to scare some people, worthless movie. But then I watched it. I was shocked. I will say that this movie was brilliant. Aside from subpar acting performances, this movie was excellent.     Now, this and SE7EN are very different movies but I will say that Saw was very comparible to that film. It's a look inside the mind of a psychopathic killer who believes they've got it all figured out and is trying to prove a point through these \\"situations\\" he is putting people in, who, in turn are to attempt the save their own lives by doing something quite desperate and abnormal. I grow tired of movies that serve no purpose but to try to scare, ex. The Ring, The Grudge, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. They make little sense, loose ends are rarely tied together, the plot is generally insignificant. But this was different. The story really keeps you thinking, and you stay on the edge throughout the movie.     What I really liked about this movie was something the director accomplished that most try to do but few can succeed. He makes you believe that you've got it all figured out (on a few occasions), and everything is coming together just like you predicted, and BAM, the ending throws it all right back in your face. All I could do at the end of this movie was smile and say \\"Bravo\\" and give it a good clap. It was brilliant.     I do have a few qualms though bringing it down to a 4 star. They are: acting...questionable. I guess that is because I'm not sure I've seen Kary Elwes in a serious role like this one, I mean, look at his resume: Robin Hood Men in Tights, Hot Shots, The Princess Bride (excellent movie), etc. It was kind of like placing Leslie Nielson in...I don't know...The Patriot as General Cornwallace? You get the picture. There was something else I thought was strange but effective. There is a car chase scene where the camera jumpsaround and is sped up and the drivers are both kinda crazy...it all came off kinda goofy to me, not too big a deal though.    In all, if you think this is another \\"scare\\" movie, it's not. The previews did a poor job I must say. Give it a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Very well done, minus the casting.
B0007NFL18|4.0|Since his first album sold 11 million I didn't expect this could top it and I guess everything has lived up to my expectations.  The album is fairly solid.  Its got some really strong songs namely, In My Hood, the much hyped Piggy Bank, and Gunz Come Out.  If you've been listening to the Game/G-Unit/Lloyd Banks/Young Buck this album fits right in.  50 hast his own style but this is really similar to what the whole group has been doing. <br /> <br />You probably won't be blown away by this CD but you won't be dissapointed.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Yet again, another fabulous album is released by Opeth.  It is astonishing how great this band is.  Great album, after great album, after great album.   <br />This album is definitely one of Opeth's heavier albums with Mikael Akerfeldt's growls being more ferocious and brutal as ever.  It is primarily made up of wicked, heavy guitar riffs/pounding double bass drums and the occasional soft passages with mellow acoustic guitars, and angelic vocals.  The lyrics on this album are a bit different from other works from Opeth in that they are pretty grim (I am pretty sure someone close to Mikael Akerfeldt died when he wrote both Deliverance and Damnation.  It says something like that in both the booklets from both Deliverance and Damnation). <br /> <br />Every single song on this album (with the exception of \\"For Absent Friends\\") is over 10 minutes in length, and not one song ever gets boring.  Each and every song is also highly technical, done brilliantly, and melodic as hell from \\"Wreath,\\" straight down to \\"By the Pain I See in Others.\\"   <br /> <br />1) \\"Wreath\\"- 9/10- Heavy/Blistering from the start, heavy/blistering until the finish with a short soft passage in the latter part of the song. <br /> <br />2) \\"Deliverance\\"- 10/10- Classic Opeth.  Opens furiously, then calms down a bit for a while, then furious again. <br /> <br />3) \\"A Fair Judgement\\"- 10/10- The softest song on the album.  It is similar to songs on Damnation, only longer.  No death metal growls, just elegant vocals, beautiful keyboards, and great melody. <br /> <br />4) \\"For Absent Friends\\"- 8/10- Great instrumental piece but very short. <br /> <br />5) \\"Master's Apprentices\\"- 1,000/10- This is the best song on the album in my opinion.  Opens with an insanely heavy guitar riff and straight up demonic vocals.  Then later on in the song, one of the most gorgeous soft acoustic passages I have ever heard from ANY band, let alone Opeth.  Then just as your eyes are closing taking in the beauty of the acousticpassage, out of nowhere Mikael hits you with beastly vocals and brutal guitar riffs again. <br /> <br />6) \\"By the Pain I see in Others\\"- 9/10- Great and may I add weird (but in a great way) song.  The lyrics are strange, and the whole composition of the song is awesomely strange as well.   <br /> <br />In all though, Opeth is just a spectacular band and this album is too good.   <br />
B00004THAY|5.0|This disc is stellar and a must have for anyone with even an inkling of appreciation for the blues or either of the featured artists.  <br />King and Clapton's battling axes here are nothing short of stunningly brilliant - this one is a keeper.  There isn't one cut on this ablum that is mediocre, and most are simply fantastic - how many discs can claim that these days?  If for nothing else, buy it for the cover alone.
0582403855|3.0|Harmer was one of the two recommended texts for my CELTA English as a Second Language course. I found it heavy going, long on theory, short on practical advice for the new ESL teacher. I much prefer Scrivener, \\"Learning Teaching.\\" It's hard to find in the US, but worth the effort.
B0007NFL1S|1.0|I am a die hard real hip hop fan and this CD is GARBAGE. It does not deserve the one star I gave him. Don't buy his album. If you really want it, BURN IT. The cd is about him being angry at everyone. Would we even know who 50cent is if he didn't have beef with every one in the Rap game. And how dare he attack NAS. 50cent can't even pronounciate his words let alone compose them lyricaly like NAS. The album has some good beats but thats it. The lyrical content is weak. Please don't support this album. And to make matters worst 50cent said in an interview that he does not even spend time with his son because he is so busy. He said that he just gives him money and thats the extent of his fatherly duties. So not only does he suck as an artist, he sucks as a black man and a human. F**k 50. Put down the mic and go take care of your kids!! GO GET THE GAME!!! WAY BETTER CD
B00005JLFC|5.0|Now that some time has passed since Yentl's release in 1983, hopefully people can forget about all the ink spilled vilifing Ms Streisand for daring to take control of every aspect of the film and see it with fresh eyes.  As a film, it stands the test of time. Bathed in Rembrant earth tones, it's not only beautiful to look at, but the plot is exciting, the characters are complex and the themes running through it are ageless. Mandy Patinkin and Amy Irving have never been better.  As for Ms Streisand, neither before nor since Yentl, has her multi-faceted talent been given such a canvas and the result is a deeply-felt, richly textured artistic accomplishment.  Upon the film's release, her directing and singing received most of the media attention (understandably) but I think her performance was overlooked.  Her sensitive portrait of a young woman, alone in the world, desperate to study while coping with first love, ranks alongside Katie from The Way We Were as her most mature, fully-realized characterization.  People who criticize the film for not being a strict adaptation of the Singer short story, don't understand Streisand's philosophy about art.  In interviews, she has said that she sees art as a living, breathing, organism (she, afterall, called Stephen Sondheim, asking him to rework his classic Send in the Clowns for her Broadway album). I suspect that the DVD hasn't been released yet because Ms Streisand is tinkering away in her Bel Air mansion on the organism that is the film, finding new insights to include in the product.  Be patient.  It will be worth the wait.
B000002OX7|5.0|This album is great, there are many songs on this album that are <br />great. This album is nearly a classic album, with hits such as <br />Baba O' Riley, Bargain, Love aint for Keeping, Behind Blue Eyes, <br />& Won't Get Fooled Again. There are many good songs on this album <br />and if you are new to the Who, you may want this. <br />This album is a must have for any cd collection for any rock fan.
B0007O38F8|1.0|yes the cd is a massacre because it was just terrible, the hooks the lyrics he so called beef track which was just another gimmick hook track....awful, i didnt buy it but i did hear it before it came out, so dont think i am just hating...the track that is actually good is ryder music, the beat is nice , which couldve been without 50 on it....but overall, i am not feelin game but his cd was better than 50's which is what i believe is another reason why they have....garbage....and to DALTON HIGGINS, keep kissin G-unit a**....we see who you are riding with...if ya'll want real hip hop, go pick up a CORMEGA CD...
B00005QK3W|3.0|I'm one of McCartney's hugest fans, but the little \\"Go in and do the album in the shortest time possible like we used to do in The Beatles\\" philosophy quit working at about the time that band broke up. Each time that you've gone in and tried to do something quickly, it's been sub par, \\"Run Devil Run\\" being a noteable exception. Please slow down, take your time (especially with the lyrics) and do a great album. <br /> <br />Driving Rain is just not a great album. I'm writing this 4 years after its release and 4 years after I got it.  <br /> <br />The positives of this album: <br /> <br />\\"ABOUT YOU\\"- I really, really like this song. Bluesy rocker with decent lyrics. WHY didn't Capitol release this as a single instead of that GOD AWFUL \\"From a Lover to a Friend\\"?? FALTAF removed ANY chance of this album selling at all to anyone that heard it on the radio. <br /> <br />\\"YOUR LOVING FLAME\\"- Nice song. Pretty decent lyrics. Good production. Nice backup vox- reminiscent of Linda/Denny Laine. Again, a decent choice for a single. \\"Chase my Blues Away\\" isn't a great lyric, but it works. <br /> <br />\\"HEATHER\\"- Decent (almost) instrumental. Could've been an awesome song with a bit more production and some actual lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"FREEDOM\\"- I don't mind this song. The lyrics make a lot more sense to me than those of \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" (Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism????) and it was a quick response to a nation-shaking event, so it's ok. Plus it's mostly live. <br /> <br />Ok, now the bad-  <br /> <br />The other songs come off as way unfinished demos. <br />Some of the lyrics are embarrassingly bad. I'd rather hear \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" from the White Album than \\"Tiny Bubble\\" or \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" or \\"From a Lover to a Friend\\". Wild Honey Pie is actually a cool little track. These others just sound unfinished. The \\"Ooooooh\\" that Paul's doing in \\"Spinning on an Axis\\" drive me nuts. It's embarrassingly bad. Not out of key. Not out of tune, just filler because there's no lyric there. Ugh. I can't hear it. <br />1-2-3-4-5... we've heard enough about this. It's just bad. It works in All Together Now, doesn't work here. <br /> <br />I went and saw the accompanying tour for this album. GREAT show, but the DR songs were a definite low point of the show. <br /> <br />I find that when I play this on my stero, I'm programming the good tracks and leaving the bad out of the mix. The one time I played it through, my family was like \\"What the heck is that??\\" <br /> <br />Give us another Flaming Pie or Tug of War. This one's just not that great. Those first tracks listed are cool. The rest goes under the \\"Pizza and Fairy Tales\\" bootleg bin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0060763280|5.0|This book has been an excellent review for me. I have attended many of Harv Eker's seminars, and while I've spent a fair bit of cash on these my pockets have become fuller! I've come out way ahead: 1) at the bank; 2) in my personal life.  <br /> <br />If you don't experience any emotional or spiritual transformations from putting the holistic teachings in this book into practice, then I suggest: a) re-reading the book and actually doing the exercises this time; b) taking advantage of the free seminar offered near the back of the book (I found it more than worth the travel and accomodation costs involved. Plus, at that time I paid for the seminar!) <br /> <br />Harv may be hard-hitting, but he has plenty of heart; you'll experience it at his seminars. They're extremely educational and they're really fun! Sounds weird, but I've never experienced so much caring as when I've attended these seminars. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll come away changed. If change is what you're looking for, start by reading this book.
B00079HZUM|5.0|One wonders why Billy Crudup hasn't been offered some of the plum roles say, Colin Farrell, Brad Pitt, or even Orlando Bloom have had.  He is a MUCH stronger actor and every bit as attractive.  What an incredibly brave role this was and strange also. <br />Claire Danes was wonderful also.  The chemistry between them was wonderful and a little sad too, that's the storyline.  High recommend!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I am a big fan of Cedric Bixler Zavala and Omar a Roriguez-Lopez.  I think they are both brilliant in what they do.  The whole point of their music is expression and emotion through music.  I'm happy that they try new things on every album because i hate musicians who try to copy their sound over and over again.   <br /> <br />The Mars Volta is evolving into a powerhouse almost equal to ATDI.  I love it.  The jazz/funk/punk/rock/latin vibe that it pulls off.  You can tell that they put all their effort into this album and that they were not just trying to put out another record(sparta).  Even if you do not like this type of music or it went into a direction that you disagree with, you have to have respect for this band and this album.  I mean come on, ATDI!  And who said that a song had to be 5 mins or less.  Open your mind, their is no restrictions when it comes to music unless your a nazi.
B00005HYHC|5.0|Like most Pink Floyd albums \\"The Wall\\" demands patience and concentration from the listener to give it's full effect. This album is very much a Roger Waters work from start to finish and rightly so because in my opinion it's his, and Pink Floyds best work ever! If you have never listened to any Floyd before and simply jump in on any given track you might wonder what all the fuss is about! Like previous Floyd work The Wall uses sound effects such as planes, voices, babies and bombs as backing. This is not an album you can put on as some light backing music but one you have to listen to and if you do you will hopefully see why this is one of the best selling records of all time.  <br />At the end of the day it's all down to the material. The wall not only features some of the best lyrics ever written but also the best music, all put together with the effects mentioned before to tell the story of Pink from losing his father (killed in action in World War 11)to being drugged as a rock star to ensure the Show Must Go On (Waters on the Animal Tour) The title refers to the barriers we all put up to protect ourselfs from others and the descent into madness if taken too far. For a perfect visual of all this watch The Wall DVD !! <br /> <br />Sometimes you can't explain why certain music is good. This album however benefits from Dave Gilmore the guitarist being the perfect foil for Waters mad rantings. The sheer feel and emotion in his playing gives the songs even more impact and prove that sometimes 1 + 1 = 10 ! All I can say is that in 30 years of listening to some great music from the likes of the Beatles, The Stones, Van Halen, The Beach Boys, Oasis and newer bands like the Libertines and Kings of Leon etc, this is still the best thing I have heard.

0385491026|4.0|This book was my first introduction to Margaret Atwood and I started out in true awe of her writing power, especially her incredible inclusion of smell and senses.   <br /> <br />This novel, which reads like a memoir, is about an artist returning to her hometown of Toronto for an exhibition, where she is haunted by memories of her childhood friend Cordelia.  The first part of the book, which relates her childhood, is vivid, moving and powerful.  It created a tension that kept me turning the pages. <br /> <br />But as the main character moved into adulthood, I felt the string holding the story together weaken.  I kept waiting for something I felt had been foreshadowed earlier, but it didn't come.  Readers don't get to know the adult Elaine with the same intimacy as they know the child.  When pieces were left unresolved, I wondered why I had spent so much time reading about her adult life when the core of the book was concentrated in the first half.  <br /> <br />I was intrigued enough by Atwood's style to try out some more of her work.  This book is a good read, especially in the first half, but the second half was a letdown for this reader. <br />
1563899426|5.0|Recently, I have found myself being drawn closer and closer to the world of Graphic Novels.  Now, I do not speak of the ones that the teenie boppers are clobbering themselves over, but instead the dark sinister tales that are being woven by some of the masters of the trade.  I am speaking of Frank Miller, Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore, and Jamie Delano.  Now, with the greatest of comfort, I can add Bill Willingham to that list.  I know there are probably more (possibly better) graphic novel artists out there, but these are the foundation on which I am building up from.  I know they can only get better from here.<br /><br />But, back to Bill Willingham.  After my wife graduated with a Master's in Children's Literature, and even sometime before, I began to see the utter chaos and darkness surrounding these tales that help the youth of our future sleep at night.  They have been glossed over in years past by the subliminal corporation known as Disney, and lost that eerie creep factor that they long deserved.  You cannot tell me that Alice in Wonderland is a colorful story that should be told to every three-year-old out there ... I don't think I could say that.  In my eye I have always envisioned it as this dark hole that she falls into, a sinister nightmare that I think has only been captured well on film by famed director Jan Svankmajer.  Now, with Willingham's writing, I can see that darkness emerge again.<br /><br />Fables: Legends in Exile is a perfect introductory to the new world of infamous children's characters.  After fleeing their homeland, these magical and mysterious people have been forced to find refuge in none other than NYC.  Here, Willingham takes us through mazes of people as we learn their rituals, their magic, and their secrets.  In this first book we learn about the murder of Rose Red, Snow White's sister, in a classic \\"who-dun-it\\" mystery with our very own gumshoe played by Mr. Wolf.<br /><br />I enjoyed this graphic novel for several reasons.  The first is the intermingling of classic characters with the real world.  Those who use this as a central focus to their stories normally capture my attention quickly.  For so long we have stared at these characters, watching their lives unfold as we sit on our couches or bed, it is nice to see them up and walking around in our world now.  Also, by brining them into the real world you give them the opportunity to be more than just one-dimensional characters.  They curse, lie, steal, have sex, and all those dark, gritty things that you would have never imagined as a child.<br /><br />Second, the story was simple yet effective.  While I thought the ending left a bit of cheese on the table, overall I was impressed with this first outing.  The storied moved briskly, yet left enough open for more stories to follow.  I loved this world Willingham created for me, and I cannot wait to go back into it with the second book.  It was this sense that I was getting to know the characters and couldn't wait to revisit them again.<br /><br />Finally, the artwork was perfection on paper.  I am continually impressed by the work that graphic artists do to not bring in so much light on the page, but instead show the world in the dismal state of which we live.  It is an honest novel that has just as much creativity and passion as you would see in any film.<br /><br />I loved it, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get into graphic novels (like I am doing) or to anyone that just loves to read an original tale involving those characters that we assumed we knew.  I cannot wait to read it again!<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****The first is the intermingling of classic characters with the real world.

B00063EMJG|3.0|It's this simple... <br /> <br />1) If you are unfamiliar with the works of Neil Young and want a decent sampling of his music and don't care about higher quality recordings, skip this package and just get the standard one disc release <br /> <br />2) If you are unfamiliar with the works of Neil Young, want a decent sampling of his music and like higher quality sound recordings, get this package. <br /> <br />3) If you are a fan of Neil's, it boils down to this--If you like higher quality sound in your CD music, get this version.  If you could care less about the higher quality, skip it...unless you are totally fanatical and are willing to pay $20+ for two videos. <br /> <br />That's about it in a nutshell.
B0007NFL18|1.0|This album was surprisingly horrible. Not like 50's a good rapper or anything but he usually has the ability to make a pretty hot song. This album is wack compared to \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" and I think 50's overconfidence in the rap game has costed him big on this one. Game's album was way better and, in my opinion, was the best album to come out of G-Unit. The sad thing is this album will prolly go platinum within the first week. That just shows you where rap is headed and what people want nowadays. Its not lyrics and actual talent anymore. I'll be looking forward to Fat Joe and Styles' new albums coming soon. It's time someone shut 50 down.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|Ray Charles was fabulous.  This album is not. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this album.  Ray Charles was a consummate performer and musician, whether it be jazz, pop, or traditional standards.  However, this album is very weak.   <br /> <br />The duets style approach is interesting on face value (it sort of worked for Frank Sinatra several years earlier), but the performances do not carry any energy.  Ray sounds very weak during most of the album and it is quite sad to hear such a powerhouse in his final months. <br /> <br />You are much better off buying \\"His Ultimate Collection\\" or his classic 1950's recordings.   <br /> <br />
B0007Y08I8|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS F*CKING AMAZING!!! BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
B00001OH7Y|5.0|I've been a loyal fan of Bowie since the late 70's, some of his albums can move you some of them can make you wish you didn't buy them. <br />(They all deserve a listen to...) <br />Scary Monsters has always been a favorite of mine, the creative energy <br />is inspiring and feels right. Give it a few chances........ <br />I think DB is feeling the times out, pushing his endless creativity to <br />levels not seen by artists of his time(Sorry, I'm partial). <br />This album is light years ahead of most modern rock, I think <br />you'll agree.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I thought overall the movie was pretty good. I think a lot of people hated it because it's very different from the musical which is extremly popular and well known. It also doesn't have much similarity to Leroux's original novel. The movie had a lot to live up to and it didn't live up to it at all. I found that most of my friends who really loved it weren't that famaliar with the story or had never seen the musical. Friends who had seen the musical were a bit more critcal. Being a die hard Phantom fan myself I did find myself getting quite annoyed with some aspects of the film. Now for the good and the bad: <br />Good- <br />The cinematography was beautiful. There were some awesome scences in the movie (Christine's father's grave) which were absoulutly breath taking. Masquerade scence was pretty well done but wasn't as good as seeing it live. Rossum did a mostly good performance of Christine. She has a good voice and portrayed her innocence well. Her's was one of the better singing performances. The guy who played Rauol also did surprisingly well for the character. Everyone knows Rauol is a whining babbling wuss but I didn't find him as annoying in the film. Butler did okay, but I'll get to him later. I also was surprisngly feeling for the Butler at the end. I didn't think his acting would persaude me to do so but it actually did. The acting overall was mostly enertaing and kept me watching. <br />Bad- <br />The lip sinking was horrible. It didn;t even look like they were singing, especially Rossum. It really bugged me because I'm a singer and I KNOW you can't sing with your mouth an inch open. It's kind of ironic that Driver was the most believable singing and she was the only one in the movie who didn't use her actual voice. Okay, I know a lot of people hated Butler and I mostly agree with them. They could have found someone way better. He isn't an altogher bad singer, he was just miscast. They should have found someone with more of a range to their voice. I kindafeel bad for the guy cause when you think of the Phantom you think of Micheal Crawford, and he's hard to beat. Crawford and Sarah Brightan were sooo good and it's hard to match them. Okay the sword fight with Raoul and the Phantom. What was that? We all know Erik could destroy Rauol in a heartbeat. The end of that fight was just stupid. And that backstory with madame giry was horrible. If Erik didn't build the Oprea house then why were there so many secret passageways and how could he be a great arcitect without traveling the world? They just did that to give miranda richardson more screen time. Also, Erik's face wasn't even scary. He barely had a scratch. The thing that bugged me the most was the ending scene. There is no possible way that Erik could have put the ring on her grave. He was 50 when she was 18. He was obvousily not around when she eventually died. <br />Conclusion- <br />To apperiate the film you have to see it as just that: a movie. If you start comparing it to the musical or the book you're going to end up being disappointed. It doesn't hold a candle to the musical. I think it's just something that's more enjoyable live. I would recommend the movie because it's entertaining but don't expect too much or you'll end up disappointed.
B00005JLFC|5.0|This is such a \\"GOOD\\" film. I have the album,vhs which has been transferred to another case to enable my viewing. It is a heartfelt story with love of family, commitment, endeavors. Without the bad 4 letter words. If you like Barbra, this is thee <br />One! Please... make into DVD!!!!  We need more good in our lives.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The movie was very nice, very touching... I want to buy this DVD but I still have to wait a while for it to come out. I think that the cast brought the movie alive, especially the scenery. But the only thing that confuses people is why the old lady in the beggining is younger than old Raoul. Well, she is not Madame Giry, but Madame Giry's daughter Meg! I can't believe lots of people started to hate the movie just because of that one mess-up that isn't a mess-up after all!!
B0007P3582|1.0|what are you talking about. Nas and Jadakiss will murder this clown. Nas probally has more money then 50 Cents because 50 probally flushed it down the tank. I am sorry for doing this DI but this review by you was kind of nuts. How about like me you review the other CD off the album and not the biacies.
B00018TI5E|4.0|While nearly each of these songs are very good, some of them seem to short (Second Walk), and songs like this make it sound like parts of the album were thrown together as they were. It doesn't sound like there was very much time put into ordering the tracks or actually listening through the beginning of the first track and the three 'noise' tracks to see just how annoying they were.  <br /> <br />Though I'm currently in love with 'The Slaughter' (favorite track on the album), it seems more like a demo version of a song than the song itself. Another thing I would like to point out is the ability to hear the drummer of the song muttering the metronome (1... 2... 1, 2, 3, etc.) just before the song begins. Though this doesn't take away from the experience, it just doesn't make it sound like there was much work put into the overall sound. This Cold is actually overall a pretty simple song, but every album needs some radio-friendly songs. 18 songs also seems to be too much for an album, and some of them I find sound similar to others.  <br /> <br />Two of the songs I can't stand: the first two 'noise' tracks. The first one I skip every time I hear it, the second one I let run on until the sound begins to become more distorted. The third noise track, however, I actually go back to listen to a lot (a good lead into The Slaughter), and is sort of reminiscent to Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Now, the good points: Carvel, despite the long minute and a half intro, is a great starter, and was one of my initial favorites. Omission I didn't like as much as everyone else, but still a good song. Regret is another good song; sometimes I find myself wishing it was longer, but then I don't think it could be succesfully done without running on or keeping it's feeling. Wednesday's Song is a noteworthy track, along with 'Song to Sing When I'm Lonely,' 'Time Goes Back,' and 'In Relief' (the last three being adjacent, ironically). 'Water' is sort of catchy, but I just can't find myself enjoying it as much as the other songs. 'Cut-Out' and 'Chances' fall victim to being a part of an 18-track album. When there are too many tracks, some are lost in the loop, and songs like these two that are worthy for memorable listens are sometimes forgotten. '23 Go in to end' I like because of it's longevity, and the only one of the noise tracks I don't skip over. <br /> <br />My favorite song on the album, The Slaughter, is amazing. Perfect close to the album, and I really love the lyrics. Probably one of the most memorable songs on the album for me, and is a great outro. <br /> <br />Memorable songs: Carvel, Omission, Regret, Every Person, Wednesday's Song, Song to Sing When I'm Lonely, Time Goes Back, In Relief, 23 go into end, the slaughter.
0385510438|2.0|I am from Mississippi and went to school at Ole Miss, so, I am supposed to love John Grisham's books. I used not be able to wait until the next book came out.  <br />I find his books to all be cut from the same cloth. What happened to the great suspense books like The Firm and The Pelican Brief? It seems to me that Mr. Grisham is losing his passion for writing. Much like the main character in this book, I think that Mr. Grisham is just trying to produce a story fast enough to meet a deadline set by his publisher and just good enough to pass the minimum requirements needed to sell a few copies.  <br />In a nutshell, Mr. Grisham's books are becoming steadily worse. My advice--don't waste your time reading this book.

His shows are some of the most insane expeiriences ever. \\"I Get Wet\\" starts the party and just never stops you from headbanging. This album is great to just go crazy to. \\"Party Hard\\" and \\"She is Beautiful\\" are my favs plus they were the hits. If you want some music to go crazy to buy Andrew W.K.'s albums. Best party music out there!
B00005JLZN|5.0|THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE is an intense, well crafted and brilliantly acted drama.  Although there may be clues as to the actual fate of Constance, director Alan Parker keeps them as veiled as possible, and I found myself enthralled with the story of the anti-death penalty Gale and his assistant Constance, who he is accused of raping and murdering.<br /><br />What holds the film together is the cast:  Kevin Spacey gives one of his most impassioned performances; Kate Winslet is exceptionally good as the reporter who starts out resenting her assignment and then crusades to prove Gale's innocence; Laura Linney is breathtaking as the doomed Constance, proving once again she is one of the finest actresses out there right now; Gabriel Mann does a bang-up job as Winslet's intern partner, Zach.  Equally impressive are Melissa McCarthy as the goth girl, Nico; Matt Craven as the mysterious cowboy and Leon Rippy as the ambivalent lawyer.<br /><br />The ending is powerful and even if we should have seen it coming, Winslet's reaction more than compensates.<br /><br />I think this is a very good and worthwhile film.
B0002EXH40|4.0|This is a good album. Heavy and straight to the point. We may never hear this type of Megadeth again. We still have about 8 hours of good stuff from previous albums to keep us satisfied. If you don't like the song \\"VICTORY\\" you are not a Megadeth fan.
B00008RV1L|5.0|\\"Do you like Phil Collins? I have been a huge Genesis fan since their 1980 album, DUKE\\", states batemen. AWESOME. I would put American Psycho along with Office Space as the two most underrated movies of all time.      Christian Bale is absolutely brilliant as Patrick Batemen. How did this guy not get nominated for an Oscar from this role?  The movie's ending kinda wrap's up if the violence is real or imagined. The movie showed just enough restraint to keep you guessing though. Amazing cast. Hilarious dialogue. This film is black comedy, not a horror film at all. The UNRATED version has longer threesome sex scene and some subtly changed dialogue.     Fav Scenes:  1. Let me see Paul Allen's Business Card  2. Could you keep it down, I am trying to do...  3. Batemans speech on the importance of Phil Collins  4. Can I get reservation for 9:00 possibly...    This girl I went out with described me as being similar to Patrick Batemen. Must be my Phillippe Starck themed living room and my fondness for 30 dollar facial products. Anyway...GET THIS MOVIE. IT IS A MUST TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|While I'm not a huge Sarah fan, I enjoyed her voice and her ability to weave emotional themes and dramatic medlodies with electronic flourishes, ever since a music-lover friend introduced me to Touch in 1992.  Touch, although clearly a first effort, was original enough to be noteworthy at the time and started the buzz that earned her the label of being a more modern, pop Kate Bush.  Fumbling Towards Ecstacy and Surfacing were such huge hits and such wonderful, rich collections of songs that it seemed inevitable that she'd have a hard time topping her previous success, and for the most part, that seems to be true. <br /> <br />I think that you have to take a few things into consideration when listening to this album.  First, becoming a parent changes your whole world, your perspective, and the amount of time and energy you can devote to creating music.  Tori Amos' music now does not sound the same as her music before having a child.  I am not a parent, but I have heard interviews with musicians who have stated that having a child dramatically changed their musical ambitions.  For the most part, it's a happy experience and \\"happy\\" doesn't make for the same muse that pain, depression and youth does.  Second, it's really rare for an artist to consistently produce groundbreaking music.  At some point, you're either just out of great ideas, or your vision runs at odds with your former fans. <br /> <br />That said, I was dissapointed in this album because it seemed so ordinary compared to her other releases.  There's a fine line between lush-yet-strange-and-original singer/songwriter ballads and \\"lite FM\\" forgettable filler, and Afterglow strays across that line too many times to make this album a success.  Until her voice picks up in \\"Train Wreck\\", I could have sworn it was Seal I was listening to.  It's the same beautiful voice, the same layers of piano, guitar and orchestra that she's previously used...but it doesn't work this time.  Maybe too much time has passed and too many younger, fresher Sarah sound-alikes have popped up for her to sound relevant or unique anymore.  Maybe it's because she wrote the music for Afterglow on piano and not guitar, as was her previous method.  Maybe it's overproduced.  Or maybe music is just not the priority for her that it used to be, and she'll fade from the public eye entirely. <br /> <br />Anyone interested in buying this album who does not own Touch, Solace, Fumbling Towards Ecstacy or Surfacing, should explore those albums first.  Then if you're still interested, or are already a Sarah fan that owns all of the above - go for it, but don't expect to be laid bare by the lyrics that feel like they strike to the heart of your deepest pain or joy, or swept away by the romance of her compositions - because it's not there.
B0000024JN|5.0|If you really sit down and take in all the music on this CD you'll understand it was really ground breaking when it was released, lot's of people can't get past the dorky, obnoxious presence they had then, but the music is excellent. The rapping blends perfectly with the beats in every song, it's produced by Rick Rubin and there's a guest shot from Kerry King of Slayer! Excellence, period. Everyone should own this CD.
B000002KDI|5.0|I would argue this is Neil's best live album.  It starts out with Neil on 12 string guitar and harmonica doing his classics 'Sugar Mountain', 'Comes A Time', and then 'I Am A Child' (in my view his best versions of these songs). Neil then moves to his piano for 'After the Gold Rush' and onto some of his best rock masterpieces, doing songs like 'Powderfinger' and 'Cortez the Killer', again my favourite versions of these songs. He also does other classics such as 'Cinnamon Girl', 'Like A Hurricane', and 'Hey Hey My My'. Apparently some of these tracks, especially 'Cortez' are edited quite a bit from their original LP versions, but personally I don't believe you could ever complain of their quality - they are truly amazing.  The guitar work is some of Neil and Crazy Horse's best, the sound and music quality considerably better than his 'Weld' live 2CD album.  The DVD is also excellent (I own both), and is a true classic.  You can't know Neil until you've heard this.
0316096199|4.0|The book, Lucky, was a good book for all people. It was a real detailed novel. It made me think about how I present myself to others and what could happen when I am alone. Even though it is a true story, a lot of girls will turn to the novel for reference and support. I rate the novel, Lucky, 4 stars.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is easily in my top 5 for greatest albums ever released. Everything here is perfect, The recording quality is the best, and the songs are brilliant. Much more keyboarding is noticed here, and it has more of a synth/techno-ish sound to it than the other albums. It easily has some of the best lyrics with catchy songs like \\"Enjoy the silence\\" \\"policy of truth\\" and \\"sweetest perfection\\" even \\"Halo\\" is great. \\"Clean\\" is one of my all time favorite songs by Depeche Mode, maybe even THE  best one, even though it isn't their most well known one. Heck all the songs are great. There is much more emotion here too with the songs, with feelings of depression, loneliness, even happiness at times. Overall, a masterpiece that everyone should hear.  <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|I first got into them when i heard \\"I'm Not Okay..\\" on the radio months ago. I was driving and banging my head at the same time. I almost got into an accident! I was always really too lazy/broke and reluctant to buy the cd so i asked for it for christmas.. when i first sat down to listen I thought it was okay. I thought everything sounded the same, but then I gave it a chance and just kept it playing and soon enough I was tapping my foot and screaming the lyrics at the top of my lungs. It has honestly been the only cd i've been listening to since christmas. I even introduced them to my cousin and she is now addicted too. After a few weeks i ran out and bought their first album, \\"I Brought You my bullets, you brought me your love.\\" and thats amazing also. It's got a different feel tho. It's more of a \\"lemme slit my wrists\\" type of cd. The band has said that they wanted to write very ironically. This one has very dark lyrics but crazy happy tunes. You can't help but sing the lyrics and be happy when you do.  This is just a cd for pure rockin out! whether your by yourself or with your friends i guarantee if you put this in, you'll have a grand ol' time. Recommended songs. (it's hard to choose favorites.. but i try..) Thankyou for the Venom, Give Em' Hell Kid, To The End, I'm not Okay, The Ghost of You, Cemetary Drive, I never told you what i do for a living. (thats basically every song lol) HAVE FUN!
B00000099Y|5.0|Think a heavier version of Pink Floyd.  Songs are long, rather intelligent and the listener needs to be patient to appreciate it.  Over half the songs are aggressive, but the singer has a subtle voice that will please radio-friendly fans.  Heck, there has been a slew of bands that have and still are using his vocal approach.   <br /> <br />The percussion is what really stands out on this album.  There is a lot of intricate parts, but nothing that takes away from the songs focus.   Do yourself a favor, and try to drown all parts, but the drums to see what I mean.    <br /> <br />The only downer on the cd is the in between jingles/or non-songs.  Nothing that can't be solved with a skip of the button though.  At the time, this was a nice new direction in the Heavy Metal music genre. and it still holds its own today.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|You're twenty-something, at the crossroad in your life, maybe you hate your job or your relationship is in trouble...we've all been there.  But things don't really get grim until you throw the end of the world into the mix.  Which is exactly what happens to the eponymous Shaun of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".  Every day is the same and his life is going nowhere, which is precisely what has gotten him dumped.  His college era friendships are looking a little long on the tooth, and he has no career to speak of.  Fortunately, a zombie plague is giving him the opportunity to show his true mettle. <br /> <br />What is perhaps most engaging about this film is that while it is a parody, with numerous flat out hilarious moments, it is also offers up some genuine thrills, a bit of romance and a surprisingly realistic portrayal of the strains and emotion of an end of the world type scenario.  The film begins simply enough with Shaun reeling through life, largely detached from the surrounding world.  Until one day his routine falls rather alarmingly apart when the urban zombies he encounters turn out to be actual zombies. <br /> <br />As Shaun and his ne'er do well pal Ed set out to rescue his mother and his girlfriend the directors do a nice job of whipsawing from parody to drama to horror and back again.  While \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is first and foremost a comedy, it offers some surprisingly poignant moments, including Shaun's reconciliation with his badly mauled stepfather.  Of course, it offers the best fight sequence set to Queen since \\"Highlander\\"; although this one doesn't involve swords, so don't take things to seriously. <br /> <br />What lends to the comedy, and also to the interesting dynamic, is that the cast is made up exclusively of normal people.  No cops, not even any security guards; no one with martial arts training, etc.  When Shaun's band finally gets their hands on a gun, none of them can hit a thing with it.  Moreover, they fight and backbite, and while Shaun does rise to the occasion, he is far from infallible. <br /> <br />The most interesting aspect of these relationships is that between Shaun and his recently ex-girlfriend Liz.  She dumps him because he was doing nothing with his life, but now that he's making a go of it, the circumstances hardly seem right.  The directors insert their give and take in to the flow of the action perfectly; their interaction is never out of context or over the top.  A such, it has more in common with old time Hollywood romances that it does with the over the top grope-fests one expects today, and the result is a certain sweetness that nicely offsets the rather grim setting. <br /> <br />Offering laugh out loud moments, a few nice chills and some really interesting social commentary, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" was a surprisingly complex movie.  While it nicely lampoons just about every zombie film you've ever seen, it is hardly derivative.  Those who enjoyed Max Brooks' book \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" will particularly appreciate the film as much of the comedy is the subtle, tongue in cheek satire the British do so well.  That said, don't rule \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" out just because you're not a fan of the genre; it's one of the more unique films you're ever likely to see and a real treat. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman
B000002H4Q|5.0|Todavia no paro de entender a la gente que dice que este disco es una ensalada de estilos y por eso cualquier cosa.Me atreveria a creer que esa gente come basura, y se conmueve con cosas mas superficiales y livianas (o sea, sin sentido o sacandose cartel de que la tienen toda, caso el hip-hop de ahora o el new metal que es un asco).Hablando del Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me atreveria a decirles a todos ustedes mis queridos, que es tremendo disco y muestra a los Cure en su mejor momento, demostrado por la gran cantidad de estilos que abarcan en esta placa (sino comparen Hot Hot Hot, Catch y Torture, solo por nombrar algunas) y tambien por las letras que como siempre tienen una nota aparte y colocan a nuestro Robertito Smith en el olimpo del Rockn'Roll como una figura mas (indiscutible).Para mi esta formacion de los Cure fue la mejor,y para mi aunque todo el mundo odie a Lol,incluido Mr. Smith,se hace notar en el disco y muestra lo buen musico que es (por algo estuvo desde el principio hasta este disco, ya que despues se marcho, o lo hecharon por problemas legales, de bebida y adiccion al juego).Despues de esto los Cure allanaron el camino para la obra de arte postuma que fue su siguiente placa (DISINTEGRATION) que los termino por consagrar.
B0007Y08I8|4.0|This is very simply a hilatrious movie in the vien of South Park. Trey Parker and Matt Stone brilliantly paordy everyone from Michael Moore to Kim Jong Il. More importantly, it makes fun of those horrific Bruckheimer actions movies. I hate puppets, but I love this movie. The only reason I don't give this five stars is because it does go way over the top.
0780622553|5.0|This is a truly great movie. While the requisite special effects are present (especially at the end) it is the acting that shines through. Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, and Richard O'Brien give spot on performances. Kiefer Sutherland is less successful in his attempt to channel the late Peter Lori.<br /><br />This film along with Gattica are some of the few true Sci Fi classics of the 1990's. While wrapped in crunchy Film Noir shell the premise harks back to the great 1950's Sci-Fi pot boilers:<br /><br />Evil Aliens have hijacked a bunch of poor sap humans to do nefarious experiments on them. It seems \\"the strangers\\" (a.k.a. the evil aliens) can remake physical reality by will alone. Not only that but they can mess up peoples memories. Again we are were great Sci Fi lives and breaths; dealing with questions of what is the essence of reality and what make us human (and therefore unique.)<br /><br />One of the reason I love this film is it dares to be a true Sci-Fi film.  Most \\"Sci-Fi\\" is some other genre in drag. Star Wars is a Saturday Matinee Western tarted up in outer space garb and then pumped up on special effects steroids.  The Matrix while originally a good Magna/Sci Fi premise got lost in own myth. The arc of The Matrix was a very nasty downward curve, ending in the sickening splat that is Matrix 3. While The Matrix and Dark City do have the commonality of a unifying and overarching style, the Matrix suffers in the comparison. In the Matrix we have style for style's sake. Everyone in the Matrix is spending way too much time being far too cool.  By the last installment the only characters I cared about were the Oracle and the little Indian girl.<br /><br /> In Dark City the characters never slip into caricatures.  It's the little things, William Hurt's loving caress of his \\"mother's\\" old accordion and the pained expression on his face when he can't remember an important detail about that same accordion.  It's the real fear on Kiefer Sutherland's face when confronted with having go to \\"Shell Beach\\". It's in a hundred of little details throughout the film.  The style is there, it's there in hundreds of little Noir details, but the style never overwhelms the substance.<br /><br /> Talking about downward spirals, Star Trek is another great example of good Sci Fi premise ending in very bad way.  While starting out shaky with the first installment, Star Trek hit a good stride with Wrath of Khan, stumbled with Shatner's overblown contribution to the cause and then passed the baton brilliantly to new kids on the block with The Undiscovered Country /  Star Trek Generations. Then the whole affair went into free fall ending with the craptastic waste of time that is Star Trek Nemesis. I bring up Star Trek because it illiterates what is wrong most big budget Si-Fi ,that is the lack of imagination in their alien life forms.  With all that money and supposed talent running around all we get is the nine millionth derivation of little green men. Dark City gave us a brief view of the aliens true form and it really got outside the box. The strangers look like a cross between a tapeworm from hell and an overgrown hydroid .  This is exactly what one can expect from a few billion years of evolution on totally different world. Again this is brilliant (I will admit the animation / CGI is substandard even by 1990's standards)<br /><br />A final note, if you will  excuse the pun, about the music in this movie.  The main theme is a luscious bit orchestration that can be listen to on its own merits and  Trevor Jones nails each and every scene with the right music.<br /><br />At its present price this movie is an absolute steal and should be in any Noir or Sci Fi fan's collection.nd's face when confronted with having go to \\"Shell Beach\\".

B0007O38F8|1.0|Is this nigga crazy???  This cd is trash.  I got a bootleg of this like in the middle of February and as many times as I've tried to listen and like this cd I just can't.  I really don't believe that so many people gave this album 5 stars.  This is the most whack cd I've heard in a long time.  After GRODT I thought he was a decent rapper that just brough it hard with the beats and hooks from that cd.  Even on most songs by other artists that featured him, his raps were tight, but man I couldn't imagine in a million years that this cd would suck this bad.  There's only about 4 songs on the cd that I actually like, and 2 of them are almost already played out due to the radio.  I liked Gatman and Robbin for about a day, but even Em's verse is weak on that track.  From the beginning people said this nigga was a fake and I believe that now.  I mean honestly to be such a gangsta, how can you get shot 9 times with no retaliation, the people who shot and stabbed your b*tch A$$ are gangsta's not you 50.    And of course the most talked about track \\"Piggy Bank\\".  This has the worst hook of all time on it, and what he says about the other rappers is on an elementary level.  Jada & Nas are way more talented rappers than him.  Has he never heard ETHER??  Nas put Jay-Z to shame on that track and 50 comes with \\"This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots..After your next move I'll give you what I got\\"  What the f*ck???  C'mon if you are gonna come out and diss somebody you come hard don't come with a taste of what's to come \\"after\\" they make a retaliation of the sh*t you put out first.  \\"How to Rob\\" was a funny, but good diss track at best, and Hail Mary (the best Ja Diss) would've been sick if it weren't for that fact that 50 copied Pac's verses from Against All Odds and the original Hail Mary. He's all about hype and he's all about himself.  He really got rich and quit tryin to make good music.  Eminem rapped with Fat Joe on the lean back remix, so you gonna go against him now too?  He said that if his record sells one copy less than the first record than he considers it a failure..well even though he may have sold 1.1 mill in 4 days I'll promise this cd won't go 5x platinum.  I was riding with a buddy from work to lunch and we were in a Chik-fil-a drive thru.  I let him hear the cd because he hadn't heard it yet.  His honest to God remark about the cd---\\"You ever seen what happens when you put a cd in the microwave?...No..\\"You should try it, and start with this cd\\".  I couldn't stop laughing cuz i thought it was hilarious.  Thank God I didn't buy this crap because it aint worth my 10 Nickels.  You ever notice how every rapper murders 50 on his own sh*t...Nas and Jada are gonna have a field day with this.  He came down here to Panama City Beach for spring break when he first broke big and I saw him in concert...That sucked, and I still want my damn $35 back from that and it's 2 years later.  On second thought it may have been worth it ONLY because I met some fine A$$ spring breaker while I was in line before the show and took her home later that night.  This just makes me look forward to the new Kanye West Cd, because rap needs a Savior, and he's the closest thing to helping the rap game in my opinion.  All rappers nowadays talk about the same thing. \\"I'll kill you, I drive a benz, bentley, range rover, lexus on 24's spinning, I got your b*tch in the passenger seat grinning.  I got Tv's in my headrest, I'll pop a cap in yo chest, I'm making money b*tch, I'm f*cking rich, but all my raps still sound like sh*t\\".  COME ON PEOPLE, can you belive these idiots get paid millions of dollars to rearrange what 60 other Niggas rapped about on their songs?  This is ridiculous.  [...]

B0007O38F8|5.0|Dam is this CD hot. 1-22 50 explodes and proves he can switch styles \\"get in my car\\" and \\"amazing\\" opposite both equally dope. And then he drops a diss song \\"piggy bank\\" then drops a club song \\"candy shop.\\" This boss ain't stoppin anytime soon and neither is his whole crew g-unit , shady , aftermath. Also his remix of love it or hate it is so dope. This whole cd is DOPE. Get em boys.
0689835604|5.0|My child loves this book.  It's peek-a-boo with excitement for little ones.  Multiple ethnicities enhance this gem.  The words are in large print for visual stimulation and are good for visually impared readers.  Children may want to grab at the flaps inside.  My copy is worn already with loving attention.  Children will learn  the words \\"behind\\" and \\"under\\" relating to this book.  I'm hoping for more hide and seek books from Ms. Katz in the future.
B000002IKR|5.0|This is Testament's debut album and one of the best thrash albums EVER.If you are starting your thrash collection,this should be one of the first albums you buy.Everything about this album is classic.It also features one of my favorite lead guitarists,Alex Skolnick,who is the best thrash guitarist,hands down.It also features one of my favorite bassists,Greg Christian.The album kicks off with \\"Over The Wall\\",which is one of my favorite thrash songs,and my favorite here.Up next is \\"The <br />Haunting\\",which is my third favorite on here.Great riff,great solo.Up next is the concert favorite \\"Burnt Offerings\\",which isn't as good as the first 2,but is still really good.Up next is \\"Raging Waters\\".This one has some pretty evil lyrics,but Chuck sings them pretty fast.Up next is C.O.T.L.O.D.DAMN this song is fast.Like \\"Raging Waters\\",this has pretty evil lyrics,but are sung fast.Up next is \\"First Strike Is Deadly\\".Great chorus and one of the best solos on this album.\\"Do Or Die\\"is the weakest song,but not bad at all.\\"Alone In The Dark\\"is my second favorite here.GREAT vocals on the bridge and a great solo.\\"Apocalyptic City\\" closes the album.Great chorus and the best solo on the album.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|Yes, Madeline Peyroux's voice bears an *uncanny* resemblance to Lady Day.  I found that a tiny bit distracting at first.  But, dedicated to keeping an open mind and not judging without considering, I gave 'Careless Love' another few listens.  I came to the conclusion that perhaps Madeline is not trying to emulate Billie, but she would probably have totally different vocal styling and phrasing if she had never heard Billie.     <br /> <br />Being a huge Elliot Smith fan, I just have to say that when 'Between the Bars' snuck up on me mid-CD, I totally got goosebumps--and they stayed a while.  Unbelievable.  Imagine hearing Billie Holliday do an Elliot Smith cover.  Haunting!  Other than that, the musical arrangements are subtle and warm and Peyroux's vocal phrasing is sublime. <br /> <br />'Careless Love' is a wonderfully rich, warm and thoughtful collection of covers (aside from one that Peyroux penned) that haven't been covered-to-death.  She has a wonderful voice and this is a great album in its own right, and certainly worthy of finding itself in any music lover's stereo.
0307010856|5.0|I loved this book so much when I was little!  It was the first book I was able to read on my own.  One of my favorite parts is the inside cover where Grover says \\"This is a very dull page.  Let us see what is on the next page\\" and then he flips out on the next page when he realizes what the name of the book means!  The first time I read this book I was so scared that there would be this big scary monster at the end of the book, and now that I'm older I laugh thinking about who the 'monster' actually was how scared I was along with Grover! <br /> <br />I love how creative and interactive this book is, with Grover trying to stop you from getting to the end of the book by building brick walls, and using rope to tie the pages together.  And I remember how much I laughed whenever I turned to the next page and all of Grover's hard work would be in shambles, with Grover buried in the wreckage.  I get so nostalgic thinking about this book, my favorite as a child, and still one of my favorites today!  I'm 18 now and I still love this book so much!  I can't wait to read it to all of my toddler cousins!
B000002J03|4.0|\\"Led Zeppelin II\\" is a heavy dose of blues and hard rock; not too disimlar from their debut, albeit not quite as bluesey overall. <br /> <br />There's lots of great moments on here, really. The raucous, sexy strut of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is a major highlight to kick off the album. Certainly one of Zep's most memorable rockers. <br /> <br />\\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" explores soft/loud dynamics nicely, and \\"Thank You\\" is one of their most genuine, beautiful love ballads. <br /> <br />\\"Moby Dick\\" isn't so much a song as a showcase for Bonzo's wicked drum solo. And \\"Bring It On Home\\" closes the album in a very bluesey fashion.  <br /> <br />Other highlights include the sleazy blues/rocker \\"The Lemon Song\\", the bitter \\"Heartbreaker\\", and the folksy rocker \\"Ramble On\\" (first evidence of Robert Plant's love of JRR Tolkien).  <br /> <br />Like their debut album, \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" has a gritty, rockin' blues feel throughout. It's not their best, but you really can't go wrong with it either. <br /> <br />
0786915749|1.0|I was a fan of dragonlance novels without ever reading these books.I am so happy that I read dragonlance other books by Dan Parkinson and Richard Knaak.They brought me into the dragonlance world and showed me how amazing it was. <br />This book.The entire trilogy infact is well.....boring.There is so much that could have been done with it to make it interesting.There is no good writing involved.Everything is rushed through and none of the characters are developed.If you liked other dragonlance books and want to have some trivia in your head read this book.But as a novel by itself it stinks.
B000002J09|5.0|\\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" is commonly referred to as one of the best rock albums of all time. Can't disagree there! <br /> <br />From the sleazy, psychedelic stomp of \\"Black Dog\\" to the towering blues epic \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", and everything in between - it's classic. <br /> <br />\\"Rock n' Roll\\" is a raucous take on a basic blues/rock progression. And even though it's currently being used to sell cars, it's still a fun tune that you can rock out to. <br /> <br />The mandolin-led \\"Battle of Evermore\\" is a lush, mystical prog-folk song with gorgeous vocals (and Tolkien inspired lyrics). And \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"..well, we all know that one. It's on here, and it's still amazing. <br /> <br />Other highlights include the hypnotic hippie shuffle of \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", the stripped down, accoustic \\"Going to California\\" (as delicate and beautiful as any LZ song), and the underrated \\"Four Sticks\\", which its manic 5/8 time riff.  <br /> <br />What else to say? Believe the hype, I suppose. \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" really is as good as they say..
B000002MZ6|3.0|If I could not see the cover of this album I could hardly imagine that this is another Oldfield's record. Hi-tech sounds fill this album from the very beginning to the end, far away from what Oldfield has been taking us traditionally.  <br /> <br />And despite this might not be necessarily a bad feature of this album, I think that Oldfield is going out of what I think he's good: a great guitar player and a good, imaginative composer... when he decides to be serious with whatever he's doing. <br /> <br /> So don't misunderstand me. If you want to try listening to Oldfield in another register (electronic, chill-out music) this album will show you what he can really do, a fine album in this style, but if you sleep every night with Ommadawn under your pillow... just RUN when you see this record!
B00008DDHZ|5.0|From the moment the opening credits begin (with a haunting and brooding score punctuated by nervous military radio banter) to the sombre closing credits (with a fine live version of u2 performing Sunday, Bloody Sunday) this picture, dramatising the unfortunate events of 30 January 1972, in Londonderry, N. Ireland grips you and--slowly, surely--winds the tension up like a spring. <br /> <br />Whilst I will avoid recounting the events of that terrible day (the previous reviews do that very well) and will avoid commenting on its historical accurateness (there's certain to be inaccuracies cited in this telling by historians, and, truth be told, the British do not represent well at all here [seeming so hateful and criminal as to be, at times, difficult to believe--but, maybe that's the point) I will say that the film feels amazingly real-that is, it is utterly convincing. Through a documentary styled presentation showcasing amazing and sharp acting performances, you are drawn in completely-you believe you are there. <br /> <br />Technically, this DVD is beautiful. The picture is presented in a gorgeous anamorphic 16x9 transfer with solid blacks and crisp and tight (if intentionally muted) colours. The audio is likewise full and punchy. You will notice that there are two feature audio track options: 1. A `Domestic' audio track (which is, in fact, a U.S. mix (domestic would mean the U.K., the film's place of origin), and 2. A U.K. release mix. The difference between the two is that the U.K. track has a much more spacious and pronounced ambient/surround mix, whereas the `domestic' mix reduces much of the ambience in favour of a louder (centred) dialogue track (most likely to aid the N. American audiences not conversant with the Irish accents and varying dialects featured so prominently in the film.) <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this film too highly. It is a fine example of what art can aspire to when embedded with a strong and passionate message.  <br />
B0007N1AI6|2.0|I was pretty psyched to hear that Priest was reuniting,although i've always been more of the 70's Sabbath fan instead of priest(to much leather for me).I started liking them after Painkiller a bit,then i really liked Jugulator because i'm more into the heavier kinds of metal,and i really loved Rippers versitile voice.Then came Demolition which was pretty bad,but then Halford shed some light on Metal with his two solo albums,which were great in my opinion.But this album just drags and doesnt have much energy,with the exception of maybe 3 songs.If halford had brought the young vibrant sound that he once had with Fight,and his solo records this would have really kicked major butt,unfortunately it sounds pretty old tired and to forced.Reminds me of when Sabbath reunited to record there new songs Pyschoman and Selling my Soul,you could tell they didnt have any fuel left.As with Maiden why don't the lead singers just stay with there solo stuff,it always seems to be 10 times better,via Bruce Dickinsons,Accident Of Birth,and Chemical Wedding.Same with Halford,it seems like he went from being back in high school(with his solos records),to joining up with some guys from a nursing home.(getting back with priest) <br /> <br /> <br />Plus's..Judas Rising,Lochness(to long though),and Demonizer.
B00003CWNR|1.0|We can start by analyzing the main character: Homer Wells. He is an orphan that did not have anywhere to go. A nice guy finds him a job. Homer is so grateful that when his friend his at war he gets involved with his friend's girlfriend. But I guess it's OK maybe because he's an orphan. Then we have a guy who he is having sex with his daughter and gets her pregnat. I guess it's OK because he truly loves her, oh and of course his life was also hard. Then we have the doctor in the orphonage, who instead of incentivating Homer (our \\"hero\\") to grow as a person lied to him his whole life about his health so Homer would stay with him. I guess it's OK because the doctor devoted his life to the poor orphans so he must be good right!?  So let me translate this movie for you. This is for people who are losers, and have no sense of dignity. This is for people who don't know what loyalty and friendship is. Since they can't stop being imoral and they feel bad about themselves they watch these movies searching for some relieve. Well you might take this aspirin today but you are still a loser.    PS- By the way I am not religious, nor anti-abortion (just in case you were looking for excuses to dismiss my review)
B0007O38F8|1.0|Hello, to all.  My review will at least attempt to be as honest as I can make it. <br /> <br />50 Cent.... has lyrical talent, I'm not talking about the bull crap cd's he has come out with in the past.  I'm talking about grimmy 50 Cent where he can freestyle with the best of them.  Eminem did not pick up 50 for being a \\"Trend\\" he picked him up because he has lyrical talent. <br /> <br />From what 50 Cent's excuse was that Dr. Dre and Aftermath were so busy with doing The Games CD that they pushed back 50's album, therefore causing a egotistic 50 to get mad and jealous because he was not under the lime light and go to outside sources.  He also said something along the lines as if the CD was a rush job and he was kidding on songs such as Piggy bank in which he was not writing seriously. <br /> <br />To me it sounded like he found some weird weed and started tripping off of it.  Everyone knows his feud with Game etc.  I'm not going to speak on this because honestly if the world does not allow the both of them to come to an agreement we could lose more rappers to the streets. <br /> <br />I hope these two brothers resolve their issues like real men and not ignorant gangasters as all the gangsters are laying dead in the ground as we speak. <br /> <br />50 Really needs to stop trying to impress the women and make the money and gain the respect of the public again.  I think if he writes his lyrics and lyrically expresses himselef verses this <br /> <br />I got money <br />I got shot <br />I got females <br />What you got? <br /> <br />Type stuff... it's like been there... done that.... ::Yawns:: everyone talks about that stuff..... <br /> <br />50 this was a really dissapointing album, I know there were problems and issues but I cannot support any of your albums until you clean up your attitude and your mind yo... your clouded. <br /> <br />
B000056VJ7|5.0|This album was the bomb when it came out, real different, Meatloaf had a great voice, I cant see him doing these songs today, he is way to old to scream like he did then. I think he would croak on stage trying to do these songs, anyways, I love the opening song, it really gets the album moving right along, \\"Mouth\\" is a decent tune if you with your girlfriend in the car and ready to pounce. I had read somewheres if Phil Ruzzuto knew what \\"Dashboard\\" was about he would have never done it, I think he would have, hes probably gotten lots of residuals for doing it...whos he kidding... great album, i recommend to anyone who has an open mind and doesnt judge the songs sheerly on lyrical content, the music rocks and Meatloaf really belts out these songs with all hes got.
B0001AP12G|2.0|I thought this was an OK album but far from a classic. It only has a few good songs (We don't care,I'll fly away,Slow jams,Last call,jesus walks) but thats about it. The rest are just fillers. And why is everyone saying he is talking about new stuff and hes fresh. The Roots and common and many other artist like this have been making music like this for years. All Kanye is doing is talking about this stuff on sampled beats to make hits. In almost every beat he makes there is a sample. No doubt he is a good beat maker but without sampling can he make a hit. I like the album but I dont think it as great as people on MTV and TRL say it is. His rapping skill is average at best. So overall an average 2 star album.
0743454529|2.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult novel, and will probably be my last. I mildly enjoyed the first third - but it was at that point I decided to sneak a peak at the last chapter. I couldn't have been more disappointed, but I continued with the rest of the story, with the hope that by the time I reached the end, the author would've miraculously rewritten a brilliant ending and pasted it into the final pages of my book. No such luck. <br /> <br /> Considering that I was able to finish the novel, I thought Anna was an OK character, and I enjoyed the premise, I gave this two stars instead of just one. However, it missed on all other counts: the characters were flat, underdeveloped and ridiculously cliched. Jesse could not have been more unbelievable as a \\"rebellious teenager\\" and the romance between Julia and Campbell was just plain silly and too romance novel-ish. Also, far too many of the sub issues in this novel (the romance, the pyromaniac son)seemed to be unrealistically solved in a quick sentence or two.As the other reviewers have mentioned, the ending was a total copout. I would've liked to see the author show a little more gumption in creating a solid ending.
B0000029GA|4.0|I like this album and it is a classic but not a 5 star classic. I'm a big Nas fan but as good as this album is its has a fall back, its to short. But other than that Nas shows off his great flow and story telling skills on all 10 tracks. Life's a bitch with AZ is the best song along with One Luv and It aint hard to tell. Get this album because it should be in your collection no matter what part of the country you live in. 4 Stars.
B00009RAJJ|4.0|This album, for me, was somewhat of a dissapointment. I am a long time Fleetwood Mac listeniner and thought that it would be worth the extra couple bucks to get the \\"bonus tracks\\". I find the second CD interesting, however, if you are simply looking for vintage Fleetwood Mac this is not the CD for you. The single cd edition is a much better, and much cheaper alternative. However, I would also suggest that with those extra couple bucks you saved to buy either \\"Tango in the Night\\" or \\"Rumours\\", neither of which will dissapoint.
B000059QY3|4.0|Alright..this will be short and sweet since Traviata should not be foreign to opera listeners: <br /> <br />Maestro Solti - Omits the traditional cuts of arias that are usually taken.  Excellent conducting of tempi, phrasing and color in most parts.  The introduction to the final act is very sublime and immediately sounds as if a bitter cold walked into Covent Garden. <br /> <br />Leo Nucci - too much wobble for my taste.  There were some notes where he would oversing and in turn it would sound horrible.  His singing in duets with Violetta or with Alfredo would always be hesitant.  Nucci would always be slightly ahead.  His arias sounded pushed and once again had too much wobble. <br /> <br />Lopardo - aside from the terrible costuming (trousers were up to his neck by the third act!) his singing was mediocre.  I have never been a fan of his singing due to the weight that he puts into it.  At some points he sounds like a french baritone.  For the aria \\"O Mio Rimorso,\\" the tempo was EXTREMELY slow and I almost felt as if he was not going to finish.  His high register has the sound but is missing the ping.  I did not hear a piano at all and by the end of opera the hoarseness in his voice was evident.  The acting... we won't go there. <br /> <br />Gheorghiu - Oh the year was 1994 and a star was born.  Without a doubt the singing was excellent.  Her colour is so different... a lyric coloratura with dark colour.. such a unique mix.  Act I was excellent.  Ah fors e lui.. wonderful sound - Sempre libera ... at some points the pitch was just there but the acting and the look only helped Angela.  She looks great, has the voice and knows how to use her instrument. <br /> <br />DVD is worth solely to see the birth of a star: Angela Gheorghiu.
B00008VGK0|3.0|Hello People. Madonna rapped in the song American Life that symbolized irony. Madonna knows shes no rapper but she rapped anyway. She did this to laugh at herself. because MTV caters mainly to rap music she wanted to do a rap verse.
B000059QY2|4.0|Rigoletto - Yes, the arias and recits were recorded and then added to the film.  There are some parts where the latter is evident; however, the film is a feast for the eye as the vocals are a desert to the ear. <br /> <br />Act I : Winer Philharmoniker under the direction of Maestro Riccardo Chailly is precise and captures the phrasing of this Verdian Opera.  The ballata is a reminder of the glory days of la voce di Pavarotti, and it brings into perspective the Italian ping that brought him the opera world at his feet.  The chorus is magnificently costumed and is a necessity in order for the opera to run smoothly.  The whole first act is a huge array of drunks, prostitutes, and food, being led by the host il Duca.  Pavarotti is not the best at acting.  In this film version, he is not that bad.  Most of the camera focuses on his face rather than on the body.. I wonder why?  Ingvar Wixell does a magnificent job at portraying the hunchback we have come to love - Rigoletto.  His singing and phrasing of the melodies is excellent. <br /> <br />Act II : This act focuses on the relationship between Rigoletto and his figlia Gilda.  The duet - Deh non parlate, is sung with great color and excellent phrasing.  Edita Gruberova is the perfect Gilda.  Her true lyric-coloratura voice is without a doubt a perfect match for the role that Verdi wrote.  Too many dramatic coloraturas or full lyrics sing the role of Gilda and unfortunately butcher it!  The famous aria: Caro nome, is where we come to hear the flute like tone of Ms. Gruberova.  She sings all the ornamentations that a soprano of the caliber that she possesses, in order to bring the house down.  Her trills are effortless and her range is magnificent.  Her legato is divine and her stacatti are mouth watering. <br /> <br />Act III: In this act, we have the aria that most legendary tenors have deemed the most difficult written by Verdi.  The issue deals with the tessitura of the aria.  It lies quite high on the register, whichcould lead to disaster if not properly sung.  Pavarotti does a marvelous job.  He attacks the aria with grace and uses his \\"ping\\" in order to stay above the notes and not below.  I am always amazed by the color of his voice, so bright and trumpet like... amazing.  I have heard recording of great tenors that have transposed the aria down a step. I have also heard recordings where by the last third of the aria, the tenor had modulated half a step.  Another great recording is Del Monaco singing the aria at La Scala during the mid 50's.  Parmi veder le lagrime is certainly difficult, but Pavarotti makes it sound easy and painless.  Amazing!!  The duet at the end of the act between Rigoletto and Gilda is heart wrenching.  Tutte le feste al tempio, written in e-minor,(a common key that Verdi uses between a father figure and his daughter), has such sorrow that it sometimes goes without notice.  Ms. Gruberova sings her heart out in this duet.  Her tone and emotional makeup have changed by this act.  She is no longer the young and nave Gilda of the act before, she is in pain and realizes that love hurts.  Great phrasing on her part and excellent singing on Mr. Wixell's part as well. <br /> <br />Act IV: The aria know around the world:  La donna  mobile, excellent - listen for yourself.  The quartet, perhaps the one that is the closest to perfection (next to the sextet in Il Trovatore) is sung with great technicality.  The phrasing is there at times, but it seems that too much time was taken in the recording studio.  The voices sound very rigid and manipulated.  All the notes are there but the feeling is missing.  There is nothing better than hearing this quartet live or in a CD recording ( I recommend the one with Milnes, Pavarotti, Sutherland and Bonynge conducting.  Final scene on the gondola is such a beauty to the eye.  The voice of Gilda, now disgraced in the eyes of her father and fatally wounded is such a joy to hear.  Great job!  <br /> <br />Overall: great singing, excellent conducting, Pavarotti shines, Gruberova gives a performance that should serve as reference for sopranos today and a magnificent job done by Ingvar Wixell playing Rigoletto.  4.25 out of 5 stars.  Enjoy!!     <br />
B00005YJMX|2.0|The problem with remaking classics films is that they can rarely live up to the standards of the original.  Such is definitely the case in the anemic remake of the classic German silent film, Nosfaratu.  Often times the vampire in this remake seems weak and ineffectual, as if Jonathan Harker should have been able to break him in two with a carefully placed karate chop.  When he speaks he comes across as whiney instead of menacing.  All of the actors seem to underplay their roles as if they were bored to death; there is a decided lack of human emotion.  The supernatural elements of the original film seem oddly missing.  The only thing the director really managed to do is create some breath-taking cinematography of rural europe. If you are a fan of the original film, my advice is to skip this remake and instead buy a copy of Shadow of the Vampire--which I feel is fresh and compelling.  It is a fictional account of the making of the original German classic.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|Michael Cretu amazed the world when his project Enigma married dance beats with the sounds of Gregorian chants in 1990. With Enigma's successful debut it was only inevitable that the concept would be imitated with varying degrees of success. Over the course of 4 albums Crety has mixed differnt elements into the Enigma concept and each has created  its own special soundscape. On \\"Voyaguer\\"- the 5th studio album Cretu wwants us all to believe that this album marks an entirely new direction for the act. Whether he believes this statement or if this a nice way of saying \\"I'm out of ideas\\" is up to the listener. Personally, I say don't believe all the pretentious reviews praising the album. If this album had been released under any other artist name it wouldnt have recieved any recognition.<br /><br />The album begins with the Enigma's trademark horn opening before being drown out with thumping dance beats. Lots of strange samples follow and and the next track begins. The album continues with a mixture of sounds. Some of the tracks are surprisingly good like the \\"the piano\\" while others border on cheese (Boum-boum). The album is overall a ho-hum mix of ambient music and generic eurodance that doesnt really take you on any kind of musical journey. I've listened to this album numerous times and still havent felt moved on any level. Definetly sample this cd before you commit to buy.
B00069A5GY|5.0|I'll skip the superlative merits of the songs themselves as I've covered that already, and tell you that with Knopfler you always get a GREAT sounding album. Enhanced with the DVD Audio format, it is almost too good to be true. Assuming you have a passion for well played, tasty guitar licks, it doesn't get any more sublime or sound any more intimate than this DVDA. I'd swear I can hear the strings being plucked! The balance throughout the disc is extraodinary, the dynamics letter perfect. The intimacy acheived and the presence and separation of the music is what is so incredible about this format and in the case of Knopfler, he takes the format to its optimum. Positively, I highly recommend this disc. As good as the first release was, this is just so much better. I can hardly wait for LOCAL HERO and RAGPICKER'S DREAM, CAL and TELEGRAPH ROAD.
B000002P5R|3.0|I don't quite agree with the previous review; i think this record lacks of something that i'm going to try to describe :  1 - the less important thing : the cover : in my opinion, this cover is awful and should fit better as the poster of a summer blockbuster sience fiction film.  2 - the sound of the music : i'm used to listening the four first records of Hendrix (i include here the 'Band Of Gypsys), and when i compared the sound of 'First Rays' with these records i can't help feeling there is something strange unnatural? in the sound of 'First rays'; Hendrix's sound is a sort of trademark in 'Are you Experienced' 'Axis' 'Electric Ladyland' and 'Band of Gypsys', here this trademark sound is somewhat lacking, absent, the sound seems too polished whereas a particularity of the sound of Hendrix in the records aforementioned is its rawness, i almost would say 'its crudeness'; there isn't enough both blues and psychedelia on this CD, a good blues track like 'It's too bad' with Larry Young would have been welcomed.  3 - The beginning of the record : i absolutely don't know which were the intentions of Hendrix with this record but in my opinion, i would have preferred that the record starts with an experimental instrumental track as this is the case for 'Axis' and 'Electric Ladyland', a sort of 'trademark' in the way by which Hendrix was beginning his records; in plus, and here again, in accordance with my tastes, i don't like at all the instrumental 'Beginnings' and i think there is a lot of better instrumentals of Hendrix than this one; 'Beginnings' mustn't be confused with the excellent 'Jam Back at The House' performed at Woodstock, what remains of 'Jam Back At The House' on 'Beginnings' is very basic.   4 - The choice, selection of the songs : not all the tracks are bad : Angel (i feel that the version on South Saturn Delta is by far my favorite), Freedom (good guitar parts, particularly by the end of the song, but personally i find the Isle of Wight version of thissong largely superior to this one), 'Ezy Rider' is a good song but here too i have got a problem with the mixes, i have been listening to an another version of this track with more psychedelia which is better; the title song 'Hey Baby (New rising sun)' is very promising, but it seems to be unfinished, the same can be said for 'Drifting', a good ballad - the second half of 'Drifting' is like a white page that James Marshall Hendrix surely would have completed had he lived enough for doing it; furthermore, i don't like the songs 'Room Full Of Mirror' or 'Dolly dagger' but perhaps there is better versions of these songs on other cd - i find 'Dolly Dagger' a little bit overrated and too radio-friendly for my taste, but here too, i must say i have been listening to a better version of this song on the Isle of Wight; 'Belly button Window' is an interesting minimalist blues song which reminds me of 'Up from the skies' on 'Axis' since the both songs share singing/guitar wah-wah pedal response; 'Izabella' is a good funky track with short guitar riff in the style of 'Little Miss Lover' on 'Axis' ( there is a much better version of this song with more psychedelia and by far finer than this one on the six CD box 'Astro Man', i don't know whether this box is still available).      As a result : this is not a classic, obviously, 'First Rays' is not on the same level and is inferior to 'Are You Experienced', 'Axis', 'Electric ladyland' (Electric Ladyland is far more achieved than this CD) and 'Band Of Gypsys; some good tracks aforementioned however make me give this record three stars, but it is difficult to me to give more in regard to the flaws i review above.
0316172324|2.0|The author references some very interesting studies, including how one professor is able to predict with 95% accuracy whether or not a married couple will still be married in 15 years by observing the couple for 1 hour and identifying some key behaviors. Overall though, the author never forms conclusions that can be applied to life. After reading the book, I wonder to myself, how am I better informed about making snap judgements than I was before? I honestly don't think I am. Good start to the book. Poor finish. Also, many of his anecdotes are lengthier than they need to be. All-and-all, it's thought-provoking, but not instructional at all.
0553213105|4.0|Austen is undeniably important in the history of british culture and the central themes of this book fully justify her position, particularly the idea of female emancipation. That said great themes do not make interesting reads (e.g anything  by Hegel). What makes this book is the writing, the prose is light and fast and you can't deny she has a sense of humour. Great book, makes it's points without bludgeoning you on the head.
B0007MYIOA|4.0|Anyone who grew up or spent any number of years in Jamaica or had close cultural exposure through parents\family should find this film very authentic and entertaining; especially if you are a fan of Dancehall Reggae and have familiarity with the contemporary culture.  What I found most entertaining was the brash and flamboyant nature of the gangsters (a.ka \\"shottas\\") and the authenticity of the patios and each character.  <br /> <br />Louie Rankin (also in Belly w/DMX) is a hysterically funny and course gangster who played well against the intensions of Biggs(Kymani) and Wayne(Spragga).  Spragga Benz was surprisingly engaging and executed a consistently cool \\"in control\\" demeanor, especially in the first half of the movie that was shot in Jamaica.   Paul Campbell who played the character \\"Priest\\" in Dancehall Queen is excellent as the cool and deadly killer who adds a menacingly dark yet complimentary contrast to the mentality of the \\"shottas\\".    Wyclef Jean, formerly of the Fugees plays a small but forgettable role as the Haitian contingency who supports Louie Rankin(Teddy Bruck Shut).   <br /> <br />The violence depicted in this movie is shocking(but not overly gory) in the way the gangsters\ \\"shottas\\" boldly embrace and aggressively execute their way of life with such minimalist concern for human life other than their own brethren.   The plot develops very quickly but there are some gaping holes that make the film seem a bit unrealistic.  The sub titles are helpful because if you are unfamiliar with Jamaican patios the movie will be hard to follow.  However, the sub titles don't include all the dialogue.   In my opinion this is will be a long time cult favorite. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie transcended all other movies in the history of modern film. It beat down \\"The Godfather\\" saga, slapped \\"Star Wars\\" in the face, and it stabbed \\"Titanic\\" in the eye. <br /> <br />Pedro is the classic character of the outsider, and Napoleon, the tragic clown figure. As well as his love interest, who seeks to save Napoleon from the drab existence he is. Uncle Rico trapped in the past longing for another shot. <br /> <br />In short, this movie touched the hearts of many, it certainly helped get over my days of heroin abuse <br />

B000001Y16|5.0|This album is no question one of 2Pac's best and most complete albums front to back.  Not one song on here is filler.  2Pac in my opinion is the greatest overall rapper of all time. <br /> <br />The album starts off with Tupac calling out other rappers (Biggie, Nas, Jay-Z, Mob Deep, etc.) and exposing them as phonies saying that they are fake and should just quit rapping all together.  The next track \\"Hailmary\\" is one of the best songs on the album.  It features the Outlawz which do a decent job rapping and it has a hot beat.  \\"Toss It Up\\" has a tight chorus, good lyrics, some singing in it, and he disses Dr. Dre and Puffy.  \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\" is lyrically the best song on the album and it also has a sweet chorus.  \\"Life As An Outlaw\\" is a good song but the Outlawz kind of ruin it with stupid and unitelligent lyrics but it has a really good chorus.  The next 2 tracks \\"Krazy\\" and \\"Just Like Daddy\\" are songs about getting high and going crazy and doin' girls \\"just like daddy.\\"  \\"White Manz World\\" is a song about living and growing up black in this white mans world.  \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\" you'll probably recognize because Jay-Z stole the chorus for his '03 Bonnie Clyde song off of his Blueprint 2 album.  The next track \\"Hold Ya Head\\" is a slow song saying that no matter what you're going through you got to hold your head up high and keep on going.  The last song \\"Against All Odds\\" is as he puts it \\"the realest s**t he ever wrote.\\"  He disses a couple of rappers and he has a nice flow.  I think it's a great song to finish the album with, it ends with gunshots. <br /> <br />Overall I gave this album a 5/5 because I think album deserves to be up there next to such classics as Nas' Illmatic.  It may only have 12 tracks but they are all almost flawless tracks and the only thing that really holds back the album are the Outlawz.  I would suggest this album to all rap fans, it's definitely worth your money.
B0007NFL1S|5.0|promised an album better then get rich or die tryin, dunno if its as good as get rich but its a damn good album. still gonna easily be the hottest rap cd this year. <br /> <br />outta control, im supposed to die tonite, get in my car, position of power, i dont need em, ryder music, by far best songs, im not a fan of candy shop n disco inferno tho, 15 outta the 22 tracks are fire
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|I am not going to write in-depth review about this album, there already are reviews below with precise description of the album contents. All I want is to express my emotions. The album \\"Sahara\\" took the special place in my heart, and to be honest, I thought, I would never hear \\"Orphaned Land\\" sounding that nice again. How wrong I was. Of course I had had some expectations with new release, but they were beaten, the album was much more stunning than I only could imagine. Within the month I listen to album all day long and it is not enough. It's like a spring that impossible to drain. My favorite songs: Birth of the three, Ocean land, Halo Dies, A call to awake, The storm still rages inside. Everyone who loves intelligent metal and simply beautiful music must listen to \\"Mabool\\". <br /> <br />P.S. It should be written the separate article about bonus disc which contains acoustic live show. The acoustic versions of old songs are just amazing, and tastefully made with huge temperament. The admirers of band will be pleased, and one who listens for the very first time will be enchanted!  <br />
055357342X|2.0|The fact that the story is well written only makes it worse.  The main characters spend the whole book experiencing sorrow and hardship.  None of the characters you come to like ever have anything good happend to them, and most of the end up dead. At least in the first two books some of the characters did well, but in this last book everyone is either dead or locked up.  This makes the book tiresome.  I wish I stopped at book 2, I would be a happier person now if I hadn't read this book! I spend each chapter waiting for the axe to drop on the next character.   This isn't a fantasy book, its a tragedy!!!  Shame on you George RR Martin!
B0007N1AI6|3.0|The \\"BRAVE NEW WORLD\\" (from Iron Maiden)phenomenon repeats itself...Fans awaiting so eagerly for a new release from their favorite line-up gives five stars review and hail the album as if it was the best ever from the band, or compare it to their best classics... With the passing of time, people will see this is not the truth. <br /> <br />At least, contrary to Iron Maiden, Judas still is energized, they still play vigorously
B000069AUI|5.0|This one's gonna be hard to top. Only 2 records in and Coldplay make a career record.  Chris Martin could wake up tomorrow and decide he doesn't want to make music anymore and he'd still be responsible for this masterpiece.    Following up \\"Parachutes\\" was no easy feat, a record that reminded many (myself included) of a slightly more commercial Radiohead and a great record at that.  But this one tops \\"Parachutes\\" artistically and certainly commercially.    Emulating one of the world's greatest bands is one thing, making a record that very nearly trumps them is no easy feat.  The interesting part will be seeing where they go from here.    On an album full of unforgettable songs its hard to pick favorites, but \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\", \\"Clocks, and the title cut are modern day masterpieces.
0064471047|5.0|I'm a third grade teacher in a rural district in New York State.  Each year there are books that are on my `must read to the kids' list and The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is high on that list. <br /> <br />C.S. has done an incredible job in creating a timeless journey to an amazing fantasy land that kids just love!  The struggle between good and evil has prompted many discussions after reading the book.  I'm a fan, and each year the series prompts many of my students to go find the box set.  I think the series is a must read; for kids of all ages. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, but beware there is some violence in the book, but again I think that handled properly even 3rd graders can discuss the perils of Good and Evil. <br /> <br />Find the Series, but please read \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" first the way C.S. Lewis originally intended it to be read.  Here's the order I was taught.  Yes, \\"the old way\\" to read the stories is much better in my opinion. <br /> <br />1. Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe <br />2. Prince Caspian  <br />3. Voyage of the Dawn Treader  <br />4. The Silver Chair <br />5. Horse and His Boy <br />6. Magicians Nephew <br />7. The Last Battle <br />
B0007GAEW6|4.0|The Mars Volta is an unlikely success. Listening to old ATDI, I could scarcely guess that Omar's talent was so multifaceted, or Cedric's voice so potentially enthralling. Frances The Mute continues the impressive tradition that De-Loused started, while veering off in unimaginable and enticing directions. Frances feels much more organic than de-loused. There are only five main tracks, and each track develops and grows in a fashion that seems to defy order to an even greater extent than the De-Loused tracks. What you loved about De-Loused is back, along with what you didn't care for. Omar's guitar maneuverings are delicious on Frances, especially on Cygnus and Cassandra. John Frusciante appears again on Frances and makes a very un-John Frusciante move by providing explosive solos for L'via. The indulgence everyone griped about on De-Loused returns on FTM, this time considerably amplified. There is an extended period of silence on Cassandra, and Miranda is preempted by five minutes of birds chirping (think of the beginning of televators, times five). Also, the lyrics of Frances are as uncomprehensible as those of its predecessor, outlining a dark, proggy plot what one cannot hope to fathom. If you were put off by the indulgences of The Mars Volta on De-Loused, you probably won't like this album. However, like their breakout recording, Frances counterbalances the group's excessive white-noise and uber-complicated lyrics with exceptional musical material. L'via is unbelievably listenable: it veers between tight, rhythmic, super-funk and cool, melodica salsa. Cassandra is epochal: 32 minutes long, pulse quickening the whole way. Cedric beautifully narrates the whole album, often in Spanish (his english may as well be spanish, it's unlikely that anyone will understand it).  Once again, The Mars Volta flatly reject the notion that gifted musicians can't make a rock album that reaches a wide audience. Omar and Cedric's sense of rhythm, experimentation and funk put them at alevel that few other performers could ever hope to touch. Anyone who makes a comparison to Rush and Yes is being small-minded. The artistry that The Mars Volta possess is somehting unparalleled by any other cosmic prog band. They dare to do the unthinkable: make brainy and expansive prog rock, while infusing it with punk, funk and even salsa. If you want to be blown away but not put off, you need to pick up Frances asap. Also, check out the single Frances The Mute, which was released in Europe. You can download it at a handfull of places, it really lends itself to the rest of the album
0425152251|4.0|I was steered to this book a couple of years ago while trapsing around Barnes and Noble.  My daughter's name is Sophie and I have always had an interest in Philosophy, so when I came across this book it immediately drew me in. <br /> <br />As others have indicated, this is a very introductory course in the history of Philosophy which leads you through 3000 years of philosophical development, growth, and evolution, and even provides a healthy overlapping of how Philosophy and Religion have been at times supporters and antagonists of each other.   <br /> <br />What is initially disturbing about this book occurs in the narrative portion where Sophie who is 4 weeks shy of her 15th birthday begins to receive with astonishing regularity correspondence from a much older man who has hand-picked her for this \\"crash course\\" in Philosophy.  There's no set-up as to why this has so abruptly begun, nor are we provided any real sense as to why Sophie would be so swept in into such a mature and profoud interaction with someone she has not met. <br /> <br />Yes, the narrative is weak and serves only to establish the scenes where the philosopher \\"teaches\\" the course at first through clandestine correspondence and then through similarly clandestine meetings with the philosopher.  However, the content within these teachings cannot be disregarded.  The author does a brilliant job at connecting us to the philosophical world, explaining who the key European players were and are and asking several essential philosophical questions for Sophie to consider which in turn compells us to consider them as well. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book very much, overall, but feel that two books of greater enjoyment and punch could have been created had the author separated the course from the separate story of Sophie.  I don't think that one required the other.
B000002WPI|5.0|At a time in which East Coast hip hop was virtually dead, out came a sound noone had ever heard, because in the history of hip hop very few had mixed grimey drum and bass lines and pounding snares. There was virtually noone who could touch the skills of the Wu-Tang Clan. From the first verse of the 36 Chambers you can tell these cats mean business. This is the album that changed my life, opened my eyes, and made me want to become a hip hop MC. And I garentee this record will change the way you feel about hip hop music.<br /><br />1. Bring Da Ruckus-10/10-Classic, from the very first verse in which Ghostface Killah Claims (Ghostface, catch the blast of a hype verse/My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse)this record starts off with tight lyrics and mad, grimey beats. Total destruction of tha mind.<br /><br />2. Shame on a Nigga-10/10-Classic, ODB shows how insane his rhyming is on this track. Considered by many to be some of ODB's best work, many forget that Raekwon and Method Man have some pretty ill, yet overlooked rhymes too.<br /><br />3. Clan In Da Front-8/10-I think GZA is one of the best MC's in the Wu, but I don't really think the beat for this song is that ill, the rhymes are tight but I'm not really feeling tha beat as much, but Its still a slammin track nonethaless.<br /><br />4. Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber-10/10-Classic, Tight beats and ill rhymes frome Inspectah Deck and RZA make this song one of the albums top 5 best.<br /><br />5. Can It Be All So Simple-10/10-Damn I wish I could give this more but I don't want to be a jackass and do the I'm so funny I'm making it over the line stuff. Soulful beats and jazz samples dug underneath Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's smooth yet tortured rhymes make this an instant classic.<br /><br />6. Da Mystery of Chessboxin'-10/10-My favorite song ever by the Wu-Tang, I don't really know what to say besides how awesome the rhymes are. EVERY SINGLE ONE of the verses are spitfire. Pure genious, especially Masta Killa's verse.<br /><br />7. Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing Ta F' Wit-10/10-A really hot song with one of the best opening verses of all hip hop songs by Prince Rakeem. Just awesome, the joint that blew our eardrums.<br /><br />8. C.R.E.A.M.-10/10-The joint that started it all, Cash Rules Everything Around Me...dats all I got ta say.<br /><br />9. Method Man-10/10-One of the tightest tracks ever, this jam proves that Tical was one of the strongest MC's in tha Wu-Tang, from start to finish this a true party jam that is way underratted.<br /><br />10. Protect Ya Neck-10/10-It is one of the best Wu songs out there, plain and simple...From Inspectah Deck's ledgendary first verse to Tha GZA's closing statements this is one of the illest songs on the album.<br /><br />11. Tearz-10/10-It may be slow and soulful but it is really damn good, the lyrics for this song are so heartfelt you can feel RZA's pain as he holds his brothers dead body...Just a beautiful song.<br /><br />12.

B00007KWHN|5.0|With the advent of Steve Howe on guitar, Yes would begin the tranisition of a semi-psychedellic semi-folk band to a progressive rock band.  To be fair to original guitarist Peter Banks, he was a competent rhythm guitarist (his best moment is perhaps \\"Astral Traveller\\") but Howe's more versatile playing would force rings around Banks'.  This would also be keyboardist Tony Kaye's last album until 90125 (he was a great organist but lacked the technological knowhow that future keyboardists like Rick Wakeman, Patrick Moraz, Geoff Downes and Igor Khoroshev would possess).  The opener \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" opens with a bold introduction, the 1st verse does not appear until nearly 2 minutes into the song.  Howe plays different parts on different guitars and bassist Chris Squire plays bass almost like a 6-string guitar (his early influnences of Paul McCartney and John Entwistle would show up here).  Also, Jon Anderson would show more growth as a singer.  Tony Kaye's contributions on organ also fit in well (he uses a moog synthesizer at the end of the song).  Following is Steve Howe's acoustic guitar piece called \\"Clap.\\"  For many years, this song was pressed onto LP and CD as \\"The Clap,\\" much to the chagrin and resentment of Howe (I can just picture reviews \\"Get The Clap and many others on The Yes Album!\\").  Folk and blues are blended quite well here (there also exists a studio version of this song on this CD).  Following that is Yes' masterpiece \\"Starship Trooper,\\" which would feature Yes' signature key and tempo changes and Jon Anderson's semi-vague, sci-fi lyrics featured in the \\"Life Seeker\\" segment (\\"Speak to me of summer, long winters longer than time can remember,\\" \\"starship trooper, go sailing on by,\\" and \\"what I don't know, I have never heard\\" are examples).  Chris Squire also proved to be a great harmonist, you can hear him singing along with Anderson on the \\"Disillusion\\" segment.  Finally, Howe ends with a catchy riff played over and over again on the \\"Wurm\\" segment (I don't know if this influenced Lynyrd Skynyrd but their closing jam on \\"Free Bird\\" is reminiscent of this).  \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" became one of Yes' 1st \\"hits.\\"  The opening segment \\"Your Move\\" talks about a chess game \\"Move me onto any black square... don't surround yourself with yourself.\\"  There is also mention of several John Lennon/Beatles references \\"All we are saying is give peace a chance\\" and \\"send an instant kharma to me.\\"  The 2nd part features a catchy bass line by Squire and the line \\"I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way.\\"  The song closes with the chorus sung 2 keys lower each time (One disk jockey confesses that once while playing \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" on the radio, he turned off the phonograph at the fadeout of that song and the station manager reprimanded him!).  \\"A Venture\\" sounds like an outtake from earlier albums, it was the only song not featured in live performances.  \\"Peretual Change\\" is the last song on the original album.  The live version would give Bill Bruford an outlet for a drum solo.  Also included on this release are single versions of \\"Starship Trooper (Life Seeker)\\" and \\"Your Move.\\"  This album would point the direction where Yes was heading on future albums.
B00064AM6C|3.0|I agree with all the people praising the raw energy and emotion of this show. The performance of \\"Jolene\\" (a great song from Dolly Parton which shows country doesn't always suck) is manic. <br /> <br />However, let's not get carried away with calling Jack a great guitar player or Meg a great drummer. Having taught guitar (and played in Jazz/Funk bands) for 35 years Jack White is a terrible guitar player technically. It works for The White Stripes and gives them a raw edge but it's not musicianship. When you miss as many notes as Jack does, and you can count them by the dozens on this DVD, then it may be energetic/raw but it isn't good. Similarly, Meg doesn't as much drum as tap occasionally, Meg wont be confused with Gene Krupa or Neil Peart anytime soon. <br /> <br />Great music from poor musicians.
6305882592|5.0|This movie is briliant.  It's a sweet love story, mixed with dark/bizarre humor and some meaningful socio-political messages. The soundtrack is fantastic and works perfectly with the film.  This movie is my official screening device for future friends.  I know many kind and wonderful people who could not appreciate this film, and god bless 'em.  But if I want to know right away if there's at least a possibility of someone \\"getting\\" me or a deeper connection between myself and them, I ask them if they like this movie. If they haven't seen it, I lend it to them.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I know that the internet has given a voice to the faceless millions, but do we have to hear from each and every one of them!! I am so happy to have Halford back in Priest - Why do we need to hear from the \\" Critics\\". Who cares what you think. <br />Get off your butt and do something with your life. Judas Priest are Metal Gods. Shut up and listen to the CD or go back listening to Linkin Park.
B0002HMQUS|5.0|A little heavy for what it is desinged for, but that's because it is built like a tank.  Compared to other similar items, it may be 2x the price but it is 10x the quality.   <br /> <br />I bought this for several small cameras that I take out for family outings.  It is probably overkill for my small digital camera, but it keeps the camera still which helps prevent blurry pictures. <br /> <br />It retracts to a relatively compact size and has a padded grip area with a wrist strap.  The head attaches easily and the controls operate smoothly.  This is definitely a quality piece of equiment and Bogen seems to have one of the best reputations of camera support manufacturers.  <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Verry much what Auchtung Baby is to Joshua tree this album is to 2000s All that you can't leave behind. Much more guitar driven and in general a rocking album. <br />
0385510454|1.0|I've never read Grisham (don't like courtroom stories) and after wading through this I'm done. It's a thin, predictable plot that is cluttered with endless lessons in Italian grammar and an almost Michelin-style guide to Bologna.  Take those two out and you have a short story, not a novel.   <br /> <br />Also why bring in a would be assasin in the last 20 pages that is never mentioned again?
