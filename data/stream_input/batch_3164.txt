B000O77SOK|5.0|Very Sad this Ends. Why they didn't release DVD's for all the season. Sad to leave Bobby Excellent.They should release  DVD for all the seasons with subtitles and HD.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this all the time. Some levels are tough but what would be the point if all the levels are easy.
B0053TMP24|5.0|So awsome! Right when you get bored with a character rick switches it up. I still like percy best but frank and hazel are great too! Get ready for an quest from never before!
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I've been a fan of this dev's physics game for a while. Very well designed and not too technical to learn. Even my 7 year old is a fan now...Simple Rockets is on all of our mobile devices.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|This season was sorely lacking in any resemblance to previous seasons. From the first episode of season one I was addicted to Dexter and couldnt wait for the next season to be available on dvd. However I would call the final season &#34;Dexter Lite&#34;. It was very disappointing, with a weak story line that rarely resembled the first 7 seasons. If the first season had been of this low quality and boring ho hum unexcitement factor I wouldnt have bothered watching any other seasons. I wish I had stopped at the end of season 7 because this ending pretty much ruined the rest of the series for me. How could they not come up with something that would make this show go out with a bang instead of a whimper. Dont waste your money and time on season eight.....I actually couldnt wait for most of the episodes to end so I could go to bed. Bummer.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It works everytime without an issue, it is there when I need it, and works like a charm.  No issues.
B00138J9HI|5.0|This is one of Judas Priest's top 3 albums.  If you are a Priest fan, this MUST be in your collection.  I would argue that this album's versions of some of their songs are better than the original &#34;studio&#34; versions.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It is okay, I have given it this because sometimes it takes my password and sometimes it doesn't if I didn't know better I would think it that disease the elderly always talk about &#34;SOMETIMERS DISEASE; sometimes I remember somertimes I don't&#34;.  Yes, I know a computer nor a Kindle can not have such a thing but when I know I am putting in the correct password, something is going on.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I WAS INTERESTED IN THIS BOOK AS I SAW THE MOVIE. THE PLACES LIZ VISITED AND THE PEOPLE SHE MET WERE FASCINATING.  I ENJOY READING ABOUT LOVE.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best app ever created, also I could play it for hours and not even know that I have been playing that long. And it is very addicitive
B00G21YLF6|5.0|One of the best episodes I've ever seen.  Not just from this show, but any show out there.  It was so satisfying!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I think Katniss is an idiot sometime. As well as selfish in her actions to help someone. It's weird how that works. But than she was raised naive to a degree. She just made me angry sometimes. While at the same time, she is loveable.
1250030951|5.0|Terrific story about a college freshman who is a fan of Simon Snow. Cath and her sister Wren have lived for their idol Simon Snow for a few years now and now with college, the two sisters are attending the same college but splitting up too. Wren no longer wants to live for their favorite star Simon Snow, nor does she want Cath to be her roommate but Cath doesn't want to let go. With things changing all around her including her relationship with her sister, Cath can't help but go places she doesn't necessarily want to go. A wonderful book about becoming an adult and the changing life of adulthood. One of the best teen books of 2013 and quite an achievement!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not The Dark Knight and it doesn't try to be. It's able to remain fun without being dumb. I enjoyed Thor more than the most of the other Marvel flicks.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|Good looking homage to the Rolex Daytona.  The watch is sturdy and the textured dial looks nice.  There are a couple of drawbacks, though:<br /><br />-  The chronograph buttons aren't really useful.  You have to unscrew the buttons to use them, which makes them unusable if you need them quickly.<br />-  The case is quite thick and sits high on the wrist.  For a 40mm watch I would have liked it to be a little thinner.<br />-  It has the word &#34;Invicta&#34; stamped on the side of the case.  That's a little obnoxious.<br />-  The crystal is only mineral crystal (i.e., glass).  Really would have preferred Invicta's Flame Fusion crystal which holds up better.  I already have a few minor scratches on the crystal after relatively light usage.<br />-  Making this watch an automatic by using the Seiko NH35A movement like in the Invicta 8926 Submariner homage would have made this a much nicer watch.<br /><br />Not a bad watch.  There aren't a lot of Rolex Daytona homages out there, so his watch gives you the look if that's what you're after.  But Invicta could have made a MUCH nicer watch here with just a few adjustments.  An automatic movement and flame fusion crystal could have really done a lot for this watch.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Good solid story that catches you right away and holds you til the end. We'll written. Really enjoyed it. Really makes you think about lives of foster children.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie can be watched again and again. That's why I wanted it for myself. Love the story and studied the book in my schooldays back in Holland in 1953. Very impressive acting.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I actually use it for debugging purposes...works really well. If you are doing development with an accessory, this will help.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Too easy for children to access and purchase unwanted items.  My Amazon account keeps my logged in and makes it too easy for the kids to click on things they should not.  Had to delete it.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Wonderful, clever well-written film full of adventure and romance - and a joy to watch, repeatedly. The soundtrack is excellent, and the acting, by both those you know and those you don't, superb
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a good exercise for the brain.<br />It could use some clearer instructions on how to play, though, for beginners like me!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Had to check out this game everyone keeps talking about, and now I can't stop playing. The graphics are cute, music upbeat, and candy crushing is just too much fun! The variety of each level, and how the difficulty increases keeps you hooked.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The picture is better than expected on the streaming website and the digital copy downloaded to my computer without a problem.  It's about time they started including everything when you purchase the movie.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|blood splatter is a bit over the top but its a cool game. fun to play. controls are good and weapons are neat.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read a lot of reviews before ordering this book for my Kindle.  Initially, I didn't want to read it because half of the reviewers hated it.  They complained about the way it ends.  Having strongly disliked the end of Defending Jacob, I was guarded about this one.  I liked this book, however.  I don't know of any other way Flynn could have ended it satisfactorily.  I didn't predict the end (as I usually do) and felt it suited the characters.<br /><br />One thing that caused me to be unwilling to suspend disbelief was the interaction  between the wife and the couple she met at the motel.  No way would this woman let her guard down like that.  I just couldn't buy that part of the story.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I didn't laugh, but I didn't cry. It was nice reading about the business vs creative side of my favorite shoes.
B00G9U7NEQ|1.0|I ordered this in HD but the quality was very bad.  the screen froze multiple times and looked &#34;low res&#34; and glitchy.
B00G21XNKU|3.0|I LOVE Doctor Who and some moments were wonderful. However, the choice of alien made most of it laughable! Not scary at all and given the weight the war has always seemed to evoke it would have made more sense to have the Daleks in this movie!! John Hurt was fantastic and his scenes alone were worth watching the movie for. Smith and Tennant were a bit clownish and that again seemed strange considering how serious the subject matter of the war has been treated in the past.  All that being said it was enjoyable...I would highly recommend the Mark Gatiss treatment of the beginning of Doctor Who. I think it is called Adventures in Space and Time!!
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|the movie was really good lots of action and I think Jamie Foxx is a good actor as well as Channing Tatum

B008JFUPOY|5.0|Of all the movies I've ever seen about monsters going to school, this has BY FAR been the most recent.  And notice the Eye in the middle of the &#34;M&#34; on the title.  That HAS to count for something.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app was the only reason why I liked kindle fire. I am in the 8th grade and do not have a phone, kik was the only way for me to contact my friends. I moved schools recently so kik was what I used to stay in touch with my old friends. Now I don't have any contact with my friends from my old school which SUCKS. I just really want kik back...
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This was a good movie, It was entertaining and a good storyline. Good ending. Plenty of twists that kept you guessing.

B000AAF1U4|5.0|Super funny. Got movie very quickly during a Christmas time rush. I highly recommend getting this movie for your kids.
B001NU124O|5.0|This is my second favorite Styx's album.  I like every song.  The title track is the best song on the album.
B0059WTMLW|2.0|This has been my go-to sudoku app for months. I liked the free one so much I even paid for this one.<br /><br />I don't need to list all the features I like, it's got a ton of them. The appearance settings, the variety of puzzles, the hint system, all great.<br /><br />But! This latest release is making me look for other apps! All due to a small simple oversight.<br /><br />I like to time my games, but I frequently watch tv while playing. When I focus on the tv I pause the game.<br /><br />The pause button is now gone. Why? This makes timing the game pointless. I know ultimately this means nothing, but still it was so easy to hit the button quickly when needed, now it's in the menu.....<br /><br />Put it back, please?
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|Was sent to South Africa the series with the wrong regional code so could only watch it on my PC
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Frustrating when it cuts you off and says you have no more moves when there are more moves visible. Don't like having to wait for someone to give you a life so you can play or you charge in order to allow further play. Waited a long time and so farms disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Better than most games I`'ve ever played,I would recommend you guys play this game because if you Don`t you,will,cry!!! And so you know,if you Don`t Chet this game like I said, YOU WILL CRY!!!!!!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wow ending that I was not expecting.  I liked the return to characters from previous works.  Although it has been said before, it was hard to put down.  A truly great read.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Absolutely interesting to read. I could not turn off my ipad until the end of the book. A story about a very famous Navy Seal Sniper who died recently helping another soldier to readapt to civil life and killed by the same sickened soldier. Strongly recommended.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Awesome game. Loved it on FB, love it here. Just wish I had more friends playing but other than that it's great. Beautiful graphics.
B0000009RT|5.0|Frank was one of the original &#34;Rappers&#34; of sorts and in the previous reviews I saw no mention of &#34;Trouble coming every day&#34; which it has and does since the beginning of time. This was a time when Journalism was just being fed a certain amount of facts, and a lot of naive  people across America were shocked about things they heard on the daily news or in the paper. Seems like all the news media of that time or the &#34;Paparazzi&#34; of Europe wanted a article which they could retire on. Listen and learn and definitely turn up the volume on Trouble everyday, You will definitely look up a &#34;Brownie camera&#34; (I have owned one) and ma-bee you too will eventually Play your harmonica Son!!!!!  Freak OUT

B009LDD5E0|5.0|Honestly, this isn't the best season, but it's definitely not horrible. I love the music choices made in this season for sure. The music was probably my absolute favorite part of this season, but the story lines just kind of seemed eh over on the McKinley side.<br /><br />I adored the New York story lines, especially after Santana moved in with Kurt & Rachel. They were the absolute best group of the season, and the 4th season definitely helped me like Rachel a little more (not that I ever hated the character, the 3 seasons before just had her played out to be a needy girl who always needed a man to be happy).<br /><br />This season had a lot of Blaine, which would have been totally fine with me if it had not gotten in the way of some of the other story lines. I love Kurt/Blaine and I adore Kurt- but Blaine by himself is just kind of, well, bland. Darren Criss is an amazing actor but the story lines with him always revolved around his need to have center stage & to be with Kurt, which can get tiring very quickly.<br /><br />Since I've always adored to Santana/Brittany relationship and it had been awhile since I had seen Brittany with a male character, the whole Brittany/Sam thing took me quite off guard. It's not the worst couple in the show's history by far (*cough* Santana/David *cough*) but to me it just seemed almost unnecessary. There really was no need for them to be together in order for the story lines to make sense. Also, the whole marriage thing left a bitter taste in my mouth, even though it wasn't official. In my opinion, Brittany/Sam together brought both of their I.Q. levels down about 30 points, and that's scary to think about especially since Brittany's I.Q. could not have been too high in the first place.<br /><br />Overall, season 4 excelled musically, excelled on the New York side, and was okay on the McKinley side.
B00868AF9O|5.0|My favorite book of all time! You won't be disappointed! I laughed ,I cried , my bet is you will too! Animal lovers everywhere will want to read this story over and over!

B00G21YLF6|1.0|I found out that Amazon hiked the price from the normal $2.99 all the way up to $6.99. Without any explanation, it just looks like blatant gouging. Its the only time I bought an episode of anything on Amazon, and I will never do it again.
B003XRELEI|5.0|&#34;Breakfast of Champions&#34; was my first Vonnegut novel way back in college. It was quirky and funny and tragic and I loved it. It set me off to ready just about everything he wrote. To be honest, I have now forgotten much of the general story in the book (which is why I acquired this copy), but I have never forgotten completely about Kilgore Trout and his joke about mirrors. I am prone to say to my wife, &#34;Excuse me while I go and steal a mirror.&#34; From this book I also learned the expression, &#34;And so on...&#34;. I use it often in my own writing. With Mr. Vonnegut now gone, it is a little late to say, but...God Bless You, Mr. Vonnegut...wherever you are.
B00F3OLVR4|5.0|I am divided whether to give this album a 4 or 5 star rating. This album is a great album, but I don't think it's perfect. I think it's a great album and what fans have been looking for from them since the early 90's. This album is like a cross between and justice for all and the black album. It has a lot of really solid songs, guitar riffs and solo's. My favorite song on here is All Nightmare Long. I think the album ends better than it begins, but overall a very nice release by Metallica and it showed that they put in a lot of work on this one.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie has great visuals; limited story line and character development; probably as good as a movie translation could be.

B000XUBFE2|4.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a character-driven, thought-provoking story examining WWII and the Holocaust from a different perspective, but one just as devastating. There were so many good and decent people, Jewish, German, etc., who suffered because they were forced to live under Hitler's barbaric, violent, inhumane regime.<br /><br />There were  acts of defiance, and many were in no position to offer such heroism, but did so anyway, refusing to hang the Nazi flag or hiding Jews within their homes. There were people who couldn't stand to watch the suffering of their fellow man and even a compassionate offer of stale bread to emaciated, concentration prisoners paraded through the streets rewarded them with severe beatings, whippings, and often community ostracism. Paranoia was rampant; trust was absent, and fear was everywhere.<br /><br />Liesel, Hans, Rosa, Rudy, and a supporting cast of other memorable characters will make you feel so many things, but it is \\"Death\\" that narrates and takes center stage in this story. The author brilliantly alters the reader's perception of death; this character is a gentle worker with a job to do, to carry the souls of the dead to their rightful resting place. \\"Death\\" is sorrowful, overburdened, disgusted and exhausted by man's inhumanity to man especially during this shameful period of history. It is his story of seeing and experiencing intolerable suffering and his encounters with the Book Thief that reach out and capture the reader's heart.<br /><br />I have to tell you that I fell in love with Hans, Liesel's foster father. He was patient, kind and loving. He touched so many lives in this book and changed them for the better, and I do believe that he changed mine for the better as well. To find such quality, tenderness, and genuineness in a man who was suffering himself, from poverty and enduring the atrocities of War, made him all the more special to me. He had an open heart and an open mind, and he cared about what was right, and in the ways that he could, stood up for his beliefs.<br /><br />Why the 4 star review you might ask? Although \\"Death\\" narrating the story was effective on many levels, it was also confusing at times. The chapter headings were distracting as well. It almost read as a play, but it wasn't. If given the option I would have rated this novel with 4 1/2 stars. Be warned, the subject-matter is heavy and emotional, but not to be missed.
B00FB029IU|4.0|United Kingdom wonderkid Jake Bugg makes his return to the jukebox with Shangri La . At only 19 years old Jake has an excellent future ahead of him as well as an already respectable past. Last year Bugg released his self titled album amidst meritorious acclaim. The album would reach number one across the pond and this would help establish a modest following for Jake here in the states. One such listener was Rick Rubin, who paired with Jake to produce this sophomore effort,  Shangri La.<br /><br />Jake Bugg articles come with many a Bob Dylan reference and while I'm quite hesitant to give any 19 year old that kind of accolade I will tell you that his voice and music hearkens to those of the 60s and 70s and his vocals very distinctly remind me of Buddy Holly. Jake has big shoes to fill with many critics calling him next in line as far as 21st century British invasion goes. Fans of Oasis, Nick Drake, Donovan, and others will feel strangely at home with Bugg's soulful, fun guitar ditties and frighteningly acute lyrics (so much so of the latter that I question if they are all his). Passed judgment aside  Shangri La gets started on the right footwith \\"There's a Beast and We All Feed It,\\" an upbeat reminder of all things that are a facade concerning society. \\"Slumville Sunrise,\\" the first single is a very Johnny Cash/Hank Williams esque track that revolves around racing layered guitars. Highly enjoyable. \\"Me and You,\\" slows it down and the harmonic finger picking during the latter half of the track is a welcome addition. \\"Messed Up Kids\\" is a beautiful and tragic track about a group of friends we all surely had, \\"beautiful girls with eyes so dark within their sockets,\\" was the line that had me wondering about past acquaintances. Slow burners like \\"Simple Pleasures\\" and \\"A Song About Love\\" might turn off some but it's a dynamic I'm slowly growing fond of. Bugg's innate ability to combine relative genres doesn't sound strained or forced and although the lyrical content is level enough for everyone to relate to it isn't full of FM radio cheese. \\"Kitchen Table\\" and \\"Pine Trees\\" trade the electronic for acoustic and lend ethos to the calling of Bugg as a Nottingham Jack-of-all trades.<br /><br />Jake Bugg has a promising career and this is indeed another \\"plus\\" on what I'm hoping to call a lengthy discography in ten or so years. If one main avenue of criticism exists of Shangri La  it's that if you're expecting a certain shade of Bugg just know that you're getting a sample platter instead, albeit a rather tasty one.

B009ZQFSRA|4.0|Some cheap CGI hurts the movie but other than that, one of the best dystopian/action flicks I've seen! Christian Bale performs well even in &#34;action&#34; sequences. Still hate &#34;that guy from Braveheart&#34; with a passion! LOL Good film, even on repeated watches!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Incredible little device. There hasn't been something this amazing released in the consumer electronics space in years. You're looking at the cheapest major upgrade you can make to your home entertainment center available.<br /><br />You can stream any tab from Chrome on your desktop (including with HD video). You can have hours of fun with multiple friends on Youtube...everybody just queues up a video to watch one after another. Netflix streaming is awesome, although you lose the &#34;playing next episode&#34; feature on Chromecast.<br /><br />If you have a computer and an entertainment center, you need this little device.
B005HSL626|3.0|It was okay, I became bored with it quickly. Once I passed all the objectives, I lost interest. But thats just me.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|So far, I'm pretty unimpressed.  The connection keeps dropping or lags.  Other items like my Smart DVD work well in the same area. I use the power cord, but not really thrilled, yet.  It does stream my desktop and other videos as advertised, just not performing smoothly.
0789325772|4.0|YES love this!! If you like older books, then you will love this!  If you are looking for a super colorful book that has lots of action, maybe you won't enjoy this as much.  I love the simplicity of it and it describes what it's like.  I've never been to London, so I'm hoping it's accurate.  I have to admit, that I loved the cover and that's what drew me to buying it. :)

B005SFR7YE|3.0|This is very good for someone who has a love for the Phantom, I am spoiled with Michael Crawford and was disappointed he did not even sing at the end. Even though those that did were amazing.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik keeps freezing when I log in and will not even let me text my friends. I hate this app it's worthless and it is very unreasonable
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much it is so fun I would not think that I would love minions so much !!!!get it now!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is one of the best apps i have ever downloaded it is fun entertaining and kid safe that is why i would rate 5/5 stars
B006LXQID8|5.0|It was weird but a great movie. It wasn't a rolling on the floor laughing movie, it was more of an awkward situation comedy
B001AGXEAG|4.0|Always thought this movie was really funny! My favorite part is when the ghosts control the unwanted guests bodies, and they sing and dance to the tune of &#34;Daylight Come and me wanna go home&#34;. If you're in the mood for laughs, and a bit of a scare, you chose the right movie!
0425252868|5.0|An amazing story, beautifully written about the men and women in the U. S. and in Germany who actually fought and sacrificed so much in World War II.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I chose this rating, because I hate waiting on more lives. That needs to be eliminated from the entire game.
B005NFVZTM|2.0|X-Men First class is way to preachy and not enough fun. Doesn't come even close to most of the other Marvel movies like Thor or the Avengers. If you don't mind the heavy handed PC preaching you may find it enjoyable. Me I found it boring.
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|I was skeptical if I was going to like this cd because it is early Streisand that moves me the most.However this turned out to be a charming and enjoyable cd with renditions oh her hits as well as new standards that she sings with feeling and nuance.No you cannot compare the upstart with the mature woman,and now I find I enjoy them both for different reasons. Her tribute to Marvin Hamlisch and Julie Stein were particularly poignant. The hefty ticket prices kept me at bay-but this cd is a nice second prize.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I didn't see this in the theater and waited till now to see it. It was better than I expected and much better than Superman Returns. That said I still had a problem with the dark tone but I'm hopeful that the franchise can still go up, up and away.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is exactly what it says it is and it works great. I need this so much. It was my first app that I looked for and I'm so pleased to find it for free.
B00GIZO674|5.0|Great game, tried the free version, immediately purchased the full version. Gets harder as you complete each level. Loads of fun!
0761172726|5.0|This calendar has a space for each family member so I can keep track of more than one schedule on one calendar.  This is the sixth year in a row that I have ordered this calendar and will continue to do so in the years to come.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love all of Grisham's books. The style has changed over the years -- which just makes it more exciting when you begin to read. However, this latest seems to harken back to an original Grisham. It is a sequel that can easily be read alone. The characters are entertaining and you get lost in the story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun when  there isn't anything good on tv at night. Nice sounds also.This would be fun for kids.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|A very moving, compelling and powerfully written book.  It challenged me to think about my eating, and I am still processing what I think.
0812550706|5.0|This book is the greatest one ever written.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|This is a good movie. Gibson did a good job portraying Colonel Moore. It is one of the best movies of Vietnam war.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A good read for younger readers, which I am not but I enjoyed it. Interesting prospective which becomes more evident the further in you get.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is super fun. But their are too many adds. I especially love the mini games that r on it
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Awesome movie. I enjoyed how Snyder followed the tone of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Cavill plays the perfect superman - he seems grounded and doesn't over dramatize the character. Looking forward to Batman vs Superman now!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game and think it is a fun adventurous game I play it every day and recommend this game for you to play!!!!!!!
B008JFUPOY|5.0|We love this series and bought it for our collection. Have them on hand for the grand kids, they love this genre of videos.
0399230033|5.0|One of my toddler´s favorite books.<br />Very good going to bed book.<br />The pictures are cute, story simple and enjoyable.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|The Croods is a very nice movie for the whole family. It comes with the character Belt who my granddaughter loves.
B005VOXPAM|5.0|Loved it!<br />We had already bought the female a few months ago.<br />Our baby is thrilled to have them both.<br />Schleich toys look just like the real thing.
B001FA0NOM|4.0|Game theory thoroughly and (almost always) plainly exposed. I read it combined with the previous edition \\"Think strategically\\" which is in a way more effective, though not covering a couple of subjects, in particular VIckrey's auctions, that the new version brilliantly clarifies. A must-read for non experts provided that you don't pay too much attention to the deceptive subtitle: this book won't give you insights on how to solve real life issues, rather some general reasoning patterns that will come in handy in your everyday activity.
0679890475|5.0|My baby loves reading this book and doing all the animal sounds. I like the very small format, very light also, easy to take in your diaper bag for emergency reading (like at the doctor´s office).
0385333846|5.0|Do we really have freewill?  What is time?  Why me?  This is a brilliant story about a man obviously suffering after seeing Dresden fire-bombed in World War II.  The protagonist is a fatalist in every sense and traveling through his life, in his shoes, is an interesting journey.  I highly recommend reading this book.
B009CVRQLY|2.0|... if this album has any success.  After listening to the cd twice there is not one song that I would like to listen to over and over.  Listen to the clips of the tracks and you'll see there are no catchy melodies.  I own almost every Celine cd and this one is very disappointing.
B00GIZO674|5.0|Great game get it I love it<br />Once I started I couldn't put it down I give it five stars.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This is a good game, however, I can't rate this game as great because of the expense to purchase items to successfully complete the more difficult levels. The game should allow players to use the coins earned to purchase the current for-pay tools. I have over 500,000 coins and can't use them to purchase extra balls, etc. After this level I may not play anymore because I can't afford to.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|If you like these type of hidden object games, you'll like this one. My kids really enjoy it. I like it fine ans the story line is interesting.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|For the longest time, this app worked fine. Today, I tried to log in and everytime I entered my password and pressed &quot;log in,&quot; a little notice would pop up on the screen saying &quot; You need to log in first.&quot;<br /><br />So basically, I need to log in to my facebook before I'm allowed to log in to my facebook.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Mildly addicting but an excellent brain game. I love keeping my mind active and alert. I recommend this to everyone.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is a dynamic sequel to A Time to Kill.  John Grisham has once again outdone himself with  a riveting novel.
B0081336FO|5.0|I've been a Conan Doyle and Holmes fan since the 50's.<br />This is a finely crafted series, as Watson might have written it.
B007HJ9NBE|3.0|Good message. Felt kind of rushed to reach the climax. Overall decent movie. Not as good as the original movie.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|Its a really cool concept! Its so fun but it gets so hard, so only four stars because I'm stuck!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|good but please fix the bug that makes it so that it exits to home menu every time it loads!Btw it is still a good game.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This book was tough to read because Reacher takes a painful hit and it takes your breath away by how vicious the hit is. Luckily he has a team this time to help because no one messes with special investigators! U go Reacher!
B005K17RU0|1.0|This is a bad app. It tells you nothing of the weather. had a Kindle Fire HD and loved Weather Bug. Got a new HDX and Weather Bug is not listed as a weather app. Funny thing is I bought my wifea new HD and she can have Weather Bug. I now use my Iphone to look at weather. You guessed it I can get Weather Bug. Don't use your Kindle Fire HDX for weather updates.<br />'
B009A3NGF4|4.0|Not as good as Sigh No More but still good. It is always tough for a group to live up to the hype of their best album. Good effort
B00008BXJJ|5.0|I saw them in Nashville during the Back In Black tour so decided this CD would come close. It sounds as if it was made in a studio, it's that good! I lost my hearing twice that year - with AC/DC and Ted Nugent.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|Bag is sturdy, stitching is fantastic, overall it holds everything my camera needs. The best part is when the camera was purchased the bag was free.
B00G32OMF8|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie. As a couple of two young children as we are, we sympathize with the difficulties of finding space for us, as a couple, within a busy daily life as parents. This is a long-dialogue movie, not much action, but still entertaining. It gave my husband and I something to talk about afterwards.
B00AO3K01C|4.0|Ruth discovers a package washed up on the shore near her Canadian island home. Inside she finds the diary of Nao, a teenage girl in Tokyo, as well as various other memorabilia relating to her. Ruth, who is a writer, finds herself sucked into Nao's world, becoming the reader and editor of the diary (and later even believes she has become part of the story). The events of both women seem to run concurrent to each other, despite being separated by time and place.<br />Other characters in this intriguing tale of how we interpret the world and people and stories include Jiko (Nao's zen Buddhist monk great-grandmother), Haruki #1 (Jiko's kamikaze pilot philosopher son), Haruki #2 (Nao's suicidal engineer father) and Oliver (Ruth's artistic and scientific husband). These characters affect and ultimately shape Nao and Ruth as their stories unfold.<br />Ruth's sections are told as a narrative, in the third person, while Nao's are written as a diary, in the first. Ruth's life is fairly ordinary, rural and mundane, while Nao's is turbulent and urban (except for her only period of peace with Jiko at her temple in the mountains). Nao writes to her reader, as one would to a friend, and Ruth accepts this role eagerly, even though the fate of this new &#34;friend&#34; from another time and place may never be known. A great read.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This game is absolutely perfect! I have played all of alawar, big fish, G5 games, and this is truly one of the best so far (best part is that I am still not through the first scene!  Download time in my opinion is well worth the wait (about 8 minutes or so to download. Keep email coming, great job!!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|It would be an awesome game if the tilt control worked with Nabi!! So disappointed!!! Please fix this!! It works great on my iphone and kindle.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|Suspiria ranks in the top 10 for the scariest and best horror films of all time. Dario Argento has yet to top the success of this film. The atmosphere of bizarre neon lighting, luxurious architecture and set design provides this film with a beautiful backdrop for brutal and unpredictable violence. The violent murders are artistically done like a painter splashing red stuff on a canvas. The score by Goblin is very memorable and increases the creep and fear factor to an un-measurable amount. The film provides the audience with an uneasy and unsafe ambiance throughout. This is not a stalk and slash film. There is no safety of recognizing trends from an over used formula like your average slasher movie. There is no formula. Watch this film and you will be stuck in a nightmare for over two hours. You may never sleep again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is a great game.I would recommend it for any kid that would want it.I give this game 5 stars because it's a great game. I think everyone should have it.any one who has a tablet or a phone or iPod should have or get subway surfers.it a very very very good game.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I grew up on the batman, superman, and justice league animated series in the early 90's to 2000 and have been waiting for years to see the characters given the respect they deserve and this movie DID NOT disappoint one bit. there are script issues but overall i thoroughly enjoyed every minute. cant wait for the sequel
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Seen the movies then read the book...omg book is so much better!!!!  They definitely let out some good scenes that happened in the book out of the movie... especially the endng
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|I came into it with low expectations, it did not meet even those expectations. Should have taken the advice of my friends.
630233683X|5.0|Could be the best musical ever made.  Personally, I think Donald O'Connor is a better dancer than Gene Kelly.  In my opinion, Jean Hagen, as Lina Lamont, stole the picture.  What a great accent she was able to pull off thru the entire picture.
B002P3RCVU|5.0|Excellent! Timing, packaging, and product was perfect! I put together an anniversary gift for my husband and this addition was the last piece!
B008M721MS|1.0|I read online trying to find an app to download it suggested this but it doesnt work on a Kindle Fire
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Absolutely loved this book.  The humour is bizarre, over the top, and exactly the way I like it.  Well done and I would highly recommend it!<br /><br />Anisa A. Claire<br />Writer's Carnival<br />www.writerscarnival.ca
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a fun game.  It is easy for a Sr. citizen to play and it is good clean fun.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It took me quite a bit of time to get through. I am not a huge fan of fiction  so in the beginning I was a little bored but once the quell was announced I was hooked.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Did exactly what we needed it to do.  Scoring is pretty easy but I would follow the directions as followed.  Was  not made out of the best metal but worked well anyway.
1452110581|5.0|I got this copy as a gift.  There is only one word to describe it - funny.  Funny, funny, funny.  These are significantly devious creatures writing this poetry.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|like this app. starting from my android smartphome installed it on kindle and I'm still very setisfed. thanks for making it free
B00129XQ2W|4.0|Although the performance is wonderful, the recording is overly bright.  Being a recording teacher I edited the sound files to bring the mid-range out and to boost the bass before I can actually listen to the recording.  It is very apparent that this may be a 'pirated' version of the 1951 concert as I hear multiple sound attenuation throughout the recording.<br /><br />It is my hope that those who wish to purchase this recording to be aware of the bright sound  and the imperfection of the recording.  It still remains my favorite performance of this work.  I will still hold on to my vinyl and my CD version from EMI.<br /><br />The humanity exhibited by this recording is only rivaled by the 1954 recording.  The 1942 recording was too intense for me.<br /><br />Thank you for allowing me space to speak.<br /><br />Ian
B00G21XNKU|4.0|Was a way for the Doctor to undo his biggest regret! But my favorite Doctor, Tennant, seemed a little off...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|the book was intriguing the plot fascinating..I typically don't read this type of book but all the hype got me interested
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I play that more than anything --I even play it on my computer -- I like the challenge!!<br />I find the &#34;characters&#34; used on the pieces very interesting.
B00B7FOQCK|2.0|I wasn't a fan of this.  I had this on my wish list for a while based on the positive reviews, but it turned out to be a disappointment.  The major reason is that the USB ports were extremely tight, and I felt like I was going to break my USB devices and cables when I plugged them in. I'm not sure whether I just got a bad unit, or whether they are all like this.  I'm guessing it is more likely that I just got a bad unit given the other positive reviews.<br /><br />Also worth noting, as it says on the product description (so I am not faulting them for this), USB 3.0 hubs can cause interference with 2.4 Ghz wireless devices such as wireless keyboards and mice.  This is something to consider before getting a USB 3.0 hub, and may be a reason to opt for a 2.0 hub as well.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really like this book and would love to read it again!!!! Very well Rick Riordan. I would love to have a mother copy of this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun horse app<br /><br />That all ages can enjoy I think a lot of people will like this app.<br /><br />Get this app I bet you will like it.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This is very addictive, the adventure is pretty easy to follow and the hidden object is really nice. Good graphics, nice flow.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This works really well, my only real issue is I don't have a good use case for it. I expect that will change over time.
1781162646|5.0|I always enjoy Stephen King, but this was one of the very best.  It doesn't rely on the weird or supernatural, just good story telling
B003B02O0A|5.0|After reading Sycamore Row, I had to go back and re-read A Time to Kill again since it has been over 10 years since I read it the first time. I have read all of Grisham's books and I am stunned to have learned that this was his first since I believe it is one of his best. This book captures the reader from the start and though some of it is gut-wrenching, there are also some very humorous parts. It also causes the reader to struggle with the same questions the jury struggles with as far as &#34;what is justice?&#34; If you are looking for a great novel that keeps you wondering how it will all turn out, this is a great pick!
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|This book is worse than the movie... and incest? Seriously? Totally unnecessary! Made the plot even more ridiculous than it already is...
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|AT 70, SHE CAN STILL DO MORE FOR A SONG THAT THE TOP MUSIC ACTS 1/3RD HER AGE CAN.<br />SHE IS THE LAST OF THE GREAT SHOWBIZ ENTERTAINERS. THERE WAS ONLY 1 SINATRA, 1 GARLAND, 1 SAMMY, 1 ELLA, AND THERE IS ONLY 1 BARBRA. AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMER LIKE HER COMES ALONG ONCE IN A LIFETIME. LET'S HOPE SOME YOUNGSTER OUT THERE IS LISTENING AND DREAMING TO BE AS GREAT AS STREISAND. MAYBE THE AUTO-TUNE AND LIP-SYNCING WILL BECOME A THING OF THE PAST AND REAL SINGERS WILL COME BACK IN STYLE.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|More of the same, I wouldn't recommend it, except to find out what happened after the second book left you hanging.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|A nice mix of rock and ballad... The title track will have you cranking up the volume, and songs like<br />&#34;Sleeping with myself&#34; and &#34;Sirens&#34;, will have you singing along with the band. Excellent LP.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|Pointless movie.  I guess if you play the game you may get all fuzzy about it.  Good graphics, action was okay.
B00EQ30RVY|4.0|It's hard to listen to STP and not hear Scott on vocals, but Chester brings a new sound to this group...<br />This EP has more of a &#34;pop&#34; sound to it, unlike the &#34;grunge&#34; sound of old, but it works for me. The melodies<br />and guitar rifts are still the De Leo brothers' signature. My favorite track is &#34;Cry Cry&#34; . This is definitely a top<br />10 in my music collection.
6305428042|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. We had it on vhs and nearly wore it out so I wanted it on dvd. It is good family fun and Bette, Sarah and Kathy are hilarious.
B002ZG9774|5.0|&#34;Burlesque&#34; is a guilty pleasure for me. The plot and story are predictable, but the songs, dance numbers – and lovely ladies of the burlesque hall – are a pleasure to see and hear. Ignore the tawdry tabloid exposure of Christina Aguilera; just watch this move, see her dance, and hear her, and co-star Cher, belt out the tunes.
B005IQZB14|5.0|True story of survival and revival in a harsh world.  Cheryl is funny and enlightening.  A great story for those who have experienced tragedy in their lives.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love this game so much I cant wait to go the dark side. looooove this game I heart starwars . just love it
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|I was just as good as the 1st Monsters Inc. Definitely worth adding to your DVD library. People of all ages will enjoy it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a really fun app.... I don't have much to say about it but I know it is a good, fun app.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app never downloaded to my kindle so I don't know how it works. Not sure what went wrong. I'll have to try again sometime
0205313426|5.0|Brief like White, this book is a must have for anyone looking to hone their writing. Its easy to follow and helps you perfect all aspects of the English language in written form. A must have for students or professionals alike!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I am not a big game player and thought I would give this a try. It is fun but I can only play it for so long.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We now own 3 of these. It is extremely easy to set up. It works great. We gave up Directv after 13 years and much prefer the Chromecast and Roku 3 for our TV watching now. We no longer just leave the TV on all the time and watch random shows.I like that I am able to bring up something on my computer and &#34;cast&#34; it to the TV. Some shows are available online that aren't available on the Roku channels so instead of having to watch a show huddled around my computer, several of us can watch the TV which is, of course, much more comfortable. Great job, Google!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very few apps on Android phones will cast into this device.  When I did cast from laptop, the streaming was not steady but was broken.  Further, there appeared to me no way to stop the screeen on the computer to also play.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|It was a great movie and the ending is superb. I would recommend it. However, there is a little nudity in the beginning.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|Yawn. Nice flying effects but nothing here of substance. I am so glad I didn't go see it in a theatre and waste even more money.
B000059HB7|4.0|Love the adventure, the characters, and especially the music...you don't think of John Waynes and music, he was not musically talented at all. The 4 is because of concern over the romantic interest and her scanty outfits...just keeps it less family friendly.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|I got this app quite some time ago and i must say that it is ENDLESS fun! My little brother and sister both use this app all the time, and they both love it. I use this myself, and am very impressed with the graphics and desings. Highly recommended, and reasonably priced
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Gets a lot tougher as you go up the levels. You have to put your thinking caps on to puzzle this out.
B005R32L66|4.0|Skype is great on computers but on Windows 8 cell phones there is sometimes freeze-framing and/or garbled speech.  Better than average overall.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Best show on TV.  If you can get past the fact that zombies are not real, there is a great story line here!
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Amazing visuals, this was Made to be watched in 3D. To watch this movie any other way would not be as good.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|A highly entertaining read, but more importantly Dick goes into detail to explain how he viewed the world and how to solve problems.  This is one of those books that is a hidden gem for entrepreneurs.
B00DC6YEE2|5.0|Amazing on my 47&#34; 3D TV!! Its like watching it clearly for the first time,  Its like a New movie to me again!
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Great concert and well produced. They covered just about all of their hits and more! Great clear sound and effects!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad candy crush is here!!!all day every day I just sit at home and play candy crush.It's so addicting tht every time I use all my lives I get sooo peed off:) B)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game around!!! With the different levels you can't get bored. I am such serious person......but this is fun!!!!! Love it!!!
0316322407|5.0|Words can't explain how inspiring this book is. It truly enrages you about the injustices around the world, but more importantly the unfairness that takes place within your sphere of the world. The constant stereotyping, double standards, fear and silence of those that profess to be the ones that stand up for equality and what's right. It incredibly shows each individual that no matter where you are in the world, pain is pain and we must speak up against it till the break of day. We must be true leaders and stand up to every injustice as martin Luther says, \\" Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\\" Please read this book and when you read it, be inspired by it and when you are inspired by it , teach it and when you teach it live it.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|because it is a real story written by my brother Marines. This tells from the heart what it is that makes a Marine who he is and why he is a Marine. It is something that is life changing and can not be defined in words. This author does an excellent job describing that. It shows the courage and disciple and character it takes to be a Marine. That is why many try but few make it. Semper- Fi
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I LOVE the 3-disc set. Never realized just how some of these band members intertwined with others such as Linda Rondstadt, Kenny Rogers, and more (Geffen even). I won't go into details as I may spoil some of the surprise.<br /><br />The first two discs cover the history of the Eagles and the third has excerpts from their 1977 Hotel California concert. It's unfortunate that they didn't just include the WHOLE concert.<br /><br />PROS: Variety of interviews<br />CONS: The 3rd disc should have included the WHOLE concert
B002ZG97EC|5.0|A favorite of my 5 and 8 year old and anyone else who loves to laugh!  I have it hid it to get  a break from continuous watching!
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I love this device, it's small, accurate and integrated with the Withings system.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had offered the &#34;vibrate&#34; option as the Fitbit does - very handy for waking for my early morning walks without waking my partner. Beyond that, I am very pleased with performance, with the system which, in my case, includes the Body Analyzer, Blood Pressure armband and the Activity Tracker.  I have a nice history of my results, sleep patterns and blood pressure to show to my healthcare providers when they ask.  Also, I find support very responsive with my questions through email.  Great system!
0345536886|5.0|John Grisham continues to present very enjoyable, well woven stories that really entertain well. He is a favorite author and does not disappoint.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|This game kept freezing up my Kindle Fire. It wouldn't even open. What a waste of time spent to download.
B005K17RU0|5.0|So I have to say, this is the best free app I have on my Kindle Fire HD to date! Has many features all tucked away.. take some time to explore.<br />Very mellow on the ads..Not like some other weather appso<br />Very cool!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|As a musician, I watched this twice and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to give it to musician friends -- we are all retirement age now, and this is very fitting, plus funny and poignant.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The grandkids love this.  I had the 1st Temple Run, the older kids got a bit tired of it but now with the two, all are content and have a great time.  I just have to charge it more because they are on it all the time playing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun. Like the old games that just got harder and harder until you lose. Love challenging my kids
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This was the conclusion for the series and it was really good! It was exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is sooooooooo much fun. I enjoy playing it every day. But let me list some pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Teaches patience<br />Easy<br />Neat challenges<br />Humorous<br /><br />Cons:<br />Some of the things you make can take up to twenty four hours or more.<br />Drains battery (not to badly)<br />It's costs a lot to unlock the dragons.<br /><br />Other than those this game is amazing!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Perfect for all those would be horse owners out there. Its easy t  earn gold and gems for advanced prizes and different  horses. You ca  set a job to run for an hour while you groom or train your horse. Its so much fun.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|Great quality, fun movie, have a large television and it looked amazing, have had great luck watching movies on amazon.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Classic... the kids love the old special effects!  Probably one of the best soundtracks in existence for a movie... Queen will always be 'in'.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|. Fun game.  Can't put it down.  I wish you didn't have to wait so long to power back up.  Still a great app
B000NGTJTY|2.0|boring.. idk if i just wasnt paying close enough attention or if this movie just sucks... but i was bored the whole time..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so awesome I cant believe there aren't more people that have it is more popular than candy crush.  I give this game a total of five stars. I love this game.
B0043JEA14|5.0|This is a joy to listen to - these guys are aging like a fine Napa Valley Cabernet.<br />Many thanks for bringing a much needed smile to my face!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved the trilogy. Took a bit to get into it but once you do you can't put it down. Must read all three
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted to this game from facebook, and my phone, I'm so glad its finally available on Kindle...easily the best most frustrating game out there!
0805047905|5.0|An absolute classic. Every child's library should have a copy of this book. My older son has a copy susceptible to damage by his toddler brother, so I purchased this one for the wee one. It's a board book, so it'll be perfect for me to read to him, or him to attempt eating then bashing into the side of the couch.
1401233791|5.0|This was a gift for a major Batman fan. He was very impressed with the volume and was extremely pleased with this collection.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. The whole family played and we had lots of laughs. Loved the variety of games to play and young kids could enjoy also.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great entertainment. We have been looking for a move a crowd could watch.  With the various ages of adults, we found all enjoyed the move.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I cannot get enough of this book! Definitely keeps you guessing even if you've already read it. Must read this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was addicting from page one!  So many intense moments, so many characters to root for, so many questions to ask yourself.  Very well written, with great visual descriptions that put me right inside the silo.  Loved it!
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|Nothing more than a rank attempt at humor using some unusual things as props. Understand why it spent a short time in the theaters.
B002QYSZBO|4.0|Fantastic movie! Great dialogue, great plot. Love the performances. Hilarious and heart-warming at the same time. Complex characters with realistic motives.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Poor plot. Graphics were occuring to rapidly during fight scenes-only thing that was clear was massive destruction. Would not encourage anyone to spend money to see.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|a very good book, set in Nazi Germany.  The book helps you understand how society can be dupped by false beliefs.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is aGood game. Lots of action. Kind of slow at first but once you get going it's fun.
B00F9F1G4U|5.0|this is a real help,I't tells me when I am not getting a good wifi connection.I recommend down loading it for Kindle owners
B008KZVNFS|1.0|Next they'll be marketing ice cubes in Antarctica... honestly, why can't they either sell us what will work on our machines or just drop this whole &#34;region&#34; crap and make DVDs that work EVERYWHERE?
0061950726|5.0|I loved how this author takes the reader back and forth in time to compare two very different generations of orphans. So much of the early beginnings for both characters was so heartrendingly sad.But I was so happy to read on and find a positive outcome that made me cry.
B00BBI9WD6|3.0|I almost didn't finish this book. The first half was full of history of the planets and long, long boring conversations. The point of each conversation would be made in just a few pages, but then the author keeps them going long after he should have stopped.<br /><br />Then the heroine acts totally contrary to her position as a leading military commander, feeling sorry for herself about some slight and runs off on some mission of her own, while the rest of the convoy get killed off.<br /><br />Since I got the audio version and was on an airplane, I kept on listening. The second half of the book was exciting, when the fighting finally starts.  Weber does some great space ship fights, not much else.
B00GHJ77KO|5.0|I heard this song many times on the Top 40 station I listen to and really developed a liking for it.  Found myself humming the tune so I broke down & got it.  So far not crazy about rest of album but, who knows?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I play castleville and was pleased to find this game for Kindle fire it's a little tougher to get the quest done but it is fun<br />Just glad I had Amazon coins left to purchase the starter pack
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Hello I like this game because it is better than eating pie and ice cream with sprinkles and cheese with salami
B0067AC5KA|4.0|2nd book should have been combined with the 3rd into one shorter version. It was a bit to tedious and long. If the last two books were just one shorter book it would have been great
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Violent. But you can't put it down  Jack is definitely true to his character if you have read other books, you know what this means.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The minecraft game in general is very addicting but for first time minecraft players I highly recommend this app.Minecraft was the game which started my career as a big time youtuber. I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to get the full version of minecraft.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is a book that I would recommend.  I usually read historical fiction but the description caught my interest and I'm glad that it did.  It's a story about life and how every action/choice affects how our lives will turn out.  You will leave this book with an ending but still secretly wish tat another choice had been made.  It will also make you think about your own choices and if they were the \\"right\\" ones.
006202406X|1.0|This series was on its way to being my new favorite. In fact it was--until this last book came out. Never before has a book betrayed me so deeply as this one. I sobbed in \\"Where The Red Fern Grows\\" and \\"Survive,\\" was thoroughly ticked with Fred's (or was it George's?) death in \\"Harry Potter\\", and upset with Suzanne Collin's murder of Finnick, but this takes the cake. I read books to get away from the real world for a while, and can handle a horrendously depressing beginning and middle, so long as the end redeems itself. But Allegiant? How do you come back from such a depressing conclusion? I like to leave my characters stronger then when I found them. Well, that's impossible to do when they're all dead. I feel as if I just witnessed the assassination of Abraham Lincoln or Martin Luther King Jr. Last time I checked, their deaths are amongst the more tragic events in our history. I've read Roth's reasons for killing off Tris, and I must say I'm not convinced of her convictions. I was all excited these were being made into movies. Now I'm not even going to bother to buy a ticket. Why spend money to feel inevitably hopeless in the end?
1609611543|4.0|The author was so intent on getting the point of all the technical sides to wheat that I was nearly lost in the why of going wheat-free.  I felt he provided the bare basics of how to implement and forgot that it's a day-by-day process and no one teaches this stuff.  Valerie
B000002ULO|4.0|Good Strong Album showing the diversity and scope of McCartney as a songwriter, singer and musician. Well worth having in the collection.
B006OISHGQ|5.0|I really liked to try the British accent, I love it. So I won't stop talking with the accent now.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Fruit Drops ll is more fun and more challenging than Candy Crush and the graphics are better too. I love this game! I hope to see another Fruit Drop game coming soon!
B00992CF6W|5.0|How do they have 0.8 on YouTube??????<br />But not for the kindell fire H D :o<br />Hopefully we'll get it Tuesday??<br />Please tell me at!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|easy to get a hang of and simple to start shooting good overall it won't bee easy to put this down
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I like the back of the book were it said morons. LOL! That was so funny . Again LOL! I love your books.
B00746O3X8|5.0|After seeing it the Photo Expo in NY I purchased the harness to do a photo shoot at the Lakota Wolf Preserve. The harness was comfortable, adjustable, fast and secure.<br />Iam very happy with the purchase and would reccommend this product for two camera carry.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. It was so funny! LOL! I love the part were Greg types in help me , help me and his dad comes to pick him up.  I  also have the first three books and I<br /> love them to! I can't wait to read the next five books.Love, Taylie Faith Baldi  Age 9 Many,LA 71449  25 Tina Street
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast paced and packed full of action cannot wait for more. Susan Collins is amazing hope she doesn't disappoint me.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was so funny. The funniest part was when he got the chickenpox he hoped that he didn't have Rowley germs. I hope you will make a lot of more books. Taylie Faith Baldi  Age 9 Many,LA 71449 25Tina Street
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic! Could not put it down! Want to read the other two, DUST & SHIFT. Must read in order: Wool, Dust, &, lastly, Shift.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My friends introduced me to this game since then ive been addicted I love this game so much. It's really fun and I don't seem to have any problems with it
B00908DDZM|5.0|Actually it's not me who loves it. I bought it as a gift for my granddaughter. She told me what to order, so it wasn't a surprise to her. She was very excited that I really bought it for her. Her comment?  &#34;Thank you Grammie. It's just what I wanted!&#34; Sometimes I do things right. My only concern was I had ordered another CD several months before of a different group she &#34;loved&#34; and by the time I gave it to her she said she wasn't interested in them anymore!<br />Teenagers are forever changing, but I'm glad this CD was one she really liked. I gave it 5 Stars, though I haven't heard it, because of the smile on her face when she saw it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever. I loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove it. I play this and candy crush every freaking day. It's totally different from the other games and the awesomest
B00873GRU4|3.0|Enjoyable read. Would recommend it but not so much as to rush out and buy the next one. Worth a try :)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I enjoying playing this game when I'm bored an just trying to pass time. everyone in my family plays it.  thanks!! :)
B00E9A656K|5.0|This is a VERY cool game. I'm personally not the guy who plays racing games but all gamers this game is so awsome I can't even explain it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|never wanted to play games,but let me tell u,once i started playing Candy Crush Saga I became addicted.Now I have my husband hooked as well.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|The streaming doesn't function as great as you would hope it to despite a reasonable internet connection. Maybe it has to do with the processor on the computer? I've tried it off my gaming rig too but the result was bittersweet.
B001BANK32|5.0|just read the book after seeing the movie years ago.  while reading i envisioned the stars of the movie...good ol' Jack....which made the reading that much more fun!min
B005POK858|2.0|I did not realize how terrible an RPG could be on a phone until I tried playing this game. It may not be the fault of the game so much as the genre experience on a smartphone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game and my kids do too. It helps them think out of the box and wexplay it together
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Perfectly snug around the 4S. Protects well from moisture, bumps and kids. The color is very nice too. Its a very pretty shade pf pink and makes the phone look brand new.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love this game it has all my favorite ponies and more. Please try it out if you are a fan of the show but it does take a long time to update.
B00847KFDS|4.0|It is a wonderful CD. Great music! I like all of the different, famous singers with whom he records the great songs.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Terraria is one of the best sandbox games out there! While it doesn't have as much of a creative aspect as Minecraft, it blows it away with everything else. From the weapons to the armor to the oh so fantastic soundtrack, Terraria is a wonderful game that people will enjoy for quite some time!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game it's amazing it takes a while to get to a higher level at level 20.<br />Get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I usually prefer books to movie and was very satisfied with the overall storyline
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Because its great! And Dr. Who. you have to see it and then you will know.. Way to go doctor
B000LB7G00|5.0|This was a replacement for my previous spacenavigator that lasted five years.  That's a good run considering I transported it from home to work quite often.  Happy to have a new one again.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Great action, great suspended, overall a great read. The ending did bother me a little. Why didn't they try that sooner?
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Well written, well directed, great character development.  I've watched this a few times and it's entertaining every time.  Fast paced action, but strong character interaction too.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I just started playing but it is a fun game so far. Great when you have time to kill. I love it's also child friendly. The graphics are wonderful and the storyline is different from similar game types, it's refreshing.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This adaptation of the stage production is not only faithful to the original, but takes it to a whole new level.  Fantastic singing and musical score.  Great acting.  Bound to be a timeless classic.  We expect to watch it again and again.
0316204366|2.0|A disappointing book occasionally based on  somewhat superficial research.<br /> The last chapter uses  obsolete 25 years old materials  written by other people. .A great deal of historical  research has taken place since then , as revealed in the  &#34;Lieu de Memoire&#34; museum that opened this year in the village of Le Chambon-sir-Lignon..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My favorite game - very addictive and challenging. This is the only game that I like being connected to Facebook.  You can help your friends by giving them extra lives and moves, and they can help you.  Would highly recommend.
193659434X|5.0|One of the most beloved tales of Christmas ever written.  It's almost as powerful and moving as The Nativity.  Surprisingly, for those Christians out there, there is a lot of mentions of God and Christianity (something you won't find in the movies, plays and musicals that go out of their way to take Christ out of Christmas).  The story will shock and surprise those who THINK they know the story of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34;.  Buy it, read it, and discover for yourself WHY this book is a classic.
1250038820|5.0|Awesome!!!  A classic collection!  Such a beautiful way to capture life - pictures speak a thousand words.  Great captions too :)
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This watch rocks! It is my first self winding watch and it looks great and works great. I wear this thing everywhere.
B000000W71|4.0|Amazing guitarist and a trip down memory lane. We lost a great bluesman when he died. A collection of his best slow songs.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Classic Science Fiction.  I fell in love with this book at the outset - good character development and exciting story line - faltered a bit towards the end - but the final twist was great.
B00C1MLHRA|1.0|Be aware - while some of the promo and packaging suggests modern value added formats you would expect from a Blu Ray release, this is only 2 track DTS-MA. And not really much better than the original. I looked forward to this new line of Pure Audio products but this doesn't bode well. Be aware - this is a rip. We want more for our bucks than this basic re-issue.<br />please Pure Audio people, I want you to succeed but this is not the way.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Nearly the best sound headset I've ever heard. Overall the sound quality is very well done, very good high end, and nice low end.  It was worth every cent! I've been using it with my wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, and it seems to work all fine.  I had heard that some people had problems getting their headset connected to the computer, but I have never had that problem.  It's also rather comfortable to wear and last for a long time as well. I've had yet to really ran out of batteries, however I do put it on a charger before I go to bed.  Yes, the USB wireless transmitter can be big, but I don't find it too give me too much trouble. My last headset's transmitter had a wire coming out of it which I tripped on and broke... No replacement transmitter for that &#34;Afterglow Headset&#34;, but for this I looked and they do make replacement USB transmitters. Although I doubt I'd ever have to get one. I love the feature of controlling my computer volume right on the headset, and having the programmable buttons for controlling media, and having the mic mute when I don't want to be heard in a conversations.  These features along with it's over great sound quality makes it a great buy! With 7.1 surround sound + sub woofer, gaming is amazing as you can hear what's behinds you, next to you, and just get a feel that you're really in the game. I wish all games are perfected to be 7.1, but the games that are 7.1 enabled make this really worth it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The perfect sequel to an epic horror story. It essentially picks up a short time after The Shining and follows the life of Danny Torrance into adulthood. It is expertly written, and I found myself sympathizing with and being repulsed by the main character. He was real. He was flawed. He was his father's son.<br /><br />Rose the Hat and The True Knot are the most terrifying of all monsters. Not only are they ruthless to begin with, but add desperation and they are a nearly unstoppable force.<br /><br />There is an especially touching moment at the grounds of the Overlook that brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Anyone who ever wondered what happened after The Shining would be well satisfied with this expertly crafted and thrilling horror adventure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is actually more fun than most apps. I usually put games to the way side, but with this game I can't put it down.
B008JFURII|5.0|Funnier than Red 1!!!  Hard to believe but this movie actually has more laughs and twists than the first movie, Red 1.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it! What a twist on how our lives could be we are do fortunate and this book is a great reminder.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|A world view is created that has us asking many questions about our own world.  The author ties it up with a storyline that is hard to resist. The only negative for some readers is that the philosophy tends to run long and many want to get on with the story.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Love it!☺such a great documentary & I am so very happy I found it on amazon.com, it's also on my app so I can watch it anywhere
B003NFM3JU|5.0|Do yourself a favor and get this for the Christmas season. I've never been one of those Dickens/Victorian Christmas groupies but I look forward to watching this during the holiday-a couple of years now since I bought it. The CGI/animation is dazzling and the 3D is particularly effective in this adaptation. Probably the best 3D I've seen so far. The effects in it are a testament to this wondrous computer age. The cast/voice actors fit the film to near perfection. I find myself empathizing with Scrooge and in the Christmas spirit by the end of the movie. B'Gosh there's still a kid in here!
055357342X|5.0|This is such a great series. Very gripping. It gives you a lot of bang for your buck too! A LOT to read in each book. (I sometimes feel like i need to take notes because of the complexity) I highly recommend it!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|A classic. My daughter had never seen it and I was happy to find it on prime. She loved it too.
0345535421|5.0|This is such a great series. Very gripping. It gives you a lot of bang for your buck too! A LOT to read in each book. (I sometimes feel like i need to take notes because of the complexity) I highly recommend it!
B009APMNB0|4.0|About a year ago I purchased the [[ASIN:B0055MBQOW X-Rite EODIS3 i1 Display Pro]] to calibrate my Dell Latitude laptop that I currently use for photo editing.  I was happy with the results of the calibration this unit provided for my laptop monitor.<br /><br />So it was interesting when I was provided the X-Rite ColorMunki Smile for review.  As i didn't want to mess up my software or calibration settings on the Latitude, I installed the Smile SW on a Dell XPS laptop that my family uses.  The installation went without issue, calibration was straightforward, and the resulting calibration was definitely an improvement over the cool tones output by the XPS laptop screen by default - but after some use it seems like the end results have a warm / yellow cast compared to the results obtained using the Display Pro.<br /><br />When comparing the features of the ColorMunki Smile to the i1 Display Pro, it is clear that the Smile is a more consumer-oriented device.  It does not have the ability to measure ambient light like the Display Pro, does not suggest optimal brightness / contrast levels for the monitor like the Display Pro, and is not designed to color calibrate projectors.  (Neither of these is designed to calibrate printers or other output devices - for that you need to step up to the expensive [[ASIN:B00169N0BK X-Rite CMUNPH ColorMunki Photo]] or even more expensive professional products.)  There are also a large number of custom settings for the Display Pro that are not available for the Smile.<br /><br />That said, as a simple device to get a quick and reasonably accurate color profile for your computer or laptop display at a great price (roughly 1/3 the cost of the Display Pro) the Colormunki Smile seems like a winner.
0553593714|5.0|This is such a great series. Very gripping. It gives you a lot of bang for your buck too! A LOT to read in each book. (I sometimes feel like i need to take notes because of the complexity) I highly recommend it!
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|This album is full of many catchy songs and is one of my favorite albums released this year.  I became familiar with this group through the alternative channel on XM radio, initially through the song &#34;Kangaroo Court&#34;.  Other great songs are &#34;safe and sound&#34; and &#34;i sold my bed and not my stereo&#34;.
0553582038|5.0|This is such a great series. Very gripping. It gives you a lot of bang for your buck too! A LOT to read in each book. (I sometimes feel like i need to take notes because of the complexity) I highly recommend it!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Enjoyed the story where the story developed with historical facts of the south and the people both black and white. The twist at the ending with the brother of the main character tells the history of the two brothers. It was quite enjoyable reading.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This was a very intense movie. I didn't think I was going to like it but I did. Of course I always love Denzel Washington and he was good as ever.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This is the second race game that I have to say good things about, but this is the one I like best! I love how realistic it is and you even have a &quot;crew chief&quot; of sorts that talks to you through your races. I love this game.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|After all of the hype, I was afraid &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; might turn out to be as lame as some (most) of the Christmas specials have been. I'm so glad I was wrong.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|Doesn't even open on my Kindle Fire HD. Just a blank screen - and why require other app for this one to work? Just Code it so it works!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|In response to the people saying you don't need the additional font package ($4.99 on the Amazon Store) and to stop leavening low scores for this app I say this...<br /><br />If they are in fact not necessary then Mobile Systems is even more shady than I first thought because when I open the app it tells me I need this package to improve compatibility and brings me here to spend another $5 on top of what I already paid.. in other words this is a scam.<br /><br />Also, why are they charging for basic TTF fonts which can be had for free from just about any public font website. If these are so useful why not let us provide the fonts on our own and now lay again.<br /><br />Another issue I'm having is that this app now shows up twice. The free version and pro versions are bot showing and the only one I can remove from the Kindle is the Pro (the one I paid for)... why is this??<br />Why didn't they make it so it just upgrades the free version to Pro?
B007W4OZ76|3.0|Works, but Dropbox client for which this is required doesn't. Removing both. Why have one work and the other not?
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Even as a Korean-American who was raised in the US, I had heard stories of the conditions in N. Korea, how brainwashed and isolated these people are, but it was this unforgettable account that gave me a glimpse of what life is/was like in a labor camp. I could not put the book down, though it was horrific to read. I appreciate Mr. Harden's thorough investment of time in getting to know Shin and making sure his accounts were as accurate as possible over a period of almost three years. No biographer spends that much time interviewing and spending time with a person. His writing is largely based on Shin's memoir and story as a factual account, without having to dramatize anything in Shin's testimony to draw in the reader with emotional embellishments.<br /><br />Now after reading it, I am disturbed at the relatively little attention that is being given about the brutality and inhumane treatment of not a few prisoners, but thousands upon thousands of people living like savage animals in conditions unbelievable to us in the first world. In this day and age, one would think that masses of authorities and political activists are strategizing to rescue these prisoners, but there is spotty media coverage or political pressure being given to this issue, even given that it's an impenetrable \\"black hole.\\"  This story has now been told and it deserves to be read and heard.
1423140605|5.0|I bought this series for my son.  He is 12 years old and he loves these books.  He read one book, in one day.  I actually had to make him stop reading.  I wish I had checked to make sure all the books in the series was available, although it gives him something to look forward to.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|1, 2, 3. If she doesn't come out w/#4 soon I'm going to lose it lol. Come on Sylvia--it's tortuous.
142311339X|5.0|I bought this series for my son.  He is 12 years old and he loves these books.  He read one book, in one day.  I actually had to make him stop reading.  I wish I had checked to make sure all the books in the series was available, although it gives him something to look forward to.
1609611543|5.0|This book changed my life!  Get it!  You won't be sorry!  This book seemed a dry at first because talks about the history of wheat consumption but it is actually important to know.  After a good history lesson the author explains why wheat is slowly killing us and causes chronic conditions and diseases.  He then tells you how to get and stay wheat free.

B00DXP7L88|3.0|We've loved the Dexter series since it's inception.  Waiting paitently and with excitement for each new season to come out on DVD.<br /><br />All I can say is that this season, while not as terrible in my mind as some have said, was definately a disappointment.  Like many series that run for a number of years, some seasons were definately better than others, but I would say season 8 is the worst of the 8.<br /><br />There were a few good elements of suspense here and there, Dr Vogel being one, and of course not knowing exactly how things would end.....but every exciting ending scenario I played out in my own mind was better than the actual ending when it came.<br /><br />I'm glad we bought it since now we can say we've watched ever single season completely....but I will say I have no intention of keeping it and have already sold the season 8 Bluray.  No reason to keep it !  We'll still have fond memories of the many exciting episodes over the years.....just not many in season 8.

B00EMAGCJM|4.0|I really enjoy listening to it. There are only a few songs that I do not like at all but I can skip over them.
B004FPZ2LI|4.0|I read this book because it was chosen by my Book Club. Ms. Austen does a marvelous job of fleshing out her characters and this book is certainly an eye opener as to the time in which she lived. I really struggled getting through it because times have changed so much. The characters leaned heavily on manners and customs of the time to such a point that it became ridiculous to me. Appearances are highly important whether true or false and, as I read, I came to dislike several of the characters. I'm very much an open person and the subterfuge that goes on in this book hiding feelings and passions did not jell with me. Still, the writing is excellent, so, for this alone I give it four stars.
1594204217|5.0|My sister and I trade Michael Pollan's books.I bought this one for her birthday,when she is finished she'll pass it on to me. We both watch our pennies, but I like hard covers so I bought it used,but wrapped.She won't open it for another month, her birthday is just 2 days before Christmas and I always get her two gifts birthday/Christmas,seems funny to most: but getting it at a good price makes us enjoy it more, yet we can both afford new.
B00008G8M4|4.0|We replaced our VHS copy and this is one of our favorites to watch, it has a little of everything for everybody, PG13 I'd say because of the scary aliens. But a fun Sci-Fi for us.

B003B02O0A|5.0|The story is well written. The twists are on point and very suspenseful. Its a long book but difficult to put down once you start.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Action thrilling and suspend grabbing.  It is nice to see bid being out plagued by  another agent.  It brings competition and thrill to The Ian Fleming's brand.

B00D48BSBA|3.0|Like any other Frederick Forsyth thriller, The Kill List has the minutest details which fascinates his fans. The plot is superb & so is the chase. What lets this one down is the predictable ending, that is unlike several others he has crafted in the past.<br />Pick it up if you are a die-hard fan, but The Kill List is hardly one to die for

0062107313|2.0|I read Tan's [[ASIN:0143119087 The Hundred Secret Senses]] years ago and loved it; I quite enjoyed [[ASIN:0345457374 The Bonesetter's Daughter]] as well. I'm one of the few people on the planet who didn't much like [[ASIN:0143038095 The Joy Luck Club]], but it was Tan's first novel and my reaction had more to do with the way she chose to tell the story than her talent as a writer. Also, I love historical fiction and reading about China. All of which is to say, I had high expectations for this book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it tanked. The book begins with some moderately interesting information about the protagonist's childhood, before launching into a long and detailed description of the high-class brothel in which she grew up, and that's representative of the following 200 pages. If brothels were an unexplored setting in literature, this might work, but they aren't and Tan isn't doing anything here that hasn't been done before. I've already read [[ASIN:0679781587 Memoirs of a Geisha]], and its other (better) imitators, such as [[ASIN:B005M4MSNQ The Painter from Shanghai]]; this novel just feels derivative and bland, its characters more recycled than human, its plot lost in tedious description.<br /><br />I heard an interview with Tan about this book, in which the primary topic was her extensive research, and she talked about spending a lot of time tracking down small details: for instance, when her characters traveled from Shanghai to San Francisco, would the ship have had rails? I applaud her commitment to accuracy, but that preoccupation shows. The setting is here but the life is missing. I finally yielded at page 215, because the story yet to evoke any interest in me and reading it had become a chore. The topic of early-20th-century Asian courtesans, as imagined by modern American writers, is pretty well exhausted at this point. Or at least, this book lacks the depth and vibrancy to make that ground worth revisiting. I hope for better from Tan's next novel.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Can't get my hubbie off of it! He and the kids love it. Great game for when family is sick and just want to veg out.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|I love playing Bingo but it's rigged. You get to the last number and they call it but as soon as they do it declares round over and you can't claim bingo. Happens all the time or it freezes up and you lose tokens. Trying to get the collections is rigged to. When you get down to the last piece needed it never comes up so you can't win. Wish they wouldn't cheat.  #feeling scammed.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive. Great way to pass time. The only bad thing about it is having to wait for more lives.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|It's a very funny movie, as we can identify with most of the characters as someone we work with, really.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Love it....the best star wars app.  It was funny and quirky at the same time!  I loved it so much
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Perfect product. Does exactly what I needed it to do. I would recommend it to anyone looking to be able to watch Netflix, Hulu, or any other streaming company on their TV without having to run a wire to your TV from your internet router.
B0064W67IM|1.0|Completely illegible on portable computers. Unable to read anything at all!. Wasted 10 dollars on this cr*p. Don't waste your money on kindle version for mac. The book looks beautiful on iPAD though.
B00CCMKPO0|4.0|I really like this movie. I saw it on the regular channel on tv. I brought the dvd and did not know that it had so much cussing in it. I wish that they have a machine that could take the cussing out of it. Too much! Otherwise, I really like it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google Chromecast was easy to install, widens the capabilities of my TV, and is very inexpensive for what it does.

B00DQC2FPM|4.0|It's a nice replica of the DeLorean and simple enough to put together. The price is good too compared to other LEGO sets I've had my eye on recently. Include pieces to replicate the car from all 3 movies. My only, minor, complaint is that I couldn't get both figures to sit in the car and be able to close the doors. Good build overall.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|My daughter loved it. It was a big suprise for her party. Her friends thought it was cool and the Party was a great hit.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wrote my analogy on the second book, but this one set the stage, well written you felt like you were right there with them.  Very fast paced , worrisome and believable in its writing.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Supreme acting skills from Daniel Day Lewis. There Will Be Blood has so many scenes that truly make you think about their importance and meaning. No better way to film a movie, act in a movie, cinematography of a movie, and so on, like There Will Be Blood. A beautiful film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Its like going into space, a whole new world to contend with especially with a complete governmental society between the haves and the have not's.  A real page burner (don't think the movie did it justice).
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is an amazing author. I have read almost every book he has written. This book kept me wanting to read it. I didn't want to put it down.<br />Exceptional!!!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow, great Love story and very sensual and sexy.  Didn't want it to end.  Read it three times already and sure I will read the series again/
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I have seen many adaptations of Jane Eyre and read the book numerous times as well.  I enjoyed this version very much as it was a more modern take on the story that focuses more on Jane and Rochester's relationship than on Jane's tortured youth and upbringing.  Wasikowska's Jane seemed strong and confident which was a bit of a departure from the original. Michael Fassbender was mesmerizing, as usual, but too young (and handsome) really to play the Rochesger character. The Jane Eyre adaptation with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsborough is still my favorite and closest to the original book, but this is a good one too.

B002NXSRVG|5.0|The film has lots of action in it and is a keeper.  The acting is above average for a science fiction film, not the usual run of the mill acting.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Game is very good easy to follow ,easy to play, fun, enjoyable.one of the better games.enjoy playing it.building city, and upgrading buildings.
0439023513|3.0|I really liked the first two books... This one ended up feeling a bit forced and unrealistic. I feel like it went a bit more on the girly side with the love and drama, whereas the first book was really more of an action adventure kind of book. But, that's a personal opinion. You won't hate it, and it's an ok conclusion to the series, but don't expect the same style as the first book.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|I think u should buy this game it is the best game ever it is free  and it is good for kids that like kingdom games

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you like reading, video games, 80's pop culture and having a great damn time then this is the book for you. I read a lot and majored in English while in college...this is better than anything I read in school. There is anything you could want in a science fiction/fantasy novel: Romance, Crazy Technology, Friendship, Heartache, Redemption and that all too important &#34;GOD I WISHED I LIVED IN THIS WORLD!&#34; feel.<br /><br />Pick it up if you aren't a loser and want to have a good time.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I am able to watch only through youtube and Netflix. I tried share desktop through this device. But it is very slow.
B0055D3EFU|4.0|I watch a lot of horror movies and this one is pretty dope. Some good scares, creepy scenes and it is genuinely engaging. I generally like anything that James Wan dips his pen into and this movie is worth it.

B00824VSH0|1.0|I ordered two on Oct 29 and it said I could get it by Nov. 21. I know I chose standard shipping so I wish I could get it asap. Then I got my first one a week later, but what happened to the other one? I emailed to the seller and ask why it was. The seller told me it's on the way cuz they sperated them. Well, that sounds reasonable. On Nov.21, I emailed seller again saying where is my book? He said something like thx for letting me know. OMG! Today is Nov.26, I still haven't got the other one yet! Are ya kidding me? Don't ever trust this trustless man! I am done with complaining!
006202406X|5.0|Many reviewers have given this book a single-star rating, because Veronica Roth failed to give an ending with enough hope, or it was too sorrowful and ultimately depressing. That is, however, what makes the book so beautiful. It had me hanging on to the very last page, and I felt it was a very satisfying ending - the happiest? No. But a risky, well-written ending to a great series. The final book to the Divergent series, however sorrowful, wrapped up the story of Tris and Tobias very well: it concluded with painful, beautiful, and wise words, ultimately turning what could have been a frothy, happy ever after ending into a deep conclusion with a powerful message. It felt real and true: not everything good in life can last, but you have to get up and push through, and that js a lesson this book taught very well. Overall, the series is well-written and will keep you hanging on to the last pages.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|I used to enjoy watching Denzel act but lately his movies have displayed a lack of honesty and a large amount of arrogance. i don't know as to whether that was scripted or just Denzel.  i enjoyed the plot immensely.  I think they could have chosen  another actor for the role...think that would have made the role more sympathetic.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I just can't stand the art in this set.... It's horrible! This is Star Wars! I was hoping for something more elegant. Not gonna review the movies themselves cause we all know what's up there. I'm gonna wait till the next blu-ray release... or whatever format they use in the future
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This is a fresh and funny novel,. It think it would appeal more to a female than a male, unless the male is on the autism spectrum.  I had a hard time putting it doiwn.  The ending was a bit abrupt, but still okay.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|It's a good movie, much better than Superman Returns. I am, however, kinda torn down the middle on this movie because of the humanization of Superman & his struggle to be Superman. Still a good movie & I recommend giving it at least one watch.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|This is great for some areas and not so good in others.<br /><br />The sleep cycle information is very useful.  I have been able to get an additional 3-4 hours per week based on the input from the Pulse.<br /><br />The pedometer seems reasonable, but the intensity piece has not matched my experience.  I have done some fairly intense workouts, and the Pulse just records standard walking.<br /><br />The best place to take your pulse seems to be on your artery in your wrist.  The finger method varies wildly from 40 BPM to 120 BPM.
1439190976|4.0|Duff McDonald’s book, The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and Its Secret Influence on American Business, appeals to many different readers. Any businessperson who has worked for an organization that used McKinsey & Company as consultants will find in this book a context in which to place that experience, whether positive or negative. Readers who have never heard of this influential consultancy will learn what it is, what it does, and how it has achieved ongoing success. Consultants of all stripes will resonate with the work McDonald describes. The writing is brisk and is full of stories about the people who led the firm and who formed its corporate culture. McDonald accomplishes in this book what most journalists try to achieve: he catches the interest of readers by the way he calls attention to what may be otherwise overlooked.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was the best! It may have been a little long for me (saying that I hate to read!) but it was just an extraordinary novel! This story made me want to read more and more as I got into it, I couldn't stop reading this! It is THE perfect book for a school report, and also for just reading in your free time!
0316055433|5.0|I often lose patience while reading a fat novel. I find myself selecting how many hundred pages could be jettisoned without losing much value. While Donna Tartt’s novel, The Goldfinch, comes in at just under 800 pages, I never once found myself impatient or wondering which pages could be deleted easily. Tartt’s plot kept me engaged from the opening crisis through the redemptive denouement. The protagonist narrator, Theo Decker, calmly relates his coming of age story from age 13 when an accident kills his mother, until about a dozen years later when his moral compass finds a true course and leads him to face the consequences of his past mistakes. The many other characters are all complex and interesting: fully fleshed out humans whose actions, like ours, are a mix of doing good and choosing a lesser path when expedient. Tartt uses a painting to hold the novel together, and that layer alone made the construction of this novel both interesting and enjoyable. I loved the plot and the characters, as Tartt’s language brought me hours of reading pleasure.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It says to &#34;clear the jelly&#34; but doesn't tell you what is a jelly.  You have to buy more minutes to play, which I won't do.  I was very disappointed.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I simply love this Album, most of the people would criticize and judge this Album based of Gaga's eccentric personality and her noisy behavior, and you may not like those facts on her, but if forget about this things and simply listen to the music, you will find it quite good!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|Rock the way it's supposed to be. Everybody says how great todays rock is but don't you find it funny that the radio is the only place you hear it. Yet you hear all the 80s stuff on the radio used in commercials and everywhere else. That's because 1, they had / have talent 2, you can understand the songs. Not somebody screaming at a microphone, just learning how to play an instrument
B005JE7WKI|2.0|Not funny at all. I turned it off about 40 mins into it. They get mistaken for crazed hillbillies and one of the &#34;hot&#34; girls hangs out for a bit. There are no memorable lines or funny moments it's all derivative drivel. Exactly what you think will happen happens. It's a crap movie for millennials.
1439163154|3.0|An examination of youth spent in a northern California town, Palo Alto, the debut short story collection of James Franco, traces the lives of a group of teenagers as they experiment with adult vices (drink, drugs and more than a little casual violence), struggle with their families and each other, and succumb to wanton self-sabotage and destruction.<br /><br />The stories collected in Palo Alto certainly don't provide hope for the future of American civilisation; the young citizens of Palo Alto seem to be perpetually bored and, all too often, fatally stupid. In `Halloween' a feckless youth, amped up by the thought of beating up a rival, kills a woman while drunk driving, but even that doesn't shake off his ennui and in a matter of years he has managed to forget completely the significance of that particular stretch of road. In `Killing Animals' a wannabe gang of toughs roam the streets vandalising anything that doesn't move and shooting, either with a slingshot or a BB gun, anything that does: &#34;We shot animals and people. But they were all small animals and we didn't kill anyone.&#34;<br /><br />None of the characters portrayed in Palo Alto are particularly sympathetic, but `Lockheed' introduces us to the best of a bad bunch. Marissa is, much to her own consternation, a maths whizz and is awarded a summer internship at Lockheed Martin. Tasked with viewing old film of the Moon in order to record blemishes and splices in the film, Marissa instead spends her days doodling and daydreaming until she is finally invited to her first high school party.<br /><br />For a debut collection Palo Alto is a pretty good ode to the grubbier side of suburban life and contemporary American adolescence. James Franco has done a fair job in thinking up original characters and establishing interesting premises and he is certainly a competent writer. These stories were written as coursework pieces for Franco's MFA Creative Writing programme (he's a very busy fella) and they do come across as being rather studied and contrived. It's not that they are bad stories, not at all, just that they seem rather self-conscious and deliberately styled in the manner of authors such as Bret Easton Ellis.<br /><br />The other major shortcoming of Palo Alto is that, although each story is narrated by a different character, they have all ended up with very nearly the same voice. These are characters, male and female, local and newcomer, differently educated, from different socio-economic backgrounds, and so their stories really should be noticeably different in tone. Neither of these issues completely spoils overall enjoyment of the collection, but they do detract from the individual themes and meanings of the stories.<br /><br />Palo Alto will no doubt appeal particularly to fans of James Franco, but it is worth a read by anyone who enjoys contemporary short stories, and it will be interesting to see what Franco follows it up with.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A great love story!!  It's more than just a very erotic tale, but one that has depth and intrigue and kept me wanting more!
0062015176|4.0|There are arguably three works that best exemplify Beat literature: Jack Kerouac's On the Road, William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch and Alan Ginsberg's Howl. While all three of these works share a celebration of non-conformity and free expression, they also share a controversial journey to prominence. First published in 1956, Ginsberg's Howl is now widely considered to be a prophetic masterpiece, but it had to overcome censorship trials and obscenity charges before becoming one of the most widely read poems of the century. An epic raging against a dehumanizing society, Ginsberg declares his motivation in writing Howl to be:<br /><br />&#34;In publishing Howl, I was curious to leave behind after my generation an emotional time bomb that would continue exploding in U.S. consciousness, in case our military-industrial-nationalist complex solidified into a repressive police bureaucracy.&#34;<br /><br />Howl is divided into three main parts with an additional footnote. Part I is &#34;a lament for the Lamb in America with instances of remarkable lamb-like youths&#34; and contains the most well-known passages of the poem. In it Ginsberg relates the regular lows and occasional triumphs of &#34;the best minds of [his] generation&#34;, the outcasts - poets, artists, jazz musicians, junkies and the mentally ill - whose truth and beauty he felt was being crushed by an oppressive, conformist society.<br /><br />Part II rails against the state of the machinery of civilisation, represented by the demonic Moloch, deeming it &#34;the monster of mental consciousness that preys on the Lamb.&#34; For Ginsberg, mainstream society has - through war, politics and capitalism - sacrificed the heroes of Part I at Moloch's alter of homogenised modernity.<br /><br />In Part III Ginsberg is addressing Carl Solomon - whom Ginsberg had met during a stay at a psychiatric hospital and to whom Howl is dedicated - directly, sympathising with his mental demons and stating that &#34;I'm with you in Rockland.&#34; With his concentration back on his friends and inspiration, Part III is far less bleak in tone than Part II as Ginsberg allows his hope for the future of the &#34;angel-headed hipsters&#34; to begin to shine through.<br /><br />The Footnote to Howl, contrary to the rest of the poem, is almost ecstatic in tone as Ginsberg uses &#34;Holy!&#34; as a mantra to assert that everything that exists is inherently holy and so both beautiful and worthwhile: &#34;Everything is holy! everybody's holy! everywhere is holy! everyday is in eternity! Everyman's an angel!&#34;<br /><br />Howl is hailed as being the first graphic novel to be published by Penguin Modern Classics although really it is more of an illustrated edition [picture book?] than a graphic novel in the traditional sense. Eric Drooker [friend and collaborator of Alan Ginsberg as well as author of Flood! A Novel in Pictures and Blood Song: A Silent Ballad] is responsible of the art of Howl and it's interesting to note that he is billed as having &#34;animated&#34; the book rather than having illustrated it. The reason for this, and no doubt the reason for the unusual graphic style of the book, is that the majority of Drooker's work that is used to illustrate the book comes from the animated sequences of the recent Howl film.<br /><br />Illustrating Howl can't have been an easy business, but generally speaking Drooker's art resonates with Ginsberg's words and so Howl: A Graphic Novel does succeed in offering a new interpretation of the poem. While I do certainly prefer the more obviously hand-drawn and painted pages of the book to those in the clear CGI, screenshot style, the differing methods of illustration do mesh together pretty well. The biggest flaw in Howl: A Graphic Novel is not found in the art itself but rather in the way the poem has been rearranged to fit in with the artistic layout. Knowing the poem fairly well, the changes in rhythm due to the fragmenting of the run-on sentences of Howl to fit in with Drooker's `one page, one image' style seem rather jarring and do detract from the reading experience.<br /><br />It's actually quite difficult to reach a final verdict on Howl: A Graphic Novel. Ginsberg's poem is still great, still relevant and deserves to reach as many readers as possible. The majority of Drooker's art is very good and fairly evocative. However, Howl was already rich in images and so the necessity of fragmenting it and then overlaying it on different images is rather lost on me. Howl: A Graphic Novel is an interesting attempt at illustrating a powerful poem, but it is perhaps not the best way to present Ginsberg's work.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I needed to watch the first 3 episodes of season 5 and they came in good quality with no problem!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Interesting and likable characters. Interesting premise but probably must severely suspend disbelief that a major NY law firm would knowingly keep on staff and misrepresent that an associate has a law degree from Harvard when he doesn't - no matter how much of a genius he is. But it's interesting and entertaining and that's what a TV show is supposed to be. Great plot twists.
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|This 2 disc CD is so much fun to listen to and the more I listen the more I love it.  It is different than their other CD's with a dance type theme and beat.  It makes your feet want to move.

B00GQ8LUEA|2.0|What happened to the writers?  It was as though the writers were caught unaware they had to prepare Dexter for his finale.  What happened to the characters?  Very disappointing end to a once amazing series.... Some of the other ratings warned me of how bad it would be, but I wanted an ending.  Now I am going to pretend Season 8 never happened along with the millions of other disappointed fans.  &#34;Build me up to let me down.&#34;

B001JEPVDM|5.0|My interest in the Rwandan Genocide was heightened when in 2012 I was sent to Rwanda in a partnership for Africa program with the US Air Force and stayed the Collins (Hotel from the Movie Hotel Rwanda). When I was there I went to the Genocide Museum and Memorial and was both fascinated and appalled that this happened. Since I didn't have much knowledge of the incident, I was in 12th grade when it happened, I decided to read this book as it was highly rated. I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />This was/is an amazing book that goes into substantial detail of how and why this horrific incident happened. As is the case with most nonfiction books there is a bit of history on the author and where they came from, etc. This is kept fairly short in this book and is also relevant to the story and interesting. When Dillaire starts the story of what happened in Rwanda you can tell its not going to end well and he does not hide the bitterness and pain that his 1 yr experience in living hell left him with. Be forewarned this book is very graphic and pulls no punches. The detail in which the actual genocide is detailed and how some of the acts were perpetrated is not for the faint of heart, no pictures are needed and thankfully not included. To be honest there were a few times that some of the details in this book kept me up at night and brought a sense how we &#34;civilized&#34; Nations could have just sat back and 800,000 people be slaughter in 100 days. The detail in this book is not written simply to shock the reader, but rather to inform you (the reader) of the brutality and complete hatred that was so prevalent during this event. This book also does a phenomenal job of also describing the excruciating effects on the UN Peacekeepers and Dillaire that witnessing so much death and destruction had on them. I walked away from reading this book mad that the UN and the &#34;leader&#34; nations of the world didn't give a damn about Rwanda and as is continually demonstrated the African continent.  If you decide to buy this book, and I highly recommend that you do, you will understand why I made that last statement. I enjoyed this book immensely and also came away better understanding the sense of abandonment that so many developing countries feel from Western culture and nations, and the continual issues that past colonialism in Africa is still causing today.ontinent.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|The actors and actresses did a wonderful job bringing the story to the big screen completely immersing the viewer!  Well directed!
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle. What can I say. Characters have great chemistry. Plots we'll written. Humor in just the right places! Would make a great gift to someone.
B00000IQW3|5.0|A very surprising sleeper that had special effects, drama, a love story, family orientation, and adventure all rolled up in one!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game  is awesome!!! The only complaint I had was when there was an issue with the cloud, my game was erased, all my guns, upgrades and money. I had  to restart in the first region. I recommend using the local cloud if you get this message.<br />But it's a lot of fun so I didn't mind that much, lots of cool guns with upgrades and. Hunting areas
0694003611|5.0|This story had all my children excited.  After a couple of times, they could recite each page before we turned the page!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I did enjoy this book.  I couldn't tell you why I read it since zombies usually annoy right to the ground.  I mean there is the shuffling and the groaning.  This book brilliantly escapes the trap of making them characters in any sense.  There is a perverse sort of hopefulness to the book: the whole world is truly and deeply in the dumpster.  The worst fears of environmental hell have been set lose by the never ending dead, their eating of all fauna, their tramping of vegetation.  The air is thick with the waste of fires and weapons.  Thanks to their ability to survive under oceans and emerging at island shores, the world is in for it.<br /><br />The style of writing is conversational and engaging.  The depth of the horror is exactly right for the subject.  The author has used interview format, and the emerging personalities of the heroes of the day are varied enough to enmesh the reader.  All in all a book to relish on a gray day when the world is too much with us.  It reminds us there is certainly always a worse scenario.
0679890475|5.0|I love the board books.  They're very easy to clean, and this story is a classic to share with any child.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Maybe it's just my device but this game was a bit laggy. Other than that it was great! I loved the graphics and the interaction in the game.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I know a lot of people rip on Tom Cruise because of his religious leanings, but the man continues to put out great movies that I thoroughly enjoy. Jack Reacher is definitely one of those films. It's a fun, tense and a great movie whodunit with one of my favorite literary characters, Jack Reacher. Although Cruise is perhaps better looking and not quite as hulking as the literary Jack Reacher, he still does an awesome job as the former military MP that is a loner travelling the country with only a toothbrush and a single set of clothes. The fight scenes are awesomely done and the automobile chase scenes are worthy of mention with those portrayed in Bullit, Ronin or The Bourne Identity movies. The villains of the film are also some of the best in years. An all-around fun movie that I hope gets a sequel or two with Cruise continuing to play Reacher.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|This movie was awesome, it was all that i expected it would be!!!! Great movie to watch with the kids.
B00EPZX6FM|5.0|Dave Wyndorf has come through with another fantastic album worth the wait. Monster Magnet is back! Cool grooves and riffs, everything you'd expect from a MM album.
0142410705|3.0|It was an okay book, but definitely my least favorite of all John Green's books. I felt like not much really happened and the whole math thing was kind of blah. I thought there would be a lot more to this book.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|CCR's the best.  If you like CCR you have all the hits you grew up with hear.  Good price too.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|What a fantastic film. Action pact drama adventure film. Acting good. Story good. Usually don't like films like this but really liked this one. Excited to see the sequel.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Great movie for the holidays.  I watched it through and the color and animation of this film is great. My nephews will love this cartoon for the holidays.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Well I love the game but I wish they gave u more bananas. YOU SHOULD BUY IT.<br />ITS SO FLUFFY. OH YEAh ya

B0002F6AH0|5.0|A classic documentary.  It is the model used, in my opinion, used by Ken Burns for &#34;The Civil War&#34;.  Buy it now!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|So so but somewhat repetitive game<br />Could make battles more strategic<br />Also could be a little less pay to win

B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|A truly entertaining book with our favorite FBI agent, Corrie Swanson and Sherlock Holmes.  I read it straight through over the course of two days travel.
B008RVAAPE|5.0|Excellent read,absolute page turner. Great follow up to Pillars of the Earth. Ken Follett is a masterful story teller .
B003G4W49C|5.0|Intelligently written, fast paced, entertaining and very predictive of the future in terms of how wars will be fought.  The perfect book for a e-reader.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can finally play it on my Kindle! I can't believe it took as long as it did but glad it finally made it!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It held my interest to the end. It was well written, interspersed with bits of local color and every day activities.  The racism of the day was well portrayed.
0804161380|3.0|The boxed set comes with each hardcover collectors edition strategy guide. However they do not come with any of the extras the original guides came with themselves. For example the Twilight Princess guide came with a cloth map, the boxed set version does not. I guess its not a major deal given they are re-prints and come with a few collectors pieces, just makes me wonder what I missed by getting this set over the originals
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Much easier to use and more rewarding than most I've tried. Lots of fun. Well worth a few minutes to try. Give it a shot.
B000065V3H|5.0|This was one of our favorite movies growing up. I just had to own it! Such a classic. African anteater dance!!!!

B000YDCFUQ|5.0|I normally wear a 12 but had to exchange these for an 11.5, and I may have been able to go down to an 11.<br /><br />Other than the funny sizing, this is an amazing boot. Super comfortable and durable, you can wear it all day long rain or shine. I am trying hard to not just buy a bunch in different colors.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its completely addicting! 0.8.0 is coming out soon with redstone, cobblestone walls, 3-D clouds and more!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S.  ionosphere's the updatesvcome slow for kindle but just be patient. I hope u found this reveiw helpful!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is fun but could be more disruptive on how to do things such as trading etc.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|My husband and I can't stop playing this game. We have a little competition going on.... the only problem is that we ran out of lives fast and it takes a while to load more
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its fun and exciting. I loved it, laughed a lot playing it. Made my day playing it and so did my grandson.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is by far th  best book series that I have ever read, and I can't believe that it´s already over.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|This was a marvelous addition to the series, giving purpose to the future doctor, as well as the endearing quips between three doctors.  It gave us much better insight into the time war with the realization of just how badly it affected the Doctor with repercussions we have seen since #9.  The real gem was the final few moments by Tom Baker who still retains a childish spark behind those eyes.  And when all of the Doctors stood together, it really gave me a sense of how long the journey of 50 years was and the stories that I know, the ones I did not, and the ones--sadly--I can never know.<br /><br />Doctor Who became for a brief moment something more than a TV show.  It was a shared experience that transcended generations and gave us all something in common.  It was a story worthy of the Doctor.  It was an experience that only the Doctor could give to us.  In the face of a terrible tragedy he gave us a reason to hope, and a reason to believe that we can always place our hopes in him.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Let's be clear, the low score is about the pricing of the episode, though it's closer to a movie in length.<br /><br />The episode is fully worth the money spent. I will most likely be watching it multiple times over the course of the next week, trying to wrap my head around all the insanity and brilliance contained in these too few minutes.<br /><br />So, the review (where I attempt to be as spoiler free as possible):<br /><br />There is so much cheating of time and timelines that go on in this episode. Things that were taken for granted are no longer value because everything has now changed.<br /><br />Many old friends return. Read that again: many. Especially for the old guard who fell in love with the show before the reboot. It has so much for us that it really does make it out to be the 50th anniversary rather than just a big budget adventure somewhere in the season 7 to 8 transition.<br /><br />For the fanboy/girl, it's a got all the little tidbits and hints and shoutouts that people wish for, but never expect to actually come to fruition. Only, this time, they somehow fit everything into a cohesive, contained story that makes you really have to think about where it fits, how it fits, and HOLY TARDIS OF GALLIFREY, WHAT'RE THEY GOING TO DO NEXT!?
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The games is a lot of fun with the exception that I didn't get my crowns I paid for due to the fact that I lost power on my kindle right when I purchased them, that has upset me because I have no way to contact Amazon customer service, or at least have not figured out how to contact them, otherwise good game
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Nice graphics. Easy playing,yet challenging. Don't like buying things in order to continue. YES,most certainly recommend this fun game. Is great !
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple set up, simple to use. So much more convenient than using our PS3 to stream Netflix and music, and so affordable. Ready to buy a second one.
B00B8R1NP0|3.0|I rated this book a three star because I found it too predictable.  Congratulations on your first book, I'm sure the next one will be better.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great read - this story pulled me in and I pretty much read it straight through.  Quite a wait for the next book, however.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|On my journey, I have found many books that repeat the same messages regarding personal development, however this book really challenged me. I found guidance to reframe why I believe what I believe from the moment I was given information from my parents.<br />Awesome and practical!
B001QD5OSS|4.0|Blow (2001), is wildly entertaining, if I were a movie critic it would give it 3 and a half out of four stars, it was a very interesting powerful story about the rise and fall of George Jung and to think I first heard about it in a big rig truck on a road trip, (in a friend of mines dvd collection that I watched). It is indeed smart, sexy, and dangerous and  I recommend it to anyone who likes true story drama movies. And also the dvd makes a fine addition to movie collectors.
1476734941|5.0|I have never been on a diet before this one, but I have lost 14 of my 16 lbs that I wanted to lose, so far, and can easily do this diet for the rest of my life. It truly is, &#34;the diet for people who love to eat.&#34; Have nothing negative to say about any part of it. Book is an easy read, and very good to get started on the 5:2. Cannot recommend it enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game they are always updating and has fun challenges fuse :) be e hehe enshrined brushed vegetables peace
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Piper tells the truth about her 13 months in prison ...a truly educational experience ... and makes us aware of the huge waste of human potential involved.  Her fellow prisoners are real people who share a real bond and survive despite the stupidity and cruelty of their jailers.  This is no salacious exposé in the \\"women behind bars\\" mode, but a thoughtful, rational look at the reality of incarceration and one inmate's eventual triumph.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app. Works the way I expected it to. I love the fact that it has a time and I can customize when it turns of, or I can leave it on all night.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I grew up with Evangelion, and enjoyed it immensely when it first came out in the 90s.  This is part 1 of 4.  The animation has been redrawn frame by frame and looks amazing.  I swear I am looking at the same animation sometimes because they are so similar to my VHS tapes but they aren't.  Every frame is super sharp and detailed.  It just looks super amazing in HD.<br /><br />All our favorite characters are here, and even the American voice dub of Shinji is annoying like before.  I just wish he wasn't so annoying, but I guess that is his character.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Evangelion, you need to pick this up.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|i love this game i play it with brother on the wii and at walmart in the game center. i love it
B00EV4EUT8|4.0|\\"Lee Daniels' The Butler, while taking liberties from the original source, is a commendable effort with Forest Whitaker's performance as a subtle, understated White House butler in a more grounded light than we would normally see with recent race-oriented films like Django Unchained or a film from Spike Lee (which many of his films talk about something tough but boil down to a heavy and potentially one-sided argument).<br /><br />The film reflects much of the butler's years working since childhood to an elderly age and it reflects his life in motion with his alcoholic, disenchanted wife played by billionaire Oprah Winfrey, his rebellious son who joins the Black Panthers and demonstrates at sit-ins, and his naive youngest son who goes to Vietnam. It was a very interesting experience to watch this fictionalised persona Cecil Gaines (Whitaker), based on the real-life Eugene Allen, play it so good-to-the-bone that there is an inner sadness and melancholy in his character that amid the rebellion (son), negligence (wife), he still remains strong-minded and has a goodwill, something that is relatively important for audiences to watch and discover.<br /><br />The film also gets even better with some comic relief provided by Cuba Gooding, Jr. played a White House server too as well as Terrence Howard playing a smarmy, perverted neighbour. In addition, the cameos shown in the film maybe stereotypical but are relatively humanising and interesting to watch especially Liev Schreiber playing a catankerous old Lyndon B. Johnson (who led the Vietnam war) and Alan Rickman playing Ronald Reagan (whilst bizarre and accented unusually, still works in a funny way).<br /><br />Much of the set designs, cinematography, and editing (especially at the cut-away scenes) are well-done within the constraints of its budget much relating back to what the team done on Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, the film suffers a bit with a slightly simplistic narrative (which isn't bad given Whitaker's character and the tone of the film), a missing scene from the trailer involving Black Panthers shooting at the police, restraint from showing the horrors and carnage of both whites and blacks amid segregation, and a vague ending.<br /><br />While a political piece, it could've been better. As a film, it was beyond satisfactory enough and it didn't falter in the cracks like Oliver Stone's W. (2008) or Dr. Strangelove and many young people will be able-minded to understand its themes and ideas without being bored by the history of it all, especially with the rebellious son and his struggle to develop his identity.<br /><br />Without remorse, the film is tough material but it is important on several levels. Unfortunately, the state of affairs as of today are a result of much of this chaos (whether it be identity, race, economic status, housing, culture, and labour). But for many people-of-minority who watch the film, a lot of questions will be asked about and a doubt and inner ambition to find liberty and non-pressure elsewhere is still an uncertain one.\\"and the tone of the film), a missing scene from the trailer involving Black Panthers shooting at the police, restraint from showing the horrors and carnage of both whites and blacks amid segregation, and a vague ending.<br /><br />While a political piece, it could've been better.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|Great adventure book for most ages.  The vocabulary might be a bit difficult for middle school but it could help them learn new words.  I wish more answers were given at at the end but it did leave me wanting to read the next book.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really like this game. It has really good graphics and an expanding map for more fun I find myself playing everyday.

B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|This Pendergast mystery is, of course, readable and entertaining, but of the series it is not the best.  Taking Pendergast out of his element and neglecting the excellent previous characters detracts from the novel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game! I can't stop playing! This is way better than temple run and subway surfers because it doesn't get old. I highly recommend this game. Have fun!!!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Hey, it's Star Wars!!  What's not to love, particularly when you get to experience how the whole thing started!!  George Lucas' masterpiece!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is a Christmas classic.  Everyone needs to see it. I guarantee you will laugh your jolly little butt off.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Complex writing for a complex tale. Perhaps her best yet. It will be hard for her to write a better one then this one.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|Great value at a great price. Child's Play is and still will be one of the cult classic for years to come.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you are an Android enthusiast you NEED this! It is so simple and fast. Just pick your show and throw it to your TV. I've had it for about a month and it has already been used more than our Apple TV has been used in the last year. Great gift idea.
B00GQ8MZDU|1.0|This season sucks, season 1,2 and 4 were the best. The rest were just a waste of time and absolutely horrible. Watch Breaking Bad<br />if you want something intense because most people will lose interest in dexter by the fourth season.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Very nice backpack. I'm a big Timbuk2 fan but I really like the design and build quality of this item. The zippers and pulls are high quality and it fells like this bag will be around for a long time. Would recommend.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Highly addictive pinball game. probably the best looking pinball game on the market. You can play this game in portrait or landscape mode and looks very nice in both modes.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Extreme amount of violence and very graphic scenes.  The movie is really about the graphic violence and not about the characters or the storyline.  Children under 17 should definitely not watch this.
B004T32SOK|5.0|This is pretty much like the other mobile Box apps. There really arent many ways you can mess up a cloud storage app. It's easy to use and great for those you use cloud storage.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|To be honest, I couldn't finish book two. I didn't catch fire, so to speak, until I went to see the movie. And then, i came home and bought book 3, consumed by the need to know, all the while knowing, how it would end.<br />Beautifully written..i love the taut prose...it reminds me of Hemingway...yet the picture gets drawn all the same...<br />A great & polished finish.
B00C1MLHRA|4.0|HD Audio Blu-Ray is as different from CDs as CDs are from cassette tapes. Each improvement in technology places demands on equipment and what one considered to be &#34;adequate&#34; or even &#34;great&#34; gear in the past evolves. Improved source material demonstrates that such assumptions about the adequacy of playback equipment erroneous. In other words, playing a $25 disc in a $200 player is like listening to a vinyl record played with a nail: it works and that's about all.<br /><br />Listening to HD Blu-Ray requires a level of equipment refinement to which most people balk and few truly appreciate. Listening to HD Blu-Ray discs through my OPPO BDP-105 gives me hope for digital media where other formats fall short.<br /><br />If you expect to hear an improvement in audio playback of any Blu-Ray audio disc while listening through your mediocre system, definitely pass on this disc and any other. If you have a serious investment in a high-end system, you will most likely appreciate Blu-Ray Audio as a superior signal source.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|This turned out to be an excellent movie. The lead character(played by Danny Tejo) is set up by crooked law enforcement officers. The dishonorable law<br />enforcement are on the payroll of a drug lord named Torres(played by Stephen Seagal). This set up results in his wife and daughter being killed by the<br />forces of evil. He reemerges as an unknown. He starts finding these people who are in league with the drug lord. A businessman played by Jeff Fahey is<br />the go between for the Mexican drug lords. In the meantime Machete is killing the forces of evil. Robert Deniro plays the role of an unscrupulous man who<br />is running for  reelection. He has the full support of the drug people. Another villain of note is played by Don Johnson. This is an action packed movie that<br />has nonstop action. @Watch Machete fight the forces of evil.

1250037751|5.0|This story follows the journey of a young man named Clay Jannon who finds a job at a quaint and quirky bookstore. While working the nightshift at this bookstore, Clay encounters a variety of unique and eccentric customers. The strange thing about these customers, however, is that they never buy any books; instead, they merely ‘check out’ the oldest books in the store. Clay soon discovers that there is much more to this bookstore and some of the books inside it than he thought. We, the readers, then follow Clay on his journey to decode the mysterious books and everything that goes along with them.<br /><br />This book was truly a fun delight to read. It wasn’t filled with any overly heavy, dramatic subject matter and was an extremely entertaining book. I would actually say this book was the definition of entertaining.<br /><br />First, I loved the entire ‘book’ focus and aspect of the novel (which is somewhat obvious, being the huge book lover that I am). I loved the bookstore itself and how it was described; I loved the huge, towering bookshelves and the different types of books (i.e. “regular books’ and the “Waybacklist”).<br /><br />When I first started this book, I don’t think I realized how big of a role that modern technology would play in it. I feel that most authors who try that are either really successful or fail miserably. Luckily, Sloan was extremely successful. I found the topic itself to be very interesting, and I found myself intrigued by the programming and coding that was used throughout. I think all of it added a really nice touch to the story.<br /><br />There was a very unique array of characters that each had an extremely distinct and entertaining personality.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of the novel was Clay himself. He had such a witty and fun narrative that truly captured you and brought you into the story.<br /><br />The pacing of the novel was spot-on; I never felt that the story was too rushed. I also did not find myself getting bored from the  novel moving too slowly either. The novel seems a bit far-fetched at times, but it is fiction and that it extremely understandable.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be an extremely well-written and exciting novel that I would definitely recommend to anyone.

There isn't a cliffhanger there isn't even something to lead you into what the next book might be about.

Individual courage, honor, freedom and treachery are all here in Michael Collins. And having an Irish wife makes the watching all the more interesting!

If you are confused already, what this refers to, as the title indicates, is the compensation arrived at when private property is subjected to being `taken' by authority of a government, which subsequently compensates the owner financially, at least one jolly well hopes so.<br /><br />We are assuming that this is the same often problematic process that is referred to in the UK as `compulsory purchase'  in which land or property is purchased -- compulsorily -- from an owner to make way for, say, a new road, railway, airport, housing development or whatever, whether the owner likes it or not.  From this emerges the knotty problem of evaluation.<br /><br />`Quick,' says Richard Epstein of New York University, writing in the Foreword, `what is the present value of your house?' In other words, for what sum should you be compensated if your house is subjected to compulsory purchase?  In the UK in recent years we have a kind of Delphic oracle for that:  an Internet site called Zoopla - and there are other sites too, which quite often, apparently know more about your property than you do.<br /><br />However, using examples from both New York and Taiwan, the author Yun-Chien Chang explores and analyses in precise and often technical detail, the methods by which compensation may be arrived at, taking into account, not merely property values, but the complexities of, for example, mortgages, taxation, relocation expenses and so forth.  As Epstein quite rightly remarks, `... data from both New York and Taiwan lend solid support to two propositions that we all wish were false: valuations are inaccurate and political influence plays a role throughout the process.'<br /><br />With these dismal thoughts in mind, one might be cheered up a bit by the stringently logical analyses of this and related problems provided throughout this thought-provoking treatise, which is divided into two parts: the theoretical framework and empirical analysis.<br /><br />Part I - the theoretical framework  -- elucidates the three behavioral theories of those government officials charged with the decision making process at the heart of valuation and saddled here, poor souls, with the Harry Potter-esque label of  `condemnors'.  Emanating from whatever dense thicket in the groves of Academe, this lovely and very apt term will doubtless become popular in everyday speech, especially among `condemnees.' -- people who have had anything to do with government officials in a not particularly good way.<br /><br />In all, this is a rigorous and intriguing piece of research, which explores succinctly, yet in detail, the pros and cons of various methods of compensation and offers suggestions aimed at arriving at those solutions which will offer maximum economic value and social benefit.  Academics, students and policy-makers, as well as practitioners will find this book eminently useful as a stimulus for engendering further informed debate, certainly on a range of land-use issues which are almost invariably difficult.smal thoughts in mind, one might be cheered up a bit by the stringently logical analyses of this and related problems provided throughout this thought-provoking treatise, which is divided into two parts: the theoretical framework and empirical analysis.<br /><br />Part I - the theoretical framework  -- elucidates the three behavioral theories of those government officials charged with the decision making process at the heart of valuation and saddled here, poor souls, with the Harry Potter-esque label of  `condemnors'.

Unlike the rest of Canada, Quebec, for historical reasons, is a civil law jurisdiction.<br /><br />Mackaay's book offers an overview as well as analysis of the concepts pertaining to law and economics as applied to civil law systems and is illustrated throughout by cases and examples from legal systems in both North America and Europe.  With Canada being a common law jurisdiction -- the province of Quebec being the exception -- Mackaay, as one commentator has observed, is `able to bridge the gap between common and civil law traditions'.<br /><br />As the author states as well as implies, law and economics, in recent decades, have been recognized to be inextricably linked, `giving rise each year to a significant number of conferences, papers and books and teaching programmes throughout the world.... and gaining acceptance  as a significant tool for legal scholarship.'<br /><br />The book is therefore divided into two parts; the first --Foundations -- provides the economic tools required. The second part -- Legal Institutions -- examines the core institutions of civil law including property and real (estate) rights, intellectual property, civil liability and contractual obligations.<br /><br />Certainly the book contains the fruits of the author's impressively extensive research activities in this field.  There are extensively footnotes with references and lengthy bibliographies at the end of each chapter.  The detailed twenty-page index at the back aids navigation. Besides tables of abbreviations, cases and treaties, there is an extensive table of legislation relevant to the contents of the book, which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the United States, as well as the relevant European Union directives. Usefully for researchers and scholars, each chapter has a massive bibliography and there's a twenty-page index at the back.<br /><br />`The economic analysis of law offers interesting insights to common lawyers as well as civil lawyers,' remarks the author in his concluding statements, adding that `law and economics joins hands with comparative law.' So whether you are a lawyer or economist, this book which examines civil law and common law systems should ideally be added to your professional library.at the back aids navigation.

Recently published by Jordan's it has already been referred to as the definitive work on this now weighty subject and in our view, so it is.<br /><br />The two-tier tribunal system, as we now know it, was established by the Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and came into force in 3 November 2008.<br /><br />As the authors point out, `the Act marked an important step in the evolution of the relationship between the executive and the individual in this country,'  `The new tribunal system forms an important part of this changed relationship,' they add, commenting further that the said relationship is now more responsible, responsive and accountable.<br /><br />Covering all aspects of the tribunal, the book  encompasses the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal. Practitioners will recognize that the First-tier Tribunal is currently divided into six chambers to include such matters as health education and social care, immigration and asylum, social entitlement, war pensions and armed forces compensation and tax.<br /><br />Chambers of the Upper Tribunal include administrative appeals, immigration and asylum, lands, tax and chancery. The functions of each are of course explained lucidly and in detail.<br /><br />Also examined in detail, specifically in Part I, are the various aspects of the conduct of a tribunal, from the preparatory process and the hearing itself to such matters as evidence, the decision, the challenging of decisions and appeals.<br /><br />Costs, representation and enforcement are also covered. It should be mentioned that the book does not cover employment tribunals which actually fall under a separate category emanating from what were originally referred to as `industrial tribunals' and excluded as mentioned on page 22 of the book because they are seen as a rather separate type of Tribunal.<br /><br />The latter section of this hardback volume of more than 900 pages is divided into seven parts which cover - and we are listing them here - statutes, statutory instruments, practice directions, practice statements and forms.  Part 6 provides guidance notes made by the President of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber).<br /><br />Furthermore, as you would expect of a volume of this scope and stature, there are extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, practice statements and practice directions.  The book is nonetheless easily navigable, with each chapter prefaced with its own individual table of contents and a detailed general table of contents at the front.<br /><br />For those charged with the responsibilities of tribunal work, this is a formidable yet readable and accessible work of reference.

It is the introductory first section that provides the practitioner with a thoughtful overview of the fundamentals, including, for example  the meaning of `family law' followed by brief, but thought provoking examinations of the relative merits of inquisitorial or  adversarial processes and the issues concerning the exercise of judicial discretion.<br /><br />Part B on case management covers a wide range of matters, from undertakings and appeals, to enforcement, consent orders and costs. Part C scrutinizes the rules of evidence applicable to the full range of family proceedings, including relevance and admissibility... burden and standard of proof... disclosure... privilege... and of course, much more.<br /><br />As Burrows points out, the availability of legal aid is dwindling and it is likely, he says, `that efficient and fair case management by the courts (administration and judicial alike) is likely to prove to be the only way that the family justice system can be kept afloat.'<br /><br />With considerations like this in mind -- as well as a host of others -- the publication of this book is timely and certainly its practical approach -- complete with illustrative cases throughout -- is a boon to the family law practitioner.<br /><br />The research undertaken to produce this volume is formidable, with extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, plus a detailed table of contents and index. In our view, this book with its entirely contemporary outlook should become a valued addition to the family law practitioner's library.

It focuses on the search for legal tools, both domestic and international, that are, or may be available in the attempt to address this global problem.<br /><br />Over two-dozen leading academicians in the field of climate change -- and its legal ramifications -- have contributed as many thoughtful and insightful articles to this scholarly and topical book which certainly raises awareness of the problem and its possible remedies from a global perspective.<br /><br />Divided into two parts, the book first examines the context and the principles pertaining to the relevant climate change issues: impact and regulation, for example, as well as sovereignty and adaptation.  Part II analyses the environmental issues facing specific indigenous groups, which include the indigenous people of the `Lower 48' states of America, the Inuit or the Canadian arctic, the Saami people of Finnish Lapland and the people of the Pacific island nations, as well as Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Africa.<br /><br />Most of the distinguished contributors hail from some of the world's top universities.  Dr Irina I Stoyanova - a fairly typical example -- has lectured at Columbia University's Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race and has devoted her dissertation to the current struggles of the world's indigenous communities in voicing their concerns and participating fully in decision-making processes.<br /><br />There are some members of this team of contributors who are themselves members of indigenous communities.  Interestingly, one of the editors, Elizabeth Ann Kronk, is an enrolled member of the Sault Ste. Marie (pronounced `Soo Saint Marie') Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Canada.  It should perhaps be noted that such groups are commonly referred to as `First Nation' people in most parts of North America.<br /><br />In all, the book contains some fascinating research.  Those seeking further insights into this wide ranging and complex subject will appreciate its copious footnoting and detailed index,  Environmental lawyers and researchers especially, will inevitably regard this book, with its range of legal perspectives, as a valuable and enlightening contribution to the literature of climate change.cing their concerns and participating fully in decision-making processes.<br /><br />There are some members of this team of contributors who are themselves members of indigenous communities.

B00A9ET4MC|4.0|The opinions on race expressed in this book are not intended for KKK members, but for the average liberal-minded folks out there. And judging from many of the reviews here, it looks like the book manages to make some of those folks uncomfortable. I’m glad it does. On the other hand, this is not a plot-rich novel full of deep characters, and the main character's opinions on race are a big part of the book. Moreover, I see the shallowness of most characters but the two main ones as more of a literary technique than a weakness. Having said this, I do agree the ending is kind of weak and the book is rather long.

[because] only in this way can we protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, as much a man's own, and as much the fruit of his honest industry, as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears.'<br /><br />This, in our view, not only says it all, but provides much insight and ammunition for further debate, as does the rest of the book, which, within its almost 900 pages `brings together the  most compelling scholarly research in the sphere of Intellectual Property Law' as a commentator from Berkeley quite rightly puts it.<br /><br />For IP lawyers especially, it is scarcely credible that there remains a question mark over whether intellectual property is property.  Nonetheless, if the matter is still a debating point among the legal fraternity -- whether in the UK or US, or wherever -- there would have been no reason to amass such a judiciously selected list of learned articles on the subject as Mossoff has done. Fortunately, the shades of opinion expressed in this volume appear to support Mr Justice Woodbury's utterance to the letter.<br /><br />The book is replete with almost countless references to cases, -- in footnotes and in the body of the text -- mainly from the US, which support the concept that intellectual property is property indeed. `Patents shall have the attributes of personal property,' says one judgment involving Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in 2005.<br /><br />And we can't help quoting a particularly fierce judicial comment in a 1984 case involving a chemical company, that `deliberate unlawful copying [of copyrighted works] is no less an unlawful taking of property than garden-variety theft.'  We also can't help agreeing with one authority's description of this book as `a valuable reference work' and `a must-have volume for serious students of intellectual property and property alike', as another commentator calls it.<br /><br />Part of the publisher, Edward Elgar's series entitled `Critical Concepts in Intellectual Property Law', this book stands out as a valuable acquisition for lawyers, judges, legal scholars and policy-makers as well as researchers and all those who need a handy, single-volume resource for understanding `the labors of the mind' and the dire need to protect intellectual property and property rights. The editor has included relatively recent materials in this volume, which was published in 2013.2005.<br /><br />And we can't help quoting a particularly fierce judicial comment in a 1984 case involving a chemical company, that `deliberate unlawful copying [of copyrighted works] is no less an unlawful taking of property than garden-variety theft.'

Formerly a lecturer at Cambridge University and now an Associate Professor at the Copenhagen Business School, Savin refers to Marshall McLuhan's influential work, `The Gutenberg Galaxy' which predicted back in the sixties, that that the world would eventually become a `global village' - a phenomenon which, driven by the Internet, has actually occurred.<br /><br />As Savin points out, the Internet is different from all other mass media in that it can be used interactively and is thus participatory. `It turns passive consumer into active players and contributors,' he adds, going on to explain that this is a direct result of its architecture, `which promises low cost, decentralization and anonymity.'<br /><br />At the beginning of the Internet's history, it was thought that here was a free medium that could never be regulated.  Time, usage and events nevertheless have somewhat unfortunately revealed that such a powerful medium is subject to abuse of the freedom it offers.  The European Union has therefore evolved a panoply of regulations and instruments across a range of areas from electronic commerce and jurisdiction to content regulation, intellectual property, consumer protection, privacy and criminal regulation.  What the book provides is a succinct, readable and well substantiated analysis of the way in which these elements interact.<br /><br />The book also deals with such matters as liability of intermediaries, consumer protection and marketing, data protection and privacy, electronic payments and cybercrime.  The chapter on speech and content regulation covers such thorny and topical issues as control of illegal and harmful content... free speech and defamation... copyright infringement and sexually explicit speech and hate speech.  Here, as in other chapters, helpful comparisons are drawn between European and US regulatory activity pertaining to the Internet.<br /><br />Distinguished by its clear and practical approach, this  book provides an accessible and absorbing  read  certainly for lawyers, students, researchers and indeed journalists as well as - actually - anyone who uses the Internet either as a recreation, or as a tool for business and who is interested in the evolving legal landscape which impacts upon it.<br /><br />In particular, those doing research in this complicated and controversial area will appreciate the extensive footnoting, not to mention the useful index, and the tables of cases of the European Court and of secondary legislation.  The law is stated as of 1 June 2012.pical issues as control of illegal and harmful content... free speech and defamation... copyright infringement and sexually explicit speech and hate speech.

The appearance of this book published by Edward Elgar in 2012 reflects a growing awareness worldwide that environmental damage and armed conflict are inextricably linked.<br /><br />As Professor Duncan French mentions in the Foreword, environmental harm is increasingly recognized as both a consequence and a cause of military conflicts; the most commonplace example being resource scarcity.<br /><br />You could extrapolate from this argument of course, that resource scarcity is a more potent cause of human conflict than, for example, ideological or religious differences between communities.  Whether you are comfortable with this view or not, this book, the result of massive and painstaking research, offers ample evidence which supports the author's basic thesis that environmental security must be actively sustained as a bulwark, so to speak, against  the continuation and escalation  of human conflict worldwide.<br /><br />'Environmental pressures,' explains Das, `can, in some circumstances cause violent of armed conflict and such conflict can in turn, cause devastating damage and destruction to the environment.'  This `vicious circle,' she adds, creates a number of consequences not the least of which is the pressure and the damage that can `often extend beyond the territories of conflict-affected states, threatening the lives and livelihoods of people across communities and borders'.<br /><br />The aspect of war and armed conflict in environmental studies, as Das points out, `has not received the attention it deserves,' a matter which this book seeks to address - and does so quite convincingly in our view, citing a number of illuminating case studies along the way.<br /><br />Because of its subject matter, the recent appearance of this book is certainly timely and worthy of close scrutiny, especially by those involved professionally in this complex area; academics and postgraduate students obviously, as well as policy-makers and yes, environmental lawyers.<br /><br />Environmental researchers especially, will appreciate the book's extensive footnoting and the literally hundreds of references for further reading contained therein.  The book also provides a listing of relevant abbreviations, tables of cases and legislation and an index at the back which aids navigation and ease of use.  As the subtitle indicates, this book certainly provides a research-based and thought- provoking perspective on sustainable development in a truly international context.gly in our view, citing a number of illuminating case studies along the way.<br /><br />Because of its subject matter, the recent appearance of this book is certainly timely and worthy of close scrutiny, especially by those involved professionally in this complex area; academics and postgraduate students obviously, as well as policy-makers and yes, environmental lawyers.<br /><br />Environmental researchers especially, will appreciate the book's extensive footnoting and the literally hundreds of references for further reading contained therein.

It has now been ratified by almost all EU states, the UK included.<br /><br />Designed to improve the legal position of children (up to age 18) involved in cross border disputes, the 1996 Hague Convention is the last of three conventions which include respectively, the 1980 Hague Abduction Convention and the 1993 Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption.<br /><br />Writing in the Foreword, Diana Bryant, Chief Justice Family Court of Australia mentions that Australia was one of the earlier counties to ratify.  The authors have therefore set out the legislation in Appendix 3 and there are references to Australian cases which -- quite importantly for the practitioner -- provide some early jurisprudence.<br /><br />The full implications of the 1996 Convention are yet to be seen.  But broadly, families will feel more secure knowing that their legal rights with respect to their children can now be enforced and also, as the  authors point out, `courts and administrators will be faced...with orders made by foreign courts which they must take into account and which define the structure of the family.'<br /><br />An extremely positive result of the 1996 Convention is that  it has also been ratified by Australia, Croatia, Morocco, Russian Federation, Switzerland, Ukraine, Uruguay and the US, with Canada and New Zealand seriously considering it.  It has therefore developed, say the authors, as `an important international instrument dealing with issues of increasing global relevance.'<br /><br />Beginning with a history and overview of the Convention, the book deals with such matters, for example, as jurisdictional rules, applicable law, recognition and enforcement.  Chapter 7, dealing with a difficult issue, focuses on the impact of the 1996 Convention on International Child Abduction.<br /><br />For the hard pressed family law practitioner dealing with children in international situations, the book is timely -- and fortunately, clearly written and easy to use.  Each chapter is prefaced with its own individual table of contents and there's a detailed table of contents at the front.  There are extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and three appendices containing the full text of the Convention as well as all relevant source material.<br /><br />As a work of reference, this book truly excels.  Every family lawyer dealing with children in an international context should acquire a copy. The law is stated as at 1 October 2012.ictional rules, applicable law, recognition and enforcement.

0375703861|2.0|I read the reviews and, naively, bought the book based on these.  I confess that I only read it half-way through.  First I thought it was quite amusing and that Archie was going to be a good character study.  Also Clara and Alsana promised to be interesting.  But Archie sort of disappeared into the background while his friend Samad took over and gradually I became bored with all of them, especially with Samad's lectures and lamentations. As another reviewer said, I put the book down and didn't feel like taking it up again.  Perhaps someday I might try, but there are more interesting books around.

I also had amazon send me a replacement which had the same issues. I am long-time EC fan and strongly recommend this disc if your TV can dim out the noise - otherwise IT WILL DRIVE YOU CRAZY.

B00DQZT38G|4.0|Just got mine a few minutes ago. This is the first tablet cover I've owned for the first tablet I've owned. Initial impressions...<br /><br />The fit between the kindle and the cover is very good. The kindle snaps into place with a sensible amount of force, and it's held firmly just around the top and bottom edges of the unit, so (a) there's no concern about it coming out by accident and (b) the case doesn't cover any of the bezel, so it doesn't make the screen seem any smaller than it really is. All the openings in the kindle, e.g. camera, speakers etc, remain properly exposed.<br /><br />In the closed position the look and feel of the cover are really great. The fabric on the front and back and the leather around the spine both feel nice in my hand. It looks like it will provide a decent amount of protection, particularly to front and back and to the left/right edges when held it in the vertical position. The top and bottom edges on the other hand are not completely enclosed.<br /><br />The cover doesn't add any significant bulk to the kindle, and though I guess it adds some weight (9oz against the kindle's 13oz) it doesn't make the unit feel unduly heavy.<br /><br />In the open position with the kindle in the horizontal display position on my desk, the cover is not as stiff or stable as I thought it might have been. There are two shallow tabs on the lower edge of the part of the case holding the sloping screen that engage with any of three grooves in the soft interior lining of the part that's lying flat on the desk. The grooves are relatively wide, so the tabs just sit in them - they don't click in, so you're partly relying on the friction of the surface to ensure that the thing stays where it's put. Indeed the thing will stand quite happily even with the tabs outside the grooves.<br /><br />The other thing to note about the cover in this position is that the part of it sitting behind the kindle and holding it up in position is what becomes the soft spine when the thing is closed. So it's not at all rigid and if you tap on the kindle, particularly on icons at the top of the screen, it can wobble a little bit.<br /><br />Finally, I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about the cover in the open reading position, with the front folded back behind the kindle. Because of the softness of the spine, the cover tends to move a bit in the hand. It's maybe not quite as comfortable an experience as I thought it might have been, but then again the only comparison I have is with holding the kindle on its own.<br /><br />All in all a pretty decent cover, though perhaps a touch expensive for what it is.

So despite the shoddy Amazon packaging, the set still arrived in perfect condition thanks to Prima's packaging.

1781162646|5.0|King does it again!! Joyland is classic for this amazing author, and the small size of such a great story makes this little book a great read. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as it kept me guessing till the end. In his later years, Mr. King has graduated toward stories about life and love instead of gore and suspense (though enough of each is present in this tale to make all fans happy.) Joyland is about losing your first love, getting over the bitch that broke your heart, and learning to grow through pain as an adult. Throw in the most colorful, unique summer job full of lots of carnie fun (not to mention a murder mystery to die for!) this tale touches the heart and makes it skip a couple beats at the end as well. Every fan of Stephen King should pick up this novella just to enjoy how well his writing has advanced and changed yet still captivates at the same level it did many decades ago.

1446249182|5.0|Andy Field's wit is significant at the .00001 level!  (I'm just worried my students wish he taught the course.)  This book covers everything that one could possibly expect in a combined introductory/intermediate textbook, all for under $100, and how he manages to slip in a virtual SPSS manual to boot adds further value to this splendid text.  OK, some of his humor is borderline pre-adolescent, but it counters the usual uncomfortable aura around Statistics, and he does impressively explain statistical concepts at various levels of difficulty with a conversational style that makes it easier for a student to digest.  My only small gripe is Field does not mention basic chi-square until page 721, after covering topics such as multiple regression, MANOVA and factor analysis.  (I like the bivariate analysis to come before the multivariate, but that is a small potatoes issue, and I sort of see why he did that to fill out a chapter.)

B004GYY714|1.0|This app worked fine a month ago and now it doesn't after its most recent update.  It refuses to play any station and repeated gives a message about a mysterious problem that forces it to close your selection.  However, it's now showing that something is playing in the Ongoing feature that I can't hear.  Another in a long line of modern conveniences that send you back to old conveniences.  In this case, that old convenience is a actual radio.

031620157X|2.0|I have read about 76% of this book, and it has been a painful experience.  The writing is subpar, the characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is boring and predictible.  There is an overuse of adverbs and uncolorful adjectives to hide the fact that the author has no ability to describe anything.  He simply tells the entire story like it is a screenplay.  There is no characterization whatsoever.  I don't care if any of the characters live or die.  Alex and Conner are unlikeable... one second they are crying, and the next second they are running off to their next adventure like nothing happened.  Don't even get me started on the ridiculous similes that are thrown onto every page.  I was so excited to read this book as it was highly recommended by one of my friends,  but it has literally been like pulling teeth just to get through it, and I still haven't finished!  I am certain this book was published just because the author is famous.  I have to finish it now since I've already tortured myself for days, but I'm not expecting any magical ending.  I am a school teacher and I will NEVER recommend this book to any of my students.

Really, really like this game.

B00FHB7398|4.0|I liked this game for the storyline and the bonus content. It was nice to play from the villain's pov. What I didn't like was the load times between some scenes. An actual loading screen popped up and this made the gameplay kind of bad. If you can tolerate such disruption to your gameplay then you might like this game. The tap interface worked well and the inventory wasn't obstructing the screen like on some games. The strategy guide was helpful as were the hints. The puzzles were not too hard or too easy. Overall, a good game for my kindle fire hd 8.9.

1476727651|5.0|Review of Dr. Sleep by Stephen King<br /><br /> Stephen King proves once again that he is still at the top of his grisly game.  In the 36 years since The Shining’s debut many readers have wondered what had become of Danny Torrence, that adorable kid with the special shine.  King delivers that and more in the sequel to The Shining, aptly titled Doctor Sleep.  Daniel Torrence is all grown up in this horror masterpiece, and he shines like never before.  All of the suspense and dark humor King is famous for keeps the reader turning the pages and horror hounds who follow the genre will love the nod he gives to son Joe Hill’s creepy tome, NOS4A2.  Fans of The Shining will love how King revisits many of the minute details that made The Shining such a hair raising thriller.  If you have never read The Shining, never fear my fright loving friends, Doctor Sleep is a novel unto itself, weaving a story that will chill and delight in equal measure, proving King is just that, the king of horror.

B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This book tells the fascinating and frightening story of the nuclear weapons programs in the USA better than anyone could ever imagine.  It is supremely researched and portrays the real humans who did all the work with compassion and heart. It truly is a miracle there has never been a nuclear weapon detonated outside of testing since Nagasaki; no one else could take credit for that safety record, though Schlosser gives starring roles to the few who doggedly fought to make the weapons safer.  The villains should be the Russians according to the usual propaganda, but clearly the generals in the various armed forces pull the role of the villain off the best.  Their egos and ambition trump safety, reason, transparency, and humanity at every opportunity.  Thank goodness the civilian leadership stood their ground, from Ike to Kennedy to Jimmy Carter, the latter ultimately buckling before the generals' and the military industrial complex's will.  This is never played out more clearly than in the pulse-pounding recounting of the terrible Damascus accident, the centerpiece of this incredibly thorough, brilliant book, the most important book since &#34;The Deaths of Others.&#34;  It is mind-boggling how much money and effort went into nuclear weapons in all their forms, all a monumental waste in the end.

B00DXP7L88|1.0|This season was such a letdown for all Dexter fans. Who wrote this ridiculous ending? I don't know if the writers were pissed at Michael C. Hall for wanting to end the show or what. I felt like it was the Sopranos all over again. I watched every episode, and for it to end like this.... It would of been better if it was one of those &#34; it was only a dream endings &#34;. The greatest endings of a series are<br />still The Bob Newhart Show, and St. Elsewhere. If you don't know what I am talking about.... Watch two great series and find out.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|absolutely a wonderful book!!  The story is about the strength of family in horrible conditions and in a time of unimaginable war.  The relationship of the young girl and her &#34;step family&#34; is very touching.  The descriptions and language used by the author are vivid and real.  While this book is intended for young adults, i found it engrossing for me as an adult.  The relationship the young girl has with her friend Rudy and the young Jewish man they hide from the Nazis is moving.  The power of written words is immense.  i recommend this book to everyone - young and old.  I am looking forward to the movie.

2226249672|5.0|I was leery about buying this because the author's detective novels are frequently compared to the work of Stieg Larsson whom I do not read.<br /><br />In this novel, where much skullduggery is afoot, humor, wit, clever turns of phrase, foreshadowing that takes the reader consistently down wrong paths, careful plotting and luminous descriptions make this story of two men and their responsibility to each other a joy from cover to cover. The characters are straight out of Balzac, whom the author credits at the end of the book along with Ajar, Dumas, Carson McCullers, Proust andonandon.<br /><br />While this is not exactly a love story, the two soldiers who meet in a shell crater just before WWI's armistice, are bound to each other in various ways by this rescue.  Among other main characters, there's an evil aristocratic lieutenant, a businessman father who detests his effeminate, artist son, a twelve year old girl who brings joy back into one soldier's life and, in the sea of corrupt French officials, one honest man.<br /><br />The English translation is supposed to be available in 2015.  If you read French, don't wait.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Good pace - disturbing but I couldn't put it down.  The end wrapped up quickly however, as I have found to be true in Flynn's writing style.  I think this one was better than Gone Girl.  Can't wait to read next one.
B000002LGA|3.0|While I love the ambitiousness of the album, and some of the lyrics are excellent, on a musical level most of the songs are too repetitious for me. It's hard for me to listen all the way through, because the songs just get irritating to me. The songs I particularly like are Dime Store Mystery, which has a haunting vibe and mysterious lyrics, and Dirty Blvd., which has a catchy groove. But the other songs just get bogged down in a melody that just repeats over and over again. I have to say, though, that the lyrics are very good. Strawman, Beginning of a Great Adventure, and Busload of Faith, in particular, are very thought-provoking and/or funny. At the time, this album was kind of a back-to-basics thing after the 80's flavored Mistrial, and also is a refreshingly candid look into Lou's world, but honestly, I can't listen to this from beginning to end. It just gets to be too much after awhile.
020530902X|5.0|Great little book.  I got a refresher in English all over again.  The small compact book is very user friendly and it can fit easily into my hand bag.  This book makes reading English grammar &#34;fun&#34;.  I would highly recommend this book.

B00DJZ06DO|5.0|FUNimation that is, who released Evangelion 1.11 & 2.22, and are scheduled to release 3.33 in February of 2014.<br />This however is a Malaysian release, Japanese audio with Malay, Chinese and English subtitles.  Furthermore, it's really the 3.0 theatrical cut--<br />Well, thing is, the FUNimation releases are a few minutes longer than their 1.0 and 2.0 theatrical counterparts, with some visual improvements, thus the double digits, each two discs; movie & special features.<br />This thing, almost twice the price of either of FUN's, is one disc, with no extras.<br />Why then do I five star love it?<br />Well, it's Evangelion; I got to see it early and it'll be interesting to compare it with the real 3.33 version; and did I mention it's Evangelion?<br />Or rather, the Rebuild of Evangelion, an intended four-part remake of the TV series (Neon Genesis/Shin Seiki Evangelion to give its full U.S./Japan titular due; shin seiki means new era, century, etc., the official transliteration being Gospel of a new Century); the fourth part (yet another new conclusion*) is slated for a 2015 release, in Japan that is, but given the erratic production history of this often troubled franchise I'm not holding my breath.<br />*Darn, I've again forced myself into a bit of a tangent--but s'all good, y'all.<br />The rushed and budget-restricted, not to mention annoyingly confusing two-episode conclusion of the TV series (I'll spare you the details) was a bitter disappointment to the production staff, particularly producer, writer and director Hideaki Anno, and worse, utterly despised by the series' many fans, who weren't shy about making their feelings known to Anno, et. al (when displeased Japanese anime fans tend to be worse than a pack of rabid Trekkies, as Leiji Matsumoto found out when he killed off most of the beloved Space Battleship Yamato cast in the second movie).<br />This resulted in two 2-part movies:<br />Death & Rebirth; Death is a clips condensation of series episodes 1 - 24 with new linking scenes, while Rebirth is about the first 3rd of the second film (a sort of bonus preview I suppose).<br />Originally to be titled Rebirth, the second film's two all-new parts, billed ep. 25 & 26, were intended to replace the series' final episodes with a more 'real world' (not mention more sane) conclusion.<br />Still unsatisfied, Anno decided that the only way to tell the 'real' story of Evangelion (essentially the Apocalypse rendered in SF terms and involving the heavy use of Christian, Shinto and other religious allusions and symbolism often too archaic or abstruse for the average viewer to 'get') was to start from scratch, thus the Rebuild, for which, to assure freshness, Anno chose to employ a whole new studio and staff (probably to the great relief of the originals).<br />And thus endth today's sermon; thank you, Brethren, and take care; I'm off to watch something simpler, like Satoshi Kon's Paranoia Agent (n'yuk, n'yuk!)
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I'm sorry I let the &#34;Cruise&#34; hate keep me from seeing this in the theater, they definitely deserved my money for this film.  Enjoyable from beginning to end, the story has a flow, and while Reacher (the character)  is almost too good at everything he does in the books, Cruise plays him as a mere mortal, with a few flaws but obvious humanity.  It's an action movie with believable action (no extended superfast choppy cut fight scenes) and some genuinely laugh out loud funny moments that catch you by surprise because of the dark subject matter.  It's the kind of movie you can't pass by if you see it's on.<br /><br />Really hope this gets a few franchise movies.

1623360277|5.0|In 2011, I read [[ASIN:1583333002 Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure]] for health reasons, and made the switch to the whole foods plant-based diet. Although I had been a \\"part-time vegetarian,\\" the first several weeks were tough, but it got easier, especially as I got healthier, lost weight, increased energy and got off several medications.<br /><br />Since that time I have become more and more convinced that this is the best lifestyle for me, and have been picking up more and more books to better equip me. I've become a fan of Lindsay Nixon (The Happy Herbivore) and we love her [[ASIN:1935618121 The Happy Herbivore Cookbook: Over 175 Delicious Fat-Free and Low-Fat Vegan Recipes]], as well as her other titles. I've enjoyed books by Rip Essenstyn, including [[ASIN:1455509361 My Beef with Meat: The Healthiest Argument for Eating a Plant-Strong Diet--Plus 140 New Engine 2 Recipes]].<br /><br />Lately I've read [[ASIN:1937856240 Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition]], by T. Colin Campbell, author of [[ASIN:1932100660 The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health]]. And I recently decided to take a look at this volume by Dr. McDougall. While all of the above authors fall into the same food camp, McDougall stresses the importance of complex carbohydrates (starches) in our diet. He clearly points out the all around the world, healthy populations base their diets on starches (whether it's corn, wheat, potatoes, rice, taro root or other starches).<br /><br />In the diet he promotes here, he says you can eat as much as you want, until you feel full. And you will not only lose weight, but will get healthy in the process. I'm already convinced that it's true, because I've been following him on Facebook and have given this modification to my diet a try for several months. I feel more satisfied, and I have not gained back any of the weight I lost when I first began the diet.<br /><br />In these pages, Dr. McDougall tells the story of his personal journey in discovering this way of eating, and how he eventually started his own clinic in northern California. He addresses the poisons of meat, the healing power of the starch-based diet, the politics of food, and how, with our current American diet, we are eating our planet to death. He addresses questions about where you get your protein and calcium on a plant-based diet. And he discuses the problems of fish, as well as how you can be an unhealthy fat vegan (I know some, and what he says makes perfect sense).<br /><br />He also explains why it makes sense to get away from supplements, and he talks about the benefits (yes, benefits) of salt and sugar.<br /><br />The latter third of this volume is a cookbook by his wife, Mary McDougall. I have not tried any of these yet, but as I skim through the pages, they look delicious, easy to make, and completely in line with other plant-based cookbooks I've been using.<br /><br />While I can heartily recommend all the books mentioned above, I think this one by Dr. McDougall would be an excellent starting point. Give it a try.

1781162646|3.0|As a former Stephen King fanatic, I have read most of his books and really love his earlier work. The Stand is one of my all time favorites. I have not picked up a King book in a while because I feel that his more recent works were becoming formulaic. How many portals into another dimension can one come up with? So, I was really excited to read that King had written something fresh and new (and sans portal).<br />With the Hard Case Crime label, I expected more of a Spillane type flavor, but it was really more similar in feeling to Stand by Me.<br />I enjoyed the nostalgic feeling of this book. The descriptions of the park and the characters were charming and vivid. The development of the characters was lacking, in my opinion. I never felt invested in any of the characters and the plot did not hook me. I thought about not finishing the book a few times, but because it is a light and easy read, I continued.<br />The &#34;...and the killer is...&#34; moment was a snoozer as the culprit is very obvious.<br />All in all, it was exactly what the three star rating denotes: &#34;It was okay&#34;.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was the second time I've seen it, and I still really enjoyed it. Terrifically acted and the setting were believable and extraordinary. We streamed it directly to our Vizio 70&#34; and it was great!!! Bravo Hunger Games and Bravo Amazon!!!!

0064431622|4.0|My son is 26 months and we've had this book for about a year now. He wasn't really interested in it when we first got it, but now he loves flipping through the pages and identifying all the animal parts. I have a feeling that he will grow to like the book more as he gets a little older. Right now he doesn't have as much patience to be read all the words on the page, as he likes to move ahead and look at the pictures. But the story is cute, so once his attention span gets better I'll be able to tell him a story along with the pictures. This isn't a classic like the Caterpillar or Brown Bear, but it's a cute story nonetheless.

B00CO4GO7I|5.0|If you need a kick in the butt, or to rediscover you patriotism. Maybe you need to feel that hope that there are still great, unselfish people left in the nation/world. Or possibly to center your moral compass. Most of all, if you need someone or to read something to aspire to and find a truly inspirational role model for yourself or someone you know; this is it.  Highly recommended.

B009VMN3RA|2.0|Where does this mother daughter relationship go from here? I felt heart pain for both of these women after reading this book. The stories and recollection of events are from a single point of view and in this case, a hurt child's point of view. One can certainly understand Sachis pain and loneliness as a child. What seems to be missing is the adult dimension of understanding life's contradictions.<br /><br />By the end of the book, I felt an awkwardness; such as walking in on a family fight, knowing both parties are lost and injured.<br />Although Shirely is the mom and the weight falls on her to be the bigger person, I couldn't help but wonder how I would have handled large sums of money with children. My educated guess says Shirley made some big mistakes parenting, and she knows she did. She certainly paid a hefty child support payment each month, buying the freedom to be a star and celebrity. I doubt that Shirley was aware of the severity of abuse and neglect Sachi experienced in her fathers care. I have to wonder how much of Shirley's grandiosity is compensation for missing the most basic need and primal instinct of protecting ones child.<br /><br />I hope to see these gals work this out, in this incarnation.
B00005V9IL|5.0|In this pulsating thrill ride of a science fiction film, a group of blue collar workers and a group of navy seals attempt to recover a grouping of nuclear war heads from a crashed submarine, and in one of the greatest twist endings of all time, we learn what has brought all these people here<br /><br />This movie is easily a 99%, its moody, well proportioned, has a good sense of friendship and mystery behind it, and the only real problem this movie has is the fact that it can't be described in words what makes it so good.<br /><br />Buy it, you'll be glad you did.
0307949508|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I have all the trilogy only hate that it had to end. I am sad I will never again read a new book from this author.
B001609SQA|5.0|In one of the only good sequels to ever be released for a classic film, Sigourney Weaver and a Group of Marines confront a horde of Aliens in an attempt to bring down the specie for good. There are only 4 sequels that matter, Aliens, The Dark Knight,<br />2010: The Year we make Contact, and Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back.<br /><br />This is a 100%, I'm not going to try and justify that rating, just watch it.

B008602KQI|1.0|This movie is one of the worst i've seen in a while.<br /><br />Its big budget and hipster fan base aren't enough to save this boring piece of work that should have stayed at the library.<br /><br />In the end I will say this movie was easily a 0%- Its long, boring, and leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Okay, Spoiler Time!<br /><br />Now most people thought this film was some all new and completely original thing, but it is far from it my friends.<br /><br />This movie (and it's book series) RIPS-OFF the Japanese Battle Royale to a ridiculous degree.<br />Everything in this movie was ripped off from Battle Royale; The Future, The Tone, The Set-up, The Rules, The Entire Movie...<br /><br />The Hunger Games SUCKS, and it's author is a no talented hack.<br /><br />So, is my score different? Nope, i'm sticking with the 0%. I'm telling you, the author REALLY rolled the dice on this, and it's a totally unoriginal bomb.

B003EVWDR0|3.0|The statement that this is the greatest movie ever made is false, its not and I can assure you of that.<br /><br />The movie is splendid, with great actors, sets, story and wonderful direction.<br /><br />There are deeper aspects tot his movie but despite these, the movie is 78%- Despite being a Great movie with an incredible vision and innovation on CGI, its brought down by all the over hype and over representation in popular culture.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I really haven't used it much so I guess that's an indicator that I don't find much usefulness in it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|If you want a pass the time entertaining game. I suggest this one. It will keep you going and makes you want to win.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Different from the Facebook version but fun nevertheless. I miss some of the play ability of the Facebook version but I assume that this is fairly new and will keep being improved.
B000008JUM|5.0|For the most part great interpretations of Cole Porter music by Rock musicians. Some clinkers in the bunch, but the rest are good enough that you can forgive that.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard! Unfortunately I'm too used to the Swype layout, so I'm just more productive/efficient via Swype. But this is a great keyboard and I love the GUI.
1616550414|5.0|I am a Zelda fanboy and have been since the first one came out for the NES when I was a kid. I still play many Zelda games on emulators and it brings me right back to those days. This book is filled with awesome artwork, back-story, timelines, etc. for the Zelda fan in your life.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This application is worth it. It's very easy to use. The only thing is that it automatically deletes the oldest documents when you save new ones. Other than that, it's good.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Awesome, great, wonderful, so many words to describe the game. It barely has any flaws, although i wish that logging  into facebook wasn't the only way to sea trade, otherwise great.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Kindle would not let me download the YouTube viewer. I tried three times, and failed every time. I find all this very challenging.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great book again by Nicholas Sparks. Different from the movie, but still with the same bittersweet ending. The ending threw me off, at first thought it was going to be a totally different ending than the movie. Great reading for someone looking for inspiration when lost in love.
B00006I53S|5.0|Fast Shipping! Even threw in a case !! No problems at all with the lense!! I love it! It hasn't come off my camera much since I purchased it.

B001R6AW18|4.0|Posting an original review of \\"King Kong\\" is like posting a review of a film version of \\"Hamlet\\". What can you say that hasn't been said before? Therefore, I will briefly state the following.<br /><br />The 1933 \\"King Kong\\" is not polished, not sophisticated, and not intellectually profound.<br /><br />However, it is dynamic, engrossing, suspenseful, charming, powerful, and poignant.<br /><br />It illuminates the eternal \\"MAN/BEAST\\" dichotomy, incongruency, and conflict.<br /><br />In other words, the (as of this writing) 80-year-old \\"King Kong\\" is immortal. Not many movies are.<br /><br />One more observation: I always get a kick out of this dialogue exchange on the ship Venture between first mate Jack Driscoll and Captain Englehorn:<br /><br />Jack: Is he (i.e. Carl Denham) crazy?<br /><br />Englehorn: No, just enthusiastic.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|OMGosh! Great movie with an excellent message that every father/man needs to see.  Families need to watch it.  I am waiting for the next Kendrick brothers movie. We have watched them all. My husband recently passed away, so now when I watch this movie, i am in tears because it was one of his favorites and he truly believed in the message. He lived the message.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|The process to purchase and watch was easy and straightforward. I didn't have to empty my cart or finagle with resolution settings.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this game.  I play it on my Samsung Galaxy SIII and my Kindle Fire HD.  Game is fun to play and makes you figure out your moves to complete those quests.  Others thru sea trade sell their extra stuff .  I just wish the would sell more hinges, because you need those to upgrade your storage. TIP leave items you crafted and Don't collect and it won't add to storage.<br /><br />One thing I don't like is the huge amount  of coin you need to get a building or expand.  It raises alot.  And I really hate feeding the TROLL - he eats mass quantities at each feeding and I always run out of storage. And you can't use coin to upgrade it.<br /><br />Make sure you send friend's XP every day, collect your chest from storage and spin the wheel with the mermaids.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|As much as it pains me to say it, this album is a bit of a throwaway for me.  I've been a huge fan of Pearl Jam from the very beginning, but when this came out it was the first time I just wasn't along for the ride.  Of course there are a few songs I like, but I don't listen to it often.  Now, having said that, because this is Pearl Jam and I love and respect their music and their constantly evolving sound, the handful of songs I enjoy from this album beat several entire albums from other bands.  The songs I enjoy are Life Wasted, Worldwide Suicide, Severed Hand, Unemployable, Gone and Inside Job.  The rest of them I gave up on after about 5 or 6 listens because there are some albums or songs that just don't grow on you.<br /><br />I can't exactly explain what it is about the bulk of this album that I just don't like, but I do know that the critics gobbled it up like a next-day turkey sandwich.  That does make some sense because typically everything I enjoy pulls in the worst critical reviews from media outlets.  Many reviews called this album a &#34;return to form&#34;, but every album is different so I'm not sure what they returned to.  It definitely has all of the elements of a typical Pearl Jam album, meaning great music blended with interesting and thought-provoking lyrics, both chaotic and melodic in parts.  However, somehow the band just seemed to stray a bit further off the beaten path on this one than they have before, at least for my taste.  Either way, There are plenty of good rockers on the album, including the first 3 I mentioned.  &#34;Gone&#34; is an incredibly poignant social commentary with lyrics like &#34;when the gas in my tank, feels like money in the bank&#34;, that's delivered with a perfect blend of acoustic and electric guitar.  &#34;Inside Job&#34; is an incredible song, one of the best instrumental pieces the band has ever done.<br /><br />I would still recommend this album because I know that many people really do enjoy it and that fact that there are several different reviews with different ratings proves that not everyone hears the same piece of music the same way.  Long live Pearl Jam, I will always love these guys even if once in a while they put out an album I'm not as excited about.hat there are several different reviews with different ratings proves that not everyone hears the same piece of music the same way.

0736092269|5.0|This is by far the greatest informative and technically correct book Ive used in my practice. I have learned so much and benefited from the information provided in this material.
B00APKIN1I|4.0|This album is a collection of songs recorded on the Neve recording console that was vital to the sound of some of the most classic albums of all time, recorded at Sound City.  Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters, Nirvana) bought the console when Sound City closed and invited a group of artists who had recorded there to his home studio to make new music together.<br /><br />What's particularly striking about this album (for me, at least) is how every song has a very unique style, tailored to the style listeners would expect to hear from its guest star.  In that regard, it's far more of a collaborative effort than most guest appearances tend to be.  For example, &#34;You Can't Fix This&#34; featuring Stevie Nicks sounds much more like a new Fleetwood Mac hit than Stevie playing with the Foo Fighters,  and &#34;From Can To Can't&#34; featuring Corey Taylor (Slipknot, Stone Sour) sounds like a Stone Sour type song.  Another song that follows this formula is &#34;The Man That Never Was&#34; featuring Rick Springfield that does a great job to take Rick's 80's sound and kick it up a notch.  &#34;Your Wife Is Calling&#34; featuring Lee Ving (Fear) takes it up another few notches, starting with Lee shouting off &#34;1,2,3,4...1,2,3,4&#34; before the sonic assault begins in true punk fashion.<br /><br />As with the last Foo Fighters album, Dave brought former Nirvana bandmate Krist Novaselic into the fold for &#34;Cut Me Some Slack&#34;, featuring vocals by Sir Paul McCartney.  Fellow Foo guitarist Pat Smear is also included here but I doubt anyone involved intended for it to be considered a &#34;Nirvana reunion&#34;.  It's a great song though, with an interesting guitar sound and unusually raw vocals from Paul.  One of my favorites is the last song &#34;Mantra&#34; featuring Dave on drums, with QOTSA singer Josh Homme on bass and NIN's Trent Reznor on keyboards.  It's more of an experimentation of sounds than anything with Dave singing main parts before building to an exciting crescendo with Trent adding vocals as well.  The rest of the songs are good but the ones mentioned here I feel are the highlights of the album.  The sessions for this album are part of the Sound City film, for those who haven't seen it.  I highly recommend the movie and this album for any fan of great music with an impressive gathering of talent.o with Trent adding vocals as well.

The Blu Ray disc also brings out the best quality.
B00G722T22|4.0|Not my favorite album by Avril Lavigne but still good with some decent tracks (favorites are &#34;Give You What You Like&#34; and &#34;Hush Hush&#34;) but the other tracks are good enough, though not entirely memorable.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|easy and quick to use lots of ways to use it and my kindle now runs faster than before I installed and used it
0375703764|5.0|I started and stopped this book three times until I finally finished it, and I am happy I did. Somewhat fragmented, sometimes nonsensical, twisted, and sometimes outright creepy, &#34;House of Leaves&#34; is one of the more innovative books found amongst the shelves and shelves of books at the local corporately owned-and-run bookstore. Using tricks as simple as changing text direction, spacing, or placement, forces the reader to involve himself in the book in a way few others do.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is another great read by Crisham in which he take you down a winding path of intrigue and also bringing back a couple people from A Time To Kill.
B003B02O0A|5.0|John Grisham's early novel is full of action, drama, and suspense that keeps me from throwing the book aside.  It takes a lot to occupy my interest when choosing a book and this novel is definitely the perfect solution for my interest. Something new happens with each and every chapter that keeps me reading to find out the outcome!

B0063IH60K|2.0|I enjoy playing it. It seems to be working fine and no issues. Would like that the advertisements didn't pop up every time it deals though. Then I would give it a much higher rating..
0307719774|5.0|This is such a fun way to record your thoughts daily. The book offers different questions for 365 days...with 5 spaces beneath each question for you to record your answer for 5 years. I like the various questions, and it's interesting to see what I wrote the previous year.<br /><br />I used to write lengthy journal entries with no real topic, so this helps me to be quick and to the point. It's kind of like a real life twitter account for your daily thoughts...because there's really not enough space to write more than a sentence or two.<br /><br />This would be a great gift for people who enjoy books or writing...it helps to think of a new question each day!
B007QEHQY6|2.0|As a long time Holst fan, I was delighted to get this set until I found disc 1 was a duplicate of disc 3. Fortunately, I have had the Planets for many years, on a great recording by Bernstein and the NY Phil. Also, disc 2 had Joan Jett information but fortunately the right music. Whoever put this set together should be fired. The rest of the music was great, however. I got it because I didn't have a recording of St.Paul's suite.

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This movie is not about story, character development, or romance (although it attempts to have all of those). ITS ABOUT GIANT ROBOTS BATTLING GIANT MONSTERS! Guillermo del Toro has outdone himself with both eye candy and a captivating script. Sure, even the plot itself is far-fetched, but extremely entertaining! Bring on the sequel!!!
1455525839|1.0|Just because the authors can conjure it up, doesn't mean it should go on paper.  I used to thoroughly enjoy Pendergast with all his flaws and eccentricities, but now he seems more like a super hero.  As for Corrie, why in the world should we care about her?  They developed her character to be a strong heroine that young women could aspire to, I presume.  Instead I was actually rooting for her demise.  Her silly, childish and utterly unbelievable incorrigible behavior serves little purpose, other than to annoy the reader.  Preston & Child have become more miss than hit lately.  If you are a fan of &#34;The Relic&#34; or the excellent &#34;Riptide&#34; and you think this is going to entertain you in a similar fashion, I suggest you just crack those open again and have a second read.  I really don't understand how somebody could rate this with three stars, let alone five!  I stuck it out and read the whole thing.  Do yourself a favor and don't make the same mistake.
0937381888|5.0|I plunged into extract brewing with the help of a seasoned home-brewer, but my buddy unfortunately moved away shortly after stinging me with the urge to brew beer! This book was my salvation... It gave me so much more information than I wanted, and then some!! It was still somehow not overwhelming - the more I brew, the more I look back and realize that more information is now useful!
0375703764|3.0|Its interesting in that its a different type of book.  Kind of like a mix of stream of consciousness with HTML.  However the book has three stories which are interwoven.  I have to admit I liked when you would read footnotes and then turn the page and find yourself reading the non footnotes and not recognize it for a bit.  However, its not a very entertaining read and it did not pull me in like other books I've read.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a book you will never forget; one of the best books dealing with the tragedy of Nazi Germany that I have read.  The  narration is unique, and the characters are unforgettable. It will be impossible for the movie to do this book justice; it is a must read

B00CEF014E|5.0|Solstice is a head-spinning thriller. It seriously needs to be read when you're alone with nothing around you to interrupt you because it simply is a heck of a ride.<br />I enjoyed this novel, unable to put it down. The twists, the turns had me turning the pages to the end. It is short but it doesn't disappoint. It's mayhem and gore written superbly and certainly not for those who do not appreciate the dark and intenseful tales. Loved it!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Perfect! I bought this as a gift and the receiver was very happy with it. It contains everything nicely and makes it easy to carry
B00E9ZATTY|4.0|I purchased Monsters University because my 2-year old son was obsessed with Monsters, Inc. He would repeatedly request to view it over and over again. Sound familiar for other parents? For my wife and I, this was special because Monsters, Inc. was the first movie or show that was over one hour where he would sit still and truly be watching. We knew because he remembered the characters and would try to roar for himself. Too cute.<br /><br />Given the above, we made the move to purchase Monsters University when it came out. Not surprising to say, but he loved it also and has requested seeing it again a few times since. In general though, I will say that he and we (the parents) both prefer the original to the sequel. Not atypical, but here's a few reasons why below.<br /><br />My reasons as an adult/parent that I didn't give Monsters University five-stars are as follows:<br />- The plot is much more formulaic than the original. There are still some twists and turns, but it was pretty obvious for the most part what was going to happen. The (partial spoiler alert) &#34;Scare Games&#34; seemed to be a common way to go through successive challenges, like any other movie or even video game.<br />- Most of the characters were more cliche in terms of college; the jocks, the cheerleaders, the nerds, etc.<br />- For whatever reason, I felt the jokes were more original/crisp in the first<br />- Inconsistencies with story from original; see below.<br /><br />Some inconsistencies (also spoiler alert):<br />- It still wasn't very clear why Randall would eventually become so mean to Mike in the original, given they were roommates in college. Most of his battles/gripes seemed to be against Sully moreso than Mike.<br />- In the original, Mike says he knew Sully since the 4th grade (or something to that effect); but he clearly just meets him at University in the sequel.<br /><br />I really don't have any gripes against the inconsistencies. I just noticed them after watching the movie a million times with my son. That's what happens to you as a parent, but I digress...<br /><br />Anyway, if your son/daughter liked the first, they will most likely like this as well. It's a fun extension of the original and does add to the background somewhat. I hope they make a third one that is not straight-to-video. Maybe we'll see Boo grown up and the laugh factory, but hard to say...million times with my son.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Although a little difficult to get into, this book was well worth the effort.  Narrated by the Grim Reaper, &#34;The Book Thief&#34; takes us back in time and immerses us solidly in Nazi Germany with a bird's eye view.  I was transported into a world of fear and wonder, a world dominated by a charismatic dictator who embodied evil then and now.  This book reminded me of the horrors perpetrated on our world by evil men, and the power of the spoken and written word to overcome those horrors.  This is a definite must read.

B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|The extended edition is very much in the same vein of how the Lord of The Rings extended edition blu rays were done. The big difference being the movie is only on one disc instead of being spread between two discs. I am not sure what the theatrical edition of the movie had for a run time, but the extended edition clocks in at just over 3hrs (10 min or so of which are credits).<br /><br />Like Lord of the Rings, they are splitting the book up into 3 movies. This tells the story up to the orc battle in the woods before the group gets back to the Dwarven city, where of course the dragon awaits. The beginning of the movie starts out somewhat slowly, but does bring back Elijah Wood and Ian Holm to reprise their roles in sort of a lead up to Frodo meeting Gandalf in Fellowship. Then the movie flashes back to the events of The Hobbit, with Martin Freeman doing a wonderful job in the role of Bilbo.<br /><br />While the main story revolves around Bilbo and the Dwarves, we do get to see some of the characters from the LOTR films throughout the movie. The three main sequences in the film for me were the escape from the Goblins, the battle with the Orcs toward the very end of the film, and Bilbo's encounter with Gollum where of course the Ring is found. There is, of course much more than that in the movie, but those were the standout moments to me.<br /><br />The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray. If you do get the extended edition, like with the LOTR discs, there are two appendices discs which have about 9 hrs of bonus material spread pretty evenly between them. The one drawback to those is that the discs are not set up to allow you to stop and pick up where you left off. So you either have to watch all 4 plus hours of material straight through, or watch each section one-by-one. It is a relatively minor issue, but could be a pain for those who do like to go through the bonus material<br /><br />Basically, .like the LOTR extended editions, this is pretty much for hardcore fans. If you are lukewarm to the movie or just kind of a casual fan there is not really a big reason to shell out the extra money for these. But if you want to get the most movie and bonus material available then you will get more than enough here to keep you happy.fans.

B00DQAM5LI|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold never disappoints. This is a return to the old school hard rock genre executed perfectly. Not a bad track on the whole disc.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I only recently (within the past year) discovered Dream Theatre and they have become my favorite band of all time. The music is nothing short of phenomenal. Every track is outstanding - not a &#34;B&#34; side on the whole disc. You will not be disappointed.

B001E75QGG|3.0|I want to be a bit more charitable than some other reviews. Thing is, if this wasn't an Indy film, it would be a perfectly serviceable and fun movie. Not one of the greats, sure, but decent. The problem comes when you stack it up against the near flawless original trilogy, it just can't stand up to them in terms of plot, or indeed peril. It never truly feels like Indy is in any real danger, or that the stakes are high.<br /><br />BUT. It's great to see Indy and the gang back onscreen and on balance, I'm glad they did come back as there is a lot of fun to be had here. Just don't let those expectations get too high.
0393330435|1.0|1.  I've been an Apple user since the Powerbook 100 series and after reading the Steve Jobs biography, I thought I would check out this book.  There's no doubt the Steve Wozniak is a genius in the cpu world, but this is and has to be a book review and as such, the guy simply cannot write a compelling book.  It's not surprising that the book reads as if... Steve Wozniak wrote it;  ie overly mind numb boring with excessive detail... I mean mind numb.  I couldn't get beyond the initial chapters where he's talking about some grade school science project he did.  I know it's important to him... but again, this is a book review and what a serious bore.<br /><br />2.  Thus to all normal people out there, you can admire Steve Wozniak the cpu genius, but skip this book if you tend not to live on the tail end of the genius part of the bell curve.

For the price, I'm thinking about buying one or two more for stocking stuffers for Christmas!

1609611543|5.0|I cannot even begin to tell you how much of a difference this books has made in my and my mates lives this year! while reading it we eliminated all grains and actually went WAY farther than dr davis suggested (we were also reading dr furhmans books at the time) so for a while I was feeling pretty scared that I could not ever safely eat ANYTHING! (again) based on the info in both bodies of work it was becoming really clear to me and my mate that the food chain is... tainted ( to put it lightly!)<br /><br />that said, after I few months of getting settled into the new way of eating and the mind fog lifting !!! (that helped probably the most I am certain!) we pretty mush decided to go with dr davis' plan and use furhman as a further guideline for just better cleaner eating all the way around.<br /><br />so now we are doing sort of a combination of both, tot the best of our ability, the summer was easy with all the farmers markets in our area, but because we live in a northern climate, now that winter is upon us, we are using more meat and cheese(y) sorts of things to eat and as long as I take it slow and keep up with my probiotics all is well.<br /><br />this book is a life affirming GOD SEND.

B00479SVBU|3.0|I had high hopes for this unit. When it is tuned to a truly clear FM band, the signal is good and quite clean. But that can be hard to find.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|This is a controversial production, but I love it. Kaufman and Westbroek provide one of the hotest love duets ever recorded in the first act of Walkyre. Voigt is pretty good in Goetterdaemmerung, but I'm not a fan of her work in the other two. She has since announced that she'll no longer sing the role, which is a good choice. The first two operas, conducted by Levine, are more musically satisfying in their interpretation -- I find Luisi's leadership somewhat sterile. All in all, this is an essential Ring in my collection.
031623480X|5.0|Many of us know about the devastation wheat and other glutens create—but how many knew it could cause dementia?<br /><br />The author, a holistic MD (neurologist) and fellow of the American college of Nutrition—educates us on the gluten-brain connection and gives us a multitude of reasons to give up our daily bread. He’s healed patients with all sorts of neurological disorders, including MS, ADHD, migraines, Tourette’s syndrome, epilepsy, and more, by simply getting them to go gluten-free. (My favorite is a 75-year-old man who no longer needs Viagra!)<br /><br />Gluten (which is the Latin word for “glue”) breaks down to polypeptides that bind to the brain’s morphine receptor and produce an addictive high. Manufacturers know this and put it in everything. Fortunately, the author provides a list of glutenous grains as well as the gluten-free ones, and a list of other foods and ingredients that contain gluten. Even many personal care products often contain this sinister ingredient! (The book contains a web site where we can get gluten-free ones.)<br /><br />The author goes into detail as to why low carb is best, discussing insulin, leptin, depression from sugar, etc. I was amazed to learn that a piece of bread has a higher GI (glycemic index) than a Snickers bar, a banana, and a tablespoon of white sugar!<br /><br />The book also goes into detail about the cholesterol scam to increase sales of the statin drug, and cites studies that low cholesterol is harmful, causing depression that can lead to suicide. In fact, eating cholesterol has little effect on our blood cholesterol. But we nonetheless need the dietary stuff to get our needs met. People with high cholesterol levels live longer—though not in the case of excess sugar in the diet, which damages the LDL cholesterol. (Perhaps this is why cholesterol gets a bad rap—when it’s really the carbs to be blamed!)<br /><br />Though I have read dozens of books on the topic of low carb and grain-free (even wrote one myself), I learned a few surprising facts. One is that exercising the body protects your brain more than exercising the brain! Exercise increases BDNF (brain derived neurotropic factor) which enhances the brain. In fact the book even describes a theory that exercise increased our brain size from that of other mammals.<br /><br />The book goes into detail on numerous topics such as ketones, a ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting, and much more. One page is full of blood tests he recommends. A sample menu for one week is provided.  It has some very good recipes at the end in which the author simply substitutes Paleo-friendly foods for the less healthful post-agricultural ones.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to many friends and family members. The scientific studies cited are enough to convince everyone. I wish more doctors were like Dr. Perlmutter.<br /><br />Susan Schenck, award-winning author of  Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn't Workwrote one myself), I learned a few surprising facts.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|I'm a medical student from the medical school that Dr. Alexander attended who also does neurological research so I was naturally interested.  The thing immediately read as the sort of dribble that a top notch neurosurgeon wouldn't have time to write unless he was down and out.  If you read the recent esquire piece on the whole thing you will see what I mean.  Got about halfway done and could tell that a lot of this was built up as a ridiculous story.<br /><br />I have been fascinated with NDEs for some time.  If you really want a good primer on them there are better resources out there such as Evidence of the Afterlife by Jeffrey Long (another MD) which is not nearly as sensational, but much more objective.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|I love this!  They did a fantastic job recreating this wonderful old album.  Their voices are beautiful!  I love how they added their own little spin on these old songs.  Everything works!  The voices, the arrangements, the choice of instruments.  Very well done!  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves Norah Jones, Billie Joe Armstrong, and the Everly Brothers.  Because when you put it all three together,  you get musical magic!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game. Continuous levels. Wonderful to play on my kindle! Giving 4 out of 5 because I feel like it's doesn't seem to &quot;crush&quot; when it is supposed to. Over all satisfied.

B00DW36G32|3.0|This was a decent movie a I do like Robert DiNero as an actor. I gave this three stars because it was a slow moving movie and a little less action than I like. However it had a good story line and was a well acted and well written movie.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I didn't enjoy this book as much as the others in the series, but it gave closure and made me glad it was over.  It felt rushed, and the author seemed a little careless with the characters. Still, for a teen book, pretty entertaining I guess?
1476734941|4.0|There is definitely not a one-size fits all when it comes to weight loss.  I am a 54-year-old female and was at my all-time high weight when I started intermittant fasting 2 days a week in March after reading this book.  I have lost 15 lbs.  It is the easiest weight I have ever lost during an adult lifetime of being moderately overweight.  I absolutely do not count calories or just eat healthy on my non-fasting days, I eat pretty much what I want and during the summer that included ice cream 5 days a week.  I do find that overall I eat less even on my regular eating days and forbidden foods aren't as compelling because I know I can eat them 5 days a week if I want to.  Also, I did not use a single recipe from this book, I devised my own meals for my fasting days (eggs, soup, Subway turkey subs, Atkins bars for instance).  The weight loss was slow for me, it has averaged out to 2 lbs. per month.  I would like to lose another 15 lbs. and if that takes another year I am fine with that, I can follow this plan for the rest of my life.  I purchased this book and it has been on constant loan-out to friends ever since.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|One of my favorite trilogy books so far. I read the first two in a day and then couldn't help but to buy the third.
0937381888|5.0|The definitive book on homebrewing.  Buy it.  I prefer it to Papazian.  You can also find the complete text online.  I still recommend buying this book.  I can't recommend keeping a laptop around on brew day, but this book, slightly elevated from the work service, will be invaluable in all of your brewing endeavors.

B0041KW076|5.0|Totally under rated album. I would say its the calm before the storm as the songs in this set as well as in it's counter part from the Capitol label are more a sit down and relax kind of music one could not help but to sing along to many of its tracks as well as to enjoy the acoustic guitars ringing throught most of the album with an adequate stereo system this one will easley put rubber soul to shame. But at a time when people were expecting screams , yea yeah yeah and all lovey dovey this came out in my opinion this is among the best Beatles album it's a perfect in between of please please me and abbey road.
0307719774|5.0|Looks lovely, and it makes a great gift but also fun to have one for myself. It is interesting to read how the answers change over the years. I think it would be more interesting for young people since their perspectives can change quite a bit over the years.
B000M06SU4|5.0|I would say its the strangest Beatle album in the market it goes from live in 64 to anthology and mixes it up and turns it around to a spectacular array of beats and sound that keeps you on your toes nothing added from the outside it's all Beatle sounds strawberry fields and while my guitar gently weeps stand out making you wonder how can you not recommend or even talk about these tracks to non Beatle fans and the list goes on

0596009208|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my TA for a graduate level programming course. I knew the basics about programming, but certain areas were very confusing to me (like abstract classes, static vs. private, threads), so I bought this book in hopes that it would help me. Head First Java cleared up EVERYTHING for me and taught me so much about Java programming! It's not your typical programming book and that's what I love about it. There are a lot of pictures, interesting puzzles and questions to check your understanding, and weird/funny anecdotes. It doesn't take itself seriously, but it will seriously teach you something about Java in an entertaining and unconventional manner. I would absolutely recommend this book for beginners through intermediate level programmers.

0470876417|5.0|Over the last decade I have spent a considerable amount of resources and time in the hope of creating business models that interpret and mould to what we do as a business. This meant I was paying for the time of experts (drips under pressure), like accountants pretending to be 'business advisers', who really did not understand 'what we did exactly or the depth of the service/product set on offer'. It wasn't until I got a old school service orientated &#34;methods engineer&#34; in for advice, that my life changed, first he studied what we did, breaking it down and get dirty in our processes; and the second thing he did, was to educate to change our mindset. This book was part of the mindset change we engaged in. Today, our business is a very different beast, I am not going to claim we are successful, but I can claim that we are streamlined, that we have a business model that is flexible and grows cooperatively with us. I cannot recommend highly enough the value and benefit that you will gain from this book and the community around it.

From the first page i was hooked, and I couldnt put it down! I HAD to know what was going to happen next!! More than once, while i was reading I had to stop and say &#34;WHAT?!&#34; because it took a twist i didnt expect!  By far the best book of the series, I literally felt exhausted when i read the words &#34;the end&#34;. About 90% of the way through the book I became anxious because I wasnt sure how this story was going to end, but Suzanne Collins ended it beautifully, and I loved the way it ended! I actually want to read it again!

B00ECR7KX2|5.0|It's so fun to see this play done in so many ways, especially this way.My husband and I loved this. After renting this movie we purchased it to add to our permanent collection. We have seen Much Ado many times in many ways. It's fun to see familiar actors and directors do unfamiliar works. Reed Diamond was especially good in his role but all of the actors were natural and funny. This was a dream of Joss Whedon's and I'm so glad he did it. Not to mention the cover of Hey Nonny Nonny is beautiful! Must see for fans.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book! It's very well written. It's sad, yet has bits of humor. John Green really makes you love the characters and feel for them.

B000LPS3B2|4.0|I watcher the American remake of this fllm last year and finally got a chance to give this one a try.  It was quite enjoyable.  While I knew the how's and why's after watching the remake, it was still fun to watch this unfold.  And I had people over over who were not familiar with the story, and they also liked the film.  This is not an in-your-face horror film, so if you like those kinds, this won't be for you.  However, if you a fan of the Japanese horror films, such as Ringu, you should find this one enjoyable, too.  NIcely done.
0783117523|5.0|good flick
0060574216|4.0|This is empowering and enlightening!  I have been married for 14 years and I wish I would have read this as a newlywed.  I would have learned so much quicker how to effectively communicate with my husband without so much trial and error.  I could have benefited from setting limits on how much I give and asking and expecting more support from my husband.  I thought it was amusing to recognize myself in some of the true-to-life scenarios like waiting out my husband for him to do the dishes…and he never noticed.  We are wired differently and I was in denial thinking he just didn’t care like an insensitive jerk.  I learned way too late in marriage to be direct with him and ask for what I want otherwise he will never know.  I built up resentment and he had no idea what hit him when I finally told him how I felt.<br /><br />It has practical insights that will give me more confidence in my relationship with my husband and others.  I can even understand so-called irrational women a little bit better because I am not as typical as they are.  I offer solutions to my husband while he needs me to just listen to feel better.  I found myself in a few role reversals in this book particularly how I go into my cave and need to think things through to figure out how to respond before I blow up while my husband wants to talk right away.  I grew up watching my parents pretend everything was okay while feelings were severely suppressed.<br /><br />I think a helpful companion book to this is “The Five Love Languages” which I read a couple of years ago.  Used together they can make relationships more meaningful.  I think this is kind of like the “Idiot’s Guide to Understanding the Opposite Sex.”  Some explanations I thought were silly and men and women overreact, and maybe they do but that is the way we are made.  For instance, I thought who cares if I ask my husband “Can you help me” instead of “Will you help me?”  Apparently it makes a big difference and I have vaguely noticed it sometimes but I thought “I am asking you, my husband of 14 years to help, just help me already dangit!  Don’t be such a baby full of pride!”  It is interesting that even though we say some of the same phrases we mean something different or understand it another way.  This book has changed my perspective in a positive way and will make my life simpler.

B00GO95TAC|4.0|I don't think people understand the rating system on here.  Granted, you are telling people about being upset at the cost, which I understand, but you should be rating the Episode not your transaction.  There are other avenues to voice complaints.<br /><br />With that being said, I enjoyed this episode quite a bit.  The reason for 4/5 rating is I expected a bit more and it seemed mostly like a longer episode of Doctor Who.  I am a huge fan and this definitely seemed fitting for a 50th anniversary episode, but perhaps a more production value would have helped push it to 5/5.  Definitely worth it for fans at any price but those less devoted might wait until the 50th Anniversary hype is over.

B006YTTVHO|3.0|A step by step approach and guide to start and proceed with a conversation with known and unknown people.<br />The author is quite successful in bringing about the basic ideas, strategies and approach towards starting a conversation and keeping it live till the end. The book is divided into two parts for convenience. The first part takes the reader through the basics of developing conversation skills and the negative habits which need to be addressed to start a good conversation. The Love and Connection Daily Practice suggested by the author towards the end of the first part is very resourceful and effective. I feel that anyone who practices this 4 point formula on a daily basis is sure to be having a great day, everyday. The second part of the book elicits the most useful tips and strategies to be used in conversation. This is found to be very useful and lively with each tip being very practical and applicable to almost every individual of this world.<br />It is found that the book is mainly focused on ‘Introverts” and those who feel shy, afraid, timid and reluctant to start a conversation with strangers. Every example is compared with extroverts and social beings. The point of being social is strongly emphasized without a mention of the fact that there are also great conversationalists in introverts and poor social beings in extroverts for that matter.<br />Overall, the practical aspects discussed in the book are quite substantial and carry enough weight to influence an introvert to change his attitude towards an extrovert.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|I saw the Musical too...the movie is so much more intimate and meaningful...but I LOVED the musical too.  Please take the time to watch this movie...It is a simple theme that really isn't examined well or often in films...done masterfully.

B009AMANBA|5.0|I loved this movie and Daniel Day-Lewis really deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Actor.  He made you believe he was Lincoln with his look, mannerisms and voice.  Sally Field also play a good Mary Todd Lincoln because she studied her in depth.  I live in Lexington, Ky and she even came here to see her home here and get a feel for the kind of woman she was.....which was kind of nuts!

B00AKKS278|2.0|Let me save you some time and, whatever it's worth to you, a few dollars. Wake up in the morning, meditate, tell yourself positive things, and exercise. Then your life will be better. Also, if you want to make money, take some common sense advice and build a fluffy pamphlet book around it. Make sure to buy a ton of raving Amazon reviews and tie in as much cross-marketing and merchandising as possible. Sigh.
B00E257S86|3.0|Chances are, you’re reading this review on an example of disruptive technology. An iPhone or other smartphone. An iPad or a notebook computer. Or simply a laptop. Every one of these devices turned its industry upside down when it was introduced, driving established companies to the brink of insolvency, or even into oblivion, and paving the way for new actors to enter the landscape.<br /><br />Today, almost instinctively, we understand the concept of disruptive technology. But it wasn’t until after the publication in 1995 of an article by Clayton Christensen in the Harvard Business Review entitled “Disruptive technologies: catching the wave” that the term entered the language. That seminal article was followed in 1997 by Christensen’s pathfinding book, The Innovator’s Dilemma – one of the most influential business books of all time.<br /><br />Christensen, a long-time professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, had found an answer to a question that had long mystified the business community: why had such iconic, well-managed firms as Digital Equipment Corporation, Xerox, and dozens of others that had long led their industries fallen by the wayside? The professor’s answer was not that they had simply gotten behind technologically but that they had done everything right — listening carefully to their best customers and catering to their needs by investing in sustaining technologies that offered customers added value. The problem was that the dictates of prudent business practice prevented them from investing in the sort of innovation that could turn their own industries upside down: disruptive technologies. In fact, Christensen wrote, “the only instances in which mainstream firms have successfully established a timely position in a disruptive technology were those in which the firms’ managers set up an autonomous organization charged with building a new and independent business around the disruptive technology . . . There is something about the way decisions get made in successful organizations that sows the seeds of eventual failure.”<br /><br />A decade and a half ago this was a shattering insight and it explains the acclaim that Christensen’s work has received throughout the world of business. However, if you turn to his book, The Innovator’s Dilemma, in search of deeper understanding of these concepts, you may be disappointed. I was.<br /><br />Sadly, this book is organized and written in a style that reeks of old-fashioned academia. Chapter One, an introduction of sorts, sums up the book as a whole — in 26 tedious pages, explaining in detail what the reader will find, chapter by chapter. First, Chapter One briefly outlines what the book will reveal, then proceeds to repeat each point in detail. Then, as though that isn’t enough, each chapter repeats the same points, adding considerably more detail. The final chapter repeats each of the major points — again. The repetition is maddening. And so is the overuse of the passive tense, which abounds throughout. Compounding the problem are the long-winded explanations of such things as how disk drives work and the distinction between thin-film technology and ferrite-oxide technology in disk drives’ read/write heads. All this material, no doubt necessary to “prove” Christensen’s thesis to his academic peers (some of whom are still not convinced), gives the book the charm and box-office appeal of a PhD dissertation about the influence of the Greek concept of the soul in 13th Century French literature.<br /><br />If all you want is to get to the meat of this book and avoid slogging through endless detail about matters only an engineer could love, read the first chapter and the last one. Forget the rest. You’ll thank me.way decisions get made in successful organizations that sows the seeds of eventual failure.”<br /><br />A decade and a half ago this was a shattering insight and it explains the acclaim that Christensen’s work has received throughout the world of business.

B00G21YLF6|4.0|I bought An Adventure in Time and Space, it would have gotten the most stars possible except for:  the casting of the 2nd doctor.  this actor looked as much like Patrick as I do.  just slapping a black pageboy wig on someone wasn't good enough.  and what on EARTH was Matt Smith doing there?  that was rather silly and horribly out of place.  otherwise the casting was superb, the writing was excellent and the story interesting.
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|This book doesn't have the answers to success. It challenges you to see in a different way and stop giving yourself excuses.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|This is a fun little game, challenging. You have to rock your device left to right back and forth to get the balls, through the holes to get to the next level, not as easy as it sounds .
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This was a series that I had no desire to watch.  I liked Bryan Cranston in Malcolm in the Middle and seeing another comedic actor trying to play in a dramatic role just seemed been done before.  After hearing all the rave reviews I decided to give it a try and I couldn't be more happy that I did.  This series touches a lot of emotions and allows us to justify each characters beliefs.  You can relate to Walter fighting cancer, Jesse dealing while thriving for a normal life, Hank's pursuit of the unsolvable case, their families getting sucked in, and sadly enough the reasoning of the drug lord's.  At several points throughout the show you would really hate a character and later on feel sadness for them.  Why was I hoping for Walter to get away with his scheme or Jesse to establish a smooth running drug business?  Then throw in this jack ass lawyer Sal that actually knows what he's doing, insane?  Not at all, this is what makes this series special.  A lot of series will play up to the viewer and give you those feel good moments.  Breaking Bad stuck to each persons role, and for example I use Walter's wife.  Walter and her never really had that &#34;kissy kissy&#34; scene.  Even in the end she would not give Walter that goodbye hug.  Maybe I am being way to picky but little things like that made the show feel so real.  I was exhausted after watching an episode but like Walter's meth, I couldn't get enough and clicked on the next episode.  This is a very special series that deals with many issues we sadly deal with.  Not to mention amazing performances from the cast, this is a must view series.
0385537131|1.0|Dull, dull, dull!  I usually love his books, but can't even finish this one.  I didn't care enough about the characters to see what happened!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Love, love, love, Pendergast!!! He's the most interesting character ever! Kept me guessing throughout. Can't wait for the next one!
B0091THRCU|4.0|I am pleasantly surprised how much I like this case. I had one of those big hard plastic case that are always on display when you upgrade your phone (so of course I had to buy one). It was a good case but kinda bulky. The Snugg case is slim, stylish looking and very comfortable to slip in and out of your pocket. I would highly recommend this. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have not had the case very long and I want to see how the pull tab holds up. It is definitely worth the price as the big clumsy case I had before the Snugg cost $30.00.
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|my girls love nerf and know its girly they love it even more. cant say enough about this amazing product would buy again
B009EE1GC4|5.0|The movie is charming with likable characters who bond together through the adventures of life that land them all in a hotel in India for retired people.  It paints India as a vivid, vibrant, somewhat chaotic country with kind, enthusiastic people. It makes you want to visit!
0399161287|5.0|If you are a fan of boxing then this book is a must have read. Mike Tyson has lived a very interesting life as a true American Gladiator. Pairing up this book with the old fights on YouTube ,that are mentioned in the narrative,really made the story come alive.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Good Bond movie! Craig is managing to make us forget the first few actors who played James Bond after Connery. He can't come close to Sean Connery's appeal as the first Bond. However, he easily eclipses the others.
B008JFUS8M|4.0|I did not despise the first Hunger Games film.  I instead found it unspectacular through and through, a neither-here-nor-there cinematic experience to be placed in the second or third tier of action and science-fiction films focused on the potential end of the world and/or futuristic totalitarian governments.  With a new director, a larger budget, and an expanded ensemble cast, however, the second film, Catching Fire, represents a vast improvement, and I am now invested in the storyline of the franchise and its bow wielding heroine, played again with convincing angst and agility by Jennifer Lawrence.<br /><br />The past credits of Austrian born American director Francis Lawrence include a long, long list of music videos (for artists such as Green Day, Jay Z, Lady Gaga, and Third Eye Blind) and entertaining, if unmemorable films with a great deal more visual power than depth, including Constantine and I Am Legend.  So he is without a doubt more of a pro gun-for-hire than a genius-in-waiting, but he shines in this particular context, delivering the overcast atmosphere and dawn-of-a-revolution scope required to give this YA adaptation a genuine grit and spirit of involving unease.  With design choices and details both small (blood stains on the snow-white suit of a Capitol soldier) and large (the foreboding, overheated, Joseph Conrad ready jungle environment where the titular murder spectacle unfolds), as well as crisp and graceful camera movements, he and his behind-the-scenes team have assembled a well-designed and grimly beautiful film.<br /><br />The introduction of a few mega-talented character actors, including a charming, nerdy Jeffrey Wright and an icily competent Philip Seymour Hoffman, is another welcome pleasure of the film, though, unfortunately, neither the wooden Josh Hutcherson nor the studly, but largely absent Liam Hemsworth are able to match the magnificent Jennifer Lawrence and truly ignite the film's Twilight style, teen friendly love triangle.  Asa bid to tell a story of youthful love and coming-of-age amidst the turbulence of revolution, the Hunger Games saga still comes up a tad short, but at least the revolution itself is now ablaze.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Every! SONG! IS GREAT!  I love this whole album, and his last one for that matter. I dont have to skip a single song.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love puzzles and I wish you would put more of the Big Fish puzzles on there to buy and download or for free.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Janelle is a very unique and creative artist.  This CD is sure to keep your body moving and head banging!!!!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|The names were difficult to pronounce.  Very slow read. I liked the movie more.  The music which made it more enjoyable.  Exodus had this beat.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Chris Pine did an excellent job as Kirk showing different sides of the character.  Pine can play various emotions with ease and gave life to a character that could easily be made wooden by many other actors. Chris and Zachary Quinto understood the relationship between Kirk and Spock.  Chris and Zachary were successfully able to underscore the fondness that Kirk and Spock have for each other despite Spock's limitations for human emotions.  The profanity could have been a little less and added nothing since these characters are supposed to be highly educated and evolved.
B003TY3F06|4.0|Perfect film with an all-star cast, except for the always annoying Christian Slater.  Wonderful otherwise. Arquette, Oldham, Walken, Pitt are outstanding.
B00003CX96|5.0|A coming of age story that is timeless even though it was filmed many years ago. Filmed entirely in the Bloomington, Indiana, area, it tells the story of Dave Stoller, a local kid who can't seem to make up his mind about what to do after high school. He is passionate about cycling and the story revolves around it. You will not be disappointed in this film.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book gives the reader the ability to see how life was in that horrible date in time through the innocence of a child. Amazing story..
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|In the end he had the integrity to own up to his problems and did not let the innocent airline attendant take the fall for him. The acting was outstanding.
B0036TGT2A|4.0|Some 3D is iffy, but the movie was remastered very well and is still one of the greats. If they could fix a few 3D issues it would be 5 stars
B002MQYOFW|4.0|What a beautifully written and heart wrenching book. Loved the survival aspect of it, and living off the nature which was provided.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I wanted something small and light that I could carry with me; this fits the bill.  Surprisingly hard-working dfor such a small tool.  Highly Recommend.
B00000K3CR|5.0|This is one of Tom Hanks' best acting jobs. He portrays a child transformed into an adult by a bit of magic. It is funny and delightful to watch Hanks act like a 12 yr old while being an &#34;adult&#34; in every one else's eyes.
0812550706|3.0|A great moral deconstruction of this story is the essay titled &#34;Creating the Innocent Killer&#34; by John Kessel.  The only point of morality where I have any agreement with the author is that there is such a thing as justifiable homicide.  There is a twist at the end that is a huge payoff for anyone who has read through the story without seeing the movie.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|Bought the amplifier for my 97 year old aunt who is extremely hard of hearing. She now can listen to television with earbuds and hears everything clearly, while the television is at a normal volume, not blasting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fantastic. Easy way to pass time and great for all ages. New content and maps all the time so it never gets boring. Love this game!
B00G6ZTM3Y|2.0|While I'm sure it would be a good game, I am rating it one star because I cannot begin the installation process. I would warn people of this before they buy your product.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I had mixed feelings when I initially rented this movie. The trailers had me curious. Just finished watching it and I was shockingly surprised. It's very predictable, but what comedy isn't.  The supporting cast really nailed it. I felt it was worth the rental.
B000QE9ERK|4.0|The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 was the way it ended..it leaves you wondering what happened to him?
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this rating because it had some action and I actually like action. And also I was surprised about the end to but I bet mockingjay it's going to be a good book though. Well I liked this book because like I said there was action and they have really good descriptions of the jungle and the time zones.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|To write from the viewpoint of animals shows a great understanding of all their places in the circle of their environment.  Rudyard Kipling was an amazing storyteller.
B000002UB3|5.0|Classic Beatles, good listening and worth the update to vinyl - even for non-Beatle Lovers! Should be part of a good library
B0004Z33F0|3.0|this movie is great if you are watching the whole 4 pack of the rambo series. It is of corse, pure cheese. great when you are in the mood for pure cheesy action fun. as far as action films go, obviously any movie stallone stars in is a given. the best movie out of the 4, in my opinion, is the first one, first blood. first blood gets 5 whole stars, and in and of itself is a stand alone movie that does not need another three movies added to it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I had got this product with lot's of hope, but at the end I didn't get any benefits of buyin this product. Chromecast only helps in streaming the videos on Youtube no other sites. I have a Samsung LED Smart TV. The TV already had app for playing videos from youtube or pairing it with other devices in same network. So if you have a TV which doesn't have a app to view /stream videos then you can go for this.<br />Hope ChromeCast would add other websites in its product for us to stream the videos.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|I want my money back I played it on Pc but when I try to download it it wont leg me it saysndownload failed I want the full five bucks bavk
006202406X|2.0|I really liked this series all the way up until the very end and then it fell flat.  I was disappointed in the ending.  It was depressing.  One of the worst ending I have ever read.  It leaves the reader wondering why they invested their time reading the whole series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's loads of fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's great for all ages at my family reunion I played my mom played my grandparents played nieces and nephews played

B001AMNL2Q|5.0|uh, stanley kubrick, duh.....and one of the top 100 american movies made. A must have for anybody who likes movies.
B003UESJEM|4.0|This film makes a significant statement about corporate morals or lack thereof and how corporations view as acceptable the devaluing and discarding of the men and women whose life's blood made them what they are while only caring about the bottom line and shareholder interests. It begs the question of whether it is enough to merely compensate such people with mere wages and benefits, or is respect and honor, and thus the acknowledgement that their wisdom and experience make them INDISPENSABLE to a company's continued future, due as well.<br /><br />It also quite expertedly showcases the immense greed that takes place in all of these places where on the one hand the executives who sit in their cushy  400 square feet corner offices with ceiling to floor windows and mahogany desks talk about cutting down and casually and without compunction lay off thousands of people while at the same time somehow having found the funds to buy a brand new building whose entire floor they retrofit to house three hot shot executes each pulling 15 million a year in cash plus about half of that in stocks and securities. They lay off hard working, middle class mind you, folks who have put in decades and endless hours into their jobs and who have mortgages to pay, kids to send to college and lives to live while in the same breath planning their exclusive winter getaway in some luxury resort with $500 dinners and $5000 a night suites. And these very men have gotten this rich not by actually producing something, or building something tangible, but by pushing figures on a sheet.<br /><br />Too many of America's companies have gotten quite cozy with this callous arrangement whereby actual people and their lives have stopped mattering, while greed and the bottom line have fully taken over. One example in this movie is the CEO who fires his best friend (Jones) who helped him build the company from the ground, without a trace of irony and compunction and even a smile on his face because hey, &#34;business is business&#34; and apparently nothing else matters. Friendship, loyalty, devotion and honor are secondary when it comes to amassing wealth.<br /><br />Companies today seldom strive for a higher standard of value that extends beyond the dollar and this movie does a great job at showing that.<br /><br />That said, if you are into movies where for some of the characters the idea of being poor is that they are no longer multi millionaires but just regular millionaires or whose idea of being broke is that the wife cannot take the company jet to go traveling or that you may have to do the unspeakable, which is rent a townhome instead of living in an estate with 12 gardeners, then this is the movie for you. Have at it. Try feeling bad for people who went from 180k a year to half that. Try feeling bad for people who own 10 million dollar mansions, who wont be eating filet mignon and lobster every night anymore cause they got canned;  try feeling bad for people who commit suicide because they can't send their kid to a senior trip to Italy or whose monthly mortgage is just as high as one year's tuition at Brown. Try feeling really sorry for people who no longer get to start their work days at 11 because they just spent the last 3 hours on the golf course;  feel heartbroken that some rich puke had to sell his overpriced sportscar or could, god forbid, not buy his kid a 400 dollar xbox.<br /><br />I personally found it hard to feel entirely too sorry for them because real struggle post recession for many was facing card board boxes as an alternative to a home, bankruptcy, loss of their entire life savings and retirements, not to mention chronic unemployment with sustenance level unemployment insurance (which ran out),  the inability to feed their children and themselves and generally having to navigate a tedious existence stuck in trenches of destitution without any real prospects in sight, thanks to a host of middle class busting policies by both of our parties anda practically non existent soclal safety net.<br /><br />It is amazing how the architects of the Ownership Society and Hard Work  - people who carelessly assert that those who don't have everything they need just aren't trying hard enough or are lazy mooches and and who tell those very same people to &#34;live within their means&#34; -  themselves fall into a deep emotional and existential crisis when they are tasked with the unspeakable act of having to navigate life not as a semi millionaire, but as an ordinary person, and thus like hundreds of millions of others, who rent instead of owning and who drive one car instead of housing six in a garage the size family townhome. These people expect poor people to not complain about being poor and low wages, no benefits and exploitative employers, but they themselves arent even willing to LIVE even for one second with non-wealthy and, in fact, commit suicide when all the luxuries, emphasis on luxuries,  are taken away from them.<br /><br />Objectively, none of the people in this movie, even after they lost their jobs, was in such a bad shape and, in fact, they were better off than most Americans today. it's just that they no longer could spend $600 a month on dry cleaners or thousands of dollars on the country club membership.<br /><br />As mentioned above, one of the characters commits suicide because he cannot pay for his kid's tuition and his mortage at the same time and i am sitting there thinking: really? You are willing to throw your life away because your head is so high up in the clouds that you cant even CONCEIVE to oh, i dont know, maybe get a student loan for your kid and rent? You'd rather be dead than take out a student loan and rent the roof above your head? Laughable.<br /><br />Watching members of the 1% hit hard times - which really just means not living in obscene wealth they mostly cheated others out of (hence the economic meltdown), is not interesting and it does not evoke my sympathy. Yes it really isbothersome to go from a almost 200k salary to a 90k one, but not as troublesome as going from a 50k salary to 0 without a job in sight and unemployment running out. Halfway through the movie i realized that these people dont know what real struggle is. What it means to only have 5 dollars left in your checking until payday. Being poor is not for weak or lazy people, but apparently being rich is.

B00G4U7TO0|3.0|I think they should have used Fred Neil's version of &#34;Green Green Rocky Road&#34;. Listen to it if you get a chance. Incredibly soulful. In fact, listen to all of Fred Neil's songs (he wrote &#34;Everybody's Talking&#34;, and his version has much more feeling than Nilsson's cover from &#34;Midnight Cowboy&#34;). But if this movie gets young folks to listen to folk music then it's worth it. I think the CD is rather bland. Stream music on &#34;Folk Alley&#34; to listen to a variety of folk music.

B002NZTZ8S|1.0|This is a retro red & blue 3D glasses format movie. What a joke. 2013 & they are selling it as a modern 3D movie. Way to much money for this DVD. Look for blue-ray 3D when buying 3D movies. Lesson learned.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|This movie had some potential, but it wasn't as good as it could've been. They tried for the suspense and twist ending, but I just didn't care enough about any of the characters to be in suspense or surprised at the ending. It's one of those movies that seems like it should be good on paper, if you knew about the twist, but it just doesn't connect with the viewers in a way to make it good.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Great story, classic Stephen King. I know I'm never going to look at rest stops in quite the same way again!
B00FMJIF10|5.0|George Szell’s Cleveland Beethoven cycles still remains the finest set available, especially in the face of the ever-increasing mountain of period sets, historically informed performances, or cycles featuring “new” editions.  The fact of the matter is that Szell beats them all at their own game for the same reason – for Szell, musicality was the ultimate goal.  Complete orchestral discipline was not an end in itself, fleet tempos were not self-justifying, and reference for the printed score was not reverential to the exclusion of interpretation.  Rather, all served a purpose for Szell in creating the musical experience.  The orchestra’s discipline allowed Szell to showcase what he wanted to highlight, be it the monumental dissonant chords in the Eroica’s allegro, the razor sharp attacks in the Ninth’s scherzo, or the power of nature in the Pastoral.  Szell’s tempo choices remain ideal, not only in that they propel the music forward, but also because they generate the maximum amount of excitement.  The Eroica’s allegro is not so fast that it spins out of control, the fifth’s allegro never sounds mechanistic, and the finale of the Eighth (perhaps sounding old fashioned by today’s standards) takes on monumental dimensions.  And Szell never missed the opportunity to express musically Beethoven’s intensions, even if this meant tinkering with the coda of the Erioca’s allegro or reinforcing musical lines in the finale of the fifth.<br /><br />But that still in only half the story.  Szell’s interpretations are not of the disciplined, hyper-critical task-master that he is often painted as being; rather, these performance speak of a love of this music, where the Apollonian and Dionysian are hand-in-hand.  There is not a more ruckus, barbaric coda to the finale of the Eroica on disc and yet, the music still bespeaks a nobility and sublimity that few have achieved in this music.  One never finds Szell’s seriousness in the finale of the Second takesaway any of the music’s inherent humor.  By generating excitement through discipline, Szell shows how the rhythms throughout the Seventh can create moments of true musical joy.  Szell’s end goal was always letting the music speak for itself; his results were never achieved through manipulation of timbre (Karajan), manipulations of tempo (Furtwangler), or manipulations of emotions (Toscanni).  That is not to say I would want to be without these sets, or those from Klemperer, Bohm, or, more recently, Barenboim or Vanska.  But no other conductor makes you feel like you are listening to music, rather than an interpretation, like Szell does.  In short, his genius speaks for itself.<br /><br />While I applaud Sony for rereleasing this set, how frustrating it is that they do not include the entire balance of overtures and the concertos (although those are available in the separate Fleisher set), which would constitute the ultimate Beethoven collection.  Still, at this price, those that, for whatever reason, still do not own this set in one form or another should snatch this up now.
B0031RS7X6|4.0|When you take a moment and reflect on the types of little secrets we all keep, is it a wonder that occasionally we slip up! ?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Love it so much I could explode with an amazing goo out of my mushroom tip then pound till I yell
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|My boyfriend found this app for my phone to I also installed it onto my tablet and I love it !!!!
B008AIGWVA|2.0|Stupid, I returned it. Some people might like it, but I didn't. I thought the grandkids might like it. That is the only reason I bought it.
B00GIZO674|5.0|about time they finally got this app had it 4 my pc now I hav it 4 my kindle<br />plz get won't refer it
B00D23GXB2|5.0|“Revenge of the Orgasms” includes some very powerful poems that are sure to get you in the mood. If you’re not in a relationship with anyone I strongly suggest you read this book with caution because it will sure put you in the mood for some sexual healing. The author, G.P.A. touches on just about every topic (marriage, infidelity, racism, family issues, forbidden and complicated desires, hurtful experiences, grief, love, etc.) and takes you on a thought- provoking journey from the beginning when you first open the book until the every end. If you like poetry and love the erotic selections, this book aims to please with great foreplay.
0735338841|5.0|We where pleasantly surprised with these cute little pocket books. The cover is sturdy and my son loves this series.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|I have all the books and the first movie.  Absolutely loved Catching Fire in the theatre and i will buy it as soon as it becomes available.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an excellent novel, holding my attention with good writing, continuous adventure and enough psychological depth to make it a better than usual SciFi book.<br />On par with Ender's game.
B008J5G2IW|4.0|I have been looking for a suitable sandal type of outdoor shoe for a while, and saw a KEEN advert when travelling overseas.<br />Very happy with the purchase.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|There is not much I can add to other evaluations about this DVD. If you love Celtic Woman as I do this would be a great addition to your collection. I have become an avid fan of this group and there music. I can NEVER get enough of it. I highly recommend it. There is something for everyone on it.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is perfect for patience testing :P. I love it, but i see some people complaining about updates. Just restart the app. That's what i did and it worked fine. The thing i have to complain about is that when you visit &quot;Random Parks&quot; they aren't really 'Random' at all. It just takes you to 10 different ones. Other than that, i love this game and hope others get it, and enjoy it too :)
B00029D0B0|5.0|Nice model, very detailed, and the decals are beautiful. Anyone who wants to buy this model, has to be prepare to spend some time with it, because it requires a lot of effort, not for beginners.
B009NX409M|2.0|Did not even watch it all the way through.  Title would be better  'Falling in love with someone else's wife and  not honoring your marriage commitments.'
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|I really liked the free portion of this game,  although I wish it were longer,  since there is no way I am paying $5.34 for a game app. In my state,  we are taxed on electronic game apps from Amazon now.- thanks to our governor. (Sorry,  I digress.)<br />The free portion of this game is excellent,  and CONTAINS NO HIDDEN OBJECT GAMES!  YAY!<br />If the companies do not lower prices,  then they will lose in the long run,  since the avid point-and-click adventure game players will not buy them.<br />I have so many game apps of this genre,  of the 3 big companies,  and I will never pay more than $2.99 (plus tax.)<br />I don't understand how one reviewer paid $2.99 for this game. Wish I could find out.<br />If the price of this game gets lowered,  I will buy the unlock,  and update the review. Have a feeling that 's not going to happen... but will keep hoping.<br />I play on Kindle Fire 1st generation,  and had no glitches in the free part... except the price.
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|This film was so good, my husband (who never enjoys my film choices) watched it even with our son talking too much in the background.  This movie has it all, poverty, discrimination, self-reflection, two antagonists and protagonists.  Life lessons can be shared with the whole family.  I don't have to ask my 8 year old to leave the room.  Lastly, it has references to great literature.  A delightful movie that can be shared with a high school literature class, a college ethics (how I saw it) or sociology class, a course on diversity and ethics or a just a great film for the family.  It also has Sean Connery, when is that not a plus?
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|I very much like this player . I use it on my Acer tablet. The tablet is older (4 years). It's an A500. the audio and video reproduction is very good.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Love everything about this movie: the cinematography, the characters, the story....<br /><br />I must have watched the ending ten times -- beautifully played.
0062064304|5.0|Hard cover is very recommended. This book is perfect for a designer and any sci-fi aficionado. Many unknown features of the film and details.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Excellent!  Works perfectly.  With other brand it took minutes for my iphone to even recognize it was plugged in. With this it's instantaneous and both plugs work at one time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Annoyingly fun game. But watch your wallet. Lots of options for in app purchases. I have never paid to play but lots of people do. Stick with the free stuff and you will have tons of fun!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This movie was wonderful.  Pixar did it again with this one.  The first fifteen minutes with the relationship montage is far and away the best part.  It had my spouse and me both tearing up and hugging.  It also helped us explain some life truths to our elementary aged son.  movie is properly silly for young children and very mature about love, loss and the let down of our adult heroes at the end.  A great family film that engages all audiences.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I recently purchased this DVD and am thoroughly enchanted with it. As with other music, by Celtic Woman, I find the more I listen the more I love it. This DVD is easily another highly recommended purchase. The women are beautiful and their voices are angelic.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. The story of Ender kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I couldn't put it down. If you love young adult books like the Hunger Games and Divergent you'll love this book as well.
B00GWEPPE4|2.0|Along with the last episode, there is far, far too much weight given to the bad guy. Yeah we get it. He's a sociopath murderer who gets off on power and murdering. Yeah, we get it, he manipulates people to his own end, like sociopaths do. Yeah, we get it, he wants to kill all of Rick's crew because they got over on him. Yeah, we get it, he doesn't kill to protect, that's his self delusion that justifies his serial and mass murdering sprees.<br /><br />It's almost like the writers have a fascination with the sociopath mind. Perhaps it's a kind of hero worship for them. Actually, it's an indication they are relying on cheap emotional thrills rather than good, solid writing. You can tell when writers have nothing else to give: They keep repeating the same old thing in a little different way to get cheap emotional thrills from viewers, hoping they will return for, yes, more cheap emotional thrills.<br /><br />How many times will the bad guy come back? How many more innocent good people will he murder? How many more people will he torture? How many more women will he rape? Yawn, ad infinitum.<br /><br />Episode Pros: Sociopath murderer kills other sociopath murderer. +1<br />Episode cons: New sociopath murderer introduced to take the place of the old sociopath murderer, Martinez. Net sociopath gain/loss: 0<br /><br />New ideas: none<br />Interesting dilemmas: none.<br />Good strategies: none.<br />Philosophical dialog: none.<br />Relation to real life problems: none.<br /><br />Net overall literary value: NONE!
B0041G683W|5.0|This is the BEST version of Les Mis I have ever seen. Well... excepting Nick Jonas' performance as Marius. Alfie Boe, Lea Salonga & Samantha Barks make the perfect Jean Valjean, Fantine & Eponine. The diction of Javert was flawless. Thanks for a quick and easy transaction. Would recommend!
B00FQPHA0M|4.0|As someone who loves overdone, cartoonish destruction, this movie definitely delivers.  It may have been a bit long, and the final battle with General Zod was a bit of overkill, but I prefer this finish to the original Christopher Reeve Superman 2 ending, which was very anticlimactic, in my opinion.  As to how the battle ends between Superman and Zod, I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it,  but I don't have a problem with how it was done, unlike many people on the internet.  The problems I have with this movie are minor.  I like Henry Cavill as Superman, despite the occasional strange facial expressions he exhibits.  There's implausible things that happen, such as Jor-El's consciousness being able to teach Lois how to change Kal-El's original ship into a singularity (which conveniently happens off-screen), but again, as in all comic-based movies, you have to check your reality at the door.  The score is excellently handled by Hans Zimmer, and it definitely stirs the emotions in spots throughout the movie.  To make a long story short, the movie's not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination,  but it's definitely worth the purchase, having already viewed it twice on my Kindle Fire HD, with many more to come, I'm sure.
055357342X|2.0|It is a shame when reading any work of fiction or non-fiction becomes a chore. Sadly, this is the case with A Storm of Swords. I want to enjoy the book, but plowing through the endless text is more a war of attrition than something a reader might enjoy.<br /><br />I was warned by other people who have read the third volume in the series about the number of characters killed off in this book. I found this to be a very annoying decision on Martin’s part. Why invest so much time effort in making some of these characters a major part of the narrative (Robb), only to have them die in what is sometimes a pretty arbitrary way.<br /><br />Martin should have borrowed from Tolkien, with whom I often see him compared, by shortening his list of heroes. This would have reduced the size of the book and created a bigger bang for the buck in the event one did die
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I do not like the Mahjong that comes with Windows 8, so I was very happy to see this app that I could play on my Kindle Fire.  It has most of the game from Window 7 and I am enjoying it!
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Well done British miniseries focuses on the machinations of a ruthless politician.  He could even have been American! (See recent attempt to duplicate series success with Keven Spacey on HBO.)
B0043RSE2M|5.0|...this movie is so darn cute. The 3D is done well, especially in certain parts (and the Blu-ray menu too!). The only weak point in this movie is Steve Carrell as Gru, the main character/bad guy. His accent is so terrible that it is just bad bad bad. The redeeming thing is the animation and the Minions. This movie had me laughing even in repeat viewings. A must-have for any 3D nut like me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have enjoyed the app for a long time. I showed it to my 94 year old dad and he loves it too.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I have been looking for a new building game to play.This one meets my needs.. It has the usual difficult &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; to obtain..As well as the appeals to buy stuff with $ but they are not obnoxious about it.. It is a keeper for me. I rate it on par with Bakery Story..
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love the game especially running alongside the bakery story to. Just play and enjoy. Easy to understand and control is so.Please by using a clock.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Good read. A real intense portray of apocalypse. Awesome if you like the walking dead. Well worth the money for it.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Initially I wasn't sure that I was going to enjoy reading this book because it was narrated from the perspective of &#34;death&#34;. That was a bit strange and took some time to get used to but once I was able to accept that issue I enjoyed reading the story.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|3D has never, EVER been done better-never. This movie is incredible. A must-have for any 3D or sci-fi fan! James Cameron knocked it out of the park on this one. Sigourney Weaver does a great job playing a cranky scientist-a role only she could have done. You'll be happy if you buy this movie!
030758836X|5.0|Every time I thought I had the plot figured out, it took another turn.  The story is written in alternating point of views from the two main characters - this is the only book I've read where I've skipped a chapter (character) to see what was going to happen next!  Pure roller coaster of a book that I couldn't put down!
B0041KVZ18|5.0|It came to me before the date listed. The album was in perfect condition. It plays excellent and the still shots and poster will be a nice addition to my wall. Thanks!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|You can play games, talk to friend, and look at pictures. If you have a family member far away from you, can talk to them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A fun but addictive game.  I only wish you got a full set of lives each time you complete a level.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is way better than the original deer Hunter. I wish that there could be more upgradeable items like a person, but other than that, it is awesome!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Great movie. Great visuals/special effects Great acting! Any movie with Tom Cruise + Morgan Freeman is a must-watch. This movie has elements of other sci-fi movies however in my opinion it pulls them all together. The soundtrack by M83 is one of the best movie soundtracks I've ever heard. A must-have for any die-hard sci-fi fan!
006202406X|1.0|The first two books were fantastic, inspiring and powerful. So of course we were sucked into the Divergent world. No one (that I can see) is saying the first 2 books aren't amazing. We are saying by writing 2 Amazingly fantastic books we got duped.. DUPED!! into reading the third totally CRAPPY one. The ending wasn't the only bad thing the story was rushed and I had to keep looking back at the chapter page to see whose pov it was in. *Spoiler*And then all is fine with Tobias and is Mom. The epic manipulating witch gets the Happy Ending. There is a fine line between being selfless and being a doormat. Ugh! Crappy.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Beautiful fun movie with good music and characters.  Don't watch a kid who you don't want to address issues of war or sexism ;) Think to yourself: do I want to explain to my child why Mulan being dressed as a man is punishable by death?
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I Love Columbo....A true american icon... I watched this show religiously and was sad when it was discontinued.  Now I get to watch it anytime I want.....Break out the popcorn and watch him in action....
B00CH87HF4|1.0|I really enjoyed playing this game until the latest update. Since then the Wheel of Fate feature has been inaccessible, it just appears as a ghosted out icon on the world map with a red exclamation mark. I have repeatedly uninstalled and reinstalled the game. I have totally shut down then opened up my kindle fire HD. Nothing fixes the problem. I'm likely to just abandon playing this game because of this frustrating problem.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I didn't finish it because it's just not that entertaining. My young adult stepson loved it, though. I prefer David Sedaris.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Great movie, decent plot. Few elements were not very smart (Really? You're going to take your helmet off? Really? You're going to pet the alien snake?!) but overall a good addition to the ALIEN(S) anthology. The 3D could have been better as it doesn't seem to have as much depth as I'd have liked (and it was even filmed in 3D?!). Interesting story about how our planet started. I wonder if the truth is something close to this? :)
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Funny, funny, funny. The cast was perfect, and it's so true to meeting people while traveling in real life! Well done!
B000KIPT30|5.0|Once again, Behringer out does themselves, producing a quality piece of audio equipment at a low cost. I've been using this unit for about a month now, and it is totally awesome! I'm using it for kind of an odd purpose... I'm splitting a stereo audio signal from my computer out into multiple lines in order to be fed into a 60W 5.1 speaker system. It gives me the ability to control the levels of Center, Left, Right and Bass all separately, and so far, I've almost never had to turn any knobs past 1/2 way. No buzz, no nothing. Totally awesome headphone amp here, convenient size, highly recommended!
B008JFUPOY|5.0|How can anyone not love these characters.  A must buy for anyone young or old or in between.  What a wonderful way for a family to enjoy an evening complete with children popcorn grandma grandpa etc...xxxx
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love &#34;subway surfers&#34; because it is so fun to play, and also because you get to collect coins and get different characters. One reason why I think other people should play this game is because it is a game that can keep you entertained.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I could not put this book down. An excellent book for anyone who likes a twist on age old vampires. An excellent book.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|...three words: Frakking Cylon Toasters. This series is the best television ever done. Period. The characters, story arcs, interpersonal relationships, space battles, Cylons (toasters), drama, angst, acting by the stars, epicness of the plot-everything in this series is what you would want. The box set is well done and well thought out. The quality of the Blu-Ray discs' picture is incredible. BSG has never looked better. Forget what you remember about the original series-this blows that out of the sky (or space). If you like amazing sci-fi OR, even better, a character-driven/focused show (that just happens to take place in space) then THIS is the show and box set for you!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I loved it but when I got my kindle fire I couldn't move my game over so then it wanted me to start over and I lost interest so don't play anyone
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very good , kept my attention..can't wait to see the movie. I recommend this book for everyone to read it.
B004G600A4|5.0|Received the DVD in the time allowance promised.  The case is in good condition and the DVD plays well. I'm Happy!  Oh yes, and the price was good, too!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Great reading, it took a slight detour to me, however I really enjoyed<br />Great thought was placed on the areas involved
B00005RFAI|5.0|i love a few songs on this pink c.d. i just had to have it thank you very much!!! it's great!!
B00CTT9646|5.0|Great value for the price! Packaging was well done. The phaser is incredibly well done. The movie disc had a flaw in it and Amazon shipped me out a replacement with no fuss. The second blu-ray had no problems. This is a must-have for any Star Trek fan! :)
B000W8HC8I|4.0|Crazy story, not one for the faint of heart, but one folks in the industry can appreciate and somewhat relate to.  Can't wait for the movie...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is really fun to play and it is very easy to connect to Facebook and see the progress of your friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the little apps that are really really really really really really really really really cool the i had this version of minecraft before i had<br />The PC version and i thought it was amazing so awesome  i once thought this game was boring but when i played the game i can't stop playing it why are you still reading this? Your wasting your time go go go get it now now nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Great product. Our son no longer loses his paci in the middle of the night!! We are all sleeping a little better
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book. It is a different kind of love story.  I couldn't put it down. I'm already on the last book. Great read.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|The song is very catchy.  It makes you feel good and it makes  me want to sing  and clap along.
B000HF6XPY|4.0|Classic Arnold! When Arnold was making headlines for Conan, this little movie was lost in the shuffle. If you love Conan The Barbarian, you will love this little movie.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|This movie has everything..humor. sadness. understanding.longing. I didn't want it to end.<br />AND the fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My first device I bought from Amazon was defective and I decided to give it another try because I heard soon you will be able to mirror your phone to your tv. So i went to best buy and picked up another one and Im glad I did. My previous one had audio issues and this one works perfectly. Setup is easy, just plug it in and run the setup from your computer or mobile device. You are connected withing 5 minutes and start enjoying streming perfect quality video and audio from these supported apps or chrome browser: Vevo, Red Bull.TV, Songza, Plex, PostTV, Viki, Avia, and RealPlayer Cloud, Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu Plus, Pandora, YouTube, Google Play Movies, and Google Music.<br />Developers everywhere are developing new apps for crhomecast. This cheap little device has a lot of potential and will continue to grow. This is a must have simply because of the price and soon it will be a must have for its features.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Great plot twists and varied interpersonal relationships.  Varied situations in each show.  Excellent in almost every way.  Almost because I wish writers hadn't succumbed to having the characters move in together.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game. It's not the most exciting thing but it is a good time passer. Try it out.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Good story with enough twists to keep one interested and it is always nice to find out about a bit of history.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|this movie is awesome! so many good laughs. If you are thinking about it, just watch it...super funny. It really surprised me. Ive seen it like three times now. Still makes me laugh
B00AWKZSNM|5.0|I have owned this device for a few months now and it is great for car trips with the kids. No more fights about who watches what.  Put your movies on a flash drive or portable drive (one that does not require an external power source) and each device can browse the file system and pick and choose which file to view (or listen to should you put music on as well)  Do remember to plug it in though if using for an extended amount of time because with heavy use the battery goes fast.<br /><br />I have thrown pretty much the kitchen sink at this thing, connecting four devices at once: iPad Mini, Nexus 7, Galaxy SIII and an iPod Touch all viewing different videos from a usb flashdrive and it did not stutter once. Very impressive.  The device creates it's own wireless network that each device connects to. That being said, there is the caveat that once connected to the iUSB Port you can not connect to another wireless network thus you are unable to receive email, browse, etc. but if you are actively engaged in consuming media content that is not a serious issue.  There is the option to connect the device to a wireless network and connect to it that way but I have not experimented with that much. I do have some issue with the software used to browse files on the connected storage device.  It is pretty rudimentary and could use a bit of polishing.  It can be cumbersome to use if you have a lot of files on the attached storage device.  However, there are some third party apps on both the Google Playstore and the Apple Appstore that work with the device. I would suggest trying out a few of those if the companion software does not meet your needs or expectations.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little device that can expand the storage and content available to portable devices (and laptops) exponentially. I have successfully attached a 1TB portable drive with no issues.  It is great for situations where you may have multiple people wanting to access content from one source individually.  The iUSB Port has worked very well for me.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this app it's really cool how it's like temple run but 10x better the only thing I would suggest is being able to collect gru coins instead of going on face.book to get stuff I am 13 and don't have a Facebook account so that c would be improved but over all its really cool and fun
