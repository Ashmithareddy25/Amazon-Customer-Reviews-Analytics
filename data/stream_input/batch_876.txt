B001G1ACVY|5.0|Awesome set! I especially like the extended play CD and live concert DVD, which is 1 1/2 hours long. The price was a steal for 2 CDs and a DVD.
B00000JZI9|5.0|If you are looking for a very entertaining western, it's hard to top this one. It's fairly long at 134 minutes, but the deep cast and always-interesting story make the time fly by.  It also looks great on DVD and I assume would be super if someone would come out with this on Blu-Ray.    There are four main \\"good guys\\" that are played by well-known actors: Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner and Danny Glover. I especially liked Kline as \\"Paden\\" with his gentlemanly manner about him and Glenn's voice always makes him interesting. Costner is so young looking he almost looks like a teenager.    Brian Dennehy, as the villainous \\"Sheriff Cobb,\\" is verbally restrained in here, which was nice to hear, for a change but he's still intense and fascinating. (This movie marked the 10,000th time Hollywood made a lawman the villain since the 1960s).    The story is fun, a straight cowboy movie with no romances or gratuitous sex scenes thrown in and has the usual beautiful western scenery and photography. The only problem was the sound. The soundtrack is so loud so have to crank up your center speaker to hear the dialog over the music.
0743487486|3.0|I wouldn't claim that this is his best work until now, but this tiny book of his actually managed to give layperson especially parents (those who do not specialise in psychology)a glimpse of how our behaviors can affect our children, argued in scientifically-relevant ways using many of the research available. For those who are into psychology, this book enhances your knowledge, gives new perspectives, and making an arguement against reward (which effect is less frequently discussed in parenting books or psychology literature).
1423113497|5.0|Wonderfully fun read.  Clever weave of how the Greek gods still fit into modern day and recent history.  Characters will capture the imagination of young adults and still be interesting for the older folks. Teachers this is an amazing way to teach mythology.  Better than any teachers \\"edition\\" or \\"help\\" book.  Your students will REMEMBER the intracies of Greek mythology and the iconic use of these characters in our culture.
B00067BBSC|5.0|After youtubing the videos and hearing their great performances, I decided to buy the DVD. The video production is excellent, with amazingly high definition. Great lighting, camera work, and of course, with Porcaro producing, the sound mix is top notch. All those boys can still ROCK!
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I enjoyed this fun and modern take on P&P.  Watching it is a great way to spend an evening when you just want some light-hearted romantic escape. My biggest complaint is that one of the best scenes from the original television airing is not included on this dvd.  After dinner with Darcy, Bingley and Miss Bingley, Amanda is asked to entertain them by singing a song.  She sings \\"Downtown\\" and it is so hilarious.  I was really disappointed that it was taken out.  You can catch the deleted scene on YouTube.  But if you don't mind great liberties taken with the original P&P you will enjoy this.  Go into it knowing it's just for fun.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Most people have said what to be said in the reviews.  Excellent lyrics & beautiful voice!
B000FS9FCG|1.0|Generally we don't question the abilities of superheroes. We could ask how it is that Superman can fly, but why spoil the fun? This film, however, preaches the merits of healthy skepticism; and we can be excused if we apply the lesson. In this spirit, then, we face the fact that in an Orwellian state of crushing powers a subversive, V, apparently working  alone, accomplishes remarkable things and has enough spare time not only to maintain his considerable martial arts skills but also to dress up his successes with fireworks displays.  How is this possible?  We're given no clue.  V FOR VENDETTA presents itself as a film of ideas and then asks us not to think.
031606792X|1.0|I've read the past three leading up to this one, I really wasn't wanting to read the first one and then like everyone else I was hooked.  All of them leading up to this one were pretty good so I don't know what happened with Breaking Dawn.      It was boring and terribly written. I had once read where Stephen King said Meyer couldn't write worth a damn.  I totally agree with him on this one.      I won't go into a dissertation of the book but it was not at all up to the standards of the past three.  (She's no JK Rowling.)  By the end of the book everyone is either mumurring or hissing - really.  I got so tired of the whole thing.  The best part about the book was Jacob's part.      Oh and Good Luck in getting through the first part of the book without puking! Good God the first part is terrible!
1603580557|5.0|This little book zeros in on Systems Thinking and provides the reader with all the information they need to get started down the road of commonsense.<br /><br />It covers stock and flow diagrams in detail. The author's style of teaching and writing make the reading very easy. She uses examples that are really easy to relate to.<br /><br />This book will make you start looking at everything as a stock, flow, or feedback loop.<br /><br />The samples are intended to be built in Stella/iThink and there is an appendix that has all the formulas in it. The thinking in systems web site says they are developing the models for download. In the meantime, you can build them all pretty quickly using the formulas provided.<br /><br />If you have no Systems Thinking experience, this book is a perfect introduction that should be read before reading a book like Software Process Dynamics.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone that wants a little more logic in their thought life. I really does put a new perspective on things.

1400082773|5.0|A beautiful, touching book. It should be an example for us all... This is a President, the way many should have been,i.e. JFK.  I loved the book.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|great movie, with a good lesson to be learned about lying and what can happen.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|Hey if you love comedy (not slapstick comedy) this movie is for you. Some of Bill Murry's finest work. The main character gets trapped living the same day over and over and goes through many phases. A classic.
B001PPF11W|5.0|Even though it is annoying how the record companies keep making us re-buy stuff we already have, the bonus material on all 3 of the new Radiohead reissues makes it well worth the purchase.
B001KMB6X2|4.0|The film, as others have stated already, is better than its average rating would make you think. It is atmospheric, presents good sets and actors and creates a dark futuristic environment which is credible. Surely the film stays behind its potential, but it still is a unique piece of art. This concerns the uncut version. I have not seen the theatrical version.

B000IJ79UW|5.0|This comic book movie is great. It brings a good start on the Superman series. It shows the origins of Superman. The planet Krypton was destroyed by a supernova. Before the planet's destruction, Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sends his infant son Kal-El to Earth to ensure the survival of the Kryptopian race. The asteroid with him in it landed on Earth three years later, on the farm town Smallville, where he was found by George and Martha Kent, who raised his as Clark Kent. When he turned 18, he discovers his powers, George dies of a heart attack and Clark left Smallville for Metropolis. On the way, he threw a Kryptopian Crystal into the water of the arctic and formed the Fortress of Solitude, where he discovers his true idenity. He trained and developed his powers for eight years and donned the mantle of Superman (Christopher Reeve). He arrived at Metropolis and got a job at the Daily Planet newspaper business, where he met Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Unknown to them, a criminal mastermind Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) begins a sinister plot as we speak.         This was a neat flick to check out. Christopher Reeve fitted the part really well. The visual effects were stunning. The action was neat, as well. This was the best of the original anthology. The second film's theatrical version was also pretty good, but campier than this one. I heard the third and fourth ones suck eggs. It would be 2006 when the second film's Richard Donner Cut and Superman Returns would be a great comeback in the series with Returns being the best in the franchise. They were also dedicated in memory of Reeve as well. The first is still a classic worth seeing.

B001ED7C58|5.0|If you liked all the songs in the movie, you'll of course like this CD.  I was a little surprised the other song Rob Patterson sang toward the end of the movie wasn't on there, but otherwise it's great.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|The quality of the product was good. I'm a huge fan of the James Bond movies. However, I was a bit disappointed with this one. It was just so very average.
B000000OTY|5.0|A great version of Peter Gabriel's concerts. The DVD is even better, adding a visual treat to some great and insightful music. Be sure to catch this version of \\"Shaking the Tree\\".
B000002UAO|5.0|Not one dull track on this whole album.  George Harrison shines with \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and \\"Think for Yourself\\", which has a great fuzz bass line.  Every song is a classic
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Still relevant and still masters of analog synthesis, Depeche Mode once again puts paid to the detractors who, with shovels in full swing, are only too eager to effect the premature burial of one of the most influential acts of modern music history.    While not at their best lyrically, the collage of synthesizers paint, at once, both a surreal and sublime musical soundscape.     With a nod to the past and an eye on the present, the boys from Basildon once again offer up something interesting and unique, despite a fanbase that has probably reached its zenith. Keeping everyone entertained is an achievement in itself and i think they do a masterful job here.     Tracks such as \\"Peace\\", \\"Wrong\\", \\"Fragile Tension\\" and  \\"Jezebel\\" are as good as any they've produced over the years. At times, both Gore and Gahan's vocals harken back to a time when Depeche Mode was the best kept secret in the business. In those moments, one finds the essence of the original allure of a band that has evolved and aged gracefully. As such, the more things change, the more they stay the same.    It is rare that one finds a band that captures all the important moments of one's life like mileposts on the road to elsewhere. Depeche Mode has always enthralled and delighted my senses with the atmosphere of sound they create.     And having said that, i find myself currently unable to put the disc away as it's just so darn delicious to chew on.     It has always been that sound, more than any contrived lyrics, that has captured my imagination and kept me in anticipation of future releases. Once again they've given me a little piece of themselves and considering the lateness of the hour i'm always appreciative.     As closing time approaches, it's hard to fathom that soon the boys will stow the electronics for good and reflect on a career as complex as any arrangement they've ever conceived.  It will be a sad day indeed, for we will surely be forced, in mourning, to \\"enjoy the silence\\".
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Beyond a doubt, this is the BEST Bond film ever. Yes, there are a few little quirky moments that I think the editor might have missed, but other than that it flows very nicely from beginning to end with very little opportunity to catch your breath. I was especially hesitant about this film due to Olga's role. After seeing her in Hitman I wasn't that interested in seeing her in this film, however, I think she did a great job and may have left an open door for a role in another Bond film in the future. The action scenes are amazing, the vulgar language and sex were almost non-existent, which is unusual for a Bond film, but didn't hurt this film at all. I like Bond's character development in this film, as well as the larger role M played, and the bigger parts a lot of the supporting players had, even Mr. White had a decent role...and managed to get away too, maybe he'll be back later as well. Could he be the early predecessor of Blofeld? Time will tell. Maybe the hardest part to watch was when they beat the pulp out of that beautiful Aston-Martin..again. My son and I had an ongoing debate on how many shots Bond actually fired at the Alfa Romeo from his DBS V12 in the prologue since the scene was really a fabulous bit of performance driving. Must have watched that scene a hundred times to count the shots.
1594481717|5.0|This is a very good book that offers fun and practical ways to get both halves of your brain working together.  As examples, I have been sketching (symphony) and eavesdropping (empathy), based on what I learned from this book.  I will be keeping my copy of the book with me for the foreseeable future - like a workbook and reference.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|I can only concur with the other 22 reviewers who have written about this set before me.<br /><br />22 discs, conducted by The Master himself (with one exception, and exceptional, disc conducted by friend and protege Robert Craft. It's 99.9% of the Stravinsky, including the lesser known - but equally fascinating - sacred works, chamber works, and orchestral works. Great stuff.<br /><br />I purchased that 22 disc set for about $30 (that's not a typo) from a UK seller listed on amazon/us and received it in less than a week - many US sellers take longer to ship their product!<br /><br />In fact, I'm listening to Stravinsky's Ragtime for 11 instruments as I write this - guaranteed to put a smile on your face!<br /><br />Of course for this price, you lose a great deal of annotation. But really - 22 discs for $30?!? The sound quality is very good to excellent with the exception of the one historic disc. And the transparancy and clarity of Stravinsky's baton work is astonishing! You may still choose to supplement some of these performances with others - particularly true for the three major ballets - but really, one could live with these performances for the rest of one's life and be satisfied.<br /><br />I know I will. Grab this set before the re-seller price jumps up.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|There's a lotta energy in this music...Day of the Eagle, the title track and Too Rolling Stoned are simply blazing guitar sounds. Robin Trower and the boys caught the magic in the bottle and parlayed it to a timeless recording. Dig it brothers and sisters!
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|I must admit that I stayed away from this set for many years. With sets by Goode, Gilels, Fischer, Schnabel's Pearl recordings and one Paul Lewis volume, I didn't need yet another set by a pianist disparaged ever since my long-gone college days. (Rubinstein, when asked about Kempff, dismissively replied \\"Kempff!\\", with a look a bemused contempt on his face\\")<br /><br />Apologies to Rubinstein - who if we are to be honest was never too successful in his attempts at Beethoven - but Wilhem Kempff's recordings of the sonatas are astounding. Never too fast, never too slow, no eccentricities, and an air of improvisation (which, I imagine to be true of Beethoven himself wen he composed these sonatas). The sonatas sound joyful and profound.<br /><br />There is a reason why SIbelius, upon hearing Kempff play the Hammerklavier said \\"You played not like a pianist, but like a human being\\". In humanizing these works - compositions better than they can ever be played - Kempff allows the listener to probe deeply, and once again discover unknown facets and relationships to emerge. The music flows from him naturally. These are not mannered performances (something that plagues Paul Lewis in his recent - though at times mesmerizing - cycle).<br /><br />I really cannot add much to the other reviews posted for the earlier versions of this set, lest I become unnecessarily verbose and pedantic.  I suggest you read those. Let me just say that at the current pricing of the re-released set you simply cannot afford NOT to own this cycle. It seems to be listed at less than $30, or even $20 from some third party sellers. True, for this price you sacrifice a detailed book of discussion in English/French/German and the discs themselves come in cardboard sleeves rather than multi-disc jewel boxes, but in all honesty, at this point in my life, I don't need all that that.  What I need is more shelf space!<br /><br />The sound of the recordings is first-rate. No compromises there.<br /><br />If you are sitting on the fence about yet another sonata set, - don't hesitate. This is beautiful piano playing, bar none. If I betray my own naivite by acknowledging my own unfamiliarity with - and aversion to - this set for decades so be it. I was foolish, and wrong.<br /><br />Listen to Kempff and re-discover the joy within this \\"new testament\\" of the piano bible. You will not be disappointed.re sitting on the fence about yet another sonata set, - don't hesitate. This is beautiful piano playing, bar none.

B001ECQ6E2|5.0|Loved it! It's been my favorite movie for years although alot of people still haven't even heard of it. I just had a movie party featuring this movie and the \\"audience\\" loved it too!
0312427999|5.0|I really hated Naomi Klein's first bestseller No Logo. I was annoyed by the author's limitless condescension towards poor inhabitants of third-world countries who are such pathetic little victims of horrible and mean Americans. I was equally bothered by her prelapsarian view of the America of the fifties where everything was oh-so-perfect. This \\"everything used to be good and now everything is so bad\\" rhetoric is just too annoying. Both the argument and the solutions she proposed seemed very simplistic.<br /><br />As a result of this painful experience, I had no intention of buying Klein's Shock Doctrine. When I decided to look at the first few pages that Amazon sends out as a free sample to prospective readers, I was stunned to discover that I really loved what I was reading. I stayed up the whole night devouring the entire 700-page book in one gulp. To my surprise, Shock Doctrine turned out to be really really good. It is a book on global economy and normally I find it incredibly hard and boring to follow through any argument that has to do with economics. Klein, however, manages to make the subject truly fascinating. The book is coherent, well-written, and very convincing. The research behind it is truly impressive. There is no trace here of the simplistic worldview that, in my opinion, informs every page of No Logo. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to understand the workings of the global economy.<br /><br />clarissasbox.blogspot.com/
B001O2ZW1A|1.0|This is not music.  How anyone could enjoy this is beyond me.  What hype! If you buy this and make the same mistake I did after reading this review you're stupid.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Bought it after reading Amazon reviews. Agree with all the 5 star reviews. A great epic, funny, entertaining, wonderful all around. All the girls at work loved it too!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|It is a touching story. Amazing cinematography.  I did not allow my thirteen year old daughter to watch it a couple weeks ago because it is rated R but I wish I would have.  This movie really depicts the struggles of poverty, prostitution, gangs, religious separation and it shows that there is hope even in hopeless times.  I enjoyed the movie.  It seemed a little long, but I don't think there is any part that could have been cut.  I also don't think this movie is not deserving of its \\"R\\" rating, no nudity, very little vulgar language and mild violence.  It is not a movie for younger kids but for those under 17, it can be used as a great medium for discussing childhood struggles in other nations.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|A classic romantic comedy British style. Rene Zellweger does the English accent well. For all romance fans.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|Attention listeners: This album is a major departure from Chris Cornell's previous albums or anything he's done with Soundgarden or Audioslave. So if you're expecting something fairly similar to that then I don't recommend it. However, if you're in the mood for something different and adventurous and hey, I'll just say it -- AMAZING, then you must pick this up!<br /><br />Wow, where do I start? Well first off, THANK YOU Chris Cornell! Don't listen to the naysayers. This album is brilliant! I'm so glad that Chris decided to try something different rather than put out the same type of stuff. His voice has never sounded better and the production by Timbaland is top notch. Interestingly, each song flows into the next without a break, which makes for a really unique listening experience. However, I am a little surprised at the track order. Maybe the order was chosen based on the outros but I feel that the latter part of the album is a lot stronger than the first half. Tracks 5-6 and 8-13 are just awesome. Tracks 1-4 and 7 are the weakest in my opinion. Usually, listeners check out the first couple tracks to see if they like an album. If someone just heard tracks 1-4, he or she may not be very impressed. However, if you want to sample it, I'd listen to tracks 10-12. My favorite tracks in order are:<br /><br />Long Gone<br />Climbing Up The Walls<br />Enemy<br />Other Side of Town<br />Never Far Away<br />Ground Zero<br />Scream<br />Watch Out<br />Sweet Revenge<br />Time<br />Part Of Me<br />Get Up<br />Take Me Alive<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful.

B001TOD9VI|4.0|THE WRESTLER<br /><br />**** Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- Decemeber 17th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 111-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- Robert Siegel<br /><br />Director- Darren Aronofsky<br /><br />Starring- Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei and Even Rachel Wood<br /><br />Even though this movie is about a wrestler I don't think you really need to be a fan of it. As a child I was a big wrestling fan and as popular as it was back then with sold out arenas it wasn't really cool to admit it. I lost interest for a long time before getting into it again as a teen and by this time nobody was ashamed to admit they liked it, but the time I reached my mid 20s I lost interest again, while being a fan of wrestling might help you enjoy this more even if you don't like it I don't think it will matter much at the movies core it's a lot deeper than just being about a wrestler.<br /><br />The Wrestler marked the big return for Mickey Rourke who once had a nice career going, but as time went on Rourke's career stalled and he was gone for a long time, but in recent years was making a slight come back with Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Sin City both by Robert Rodriguez, but The Wrestler took him from an actor making a slight come back to the success story of 2008. Rourke may have been popular in the past, but this movie is the role he will always be remembered for and for very good reason.<br /><br />To be honest I found The Wrestler to be a slight letdown, but don't take that wrong this was still an excellent movie and highly worthy of the praise it has received. I think for me the biggest problem is we've sort of seen this kinda flick done so many times it's a bit hard to put your own original take on it. But even with that The Wrestler is one of the best flicks of 2008 and Rourke's performance is no doubt one of the very best of the year and I'd go as far as to say one of the best of the decade.<br /><br />The screenplay by Robert Siegel was excellent and very well written, but I do have some slight problems with it. The main characters are very solid and interesting, but I personally felt a little more could have been done with both. Rourke's character Randy `The Ram' Robinson was once a big time wrestling superstar who performed in front of thousands and now he's pretty much broke wrestling in front of 50 people if lucky a fate that has happened to many wrestlers. But I would have liked for the writer to get into more detail on how The Ram went from the top of the wrestling world to the bottom.<br /><br />Anyone who follows wrestling at all know the reasons stuff like this happens and that's fine, but this is a movie and you can't rely on what happens to real life wrestlers. All of this wouldn't take a big long explanation and could have been summed up in a couple of minutes. The strongest sections of the screenplay are the scenes with Randy and his daughter Stephanie played by Evan Rachel Wood. These scenes are excellent and hard hitting; it's quite obvious why there is a lack of relationship, but I also would have liked to have seen more backstory. I liked Marisa Tomei's character, but I also felt there was a lot more to explore with her character as well.<br /><br />The script by Robert Siegel is very well written and the characters are great, but these complaints I have for me keep this from being a truly great movie. I do think The Wrestler is a great flick, but just those small complaints slightly hold it back for me. What I loved about the script is Randy is a man who has made a lot of mistakes in his life and is trying to make things right, but he's human and he still messes up despite trying. This isn't your typical Hollywood flick where somebody made mistakes and reached rock bottom and makes everything right.<br /><br />Director Darren Aronofsky does an excellent job and what might be slightly lacking with the screenplay Darren Aronofsky more than makes up for with a great tale of a fallen star. Aronofskycreates a gritty look that makes The Wrestler seem almost like a documentary rather than a movie and the brilliant performances make this for much more real. The pacing is solid and Aronofsky brings to life some excellent characters.<br /><br />The acting as I stated is simply amazing; this was the big comeback film for Mickey Rourke and he isn't an actor playing a part he is the character. Even with past success that Rourke has had The Wrestler is without a doubt the role he will always be remembered for. Rourke delivers one of the all time great performances and gives a truly touching performance. I never doubted Rourke's skills as an actor, but this performance just blew me away and I think he really should have taken home the best actor Oscar. Marisa Tomei also delivers a rock solid performance that was very worthy of her Oscar nomination and Marisa is still amazingly beautiful. Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's daughter Stephanie nearly steals the show. Like I stated about my complaints with the script the actors were so amazing they bring a lot more depth than maybe the screenplay gave them.<br /><br />As excellent as Rourke and Tomei were together, Rourke and Evan Rachel Wood just might be better. Wood is a talented young actress and with The Wrestler hopefully more people take notice. My only complaint is she isn't in enough scenes. I think had her role been larger she could have received an Oscar nomination as well.<br /><br />Overall The Wrestler was one of the best films of 2008, but the complaints I had for me keeps this movie from reaching brilliant status, but with that said I still found this to be a great movie and the acting was amazing and Mickey Rourke delivers the performance of a lifetime. As good as The Wrestler was Mickey Rourke is what elevates the movie. The Wrestler comes highly recommended. It's a tragic story and even as flawed as Randy is and as deserving of his fate at times, Rourke brings so much emotion you'll be rooting for the character to get his life together.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is alright; the picture quality is excellent, but still maintains the gritty look Darren Aronofsky was going for and the sound quality is also excellent. The features slightly lack however. There's a 42-min behind the scenes and a 20-min discussion with a few pro wrestlers and finally a music video by Bruce Springsteen. The release was alright not the worst, but not the best, but the picture and sound are solid.iant performances make this for much more real. The pacing is solid and Aronofsky brings to life some excellent characters.

0123694965|5.0|Like Schell, I teach in a university game development program. But unlike him, I do not have personal experience in the commercial game industry, so I am always on the lookout for ways to vicariously expand my knowledge.  This book is the best I have seen on the topic of game design (and there are a _lot_ of them these days :-).  The central metaphor of game design not being a linear procedure, but rather a confluence of perspectives, rings true and works well as an expository technique.  I plan to use it with my students.  Thanks, Jesse.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|T2 is an awesome movie,but it seems like it's re-released every other year or so! I mean DVD had 3 different editions(the barebones from 1998,the Ultimate Edition from 2000,and the Extreme from 2003. This will be the 2nd time around on Blu Ray,I'll just be keeping my Blu Ray release from 2006,since the theatrical version is my prefered favorite anyway!I kept my Ultimate and Extreme DVD's for the extras!!! This IS a good release because it does have multiple cuts of the movie though,and I might buy when the prices lowers. This is how the original Blu Ray should have been released,but ya can't change the past!!!

1441498141|5.0|What is amazing is that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin when he wrote this book - yet he could have been written it last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection.  When Darwin wrote it would be near impossible to prove what he states, yet he predicted what is now possible to prove today.  This book is not historical, its alive and well, and needs to be read!
B0012GMW0C|5.0|When you hear the name \\"Journey\\", what do you think of? \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" comes to mind so does \\"Any Way You Want It\\" and other personal favorites comes to mind too. But what about songs like \\"Mystery Mountain\\" or \\"To Play Some Music\\" or the fact that keyboardist Gregg Rollie was the lead vocals? Yes this is their first album entitled \\"Journey\\". Being aware of only the 78-08 Journey, I was a little bit skeptic when I found out about the first three Journey albums, but they're a unique trio of albums and they show the roots of the band. The vocal tracks remind of some of my other favorite bands like the Beatles, The Doors, and The Eagles, especially such songs like \\"Of A Lifetime\\" and \\"To Play Some Music\\". The instrumental tracks were a standard in the 70s Journey repertoire and personally, I like them. They're have more like a jazzy rock feel to them and they sound very similar to the 70s fusion quintet, Weather Report. Overall, I recommend it to anyone who is interested into hearing Journey's roots. It's very interesting to see this band evolve into the band they are today.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|It arrived in perfect condition and have not had any issues with the disk. Exactly what I would expect.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|I've listened to Crack the Skye three times, but still cannot finds words that sufficiently capture and rate this album. Bust out your headphones and sit down for an hour, because Mastodon demands your complete attention. Remission, Leviathan, and Blood Mountain are all unique, astounding albums, but exist as wholly autonomous achievements and don't serve to preview the mind-blowing musical explosion of Crack the Skye.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this album now. If you downloaded it, buy a copy. Mastodon has surpassed any expectations that could've been set for their latest creation.   This album earns an easy five stars; this will definitely end up on my Top Ten list of 2009.
B00081MUY0|5.0|Sunshine Superman by Donovan has a lot of his great music and many say that this was perhaps his greatest album ever. They just may be right! Donovan's exceptional talent comes through quite clearly on this CD; and the bonus tracks make it very valuable for any Donovan fan. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork incorporates the artwork from the original release of this on vinyl back in the day.<br /><br />The CD starts with the title track which was also one of Donovan's biggest hits ever, \\"Sunshine Superman.\\" Simply put, \\"Sunshine Superman\\" is a masterpiece; it has that great folk rock flavor with just a touch of flower power as a side dish! Donovan never skips a beat; his excellent diction enhances his performance and the stunning musical arrangement fits in perfectly with Donovan's vocals. The music makes good use of the guitars, too. \\"Legend Of A Girl Child Linda\\" gets a most sensitive treatment from Donovan; he does this one up right! The arrangement makes good use of the percussion and the woodwind instruments; and the strings are heavenly! This is great music.<br /><br />\\"Three Kingfishers\\" has a psychedelic flavor to it that works wonders for this ballad; and listen for \\"Ferris Wheel.\\" \\"Ferris Wheel\\" has folk and psychedelic elements to the arrangement and Donovan never skips a beat--awesome! \\"Ferris Wheel\\" lacks nothing--it's all THAT good. How's about those drums, too? \\"Bert's Blues\\" has a great sound to it and Donovan delivers this very well. Donovan handles complex tempo and key changes on \\"Bert's Blues\\" just like the champ he was and still remains!<br /><br />\\"Season Of The Witch\\" is another highlight of this album; I really like \\"Season Of The Witch;\\" and if you enjoy this genre of music you're bound to like this song. \\"Trip\\" has a terrific beat--if you won't find yourself energized by \\"Trip\\" you had better check your pulse! The guitars and percussion work well as Donovan sings \\"Trip\\" to perfection--and beyond! I love it. \\"Guinevere\\" is another ballad that gets a sensitive treatment; and \\"Fat Angel\\" uses the guitar to great advantage. I just plain love the sound of \\"Fat Angel\\" and Donovan makes this quite a strong tune.<br /><br />\\"Celeste\\" has a very pretty melody; and then we get seven bonus tracks! \\"Breezes of Patchulie\\" has a very lush musical arrangement that complements Donovan's singing faultlessly; and the flavor of the first version of \\"Museum\\" stuns me with its beauty. \\"Museum\\" is clearly a major highlight of this album; the guitars sound great and Donovan never sounded better. \\"Superlungs\\" has a psychedelic rock feel to it; and listen for Donovan to do justice to \\"Land of Doesn't Have To Be.\\"<br /><br />The stereo version of \\"Sunshine Superman\\" is another gem on this disc; and the demo version of \\"Good Trip\\" really shows Donovan working hard to create a fine tune. The CD ends very well with a demo version of \\"House of Jansch;\\" and this leaves me wanting more.<br /><br />Donovan was quite a flower power artist in the 1960s; and fortunately he still lives to give us even more wonderful music. I highly recommend this CD for any Donovan fan; the bonus tracks alone are worth more than the price of admission! This is also a great starter CD for people new to the artistry of Donovan.s a sensitive treatment; and \\"Fat Angel\\" uses the guitar to great advantage.

B001IBIQU6|3.0|Depeche Mode's newest record clearly aims towards what I would characterize as a very techy-ambient type sound: clipped synthesized drums that are purposefully in the background, moog bass lines and stylings, and lots of ambient synth noise.  It's a sound that's \\"in\\" right now, and I am not a huge fan of it.  However, Depeche Mode on \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" accomplishes getting the potential from this style to a point.  They manage to keep things nice and balanced, particularly with the slightly de-tuned guitars on many tracks, and they ocasionally inject a little attitude when needed.  Of course, it goes without saying that the production and the synth-work is beyond compare.    The album starts with a slow ambient simple vocal of \\"In Chains\\" leading into the hard stomp of \\"Hole to Feed\\".  The 2nd song sets the tone for the album in a good way.  The techy type elements are nicely balanced with some guitar and attitude, and the unique synth work keeps things interesting.  We then go into the mercifully short \\"Wrong\\" - just kind of headache inducing combination slow disco dissonance and a yelled vocal.    The best part of the record is in the middle.  We get a nice progression of energy slowly built between \\"Fragile Tension\\", \\"Little Soul\\", \\"In Sympathy\\", and \\"Peace\\" - probably the high point of the album for me because of it's balance of actually having a hook, nice synth-work on the verses, and an anthemic scale.    Then the band goes off into more experimental territory with some mixed results.  They start with the ambient-turned-up-to-11 \\"Come Back\\" followed by the slow instrumental \\"Spacewalker\\".  It's a good thing they put the instrumental where they did on the record, because clearly going right into \\"Perfect\\" would have clashed painfully with the aimless dark and confused energy of the former, for those of us who listened to the album in sequence before writing our review.    The last 4 tracks of the record are somewhat uneven.  We have another mid-paced respectable \\"Perfect, but then the monotonous  \\"Miles Away\\" kills the mood.  Ironically, \\"Miles Away\\" probably has the best radio chance of anything on the record.  It has a mid-paced 4/4 beat and is utterly predictable and boring.  We have the nice ambient ballad \\"Jezebel\\" following that - on which the band employs a guest vocalist (* note - For those who actually care.... I have been corrected on this by a Depeche Mode fan that it was actually Martin L. Gore singing on this track), then another unremarkable meandering 3/4 strut that ends the record.    In summary, I'm neither surprised or disappointed with this offering.  It's basically what the band has been doing since \\"Exciter\\", but with a stagnant quality.  It's time to change things up a bit for the next release.  Still, there is solid song-writing throughout (save for \\"Miles Away\\") and there are enough organic elements to keep things interesting with nice guitar and synth work throughout.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Wow. This video is intense! I'm very overweight and out of shape, so start my workout schedule with this video. I can definitely see and feel a difference just after a week with this video. My biggest problem is Jillian. I know she's \\"tv's toughest trainer\\" but she just gets so annoying. I can't stand listening to her, she's just not encouraging at all. I'm not asking for babying, but a little encouragement instead of belittling would be nice. But at the same token, she gets the job done! It's a great video, a great workout and she knows what she's doing. Now if she'd just stop talking. :) But I definitely recommend it if you're serious about losing weight and getting into shape!
B001UE276A|5.0|The new album by Depeche Mode, Sounds of the Universe, is truly a masterpiece. I highly recommend the box set. It is worth every penny.
B001TH16DS|5.0|After reading the reviews here about this movie, I simply have to comment about the apparent cost of this set of disks. This release is not merely a transfer to Blu-Ray, which is, in and of itself, an expensive technology, nor a mere digital remastering of the original masters. This release incorporates total digital re-engineering of the soundtrack   AND a totally alternate version on the same disk in which the special effects were redone with todays CGI capabilties. I watched a video with a side-by-side comparison of the old effects and the new CGI. It was very impressive and should be considered a new authoring of the original series. For those purists who say this is a bastardization of the original series, I would have to agree  save the fact that this rendition with the new CGI can be ignored if one  wishes. Both versions are immediately available to switch back and forth, thereby rendering that argument without merit. This represents a new enhancement technique which adds entertainment value to the original series, and at no small expense. Probably the ultimate outcome of such change will be the creation a new \\"Generation\\" of fans who watch the enhanced version while many of the parents will remain loyal to the original cheezy matte-photography effects incorporated in the original.  After all, production-values of a particular era are part of   the fun of watching classic movies and television, are they not?  So, as they used to say, \\"You pays your money and you takes your choice\\". This is an interesting concept which will more than likely be reproduced in other remasterings of original productions.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|This film marks the second time novelist James Lee Burke's Cajun detective Dave Robicheaux has been brought to film, the first being Alec Baldwin's remarkably un-Cajun version in \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\" back in 1996.  The first film was solid, but it wasn't quite the magic a series needs to launch, nor did it capture critics or audience.  This film doesn't fare much better, but not for the same reasons.<br /><br />James Lee Burke's gift as a writer isn't complex mysteries, but complex characters and a poetic way of describing Louisiana country.  Only one of these gifts (cinematography) tends to resonate well in a film of what we've come to consider \\"average\\" length.  So things that propel his novels, like Dave's inner monologues, are mostly cast aside and when they do appear they come off as expositional and flat.<br /><br />Another thing that works against these adaptations is their endings, which is not their fault.  Burke's villains are clear, not very mysterious, and the endings are fairly stock.  They work in the book because the book is mostly a character study of its protagonist.  When applied to these films, however, this tact feels anti-climactic.<br /><br />It also bears pointing out that neither of these films features a key fun element: Dave's right-hand man Clet Purcell (a role many Burke fans thought Goodman would be perfect for), which is in keeping with their respective titles, but does lose some of the magic of better books in the series.  Neither of these books reflects the highest moments of the series overall, so they're hard-pressed to launch the films they become into the stratosphere (and in the case of In the Electric Mist, even into US. theaters).  This adapatation is also hurt by a very unlikely source: the Will Patton-read audiobooks.  Patton does such a phenomenal job capturing the tone and characterizations of Burke's world that it's hard not to see Robicheaux as Patton (who I was bucking for Hollywood to hire, but knew it was unlikely).  I kept peeking around the corners, waiting for that perfect gravely voice to lay it all out for me, but it never came.<br /><br />Electric Mist has plain direction and largely feels like an homage and not an interpretation.  The director's (Bertrand Tavernier doing his first U.S. made film) love of American crime novels is no secret, but parts of this film come off as mild fan fiction:  I love me some Buddy guy, but he can't act.  Levon Helm has some pedigree, but never made his bread and butter off of acting either, and in such an understated role here, it shows.  These are vanity choices by a director enamored of American icons, not American acting.  The people in this film that can act are largely being restrained in the name of understated performances.  Even the big bad guy loses a key scene in the book where he takes a shot at Dave (batter up!) and with little else to hang his menace on, John Goodman just comes off like a storm cloud with no rain in it.  I credit the crew with largely sticking to the book and avoiding knee-jerk Hollywood-isms, like trying to explain the ethnicity of Dave's child or back track through half a dozen books for back story.<br /><br />For all intents and purposes you could watch these films back-to-back and get a nice snapshot of Burke's world, even if the characterizations of the lead are vastly different.  It's interesting to see how different the acting is in roles that cross both films. Some of it is better in the first film (Badja Jola as Batist is way more engaging than Walter Breaux, and Hawthorne James is more menacing than any of the villains in Electric Mist).  Jones is a better Dave.  Mix it up and you'd have had a better film all around.<br /><br />There are great movies that could be made of Burke's books.  Putting more surgical directors on the job would be a good place to start; picking the right book is a close second.  Somewhere between the moodiness of the first film and the clean lines of the second is a great adaptation worthy of launching a series.  And at this point, I'm down with Tommy Lee Jones doing it across the board.  He's got the grit and the soul, even if he does slip into typical Tommy Lee Jones stoicism a lot more than Robicheaux might warrant.  Fans of the books should check it out anyway.this point, I'm down with Tommy Lee Jones doing it across the board.

0545128285|4.0|I'm not too huge a fan of the Harry Potter books. They were alright, and I never saw what the huge deal was.    I honestly enjoyed this little mini-book of fairy tales though. I think that perhaps a lot of the more disappointed reviews didn't anticipate what this was, so I'll tell you. It's four short stories (one of which was already available in the seventh book) in one little volume of less than 100 pages. That said, I thought these stories were cute and fun; you just have to look at them as though they're for children, as that seems to be the case.    If you like cute kid's stuff, or you have a kid who likes to read, then I say go ahead and buy it.
031606792X|2.0|I fell in love with the first 3 books in this series.  I read them in less than 2 weeks and put off practically everything else in life to read on.      To say that this book has been a disappointment is an understatement.  Stop reading after the first part of the honeymoon or it may ruin the story and characters forever.      The story and characters take a sick and bizarre twist, almost like it couldn't be the same writer or characters at all.  I went from loving Edward and Bella to being disgusted by the whole plot.  They should not have ended this way and I wish I never would have read it.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|this movie is a riot. I am not a war buff or enthusiast but I have seen Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line (best war movie ever), and Platoon. This movie takes what the first Scary Movie did well, but doesn't punch you in the face with the references (all the time).<br /><br />Despite not liking Stiller's usual B comedies or Jack Black's zany acting, the reason I decided to give this movie a watch was I visited Kauai when they were filming it there and figured gotta watch it for that reason alone.<br /><br />Story: Lot of good jokes, both written and visual. Camera work looks as if they're trying too hard for that gritty war film style, probably the point, since it comes off as melodramatic and goofy. A lot of good observational jokes on the stereotypes found in a lot of Hollywood action/war films.<br /><br />Video: This blu-ray looks good. Vibrant colors, sharp lines, and despite all the outside shooting, the picture does not suffer from grain, take this w/ a grain of salt since my tv is a 32\\".<br /><br />Audio: Very clear audio track, dialogue very clear, music and sound efx sound great.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want a movie that can provide a ton of laughs and never takes itself too seriously, I'd suggest giving it a watch, and all the more reason if you like any of the main leads (or wanna see Tom Cruise as a psycho extra from Entourage).
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I read the reviews prior to buying just out of curiosity (I was going to buy regardless). So I bought the album and... loved it from first listen. For those that claim it's 'awful', I question their sanity. Look, everyone is entitled to an opinion but such a cynical review makes absolutely no sense... but then again this is the internet so such cynical views is a given regardless of how good or bad something is. I can understand someone saying they don't like this album but it's so far from awful it's ridiculous.     I haven't liked a DM album in its entirety in a long time (fan since the mid-80s). This album is so pleasing to the ear it's unbelievable.    Look, if you're on the fence with this one, you can spare 9.99 and buy the album. At the worst you won't like it. So go ahead, be adventurous and buy this album! C'mon, I mean it. Don't read another review and go buy it!

B001DJ7PR8|1.0|I am glad that I saw this movie on a plane and didn't spend good money to see this turkey.  I think that what Woodie Allen had to say he said years ago and should be banned from ever making another film.  I am a fan of all the actors and they did well with the stupid script the had to work with, but none of the roles were even worth a nomination.

B000C3H4L8|5.0|Hard to believe that 32 years ago Tina,David and the gang dropped this debut album that is still challanging musicians in the art pop field today. So....this being my first time really hearing it in it's whole how do I feel having been a long time fan of the Heads classic music to come? Well for something so influential on the \\"art pop\\" field...that's just the whole thing with this album. It may have come out of the world of CBGB's punk but by NO MEANS is this a \\"punk record\\". It's not exactly simple,it's not exactly loud and rocking out but it's got something huge going for it. Even at this early point,using the basic band the main focus of Talking Heads musically was the rhythm;everything from the great \\"island groove\\" of \\"Uh Oh,Love Comes To Town\\" through tunes like \\"Happy Day\\" and \\"The Book I Read\\" are just filled with lots of funk. And one thing David Byrne always understood about making a great funk tune that wasn't fake sounding was to keep the rhythms tight and simple. Interestingly enough Jerry Harrison's new-wavish keyboards (heard of course most famously on \\"Psycho Killer\\") gives this music a sound I'll call \\"funk-wave\\";no need to guess what that stands for lol. Add to that David Byrnes already awkward,detached and nervously delivered lyrics and BOOM you have a band with a totally unique sound. Tina's basslines on songs like \\"No Compassion\\" and \\"First Weel/Last Week..Carefree\\"..well pretty much everything here even bring to mind,yes a light disco flavor.But if you know that genre's influence on new-wave/punk no panicking for the discophobes please;this isn't exactly [[ASIN:B000P6R6VK Saturday Night Fever]],unless of course it was being done outside our space time continuum that is. This album all came together over several years before it even came out and the result is a band whose concepts were as rooted in the New York avante garde culture in terms of feeling but also full of great pop melodies and funky grooves. So the group really says it all for someone like me whose into all that kind of stuff. The last tune \\"Pulled Up\\" is the most rocky thing here and...well it's really not straight new wave. Talking Heads were never about playing it straight;they were a total oxymoron-a commercial mainstream band with a totally uncommercial,hip attitude. As for the bonus tracks you get to hear some more likeminded tunes that seem to extend on David Burns lyrical obsession here with buildings (you can hear plenty of that on \\"Don't Worry About The Government\\" too) and you also get the original version of \\"Psycho Killer\\".Now the story goes that the albums producer Lance Quinn originally did the song with creepy cellos and horns in the backround;was this his idea of a rock n roll Peter & The Wolf or something?Who knows,who cares but it's an interesting version-doesn't have the same impact as the one we all know and...okay maybe it's a little overdone but it sounds good. And about this sound,much has been made of the DualDisk format,a plus for me buying this but upsetting for many others. Since this was the first CD version of this I ever had (my first was a cassette) I love the format;it plays on all my CD players,all from different eras dating back to 1990 and rips on my laptop CD drive. Not only that but,on a set of older computer speakers in my BASEMENT this remastering is so terrific it literally sounds like the day it was made. You almost get the impression all the tracks were re-recordered on a new digital master rather then just remastered the sound is so alive and punchy-no issue with the loudness war here. So with no minuses there's a million pluses to enjoying this album and despite the warnings I recommend getting this version.The notes are better,you have bonus tracks and DVD footage and you also get the amazing sound even on the regular CD side!says it all for someone like me whose into all that kind of stuff.

So with no minuses there's a million pluses to enjoying this album and despite the warnings I recommend getting this version.The notes are better,you have bonus tracks and DVD footage and you also get the amazing sound even on the regular CD side!
B000NVADJY|5.0|My loving husband knows how much I'm afraid to have a terrible & traumatic death. After reading this book, loaned to him by his secretary, he gave it to me & said \\"I think this book will help you feel better\\". Perfect timing! My father recently became ill & passed away. I felt the angels & spirits all around during his last few days w/ us. Since then, we bought a book to keep. Wonderful & helpful reading material.

B001FBSMF8|5.0|As a die hard rock fan I was a bit put off by the heavy beat infused pop textures at first, but the more I listened to this disc, the deeper it sunk it's hooks into me.     As I always do when I travel, I try to take music along that will pass the boring hours on trains, planes and automobiles. I downloaded several new tracks to keep me occupied, but I found myself listening to this disc over and over and over.    The layers are rich, Chris puts the right amount of guitar exactly where it needs to be. As always his vocals are intriguing and the harmonies are spectacular.    Have an open mind and give this disc a few listens and I'm sure you will find yourself as hooked as I am.  This disc is in steady rotation on my iphone, I absolutely Love it!!!!!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I have watched this \\"mini-series\\" now 4 times since receiving the DVD from Amazon immediately after its release and each time the production gets better and more brilliant. Excepting the few tiresome references to today's world of PC the writing is brilliant and very Austen-esque in style and therefore very believable. The casting was great, Mr & Mrs Bennett, great and I would say, regarding the Bennett sisters, they are the best to date, e.g., Jane,  Lydia, Kitty and Mary and although \\"Lizzie\\" had a fairly small part she would have been a great Elizabeth in any of the past P&P productions. I would have to say that Mr. Collins' character was a bit over the top and his \\"habit\\" detracted from an excellent script. Wickham seemed to be much more spot on had a Lydia/Wickham relationship developed in this \\"what-if\\" production. Also, Lady KDB, Mr. Bingley, sister Caroline Bingley and Charlotte Lucas all very well cast.    Mr. Darcy might be construed by some who view this production as a bit too harsh, but his character seemed to be more \\"in character\\" for the \\"landed aristocracy\\" of the period of English history being depicted and true to the novel, softens as the romantic interest develops.    Amanda, simply a great casting choice and a brilliant and believable performance!! Hope to see Ms. Rooper again.    I will say that the premise of this mini-series could not have been pulled off in any less than the 3 hours the DVD runs. However, be forewarned that there is heavy, if not total use, of \\"hand-Held\\" cameras which produce an annoying and distracting bobbing and weaving effect of the filmed image. Also, a minimum 5.1 audio track would have been nice to have.    All in all this production is a very well executed and respectable \\"what if\\" adaptation of Jane Austen's most famous novel and well worth the price to add to anyone's Jane Austen video collection. I highly recommend this DVD.    Oh, I too am disappointed that the scene in which Amanda sings \\"Downtown\\" has been cut. That edit creates  a huge continuity issue due to the several references to Amanda's singing ability later in the movie. I can only believe that leaving the scene in the DVD would have served to renew interest in an old, somewhat forgotten song and consequently renewed sales. So, the deletion of the scene results in the score movie fans 0, music retailers 0, lawyers 0, a no win for all involved. Badly done, badly done!!

Although there are similarities, this is not those movies, and the plot unfolds in a totally different manner.  Neverthess, if you appreciate it for what it is, two hours of excellent escapism, you might discover that it's an enjoyable experience in it's own way.<br /><br />Sexy hot new temp Lisa (Ali Larter) gets it bad for happily married exec Derek.  Wife Sharon (Beyonce) goes on hyper alert. \\"Is she pretty?\\" she asks. \\"Pretty plain,\\" he says. Oh oh.<br /><br />As you probably can imagine the innocent relationship takes a turn, as Lisa pursues Derek.  There is nothing she won't do to get what she wants, and the situation spirals out of control in unexpected ways.  Will Derek give in to temptation or tell his wife what's going on?<br /><br />Obsessed delivers solid entertainment, and the fight scene between between Beyonce and Ali Larter is one of the best girl fights you'll see.  \\"You think you're crazy? You ain't seen crazy, [...]!\\"<br /><br />Beyonce acting in the Austin Powers movie was singer playing singer. Her acting seemed unnatural.  Her facial expressions vacant, her emotions not quite right. In an interview on Oprah she said she was taking acting lessons.

A convincing and confident performance.  She has become a dramatic actress.<br /><br />Although Beyonce is the star, Ali Larter,[[ASIN:0780631684 Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)]] and Heroes, is a dreamgirl, and it requires some suspension of disbelief to imagine anyone resisting her.  The three actors play excellently, although the camera favors Beyonce, it's not at the expense of the story, or the other two actors who perform brilliantly.

The disc winds up with \\"15 minute Flic School\\" , \\"Sin City: Live in Concert\\", \\"10 minute Cooking School\\", \\"The Long Take\\" and an \\"All Green Screen Version\\". The last featurette shows how the film looked when they were shooting on the set running at \\"800 times\\" the normal speed accompanied by Rodriguez's score.

B00007KQKM|4.0|This 1992 adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" is my favorite of the three adaptations I've watched [the other two being the 1981 version starring Sylvia Kristel in the lead, and the 2006 French version with Marina Hands].<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, the central character Lady Chatterley [played with consummate skill by Joely Richardson] is a sexually-frustrated wife to Lord Clifford Chatterley [James Wilby], a WW I paralyzed vet. Typical of upper class Brits and the landed gentry, Chatterley is concerned about providing an heir for his estate and suggests his wife takes a lover. Contrary to his expectations that Lady Chatterley will take up with a 'suitable' man, i.e. preferably titled, she goes for the well-built gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors [Sean Bean] and the pair begin a torrid affair that crosses the boundaries of class and all that is socially acceptable at the time.<br /><br />The chemistry between Richardson's Lady Chatterley and Bean's Mellors is the highlight of this movie. The pair truly sizzle on-screen, and though Lawrence's novel was not merely a bodice-ripping read, but a serious attempt at portraying social themes, such as class boundaries etc, the passion is central to the main character's development. This was credibly portrayed on-screen as viewers get to see the evolution of Lady Chatterley as her burgeoning sexuality transforms her on the outside as much as it does internally, both emotionally and physically.<br /><br />The sex scenes are graphic, but tastefully done. The cinematography is simply beautiful.As for the extras on the DVD, there is an interview with writer/director Ken Russell, a behind-the-scenes photo gallery, an author biography, and cast and crew filmographies. I'd rate this as my favorite screen adaptation of \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" and recommend it to those who are fans of British period dramas, Brit Lit adaptations, as well as fans of romance dramas.
B001VGFMBY|5.0|This guy is special.  The Honeybears are great too.  Can't wait for them to come up to Philadelphia.  Makes me wish I still lived down south.  In fact alot of music makes me feel that way, but its just a matter of time for Black Joe Lewis, his head is in the right place.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|When I first heard about this show I figured we were at the point where a few producers through a hundred different ideas into a hat, pull out five and then make a show about it.  On paper this just sounded like a bunch of lame elements thrown together, but I've been pleasantly surprised.  It manages to take all of those \\"lame\\" elements and intricately weave them all together in a somewhat (for TV) believable way.    If you're a fan of shows like Dexter, Weeds and Sopranos, this show is right up your alley.  It's detail-rich with great characters and interesting twists.  I'm glad they renewed it and I hope they get a few more seasons out of it.  With the way season 2 is shaping up, they're setting it up for quite a few more seasons.  Sweet!
0312853238|5.0|Orson Scott Card scored both of Science Fiction's major awards for this book and its immediate sequel, Speaker for the Dead, and he deserved it. This book is about some big Ideas - keep in mind that plot and characterization are secondary to that - or rather that they are done in order to fulfill the Ideas that he is trying to convey.    In the future, far enough away but also a little too close to us, Ender Wiggin is taken to a military school in the asteroid belt as a young child in order to be trained to be a military leader to fight back a race of aliens that have attacked Earth before and probably will again. But the leaders of this academy, of the world, have some specific specifications for the military commander they are trying to create and the ways they seek to attain this are not gentle on Ender's mind, body, or soul. What will Ender become as a result of this training?    If you get the paradox that this book presents, the irony should be physically painful. It searches deep into the collective soul of humanity and comes up with darkness but also with hope. And it hints at the question to be asked later in the series: Is humanity the race that no one can live with because of its hatred and violence?    Ender's Game has been marketed as a young adult book, but the issues this book deals with are complex and just as compelling for an adult as for a teen or preteen reader. If you have not read this book and ever thought you should give it a shot - do so, because you probably won't regret it.    Also: Free-fall fights in 3-D. Oh. My. God. If you can respect nothing else about Card, respect his ability to imagine fights in weightless conditions and imagine them well.
0061122416|3.0|I love this book because I used to wonder what would I be in the future. I never was sure about either being a musician or just play it safe and listen to my parents suggestion. I realized being a professional musician probably is impossible but I know which part of my strength can help making more good music because I listen to my heart, it sounds vague, but I did succeed and got this message of just being a norm in order for the talented people to shine on. At the same time, I am not giving up my music dream and I am going to open up my own label company to make music and better the world. The obstacles are not important at all because I believe fate will guide me to the right place as long as the courage of pursuing the dream is still there.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I have both versions of the box sets.

B001UV4XUG|5.0|The film's opening makes it clear: This is not a love story. It is a story about love. Told in a non chronological fashion, we see 500 days in the relationship of Tom (Joseph Gordon- Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel). For those who have seen 10 Things I Hate About You, this is an evolution of that story told in a more realistic fashion. While Joseph Gordon-Levitt pretty much plays the same character, he adds gravitas to the ups and downs of relationships which all men go through at some point. Zooey Deschanel brings her playful carefree attitude to Summer, which the movie itself is quick to point out has a very strong effect over men. While most people expect this to be a love story, it's not. It's a carefully crafted story about relationships and the highs and lows we all experience and how we focus on the highs more than the lows. The quirky humor and the wittiness brought out in the film covers the very introspective dissection of a relationship. While the ending is somewhat expected, it serves as the movies last laugh. A must see for romantics, indie film appreciators and mainstream audiences alike, this movie is the guide to growing up all boys need to become men. Especially, once they see the Plate scene. Check it out!

B001LV5OOY|4.0|White Lies' debut \\"To Lose My Life\\" echoes back Joy Division, The Cure, The Psychedelic Furs, and more recently The Killers and Interpol. This is a good thing, because we need more goth like Joy Division.<br /><br />\\"To Lose My Life\\" is solid from beginning to end with the best tracks up for modern rock radio being \\"Death\\", \\"To Lose My Life\\", \\"A Place To Hide\\", \\"Fifty On Our Foreheads\\" and \\"From The Stars\\". The album is definitely front loaded with the more compelling tracks on the first half of the album. However, all the songs fit together nicely, making the album easy to listen to from beginning to end.<br /><br />Certainly one of the best releases of 2009, and one of the best debuts of the year, I hope White Lies continue to expand and deliver for years to come.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|Interesting telling of a story about a child of poverty in India who beomes a millionaire and wins the love of his life to boot. Entertaining?

Just as \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" lost to \\"Crash\\", and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" lost to \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", somebody was smoking something when they voted on this one.

B0019IB0II|2.0|I haven't read the book, but did hear her talk on TED. I have studied mystical and religious experiences at the PhD level, including a good amount about its neurobiological correlates. There are critical problems with her thesis that aren't being recognized...     Mystical experience has been studied for some time. Is there any evidence that loss of left (as opposed to right) hemisphere function specifically causes mystical experience? No.      Furthermore, is there any evidence that experiencing stroke is correlated to mystical experience? No. This would be widely known if it were true. They've been trying to prove a connection with epilepsy and mystical experience for a long time, for example, although this isn't turning out well.    What really happened to this woman is that she went into what is known as a state of witnessing experience. This is a common mystical state, and can happen spontaneously to anyone, at any time, although  particularly to people in crisis. While she describes her stroke, she is also describing this state of awareness--she mixes and conflates the two.     What she then does is what many people do: She explains the experience in the terms she best understands, which in this case is neurobiology, and then force fits it. To do so, she comes up with a long ago discredited notion, that the right hemisphere is the key to a holistic life. This split brain idea went out of vogue a long time ago.    If you want more credible discussions of the neurobiological of spiritual experience and more sophisticated discussions of how it might be arrived at, I recommend the work of Andrew Newberg as well as Mario Beauregard.

B001PPF11W|5.0|I'm not about to give this reissue 1 star because the content just don't deserve it. It's a great album, sometimes showing a tougher and more human edge to Radiohead that I've always thought future albums lacked (despite they had way much more to offer).    The problem is that I'm buying this album once a year. Two years ago when I discovered it, last year in the box set, and now. While the first reissue added nothing, this one has lot of really good bonus material.  Nothing to complain about the packaging either, they done a good job.  It's just that I say like the man bleeding and diying tied to a chair pleeding Kanye West to \\"get\\" the gayfish joke in the South-Park episode.  Come on EMI, just \\"GET IT\\"!   We are no fish!    I've always like to have bonus material, it helps you understand the context of the album you listen to, but I come to a point when I HOPE  there won't be a super deluxe edition 3cd 2dvd with exclusive unreleased material any soon.
B001RTP3YQ|4.0|I have every album and CD Leonard Cohen has released. I have been in love with his music since I first heard his music in the late 1960s. Hearing him in concert has topped my list of things I really want to do before I die - AND on May 5 I will finally get to see him and hear him live in Chicago. Back in the days of albums I always purchased 2 albums and left one unopened so it wouldn't get scratched. Now that I've established that I think he is the world's best songwriter and singer, I have to say that this CD does not do for me what any of his other CD's have done. Of course I recommend buying it if you need to complete your Cohen collection, but I personally prefer most of his older CDs over this one. All I have to do is listen to his original Dance Me to the End of Love or Hallellujah and my heart goes soaring. The songs on this set sound technically fine and are impressive considering his age, but they lack something that used to incite the passion in me.    But I still love Leonard Cohen and he is the master of the poetry of the heart. If you like this CD, check out his older CDs. You will not be disappointed.

1400032717|5.0|Reading this book was like stepping inside the psyche of Dustin Hoffman's character, Ray, in Rain Man.  Incredibly revealing!  Funny, genuine and painfully honest, this story tells the tale of Christopher Swindon, a 15-year old \\"special\\" boy who, like boys his age, is curious as hell, but his autism channels his curiosity towards simpler matters like investigating the death of his neighbors' dog.  What begins as a seemingly innocent \\"murder mystery\\" morphs into a chain of fortuitous events leading to the discovery of several truths that will bring Christopher full circle and provide answers to a number of ambiguous questions.    Most infants and youngsters are very social individuals who thrive on contact with others in order to develop and grow.  In contrast, autistic children seem to exist in their own worlds living with the comfort of repetitive routines, peculiar behaviors, poor communication and a complete lack of social awareness. We learn as the story progresses of the mind of an autistic child - its incredible mind-boggling strengths (he is a math's & physics whiz and aces his A-Levels in Maths at 15!) and the hardships of seemingly simple tasks and human connections (he doesn't like to be held, touched or hugged, even by his parents).  What is most fascinating about this book is that it is narrated by Christopher himself.  In simplistic language and through the lens of a very candid reporter - we are accompanied through the pages of a quasi-detective story brimming with description and dotted with mathematical diagrams, puzzles and geometry proofs to lend force and credibility to \\"his book\\".      Christopher's eccentricities are beyond his control.  He is driven by a need for order.  He dislikes the colors yellow and brown.  He will not eat his food if different foods are touching, he has created a dictionary to define a \\"Super Good Day\\" from a \\"Bad Day\\" based on the order and color of cars he happens to experience that day, he doesn't like to be touched orhugged, even by his parents, he groans to create `white noise' when presented with a social situation he cannot deal with.  All these behaviors and more define Christophers' sphere of living.  Still, this young man is a force to be reckoned with; his irrationalities give birth to validations and a logic that you cannot argue with.  He single-handedly unravels the truth he knows not he is looking for and teaches us the simple grounds on which trust can come to exist or crumble like a wall of bricks.      Christopher immediately wins you over with the precious innocence that we can only still find in children.  He is funny, although unintentionally so, and his relentless devotion to his \\"mission\\" is adorable and heartbreaking all at once.  This is a very easy read that will evoke a great number of \\"aww's\\" from its readers.  Witty and highly amusing, it is quite an adventure to experience the world through a pair of astutely clear lenses.

1603580557|3.0|I'm not really sure how to classify this book.  It could be useful in a wide variety of situations, but it's such an introduction to the basics, that it probably won't take you very far.  I could see it championed as business management self-help, or maybe as side reading for an intro six-sigma course.      Overall, it reads more like a textbook and the state diagrams reminded me a lot of sentence diagramming done in grade school English classes - useful if you're going to work in the field, but otherwise not essential to understanding the content.    There were less than a handful of places where a concept was presented and I thought \\"huh, that's interesting\\", which is one of the key measures I use for judging these kind of books.    The 16-page appendix is actually an extremely good summary of the entire book.  You could get the whole idea from just reading that appendix and then referencing the main chapter for any further explanation you need.

B001VLXNLU|5.0|I was looking for another series to read while jonesing from reading the four Twilight books by Stephanie Meyer. [[ASIN:B000QRIGLW Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)]] As other reviewers have commented, I too was unsure about this book at first. Before the end though, I was hooked and in love with the series!     So if you loved Twilight, you might just love this series too. I can't wait for the next book to come out this fall!     As a sidenote, I've also been reading the self-published vampire books by Melanie Nowak, [[ASIN:B001C3VZEY Almost Human - paranormal vampire series - volumes 1, 2 & 3]]. I'm still on the first one. While the writing style is a little rough (sorry), the story is decent so far, and I think the series has potential. If you are a fan of vampire series like Twilight and House of Night, you might want to consider supporting this new author as well.     Back to Marked and the House of Night series in general- Love em! Just beware, they do all talk like teenagers, but the characters are loveable and memorable!

The story develops itself, starting in the early 1900 in southern rural Australia spawning several generations of the immigrant Cleary family until the year 1969, but it is centered in the life of the main character Meggie Cleary. As there is a great character development, characters are more important than the saga, the different chapters focus on several members of the Cleary family of various generations. It is one of a kind saga and one does not how it will end until the last page. Will the Cleary family stay on for generations to come or not ?
B001SN78JO|5.0|So you've read the other reviews - know about the plot - yes? No pun intended! To give you my take - I felt this movie was brilliant and totally unexpected - no overacting on Jim Carrey's part - no crazy antics (well other than the Ducati scene!) - just a good hearted movie with great music. Zooey Deschanel - how can you not fall in love with this girl? Get the soundtrack with her singing - Yes Man - the title track to the movie - very cool. Zooey is going to be a major Hollywood star and what's cool about that is she is so grounded - can't wait to see her next film!

0765348276|5.0|It must have been scary for established writers to see this come out from one so new
0385474547|5.0|This 1959 African novel is one of those small powerful books that held me captive until I finished reading it.  It didn't take long.  It is only 209 pages.  But I was completely won over from the first page and surprised that I had never heard of it before.  The author was born in Nigeria in 1930 and is currently a college professor at Bard College in upstate New York.  This book is required reading in many college courses today and considered a classic.<br /><br />Most of the book deals with Nigerian tribal life both before and after the coming of the missionaries.  We first meet Okonkwo, a well respected tribal member, in his prime.  He has three wives and several children and his plot of land is well tended and produces many yams.  The beliefs in their spirits are very real and I found myself seeing their world through their eyes.  I related to each of the people, especially Okonkwo, whose life was shaped by the shame of his father, and also his wife who bore ten children and had only one child who lived.  Some of the customs were indeed strange, and sometimes they were cruel.  Life was certainly not idyllic.  There was war.  There was murder.  And then, because of an accident, Okonkwo himself was banned from his tribe for seven years.  But there was social cohesion and a worldview that suited the way of life of the people.<br /><br />The first three-quarters of the book were set in this very unique Nigerian community who had never seen a white man.  And then the missionaries came.  Things changed.  And because the author had so fully created the tribal world, I personally felt the impact of the missionaries on the community through the eyes of the people, which was mostly that of confusion as their way of life was turned inside out.<br /><br />This is a fine book.  I loved every page and was sorry to see it end.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I was an old school Megadeth fan that left the fray sometime during the Cryptic Writings era.  Hadn't listened to Megadeth since because my musical taste changed.  But for some reason I decided to give United Abominations a listen and WOW, I was pleasantly surprised.  The album has overtones, both musically and thematically similar to Rust in Peace (my favorite 'Deth album).  The main difference is on R.I.P, Mustaine appears to be writing the lyrics for you to just listen and digest, but on UA it is almost as if Dave is talking directly to you, whether you agree with him or not.    Normally I don't like that approach, but I think it really works.  I've only had the album for two days and I have been listening to it non-stop.  I have to say it....Megadeth is definitely BACK.  Excellent album both musically and thematically.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I am a typical Austin buff...have all the movies & books. I often daydream about stepping through a door and ending up with Darcy rather than Elizabeth!     I do believe Miss Austin would have enjoyed this twist on her much loved story.     Extremely enjoyable movie which I will enjoy many many times.
B000002UY5|5.0|I remember when this album came out and the hit was \\"no rain\\". It was quickly put in category of those bands paying homage to Neil Young. After ten years or more I bought it and it blew my mind. Though I love \\"no rain\\" the remaining songs in the album are more in the tradition of Derek and Dominoes's Layla, with a hint of Black Crowes, and a pinch of Rod Stewart's \\"Every picture tells a story\\".  Wonderful mandolin and slide guitar on some tracks. The the way all the instruments weave in and out really reminds me of the Layla album.  When you sit down and listen to the whole album you realized how much YOU screwed up because this was not a one song band and not enough attention was paid to them.  The songs are tight and Hoon really belts things out. Just really a knockout album.
B001UW58YK|5.0|Many opinions have been posted here on the release of this CAUGHT IN THE ACT blu ray.  Why reissue something we have already seen?  Why no new live material from Michael Buble?  These can be valid questions but I also agree that they also have nothing to do with the quality of this item.  I shall try to offer my perspective and hopefully it will help you decide whether you wish to purchase it.<br /><br />First off, I in no way think Michael Buble is milking his fans.  Blu ray is an amazing gift to film and video enthusiasts.  A good blu ray transfer is miles above even the highest quality dvd in picture quality and audio presentation.  Due to the brilliance of blu ray almost everything that sold well on dvd is being reissued on blu ray for it is such an improvement.  I doulble dipped here and was thrilled when I heard it was coming on blu ray.<br /><br />I have a high end blu ray player, a hd television and a high end receiver.  An hd television is really a must to be able to fully appreciate blu ray.  I found the picture quality stunning.  Colors are crisp, flesh tones are amazing and the clarity crystal clear.  When Michael is on stage you can see every line on his face, every drop of sweat.  He appears as if he is in your room with you, as if you are actually at the concert.  This is the reason for blu ray.<br /><br />I must admit at first with the audio i had a problem finding the best level to play it at.  I found the volume varied greatly from the audience clapping to Michael singing.  I was surprised for DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 is an excellent source.  But then I remembered my receiver had different audio settings for music recordings so I changed the audio to CONCERT and it greatly improved but when I changed it to JAZZ the sound bacame impeccable.  The sound level between Michael and the orchestra was perfection and audience participation stayed at a greatly enjoyable steady level.  He runs into the audience, uses lighting a lot in his show and the picture holds strong thru it all.<br /><br />The performance most Michal Buble fans will already know.  First off, the concert is 120 minutes and not the 90 minutes it says in the item description by Amazon.  This is a stellar concert with a wide range of superb song selections.  Michael Buble is in true form with his pure artistry in the forefront.  I have seen him live twice and watching this brings me back again.  The dvd never really did for me.  Michael is an amazing performer.  He puts so much into his stylings of his songs including his effective body movements and his camaraderie with the audience is a joy to watch.  He is funny, energetic, sincere, humble and a true gentleman.<br /><br />Bottom line, you know Michael Buble and you probably already know this concert.  If you love the concert and have the equipment to enjoy blu ray at its finest I recommend double dipping here.  When I watch it on my 37\\" hd tv I am mezmerized and have no complaints.  I find this blu ray transfer a huge success..    The performance most Michal Buble fans will already know.

B00013F38K|4.0|Bruce Lee, the original choice for this series star, would have been so much better.  Not only was Lee first pick, he was the mind behind the series!  But in 1972, an Asian star on television?  Unthinkable.  And so we get this all too clearly American actor who fakes his Chinese-American origins with painfully slow speech, though he spouts genuine Buddhist philosophy.  Granted, Carradine did later become a grand master, but his moves for the television had to be slowed, and his notorious arrogance (at least for me) shows through.  Stellar performances were given by genuine Asian stars like Keye Luke, Philip Ahn, and others, and the series did ignite an interest in Kung Fu.  Still, I cannot help but think what Bruce Lee himself would have done with the role!
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean. But, whomever edited this movie, ought to be tarred and feathered! I think theyre over 7,000 cuts in this movie. I think it completely ruins the action, and storyline.<br />MTV + Asian cinema super fast edits, to make up for lousy choreography.<br />I find it just about unwatchable because of this.<br />Lets hope they wont make the same mistake again with the next outing.
B0002IQEHI|1.0|This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.  Unfortunately the DVD that I bought from Amazon marketplace is defective.  I didn't try to watch this until after the return period (so money spent was lost).  Midway through the film, when Cary Grant is at the auction house, the DVD starts showing just pixels, skips, and nothing further can be seen even when trying to advance to other scenes.  The DVD disc itself was brand new, no scratches, so there must have been something wrong with this batch.  I hope Warner re-releases this soon.
0061537934|5.0|I picked this book up at random in the bookstore while I was looking for something light to read.  I'll admit I was originally drawn by the dog on the cover, but it was the racing and the heart-wrenching story that made me decide to buy it.  To say I was not disappointed is an understatement.  I was hooked immediately by the very relatable experience of an aging canine companion as well as the fantastic writing.  The story was cute and funny.  The characters are flawed but very real.  The relationship between Enzo and Denny is beautiful.  I learned a little bit about life from a dog's perspective and about living in general.    My favorite quotes from the book are \\"That which you manifest is before you,\\" and \\"Gestures are all that I have.\\"  Stein does a really great job of developing the \\"racing as life\\" metaphor.  What could have been cheesy and contrived was actually very insightful.    The only complaint I have about this book is that it was hard to read the last few pages through the tears.  If you love dogs or cars or just great books, I wholeheartedly recommend this one.
B000059TEQ|3.0|When the book/movie were produced, about 40 years ago, the sexual revolution was new; thus the \\"God is dead\\" mentality and the \\"anything goes\\" sexual morality exhibited by the story's heroes would have seemed avant-garde. Of course, now such ideas have become mainstream--perhaps even quaint--even though the abandonment of God and the normalization of non-marital sex has hardly resulted in human flourishment.<br /><br />As I watched the movie, the following passages from the Bible came to mind:<br /><br />Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them. (Ephesians 6:4a)<br /><br />The fool says in his heart, \\"There is no God.\\" (Psalm 14:1)<br /><br />And he told them a parable, saying, \\"The land of a rich man produced plentifully,  and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?'  And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.  And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.'  But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'  So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.\\"  (Luke 12:16-21)
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I bought this video for my granddaughter and it was great!  It is a beautiful classic movie that I have loved for a long time, and now I can share it with her.  The DVD was in perfect shape and arrived almost faster than I could track it.
B0000560X0|5.0|Just found this DVD bargain on a bookshelve today, and grabbed it for less than 4, as I've never seen no George Benson live footage material out on the market... boy, I've never spent such ammount that good.<br /><br />It goes from big band to jazz, from jazz to symphinic arrangements, and then to funk back to jazz, ending up with some sort of salsa, so easily and captivating that it freakin' rocks.<br /><br />Believe me: it will surprise you but, in the case it doesn't, at least it won't disappoint you.<br /><br />GR8.
B000002KDS|5.0|This came out in 1971, the year I was born. So as you'd expect I didn't get into the album until much later, but I still love the thing. Aside from so-so \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" which everyone in the world I think loves except me, and the lacking but still decent title track, this album is perfect. You have to give Alice some credit for having balls for releasing a song called \\"Dead Babies\\" 38 years ago. Definitely shocking for the time, and a sign of the over-the-top songs to come on later albums.
1400032717|5.0|I have read this book a handful of times since it first came out and it is a great story every time. I think this book so beautifully transports you into the completely alternate universe of an autistic child's mind that it definitely deserves five shining stars.  The way in which the author was able to skillfully capture Christopher's perspectives in regards to his own life and in relation to so many other characters (his classmates, teacher, estranged parents, etc) was very impressive. Even if some parents of autistic children might disagree with the portrayal of the main character, autism is a spectrum disorder so I think Christopher is a very fair and accurate representation of some people's experiences. In any case, it's certainly a step in the right direction for such a book to gain so much popular appeal and critical acclaim because it sheds more light on this spectrum of disorders and their impact on children and their families. I think that increasing public awareness of these disorders, even if it is through a fictional character, can go a long way in terms of increasing sensitivity and reducing the fear, isolation, judgment, and misconceptions parents of autistic children often face.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|This is a incredible drama and performance that rings very true.<br />After all most of the wrestlers from 1980's are retired or still doing it just to survive is small little shows in the middle of nowhere.  And it's easy to see why so many wrestlers die (40 in ten years) it's a rough and physical art form that stresses the body to the max and the fact that so many use steriods and other drugs to stay working.  Sadly this movie features cocaine use and that is not usually the problem of wrestlers but it only adds to focus of a man who has hit the bottom in his life. Basically you have a man who selfish life has alennated his own daughter even and he comes to realize that he is doomed. (spoiler, do not read if you don't want to know the ending, but there is a ending as you know what's coming);  His heart is worn out by steriods and he decides to go out in the wring. So to say there is no ending is inncorrect.  Mickey Rourke did give a award winning performance here and I don't think anyone can deny this although some do obviously. I disagree with them , this is his finest hour and this is a great drama.  On blu ray the picture shines as usual with newer films and that's the only way to go when buying this movie.
B001RTP48G|5.0|Yesterday I received the special LIMITED edition of their new album YES from Amazon with bonus disc and it's friggin' AWESOME!!! if you love brilliant synth pop, you must get this version (with the bonus remix disc as it's worth the little bit extra). Tune I loved most was bonus version of the song, \\"More Than A Dream\\"[Magical Dub]. CHOON!!!!<br /><br />I have loved PSB since 1985, especially their remixes. These guys could sing the phone book and I'd be hypnotized by them! By the way, Purple's favorite song is PSB's \\"Euroboy\\".<br /><br />As Robin Leach [who sorta sounds like Neil Tennant] would say, \\"it's an album YEW MUST NAWT MISS!\\"
B001IBIQU6|5.0|....to assuage my fears that we had another \\"Exciter\\" on our hands with \\"Sounds of the Universe.\\"  It took about five listens to \\"get\\" this album, and it is another great DM album.  Before I go into more detail, allow me to add a bit of context, DM is my favorite band of all time (just ahead of NIN), and here is how I rank their albums up to now:    1.  Violator  2.  Black Celebration  3.  Music for the Masses  4.  Playing the Angel  5.  Ultra (perhaps their most underrated)  6.  Songs of Faith and Devotion  7.  Exciter  ....everything else....    Ok, so how will this list be modified to include SOTU?  I would say it is tied with Ultra for 5/6 place now.  I regard PTA as one of their most triumphant returns to classic form, and it seems that SOTU is a continuation of that.  Every track is solid here.

0141439793|5.0|\\"Northanger Abbey\\" has been my favorite novel since I first read it at 15, six years ago.  I haven't written a review of it until now because I hesitated to ascend to such presumption.  I, critique the great Miss Austen?  Unthinkable!  Yet I find I must put in my own glowing praise for this delightful novel.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have said, this is not Austen's most polished or refined work; it is not her greatest in terms of literary merit, scope or influence; it is not even her wittiest novel.  But I think it is her cleverest work.  The entire novel is a joke, and knows it.  The narrator is charmingly self-conscious, as is the book itself.  It is a novel that simultaneously parodies and praises novels.<br /><br />I must also mention that the heroine, Catherine Morland, is unique from every other Austen heroine in that her development as a character is solely for personal growth; she doesn't have to change or refine her mind or her character to be worthy of Henry Tilney because she already deserves her hero even before her self-actualization.  She does not have to learn to be humble or attentive or how to conduct herself; she only has to learn how to use her own good judgment, and to trust it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth uses spectacular photography and narrative to take you to places never before seen. The five disc set documents the beauty and fragility of our planet earth. Cinematography is stunning, and the content is daunting, beautiful and foreboding about the future of our earth and all it's inhabitants.
B001N26GFM|5.0|\\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is a devastating film, powerful and moving, with a startling and completely unexpected, unforgiving ending that sears the viewer and makes the whole movie incredibly significant. At the beginning we see a privileged Nazi family living in Berlin amid street scenes in which almost robotic people go about their business while in the background Jews are being rounded up for the concentration camps.<br /> The protagonist, an eight year old boy, Bruno, played superbly by Asa Butterfield is oblivious to what is going on around him. In his play world he is probably a fighter airplane soaring through the skies. Ironically he may be playing war games in his mind. He's a gentle, likable lad who has a loving family.<br />The father, a loyal Nazi, though gentle, kindly as well, is assigned to a post in the country as the commandant of a concentration camp. In their walled compound the boy and his mother see the smoke rising from the nearby high chimney. Their servant is an older man who under his work clothes wears striped pajamas. We are aware of these details through the eyes of the mother and her son.<br /> The boy wanders out of the yard and comes upon the barbed wire fence of the camp. He meets an eight year old, Shmuel, also in striped pajamas, who is sad and hungry. They grow to be friends. Bruno is unaware of Shmuel's plight. There is a crucial denial scene in \\"Striped\\" just as there was between the two boys in \\"The Kite Runner.\\"<br />The movie concerns the onset of loss of innocence, and makes real the horrors of the Holocaust. The cinematography is outstanding; the acting is peerless.<br />Can it be that the familial tunnel vision of human beings toward the plight of all humanity will be the downfall of the human species?<br />It's a very significant work, a human drama that should move viewers. There is no phony manipulative sentimentality in this work. Very highly recommended.
B001UE276A|5.0|I saw a friends box set today and I am in love! I can't wait to own my own. The box is made from quality durable material, the books are very very nice and the extra goodies are great. Not many artiest now a days release such quality nice things for their fans, Thank you DM!
1400064287|5.0|Marketing is storytelling, plain and simple. As marketers, we create perceptions, tales and anecdotes that we try to lodge in the minds of consumers - sometimes in the span of 30 seconds, the dimensions of a magazine page or length of a blog post.  By analyzing memorable stories, legends, ads, myths, etc., this book gives marketers an solid idea of how to better craft their own messages.    What I really like about this book is that it uses its own principles to make itself work. I always find myself rolling my eyes when a so-called marketing \\"expert\\" doesn't take their own advice.  The Heath Brothers do take their own advice, and have produced a book that is a physical embodiment of their six tenets: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories.  If, while reading this, you ever find yourself questioning whether or not these guys know what they're talking about, all you have to do is look down at the book your holding.  That'll be all the proof you need.
1401200923|5.0|This book doesnt set out to reinvent batman. All it sets out to do is strait up entertain you with a non-stop action thriller. Mission accomplished. Jeph Loeb is my favorite author. I highly suggest that you pick up long halloween and dark victory, written by him as well. The art in this just blew me away and was just as good as Loeb's fantastic writing. Be warned the ending does get pretty confusing but it is nothing a second read through can't fix. If you want a defining epic Batman tale I suggest that you pick up long halloween. If you want a mid-career batman tale that is just plain fun, Hush is for you.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Emotionally wrenching story of a German girl growing up in the birthplace of Nazism and the cost of Hitler's arrogance on not only Jewish people but everyday Germans. No one is all good or bad. Must read.

1401207529|3.0|I checked this book out after seeing that IGN had crowned it the best batman book of all time. I disagree completely. It wasnt bad by any means just didnt live up to the hype at all in my mind. Some things you should know: this book is short! It took me about 30 minutes to read and I highly doubt I will wish to read it again. Also, this book focuses on Jim Gordon more than Batman. This isnt a bad thing because I found Jim Gordon's story to be very compelling. Maybe the main reason I didnt like this book as much was because I had read Long Halloween before it. Long Halloween is easily the best batman graphic novel so I suggest you check that out. All in all this book was good and fun to read but it had no lasting impact on me. I will give it props for the burning building action sequence though because I found that scene both exhilarating and just plain awesome.  The rest of the book was so-so.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|In this post apocalyptic wasteland, one man is searching for something.  Fuel.

Im going to be honest, I wish my life was as tight as this movie.
B001UE276A|4.0|Another Solid Depeche Mode album, flanked by good additional content.  Not sure if I will ever wear the pins or put up a trifold poster in my room, let alone send postcards that are all included in the package.  To the music: an unusually rich amount of unreleased stuff and bonuses makes this box-set the ultimate Depeche Mode collector's/fan's treat.  The first CD contains the same content as the regular release and is a strong album, retro-sounding thanks to engineering of sounds.  Martin's songs hold up best. Dave's pen and melodies disappoint somewhat after some strong showing on Playing the Angel and Paper Monsters which flattens the album overall.  Notwithstanding, it is nice to see Depeche Mode and Martin's lyrics back in force with Biblical allusions and S&M twists.    The bonus material is solid through and through.  Firstly, the Demo-tracks, particularly from previous albums are intriguing, nostalgic and although a bit crude, a piece of Depeche Mode history that the hard-bit fan will not want to miss.  Secondly, the fresh tracks that did not make the album are a strong compilation and frankly, interchangeable with the some of the lesser tracks on the original album (such as Gahan's 'Come Back'). Intriguingly, we have the first Gore/Gahan joint track ever released which is surprisingly robust. Finally, the DVD with 5.1 Dolby album and documentaries and videos is fine icing on the cake with probably the most complete, candid illustration of the album-making process.  The interviews reveal some of the bands current thoughts and future ambitions.  The documentaries are a rare insight into Depeche Mode and the producer had intertwined clips from Black Celebration album recording which is very enjoyable.    Good show, DM! (BTW-what does Fletch do?)
B000TEPKAW|4.0|Who doesn't love heroes.  Some grumpy old grump that's who.  I think it is the best of the few songs that ever carried over to the mainstream as ch-ch- changes, golden years and young americans get on my nerves and all the good glitter stuff was rarely played on the airwaves.
0385504209|5.0|Don't let the 2-dimensional characterizations scare you off. This book quickly turns into the page turner of the decade. And not just because of the skillful way Brown ends each chapter with one cliffhanger better than the last, or surprises you by playing on your assumptions. Read it for the history lessons alone. Forget the movie and read the book.

0670020478|2.0|I decided to get this book after seeing Robinson's inspiring TED speech (search online if you haven't seen it)    I have rarely been so disappointed by a book.      There's virtually nothing in the book that can be seen as being useful or helpful.  It's all celebrity worship.  Page after page describes the lives of millionaires and famous people and how they are doing what they love.      If anything, this book achieves the opposite of what Robinson is supposed to be about.  If he had documented the lives of ordinary people who are in their element, who do work they love, he could have provide hope, role models and examples.      He may as well have written a book about getting rich and documented the lives of lottery winners.  Yes, you can play the lottery and win too.    I find it hard to understand the positive review of this book and half suspect these are all friends, colleagues and plants extolling the books virtues.     Don't waste your money.
0307269191|3.0|Read his short stories or novels. This is a runner's diary; there is not much related to writing or literature or his development as a writer, if that is what you're hoping to find. It also reads as a self-help book but it's not much in that respect either.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|There's not much to say about this product.  It's Disney.  What else is needed for a review?    I got this for my granddaughter, and she's all about all things Disney.  She has every song memorized (which I'm treated to each evening as we walk the dog), and half the dialogue from all the Disney movies.  She loved the Pinocchio Platinum Edition, and would recommend it to anyone and everyone, especially to all her \\"butcher-movie\\" fan buddies.
B000002UHG|5.0|Excellent music. Richard Wright did a wonderful job.  Well written songs, and he was an excellent composer.  Everything from the cover to the words to the sound, Broken China is a look into the feelings of a remarkable man.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I love the books that continue Jane's stories, but this modern movie is a terrific idea. Elizabeth in present-day England is something I've never wondered about, but I have thought of all the women in love with Colin Firth/Darcy wanting to go back in time. To before-Netherfield Derbyshire. Our heroine Amanda from present-day London is one of these. There is a scene where she asks this Darcy to go in the pond and get his shirt wet..... well. Hot and hysterical. Amanda tries to direct all the Austen characters in the way the book would go, but you'll have to check out the results yourself. It wasn't just a happy romantic or funny movie, I also caught myself feeling anxious for the outcome of the movie. Thus it became even more enjoyable, with tension in the plot that makes it great.
159102594X|5.0|The Blade Itself is an excellent read, and kicks this trilogy off with a bang. While the characters are not wholly likable, I felt their imperfections only added to their verisimilitude -- they actually seem to live and breathe. The plotting is spot on, and there's plenty of action and some near palpable suspense. As with A Game of Thrones, The Blade Itself transcends genre and rates as a very good book, not just a fantasy.
B001HN697M|5.0|loved, loved, loved this movie........for anyone who saw underworld 1, and by theend of the movie was rooting for the lycans, this is your movie........<br /><br />michael sheen in the role of lucian has an animal attraction (no pun intended) that will just drive you wild......very sexy man......<br /><br />i am a huge fan of the underworld series, but this one is my favorite, by far.....
B0018SWA56|4.0|Great sequel to \\"Something Borrowed!\\"  Makes you fall in love with Darcy like you loved Rachel. With help from some friends, Darcy finds her strength when she's at the end of her rope!!
0385340567|1.0|The focus of the story are two towns 15 miles apart in the high plains of Colorado.  The \\"hero\\" rolls through one, gets hassled by one of the towns' cops and decides to stay around just to vex them.  The former MP officer is no genius but he is sensitive of any slight.  The main character is really the road between the two towns.  The hero goes back and forth about 50 times and each trip is described in loving detail.  He walks at night and during the day, he drives the route both day and night, he hitch hikes, he sneaks, he takes a police car, he might use a jetpack and a pogo stick; my mind began to wander as a I fought through this endless tale. Christians, the US military and small towns whose police officers don't put out for the hero are the bad guys.  On the other hand married Police officers from small towns who do put out for Reacher are good guys.  Stay away an achingly dull book.
B000089RVX|5.0|I keep a few CDs in my car for long drives and this made the cut -- I can pop it in and listen to the whole thing without skipping through tracks.  Anyone who remembers sitting through bad songs on a tape deck (8-track or otherwise) would agree that an album which is good all the way through is a good find.<br /><br />In these days of digital music and 'album decomposition,' it is rare to find albums that fit together as well as this one.  I have been guilty of purchasing individual tracks from albums because those are the parts that I like. Maybe I am feeding the beast -- why would artists bother to make albums cohesive if people are going to simply cherry-pick tracks?<br /><br />I had heard a few tracks on the radio and was going to purchase 'Bring Me To Life' and 'Going Under' because they are the more popular and more frequently heard on the radio.  Fortunately, I took the time to listen to the previews of the other tracks and decided that I wanted to hear the whole album.<br /><br />I am not really into the 'Goth Rock' genre, but I am not opposed to it either. Amy Lee's vocals are excellent, as is the instrumental work. I enjoy this album and would recommend it to anyone with an open mind. For what it is worth, it has been a several years but I still listen to the whole album periodically.
B000BC8STM|3.0|my only problem with this video is you dont get to see the entire concert from start to finish.....the vhs version you do.......on dvd you get the cutdown version that was on tv......<br /><br />the extras are great, but if im purchasing a live concert, i wanna see it as tho' i was in the audience......not chopped up and put in a different form......
B001PA0FFO|5.0|A lot of plays don't adapt well to the screen (\\"Love! Valour! Compassion!\\" anyone?); here we have a successful play being directed by the playwright. What could go wrong? Actually, NOTHING! I still don't understand why Cherry Jones didn't repeat her Tony-winning role, but the Sister Aloysius of Meryl Streep is as centered as it could be. The entire cast is flawless, and the film allows some latitude in location that the play didn't. Very talky, intelligent, fast-paced, and thoroughly focused, I haven't been so impressed in a long time. Some say Amy Adams didn't deserve her Oscar nom, but I strongly disagree. Also, young Joseph Foster, as the catalyst of the controversy, is a talented young man, and I wish him well. I recommend this film highly. I can't remember when I was so impressed by an acting ensemble. Not a weak one in the bunch. A real treat!
015206396X|4.0|Overall Rating: 3.5 / 5 stars    In the debut novel that is overflowing with an iffy plot and a confusing world, Kristin Cashore manages to make her characters shine.  I almost put the book down after thirty pages, so oddly worded was her narration and so confusing was the concepts she was passing off.  In the first section of the book, she fell headfirst into the horribly common plague of `action first, explain important details that allow the reader to understand the action later'.      Then she stopped focusing on plot for a moment and her characters made their move.  Ten pages from being destined to be returned to the library as a failed experiment, suddenly I fell in love with Katsa and Po and (eventually) Blitterblue and even the wretched Giddeon.  I was determined and destined to worm my way through the novel if for no other reason than to find out what ultimately happens to them.  Giggling at their lifelike and boisterous conversations, my breath catching at angsty moments, loving their growth and change as characters...     All the while, rolling my eyes at the convoluted and seemingly random plot.  The penultimate ending is abrupt, leaving us with the knowledge that there is more to the story... but most definitely not enough for a sequel without adding in some new twist.  The essential `plot' to the story involving the Mad King certainly is wrapped up... but in a novel based almost completely on character, the character's strings are left hopelessly up in the air.  A mere twenty more pages detailing Katsa's journey back to Middluns to face with her uncle would have summed up the novel perfectly.  (Note that there is apparently a sequel to be released in late 2009 called 'Fire')    Borrow (don't buy) this book and slog through the first thirty pages.  I promise you that once you get your teeth into the characters, their boundless spirits will echo off the pages, drag you into the story, and will hold a knife to your throat until you finish this.  I hope Kristin Cashore can do better with her plot next time, for she has a real Grace when it comes to characterization and will create some truly memorable stories.
B001V9LRV0|4.0|( THE MOVIE )...In 1994 expanding the Woodstock Movie to four hours was the right decision.  Something new was needed for the twenty-fifth anniversary of the festival.  So now in the year 2009 the movie in DVD should be released back in original 1970 form as we saw it in the theaters and drive-ins.  The extra footage could go on separate discs.  The idea also to add new music to old tapes is an outrage.  Once again in reissue dept. Woodstock loses  to Monterey Pop.  They got the Blade Runner movie right after thirty years,but Woodstock blows it again.  Egos won't allow us to watch what was one of the two best Rock movies ever, the way we remember it.  We never needed inter \\"bleep-bleep mission\\".  It was a visual/musical piece of art the way it was.  Somebody really creative would have released \\"Woodstock Movie 2\\" using Jefferson Airplane, Canned Heat, Janis Joplin, more Sly & The Family Stone, Jimi Hendrix, other artists, fans comments and the rest.  Sometimes less is more.  That was the case with Woodstock. As for the rest of this box. ( MISSING )...The VHS \\"Lost Performances\\" ( C.S.N.Y.,  Melanie, The Band, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Sly and Arlo Guthrie ).  Why?  No extra Ten Years After music or Jimi Hendrix from his DVD.  All of this is a huge disappointment. Here's the good part. ( UNTOLD STORIES )...Never before seen quality throughout in single screen format.  The Grateful Dead and Creedence nail down some jams finishing strong.  Canned Heat, Paul Butterfield and Johnny Winter are impressive in slow and rocking blues.  The edge going to The Bear and Alan Wilson's  boogie doing  \\"On The Road Again\\". Sha Na Na booked problably as a joke pulls off the biggest surprise winning over the hippie crowd on \\"Teen Angel\\".  The rest of the performances come off like a good FM radio segment, but don't challenge what is already available in the director's cut.  The interviews are interesting only the first time around.( COLLECTOR'S ITEM )...As a box set ( though incomplete ) that includes a Life Magazine 1969 pictured booklet and souvenir ticket is still a must  for lovers of this movie. Medium level fans or past rockers who graduated from Classic Rock to others genres don't bother.hat includes a Life Magazine 1969 pictured booklet and souvenir ticket is still a must  for lovers of this movie.

B000BJ7BCK|5.0|I had seen this movie before and sent it to my 8 year old niece.  She fell in love with it and, according to my sister, has watched it a million times.
1600242197|5.0|I had read this book previously but decided to buy the audio book as I have a new husband who does not read much. We spend many hours traveling in the pickup and I wanted him to hear this story.  He is a Purple Heart VN veteran.  The story was even better by hearing it.  It is truly amazing to consider what the human body and spirit can endure.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I absolutely adore this cd.  I dig almost every track, except Brown Eyes because it's slow.  Great dance music, great fun.  I highly recommend it!
B0009LNRLE|5.0|I could make a big list of bands that completely ripped this album off. This was just as influential on pysch/stoner rock as Hawkwind or Sir Lord Baltimore. If you are looking into the roots of bands like old Monster Magnet you need this.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Pretty Woman is one of my favorite movies. The fact that the wealthy character Edward Lewis uses a \\"car phone\\" instead of a Blackberry does not make this film any less relevant to a 21st century audience. A timeless classic, it is just as poignant now as it was almost 20 years ago when it first came out.<br /><br />This is the film that made Julia Roberts' career. Before Pretty Woman, she was virtually unknown as an actress. Roberts was nominated for an Oscar (which I personally think she should have won) for playing the versatile ever-evolving character of Vivian Ward. The fact that Vivian starts out as a prostitute in this movie apparently throws off some reviewers who allow that one fact to prevent them from appreciating the story's innate value. The moral of Pretty Woman is: don't judge a book (or a person) by its cover.<br /><br />Yes, this movie is Cinderella-ish, but that is part of its charm. Richard Gere plays the rich handsome \\"prince\\" and Julia Roberts is the street girl who wants to be rescued. I'm sure feminists would criticize Pretty Woman to no end, but WHO CARES?!?! There is a reason movies like this remain so popular. If there was an Oscar for \\"On Screen Chemistry,\\" Gere and Roberts would have won it. The sex scenes are incredibly romantic and very tastefully done- no excess nudity.<br /><br />The quality of the 15th anniversary DVD is very good. The Director's commentary is amusing. You will learn some interesting tid bits about the making of the film; however, I wish there was commentary from Roberts and Gere. The primary value of purchasing this DVD is that there are some extended scenes that don't appear in earlier versions, but many of the \\"deleted scenes\\" mentioned in the commentary are not included which was disappointing.
0312360266|2.0|Ever since being bitten by the Twilight saga,I've been on the prowl for more vampire lit(yes,I know,the puns are terrible but I couldn't resist),so when I found Marked and read the blurb on the back it sounded intruiging--sort of like Harry Potter with fangs.Little did I know what disappointment was awaiting me.What makes it so tragic is that the actual CONCEPT is  wonderful.A special school for learning about how to be a  vampyre is a great idea,and the authors really could have gone somewhere with it.I also liked the little details about the vampyre culture;their affinity with cats,the magical tattoos they get,and the way they get 'powers'(sort of like the special abilities of Stephenie Meyer's vampires)        Unfortuneately,the Casts ruined the book by making it just...bleh.The cursing,for starters.It was INSANE!Although I don't like swearwords,I can tolerate a few sprinkled throughout the book.In Marked,however,there was typically at least one cuss word on each page--most of the time far more that one! I can't remember whether the F-bomb was used,but pretty much all the other curses were.Even the word 'fag' was used to describe a gay person.I have to put up with enough of that garbage at school;I don't want to encounter it in my books!          Another problem I had with Marked was the sexuality it contained.There was a seriously disgusting scene in which two characters had oral sex(yuck,yuck,yuck),and sexual remarks were made throughout the book,as well as a scene in which Zoe,the heroine,makes out with her boyfriend.        There was also some drug use in a chapter in which two of Zoe's human friends sneak onto campus and are,as she remarks'wasted,high,and drunk.'        My final problem with Marked was the occult and somewhat anti-Christian message.Being a Christian myself,I'm not big on paganism and Goddess-worship rituals,both of which are found in this book.I was  extremely offended by the way Christians(Marked calls them the People of the Faith,but it's obvious they're Christians) are portrayed as close-minded fools,and disturbed by Zoe thinking that a pagan ceremony was more of a religious experince than church.I hope I don't sound like one of those nuts who think non-Christians should go burn.I'm not--people have a right to believe what they want.But the last thing we need is for people to turn to the occult--it gets them nowhere.       Marked was an EXTREMELY disappointing experience for me.It really had a lot of potential.It's a shame the authors followed the current fad of making books trashy and cheap.Ah,well,that's the way the cookie crumbles,I guess.
0452289963|5.0|I am in a book club based on this work and have shifted my perspective on many things. I was able to identify the \\"role\\"  I  was playing into and why... Very good book... Enjoy
B00005614M|5.0|The pieces are short and interesting. This is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by all. Very accessible music that can be actively listened to or allowed to fade into the background for ambience. I love it.
B001RTP48G|4.0|Very good record as far as music is concerned. The sound is really bad. One of the worst I've heard from Pet shop boys    Music *****  Sound *
B000Q79HS8|4.0|I agree that you should watch the other movies in this serious. Hey why not get a large bowl of popcorn and watch them all together.     I think Matt Damon is a good actor and not bad on the eyes. Overall it has a good cast.  Lots of action and intrigue.  Not totally predictable which is a good thing.      I tend to like movies in this genre so it was an easy choice for me.
B00000I14Z|4.0|I'm not a Jazz expert, so I don't feel quite right giving this album 4 stars since it's so highly rated by the experts. I like it, the tracks are light and easy to listen to. They're also varied and interesting enough to warrant many replays. However, as good as they are, I don't rate them as highly as some of the other works to which I've given 5 stars.
B0000025H4|5.0|This is a vintage live recording of a Judas Priest concert, a must have for a Priest fan or metal fan in general.
B000002ADT|5.0|The track \\"So What\\" would justify paying for this album on its own, but there are 4 other excellent pieces to sweeten the deal. This one is especially good on speakers or headphones with a lot of bass, crank it up and listen to that double bass!
B0026GBIB6|5.0|Why are some people reviewing this a 3 or worse? Either they aren't true DM fans, probably purchased because of the price, or they are waiting for Violator part two. When are those who follow DM going to get it? The group is not going to make another Violater or Music for the Masses. Why must everyone compare them to their older CD's?     This CD finds them returning to a more electronic sound and it works awesomely. This is a solid, very solid, CD. Most if not all songs are B+ or higher with songs like Peace, Perfect, In Sympathy, Wrong, Corrupt, and In Chains rated at A to A+. Everyone should at the very least be happy that DM is still making excellent music and that they are still around. Their music matters and they have influenced, and continue to influence, thousands of artists.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Not too shabby if you're into English \\"eye-candy\\". More focus on the High Stakes Game would've given the plot even MORE substance.
B0015AARJI|5.0|You already spent a few hundred on the system which comes with the original ps3 controller why not invest in a 2nd control from the same maker Sony and save yourself all the hassle with after market stuff, which might not able to perform up to par with the original.  this 2nd controller is great!!!
0525421033|4.0|When I first heard about Gayle Foreman's new book, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  It is the kind of story that is both painful and beautiful all at the same time.<br /><br />Mia is a talented young woman ready to move on from high school, although she is not sure of the direction she wants to move.  She has options but each of them has a price.  She is an amazing cellist and wants to pursue a career in music but isn't sure she wants to leave friends and family particularly, boyfriend Adam.<br /><br />All of her options are halted, altered, or changed forever in the flash of an automobile accident. The surrealist aftermath is Mia trying to make sense of the results of the accident from the altered state of hovering between life and death. The detached view that she has is something we all have wondered about, imagined, and many have either had a first hand experience or a close loved one that hovered in such a state.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book for YA on a very sensitive topic of life and death and how the choices we make can impact everyone we touch.  It is a story that will hold you until the last page and leaves room for you to make your own choices.  Teen librarians will be glad to have this book to recommend.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|After hearing them play 'the hit' on David Letterman and then the Grammies,  I decided to buy my first Coldplay album.  Having the immensely talented Brian Eno as producer was a wonderful surprise for me and you can hear his eclectic footprint all over this wee beastie.  This album grabs you from the first song and holds your attention throughout the entire album.  It's actually constructed as an album, in the old school tradition.    Even my seasoned musician friends and relatives who would never buy a Coldplay album had to admit that Coldplay moved from a Conan O'Brian punchline to an established band and talented songwriters in their worldview(although it took quite a bit of arm-twisting to get them to insert in slot).  Look for musical references from the 60's right on up to the British pop of today.    Also, try and find video from Letterman and the Grammies to see the Huge Bass Drum being pounded like it is the last defense against the Mongol Hordes!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love actually is just the best movie.  I got it for my son who is ver picky, and he loved it as well.  There is so much in it.  So much human, so much about love in a real way from silly to intense.  Watch it over and over.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|In speaking for my father, he has enjoyed it very much.He has other albums  of hers as well. He loves how she sings, and plays the piano at the same  time.
B001B4JVKE|5.0|I stumbled onto Katie Melua a few weeks ago while looking for something else and am so glad I did. Her voice is like a songbird and I enjoy her song writing too. She reminds me somewhat of the late Eva Cassidy and her duets with her are stunning. Why she isn't better known in the U.S. baffles me then it dawned on me..she can actually sing.    This CD/DVD set is a great introduction to her work, kind of a greatest hits or best of so far. I think the DVD that comes with this set is a European version but it plays fine in my DVD player and laptop. I hope she comes to the U.S. soon it will be a must see concert for me!
B001PA0FFO|4.0|Meryl Streep portrays an inflexible nun, dedicated to the job of keeping things the way they've always been, and staying fully in charge of the school and convent which she leads.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a priest with great compassion for his parishioners, and especially for a young altar boy whose father beats him on a regular basis.  Streep's character chooses this very compassion to challenge the priest and, using an incident reported by another nun, she works to discredit him and banish him from the parish.  Streep and Hoffman are wonderful actors and without their performances this would have been a much less powerful movie.  My husband and I had diametrically opposed views of what the truth was in the gray areas of the film, which says to me that it was a wonderful springboard for discussion.  I did feel that it was a little slow at times and that there should have been more proof for Streep's character to act as she did.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I have been a fan of this amazing show ever since it premiered in October of 2001, and to date, it continues to evolve and flourish into one of the best stories ever told: The life of Clark Kent & his journey to become Superman!    In this season, we see many twists and turns that are quite epic. We are introduced to DOOMSDAY: the only known villain in DC comics that has killed Superman. Things get very intriguing with the introduction of Doomsday in the form of Davis Bloom, Doomsday's human alter ego.     Furthermore, we are also introduced to many more DC villains/heroes, such as Zatanna, the magician, as well as the Legion of Super Heroes, Faora (Zod's wife), Plastique, Livewire, Parasite, Maxima, Bruno Manheim, Toyman, and of course: DOOMSDAY.    Chloe gets a front burner storyline as well as she becomes involved with the Doomsday arc and protecting Clark against him. Tragedy comes for everyone in the spectacular season finale: DOOMSDAY in which the lives of every character is thrown into turmoil and chaos.    Probably the most best arc of this season is the Red-Blue-Blur arc involving Lois and Clark. Lois and Clark's romance begins and it becomes evident in \\"Bride\\" as they almost share a lip-lock. Erica Durance and Tom Welling's sizzling chemistry has made everyone fall in LOVE with Clois, aka, Clark and Lois. Hats off to the pair of them.    This amazing DVD set includes all 22 episodes of Season 8 with two commentaries on two episodes as well as some other excellent features, such as the origins of Doomsday and deleted scenes.    Some of the best episodes out of this season to look into are:     Doomsday: In the biggest cliffhanger ever, Clark and Doomsday face off in a major fight with 2 major deaths of beloved characters.    Bloodline: Lois becomes possessed by Zod's wife and goes on a rampage.     Infamous: Clark reveals his secret to the world & becomes a celebrity! Nuff' said.    Hex: Zatanna the magician casts Chloe's wish and switches bodies with cousin Lois!     Eternal: We are treated to Davis' background and how he arrived on Earth as Doomsday.     Stiletto: Lois Lane becomes a super heroine in Metropolis!     Injustice: Tess' assembled army of meteor freaks goes up against Doomsday.    Bride: Chloe and Jimmy's wedding gets destroyed by Doomsday kidnapping her.     Identity: Clark is introduced to an identity for himself.     Committed: Lois and Clark are held hostage where they admit their true feelings of love for one another!     Get some popcorn ready and immerse yourself with those spectacular episodes that will amaze you!    Smallville has been renewed for Season 9, with a possible 10th season since rumour has it that Tom Welling signed a two year contract when he signed on for S9. Smallville continues to entertain us and it shows us why is still is the number one show out there! Buy this DVD set now, you will NOT be disappointed!    FIVE STARS FROM ME!!
B0007TKNII|4.0|Produced and overseen by auteur Andrew Lloyd Webber, \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" may go down as the definitive film version of the oh-so-often-filmed musical. The music is as beautiful as ever (\\"All I Ask of You\\", \\"Music of the Night\\" \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\"), acting and singing is very decent, not detracting from the overall romantic and mysterious mood, and - perhaps the most typical for the film is its lavish, almost vain, production. You bet it must have suited Mr Webber, known for his perfectionism, fine. The only setback is that the film came perhaps a little too late in time. Had it come a decade or two earlier (maybe when Webber's then-wife Sarah Brightman's crossover career was in its prime), it would have scored higher critical success and more of the deserved awards. Still, this 2004 version offers quite much and more than two hours for modern musical lovers will be by no means lost.
B000M343BM|5.0|From the writer of \\"The Sting\\" and its atrocious sequel comes a story of the most ragtag people ever to assemble on a baseball diamond. Charlie (as in Sheen) & Tom Berenger star in \\"Major League.\\" Co-starring Dennis Haysbert, Corbin Bernsen, deliciously villainous Margaret Whitton, real-life baseball announcer Bob Uecker and featuring future stars Rene Russo & Wesley Snipes in their feature film debuts, this movie is a HOME RUN. Combining sharp dialogue with the antics & fun of baseball, this movie is a classic. Rated R, but should've been PG-13 (hey, the language is tamer than an episode of \\"The Sopranos\\"; no offense to Tony). There's also an alternate ending, with optional commentary. Classic f---ing fun.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the sequel, which was made in 1994. Though the main cast reunites, Wesley Snipes is missing and has been replaced by Omar Epps as Willie Mays Hays, for whatever reason. Plus, Rene Russo appears in a wasted cameo, when she had more scenes in the first movie. I read somewhere that the director (David S. Ward, who wrote both movies) was embarassed by the language in the first movie, so he toned the sequel down for a PG rating, and this idiotic decision is noticeable, particularly in a scene where a catcher says, \\"Goldarn it to heck.\\" Stupid writer & director. Not only is that how baseball players talk (in the 1st movie), but it's also part of what made the first movie so enjoyable. Randy Quaid is enjoyable, but not good enough to save what was toned down to a PG rated movie. I've gotta give \\"Major League II\\" 2/1/2 stars.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Really this was quite a funny movie. I'm not really a fan of Jerry Stiller, and I'm old enough to remember his parents comedy antics. But, this was FUNNY beyond belief. Watch until you see Tom Cruise's transformation in the film. You'll feel bad for Katie Holmes if he actually turns out like that!!! Watch the DVD you'll laugh your butt off!!!
B000002KAT|5.0|Good album I enjoy listening to it especially the title track \\"Astral Weeks\\" very good song.
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|I am very busy.  I stumbled over this doing some oddball multitask. I was stopped in my tracks.  I'm a 53 year old thrice-divorced old hippie that has more money than I know what to do with!  LOVE THIS BAND!  (DOING HEAD BOP))))))))(:::::::)
B001CC7PN0|5.0|This is a chick flick. It's a wonderful Cinderella story that tweaks the historical imagination! The cinematography is beautiful! I'd recommend to everyone, even though I'm pretty certain that the guys won't be interested.
B001UE276A|5.0|The packaging is beautiful, the album is fantastic and the contents are just perfect for any Depeche Mode maniac.  I would say this album is more vocally driven and an excellent example of the human voice as an instrument.  It sounds like the best parts of Violator and Exciter to me.  The extras are fantastic.  The books were put together with great care, the buttons are great, the postcards are beautiful, and the box itself is very sturdy and is a great collector keepsake.  The CD contents are just amazing.  Especially the disc of Demos.  This package is worth every penny at Amazon's price.  If you or a loved one just can't seem to get enough of Depeche, grab this box set before it's gone.
B000FFJYB6|5.0|This is one of the very best movies I have ever watched.  I thought the entire cast was wonderful.  The story is true, based on the life of a an only child, a boy, whose first dog helped him to grow.  It's really funny at times, laugh out loud funny.  I like the adult characters as well, especially Kevin Bacon as the dad, and Luke Wilson who plays Dink Jenkins the 'Golden Boy\\" who went to war and came back feeling defeated.  I think the scene between Bacon and Wilson is very touching. Frankie Muniz is simply adorable, and he was so believable.  Can't leave out Diane Lane, she is such a pretty woman, and I really enjoyed her character as well.  She seemed to be somewhat different than most of the women in that time period.  Story of love, friendship, family, and loss.  I have recently bought the book to read as well.  Advisable to have a box of tissue on hand, I wept a great deal the last 20-30 minutes of this movie.  Though I always loved my dog, after watching this, I had a whole new appreciation of that very special relationship.  To me this is one of those movies you have to watch from time to time...the message never gets old.
B000007R13|5.0|The Allman's performance at the peak of their greatness....I won't waste anyone's time trying to describe what an incredible band they were during the Duane Allman/Berry Oakley era. This remastered DTS recording....Listen for yourself. This has to be the definitive version of this five star classic live album. I've owned the Mobile Fidelity Orginial Master Recordings on both vinyl and the 14Ct Gold CD, (the vinyl still kicks). The Deluxe Edition (includes the bonus tracks \\"Mountain Jam\\" and \\"Drunkin' Hearted Boy\\") is very good. But the sound is no match for this DTS version. It simply doesn't get better than this.     Take it from one who was at The Fillmore East on March 13, 1971. This is the Mother-Loade, The Grand Wazoo, The Holy Grail and more. Trust me...Toss this baby into your DVD player, get comfortable and turn down the lights. You'll soon be screemin' \\"PLAY ALL NIGHT\\"!!! I know I did.

B001PA0FFO|3.0|I think in general the actings were reasonably good.  The plot was a cheap shot like the writer was finishing up the story in a hurry at the end.  Not a movie that will make a strong impression.
B001DEVZUG|5.0|although i enjoyed disc one, neither the original disc 2 nor the replacement disc 2 would play in any of the five CD players i tried it in...so i had to return both CD sets...if anyone out there can explain this to me and solve the problem, would appreciate the info...
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I'm not enjoying this CD.  The vocals are too breathy, the selections too brooding, and I'm frankly bored with DK working the sexy vocal shtick.  She is a phenomenal pianist, but seems to have traded those chops for vocals.      Her foray into the Jobim millieu should have ended with \\"The Look of Love.\\"  On this CD, her phrasing seems awkward, contrived and lacking conviction, and her attempt at portugese in track #7 is difficult to endure.  I enjoy her most when she's interpreting standards, e.g., CDs \\"Love Scenes\\", \\"All For You\\", \\"Only Trust Your Heart.\\"  Pop tunes (at least here) are not her strength, as she never seems to find her place on \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" and \\"Walk On By.\\"      While I'm not sure that Elias' \\". . . Sings Jobim\\" (see my review) is a better offering, it does have one advantage in that, while Elias' vocals are annoying, they do not overshadow her peerless work at the keyboard.    Back to basics, Diana, please!
B000002WMH|5.0|This five CD box set features all of Elvis Presley's 1950s master recordings.  Besides the master recordings, there are a few other things here.  There are excerpts from a press conference given by Elvis when he went into the army.  There are also demo tapes, alternate takes and some live recordings.  Just about everything Elvis recorded in the 1950s was great, so you can't go wrong with this.
B00243FQFA|4.0|Wonderful season 5 for Stargate: Atlantis! Some standout episodes have already been mentioned but the 2 part mini arc with Dr. Daniel Jackson as well as the entire cast was total entertainment and needs to be mentioned again. 'Vegas' was also something special.    I admit to still being ticked off that Stargate: Atlantis was cancelled. Yes a movie sounds great but I feel that the season suffered because of the axe hanging over their heads. This show did not deserve cancellation. The ratings were still solid and there were still plenty of places to go with these characters.    Why bother watching this new show if the plug could be pulled at any time?  What is the point in investing the time when the bean counters could pull the plug on something good?     I've been a fan of Stargate: Atlantis since the first episode and I miss seeing these characters in new adventures. I'm still in mourning...

B001UEBHYS|2.0|Not to sound cliche, but I probably would have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the book (which is terrific). I think the movie mirrors some of the violence/horror of the book.  However, the situations presented in the movie are TOTALLY different than the book and the characters portrayed in the movie are much less compelling.
0684803356|5.0|Hemingway published FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS in 1940, just after the end of the Spanish Civil War. Surely, one of Hem's goals in writing this novel was to capture in fiction the full human and political complexity of this war, which was, for a time, the great international cause. This may explain why this novel, despite its great craftsmanship and virtuosity, reads a little long. Hem, you see, had to get everything in.<br /><br />IMHO, the best feature of this terrific book is its wonderful Spanish characters. These participate in the war, which is a great cause for Robert Jordan, the novel's protagonist. But they participate because of family loyalty, fascist war crimes, or class rage and soldiering is mostly peripheral to their personalities. What the reader remembers is not their support of the Republic but the integrity of Anselmo, the dignity of Fernando, the humor of Agustin, the simple loving sincerity of Maria, the harsh surface of Pilar, and the murderous treachery of Pablo. These are, basically, ordinary Spaniards caught in a gruesome tragedy, not ideologues or idealists who are transformed or energized by the cause.<br /><br />Hem also handles Robert Jordan skillfully. When Jordan first appears, he seems to be concerned only with his duty to the cause, which, on this mission, is to blow up a bridge. But quickly, Jordan meets the loving Maria. Then, through this relationship, Hem explores Jordan's thoughts and feelings on life and death. While Jordan is not an extraordinary man with breakthrough thoughts, he is an extraordinary character who, thanks to Maria, both examines the rationale for risking his life and identifies the beauty of what may be its final few days.<br /><br />There are many great scenes in this novel. Among my favorites are the appearance of the planes and Pilar, at fireside, telling the story of her matador lover. And--surprise!--Hemingway is funny in FWTBT, not in a hilarious Robin Williams style, but with the dexterity of a witty companion. With Hemingway's misogyny, competitiveness, alcoholism, and depression now raised to critical prominence, I was surprised to see that the man could be a good guy.<br /><br />FWTBT is number 74 on the Modern Library's list of 100 Best Novels... a bit low in my estimation.ay's misogyny, competitiveness, alcoholism, and depression now raised to critical prominence, I was surprised to see that the man could be a good guy.

B00064X3FO|5.0|This was the album that opened up to the american listener.  I acually sat down and listen to whole album for the first time. I was very surprized how good this album really was.  The best was yet to come through his later album releases.  I recommend this album as a good starter for the Elton John collection.  Thank you Amazon.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|A visually moving, heart warming story that shows an unusual, nontraditional family that has all the elements of a \\"real\\" family. Great acting, great photography, and what's not to like about Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman? Even though it is a long movie, it did not seem that way while watching it.

B001TOD92C|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's much hyped but severely uneven career has finally generated a truly first-rate film in \\"The Wrestler.\\" Much of \\"The Wrestler\\" breaks with his oeuvre: while Aronofsky's earlier films were hyper-stylized, frantically edited works with fragmented narratives, \\"The Wrestler\\" is shot in a no frills manner and tells a fairly simple story. Yet in many ways, \\"The Wrestler\\" is the spiritual follow up to \\"Requiem For A Dream.\\"(which I loathed, by the way) It's fundamentally about a man who can't leave behind the addiction that prevents him from living a normal life, and that will surely kill him sooner or later. \\"The Wrestler,\\" however, isn't the preachy, manipulative tale that \\"Requiem\\" was, but instead gives us a character who lives a life that few of us can understand, but whose peculiar, self-destructive desires we can sympathize with to some degree. The tale of the past-his-prime star clinging to the old days is a common story told many times before (though it is perhaps out of fashion of late) but Aronofsky and company have reconstructed compellingly, and brought it into a new age.<br /><br />\\"The Wrestler\\" is wholly focused on Mickey Rourke's Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a washed-up pro wrestler who lives a simple, isolated life and still works the small-time circuit decades after his prime. Randy, nevertheless, seems quite content, until he collapses after a performance, and wakes to discover that he can wrestle no more, lest he risk a fatal heart attack. The film is then a character study, as we follow Randy's day-to-day struggles to develop a new life outside the ring, to reconcile his past and to resist the urge to return, no matter the risks.<br /><br />While it's always wise to consider critical darlings, umm, critically, Rourke is worthy of the hype. His performance is the opposite most critical favorites: it's a controlled, nuanced turn that is almost entirely devoid of the histrionic ACTING!!! that foolish critics adore. Equally significant, Randy is an anomaly in American film: he is a lower class white character who is portrayed with realism and sympathy. Both filmmakers and film critics tend not to have much sympathy for the working class/rednecks/white trash, and to the extent that lower class whites are portrayed positively, it is generally in how they transcend their background. (i.e. they lack the roughness and prejudice of their peers, and would've been middle class types, if circumstances differed.) Randy, however, is thoroughly white trash, and represents a different kind of intellectual divide: he is basically friendly and good-natured, but lacks judgment and self-control. He wants to get his life on track, to hold down a conventional job and to reconnect with his daughter, but he's so ill-controlled and has lived a bizarre life for so long that he knows little else. Moreover, his strange life has left him isolated. He has friendly professional acquaintances, but they're ultimately oddballs like him who live for the ring and little else.<br /><br />Two women, a stripper named \\"Cassidy/Pam\\" (Marisa Tomei) and Randy's estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) play the only other significant roles. (And Wood only has a few scenes.) Tomei is Randy's female counterpart and confidant, a stripper in her mid-40s who will also need to leave her life behind before too much longer. (Tomei, by the way, is so well preserved at 44 that she belongs in a museum or sideshow (\\"Gaaaazze upon the incredible woman in her mid-40s who is STILL HOT!!\\") rather than a strip club.) Wood is merely a snapshot from Randy's past: she initially loathes Randy, though we don't entirely know why, before softening somewhat. With her we learn that Randy hasn't just hurt himself, though the precise details and reasons are never revealed. Though the film is obsessed with the past, it is firmly rooted in the present, and we see only the end results, not the causes. Nevertheless, the scenes between Randy and Stephanie are often sad and touching, as Randy tries to reconnect in his clumsy but sincere way.<br /><br />The ending will no doubt be a source of controversy for some. Some have accused it of being clich&eacute;d and obvious, but with this story there are only a few options, with each of them being somewhat obvious. On a personal level, there are perhaps other endings I would've preferred and that may have been more plausible, but this one fits adequately and plausibly enough. It also avoids the excess sentimentality that easily could've marred the material as written.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Wrestler\\" is easily amongst the best films of a rather subpar year. Check it out.<br /><br />Grade: A-andy tries to reconnect in his clumsy but sincere way.    The ending will no doubt be a source of controversy for some.

B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I love the music of Battlestar Galactica, which captures the complex, multifaceted nature of the series itself.  This CD shows off the versatility of the composer, as everything from Middle East-themed pieces, taiko drumming, and orchestral and operatic themes are included.  The versatility of the music perfectly matches the complex themes and emotions explored by the series.  For example, the beautiful Passacaglia (one of my favorites on the CD) manages to both embody and elevate the complex human drama running through the opening montage of the season's finale.  I cannot imagine the scene without the music, nor the music without the scene.<br /><br />The Battlestar Galactica series set out to dramatically re-imagine not only the original series but the entire science fiction genre.  The music of the series is a large part of its success, and I highly recommend this CD to people looking to relive the magic of the series.
0140277447|5.0|As a 17 year old I stood in the middle of Dachau and wept. I have never heard, read or imagined anything like the Japanese attack on Nanking. Such unbridled inhumanity and brutality is without parallel. The Nazi minister to Nanking wrote to Hitler advising him of the slaughter and did as much as anyone to create a safe zone where many of the Chinese were protected. This should be added to any and all course study of WWII at both the high school and college levels. WARNING...this will give you nightmares!
6305922756|5.0|I've been a fan of Spinal Tap since they went under the name of The (New) Originals. After the tragic gardening death of their first drummer, John \\"Stumpy\\" Pepys, Tap tapped Eric \\"Stumpy Joe\\" Childs to fill the fills and thus began their journey of reputation as England's loudest band. I remember when they opened for Deep Purple in 1972, Ritchie Blackmore, watching backstage, was so intimidated by them that he locked himself in a bathroom for the rest of the night and his band had to soldier on playing a two hour show without him. Spinal Tap were kicked off the bill after one gig.     While I thought Brainhammer and Nerve Damage provided Spinal Tap adequate \\"practice\\" to become a full-fledged heavy metal outfit, they really came into their own with the release of Blood To Let. I remember my buddy bringing his new Master Of Reality LP over to my house one day and I laughed at Sabbath's feeble attempt at heaviness. I took his silly record off the turntable, broke it in half, plunked Blood To Let down in it's place and watched as his head exploded all over my mom's new sofa after hearing the first two chords of the title track. It was a glorious time to be a Tapper.    Unfortunately, tragedy again struck the band two years later when Stumpy Joe died by choking on his own vomit. Worst of all was the release of the lightweight Intravenus de Milo. THIS was their follow-up to the heaviest record of all time (at the time)?! Their pretentious nonsense kicked up a few more notches with the release of The Gospel According To Spinal Tap, which is still cited as one of the worst mistakes a rock band has ever made. I was officially over this band by 1975.    Years later, in '82, I saw Judas Priest on tour and Spinal Tap happened to be opening for them. The band that once blew Deep Purple off the stage was now greeted with boos and jeers from a hostile crowd growing more impatient by the second for their Metal Gods to come out and show them how it's really done. Then, something amazing happened. Spinal Tap started playing a song. Only this time, it wasn't weak. It was actually pretty good. No, it was GREAT! The song they played was the first single off their new LP Smell The Glove entitled \\"Hell Hole.\\" This song was so awesome that the crowd's cheers drowned the amps out before the second chorus. Spinal Tap played for another 45 minutes or so, but I couldn't even tell what the other songs were because of all the crowd noise. It was Beatlemania all over again. The next day, the Hell Hole single had pushed 427 units. Wow.    But it still wasn't enough for Spinal Tap. Little did we the audience know, filmmaker Marty DiBergi had filmed the whole performance as part of his documentary on the band. Two years later, \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" was released and the band's new album shot to #58 on the Billboard Chart. Spinal Tap were finally back. They'd earned their spot as the 58th most popular heavy metal band that week.     Watching this film taught me the secret of being sort of successful. When I got home from my first screening, I immediately wrote the number eleven on my amp and I could HEAR myself actually playing LOUDER!! Nobody else could, but that's because they're stupid. It's such a fine line between clever and stupid, as a wise sage once said.

0143038419|1.0|I had heard about this book from a number of sources, who raved about how fabulous it was, and how enlightening, and courageous. But I was also aware that the premise of the book was that it was one woman's memoir about her divorce and subsequent spiritual journey. ugh. not my cup of tea. But a very good friend recently told me that she too had heard good things about it... so I took the plunge.  What did I find? I finished it a few days ago, and the more I dwell on the book, the less satisfying it is. True, she is a good writer, and knows how to turn a phrase... but at what cost?  The book begins with her finding herself in a crippling depression, in spite of having what most of us would call a 'good life'. A good marriage, a successful career, an apartment in Manhatten, a house in the suburbs, good friends, etc. But she doesn't want any of it, she comes to realize. It's the story of her mid-life crisis. And because she is a woman and can write so poetically about her liberation from such a narrow and pedestrian life (as opposed to the more sleezy male derived 'red ferrari and a younger woman' version), we congratulate her. We say 'good for you! you deserve it! you are the master of your own destiny! take only the best! at whatever cost to those around you!' And indeed, she does.  She destroys her marriage and a bitter divorce ensues. Upon leaving her husband, she immediately takes up with a younger man. That ends badly, sending her spiralling into yet another depression (suprise, surprise... funny how emotionally abusing yourself and others will do that to a person), and then determines that the only thing to do is travel to first Italy, then India, then Indonesia on a quest of fulfillment and self-discovery. It is a tale perhaps more appropriately titled \\"Gluttony, Naval-gazing, Fornicating.\\" I know, I know.. how puritan of me.  She has absolutely no notion of self-sacrifice, living for the other, dying to self. At least not that this book indicated. The messagepreached here is fulfill yourself, and indulge all your whims and desires and see what comes. It seems to have worked for her. I mean, look at her now! A hugely successful book-soon-to-be-movie (starring julia roberts! I'm not kidding you!), book tours, interviews with Oprah, a glamorous transcontinental life, a new sexy Brazilian husband. Obviously the universe is conspiring for her happiness. It's just lucky that she was brave enough to reach out and grab it. The rest of us who are not so brave will just never know, I guess.
0385474547|5.0|I first read this book in college over 15 years ago, and it's still as fresh and relevant today as it was then.     This book is smart and thinky with a wonderful sense of irony and humanity that crosses cultural boundaries to illustrate its points in a sharp way without ever feeling overly didactic.    Highly recommended.
0312360266|4.0|I picked this book up at JFK airport as I was 3 hours early for a flight. I haven't been interested in the Twilight series, but I do watch True Blood on HBO so this book very much intrigued me. I was bored at first by the teenage angst problems (boyfriends...parents...immature best friends); however, I became entranced by the story once the story showed the bond of the main character and her grandma.<br /><br />A delight to read about loyalty and self awareness. The main character reminds me a lot of who I was as a teen (without the whole vampire bit). Really, the underlying themes here are more about being true to yourself and the people that you love.

0142001104|5.0|I'm not sure I would have picked up The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life by Rosamund Stone Zandar and Benjamin Zander without some external motivation.  That happened when I had the opportunity to see Benjamin Zander present the material at a conference I attended.  Within 30 seconds I was mesmerized, and my mindset changed forever.  Reading The Art of Possibility was like reliving the presentation again, and it helped to reinforce all the incredible information I learned.<br /><br />Contents:<br />An Invitation to Possibility; Launching the Journey<br />The Practices: It's All Invented; Stepping into a Universe of Possibility; Giving an A; Being a Contribution; Leading from Any Chair; Rule Number 6; The Way Things Are; Giving Way to Passion; Lighting a Spark; Being the Board; Creating Frameworks for Possibility; Telling the WE Story<br />Coda; Acknowledgments; A Guide to the Stories; About the Authors<br /><br />Benjamin Zander is a renowned conductor, and his experiences in that field frame many of the stories and lessons in the book.  For instance, Giving An A comes from his philosophy in teaching musicians.  The competition amongst his students is intense, and anxiety over grades only contribute to less-than-perfect learning.  To remove that barrier, he starts out the class by giving everyone an A. The only thing they need to do is write a letter, dated six months in the future, describing what they did to get an A in the course.  That simple act changes the mindset of the students from competition to possibilities.  Instead of competing with others, they are working towards fulfilling their possibilities.  Another one I benefit from daily is Rule #6, which is \\"don't take yourself so ********* seriously.\\"  It's natural for the calculating self to be on guard for any indications that their importance is being diminished. That locks you into situations where you don't think anything can change.  Instead, you can set aside the calculating self and let the central self shine through.  Rule #6 allows you to let the internal calculating self lighten up, thereby releasing the pressure and \\"importance\\" of the moment.  Then you can explore options that may not have been present so long as you're trying to remain \\"important\\".<br /><br />I would have gotten a lot from this book had I not seen Zander live.

B001TH16DI|4.0|We should know by now that when studios release movies either stand alone or in packs for the first time that they will be the \\"original\\" versions.  I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews for this set. I for one am glad they are doing this in this case because the theatrical vesion of STMP might never be released again.  I like the enhancements to STMP - The Director's Cut, but I didn't like that they took the computer voice out of it!  That's how a starship should be run, motly by computer!  Also, the theatrical version is the one I waited for as a kid and was so amazed by when I saw it.  When they are released, I will get the \\"enhanced\\" vesions of the first four movies since they are the ones that I care most about. 5 I could care less about and 6, while pretty good, I wouldn't watch the extras if they were included.

044024367X|2.0|Anyone who's read one of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels knows what to expect: Jack Reacher, drifter and almost anti-hero, who has rejected just about everything related to normal life and wanders from place to place seemingly aimlessly but usually with a logic that makes sense only to him, stumbling upon some problem or injustice or just something that intrigues him... and we're into another twisty, edge-of-the-seat thriller. For the most part, I've found the Reacher novels entertaining enough to get me over my usual dislike of macho heroes and action thrillers.    Not so with this book. For the first time, the plot is slow and meandering, just like Reacher's seventeen-mile walks from Hope to Despair. I think, honestly, readers travelled that change of emotions with him, gradually coming to despair of any decent story coming out of these 500+-pages of dreariness. For the first time, the edge-of-the-seat tension is missing. I kept waiting for the twists, the shock revelations, the 'why didn't I see that coming'... but it simply wasn't there. Just yet more backwards and forwards journeys to Despair - a town that did not want Reacher around - and endless watching empty roads for hours on end. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz    Even the revelations, when they finally came, were unconvincing. If the owner of Despair's factory is so all-controlling, how could anyone be using the place as a dispatch centre for deserters? And even thirty seconds' Googling would have told Child that Canada does NOT offer asylum to US military deserters. Second, the factory being used as a processing centre for plutonium, and the alleged plot with the plutonium, sounded very far-fetched; the motivation was unconvincing and with such thin evidence offered in support left me shaking my head in disbelief.    Finally, while I'm getting used to Reacher picking up, using and then discarding convenient women in these books, his patronising and controlling behaviour in this particular instalment was close to offensive. What right does he have to tell Vaughan - whose first name we don't even learn - how she should feel about sleeping with him?    I hope the next instalment in the Reacher series is better, otherwise this may be the end of the road for me and Jack Reacher will be permanently consigned to Despair.
B000J10EQU|4.0|Superman Returns(2006) is a disappointing  superman movie with beautiful cinematography and great special effects and john Williams awesome superman music. The story is about Superman leaving the earth for 5 years to explore the asteroid grave yard of his home planet krypton. Then returning to earth to find out Lois Lane has left him and moved on with her life and Lex Luthor his old enemy is planning another real estate world domination scheme by stealing crystals from the fortress of solitude that gives him the power of advanced alien technology to create land masses and submerge other continents. Superman should have left the earth to absorb the yellow rays of the Sun so he can increase his powers to fly around the earth  a million times faster than the speed of light and to fight evil super villains like darkseid or doomsday. Also he absorbs so much power from the yellow Sun that he is immune to the radiation from kryptonite which is his only weakness and which is deadly to him and could kill him. Even though he is an all powerful, human looking, alien demi-god that is immortal and can`t really die. Superman`s Amazing Powers and Abilities are like that of angels or fallen angels. The scene where Superman lifts that kryptonite laced continent out of the ocean and pushes it into space and then falls back to earth with out stretched arms and the airplane sequence are spectacular ! Superman Returns is a boring superman movie with some epic, great scenes and inspirational lines like when Superman says to Lois Lane,&#34;You say the world doesn`t need a Savior, but every day I keep hearing them cry out for one&#34; and when Lex luthor says &#34;Gods are selfish being that fly around in red capes and don`t share their Power with mankind&#34;!

B00005JY1O|5.0|There are very few albums ever recorded where i can say every single song on them could be turned, not into a hit single maybe, but they all are songs you want to listen to; in the age of iTunes we all buy songs individually, picking off of the album what we think are the best fruits; this is an album for the argument to collect albums rather than singles. This is an absolutely classic Dylan album; it is absolutely not definitive, however you'll need at least 8 studio albums if you want to even scratch the surface of Dylan's definitive records. If you like music, and poetry or one or the other, it doesn't matter, just get this album and prepare to be taken on a completely unique journey to what has happened to you before. This is THE sound; the one everyone craves like heroin, and the one that influenced a million artists.

B000H5TVKI|3.0|I remembered how much I liked this movie as a kid, and at $10 I gave it a shot. The premise of the movie is still great, crooked cops mess with the wrong Green Beret, but man, is it cheesy by today's standards.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It has been three years since I've seen this movie the first time. I didn't see this movie in a theater, and bought it instantly when it was released on DVD. The day the movie came out I quickly went and bought it. I put it in the machine rather quickly and hoped for a movie that was going to leave some sort of impact on me because of all the hype surrounding its release.    The first time I watched this movie I was letdown. I thought this movie was slow and dull, and obviously letdown because of all the hype. However, I recently decided to watch it again--three years later--and I don't know why I had the reaction I did the first time. This movie is honestly beautiful!     I think the first time I watched this movie there was too much hype surrounding it so I got bored instantly thinking there would be more to the movie. There's nothing more that could be wanted though, and I know that now. This truly is a great story.    The acting is brilliant from everyone in this film! I think the first time I watched this movie I should have turned the volume up because Heath Leger's character mumbles a bit--he's a man of few words. I think because I didn't catch everything he said the first time I really missed much of this movie. It's a story about love. A story about how you should always be true to yourself and the one you love. It sounds simple, but it's far from simple, and this movie proves that.     There will always be some people that refer to this as the \\"gay cowboy movie\\" but it's not. True, the characters are cowboys, but gay people are like everyone else, and they are everywhere and every type of person. Some people have a problem with this movie because it deals with homosexuality, but they have their own issues and miss the point of this movie entirely.    I was letdown the first time I watched this movie, and there are reasons for it, but I'm not letdown now. The only thing that lets me down is I wasn't able to enjoy this completely the first time, and I've only seen the movie twice in three years, but I'm sure I'll be watching it constantly from now on.     This movie is beautiful and tragic. It's a great story, and it'll stand the test of time. If you've not seen it, or you were letdown when you saw it, I urge you to see this movie either for the first time or again!

B001K3JF7K|5.0|In this CD Diana Krall once again proves she can take any song and make it her own. The manner in which she vocalizes is sensuous and seductive. She sings softly and sultry luring the listener into gentle musical vignettes - a romantic voyage.
0517548232|5.0|This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics.  All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills.  Peter Schiff's \\"Crashproof\\" would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson.  And for the more serious student of Austrian economics, especially in these times, you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit, and Rothbard's The Great Depression.
B000EBCEBI|5.0|I bought the Avenged Sevenfold cd and I liked it so much that I got this one too. I've become an A7X junkie. The vocals aren't as smooth as the Avenged Sevenfold album. They definately came a long way in two years. Their sound is crisp and clean on the A7X album, whereas it is a little more muddled on City Of Evil. But, Bat Country definately sounds more like '07 Avenged and it was the first song I ever heard by them. I appreciate the way they blend harmonizing with classical instruments and heavy metal guitar rifts. But if you're not a hard core A7X fan...I would recommend hearing the smooth stuff first.
B001PA0FFO|3.0|Some reviewers referred to Doubt as a film for big-lobed geniuses. Others called it garbage.        Doubt falls somewhere in the middle. This film is not garbage - its designed and was released to get Academy Awards; and like a machine well-designed for a purpose, it does its job. Doubt pushes all the right emotional buttons, has all the right actors and actresses and the story is heavy enough to get the Academy's attention. Plus it contrasts nicely with the Holocaust-related films that are usually a shoe-in at the Oscars.        Even though this film is Oscar bait, Doubt is not bad. I liked the performances in the film and it is not boring. Sure, there are no car crashes nor explosions, but Doubt can still be considered a decent rental, if not a sale purchase.        To the \\"garbage\\" reviewers: I recommend \\"The Man From Earth\\" - a \\"thinking person's\\" movie, but it is not Oscar-bait and it is very entertaining.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Very loosely based upon a short story by the great American author F. Scott Fitzgerald, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a beautiful movie that is both personal in focus, but epic in scope. Set mostly in New Orleans, the film follows the life of a baby boy whose mother dies during his birth on Armistice Day, the end of WWI, November 11, 1918. The baby is so deformed that his father considers killing the child by dropping him in the river, but is stopped by a policeman. Startled the father runs through some streets and down and alley and leaves the baby on the steps of the first reasonable house he comes to. It turns out that the &#34;house&#34; is actually a retirement home for the elderly and the baby is found by the chief caretaker of the place, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). Queenie is unable to have children of her own and decides to adopt the child because even if it does look like a devil, it is one of God's children, too. She names the baby Benjamin and in time he begins to grow. As time goes on it appears that instead of growing older Benjamin is growing younger. Such a curious case that Benjamin Button.<br /><br />THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON features some extraordinary acting. Brad Pitt gained most of the attention for his performance as Benjamin, but Pitt's performance is really overrated. I'm not saying he doesn't do a good job, but Pitt actually doesn't show up as Benjamin until about a third of the way through the movie. The reason Benjamin Button is so memorable as a character isn't because of Pitt's acting ability, but because of the makeup and special effects. The real star performers in the film are Cate Blanchett as Daisy and Taraji P. Henson as Queenie. Blanchett is one of the best actresses of the age and Henson proves that she is a rising star.<br /><br />The visual effects, set design, costumes, cinematography, and editing are all notable. In addition, the film has a wonderful score that augments the story that is told. This is the rare movie where all the elements of the movie come together seamlessly as they help create the realistic and authentic world from the past in this fictional tale.<br /><br />Like most great works of art, there are a several meanings you can take away from THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON. There are some who feel the movie is about death and how one goes about facing death. There is an underlying tone of sadness that pervades the picture. However, this sadness is underlying and isn't always prominent. I believe that instead of death and dying, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is, instead, about living. It is true that many characters in the movie die or are in various stages of death throughout the movie. But as Benjamin tells the audience from his own journal, death is just a part of life. All of us have to die, but it is up to us to choose whether to live or just exist and if we chose to live it is also our choice of how we will live. Death, disease, war, accidents, and lost love are all a part of life, but despite the sadness and sorrow life truly is beautiful and the world is full of wonder if we only choose to see it.<br /><br />It should be noted that there are two versions of THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON available on DVD. If you are looking for just the movie with no frills, you'll want to purchase the single disc version. However, if you're a bit of a cinemaphile or are a huge fan of the film, you'll probably want to check out the special two-disc version that has a ton of special features, including interviews, featurettes, and special coverage from the film's premiere.are movie where all the elements of the movie come together seamlessly as they help create the realistic and authentic world from the past in this fictional tale.<br /><br />Like most great works of art, there are a several meanings you can take away from THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON.

B00009P1O5|4.0|Looking back at Neil's RE-AC-TOR, one wonders how it is not a more highly regarded release in the hard rock genre. Pehapa it was just the timing, after all, in 1981 REO Speedwagon, Journey, Billy Squire, The Police and AC/DC were selling out arenas all over the world.<br /><br />Reactor is a strong if misunderstood collection. When one remembers the advertised materials that were in Circus and Cream magazine at the time of release, there was a theme for the album. I clearly remember a hazardous materials placard that was split up into sections, each section was a different mode of transportation; one was a limo, one was a train, i cant remember the others, there might have been a surfer. When going over the song titles and themes, there is a direct reference to different modes of transportation. Southern Pacific and Rapid Transit address trains, Motorcity references cars, Getting back on it is about hitch hiking, Surfer Joe is obviously surfing. It is also ironic that Neil decided to call his next album TRANS, which also featured cars on the cover. I know that he loves cars, but is he also fasinated with transportation itself. The title is also a play on a nuclear reactor, and also the way one reacts, surely the cover is meant to resemble a nuclear placard.<br /><br />T-Bone is a sarcastic jibe in only the way he can address it, just keep repeating that the economy stinks, without directly saying it.<br /><br />Opera Star is also refered to as &quot;Born To Rock&quot; as he introduced it during his 1986 Rusted Out Garage tour.<br /><br />Strangely, critics were quick to dismiss this album, only noting that SHOTS was the only good song on the record, as time passes, the album gets stronger. Perhaps they were waiting for another HARVEST or AFTER THE GOLD RUSH.<br /><br />Check out my other reviews... Danny
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I should start by saying that having watched all five seasons, Stargate Atlantis is officially my second favorite science fiction show (the first being Firefly).<br /><br />The first season starts out a bit uncertainly, but by the middle of the season I was fully engaged in the show and its characters.  Interestingly enough, when I went back later and re-watched the beginning of the series, I loved it!  The bottom line is - if it doesn't hook you at first, keep watching.<br /><br />Atlantis is not the best written show I've ever encountered, but its characters are among the most endearing.  The acting is excellent as are the special effects, so I'm willing to forgive the choppy writing.  The flaws it suffers from are common ones: uneven character development, characters magically regenerating from devastating traumas and injuries within the space of a week, characters forced out of character for the sake of a story, and so forth.<br /><br />But putting all of that aside, I truly did fall in love with this show and its characters, who became like a dysfunctional second family.  Some of the highlights:<br /><br />John Sheppard - team leader and military commander of Atlantis. Highly trained, highly intelligent, snarky, brave, loyal and protective of his team above all else, Sheppard is a semi-suicidal hero with a dark past and disdain for authority. Sheppard's character bio might sound trite, but he is played with such delightful, playful expressiveness and complexity by Joe Flanigan that he becomes much more.  The beautifully acted Sheppard is an endearing, flawed, and lovable leader.<br /><br />Dr. Elizabeth Wier - overall expedition leader, in charge of Atlantis Base.  Wier initially seems stiff and reserved, but develops into a smart and likable administrator who even has a positive relationship with the normally defiant Sheppard.  A civilian, Wier lends the expedition a scientific and humanitarian aspect.<br /><br />Dr. Rodney McKay - brilliant physicist and overall tech/science/mechanical genius who is in charge of saving the day whenever Sheppard isn't doing so.  Initially portrayed as a bit of a coward, the insecure, high-strung, arrogant, and self-centered McKay is the show's best layered and developed character.  McKay shows great courage and loyalty in overcoming his fears, and becomes a valuable, endearing member of Sheppard's team.  Despite his arrogance and biting put-downs of co-workers, McKay is also portrayed as one of the most caring and moral people in the expedition.<br /><br />Dr. Carson Beckett - A highly skilled Scottish medical doctor, Carson is in charge of all things medical and also becomes a more and more integral part of Sheppard's team.  Carson is a deeply compassionate, sweet, and caring person that one cannot help but fall in love with, while an inner strength and occasionally biting retorts keep him from being a cream puff in doctor form.  Carson is one of my favorite characters - ever.<br /><br />Lieutenant Aiden Ford - initially a team member, Ford's character never quite developed, and was eventually dropped from the show.<br /><br />Teyla Emmagan - Probably the most cardboard character of the team, Teyla none the less has some great scenes and contributes to the dynamics of the show.  The hot female leader of an alien race of people, she decides that the best bet for her people's future is to leave them and join the Atlantis expedition.  If John Sheppard is the designated eye candy for us female viewers, Teyla is the scantily clad warrior chick for the males.<br /><br />The Wraith - anorexic goth vampires, AKA the Bad Guys.  These nearly indestructible evildoers farm humans like cattle and feed on them by draining their life force in an excruciatingly painful feeding process.  Fond of vengeance and growling noises, the wraith are the number one enemy of the expedition and of the galaxy as a whole.  The wraith would love to find out where earth is so they can snack on it.<br /><br />The Lost City of Atlantis - a submerged/floating/flying city filled with endless undiscovered technology.<br /><br />Along with a well-rounded cast of likable side characters, this team along with some later changes keeps us well entertained for five seasons, at the end of which the show was canceled for no particularly good reason.<br /><br />I grew to love Atlantis, and I hope you'll give yourself a chance to fall in love with it too!technology.    Along with a well-rounded cast of likable side characters, this team along with some later changes keeps us well entertained for five seasons, at the end of which the show was canceled for no particularly good reason.    I grew to love Atlantis, and I hope you'll give yourself a chance to fall in love with it too!

B001TOD92C|5.0|I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was. Perhaps I was afraid that it would be all about wrestling. To be sure, the fight scenes are unpleasant to watch; although they are choreographed by the wrestlers themselves, they are still graphic, and the men suffer real pain, blood loss, and other injuries in the ring.    But that isn't the focus of the film.  Its focus is on one man, the Ram, who has spent 20 years taking body slams and injuring himself to please the crowd.  Now he's on painkillers, going deaf, having heart trouble, and regretting the years he spent estranged from his rightfully angry daughter.  He's also got a friend, an exotic dancer who has a kind soul and who dreams of a better life for her son.  And he sees how wrestlers end up:  broke, living on disability, in wheelchairs, collecting a few dollars for an autograph or a photo op.  Mickey Rourke looks suitably broken down as the Ram, while Marisa Tomei shines as the dancer, and Evan Rachel Wood emotes as the frightfully pale teen daughter.  Despite what a few others have said here, this film certainly has an ending:  the Ram's heart is under terrible strain as he goes into the ring for one last fight. That's the way he chooses to go out, and you don't need to be shown explicitly how it will turn out.  Anyone who pays attention will know where things are headed.     Recommended viewing.
B000002HMH|5.0|The lead singers of metal's two heaviest bands, Pantera and Slayer, trashed this album big-time.  Pantera's Phil Anselmo laughed on stage at a Dallas Pantera show about how much he thought the album sucked, and Slayer's Tom Araya said Metallica was breaking their fans hearts with this album that he labeled as a complete band sellout.  Keep in mind these are the singers of two bands that only barely changed their sound over the years and didn't show much musical growth.    The biggest complaint about \\"Load\\" was that it was Metallica giving in to the grunge era and becoming a grunge band, themselves.  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  Dokken and their few open-minded fans had to deal with the same widespread complaint about Dokken's extremely underrated and diverse album \\"Shadowlife\\" that was released in 1997.  Just because these two bands came out with a new sound in the middle of the grunge phenomenon doesn't mean they were making grunge, themselves.  With that said, \\"Load\\" is insane, scary, loud, powerful, addictive, and a huge kick in the ass of previous Metallica thrash found on albums such as \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\".  Those older albums were very original and broke open the world of metal in a huge way, but the songs were empty of soul and based on just technical brilliance.  James Hetfield must have walked into the studio as a man possessed when Metallica recorded \\"Load\\".  His vocals and guitar riffs on this album came from a power source that could be equated with inner hellfire.  There's not a dud on this album.  It's a complete improvement and upward abandonment from their previous \\"Black Album\\".  \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" is a great opener for \\"Load\\" with an instant kick from all four members' instruments right when it starts that doesn't let up.  \\"King Nothing\\" lifts the driving riff of \\"Enter Sandman\\" into new heights, and the song's guitar power is matched wonderfully by Lars' equally heart-pounding drums.  Hetfield's vocals on this track are downright threatening in their warning and sarcasm towards a worthless power figure. Hetfield is even more threatening with sarcasm in \\"Poor Twisted Me\\", mocking some whiner who he's fed up with, just like the \\"king\\" in \\"King Nothing\\"... there comes a point in the song where things get so chaotic instrumentally and vocally that you just hear Hetfield screeching in a muffled, noisy musical environment at whoever this target of his attack is, and you pray that James never gets sick of you.  The album's two singles (which can both be found on karaoke lists everywhere), \\"Hero of the Day\\" and \\"Until it Sleeps\\", should have THRILLED Metallica fans with the fact that this band can combine sheer metal with pure songwriting.  Too many fans reacted to these songs with distaste, simply because they are actual SONGS... but how can one complain when you get to bang your head and sing along at the same time?  I personally think these two singles proved the band DIDN'T sell out, because both tracks are still both just as heavy as anything the band had written before this.  The album's two long masterpieces, \\"Bleeding Me\\" and \\"The Outlaw Torn\\", demand the attention of entire cities, whether their inhabitants like metal or not. One time I cranked the chorus of \\"Bleeding Me\\" out of my car while driving, and a girl walking down the road, who must have been a fan, almost collapsed in shock and excitement at what she was hearing.  The bridge at the end of the song lends itself to fist-pumping more than any other rock song I've ever heard.  Hetfield's voice oscillates on these two songs from quiet and beautiful to loud and articulate.  When his booming voice articulates, it resembles a carpenter slowly, but mightily hammering a giant nail into a giant coffin with a giant hammer.  It is a wonderful thing, and his eventual wolf-like howling at the end of both songs begs for a rewriting of the term \\"climax\\".  I'm more than acquainted with Metallica's catalog released before this album, and I've seen enough of their live footage to know that their studio work on this album is far and away their greatest achievement. I wouldn't call it an experimental album like \\"And Justice For All\\" was, and I simply label it as a fantastic heavy metal album that contains actual song composition.  They'd always been innovative and heavy, but those two traits shouldn't have left metal fans not craving something like \\"Load\\".
034544678X|5.0|I learned so much from this book.  I'm the kind of person that needs to know WHY I should do something - don't just tell me to do it, explain  to me WHY.  McConnell does  a great job of explaining why in an easy to understand, but never dumbed down, manner.  I know this is the kind of book I will go back to again and again as I learn more about my dogs.  I would highly recommend this to anyone you works with dogs - even if the work is only at home!
B00000GAMF|5.0|I have since changed that opinion.  Like many of the other reviewers here, I was not impressed with this album upon first listen because there isn't that big bang song which instantly catches your attention.  So if you are doing anything else except listening to this album, you will pass right over most of these songs.  You need to be firmly seated with all attention on this album to fully appreciate it.  However, attentive listening is rewarded with a rich tapestry of song and story.  It tells the story of the complete neurosis of modern living (Living the Big Lie) and how we are just supposed, \\"to get used to it.\\"  This starts the tale of an abused runaway (Runaway), who is dragged back to her abusers as she it told to just \\"get used to it.\\"  This is not a happy album and it is not particularly musical in places, but that is the best part of this album.  To me, it seems as though it was not written as music, it was written to tell a story which just happens to be told through song rather than paint, film, or some other media.  Everything about this album, the raging guitar, the slow piano, the near a cappella passages, was done to tell the story and what a story it has to tell - this, more than anything, is why this is a 5 star album.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|If you liked Portishead's previous efforts, you're sure to enjoy this album.  It's every bit as dark and tragic as anything they've ever done, yet it's somehow different.  I couldn't put my finger on it, but it does sound like they've updated their sound a bit to give it even more texture.    Great mood music as always, but the lyrics are also intense.  Recommended.

I started to buy comic books and read them, honestly, I loved them somehow, but not like a real reading, it was just time killing.<br /><br />When I heard of Watchmen, I bought the book when I saw it in Kuala Lumpur in 2004, and starting reading it in 2006.<br /><br />This book breaks all the rules . . so complicated for a comic book, no woner why it ranked high in amazon or best 100 novels.<br /><br />For me, this is the best Graphic novel I have ever read. So recommended, even if you're not a comics fan.

0061134007|4.0|I was a bit skeptical when this was touted for being awarded the \\"Best Norwegian Crime Novel Ever Written\\", as Norway has about the same population as the state of Alabama.  But despite having never considered myself being a \\"WWII history buff\\", I've read a string of good thrillers set in the period lately - so was attracted to this one, based on the reviews.  Here's the upsides and downsides I found in this one:<br /><br />DOWNSIDES:<br />- Not quite the page-turner I expected from other reviewers - until I got to the second half.<br /><br />- A lot of extra side characters and switching between past and present made the storyline a bit confusing, and limits it from being quite the page-turner that it could be.<br /><br />- Despite a decent ending, one important plot line regarding a murderer never really gets wrapped up.<br /><br />UPSIDES (and in general these outweigh the Downsides):<br />- What raises this above the typical mystery thriller is the fascinating look at Norwegians which fought WWII alongside Germany, and their subsequent reaction to the international condemnation of those who supported Hitler. This book shines in it's ability to bring that dilemma to life through it's characters!<br /><br />- The key characters are well-developed, and it's a particularly interesting and insightful look at Norwegians, if you have ever visited or plan to visit Norway.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Somewhere between a 3-star and 4-star rating. A solid effort that's above average for it's genre.  More thought-provoking, but not as exciting for \\"non-WWII history buffs\\" as some others I've read recently, like [[ASIN:0446402397 Child 44]] and [[ASIN:0452295297 City of Thieves: A Novel]].

B001RTP48G|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys are of course comprised of Neil Tennant (brilliant vocals) and Chris Lowe (equally brilliant keyboards and music).  The reality is that both are incredibly talented musicians, but with the quality of their productions, it takes more than two to tango.  Let me tell you as a very long-time fan that the Pet Shop Boys are really a multi-person band with two consistent members.  And in the case of \\"Yes\\", the very best of the previous band members are back, along with some fresh new faces.<br /><br />First, let me specifically mention another incredibly gifted programmer / engineer / producer / DJ by the name of Pete Gleadall.  His work with the Boys is outstanding - you will hear his influence within their music since the early 90's.  His involvement isn't always obvious, but he can take a great song and make it spine-tingling.  And his work on this album is quite evident, and pays off big-time.  The other artists who worked with the Boys on this album are also outstanding in their own right.<br /><br />But on to the songs ... I'll start with Disk 1, which is what everyone gets when they buy any version of the album.<br /><br />Disk 1<br /><br />1. Love Etc - This is a catchy song and an appropriate first single on the disk.  A nice beat, haunting melody and chord progressions, yet somehow bright and grand - a classic that any PSB-tuned ears will love.<br /><br />2. All Over The World - At first listen I hated this one.  The classic music sampling and chanting opening chorus had me pressing the \\"next\\" button in a hurry.  But of course (as has happened with many PSB songs for me), after a few listens I came to appreciate this track as something a little different, and brilliant in its own way.  It is somehow inspirational in a \\"worldly\\" manner - I can see this being a track in a movie that shows slaves uprising, children being fed, and people helping one another.  I'm absolutely not saying that is the point of the song - I'll leave that analysis for much more brilliant minds than mine - but I will say this song will also become a beloved track for you.<br /><br />3. Beautiful People - OK - not all the tracks on this CD are fantastic, even after a few listens.  This one isn't bad, but sounds too much like it is from a cowboy movie, as strange as that sounds.  This is definitely a more musically \\"experimental\\" track - not for me, but I can still appreciate it.<br /><br />4. Did You See Me Coming? - Possibly the best track on the CD.  You will not be able to get this one out of your head.  Nice Johnny Marr guitar, but very light - just perfect.  Completely \\"poppy\\" and catchy - the kind of tune that makes a good summer theme song.<br /><br />5. Vulnerable - Another classic track - sounds like something that could have come from their Release album, but more mature and catchy - a fast beat, nice bass line, excellent programming and musical touches, and lyrically a listening pleasure.  Any PSB fan will love this one.<br /><br />6. More Than A Dream - This one strikes me as the best track that is not a typical PSB sounding production.  The collaborative efforts come into play and once again pay off.  Another great beat, a pop classic, and the type of song that you'll find yourself nodding your head to in a dorky \\"oh yeah\\" fashion, until you realize the person next to you at the stoplight is laughing at you.  This is another song that I cannot stop playing - a bit different, but wonderful.<br /><br />7. Building A Wall - This reminds me a bit of the old Electronic sound - probably due to a bit heavier guitar from Johnny Marr.  There are some chanting parts of the song that don't quite sit well with me, but overall this is a decent track - very easy to listen to, but more of a B-side type.<br /><br />8. King Of Rome - this reminds me a little of their \\"Confidential\\" demo that they did for Tina Turner in the 90s.  Also reminiscent of \\"View From the Balcony\\" - not necessary something that jumps out at you at first listen, butyou grow to appreciate it.  Nice, smooth, relaxing, and beautiful.  Every PSB album seems to having something like this, and is a long-term gem for sure.<br /><br />9. Pandemonium - At first you'll swear you accidentally popped in your old Depeche Mode \\"Reach Out and Touch Faith\\" track.  But after a few bars this turns to another classic PSB anthem.  Quick pacing, very \\"singable\\" for those karaoke heroes.  It is hard to not find a smile creeping on your face when you listen to this song - another brilliant production!<br /><br />10. The Way It Used To Be - Another nice beat, but a bit more subdued than some of the other entries on the CD.  More great chord progressions and vocals that you have come to expect - this type of song is what the listeners crave and why the Boys have such a loyal following.<br /><br />11. Legacy - OK, there is one song that I just completely dislike, and this is the one.  It sounds like a demo from the early 90s, complete with inferior midi orchestra \\"instruments\\".  I love the Boys, and I suppose this is another \\"experiment\\", but for me was an experiment gone awry.  Too bad the album ends on this note, but the rest of it is so incredible, who cares!<br /><br />And on to Disk 2.  This is what you get when you pay the extra few bucks.  Look, the PSBs won't be around forever (although I wish they would) - just splurge, skip that value meal that you don't need, and pick up the special edition while it is still available.  You'll get some extra enjoyment from some remixes that are worthy for the collection. But to be brutally honest, I don't see as much offered on this as the bonus disk from \\"Fundamental\\", so I would not say the extra disk is a \\"must have\\".  Here is the rundown:<br /><br />Disk 2<br /><br />1. This Used To Be The Future - The only song that is not just a remix of a song on Disc 1, this is an interesting track in that this is possibly the most significant set of vocals performed by Chris Lowe to date.  I enjoy the balance between Neil and Chris on this track.  It is something of a \\"B\\" side - as many of the more memorable PSB gems are.  Not my favorite, but I'm glad to have it in the collection.<br /><br />2. More Than A Dream (Magical Dub) - Primarily an instrumental remix with some expected additional musical segments.  Great for background music around the house - sure, not a \\"must own\\" but more like a \\"nice to have\\".<br /><br />3. Pandemonium (The Stars And The Sun Dub) - I had high hopes for this mix since I love the original track so much.  But it falls a bit short in my opinion - it a few \\"robot voice\\" vocals instead of Neil's normal voice - a big mistake in my opinion, but hey, it is danceable and another track that plays fine as background music.<br /><br />4. The Way It Used To Be (Left Of Love Dub) - This one varies enough from the album version that I feel like I truly got another song.  Has some nice vocals from Neil (reduced amount from the album), and some nice instrumental piano to supplement.  A very nice mix, very well engineered.<br /><br />5. All Over The World (This Is A Dub) - More \\"robot\\" voices.  If you like those you'll like this remix.  I don't care for \\"robot\\" voices though - heck I can do that on my home computer, but I certainly will never sound like Neil Tennant.  Let the man sing!  But I will say again - not a bad background music track.<br /><br />6. Vulnerable (Public Eye Dub) - A more classic style remix - vocals are filtered, but it works for this mix.  There are some abrupt variances from the album version that are fun - not a bad track at all - but certainly not an improvement over the original.<br /><br />7. Love Etc. (Beautiful Dub) - This one lives up to the \\"Beautiful Dub\\" name.  Very nice - very smooth - very polished.  Superior to the album version?  Again I say \\"no\\", but close - just a bit different, but this one helped make me feel like me extra dollars spent on the special edition were worth it.<br /><br />In summary - YES - get this album - YES - you will love it.  Thank you PSBs (and others) for this - keep up the great work!'m glad to have it in the collection.    2.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|OK, I've read what everyone else has said about this product.  I was warned by a cab driver who loves foreign films that they dubbed (HORRORS) this film.  What is the matter with people?  Is everyone so lazy that you can't read a subtitle?  And these were subtitles?  To be honest, I could've followed the film without dialog, but this DVD is a travesty.  I agree with everyone else.  I enjoyed Insomnia (on VHS only) and the American remake was laughable.  I just do not understand the mentallity and dumbing down of the filmgoing public.  I learned to appreciate foreign films, letterboxing and subtitles from a 21 year old film buff and I can never thank him enough.    This is a beautiful film that I was not able to see in the theatres.  So I was anxious to get on DVD.  I love vampire stories but do not see them for the gore.  This film was poignant and tugged at the ole heart strings.  I loved every aspect of it.  I fell in love with both Oskar and Eli and would welcome both into my home.  Leave it to the Europeans to make a superior film on an age-old topic.  While I recommend the film, I cannot recommend the DVD.  Wait for the re-release.  I will buy it, only because I loved the story.
B00006JSS8|5.0|If you've never owned a Stevie Wonder album in your life, \\"The Definitive Collection\\" is a good choice, if you only want one disc by this most talented man.  \\"Definitive\\" in this case meaning reliable or representative, this is the case, although people confuse the term with \\"COMPREHENSIVE\\", which would by definition make it complete or at least wide in scope.  It is surely a sturdy, representative collection of which I would think no one could possibly find fault, knowing well ahead of time that it would not be a complete collection by any means. But even if you've owned some Stevie on CD, this is still a worthwhile collection to have, if only for the first-time EVER appearance of the 45 edit of \\"Do I Do\\" on ANY Stevie album, vinyl, tape or CD.  Those wanting more COMPREHENSIVE collections would be advised to check out one of three:  \\"Original Musiquarium I\\" which is a first-rate collection running from 1972 to 1981, and includes the heartfelt \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" among the other hits and new tracks, \\"Song Review\\", which purports to be a career-spanning collection, but still (barely) misses the mark, although it encompasses his hits from the 60s and 80s, as well as some 90s gems, or, if you want the most bang for your buck, \\"At the Close of A Century\\" box set is truly the definitive AND comprehensive collection to have, starting with the full 6-1/2 minute version of the live \\"Fingertips\\", along with 22 other hits and rarities from 1963-1972 (his own version of \\"Until You Come Back to Me\\", Aretha's 1974 hit, is stunning), and doesn't let up until the end of Disc 4 with his duet with Babyface, \\"How Come, How Long\\".  But if you want just one Stevie disc, you can't go wrong here (although my personal faves \\"A Place in the Sun\\" and \\"Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday\\" are missing from it, I don't only own one Stevie album).  Buy it, slap it on, and enjoy!!
B000UD0ESA|1.0|I read that this was the greatest sci-fi movie ever made.  I love sci-fi but this movie sucked!  People say it has \\"intensely packed action\\".  It almost put me to sleep.  The themes could have made a good movie but this is a disjointed mess.  It takes place where the sun doesn't shine, literally, and it rains all the time.  Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer do OK with the script they're given.  The writing and directing are the problem.  It's VERY SLOW!  Wanna buy my copy?  Total Recall and iRobot draw the good points from this movie.  Get those instead!
B001PPLIFU|4.0|Movie was delivered quickly and well packaged.  The Blu-ray is amazing.  The quality of claritiy is the best.  Even though there is a price difference between blu-ray and regular dvd we will be spending the extra bucks!  How was the movie?  Still a big fan of the old James Bond.
B001RQ0SJO|4.0|Bat For Lashes is the pseudonym for Natasha Khan, a supremely talented singer/songwriter/musician/visual artist out of Brighton, England. I had heard some of her music a couple of years ago in the online Internet radio sphere, and while I liked it, it didn't quite make me seek out her music. However, \\"Two Suns\\", her second album, is one of the best albums I've heard in the last five years or so and a lot of people are taking notice. This isn't an album that's easily dismissed.    The opener \\"Glass\\" is a breathtaking journey into propulsive, primal drumming and haunting vocals dominating a soaring chorus. This has all the makings of being one of those tracks that I'll be clicking repeat on over and over. \\"Moon and Moon\\" is a simple piano led ballad/lullaby with a lovely chorus about lost love .     \\"Daniel\\", the album's first single, is an homage to a fictional character from a popular 80's movie that Khan apparently developed a crush on in her younger years. The dark, dramatic video for \\"Daniel\\" clues us in on who this character might be (as does the picture painted on Natasha's back on the cover of the single). Moving is the only way to describe the song, with 80's synths and strings carrying the melody throughout and the vocals as the centerpiece in one of the best choruses of the year. (Yes, she really knows how to write a chorus). There is a simpler \\"acoustic\\" version that Natasha sometimes performs live, and it's simply poignant.    \\"Siren Song\\" opens with gentle piano and vocals before building to a hair-raising crescendo of piano, keyboards and those primal, clattering drums. This song brings to mind Bjork and underrated 90's UK band Goya Dress. At times, there are some similarities between Natasha's vocals and Goya Dress's Astrid Williamson's.     \\"Pearl's Dream\\" has a bouncy rhythm and sound that one can easily imagine 80's Peter Gabriel singing over. It would be a good choice for second single as it has a catchy multi-tracked vocal in the chorus. And the end of the song is outstanding as she brings it to a close with the repeated lyrics \\"You know that it's time to go up, up, up, up, up/ Had a big machine riding your shoulders\\". That part of the song is one of the highlights of the whole album for me.    The whole album seems to be colored with the half-light of a permanent solar eclipse, when the moon, stars and planets are visible. And dreams and visions have an all too clear meaning. You can call out the influences on BFL's music. But that is just simplifying the matter. You have to really listen to the individual songs and lyrics. The way she builds on her influences is what is impressive.      Just as an aside - people should really check out the video for \\"What's a Girl To Do\\" (perhaps on YouTube) from BfL's debut album \\"Fur and Gold\\". Another example of BFL's brilliance and creativity.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|Whether you're a wrestling fan or not, this movie will keep your eyes locked on the screen. The story revolves around a \\"has been\\" wrestler who struggles to find meaning to his existence outside the ring. Failing desperately to make any meaningful connection he decides to let his love of wrestling be his salvation to the bitter end. The performances by the actors were real and emotional, keeping me watching to see how this tragedy ends. The way the camera follows the wrestler from behind in some scene, really helped portray the loneliness of the wrestler's soul. A well made movie all around. Definitely worth all the hype and acclaim from the movie industry and a must see for everyone.
B0000C8AW5|4.0|This is another great Dylan album. I would catagorize it as medium level as it doesn't have any greatest hits except for Forever Young which was made famous in a different way by Rod Stewart. It's got some great driving stuff and a real twangy sound provided by The Band. In \\"Something There is About You\\" you can hear the rolling sound of Idiot Wind and get a sense of where Blood On the Tracks was born. These songs are concerned love songs hinting at a last attempt before it's over.    Just remember, this album is a great stepping stone from the collection of greatest hits and legendary albums, to the next layer of Dylan's genius.    The remaster sounds great. It's nice to be able to pick out the instruments.
B0026GBIB6|5.0|After reading many negative reviews and references to similarities between SOTH and Playing the Angel, I was worried.  Playing the Angel was not high on my list of favorite DM creations, feeling too broken and fragmented for a nice, smooth listen.  I was relieved when I finally received SOTH - this is what I have been waiting for!  Back to focusing on use of Dave's incredible voice, with smooth electronic sounds that are distinct, yet somehow meld seamlessly into the songs.  I strongly recommend you find a really good car stereo, close your car windows, turn it up and just DRIVE.
B001TODCII|5.0|A former goverment agent is over protective of his daughter and does not want her to go to London. He eventually agrees to let her go but wants her to check in as soon as she gets into town but she forgets and he worries. The daughter and her friend meet a guy who seems nice but you know he is up to no good. We soon find out he finds American girls and kidnaps them and forces them into prostitution. Anywho, the agent is thrust back into work and vows to get his girl back at any cost. He goes all James Bond or Jason Bourne and goes to Paris (I cannot remember the country or city) and all hell breaks loose. The film is pretty much to the point and the action is non-stop and satisfying. It was over sooner then I expected but there was nothing left to do, every ground seemed to be covered. I highly recommend this to any action movie lover or anyone looking for a good movie.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This bluray version is awesome, hold your breath awesome!    A must own product.      I've shared it with many family members who also have bluray, some have decided to buy their own even after seeing my copy.
B000Z66RSS|1.0|I wasn't too satisfy with this product because it is a soundtrack CD , but all the songs that were in the movie were not on there, and songs that weren't in the movie was on there, just wasn't satisfy at all!!<br />Don't even waste your money....
B001EUMOP4|4.0|I first heard this record about 20 years ago, in my last year of college, when me and some drinking buddies had gathered at our bartender friend's house for an after-closing whisky drink (he couldn't start drinking til he closed shop).  He put this on and I was blown away - if whisky were music, this is what it would sound like.     I later went through all the phases - the early crooner Waits, the 1980s alternative drum-banging mind-bending Waits.  And I grew out of most of it as my musical tastes changed directions.  But today, I still love to sit down late at night, fill up my tumbler neat, and put on \\"Romeo is Bleeding\\" on the stereo.  To me this record defines what Tom Waits has been for me all these years.
B000001DVD|5.0|Perhaps the best hard rock album ever made...  Not a wasted track.   Leppard hit their stride here and never duplicated it.  \\"Pyromania\\" is  OK, but everything after is wretched.  It seems they tried to make dance  tracks for the girls and \\"reach\\" a wider audience, which I guess worked,  but I can't listen to any of it.  These songs capture a young man's   outlook on life.  They have been around the block, but they admittedly  don't know everything.  Life depicted here is booze, girls, music, and   more booze and girls, but there is an edge to these songs and things (as  in life) don't always work out - but they will take what's comin' to them!  And, I'll take this disc over just about anything else in the genre.
B0012GMVLM|3.0|It has 2 decent songs to check out \\"What Goes Up...\\" & \\"Pyramania\\".  Overall the CD was good, I liked it.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Cold Fact is the long-lost album from Detroiter Rodrguez.  Recorded during the heyday of Detroit Rock this album has a life of its own. It cannot die or pass away from neglect. Each song is a revelation in lyrical songwriting. Rocking the life of a street poet, Rodgriguez' takes on life, love and mindbending are as fresh and current today as when it was recorded (1970). \\"Sugarman\\", the album opener is an instant classic. My fave track is \\"I Wonder\\", the song that kept this album alive half way round the world.  This is a collector's dream and a must-have for anyone interested in purity, honesty and jams.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|The 1995 BBC/A&E Pride and Prejudice is already considered a classic. With a top-notch script, beautiful costumes and production design, sensitive direction and editing, and superb performances, this 6 episode TV dramatization of Pride and Prejudice is arguably the most faithful and engaging adaptation of Jane Austen's work ever created... and certainly the sexiest.    Until the release of this 2009 Blu-Ray edition, however, there had not been a definitive transfer of this film... not even in the original TV broadcasts, which, though fairly vibrant, suffered from less-than-perfect film processing and sound. To put it bluntly, the original prints of this film looked and sounded a little cheap, especially as transferred to video masters for broadcast.    Although the commercial VHS transfer was watchable, subsequent DVD incarnations were terrible, especially the widescreen \\"Special Edition\\" transfer which featured washed-out color and poor picture quality.    Thank Heaven for this 2009 Blu-Ray release! The film has been completely remastered from the original negative by an expert with good taste and judgment. The digital color correction and toning are superb, vastly superior to the original film print, and the attention to detail is evident. Sequences glow with the richness of the fabrics, the reflections, the candlelight, the sunshine... brass highlights look different from glass highlights which look different from skin highlights which look different from cloth highlights. The toning of each scene (where the general color palette is set, yellow-ish for candlelight, blue-ish for cold, etc) is subtle and appropriate. Everything in the picture looks crisp and fresh, the colors are rich and vibrant and clearly differentiated... you can even see variations in skin tones between different characters! Color and picture fidelity this beautiful is no accident, and requires great care and sophistication and taste. Vincent Ardutto (sp?), who oversaw this Blu-Ray transfer, is a real artist and should be commended for his superior work.    In short, this Blu-Ray edition makes the film look like a million bucks, and certainly must be considered the definitive printing of this movie. It revealed the lavishness of the production, which had been severely obscured in previous digital releases, and gives it a gloss which made me think of Dr Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia (which had not been the case in its original outing on TV).    The sound quality, too, has been cleaned and polished in a manner which leaves me full of admiration. The music sounds rich and full, and the voice tracks are spotless. The original soundtrack had some tape-induced bobbles in the music and imperfect sound in some passages. Now, the sound is pristine and rich and wonderful.    This Blu-Ray transfer is really a miracle! I can't recommend it enough. And if you've never seen this Pride and Prejudice before, you're in for a real treat!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana Krall nails the gold again. Her music is silky and the songs are beautifully arranged.  Great CD and well worth the money.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD.  It is set up with 3 20 minute workouts with each one getting a little bit harder.  I usually do 2 at a time, doing the harder one first and then the easier one.  It is great because it is set up so you are working with weights, then doing cardio, then abs so you know how much more time you have to go and it does go quickly!
B0015OKWL2|2.0|There is something amusing to me when people simply spit out famous actor's names and presume that means you are getting a good movie.  For years, people bemoaned Pacino and De Niro didn't really have a scene to together in 'Heat,' so I suppose this is their remedy.      Ah, this film is a masterpiece.  Two famous actors who have nothing left other than the relative fame of their names do what they do: act like De Niro and Pacino.  For years, people have extolled the virtues of their respective movies but what nobody wants to admit is that Pacino and De Niro have played themselves for years.  They don't really have any particular skill other than playing the same character over and over again.    Both men make the same faces they always make; Pacino requires a barking soliloquy at the end of each movie.   De Niro's mouth turns down at the corners all the time.  The acting is just silly; these are two overblown actors, at least a decade past their primes (likely more), together in a movie in the hope the combination of their respective names would somehow make these utterly unremarkable movie marketable.      You have to buy De Niro as virile enough to have Carla Gugino as a girlfriend and, in order to demonstrate his manliness, they have to show an elderly De Niro in various sexual poses which serve to disgust as opposed to convincing you he's a man of 'action.'  If you survive the gag flex of those utterly unnecessary scenes, you get the reward of two actors acting for a paycheck.  If you must watch this movie, get it from a library.
1416550542|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much!  What a great read!  No other words necessary....GET THIS BOOK!
B001IBIQU6|4.0|it seems like a lot of people were disappointed in the album.  while i have to admit, NOTHING on this earth can compare to dm's earlier works, [music for the masses--black celebration--violator; not even jesus could reach the bar that was set when these albums were created] sotu grows on you, and fast.  playing the angel bummed me out when i first heard it, but i still found myself singing its tunes over and over in my head until i started craving the songs themselves, and the more i listened, the more i loved it.  depeche mode is by far my favorite band of all time, and i think it would be virtually impossible for them to ever let me down.  i'm not quite biased however, for i have no problem being critical when i must. [i don't like the song \\"sometimes.\\"  it makes me cringe.]  i definitley wouldn't go so far as to say that this album tops anything else they've ever done, but really...is that even remotely possible?  personally, i like it.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Sounds of the Universe is Depeche's best album since Ultra, in my opinion of course. Exciter didn't excite me much...there was certainly an element or two missing there. And Playing the Angel is great, except the producer (same producer as SOTU) got a little too experimental and over-saturated the sound.    SOTU however, is very exciting, both creatively and audibly, and very well produced! From the SOTU session photos and blogs I've seen, Martin went a bit ape-crazy with the vintage gear and filled every nook & cranny he could find with it. So then, one *might* expect to hear early DM synth-pop? Not quite. SOTU progresses onward in the 21st century. But the soundscape is definitely remmeniscent of 70's and 80's electronica. You'll get a good taste of this with the opening track, \\"In Chains\\", as it opens much like an analogue synth version of an orchestral warm-up session. There is quite a bit less acoustical elements (ala Exciter), and more vintage analogue soundscapes, albeit, Martins guitars are still a main ingredient. Daves vocals couldn't be any better, he just get's better with age. Martin sings lead vocals for one song, Jezebel, for which he does in flawless fashion.     Recently, since writing my initial review, I bought the SOTU Box set [[ASIN:B001UE276A Sounds of the Universe Deluxe Box Set (3 CDs/DVD/2 Books)]] from Amazon for $72. This contains 3 discs, and 1 dvd (along with a bunch of other goodies). Disc 2 contains some bonus tracks, not found on the album. All sound great! My favorites are \\"Esque\\", a very ambient sounding track, unlike any DM song I've heard before. And \\"Oh Well\\" is also like no other DM song I've heard before - very EBM inspired. Also on disc #2 are six remixes from SOTU. Disc #3 contains 14 tracks of unadultrated demo tracks (quite interesting). The DVD blew my mind! In addition to SOTU and extra tracks mixed in 5.1 surround, there are session videos of the making of SOTU. Included are 5 complete session recordings (on video) of Martin, Dave, Fletch, and engineers/producers playing various songs, mostly from SOTU. I almost like these recordings over the album versions  especially \\"Come Back\\". I highly recommend buying the box version of SOTU over any other.    I can't say enough good things about SOTU, it's already a timeless favorite of mine! It stirs the spirit, and gets you in a good groove from start to finish. As with any symbious five-star Depeche album, it will take a few listens to really appreciate and discover The Sounds of the Universe.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Very odd and funny, but be warned there is a lot of stuff said that isn't for delicate ears
1416550542|5.0|This charmingly mysterious novel chronicles the the lives of three generations of English and Australian women beginning in the early 1900s. The story engaged my attention, and with many interesting characters, was easy and entertaining to read.<br /><br />There were lots of flashbacks but they never became confusing or distracting. The stories were intertwined well and unfolded in a logical and compelling fashion.
B001QB9H10|4.0|I was happy with the condition of the product and the timeliness of it coming
B000003GBN|5.0|I was astounded and overwhelmed by the interpretations AND the acoustics of these performances.  They have hardly been surpassed in the past 50 years or more.    The Coriolan Overture is especially sublime since the cello figures are outstandingly delineated and Reiner's interpretation ALMOST approaches that of Bruno Walter's classic reading on Sony.    The reading of the 7th Symphony ( the so-called \\"Dance Symphony) is especially fine.    Very highly recommended for all audiophiles and those who appeciate GOOD Beethoven.

B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Brick is not an easy film to take. It's a picture where if you choose to place yourself within the realms of reality, your going to find yourself hopelessly lost within this film's framework. The film is a High School film but not in the conventional sense. It's not a period piece, but is in a contemporary setting. The characters and dialouge are not the way real High School kids may talk, but that's not the point of the world created.    What this film is supposed to present is the world of classic Film Noir in a setting not very usual. If you can accept the fact of kids talking in 30s and 40s idiomatics than you'll be able to appreciate the picture.    The plot is a familiar one to fans of this dark genre: a young man is searching for the murderer of his girlfriend and is caught in a world of betrayal, murder and madness. It's amazing how captivating the film is and it looks like it was fun to do, since the dialouge, which may be laborious for some, is justifiably cool and absolutely fun to hear.    The characters are very engaging including a terrific lead performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has clearly left his \\"Third Rock From The Sun\\" days far behind him. He's effective as the loner, able to meld the right combination of world weariness and charisma to make the audience follow his story.    He's supported by a fine cast, all representing the genre's archetypes including the lovely Nora Zehetner as the requisite femme fatale who's got a thing for our hero. Her refreshing mixture of sexiness and vulnerability keeps her character sympathetic throughout. There's Noah Fleiss as the thuggish strong man of the town's leading drug dealer and he brings a suitable mixture of insanity and agression to his cliched role.  Top acting honors though must go out to Lukas Haas who portrays the flamboyant drug dealer \\"the Pin\\", a role the young actor plays with a suitable sense of dramatic bravado.    Direction is top notch and fast paced, the film rarely missing a beat asit moves through it's jagged and rough plot. The film at times comes dangerously close to being too self indulgent, but is able to walk it's tightrope with relative ease.    The DVD features some interesting extras including director's commentary(quite humorous actually) and deleted scenes. Nothing crucial, but interesting nonetheless.  The film is not for everyone, but for those willing to take a chance and if you have appreciation for the classic films of the Crime genre, you may find yourself enjoying this little indie sleeper.
B000001FUZ|5.0|Traffic's creative juices flow in each recording in its history.  John Barleycorn is no exception. It's much more listenable than some other Traffic recordings. The songs flow one to another, demonstrating what a good producer can do to a recording.  If you like such recordings as, for example, Super Sessions, you will also like this.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book since it was a refreshing break from much heavier non-fiction I've read lately including my 401k statements.  This was a fun story as in from-your-childhood.  It also gives you just a little glimpse (I wish it was more) of African culture apart from refugee camps we see on television, something I'm completely ignorant about.  The character development is fairly well done too.  However, if you are looking for a serious mystery book you'll be very disappointed.  There is not much depth, no intrigue, no mystery, no mental challenge.  This is almost a pre-teen book.  It is very simply written, as if Africans have a limited vocabulary.  Maybe most do, I have no idea.  But I almost think it is insulting.  I thought if the setting were \\"Kansas\\" instead of \\"Botswana\\" this book's style would be laughable.  Are we in love with the idea of a simpler world and culture perhaps? Is this an accurate portrayal of Africans? I'll continue to struggle with that question but in the meantime I've downloaded the next e-book in the series.  I like this simple kind of story-telling.  I have enough mental challenges elsewhere.  But I'm also going to check out The Poinsonwood Bible since others recommended it for a more serious look at Africa.
0743298039|4.0|The Thirteenth Tale is a wonderfully told modern gothic  story, filled with all the elements of that genre: An aging mysterious woman, a young woman who has lived a sheltered life, an old house, family secrets, hints of sexual obsession, madness, a governess, a devastating fire and a ghost or two.<br /><br />Vida Winter is a reclusive yet world renowned writer nearing the end of her life. For many years she has told wildly exotic tales of her life and upbringing, each more outrageous than the other, all without a grain of truth. When she reads an obscure biography written by Margaret Lea, Ms. Winter contracts with her to tell her life story.  As Vida tells the story of her life, Margaret is struck by some parallels with her own life and secrets. As she sets out to learn the truth of Vida's life, she also must confront some painful truths of her own.<br /><br />Ms. Setterfield has written a tale that is at times haunting and sad. Paying homage to some of the great Gothic tales of early years, and borrowing liberally from Jane Eyre, she tells a wonderful old fashioned tale with a surprising ending that is both shocking yet believable.

B001IBIQU6|4.0|By the third time through, I was officially loving this record. I'm one of those guys who enjoys both the upbeat, dancy Mode as well as the darker, more introspective Mode. This album falls completely into the latter and that's fine with me. It's still better than 99% of new music released today and will keep me entertained for many hours to come. Dave Gahan's voice is amazing on this one and Gore is back to playing with a bunch of cool, retro analog gear and making lots of cool noise.    To those who say it's a different band without Wilder...duh! Of course it's a different band and has been for quite a few years now. The chemistry with the three remaining guys is still strong and productive and that's the bottom line.    Don't listen to the haters here before listening for yourself and giving it a couple of plays to grow on your ears. If you have followed the band over their career and understand how they have evolved, I think most of you will love this one. I sure do!

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|In an era where countless non-talented slackers in tight pants and guyliner whine about how the world doesn't understand all the while playing the same three power chords, a savior has arrived in the form of three rockers from down under -- Wolfmother!  No hyperbole needed, this album is a hard rockin', psychadelic tsunami that shows real music is not dead.  The power trio of Andrew Stockdale, Myles Heskett, and Chriss Ross have delivered a mammoth masterpiece that is without a doubt the best album of the past decade.  Madness you'd say?  Go listen and then we'll talk...    The first thing that should grab you is the cover -- a painting called \\"the Sea Witch\\" by legendary artist Frank Frazetta.  In today's music, you'd be lucky to find an album cover that isn't just a generic pose of the band.  Onto the music!    The album kicks off with Stockdale laying out a banshee wail before the band kicks into \\"Dimension\\". The band pulverizes you with riff after riff of sonic thunder.  Just when you think the band can't pull out another riff, they turn around and throw in an even heavier one. For me, it's the best song of the entire album.    The band then change things up a bit with \\"White Unicorn\\".  With some interesting chord work, the group goes into Led Zeppelin \\"Houses of the Holy\\" territory in terms of fantasy imagery and and lyrical content.    Of course, the next track is \\"Woman\\".  At this point, you have to be living under a rock in order to not have heard this song.  Not a bad track at all though, it's just been WAAAAY overplayed.  I once read a post where someone remarked how the main riff of \\"Woman\\" was stolen from the Doors \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" -- despite the fact they're both in the key of E I don't see ANY similarities -- and this is from someone who's played guitar for nine years.    Next up, we're treated to \\"Where Eagles Have Been\\".  What I love about this song is its light and shade dicotomy -- soft verses and HEAVY choruses.  The build up at the end gets evenheavier.    \\"Apple Tree\\" is the only misstep in the entire album for me.  While not a bad tune by any means, it gets a little too repetitive and seems a bit out of place with the rest of the album.    \\"Joker & The Thief\\" is the second most overplayed song next to \\"Woman\\" but is still pretty sweet with its chomping chords and unique intro.    With \\"Colossal\\" the band moves back into bone crushing riffs.  Whenever I hear the lyrics, \\"the first time I saw colossal girl,\\" I thought Stockdale said \\"god\\" and pictured H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu rising out of his tomb at Ryleh.  Strange what music can make you think sometimes.    With \\"Mind's Eye\\" the band goes into a spacey, laid back jam that grows into a chorus that climbs with chord after chord until it reaches sonic bliss.  Check out Chris Ross' organ solo near the end -- Deep Purple would be proud.    \\"Pyramid\\" is a warped twelve bar blues that has possibly the heaviest bass line I have heard.  Nice.    \\"Witchcraft\\" is a sweet hard rockin' tune with a nice call and response between Andrew and the band.  It even has a FLUTE SOLO!!!  My friends and I crack ourselves by quoting Anchorman, \\"Would you like to hear Mr. Burgundy play some Yazz flute?\\" everytime the flute solo kicks in.    \\"Love Train\\" is the band's funkiest tune and despite what the Amazon site review says, it does NOT derail at any moment.    Finally, the band closes out with an (almost) acoustic piece called \\"Vagabond\\".  It's a simple little tune with some sweet melody and it shows that even three hard rockin' dudes can branch out into quieter music.    There you have it; thirteen songs, twelve of which are pure magic.  Just to get this out of the way, I know a lot of people like to criticize Wolfmother for being derivative of classic rock.  For all of you (especially Mike Patton) who make this claim, remember -- ALL music is derivative.  Nothing is completely original.  In regards to Wolfmother, while the band does embrace the 70's hard rock sound, they wear their influences proud and carry on the legacy of pure, hard rock.  That's very unique to find in an era of generic, commercialized corporate pop.      To Andrew, Chris, and Myles:  thank you gentlemen, it's been an honor.

0618001905|4.0|Hochschild spends some time in his book discussing Belgium's Royal Museum for Central Africa in Brussels, and how it has and hasn't refused to change in its view of the Belgian colonial period in the Congo. We visited that museum two years ago, and I kept vividly seeing it in my mind's eye as I read the book. By the time that I had visited, the museum had a half-hearted exhibit about Leopold's excesses, but much of the museum still kept its original flavor. I notice that when I check their web site today it says \\"As it's displayed now, the permanent exhibition still reflects the way Europe regarded Africa in the nineteen-sixties, despite a radically altered social context not only in Africa but here as well. One of the Museum's priorities now is the renovation and refurbishment of the Museum building.\\"<br /><br />So. Possibly the most interesting thing about King Leopold's Ghost is this notion of remembering, awareness and forgetting. Hochschild discusses what is not only a period of brutality and atrocity in the name of money, but also the way in which the society around the atrocities conspires to make the situation morally bearable-- in this case through a combination of religion, white man's burden, worship of the \\"noble savage\\" and fleeting public attention. Possibly the most frightening point that Hochschild makes is that Leopold was not alone in his treatment of Africa among the colonial powers. He is better remembered as a butcher than other world leaders because he was \\"caught\\" by a few people who struggled to expose the truth, and that truth was even more memorably shocking given his pretenses at humanitarianism.<br /><br />King Leopold's Ghost can be an awful book to read because of the facts that are described. This makes it even more important to bear witness, it seems to me. Apparently well researched, and is certainly well-annotated. The author makes a number of interesting points and connects them all in a readable and meaningful way. This reads like a book, and not a journal article writ large. A good thing.<br /><br />I was less enamored with Hochschild's attempts to psychoanalyze Leopold in an effort to understand what drove the leader to his acts. While interesting on the one hand, I find that it colors the reading of the book. Instead of understanding the Congo in terms of class and race, the takeaway is rather gossipy in the end. As though a King less damaged than Leopold would have been able to be a better colonialist-- an idea that actually works against some of the authors major points.<br /><br />Still, recommended.t a journal article writ large.

1416914307|5.0|All I'm going to say is that Cassandra Clare's plotting (so many twists!) is amazing and her writing for me is as near flawless as it can get.(Spoiler alert!!!)The only thing I thought she could have done a bit better in the book is Max's death. It was like he died Isabelle got upset and then no one really cared that much. A few days later Jace was cracking jokes again. It was unrealistic how they reacted I think they should have been more distraught and thirsty for justice/revenge. But it wasn't THAT noticeable as alot of other stuff was going on and it's a pretty easy mistake to forgive seeing as this trilogy is the best trilogy ever written ever :) Perfect ending.

B001FBSMF8|2.0|Like many, I have been a Chris Cornell fan since the late 80s. It has been interesting to watch him evolve as a musician and an artist. While I haven't agreed, and even liked, everything Cornell has done throughout his career, I do applaud the risks he takes and his attempt to do something unique and different.    And that is the problem with \\"Scream.\\" It is decidedly banal. There is nothing unique or different about it. Yes, this is a different style of music for \\"Chris Cornell\\", but in the realm of pop culture and pop music, it fails to be intrepid in any almost any way.    It completely lacks any edge or real imagination, and as a result, there is nothing in the music to stir or provoke. The best song is \\"Scream\\", and while it serves as an interesting pop anthem of sorts, even it sounds confined and hesitant.    I listened to the album three times and that's more than enough for me. I'm done. \\"Ground Zero\\" is semi-interesting, \\"Sweet Revenge\\" has a catchy chorus, but to be honest, I really can't remember much of anything else.     I'm disappointed not because Cornell decided to do pop when there are other artists like Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears who clearly do it better. I'm disappointed because it appears an opportunity was lost. I think Timbaland brought his A game to this record. The production is pristine and sharp and is really the only reason I gave it two stars.    It is Cornell that came up short. He had an opportunity to really put his stamp on a genre, to morph it and change it into something new. Instead, he took a big risk to take a safe road to nowhere. The best frontmen in musical history; Robert Plant, Ozzy, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, all took similar detours. Let's hope that Chris can find his way back.
B0017VG69U|4.0|This is a good compilation of these episodes at a good price, but if your a purist you probably won't enjoy how heavily they have updated the special effects.  It leads to a strange transition between 1960's quality television to 1990's quality special effect between scenes.
1569242739|5.0|As a vegan minority, most of my baking is done for omnivores. I don't think I have ever had a single complaint with any recipe I've gotten from this book--in fact, all my friends claim that if all vegan cupcakes tasted like this, they'd be vegan too. Regardless, this book has cemented my reputation as a fantastic baker, and all the recipes are simply phenomenal. From simple vanilla and chocolate to more elaborate carrot cake or crazy mucho margarita cupcakes, this book has something for everyone. If you don't own it and are a vegan baker, you are missing out.
B000N6TX1S|3.0|This movie is extremely successful in some respects but fails in others. As a near-future thriller this is one of the best films I've seen in years. The acting is excellent throughout, the production design top-notch, and the filming style is extremely effective, especially when dealing with the very visceral set pieces. The viewer is truly thrown into the thick of the action by the use of close-up handheld camerawork and very realistic pyrotechnics. The immediacy of the fighting in the penultimate scene is quite astonishing. Sadly it's the huge holes in the logic of the film that give it a hollow ring. The basic premiss; an entirely infertile population, is fine in itself, but it's actually the barbaric, and completely unexplained, treatment of foreign refugees that is the real driving force behind the story. Unfortunately we are treated to several clunky explanations for the infertility but never do we learn why, when the population is rapidly dwindling, and all the resources previously used for education have been freed-up for other use, we should have such feelings of animosity to everyone not born within the UK. Given that the film is meant to be a serious analysis of these themes it's a shame we're left so in the dark. Nevertheless this is a piece of intelligent and entertaining cinema.

B00171AEKW|5.0|It's not fashionable to admit that one has read something written by Adolf Hitler.  But, I did, in order to obtain balance from the other literature I've read and to better understand the psychological conflicts within the man.  First, Hitler was no intellectual lightweight.  I found that his analyses of military, political, historical, and economic affairs was quite insightful!  Not bad for an artist from Linz (beautiful town by the way).  Hitler seems to lose rationality and experiences emotional flooding when he discusses the aristocracy, the marxists, and the jews.  odd, in that it was the marxists who were supposed to rise up against the aristocracy.  karl marx was jewish i believe, so the source of his hatred against the marxists might have been from that angle.  it's amazing how all throughout the book, when it asserts a claim, he backs it up with brilliant logic and cites examples to support it.  always, that is, except where the jewish people are concerned.  there, the flood gates are opened and the ravages of hatred are unleashed.  given the level of hatred for marxists expressed in this book, i'm stunned that a brilliant tyrant like stalin would ever have trusted hitler's promise not to invade russia.  i had hoped to find more information on the financial sources that supported hitler's rise but it certainly wasn't to be found here.  this is heavy reading and, frankly, i don't know if it is because the man was evil or because i approached the book believing that the author might be evil, but, it wasn't easy to read.  nevertheless, for anyone who wishes to study history, ww1 or ww2, jewish studies, or political science (and, maybe even psychopathy), this ought to be required reading.  Oh, another downside, I felt that the organization was lacking and he rambled.
B00005IC2H|5.0|You might have found out about Sigur Ros through movies, such as Vanilla Sky and The Life Aquatic. The first time I heard about this band was when the single \\"Svefn-g-englar\\" was played on KROQ-FM radio, uncut. Ever since my older brother bought the album some time ago, I've taken a liking of the band's otherworldly music, some of which is so soothing to listen to. \\"Svefn-g-englar (Sleepwalkers)\\" is one of the most recognizeable songs on the album, and it is one of my favorites. \\"Star&aacute;lfur (The Staring Elf),\\" which is heard in the film The Life Aquatic, has a very watery atmosphere to it (I think that's why it was featured in the film). \\"Flugufrelsarinn (The Fly's Savior)\\" is one of the darker songs; it makes me imagine the mountains of Alaska and the Yukon during a cloudy dusk and dawn. \\"Ny Batteri (New Batteries),\\" one of the singles, contains some interesting instrumentations that grasp at the ears and never lets go. \\"Hjartao hamast (The Heart Pounds)\\" doesn't add much to the album, but when the heavenly \\"chorus\\" is heard, it's hard not to like the song. \\"Viorar vel til loft&aacute;r&aacute;sa\\" (Good Weather for an Airstrike) has to be one of the finest songs that Sigur Ros has ever created. The piano, strings, bass, violins, guitars, and of course, Jonsi Birgisson's singing voice are so incredibly divine that one has to wonder if these people made a visit to heaven sometime in their lifetime. \\"Olsen Olsen\\" sounds good in the first half, but the second half sounds a bit too silly and fails in comparison. \\"Agaetis byrjun\\" and \\"Avalon\\" make fine conclusions to this stunning album.<br /><br />I'm glad that my older brother introduced me to this album. Now Iceland has been added to my list of \\"Places to visit\\".

Overall it's a wonderful movie that I would recommend without hesitation.

B0015HOFZI|5.0|After failing to resurrect my old, unused Philips turntable, I bought this turntable.  Plugged it in to my Mac and it works fine....  I used both Audio HiJack and CD Spin Doctor...  I also tried out Final Vinyl and it works fine too.  So, even though Sony doesn't pack any Mac software with this, it does indeed work with a mac (OS 10.5.6 ... Unibody MacBook Pro).  Make sure the Audio Input is set to the USB Audio Codec  which will be present when the turntable is plugged in to the Mac.  I am very pleased with the sound... Created some MP3's with it and have renewed my interest in the thousand or so LP's I had stashed away...  A great turntable.  Listened to some of the mp3's on my Ipod while running this afternoon... couldn't be happier!
B001GKYBXA|5.0|This album is amazing, from first play.<br /><br />Electric Arguments has a youthful, exuberant, yet sad feel about it. One gets the sense the artist is traveling to that \\"final\\" place, but going out in Glory. Songs of light and soul-travel seem to dominate the theme. Paul's voice is as powerful and nearly as clear as ever. It's amazing too the extent to which McCartney's repertoire of styles is collected here on this one album. Some songs take you back to the Band on the Run Days, some back to his first two solo albums, some to the experimental electronica-laden McCartney II, and more. This may be one of his finest albums ever, maybe EVEN the finest, especially being the granddaddy rocker he now is.  All the while sounding completely off-the-cuff, natural and spontaneous.  Like an experiment gone wonderfully right.<br /><br />The opener, Nothing Too Much Just out of Sight, wails amazingly as if straight out of the White Album and moves right into the soft and jazzy Two Magpies (again, reminiscent of Blackbird), while the U-2-like Sing the Changes is anthemic and almost holy. The Celtic Travelling Light is mature and moves right into another rocker, Highway (harks back to a BOTR sound), followed by the gospelish Light from your Lighthouse.<br /><br />Everything's on this album -- a taste for everyone, a morsel of just about every Macca style. The track arrangements nicely alternate between rockers and hypnotic, soothing, and poppy music. My favorite song is Sun is Shining (very infectious and pretty, almost hippy in its eternal Paul optimism), Dance 'Til We're High is angelic, and Lifelong Passion (with its electronica) is experimental. Is this Love? is lamenting and longing and sad. Lovers in a Dream is of the nature-world with its electronic animal-like sounds. Universal Here, Everlasting Now captures in slice-of-life fashion the everyday moments forever; it is haunting -- as birds sing and dogs bark against a Revolution #9 type backdrop -- and eerie, like traveling the world in five minutes. Don't Stop Running is dreamy and yet energetic, and it mesmerizes, as the whole album does. Most songs run over 4 minutes long.<br /><br />This album is beautiful, anthemic, deep, high, spiritual, sad, childlike, mature, magnificent, and energetic and eternally optimistic. It is Paul McCartney epitomized, come full-circle.<br /><br />I love the minimalistic and childlike, primary-color accompanying concept booklet.  I only wish there was more in the way of text. Some liner notes or something. Some info on the collaborating artist, the instruments and equipment used. Some lyrics. Maybe I miss the point. I must confess the concept of this album escapes me (I must have missed out somewhere, as I read others' comments, and I must confess I've been a spotty McCartney fan over the decades). I almost gave this album 4 stars, only because I believed I preferred CCB and MAF, but the more I listen, the more I turn toward giving this album 5 stars after all. I really must. It's more subtle, and yet more grand -- and therefore a masterpiece.  A crowning achievement.  Especially knowing Sir Paul probably spat it out just like that.

If you haven't seen the film in a theater or on blu-ray, you really haven't seen it.

It was too much and the characters were rightly shown in the theatrical version.  This is a great movie with an impressive all-star cast.  The characters were strong enough to stand alone without any stephen king style over explanation.  If anyone knows if the original exists then please let me know.

031606792X|5.0|I read the reviews. I know that many thought this was the worst book in the series, so I went in to reading it with that mindset. The mindset that this book wouldn't live up to my expectations and that I would be left wondering why such a perfect saga ended in such a horrible way. But I honestly believed that this was the best of the four books. I understand that the story line had some unbelievable aspects to it, but that's what it is. A work of fiction. Just because this book has some elements to it that are hard to wrap your head around, it makes it a bad book? Isn't the premise of a vampire love story unbelievable as it is? I don't understand why this book got such bad reviews. It was great. Written uniquely from the other books, and I loved it. The ending was perfect, and the book had me turning pages. I think I read it in three days. Don't believe the book is bad from the reviews, read it and judge for yourself.

That said, here's how the back cover of mine reads:  *Costume Design featurette  *Set Design featurette  *History of the Five Points  *Exploring the Sets...With Multiple Angles Utilizing 360 Degree Shots of the Set  *U2 Music Video  *Discovery Channel Special: Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York  *The Five Points Study Guide  *Feature Commentary with Martin Scorsese  *Trailer  *Teaser  *French Language track    And, of course, it does offer English subtitles. The historical extras are excellent and informative, but the study guide was a little baffling: it's presented in text with no voiceover, and the font was so small I couldn't read it easily about six feet from my 32\\" tv. As far as documenting the film itself, the specials and trailers doa  good job of preserving the movie's history.     The fly in the ointment:  Like the Titanic 3-disc, Gangs cuts halfway through for you to insert the second disc, during the sex scene. Why you wouldn't put the movie on one disc and the extras on another is beyond me, but to cut it there? There are many complaints concerning this also posted on imdb, and no one seems to know why this decision was made. We may have progressed to the age of dvd and blu-ray, but we're still stuck getting up to change the tape.
B000A6T262|5.0|Wow! Not sure what happened but I'm glad I bought this set when I did. I bought mine for $72 directly from Amazon.com. Now it appears that people are selling it here for $250.    It's an excellent set for even non-trekkie's like myself. I grew up with these movies and with reruns of the TV show. Captain Kirk and James Bond (Roger Moore) were two of my earliest hero's in my pre-teen years.
B001N44BVQ|3.0|I saw this in theaters and bought the single disc. Beware: the single disc of this film has no special features. So if you're planning on buying it, it won't have a parred down version of the two disc features! It doesn't even have a special feature option on the menu, so you pay for the movie alone. Disappointed that the trailer wasn't even present.
B001TOD92C|5.0|A good movie comes out. Even rarer an excellent movie comes out. This is one of those occasions. This is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has substance and heart. Two qualities Hollywood is seriously lacking now days.    If you didn't enjoy this movie then go back to watching Hollywood remake and exploit all the old movies and churn out that same old Adam Sandler \\"Look at me!\\" garbage. In fact why are you reading this review. Too Fast Too Furious is calling you.
B001DPC4RS|5.0|For anyone who is into vinyl and into Van the Man this is a must have Lp. Kevin Gray has done his usual masterful mastering work on this project - he has remastered Moondance also and it is just as good! If your system is up to it and even if you just have a good rig you will hear nuances and notes that you never heard before even if you have an early Warner Bros. pressing. Highly recommended.

B000FA675C|1.0|Congratulations go to Dan Brown for writing a terrible book.<br /><br />I decided to read this book because so many praised it so highly.<br />To start: I couldn't care less about any controversial claims the book makes. It has no impact on the review.<br /><br />My issue with the book is how poorly it's written. I can't believe this isn't Mr. Brown's first book. The sentences are short and choppy, and the characters are flat and boring.<br /><br />Of course it wouldn't be an awful book without its factual errors. I'm not talking about the controversy about Jesus' baby. I'm talking about basic facts. For example, his incorrect translation of latin. And I know there were several more inaccuracies, but it's been years since I've read the book, so I've, thankfully, forgotten most of them. For those who say critics treat the content too harshly and give it too high of a factual expectation, that's ridiculous.<br /><br />Mr. Brown presents his book in our world, so the facts should line up. If he presented it in an alternate reality, then sure, some of the facts could be different. When an author tries so hard to make his main character (obviously an attempt of placing himself into his novel) intelligent and fills a book with meaningless, out-of-place facts about symbology and fails to accurately represent them, it's a disgusting failure.<br /><br />It's like he decided he wanted readers to think he was really smart and hoped they were stupid enough to not fact check.<br /><br />On top of that, the portrayal of the female character was insulting. She was treated as that pretty thing who is kind of smart sometimes when it doesn't make the men look bad.<br />He treats the reader just as bad at times.<br />I'm paraphrasing, but I seem to recall this one part that read: What many people don't realise is the cross people wear and celebrate was actually the tool used to kill Christ.<br /><br />Wow. Thanks for that.<br /><br />If you want to act superior to your readers, that's fine, but just make sure you have the intelligence to back it up.<br /><br />Thankfully, I managed to get rid of this book by placing it on the counter of the apartment I was leaving with a bottle of whiskey. Hopefully the next person reading it had more fun with it than I did.fine, but just make sure you have the intelligence to back it up.<br /><br />Thankfully, I managed to get rid of this book by placing it on the counter of the apartment I was leaving with a bottle of whiskey.

B000W4KT6E|3.0|As a fan of the original film I wasn't sure what to expect from this one.  Though not as edgy as the first this rendition didn't shy away from the content or occasional seedy remark, either.  I tend to wear thin as musicals but the director did a great job balancing dialogue with dance numbers.  All in all a pretty fun flick considering one moment it makes fun of Americana then attempts to make philosophical statements the next.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|The first time I listened to this album, the day it was released, I was initially excited for what I felt was a return to form.  As the album plowed on however, I became disappointed with the lack of diversity; the quirky, gear-shifting metal/pop/dreamy/acoustic style that Corgan (let's be honest, Corgan and Chamberlin ARE the Pumpkins) established up through Mellon Collie/Aeroplane is pretty much AWOL.<br /><br />So I put this one aside.<br /><br />Lately I've been loading up all my CDs onto the new computer I've purchased, and of course that's almost like digging through old photo albums - you end up reminiscing and and laughing and crying over every other album you dig up for an hour or so.  At least I do.<br /><br />Anyway, I made it to the S's in my collection and had been uploading and jamming on Pumpkins for a couple hours, and this one made it into the drive.  After checking this out again, it really doesn't seem as dense and one-sided as it once did.<br /><br />BUT.<br /><br />It IS pretty dense and one sided.  That being said, Zeitgeist really isn't far removed at all from Mellon Collie.  Take all the awesome heavy songs from that album, throw out all the softer, experimental songs, and strip away all the humor, and you end up with Zeitgeist.  It's kind of funny to me, because I was about 15 when Mellon came out, and it was amazing to me at the time (still is a great album in my opinion).  I recall the EP Zero coming out about a year later with The Aeroplane set and thinking, 'Holy Crap if they made a whole album like the Zero EP it would be the best Pumpkins ever!'.<br /><br />Well.... Here it is.  Machina was unlistenable to me.  This one is all of the heavy, less of the idiot (Machina), none of the fun (Mellon and prior). Basically the Zero EP extended.  There are some more whimsical, mellon collie moments, such as the final song, Pomp, but your ears are numb by the time it shows up.  If the tracks from American Gothic (the latest EP from Corgan/Pumpkins) replaced an equal number of the metal workouts on this album, it would have been a much different, more rewarding experience.<br /><br />Hopefully, Billy will one day recapture the glory the right way.  In the mean time, this isn't too bad of a rock album, but it's not that great either.  Three Stars.rkouts on this album, it would have been a much different, more rewarding experience.      Hopefully, Billy will one day recapture the glory the right way.  In the mean time, this isn't too bad of a rock album, but it's not that great either.  Three Stars.
B001F12J48|1.0|I bought the used copy of the 3D version which does include the regular version also, I did everything it said, dark room, TV brightness on high, used glasses properly, but no luck with 3D version coming out any good at all, I googled about this also and saw many complaints that it must be the DVD itself not done correctly in 3D, not even watchable really, unless you want to see double, very faded colors, on and on, look for yourself and save money and do not buy the 3D version.
1439136653|5.0|I finally convinced myself to watch this movie.     The movie really oversimplified too many things. I strongly recommend reading this novel, it's worth every second of your time!
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|I very much enjoy the artist's previous albums and listen to them ofter.  This one however, there was nothing new.  I was disappointed with the selection of the music, same old stuff with a \\"jingle bell\\" rock.  Maybe she needs to get out of the castle and into the mainstream for awhile.  This certainly was'nt celtic.
B0000027G6|3.0|The music is wonderful, the only bad experience I had was I requested a new cd and seller sent me a used cd. that was disappointed.

The Queen is a great film, along with Mirren's incredible preformance I think that Michael Sheen and James Cromwell(who doe a great British accent by the way,considering he's American!) did a great job as well!!! I'm glad this DVD is in my collection,and I will probably purchase the Blu Ray in the future!!! Recommended!!! A+

Not sure on the contents yet,but I'm sure the Blu Ray will have the same content that was on the 5 star DVD,maybe more if us we're lucky,we'll just have to wait and see!!! \\"That is all\\"!!!
B001ED7C58|5.0|This was a great purchase, because there were additional songs that were only available on the soundtrack.  Love the music.
B000127LW2|5.0|If your like me, you didn't get to watch this consistently when it was first out episode after episode.  If your like me you still don't get to when you find out its being shown regularly on some random channel.  I bought this because I knew the series was a good series, and because I wanted to see it in its entirety.  I would say the first episode is my favorite first episode out of all the other star trek series.  This is certainly a must have for anyone's sci-fi library.
B00005JM20|3.0|Rowan Atkinson is one of our great comic treasures.  With his hangdog looks his sense of visual and verbal slapstick is impeccable.  Even in cameos in \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and \\"Love, Actually\\" he steals the spotlight.  \\"Johnny English\\" is an OK film with it's fair share of laughs.  The ersatz Bond by way of Clouseau plot doesn't add anything new to the spy comedy genre.  This is far from a bad film just a tad disappointing.  I give \\"Johnny English\\" a marginal recommendation but Atkinson is best represented onscreen in the hilarious \\"Mr. Bean's Holiday\\".

B000UZNSWM|5.0|\\"The Coldest Winter\\" is a fascinating and insightful look at America's involvement in the Korean War.  Mr. Halberstam has created a very engaging read; this is no dry history text.  This piece uses the increasingly common approach of combining broad dissertations of history and politics with the experiences of individual soldiers and other players.  The result is an effective telling of the early and mid-stages of the Korean War.  Mr. Halberstam does not cover the war period after MacArthur's relief in a more than cursory fashion--in this sense the title is accurate.  The book deals mainly with the early stages of the Korean War.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Mr. Halberstam deals with America's China policy in much more detail than one would expect, given that the book is about the Korean War.  I found this to be helpful and interesting, as I had very little understanding of America's relationship with the Nationalist Chinese government.  Mr. Halberstam shows Chiang Kai-Chek to have been a masterful manipulator of the US Congress and government, in which he operated a powerful \\"China Lobby.\\"  Nothing new about foreign powers controlling the US Government as its policies affect them, apparently.  His insights about the interaction between Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung, and Kim-Il-Sung were similarly insightful.  This will be new material to most readers, and it is fascinating.<br /><br />The most important achievement of this book is to give the reader a solid understanding of General Douglas MacArthur.  History has not treated MacArthur kindly, and this book is an excellent example of this.  Mr. Halberstam makes a strong case that by the onset of the Korean War MacArthur was far past his prime, hard of hearing and surrounded by sycophants.  Most readers will be astounded to learn that all through the period in the Korean War in which MacArthur was commander-in-chief, he never once spent the night on the Korean mainland, preferring instead to run the war from his headquarters in Tokyo.  While Mr. Halberstam gives MacArthur full credit for the brilliant Inchon landing, he shows the reader that MacArthur's actions and orders after that point were ill-conceived and based upon self-serving intelligence estimates that the Red Chinese would decline to enter Korea.  Those familiar with MacArthur are aware that one of his acknowledged failures as a general was his consistent inability to use and consider good military intelligence.  This piece shows that there was abundant reason to believe that the Chinese would intervene in the war and that MacArthur's orders to his men to make a pointless advance to the Chinese border was motivated by hubris.  Even after the Chinese entered Korea, MacArthur's staff denied the evidence that they were in-country as long as they could.  Poor leadership at the Corps level caused most Army units to be unable to provide one another with mutual support.  The result was one of the worst debacles in American military history.<br /><br />MacArthur's conduct after General Ridgeway assumed leadership of the troops in Korea (under MacArthur) was flatly incomprehensible if one accepts Mr. Halberstam's analysis.  For apparently MacArthur was trying to pick a fight with the Truman Administration and knew that his relief was a strong possibility.  Evidently President Truman was correct that MacArthur was confused about \\"how the United States is run\\" and did not understand that he (MacArthur) was not a sovereign procounsel. Or perhaps he simply doubted that Truman had the guts to relieve him.  In any case, Halberstam shows that MacArthur's relief was not only a wise move, it was a vital one.<br /><br />Overall, this is a remarkable work about an underreported topic.  The Korean War was a seminal episode along America's path to world leadership, and this work aids greatly in understanding it, and the heroism and achievements of the men who fought it.ile Mr. Halberstam gives MacArthur full credit for the brilliant Inchon landing, he shows the reader that MacArthur's actions and orders after that point were ill-conceived and based upon self-serving intelligence estimates that the Red Chinese would decline to enter Korea.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|What can be more important than the food you eat? This is the movie that the American public needs to see. This movie deals with issues that each and every one of us faces every day--without even knowing it. Covering all sorts of food-related issues, from animal cruelty to the agricultural triumph of corn, this movie will leave you more informed than you were before, and will empower you to make a difference, at least in your own buying habits.    Take the time to watch. We're all slaves to the food system--at least educate yourself to how it works.

This movie did! it is clean fun,got a great adventure but also reminds us that one person can make a difference and not a small one...simple message but true! Enjoy that movie again because at the end of the day,from its music score to the story,it will make you feel empowered for the day for sure!  And if I am French and can dig that (I spent more than twelve years in the USA) then I know you will too...Au revoir...
B000WGWQG8|3.0|For a non-American, this portrait of a Founding Father. John Adams, his colleagues, adversaries and fellow revolutionaries is nevertheless fascinating, reminding us that these people were not gods, but flawed and struggling human beings.  The production is respectful without romanticising or falling into hagiography.  The love story 'B-plot', over fifty-four years, of John and Abigail is textured and affecting, particularly in the final episode.  As a drama, however, the story is at times plodding and the leaps in time, for those without a detailed knowledge of US history, can be confusing and dissatisfying.  It's not Jefferson's story, but the script is also a little coy about the Hemmings at Monticello...  That said, this is another production in which design, art department and special FX are totally integrated and impeccably researched and realised.

B0015D3Z4O|1.0|We all know Madonna is the queen of reinvention, not only with her music but with everything from fashion to her hair her love interests etc etc. Unfortunately the times of today have led us to the awful album which is Hard Candy. This album certainly left a bad taste in my mouth and not the kind of candy I want to try again, I didn't like 1 song on this album, I saw on one review a guy said it's her best album, what a joke. I only brought this album because I own all of Madonna's stuff so I have to keep the collection going but I was very disappointed, let's hope by the time she makes her next album the sounds of the day will produce better quality stuff from Madonna.

031606792X|5.0|I had read so many bad reviews of this book that I was almost afraid to read it. By comparison, I am a \\"newborn\\" when it comes to the Twilight series- having only within the last two weeks read the entire set, so I haven't the same attached devotion to particular characters or traits that many have. And, were I to rate the books in order of enjoyment, I'd have to say it would be 1, 4, 3,& 2, with book two being so bad that I almost decided to give the whole series up as a bad job.   Bella's perpetual selfishness and wallowing self-pity of book 2, not to mention her repeated using of her friend Jacob Black, were hard to get beyond, and considering that 99% of the book was about just such a thing, it was an effort to finish it.   By book 4 though, Bella finally develops the maturity of character that is needed in order to lay down ones life in order to protect something more important than her own existance, or to give the one thing you are trying to protect most to someone else in order to do just that. The fact she gets her fairy tale ending....nothing wrong with that, even though many seem to complain. Honestly, this world could use a few more fairy tale endings in this day and age.   Overall, these characters may have been fleshed out to a bit more of their potential, but I'm 40 not 14 so my palate enjoys more depth, but its the 14 year old that this series was written for and the author kept her audience in mind. Regardless, this book is definitely worth the read, whatever your age
B001FSDOZO|4.0|It's a rock band, of course it's going to be all about sex, drugs, and rock and roll. But for Nickleback this is quite an extreme. The guitars, the bass, the drums; I loved the entire ensemble of the music. It's just taken me some time to get used to the lyrics. It goes from extreme of I love you, I can't live without you, - to - you crack-head, I'm going to punch your face in. Somehow I feel like the heart is missing from the lyrical aspect. The music itself on every song is still fantastically created enough to the fact I can stomach the lyrics and appreciate the songs. Personal favorite that I'm certain is going to get overplayed air on radio: If today was your last day. This is a song to live by.

0061122416|4.0|From nearly 1,400 reviews, nearly 1,000 are favorable, There are over a hundred reviews that complain about the simplicity, nothing new under the sun. They are more complicated readers who perhaps like deeper philosophy books most people never touch.<br /><br />It strikes me the similarity of the Alchemist  to Rabbi Nachman's of Breslov stories: The Lost Princes, The Seven Beggars, The master of prayer. They were written 200 years ago, and they are still interpreted today. The erudition of Rabbi Nachman and his Talmudic and Kabbala interpretations are deep and hard to visualize without help.<br /><br />In 1802 Rebbe Nachman moved to Breslov, finding an allusion in the town's name to the future redemption. The verse says, \\"And I will remove the heart of stone from within you, and I will give you a heart of flesh.\\" The words, \\"A heart of flesh\\" (\\"lev basar\\" in Hebrew) have the same Hebrew letters as the word \\"Breslov.\\"<br /><br />This is exactly what Paulo Coelho does to us, the normal people who do not read much beyond the high school recommendations. He re-transforms  in flesh the anesthetized  hearts that we believed we needed in the fight for survival.
B000JIHP88|3.0|Our 5 month old baby loves the bright colors and soft music of this mobile.  It is engaging and fun but the lights are pretty dim and it doesn't have a light show like some others.  Also, we have not been able to get our remote for the mobile to work unless we stand a foot away and point it directly at the mobile.  Remote needs to be more sensitive. We do wish we had purchased a mobile sooner as it buys us 10-15 minutes to take a shower while she plays in her crib!
B001PPLIEQ|1.0|From an objective point of view it was an ok action movie.    From a Bond fan POV, where the hell was Bond? About all that I recognized was another stupid homage with a gal in oil and the now usual Bond as an outcast.    Oh yeah, the second disc was a complete waste. I LOVE special features and I could not even finish it.    Craig is still a good actor but let him actually play Bond for Gods sake.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Is it good or bad? It depends on what you want.    THE GOOD    - The fighting scenes are exciting, quick and deadly. Sometimes, they're too quick to see clearly.     - There many interesting stunts and special effects. For example, the scene where James Bond made the motorbike rider flipped 180 degree on his bike and hit the ground.     - Non-stop action from the beginning till the end.    THE BAD    - There's no sentiment, no love.     Even when human feelings are depicted, they're shown like cold facts not like touching moments. For example, Olga was scared stiff when the room was on fire after she shot the general. She's so scared that she forgot to try to escape. One of the reasons she's terrified because it reminded her of the moment where the general killed her father then set her house on fire. To soothe her, James Bond, just hug her and spoke to her in one or two sentences. There's nothing touching about that moment at all. I don't know why.    In short, this movie is worth watching because of the action. That's the only reason.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I loved this CD.  I have a problem finding a Michael Buble' CD that's not too jazzy for my taste.  I'm a traditionalist and I prefer a song to be sung the way it was written.  Finally this is a CD where Michael stuck to the original and chose some amazing originals.  I've listened to it dozens of times already and I'm still enjoying it.

I also have purchased several exercise DVD's and become bored after 1 or 2 sessions. THIS DVD KICKED MY BUTT AND IT REALLY WORKS! I started doing it 2-3 times per week and I have lost fat and my arms have muscle definition. I feel stronger and can do REAL pushups for the first time in decades. It is only 20 minutes but you feel like you worked out a lot longer because it is intense. Best $15 I have ever spent! If you stick with it you really will be \\"shredded\\" because you will use muscles you haven't used in a long time. All you need is some 4-5 pound weights. Jillian rocks!

It makes you wanna jump and move non-stop. It's so POP and up-beat from its start to finish. Even though the album has that instant appeal, there is still edge to it and depth about some songs. I love the fact that it's so catchy and happy, right-in-your-face with all that. It's almost shocking that someone of their caliber would make an album sounding like this. I personally think PSB hit the spot with this album. I also feel that this is the best album pop album that came out in years. I hope they get some attention for it. Hat's off to Pet Shop Boys!

B00006CXXU|5.0|After three studio albums & a greatest hits compilation, Stripped for me is still the best album Christina Aguilera had recorded.    Breaking away from the bubblegum pop sound she had on her debut, Stripped contains flavors of r'n'b, soul, rock, and blues. Her vocal prowess is strongest here. The vocal acrobatics that plagued her following album, Back To Basics, was only in small amounts here.    Stripped's winning factor however, is the emotional connection this can create to the listeners. I find myself uplifted after listening to the entire album. Different emotions could be felt in different songs as well.    Overall, Christina has to top this album yet.
B00079HZUM|4.0|I had never heard of this movie before, and rented it on a whim.  Though it's not my favorite genre, my wife and I enjoy the occasional historical drama.  We were both blown away by how great this movie is.    You might describe this movie as a cross between Shakespeare in Love and Dangerous Liaisons.  I reluctantly give it only 4 stars, but only because it is outshone -- barely -- by both of those two masterpieces.  And since I'm describing this movie in terms of other period pieces, I also view it as not unlike Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead.  Both R&GAD and Stage Beauty riff heavily off of Shakespeare and are just shy of perfection in that they aren't quite as emotionally captivating as the truly great historical dramas.    Stage Beauty is set in the time when women were not allowed to act.  All female parts were played by men.  The story centers around London's leading \\"female\\" actor, the toast of the town, and his chamber maid, a nobody secretly in love both with her master and with the allure of the stage itself.  The maid performs as London's first actress, illegally, to explosive consequences.  When the star discovers her crime, he is deeply threatened, as he has acted the part of women his entire life, and his identity is deeply rooted in cross-dressing stardom.  The battle lines are drawn!  I won't spoil the whole story.  Suffice it to say it's full of palace intrigue, sexual politics, divided loyalties, with imperfect heroes facing the competing impulses of betrayal and redemption.    Two aspects of this movie were utterly superb.  First, there is the profoundly deep and textured story line, with layer upon layer of meaning and emotion.  I suspect you could watch this film a dozen times and write an essay on its themes, and still find greater depths of meaning upon the next viewing.  Knowledge of Shakespearean plays will provide an additional dimension of enjoyment, but is not necessary to love the movie.  And second is Billy Crudup's Oscar-worthy performance.  I'm offended he wasn't at least nominated.  His scenes, both as man and as woman, are expertly acted, but what puts his performance over the top into greatness is his masterful use of gesture.  You rarely see such complex emotion communicated with a simple hand movement.    I would call this movie a \\"sleeper hit\\".  It definitely deserves better than the complete obscurity it seems to have found.  If you enjoy historical dramas or character studies at all, definitely give this one a try.
0451169514|5.0|This has to be my favorite Stephen King story.  Don't let the length scare you, it's truly an epic horror masterpiece.  After reading \\"The Stand\\" I devoured Mr. King's other books.  While I love \\"The Stand\\", \\"It\\" has depth and deals with horror in the mundane everyday world.  Mr. King has a way of ripping into the reader's nightmares and presenting them in an intense and unputdownable manner!  If you're looking for a book filled with thrills and chills \\"It\\" is for you!
B000FGGE68|4.0|Admittedly, if Milla Jojovich was not my favorite female action-star, this film would not have gotten 4 out of 5 stars, but then again, no less than 3. Heavy on the effects-laden action sequences and set against a sci-fi dramatic backdrop it's the story of soulless humans out to exterminate the lab-virus-gone-amok infected oppressed, who at times are more humane than the humans. Can the infected UltraViolet save the young human boy from the evil human ArchCardinal who is out to destroy them both?
B0018CWWLE|5.0|This is the result of so many years gathering experience and loving what they know best.You ask yourself, what is progressive Rock, well my dear friends, this is one of the best demonstrations.

B001TOD92C|5.0|Just let Mickey O'Rourke take you to a place that very few actors can take you. He has achieved the kind of acting which is beyond acting. He just exists as this character and as no one else. This wrestler is Mickey and Mickey is this wrestler. It's like watching Brando as The Godfather...he just IS that character and the script, the scenery, whatever else is going on just doesn't matter. It's all about falling into the depths of this character and finding there is no bottom to the pool...as far as you want to go down and into this character, Mickey O'Rourke takes you there....

B000UFLSBA|4.0|Zdravstvuj, this review is for SLEUTH / (PAL DVD / IMPORT) 1972. Be sure you are clear on the fact the front and back of the DVD box is all in Russian text (only the square insert shown above here is partially in English in the middle of the front), the DVD menu is all in Russian. You will need to select the third Russian word down to get into audio. Next select the word that starts with an A. Then the word below the default P word unless you want Russian subtitles. If you don't speak Russian it is very difficult to negotiate the menu to select Audio English. I was overly anxoius to get this out of print US Region 1 movie so I bought this PAL version.<br /><br />If you don't mind negotiating a Russian menu, it is a fair price compared to what the greedy people are charging for the English Region 1 version. I suggest unless you are a huge fan of the movie like me you may want to wait for a reprint in English. The movie itself is a delicious game of cat and mouse. When an author played by Sir Laurence Olivier finds out a man of no means, played by Michael Caine, wants to marry his wife he sets out to do the perfect murder. These two great actors do an excellent job of trying to outwit and kill each other. Based on a hugely successful play, the whole movie mostly takes part in the confines of the authors house. I managed to get it set in English audio and the movie is an excellent copy, clear and sharp picture and sound. Great replayability. If you want an English PAL DVD instead, check out [[ASIN:B001C3XMO0 Sleuth [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Great Britain ]]]. Dos vidaniya!<br /><br />CA Luster
B001MW0J2O|4.0|The album is still growing on me. Less listener friendly than older AC but equally brilliant.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|On PYRAMID, Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson prove that they haven't run out of important lessons to teach. Far from it. The song \\"Can't Take It With You\\" has a message that our souls are our most important asset, and that even a rich person living in a wealthy neighborhood (e.g. Seattle's Denny Blaine or Magnolia; Portland, Oregon's Healy Heights, SWHRL, Hillside, or Sylvan-Highlands neighborhoods, as well as the suburban Dunthorpe, Riverwood, and Riverfront areas; Bethesda, Chevy Chase, or Potomac, Maryland; or Marin County, California) can be poor if he/she has no inner peace. Overall, this album seems to be about superstition, which I'm no stranger to, as I try to make sure that I pick out good CDs by wearing the same clothes each time I go music shopping. This is the Alan Parsons Project's most underrated album ever, and deserves to be rediscovered.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is the first Blue Ray movie that I purchased and I definitely was not disappointed. I enjoyed all the Matrix movies very much prior to this purchase, but Blue Ray makes the movies come more alive and realistic, almost like it's taking place in your living room.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|This was a good, heart-wrenching movie with a cliched ending, and good music score.  But best picture?  Wow.  Must have been a bad crop this year.  I enjoyed the film, its depiction of Jamal and his brother growing up as slum dogs, but there was something contrived about it as well.  Still, it was above average and kept me interested.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is absolutely, unquestionably the very best Stevie Nicks CD ever!  I'm a huge fan and truly enjoy all of her previous albums (especially the first three), but Trouble in Shangri-La is definitely the ultimate!  I love how deep, rich and earthy her voice sounds now.  I also really enjoy all of the collaborations with Sheryl Crow, Sara McLachlan and Natalie Maines.  I cannot believe that this particular CD didn't sell better than it did (I think that it is certified gold right now).  I also cannot believe how cheaply amazon is selling it for...it is worth three times the asking price!  If you enjoy Stevie Nicks at all, then you definitely need to purchase Trouble in Shangri-La!

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I've got a small project studio and needed a pair of decent headphones for monitoring.  I didn't spend too much time investigating the different makes/models...I knew AKG had a pretty good reputation and I expected the K240's would be a definite upgrade over the consumer-grade cans I was using.<br /><br />Now, I'm not Daddy Warbucks, so $100 was a fairly substantial investment for me for just a pair of headphones, but I'm satisfied with them.  They seem to represent the sounds nice and clear...I'm not going to get into what the frequency range is or anything like that because I'm honestly not that technical.<br /><br />The headphones seem to block out the majority of the noise in the household.  The only minor complaint that I have is that prolonged wearing of these headphones seems to bother my ears.  I don't think I have huge dumbo-like ears, but maybe I do!<br /><br />In my opinion, these are a worthwhile investment although I must also say that I have no other pro-grade headphones in which to compare these with.  If you're like me and you were using a pair of $10-30 headphones that you bought at Walmart...you should be happy with the K240's.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|Despite all the negative reviews, I believe that SOTU is a very good descent CD. It's very clean and soothing. One can actually appreciate the sound. The usage of vintage synthesizers was an excellent choice; and in my opinion they are played properly with a modern twist to it. I can't understand how people can rate this CD so low; it's not bad at all. If Depeche Mode were to stay with the same style and sound, it would become monotonous and boring! I'm listening to SOTU everyday and the more I listen to it the more I like it.

0575079002|5.0|Robert Neville is the last man left alive on Earth. At least that is how he looks at his precarious situation. Those soulless vampiric creatures outside are clearly not alive but simply undead. Each night is for Robert a battle for survival. But each day he finds it more and more difficult to obtain enough energy to go out to find food and supplies. Being an academic he is capable of investigating the cause of this worldwide apocalypse, but more importantly finding a way to finish the evil outside. Lately his investigations are not delivering any conclusive results. On the verge of giving up all hope Robert meets a seemingly uninfected women, Ruth, abroad in the daylight.<br /><br />With I am Legend Richard Matheson has created a milestone of post-apocalyptic fiction that has set the standard for many works that followed. The utterly concise and measured narrative is showing its sharp edges when describing the desperation that the main character of Robert feels. As a reader you get sucked into the experience of dread from page one. On top of that the author adds excellently crafted suspense scenes that makes you want to turn the pages faster than you can read. But the best part is definitely the denouement, where the build-up of the story delivers one of the best final chapters of any horror novel. I am Legend is not only an immensely scary novel, but has a profound sociological and visionary message that we should take at heart now more than ever in times where living together with other people is often seen more as a thread than an opportunity.
B00260HH3K|5.0|Well, you can rip it apart all you want, and whine because it isn't 100% accurate to the Manga or the Anime, but the movie has the spirit of the original. I'm a fan of DB and DBZ and after watching the horrific trailers I almost didn't go to see this movie. But James Marsters, I could not pass up, and I was pleasantly surprised!     I do admit the movie is not without flaws.  Instead of making this movie for older fans of the series as they should have done, the producers clearly copped out and aimed the movie for a much younger audience.... The results are sort of what you would expect, the movie runs long at a quick pace of a small child in the throes of a sugar high: Frequent but short action sequences and a lot of glossed over plot points.  Some plot points could really have benefited from a little more explanation, but even without, the movie is not difficult to follow or figure out and the action is decent. The story is modified or course, updated but still in the vein of the original, with plenty of nods and cheesey moments from the Anime version to at least mollify the older fans of the series including a lecherous Master Roshi.    I could have wished for longer fight scenes, and definitely more screen time for Piccolo(I suspect both these wishes were curtailed by budgeting), but for what it was, Dragonball evolution hit the spot. No adaptation can be perfect, and when you are condensing a huge volume of story and nuances into about an hour and a half, guess what, its not all going to make it. And any one with common sense should know better than to expect it too. I went in expecting crap, and was happily surprised and entertained instead. I'm not saying you should buy it, but if you were a fan of Dragonball before, at least give it a shot and go rent it. You never know, you just might be pleasantly surprised too.    If nothing else your kids should like it.
B001E5FYS8|1.0|I am shocked to see so many great reviews on this documentary. Its almost as if people are afraid to say how unsatisfactory it is.<br />It starts off exciting, the young boy finds a newspaper article about towers being built in the US. the viewer falls in love with this adventurous young man, and roots for him to succeed in his elaborate plan.<br />there's plenty of play-acting to enhance the tense moments when they were *almost* caught etc. but when it finally gets to the climax of the story, the actual deed, the walking of the tight-rope... the story just dies. After all those preparations, all you see is a few seconds of the tight-rope footage!<br />It seemed like the film makers just wanted to end the story quickly. they didn't show the viewer anything after the final success of the great \\"caper\\", just a quick sex scene which was totally not in place, and then a few words from the abandoned friends.<br />It was disappointing in such a big way because throughout the documentary everything was so detailed, while the end, which was supposed to be the most exciting, was just so rushed, so unexciting, a non story.
B0015AARJI|2.0|Far from the fawning, doting, feverish reviews of the Dualshock controller posted elsewhere, it's time for a reality check. Whilst the ergonomics of the Dualshock are identical to the original PS3 Sixaxis controller, it's too heavy now. The original controller was fantastically light and nimble to hold - a real advance in user-friendliness and a delight to play games with. The new Dualshock feels like a housebrick in comparison. Obviously the added weight is in the motors and offset weights for the rumble feature, but it just feels clunky and awkward and a bit 1980's.  The plastic is different too - the original Sixaxis had that lovely translucent plastic where you could almost see the inside of it, but not quite. The Dualshock is just plain old cheapo black plastic.  On top of that, there's the battery life issue. I've had my Dualshock for two weeks now and it needs charging twice as often as the old Sixaxis controller. The odd thing is that it needs more charging even with the rumble turned off, so I'm not sure what they've done here.    All I wanted was a replacement sixaxis for my original one, which because of too much Call Of Duty 4, has given up the ghost. It seems that Sony in their infinite wisdom have decided that no, you can't have that, you must buy the new, heavier, more power-hungry controller.    So: gone is the lightness, gone is the next-gen look with the translucent plastic, and gone is the battery life. My advice - if you don't need rumble (and frankly, nobody does - it's a ridiculous addition that I never understood) - look elsewhere or get a secondhand Sixaxis.

B000P12LWY|5.0|The Mrs. and I were pretty big fans of many HBO shows: Six Feet Under, Sex and the City, Curb Your Enthusiasm, but now many of our favorite shows are on Showtime.  Our two favorites are \\"Dexter\\" and \\"The Tudors\\".<br /><br />People who get their panties all in a wad over things like \\"historical accuracy\\" can't wait to pounce on this fictionally skewed storyline.  I'm not as tore up about it, knowing some of the historical differences.  I think that \\"The Tudors\\" stays pretty true to the historical spirit of Henry VIII, and hardly any of the artistic deviations are a detriment to knowledge of the \\"Historical Henry\\".<br /><br />The production is rich and lavish.  The only series in memory that compares was HBO's \\"Rome\\", which we loved, but shut down after only two seasons mainly due to the cost of producing the thing.  Knowing that \\"Rome\\" was split between HBO, BBC and RAI (the Italian BBC) makes a production like \\"The Tudors\\" heady stuff.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as Henvy VIII, the second Tudor King.  Henry became King after his older brother, Arthur, died.  Henry's father, Henry VII, gained the throne from Richard III, ending the Wars of the Roses.<br /><br />Henry VIII married Arthur's widow - Catherine of Aragon, daughter of famed Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain.  By all accounts Henry loved Catherine, and he was married to her longer than his other six wives combined, from 1509 to 1533.  Catherine was six years older than Henry, and bore him four children, but the only one to survive into adulthood was daughter Mary.<br /><br />Henry, a devout Catholic, commisioned his religious scholars to write \\"Defense of the Seven Sacraments\\", in opposition to Martin Luther's protestant reformation.  Pope Leo X conferred upon King Henry the title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" - a title that the English monarch carries to this day.<br /><br />But when Catherine gave Henry no boys and her age began to make that less likely Henry was in a bit of a political pickle.  No woman had ever ruled England, and at the time it didn't even occur to Henry or anyone else that one could.  No - Henry absolutely had to have a son.  (There were many ironies - a mistress gave birth to Henry Fitzroy, an illegitimate son, and daughters Mary and Elizabeth both ruled England after the death of their younger brother Edward.)<br /><br />Henry also was falling under the spell of Lady-in-Waiting Anne Boleyn.  Fifteen years younger, Lady Anne also seemed capable of giving birth to a son.<br /><br />Season one of \\"The Tudors\\" deals with this time-period.  Myers, in his late 20s, is a little young to play the Henry who was past forty when he finally married Anne Boleyn.  But the casting makes sense: many familiar with Henry VIII are most acquainted with his portraits and portrayals later in life, when he had gained considerable weight as a result of a never healing leg ulcer.  (As a physician, I often reflect on how different the life of Henry would have been with availability of modern medicine.  The leg likely could have easily been treated.  Surely at least one of Catherine's sons would have lived...)<br /><br />Sam Neill is excellent as Cardinal Wolsey, the kind of Priest Luther complained about, more than willing to sacrifice his religion for political or financial purposes.  Maria Doyle Kennedy makes a superb Katherine of Aragon - I have no problem believing this woman loves Henry, loves her faith, and descends from Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain.<br /><br />Natalie Dormer brings a saucy, eager, conspiratorial willingness to the role of Anne Boleyn.  Jeremy Northam is sublime as the Sainted Thomas More, a perfect Renaissance man equally comfortable and fit in the worlds of the church and the state.  Peter O'Toole lends his weight to the part of Pope Paul III.  Nick Dunning, as Anne's father Thomas Boleyn, is perfectly willing to urge her daughter to use every trick she has available to gain the favor of the King.  Gabrielle Anwar plays the King's sister, Margaret. (Yes, yes, yes, we know Henry had two sisters.  Unwad thy panties.)  Henry Cavill grows perhaps as much as any actor in the course of the series as Henry's best friend, Charles Brandon, who becomes the Duke of Suffolk.<br /><br />The pertinent aspects of this part of the life of Henry VIII ring true.  The screen is full of heaving bosoms and candle-lit trysts.  The acting, editing, music, set decoration, etc are all top notch.  If you're at all interested in historical dramatizations, I say \\"The Tudors\\" is an entertainment of the highest order.Henry Cavill grows perhaps as much as any actor in the course of the series as Henry's best friend, Charles Brandon, who becomes the Duke of Suffolk.

B000ZNRBK4|5.0|The lens hood can be secured to the Nikkor 18-55mm lens in reverse orientation; this is how I carry it in my soft case or camera bag or at night.  Even with it secured in reverse you can still turn the focus ring manually.  It clips on fast and easy and is made well.  If you plan on keeping your kit lens for a while this is a must-have and a no-brainer for the price (under $20).  I only wish this hood had come with my D60 camera kit in the first place!
B001EO748M|5.0|\\"The Tudors\\" charges through season two with more of the backstabbing politics, greedy hangers-on, steamy bedroom scenes and pious prayers that made season one compelling from beginning to end.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Meyers returns as Henry VIII, who is now married to Anne Boleyn, played brilliantly by Natalie Dormer.  Dormer conveys as much with her facial expressions as many actors can accomplish with their full performance.  Katherine of Aragon is in isolation, cut off not only from her husband of many years and her place on the throne, but also, cruelly, from their daughter, Princess Mary.  Maria Doyle Kennedy is one of the strongest assets of the series.<br /><br />Jeremy Northam is superb as the Man for all Seasons, Thomas More, Henry's friend and wise, trusted, spiritual advisor, who can't bring himself to say that in religious matters the King's word is superior to the Pope.<br /><br />This season is more historically accurate than season one, which writer Michael Hirst said was \\"85% accurate\\".  But this season also shares the consummate production values of the previous work.  The sets, costumes, music, editing, cinematography and acting are all first rate.  If you liked season one, I daresay you'll like season two as well.  If you're interested in historical dramas with a tad of artistic license - I recommend you start back at season one.<br /><br />The Mrs. says this is one of those shows you KNOW is good, because as soon as one episode ends you can't WAIT for the next episode.  The Mrs. is wise.
0812589041|5.0|I am not much of a fiction reader.  I discovered this book only recently.  It was a quote on a license plate frame, a middle-aged woman driving, and I don't remember the quote exactly but I remembered \\"Ender's game\\" and my curiosity drove me to Google it, which led me to buy this book.  I guess it's quite popular to be quoted on a license plate frame 30+ years after it was originally published, eh?   I thought the military leadership lessons that Ender learned were enjoyable to follow and I was very impressed by the quality of writing, the characterization, the LOGIC of Ender.  I have a limited science fiction depth of reading experience and \\"Death Star\\" was my previous novel to this one.  I've read a bit of Frank Herbert and Carl Sagan but mostly I stick to Star Wars for sci fi books.  The day I finished reading Ender's Game, I bought Speaker for the Dead (loved it) and the day I finished Speaker for the Dead I bought Xenocide which I'm in the middle of right now (loving it).  Orson Scott Card has converted me into a science fiction chain-reader and not a day goes by that I don't read.  Thank you Mr. Card!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I've long been a fan of the supernatural/paranormal/intelligent horror genre, and I can honestly say this is hands-down my favorite TV show of all time. Definitely one of the best shows out there - excellent writing, great acting and intriguing story lines.  There's episodes that are laugh-out-loud funny and ones that are genuinely scary (particularly in the first season so if you haven't seen it yet check it out!)  The family dynamics between the three Winchesters are well portrayed and the writers have done a fantastic job developing the story line across all four seasons.  Do take note, though - this is definitely not a show for the kiddies as some of the episodes get pretty graphic.  I can't wait for Season 4 to come out on DVD and here's hoping for a Season 5!

B0000549B0|5.0|We recently revisited this old friend, and HARVEY is one film that surely stands the test of time.  This is Jimmy Stewart at his best:  sweet, polite, and happy.  HARVEY is an excellent choice for a lazy Sunday morning with the entire family.<br /><br />Elwood P. Dowd has an imaginary friend, whose name is HARVEY.  HARVEY is an invisible, 6 foot tall, white rabbit, who accompanies Elwood everywhere.  Ever polite, Elwood introduces HARVEY to everyone he meets.  However, since only Elwood can see HARVEY, most folks think that Elwood is crazy.<br /><br />But is Elwood crazy?  That question is left for the audience to ponder.  The fact is that it doesn't really matter if Elwood is crazy.  Elwood is kind, polite, pleasant, and always has a good time right where he is.  It just doesn't matter if he has a giant, talking, white rabbit for a best friend or not.<br /><br />The story of HARVEY is delightful and engaging. Jimmy Stewart is at his very best as Elwood.  The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding, including Josephine Hull who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Elwood's sister.  Of course, HARVEY is excellent as himself.  The black and white cinematography is gorgeous!  The play of light and shadow gives this movie a calm, dreamy quality that could not ever be duplicated in color.<br /><br />On my DVD, Jimmy Stewart gives a marvelous, sentimental introduction to HARVEY.  As part of the introduction, Mr. Stewart said that people still stop him on the streets and ask if HARVEY is there with him.  At first, he thought people were pulling his leg.  But he soon came to realize that folks were serious.  They wanted to meet HARVEY and give him their regards.  It seems that many people a have friend like HARVEY that they talk to about their problems, and they wanted to let HARVEY know that they believe in him.  This charming story brought a tear to my eye.  The world would probably be a much better place if there were more HARVEYs and more Elwood P. Dowds in it.
1400032717|5.0|This book is an outstanding achievement.  By its first-person telling, from the perspective of a boy with Asperger's Syndrome, it provides an extraordinary vision of what such a mind, and such a life, is like.  Outstanding observation skills and great intellectual power in many areas, paired with absence of emotional intelligence, emotional feeling and other problems.  All these things, and how the world would seem to someone who had them, are vividly demonstrated through this first-person narrative.  On top of that, it is done with humor, plot, pacing, and consistency.  The temptation to lapse into shorcuts or maudlin deviations are scrupulously avoided.  The book remains true to its vision from start to finish.  It leaves the reader, at least one lacking personal experience with individuals with autism or related difficulties, with a new understanding and lasting impression.  All of this is accomplished in a compelling and, yes, enjoyable read for an adult or a teenager.  A fun sidelight is the narrator's frequent digressions into interesting trivia -- be it about prime numbers or life beneath the ocean's surface.       Caveats:  First, I don't know whether the Asperger's vision it projects is real or not.  From glancing at Amazon, the consensus seems to be that it is, but it also seems that in some ways that answer is unknowable.  Second, this is not a children's book.  My thirteen-year old read it with me and enjoyed it as much as I did, and young adults can certainly handle it.  But Catcher in the Rye and Lord of the Flies are on 8th and 9th grade reading lists too.  The book could be disturbing to a child too young to abstract from the narrator, and will not seem a \\"kid's book\\" in any way to an adult.  Third, the basic story arc---teenage boy and family struggle to deal with consequences and stresses of family break up---is remarkably commonplace.  However, this is barely noticeable, a testament to the orginality and success of the book's form.
0757302661|1.0|I've had 3 natural births, and the last one was after reading this book.  I can honestly say that this book did NOT magically make it not hurt, even when I used the goofy doublespeak she advocates, like \\"surges\\" for contractions or \\"membranes releasing\\" for water breaking.    I do not think that the discomfort of childbirth is too much to handle without drugs, but I don't think it's doing anyone a service by claiming that if they would just relax and not be \\"afraid\\" it wouldn't hurt.  I think that sets women up to feel like a failure when it does (surprise!) hurt.   And, honestly, \\"breathe the baby out\\"?  Give me a break.  When those pushing contractions come, you want to PUSH not just sit there inertly waiting for your body to do it without your active participation.    I think it makes more sense to be upfront that it will hurt, but encourage women that they can handle it, that they are strong and powerful and up to it.   This is not the book to take that approach, and I would not recommend it to anyone.

032147404X|5.0|I like The Digital Photography Book because it is packed with quick tips from how to improve your flower photography to how to keep your subjects from blinking and ruining your shot.  This book tells you what setting to use for the occasion and lighting, not necessarily the why.  Each tip is kept to one page and although most could easily read through the whole book in a day, you will return to reread the tips often.  As your photographic images improve, and they will improve, you will find your walls filling with the results of your labors.

B001AKTZO6|5.0|Around the turn of the century the long neglected Creedence catalog was suddenly appearing in new upgraded editions with cynical regularity. I bought the Steve Hoffman vinyl remasters, which are fine if hard to find. A 2000 CD reissue program was rendered unnecessary by the release - one year later - of the CCR box, with the entire catalog, plus previously issued live albums (\\"The Concert\\" from 1970 and the 1971 European set) in one nifty little box that offered familiar liner notes (Ed Ward, Joel Selvin,etc) and one disc to bait fans - a full disc of pre Creedence material that offered a fascinating revisionist essay by Alec Palao and 25 tracks - some originally issued on singles, some not - recorded during 1961 - 66, as the group struggled to make a living and develop the astonishing musical identity that felt so utterly \\"natural\\" by 1968.   These tracks are an uneven lot but many are surprisingly good, as young John Fogerty grew to be the major talent and visionary, leaving older brother Tom (who had started the band a decade before the debut Creedence album) in the humble role of rhythm guitarist...  Now it did seem a bit odd that the box offered no real rarities from CCR's 1967 - 72 period, when they were at absolute creative and commercial peak. After all, after the first album was released in June 1968, production chores were assumed by John and three seamless classics quickly followed, \\"Bayou Country\\" (January 1969), \\"Green River\\" (August 1969), and \\"Willy and the Poor Boys\\" (November 1969). \\"Cosmos Factory\\" (July 1970) and \\"Pendulum\\" (December 1970)  completed an astonishing ruyn and one dazzling and enduring body of work. 1972's \\"Mardi Gras\\", recorded after Tom's 1971 departure, contains some good songs, but is an anomaly in the band's catalog, with drummer Doug Clifford and bassist Stu Cook composing (and worse, singing) two thirds of the material, a failed attempt at democracy that led John to split fpr a solo career by the end of the year.  So here we have the classic CCR albums, remastered once again, and finally packaged with all the original LP graphics (except those \\"Fantasy presents...\\" lablels, which are exactly reproduced by DCC along with every other graphic and sonic detail, in their beautiful transfers issued in the mid 1990s). The question for anyone who is already a fan is, Do we need the third or fourth (fifth counting DCC's gold discs) reissues of the Creedence catalog? Well, perhaps not, unless you're as obsessive compulsive as I am. The bait here is the bonus cuts, and I must say the studio stuff is really only for completists - nothing left in the can for the past thirty or forty years is in any way revelatory, nor is there even a nice b-side ('Call It Pretending', which is interesting, has already been appended to the debut on the aforementioned boxed set). There are some nice live versions that have not been issued. As for these master transfers (George Horn) they in fact are superior to the ones issued earlier this decade - more powereful overall, and details jump out like the percussion on 'Born On The Bayou.' Fogerty's guitars sting. And his piano, always mixed to be felt not heard, is another detail in what are afterall unparalelled original mixes. One may note the 2000-01 transfers of this and other CCR albums are somwhat shorter in length than bothe these new editions and the Steve Hoffman transfers for DCC. Thant's because of the digital devotee's horror of leaving in information from the original master tape that might be misinterpreted as \\"bad\\" or wrong; dare we lead the younger or less informed consumer to perceive any amount of audible tape hiss as a 'flaw' in the mastering process (usually audible during the fade near the end of a track, as it rightly should be as it's right there on the original analog master) as if discovering that some uncouth Great Dane relieved himself right there on the front stoop.   DCC reproduced the original masters faithfully, and George Horn does it here,though these new discs are sometimes a little bright for my taste and perhaps the overall ambience Fogerty worked to achieve. But at least 'Born On The Bayou' is 5:15 and not 5:10. And one can just bask in the details and the earth tones of these performances. The debut is a good one, but \\"Bayou Country\\" is the first undeniable classic from Creedence, invoking Sun Records, Howlin Wolf, Little Richard, and Mark Twain within a seamless and wonderously executed vision that is now Fogerty's own.

B000002AZ8|4.0|This sounds like their true last attempt at a masterwork, before filler-based attributes robbed the group of completely compelling spins. Even here PJ can feel a little strained in experimental interludes, but feels utterly balanced between earnest anthems and gritty rockers.

0451196716|4.0|If you like King but find tedious spending long hours getting through his 800+ page titles, this short, quite enjoyable and dark tale is for you. I think this could obviously have been a \\"long\\" short story (if the guys would have been running instead of walking ;)), but King found a way to keep the story longer while interesting from the beginning to the end.    The plot ? simple, but efficient : in a walking contest set in a totalitarian future, 100 teenage boys must walk at a speed over 4 mph, if not they receive up to 3 warnings before...well you'll see. Most of the story is set around Ray Garraty and a dozen other walkers, mainly those walking close to him during different parts of the trip South from Main to Mass. where the walk usually ends.     King gives a lot of importance to the diminishing endurance of the walkers and their mental and physical battle to survive longer. And he does it well. The tale is dramatic and gives shivers.     A different King, short, dark and enjoyable, maybe not before sleeping...
B0001CLGFK|5.0|Great movie, came fast and arrived in great condtion. Strange film, as expected. Completely pleased.
B001FB55MG|1.0|I have never really cared enough to write a review, but this movie was so terrible, I decided to actually go out of my way and do so. The concept of Bedtime Stories was pretty original, but the execution was so predictable and awkward that it pains me to know that I paid money and spent 1 1/2 hours of my life which I will never get back.    The only bright spot in this movie was Russell Brand, but even he could not save this movie from itself. If you're an Adam Sandler fan, your time would be much better spent watching pretty much any other movie of his other than this one (even Little Nicky or Mr Deeds).
0061673730|5.0|The home truth as home-run: if ever a homily returned to roost on the shoulder it must be the closing remark in Zen and the Art of Mototorcycle Maintainance that;'Trials never end of course. Unhappiness and misfortune are bound to occur as long as people live but there is a feeling now that was not here before, and it is not just on the surface of things, but penetrates all the way through: we've won. It's going to be better now'. The relief of those last few pages proves all too brief.  Whew! Reading a post-script in an early 90s reprint of his 70s classic, we find his son, Chris(the 'we' alluded  to above) stabbed to death in L.A for the sake of a few lousy bucks. Such a senseless and casual death by unknown assailants! Now that indifference rails against the overriding healing of the book's preceeding 400 pages.  That such news could disarm me, late news at that, of someone I'd met only in print, reflects Pirsig's power to make real his plight. And if you didn't find it in the 70s you might, as I did, find its reverberations have currency. A re-reading has the doubling impact of reclaiming a younger self, echoing the retracing Pirsig is doing in his text. It's a remarkable book for more reasons than I care to note here. A brief synopsis tells that Pirsig, attempting to understand himself, raids the premises of contemporary thinking. He finds himself in Pre-Socratic times. His clear and elegant prose dissects some gristly philosophy. This prose is the aesthetic response or appeal to the problem of present thinking and the journey we've assumed as pillions with Pirsig and son. To maintain suspense in this pseudo travel-journey there's a parallel story of Pirsig recouping his ghost self from shock therapy. The impulse for this arrives from the disengagement sensed between Chris and himself. The eleven year-old's moody abstuseness has been diagnosed as the early rumblings of mental disease. They're on vacation, biking from Montana to the Pacific Ocean. The process recovers old stomping grounds and resucitates glimpses of Pirsig's former self. The analogy to bike maintenance(the real bike work is that you apply to self discovery) reveals facets of both his selves. And the reconciling of these selves verges periously close to its very opposite: a permanent rift.  As Pirsig spirals back to the Greeks he strikes the dichotomies between classic and romantic attitudes, hip and square, science and aesthetcs, rhetoric and dialect. Concern for these dualities, as old as Western thinking, encouraged the cult status of the book, especially endearing itself to art campuses in the 70s, wherever such issues were debated. And how to perceive it...with caring, for which vigilance is the prime requisite. Pirsig offers his homespun system of gumptionology: steps not to lose sensitivity.   So Pirsig revived the art rhetoric in pop culture and the art cognescenti embraced his Zen because it lauded the aesthetic life. Rhetoric is our proper form of display, our fantasy-filled capacity to live out our synptoms and pathologies through letter-writing, painting, yarnspinning, singing, movie-making and the rest. His absorption absorbs us through the depressive lows which precede compassion. I'd rate this probing internalizing on a par with the revelations of Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov.
B0026GBIB6|5.0|While I'm not surprise that some fans have negative response to SOTU, these same fans who say the Violator is a bad album the moment they first heard it. Let's move on and don't be stuck in the 80's/90's.  That's why DM is still strong and relevant in today music world. They know how to reinvent their music. Every CD is different from the previous one and they always good. You don't want them to create the same music over and over again. I like this album, totally different DM, matured but  very refreshing. Having said that, \\"Wrong\\" is the obvious choice for the first single, Peace, Little Soul, Corrupt and Jezebel are my stand out favorite. My other instant fave are Ghost, Oh Well and Light from the Box Set which I don't have a copy.    this Sound is some great reward for the masses. PEACE!!!
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder is unarguably a musical genius, and this album came out during his most fruitful period--the 1970s, in this case 1979.  The album contains some songs that have entered into the realm of enduring classics (Duke Street being one) that people will listen to decades from now. The Stevie Wonder sound cannot really be duplicated--it is unique to him; all anyone can do is simply sit back and enjoy it.
1433502437|5.0|I had seen the bible before ordering it, although not in the calfskin version that I ordered. It is truly the best study bible I have seen or used, and it would be difficult to improve upon. The sheer quantity of its content makes it quite large, despite the use of the best thin bible paper in its printing. It was also quite a technical feat to print and bind its nearly 3,000 pages while retaining the degree of flexibility it offers.    I quickly discovered that mine had arrived with a block of 64 pages missing from Psalms (the flaw). However, a simple phone call to Crossway brought a replacement quickly. They even let me retain the defective copy while I transferred notes and underlining already entered in it to the replacement copy. At this point I have only had 2 weeks with it, but it would be difficult for me to think of anything that could be added to improve upon it.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|Its one of the most interesting videos about the war that I have seen yet. It was also very educational. I would recommend to anyone who is interested in world war 2
B00081912E|5.0|I am only halfway through and I already love it. My favorite part is where Stanley puts the Mask on for the 1st time. You can buy a replica of the mask on eBay for a decent price. I am at the part where the cops are investigating Stanley's apartment after he stole all that money and his pajamas were torn. The girl said that his tie is like a Rorschach inkblot test (not to be confused with the Watchmen character). My 3 favorite masks are as follows. 3: Joker Bank Robber, 2: Rorschach, 1: The Mask. I recomend this movie.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This was not perfect but I loved it! It was great fun! I loved the way it was funny one minute and very dramatic, romantic and touching the next. I loved the acting. I can't get enough of Austen and this was very satisfying. I wish it was longer!
0765350386|4.0|Takes a little while to warm up, but once it gets rolling it is hard to put down.  The Steel Inquisitors are some of the most creepy henchmen put on a page.  The author did a great job describing these mini bosses.  It was like the Shrike from Hyperion and the eye-hand creature in Pan's Labyrinth gave birth to the Inquisitors.  It lost a star for being a bit too drawn out for my tastes.  Too much time is devoted to meetings, plotting, and scheming to the point where some chapters fail to move the story along.  Many fantasy readers will love that level of detail, so it might not be a bad thing for some, but it was for me.  Still, it's worth a try.  Another bonus is that the trilogy is complete...unlike the ones I'm still waiting on (Ice and Fire, Kingkiller series).
074322454X|5.0|Great story, a must read for wwII fans. Also, if you saw the series on TV the book compiments the saga.
B000EQ5SR0|4.0|I love Sci-Fi movies and I also have a deep appreciation for women. Many movies that feature female heroines portray them in a way that de-feminizes, particularly some Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Adventure films. This is one of many reasons why the movie \\"Tomb Raider\\" is not a part of my collection.<br /><br />Please do not be mistaken! Their is a huge difference between sexuality and femininity. The heroine that exudes FEMININITY will by default exude SEXUALITY. However, many movie heroines are very sexy to look at but are not very feminine in their character portrayal.<br /><br />I am a man that thinks women are neat, with all their complexities. I appreciate their FEMININITY and their STRENGTH. This movie was very well directed. In that, it accentuated a strong heroine who was very comfortable with being a woman. It appealed to my deep love of Sci-Fi films and my appreciation for the \\"complete woman.\\"
B000021Y7X|5.0|OMG! I waited for this to be released on Netflix forever and don't regret a day of waiting! Yes I heard Talking Heads during their hayday. No, I really didn't start to \\"get it\\" until recent years. This DVD is just phenomenol, though, and makes me grieve the years I wasn't a fan!  I was ready to call it a night last night and decided to curl up on the couch w/ this flick instead. Well, it turned out to be a crazy dance party for one! It was impossible to watch and listen without trying out all of David Byrne's great moves! I sang and whirled and screamed out accolades for great filming, harmonies, lighting and effects... It was absolutely breathtaking stuff from every angle. I have to purchase this now and it will become my most loved \\"dance video\\".

0316017922|4.0|\\"Talent is the desire to practice\\", Gladwell states. And, in reference to the Beatles, he says that their talent \\"consisted of their ability to see Hamburg, Germany as an opportunity\\". In Hamburg they had to play 8-hour sets 7 days a week.<br /><br />I agree that a desire to practice and excel are important factors in success, but a genetic predisposition to the particular skill is also important, and Gladwell seems to minimize the role of genetics.<br /><br />For example, I could never have become a great classical guitar player no matter how long and hard I practiced. I've tried playing musical instruments and it is not my thing. Most people could never become good brain surgeons or writers of novels or poetry.<br /><br />More and more, scientists are learning that genes have a greater role in who we are than was believed in the past. It is important for people to learn what, if anything, they are particularly good at, and focus on that. But, in addition to that predisposition, they also need a predisposition, or at least a capability, to work hard at that particular thing. And I believe that that predisposition to work hard at and excel at something is also genetic.<br /><br />The things he emphasizes such as culture, attitude, and opportunity are important too, and genetics alone would never make someone excel. So he is right in that regard, IMO. But these are secondary to genetic predispostion.<br /><br />It could be though that there are some activities where extensive practice can lead to world-class excelling. Maybe mundane things like gardening, or housepainting, etc. But for the higher level activities (e.g., brain surgery, classical piano, writng books or poetry, nuclear physics, etc.), to become WORLD-CLASS and renowned at them, IMO takes a genetic predisposition, in addition to the hard work, culture, conducive environment and life experiences, opportunity, and a little luck.
B0000257O9|5.0|Despite this album's reputation of being an 80's period piece, and, as everyone is probably aware of, their song Video Killed the Radio Star was the first video broadcast on MTV, this is an immensely catchy, tuneful, undated, surprisingly complex album.  Despite it being identified as \\"80's\\", it still sounds excellent and quite contemporary.  I didn't listen to this album when it came out, but when I finally got around to getting it, I found it absolutely charming and wonderful.<br /><br />The first two songs, Living in the Plastic Age and the deservedly classic Video Killed the Radio Star, set the tone.  They are electronic pop gems.  The synthesizers and computers never overpower Trevor Horn's wonderful vocals, and Geoffrey Downes's musicianship.  The lyrics are quite literate and intelligent (especially on Video), and you never think MTV or 80's when you hear this album.  I've actually never watched the entire video for Video Killed the Radio Star for the record.  Maybe I like the song too much and don't want it ruined.  This album has almost a prog rock vibe to it, dare I say.  It isn't surprising that Downes and Horn went on to join Yes shortly after this album on their unjustly trashed, much maligned album Drama (Drama is excellent).  The only other band that comes to mind that tried this intelligent computer pop/prog rock was Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson with Tull's Under Wraps and Anderson's hard to find but excellent CD/album Walk Into Light.  Mike Oldfield's Five Miles Out also falls into this category.<br /><br />Maybe The Age of Plastic is the missing link between prog rock and electronica.  Go ahead, call me pretentious.  Regardless of my possibly pretentious machinations, this is still an excellent CD/album.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I have a hard time taking any review seriously that was written in the first 24 hours after the CD was released. How many times does a person (with a reasonable intellect) have a strong reaction to a new album, either positive or negative, only to find over a few weeks, months, years that their reaction is the opposite. I have listened to many releases for the 1st time thinking \\"wow, this is really spiffy\\" only to find by the third listen that there was not so much substance behind the flash. And the reverse holds very true as well.  Please take little time before laying on the gushing praise or the bottomless vitriol. And please, for the love of god, stop thinking that you know what the artist should be doing, who should be the producer and even who should be in the band. Does anyone really think that if Vince Clarke came back into the fold that it would be a good thing rather than a clash of egos?   For the record, after a few listens, I think this is as good as album as we could have reasonably expected from DM in 2009.   I like it, a lot in fact. It's easily their best since Playing The Angel.
B00005A0V0|3.0|Low points:    The drumming;  it's flat and conventional. It really drags the songs down    The guitar work;  only interesting in \\"winter wine\\", otherwise, it's trite and unnecessary throughout the album    The lead singer;  sometimes displays a low deep and rich voice. Overall, it sounds inhibited.  The second singer;  is R Wyatt's impersonation...hmm.    The organ;  Soli all over the place, especially in the last track (it would have been nicer if each instrument had pulled off a solo in turns. But here, that's Dave Sinclair everywhere. I can see why he decided to leave Caravan after this album to play simpler, more matter-of-fact tunes (O caroline, signed curtain...) on the first Matching Mole record.        >>>>Overall sound: too cold and lacking the excitement of-say- Soft machine's first two records      Having said that, ITLOTGAP should have been a fantastic record, and one that I particularly like for it showcases great compositions and great melodies.  But there are too many things that mar this album and take the mark to a 3/3,5... On this one, I really have a big problem with the playing
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Fabulous.  What an artist.  Wish I were there, but this is all the goodies minus the rain.      I've been a fan since the 60s.  Why \\"Please Don't Pass Me By,\\" one of the greatest social commentary songs of all time, didn't make it to any of the \\"best of\\" albums I'll never understand.     Kathleen
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This album is wonderful. I was a little worried that it may not go over well with me, due to the fact that I cared very little for The Look of Love. However I took a liking to it from track 1. They could have left off You Are My Thrill and Este Seu Olhar. However So Nice and How Can You Mend A Broken Heart are my favorites. Simply put, Diana is amazing.
B001UE276A|5.0|In my review of the single disc edition I said that this is the best album that a fan could reasonably hope for from DM in 2009.  That said, the deluxe edition is beyond what any fan could have reasonably hoped for.   Pricey? Yes.   Worth it? Absolutely.  The extra CDs are great, my complaint against the 2 disc catalog reissues was that I could not readily listen to the bonus tracks in my car, so having the extras on CD here is nice. The demo disc is quite nice too, more demos are apparently forthcoming.  The DVD extras are all top notch. It is refreshing to see the lads enjoying themselves so much in the studio live tracks.  The books are beautiful (I must admit, I had some real concerns about them when this was announced...no more)   The other bits are nice, very reminiscent of the \\"A Question Of Lust\\" cassingle special edition I bought over 20 years ago.  If you are a fan, get this now, before you kick yourself when they've gone really pricey.
B001DMJ9VA|5.0|Since I am a fan of Rod Stewart, it may not be quite fair to throw accolades. However, there continues to be a need for serious music in the world, and going into the future I think that this collection of music contributes to the edification and stability of our youth.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|I really like Brendan Frasier and that's what attracted me to this film.  While I do enjoy his humor, in a nutshell it was sort of a yawner for me.  I'm glad I watched it but it's not a movie I'd recomment to anyone over say 17.
0425223523|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this story. It did not keep the same tone of the real Persuasion story by Jane Austen. Capt. Wentworth was not the same person nor was Anne. But I did like the concept of telling the story from the beginning how Capt. Wentworth and Anne first met and then going into the story of Persuasion. Overall, not what I excepted and the writing felt too elementary. Not worth spending money. Check it out from the library instead for it is good for one time reading only.
0880796863|3.0|As previous reviewers have stated, the cards are beautifully descriptive, easy to interpret, etc.    However I was expecting a normal size book, the size of a paperback.  This is the size of the cards and so tightly bound with tiny print that I was shocked!  Why would they even bother including it???    Not giving up I tried to find information on specific cards and it is impossible without scanning every page.  Shame on somebody for killing the trees to make this useless book!
B001E7OO2I|4.0|This album has some nice songs , for those who enjoy slow jams \\"Good Morning\\" and \\"Quickly\\" are good examples. I have to admit he gets confused into what genre he is in. Some songs like \\"Everybody knows\\", \\"no other time\\", and \\"this time\\" I feel don't quite fit. Then there is the Trevor Horn (producer) influence in the last two tracks which sound like a Seal album. However if you like a mix of soul slash rnb slash 90's dance track. Then its for you.

0425200450|4.0|This terrific mystery novel from 1934 defines the whodunit genre.  For me, Christie builds on Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels by introducing the culture and mores of the twentieth century, including nagging doubts about our own ability to discern right from wrong.  Although one knows that Poirot, like Holmes, will crack the case, Poirot's flaws (vanity, unimposing stature, and lack of power to bring anyone to real justice) introduce some dramatic suspense.  In addition, Christie uses the genre to explore the culture, manners, class tensions, and national rivalries of the day.      The twist of this whodunit is remarkably clever and ties in well with some of the disillusionment of twentieth century man with the ability to tell right from wrong and with the limits of rationality.  There is a wonderful irony to all this given Poirot's Holmes-like belief in reason.     The novel is dated but reads very well.  Great fun as well as containing literary merit.
B001CWOCV8|5.0|I had been waiting a long time for Lionel Richie to put out a concert DVD. I saw him in concert in Albuquerque a few years ago and he put on one of the best concerts I had ever seen. I purchased the Lionel Richie Paris Blue Ray DVD and enjoyed it very much.  Lionel is an awsome entertainer and has a way of engaging his audience in every concert. His songs brought back a lot of great memories.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|The 60's started here. Popular music never heard anything like it, and it very likely never will again. The Beatles had to play catch up after and they did with \\"Revolver\\" but they never did catch ol' Bob again.

159102594X|5.0|The Blade Itself and its following two novels are among the best fantasy literature I have read.  This is true character-based fantasy.  The storyline is not overly complex but the characters and their development through the series are what makes this work shine.  Your main characters include a self-loathing, schizophrenic barbarian who occasionally goes beserk killing everyone and everything in sight, a self-loathing but avaricious crippled torturer, a narcissistic but cowardly noble swordsman, a megalomaniacal mage and an obsessive-compulsive amazon woman.  And they are all despicable.  There is really no protagonist in this series - just a group of twisted people who hate themselves and each other, muddling through to satisfy their own ends which are entirely unfathomable until the end of the series.  Even the ancillary characters are all protrayed with incredible depth and believable human foibles.  The interactions and dialogue are witty and utterly believable.  I can usually ferret out some internal inconsistencies in a work of this length and be distracted by them - not here.  There are no stereotypes.  No do-gooders and do-badders - just different screwed up characters with their own agendas.  Every part of this series screams of originality.  I can't say that I found any part of all three books to be even momentarily tedious - the pace felt perfect.  I will be pre-ordering anything that Abercrombie puts out from here on.  I think he set a new standard and I can't wait to see what else he can come up with.
B001RTP48G|2.0|I love the Pet Shop Boys, so this review is a hard one for me to write. But after listening to the new album I have concluded that the Pets have made a serious misstep with Yes...it is passionless and mediocre.  In their quest to remain relevant, they have enlisted a production team (\\"hit-makers\\" Xenomania) that has hindered, and in some cases completely buried, the energy and essence traditionally found in Pet Shop Boys songs.   There are too many songs that are almost indistinguishable from one another and for this I lay blame solely on the Boys.  They teamed up with Xenomania and even co-wrote many of the songs with them.  Bad idea. Neil even admitted that the songwriting process with them was strange and that he and Chris were both intimidated.  Ultimately, he said he thought this process worked. I adamantly disagree (and I believe he will probably be reevaluating the results of their collaboration as the reviews start coming in).  I contend that Xenomania's influence was detrimental to the overall quality of the album as there are many songs that Neil and Chris would have NEVER put out if it was up to them alone. Where are the surging highs and melancholy lows that we are so used to? (Maybe someone should have woken Chris up?)  But seriously, why put out an album that almost never wavers from the same monochromatic tone?  I'm frustrated as I know the boys are much more capable songwriters than this pedestrian offering.     Also, Neil's lyrics (usually a highlight for me) are pretentious and awkward.  We all know he likes to write about obscure historical references and he uses non-traditional words at times, and generally he pulls it off flawlessly.  But on \\"Yes\\" the lyrics seemed forced instead of clever, repetitive instead of meaningful. (And apparently listening to the line...\\"We're building a wall, a fine wall\\" over and over again can really grate on one's nerves).  Personally, I am very disappointed.  I love the Pets and the last album was consistently good throughout.  But I am not one of those fans that will give them a glowing review merely because they put an album out.   So, back to the drawing board Boys!  I look forward to the next album (if there is a next album) as I don't think \\"Yes\\" will be seeing any serious rotation in my listening schedule.
B000CRKW9A|5.0|My last contact with this film was while stationed at NS Subic Bay in 1992.  It's story and delivery has haunted me ever since.  An extremely hard to find film, I found it here and have watched it and rewatched it several times since it arrived.  It shows a slice of life that is hard to watch or understand unless the viewer has practical experience in the raw world or posseses a very open mind.  NOT for children!

1416955070|4.0|Up front, I read C.C.'s work in the HP fandom, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Curious, I bought CoB a couple of years ago and attempted to read it, but couldn't make it past the first 150 pages or so.  I recently picked it back and up and literally read it in less than 24 hours.  You might say this is the mark of a poorly written book, but I did the same thing with Atonement, so say what you will.    I feel the need to defend this book, as it's been raked over the coals in most of the reviews I've read.  Yes, plot points are similar to other well known fantasy/sci fi works - but really, I can't remember the last time I read a truly original novel of any genre.  I did notice the occasionally overdone physical descriptions and that did annoy me a bit.  However, as a whole I really enjoyed this book.    I enjoyed the characters, though oddly enough I didn't love Magnus, as most people do.  I love Jace - but I'm a sucker for a snarky blonde, even if he is reminiscent of Spike.  I've seen many people discuss how 15/16 year olds don't talk like that, but haven't we been complaining about that since Dawson's Creek?  And actually, some of my friends in High School did talk like that, we were all pretty big word geeks though.    The plot was interesting, and certainly kept me hooked the second time around.  I found the Jace/Valentine dynamic to be interesting and look forward to seeing that explored further in the later novels.      As for the romance, while I actually didn't see the twist coming, I had enjoyed the romance up until then.  Although it was very quickly developed, it seemed obvious from the start that Jace and Clary were drawn to each other somehow, and I could feel the tension through out the novel.    All in all, I did end up enjoying the book, I'm reading City of Ashes now, and have ordered City of Glass.  It's really hard to find good, young adult fantasy, as most of it is just Gossip Girl with vampires, but I feel that CoB falls well into that category.  As Isaid, at least it was better than Twilight...
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Besides being elemental to the powerful impact of the film, this is a gripping soundtrack on its own.  I continue to listen to it to get pumped up at the gym.  Obviously I'm more in favor of the Zimmerman tracks because of their neo-industrial sound, but that's just a personal preference.  It's a great sound track to a great movie and it as engaging on it's own as it is when heard in the film.
B001608QVS|5.0|I don't usually buy TV shows or movies. Count the Dirty Harry Ultimate set as \\"had to have.\\" Keep in mind, I'm an Eastwood freak, but this set is worth every penny it cost.

0393061310|1.0|I'll make this short. Pure dreck. As an academic myself, I suspect that this book was written as a dare to see if he could get away with writing a book on a field outside of his topic of expertise without any actual data to support an incoherent set of bold hypotheses.     Well, looks like he won his dare. I wonder what this means for the state of civilization.     Anyway. Book is deeply dishonest, intellectually speaking.     It is cheap, though.

031606792X|5.0|Having read the critics venom filled reviews and the many layman loathing reviews, I can only scratch my head and ask myself \\"what did they want to happen?\\"  I'm no kid; in fact my granddaughter introduced me to the first two books.  She wanted the third and fourth.  I thought it would be prudent to see why all her interest in them.  I breezed through the first two completely enamored with all three main characters actually feeling very sorry for poor Jake.  My interest peaked enough for me to read the 264 pages of Midnight Sun now posted on the internet by the author, as I felt that I wanted to know what was going on in Edward's brain and then I understood it all.    Bella, square peg in a round hole world; Edward, the only square hole to fit her.  Jake, a square hole with rounded corners, enough to give Bella a suggestion of happiness, but not enough to comsume her.  It was all so clear.  So, I purchased the last two books, but before handing them off to said granddaughter, I read them.    So, you thought that this had to continue with more danger to everyone or that no way Bella would ever become an immortal?  That she would remain in Edward's life forever human.  Please, she was stronger than he was emotionally from the beginning, stronger than all of them put together emotionally.  What she lacked in grace she made up for in stubborness and directness.  There was always going to be a baby of some sort.  Book three lead to that notion with Rosalie's confession to Bella.  It was inevitable.  So why did that shock anyone?  No, everything that happened to this pair in the Breaking Dawn was predertermined in all that Meyers wrote in the first three.  It had to be this way.  Bella coming into her own as a protector of all.  And finally a reason Bella couldn't break free of her emotions for Jake.  Because they were tied together by a thread no one could see.  And Edward's realization that all things happen for a reason in Edward's words to Jake \\"...goodbye my brother...my son.\\"    So for those of you who were disappointed, I'm sorry.  I thought it was exactly what needed to happen.  And it still doesn't end the story.  There is still so much more that could be told and perhaps, with luck, will be told.

1596680180|2.0|[[ASIN:0952322501 Creative Kumihimo]]<br /><br />I bought this book several years ago and every braid has a color picture AND 2 braiding diagrams.<br /><br />It has circular braiding for the Maru Dai and square paper braiding.<br /><br />A page will have a number and letter to match the color plates of the braids to the page.<br /><br />Then there is a brick style diagram for how to braid.<br /><br />Then there is a circular set of diagrams.<br /><br />There is also an additional black and white photo at top center of the page to show the proper braid position from above, looking down through the Maru Dai.<br /><br />There is some history and diagrams for setting up the Maru Dai.<br /><br />********************************<br /><br />I'm cheap, I used a styrofoam circle (the kind they sell for floral wreaths) and 4 pencils for the legs (to mark the 1/2 way point between the 4 directions). Then I used fishing weights to pull the braids evenly through the circle. For bobbins, I used old, metal, sewing machine bobbins and put the thread on just as you would on a Japanese bobbin. Now I use thread spools. The kind that Maderia rayon thread that has a snap top to keep it from unwinding. This is MUCH cheaper than the Japanese equipment but not as impressive.<br /><br />I've made some of each kind of braid and had NO problems completing them using only this book.<br /><br />********************************<br /><br />Since I can't see inside this book, there is a chance that this book may be a new title for the old book.<br /><br />The ISBN's are different, so I put the title of the book + ISBN as the title of my review.<br /><br />********************************<br /><br />There is another book:<br /><br />Title ...

Interweave Press<br /><br />Date of Pub ... 1995<br /><br />ISBN ... 1883010063<br /><br />Why this book as well?<br /><br />This one has real plans you can copy to make your own circular or square braiding equipment. It has patterns for bobbins as well.<br /><br />No, it is not exactly like the Japanese ones, but it is wood and will work just as well. It has very good diagrams.<br /><br />This book also has a conversion chart between Grams and Momme.<br /><br />A lot of construction of the Japanese kind has religious and other special symbolism, that would be completely devoid of meaning to most Americans.<br /><br />The pages in this book have the braid number at top center with the name of the braid below it.<br /><br />Then the page is divided into 2 parts. The left side has Square Card with the positions of the parts of the braid on it AND a color photo of the braid the pattern will make.<br /><br />On the right side are circular AND square diagrams for the braid.<br /><br />I find this book harder to follow, but the attention to detail, helps when the pattern is confusing.<br /><br />This book has several full page color plates of braided jewelry.  A smaller example is on page 17. \\"A 14th century Chuzon-ji, another ancient temple braid from Japan. This braid can be made with either 72 or 144 bobbins.\\"<br /><br />It's really beautiful. There is NO pattern for this. It is used to explain the history of braiding in Japan.<br /><br />These are the 2 books that I suggest are the best available for Americans who like to braid.  Neither is for a child. It is for teens and adults. A child, but could make the easier braids with help of an adult.<br /><br />If you are looking for the best books regardless of cost, time needed to learn, etc. Then I suggest (assuming you can find them):<br /><br />\\"Exquisite: The World of Japanese Kumihimo Braiding\\", Sahashi Kei (editor), pub by Kodansha, London UK 1979<br /><br />\\"The Works of Tamaki Hirata vol. 1\\", by Tamaki Hirata, Tokyo, Japan 1985<br /><br />\\"The Works of Tamaki Hirata vol. 2\\", by Tamaki Hirata, Tokyo, Japan 1990<br /><br />I, of course, haven't had the pleasure of seeing these books. I suggested them to you, per a friends advice. His advise has never been bad.<br /><br />**************<br /><br />I took the time to write this, so those who want advanced books can get some advice.

B00275EGX8|4.0|This is a very particular and full of personality film about an american  group that disarms bombs in the desert wars. The film is tense, hard, dry like the sand. In the most part of it you watch the group in action, even when there is not much action, but there is tension always ! The actors and the great director (K-19, Strange Days)  made a good job, transmiting a real feeling as you were there, questioning yourself about the stupidit of any kind of violence against people. Very well done tecnically and a with a great video quality, considering what DVD can delivers to you. In Blu-ray I think it will be fantastic !!! And to be honest ... the industry could stop to make DVD. Let's Blu-ray !!! Now !!!<br />******<br />OBS: I am including an observation in this review today (01/17/2010)... I don't care if The Hurt Locker will win anything in Oscar or something like this ... Is it better than Avatar? Come on! Avatar is just and only visual effects with bad acting, weak direction, superficial emotions ... The Hurt Locker deserves our admiration because it's a great film and just not a product like Avatar, Star Trek, Twilight, etc...

0393061310|5.0|In his critical review of Guns, Germs and Steel, Christopher Smith's core point is clearly legitimate: The handful of factors Diamond centers on here - environmental, in one way or another - aren't fully explicative of all of human history. The changes and shifts of technology (beyond the very basic ones he mentions) are crucial too, along with patterns of human thought and even some specific individual action. (The books listing 100 influential people in world history, for example, focus to a considerable degree on religious, philosophical and scientific innovators as major levers in human history.)<br /><br />But if Guns, Germs overreaches somewhat, it still isolates and highlights such useful trendlines for the sweep of human history that is more than just useful - it can be mind-altering. A lot of human history has been a growth from what has come before, and some groups of people and certain places have had advantages others haven't. The reasons behind that do come back, surprisingly often, to the factors Diamond cites.<br /><br />One of the best pieces of evidence for this is Diamond's successor book, Collapse, which is about societies around the world (mainly but not exclusively isolated from others). Collapse isn't as sweeping or compelling, but its case studies provide an ample set of backdrop evidence for supporting many of Guns' core ideas.<br /><br />Not a be-all, but a fine place to consider the sweep of human development.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Penelope Cruz might have won the Oscar for her brief but explosive performance, but it's Rebecca Hall that dominates this film.  Having seen it, I'm stunned more people aren't talking about her performance.  It is nothing less than brilliant, shaded with complex nuances and emotions right down to the last fade-out scene with the anguished look on her face as she walks away from her what-might-have-been with Javier Bardem's character.  Of course, the excellence of her performance is thrown into greater relief by the near-in comparison with Scarlett Johansson.  Woody Allen is obviously smitten; many of the rest of us...not so much.<br /><br />I'm not a great fan of Allen, but he's in top form here.  I especially loved the way that the initial presence of Bardem hovered off-screen while the female characters whispered excitedly and furtively about him.  You think:  this guy better be something else.  When he's first shown -  wordlessly - my wife gasped.<br /><br />The same with Allen's direction of Cruz's appearance:  45 minutes into a move clocked in at a tidy 1 hour 38 minutes, the divine Ms. P had yet to make an appearance.  I thought to myself \\"Wow, she must come into this film like a ball of fire.\\"  Indeed.  For those of us used to Cruz' knockout performances in her native tongue (see Pedro Almod&oacute;var's [[ASIN:B000N3T0DW Volver]] foremost), it's wonderful to see her ability on display in an English language film.<br /><br />By the way, the sleeve blurb on my rented copy described Cruz' character as \\"insanely jealous\\" about her ex-husband (Bardem).  Viewers will agree: she's not insanely jealous, just flat-out insane.<br /><br />One additional observation:  parts of Christopher Evan Welch's voice-over could serve as a commercial for Spain.  The country itself is like a fifth main character in the film.

It's up to a motley crew of law enforcement, government officials, and computer crackers to stop the AI (the titular Daemon) before it takes over and implements a New World Order (version 2.0)...<br /><br />This book is very fast-paced and grips the reader early on. Whether it manages to keep this momentum is debatable. The book changes gears a few times, starting off as slick crime fiction, then slipping into a techno-thriller, with over-the-top action sequences seasoned in at strategic intervals. The ending is abrupt, and all but screams \\"sequel!\\"<br /><br />There's a heavy-handed amount of technical jargon in this which will either endear or disenfranchise the reader, depending on how much they know about the subject. Likewise, the book mixes frighteningly plausible scenarios with items that (to put it mildly) require a mega-dose of suspension of disbelief. I was having too much fun to care, but can easily see how others would be put off by it.<br /><br />This is not a book for everyone, especially luddite cyberphobes. I liked it, but can see why many readers wouldn't. Curiously, I plan on recommending it to a number of 133+ friends of mine, who I'm certain will get into it (and appreciate it) a lot more than I did.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|This album is probably going to divide some older fans of Mastodon, let's just get that out of the way right now.  Some may be dismayed at some of the changes in their sound.  That is definitely not how I feel, in fact, this is the best album of the year and their career in my opinion.  They have truly taken things to a new level and are sure to bring new fans into the fold.  This is an album that finds a band completely secure in their vision and abilities as musicians.<br /><br />They have expanded their sound by adding texture and instruments (piano, banjo) not present on previous releases and it works really well.  They have also changed up their vocals to be a bit more expressive.  All four members have stepped up their game, especially Brent Hinds.  He has always created intricate solos, however, on this disc he hits it out of the park with a depth of emotion and passion that lifts each track to the um, skye.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer mentioned, the title of the album and some of the elements of the songs are detailing the emotions Brann Dailor went through when his sister committed suicide at the age of fourteen.  The basic story of the album deals with a paralyzed boy who begins experimenting with astral projection to experience something outside of his existence.  Even if you don't care about the narrative the lyrics are well written and have a power that matches the intensity of the music.<br /><br />If you are new to this band and the album you may want to give it a few listens to let it sink in before passing judgement.  There is a lot going on here with a ton of influences and styles readily present.  There is a healthy dose of Progressive interlaced on this album for starters.  I even thought I heard a bit of Gabriel era Genesis in some of the arrangments and was confirmed of this when I read that one of Brann Dailor's favorite albums is The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.  This is especially noticeable with the arrangements on Quintessence, The Czar (I. Usurper II. Escape III. Martyr IV. Spiral) and The Last Baron.  The Czar and The Last Baron both clock in at over ten minutes in length but are so well constructed that they seem to go by in three which is a difficult accomplishment.  These three tracks along with Oblivion are stand-outs for me.<br /><br />This is by far their best sounding album.  Brendan O'Brien produced the album and he has always been one of my favorite producers over the years.  Brendan's strength has always been to let the musicians create while he concentrates on making the album sonically pristine.  I don't think anyone is going to have a problem with the production.<br /><br />So there you have it.  This is an album that moves the band forward without selling out.  It's by far my favorite album of 2009 at this point and I won't be surprised at all if ten years down the road it's viewed as one of the best Metal albums of this decade.e III. Martyr IV.

The fact that she paints these pictures through the eyes of children is AMAZING.  I wish she'd written more.  Although when you write perfection your first time out, it must be hard to contempate topping yourself.

B0013FSL0C|5.0|As a psychotherapist myself, it is rare that I see an accurate portrayal of a therapy session on television or in a movie.  'In Treatment' is that rarest of shows, a very accurate portrayal of a therapist and his patients.  The therapist (Gabriel Byrne) grapples with all types of personal issues of his own as he tries to help his patients who often struggle with similar issues.  Concerns like boundaries, limit setting, clinical supervision and acting out during session are all dealt with.<br /><br />Gabriel Byrne plays a very human and very caring therapist.  The viewer is privy to his once a week sessions with 4 different patients plus his once a week session with his own therapist.  We can see his emotional struggles as he tries to do the right thing in situations that are far from black and white.  He seeks clinical supervision but his past baggage with his clinical supervisor, Gina, (Diane Wiest) often gets in the way.<br /><br />I was riveted by this program.  You can call it a busman's holiday but I call it a fascinating show with a high interest plot and fine acting.
B001CDLATE|1.0|Really disapointing. This is the third time I bought Baraka movie! first VHS format on 96, than DVD and now Blue-ray format. I was one of the first to receive, I believe, because I have pre-ordered on Amazon. Came with problem, and I have returned, than received another copy. But same problem, in my opinion think this problem was spread out on the very first release, so better to wait a couple more months to get a better release. Don't buy now.
B001IBIQU6|2.0|I believe anybody can have a bad day. In this spirit, I think Depeche Mode deserves it more than anyone. They are icons of techno/electronica/pop/dance music since the 1980s and have proved over and over that they can produce great music.  Sounds of the Universe, however, is a weak album. I heard it over and over trying to enjoy it but never could. With some notable exceptions ('Peace', 'Perfect', perhaps 'Wrong') this collection of songs accomplishes very little. David Gahan's vocals are dull, the mood is dark and musically poor and meaningless. If you are new to Depeche Mode: Avoid. If you are an old-time fan: Grab a few tracks and expect for better in the near future (I hope).
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|Well, young man meets older woman.  She draws him a bath.  He comes back they have sex.  More nakedness and yet another bath.  She has a bath, he has a bath, they have a bath.......they waste alot of water in this movie! The first half they are both naked.      The story line is kind of slow.  While Winslet is a good actress, but,  one doesn't become great just because she wore no makeup, had greasy hair, and had hairy armpits. There is alot of silence in the movie.    After she leaves abruptly,the story just seemed odd to me.  Why would she become a prison guard in a Jewish camp?  Why then does the story turn to a trial.  Yes, the illiteracy is an issue, but it just didn't flow in my opinion.    It was an OK movie.  I certainly wouldn't buy it.
0316017922|3.0|There is no denying it, this is a fun book to read and you can probably read it in one sitting straight through. The examples the author uses to try to prove his points are appealing and easy to follow, though I have to admit that some are better than others.<br /><br />There are two big issues I had with this work though. One is that by proving that some aspects have an impact on success, the author disregards the importance of others. For example, the fact that someone is born at a certain time of the year, giving this person an advantage in sports leagues as a kid, does not mean that other factors, such as talent are not as important (or more) in explaining success. Gladwell does not come out and say that talent is not important, but he definitely hints that this is the case, or at least that it is a minor factor.<br /><br />But the second thing that bothered me is even more relevant, and has to do with the fact that the author is cherry-picking some statistics to prove his point, and in some cases presenting these in misleading terms. A clear example is when he cites the statistic that in \\"52 percent of crashes, the pilot at the time of the accident has been awake for twelve hours or more\\". I don't know about you, but this does not tell me much. In order to be able to draw any conclusions I would have to know how many flights end up with the pilot being awake for that period of time. If more than 52% of flights end (meaning with the plane landing safely) with a pilot that has been awake for more than 12 hours, then the statistic presented by the author is meaningless, and even more troubling, misleading.<br /><br />I was also a little disappointed by the way in which the different parts of the book are connected. It seems that some factors are \\"identified\\" as causes for success here and there but there is no portion of the work in which there is an attempt to understand their relative importance.<br /><br />Overall, this is an interesting read but there are some important flaws if you are looking for an authoritative work on what drive success. I believe that more serious research and a more critical analysis of the factors considered would have been required for that feat to be accomplished.looking for an authoritative work on what drive success.

1427206031|3.0|Most of us are somewhat familiar with the George Mallory story: a British climber, lost on Everest in 1924 leaving behind a controversy that may never be resolved.   Did he die on the way up or the way down?  The discovery of his body in 1999 kicked off a flurry of new interest in his story.  Paths of Glory, a novel, is based on the life of George Mallory.  Paths never claims to be factual, but the narration reads like a biography.  Starting with George's childhood, we hear about his education, his friends, his lack of fear and natural inclination to climb.  The lines between fact and fiction begin to blur somewhere around the middle of the story, where George meets his wife to be and falls madly in love.  Paths threatens to become a rather sickeningly sweet love story at this point with all his declarations of love and devotion and the charming way George and Ruth speak to one another (\\"my darling\\", \\"my love\\").  But George's story is far more than a love story; it is a story of obsession.  He cannot rest until he has given every effort to reach the summit of Everest.    While it is fairly well skimmed over, expeditions to Everest in the early 20's are epic stories themselves.  Typically 6 months long, these trips involved Atlantic crossing by steamship, lengthy walks (2 months across India) before reaching their destination and it is only then they begin to climb.  That part of the world was not well known to most Westerners, and the people largely misunderstood.   Archer glosses over most of this part of the journey, which if done well might have added 2 more cd's to this version.  What I think Archer misses in this novel is that trips to Everest are expeditions, not just \\"bracing walks\\".  While listening, I waited to feel the tension, combined with the misery of being cold and hungry that mountaineering books can elicit.  While this is a novel, and not an adventure travelogue, being taken to those heights is what makes stories about mountain climbing so gripping.According to some of Mallory's own writings, there was more depth to his character than we are presented with in this story.  Archer has painted a picture of the perfect man: polite, respectful, and loaded with character and integrity.   Adding a little realism would have made this story more believable.  And while it is fiction, it so closely shadows Mallory's biography that hints of inaccuracy jump out.   No man has ever been as perfect as Archer's Mallory.     The most interesting character is George Finch, an excellent climber of Australian birth.  While the pompous members of Britain's climbing elite cannot stomach the thought of this brash disrespectful Aussie being the first to set foot on top of the world, they are cast as villains for excluding him and possibly costing our hero his life.   Further delving into the character that was Finch would have added some much needed texture to this story.    Paths of Glory is an interesting fictionalization of a real man.  While the hero-worship went a little over the top, Mallory's story remains intriguing.  The epilogue neatly wraps up the rest of the characters.   Armchair mountaineers who have read Joe Simpson, Jon Krakauer, Heinrich Harrer, and Sidney Wignall  will be bored by this, and find Mallory to be too good to be true.   Readers and listeners less familiar with close-to-death adventure thrillers may  enjoy this immensely.   Its disappointing that so many will be left thinking they have gotten to know the real George Mallory, because I suspect there is much much more.    Those interested in the Mallory story are better served by reading [[ASIN:B001QCXF26 Last Climb: The Legendary Everest Expeditions of George Mallory]], [[ASIN:0330393790 The Ghosts of Everest: The Authorised Story of the Search for Mallory and Irvine]], [[ASIN:0684871521 The Lost Explorer: Finding Mallory on Mt. Everest]], or [[ASIN:0898868718 Detectives on Everest: The 2001 Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition]]. All provide insightinto Mallory's personality, and shed some light on the mountaineering mystery  that may never be solved.  *from Mallory's letter to his wife

B001TOD92C|5.0|All the hype you've heard that surrounded Mickey Rourke's performance in Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler should definitely be believed.  Yes, The Wrestler finds Rourke's career renaissance coming full circle as he stars as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a pro-wrestler way past his prime who is broken, beat-up, and scrounging around just to get by, while still yearning for the sounds and cheers of the crowd.  At its heart, The Wrestler is a character study that succeeds not so much because of its somewhat predictable script, but because of Aronofsky's (Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain) vision, and wholeheartedly because of Rourke's soul-bearing performance as Randy.  How Rourke didn't nail down an Oscar win I'll never know, no disrespect to Sean Penn who was spectacular himself in Milk, but Rourke is the supreme embodiment of the character he's playing, so much so that if Randy were involved in another profession, Rourke would only be playing himself.  Marisa Tomei (who herself received an Oscar nod as well) is fearless and so fine as a kindly stripper doing what she has to just to get by, and Evan Rachel Wood in a brief turn as Randy's estranged daughter makes the most out of her scenes.  But once again, it's Rourke who gives the performance of his career that makes The Wrestler as great a film that it is, and the film manages to deliver an emotional punch that has as much impact as a dropkick to the face.  All in all, The Wrestler is something you need to see, even if you aren't a fan of Aronofsky, Rourke, or professional wrestling (which you don't have to be at all to begin with), for it is something that is truly special indeed.

B001CDLAT4|5.0|Kudos to those responsible for this film/video, for not having dialogue, or a storyline - just fascinating sights from around the world, which richly includes cultural and religious customs - social evolution displayed in all it's splendour.  I especially loved the scene of the mosque or temple (not sure which) that reflected shimmering, scintillating white light from wall and ceiling - a visionary view of the conscious state of bliss?  I loved it, bought it, and show it to friends.  I'm sure you'll love it too.
B000063DIH|5.0|An oft overlooked album, yet nonetheless this is one of my favorite maiden albums, and definitely their best 90's album. Many songs may be weak, but a few are very good. The great opener Be Quick or be Dead, the deep Afraid to shoot Strangers, the dark Fear is the Key, the quick Childhood's End, and the powerful Wasting Love, after this, the tracks are weak until Judas Be My Guide, then weekend warrior, a very poor song, is followed by the epic closer; Fear of the Dark. A current concert staple. Overall, not as good as Number, Powerslave, or seventh son, but better then all the other albums.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|I saw this film for the first time in 1984, I was 20. Irrelevant of good or bad, the move left an impression. And isn't that exactly what films are intended to do? Consider the move \\"Jaws.\\" Was it a good film or a bad film? It was a bloody film that kept millions of people from swimming, anywhere! But, it did make an impression. Do you own it? Why? For posterity? Perhaps.    Movies rarely get the credit they deserve when they upset the norm and put bible-thumpers at the ready. The protestors and the holy alike will chase art and creativity out of town before the townsfolk can make a decision on their own about the quality. Remember the Exorcist? The clergy had their vestals in a bunch over that one. Because of that, the move never did make it to some towns and when it did, people were practically considered outcasts if they were recognized going in or out of the theatre.    If you watched those movies today, would you think the same about them as you did back then? Let's hope not. I recently saw this one and I had an entirely different perspective of the film, and of myslef.    This movie is a classic. Young Malcolm McDowell was somewhat still a teensy wet, er... inexperienced, but he was well on his way to bigger projects like \\"Cat People\\" and \\"Star Trek Generations: The Movie.\\" and most recently in \\"Wanted.\\" And Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, and John Gielgud. Nuff said.    It's a must for collectors or if you simply appreciate it for what it is. If you consider that it based on some fact, then love it for its history.

0375842209|5.0|When I first started reading this book I was a little skeptical about how I would like it when I found out that \\"death\\" was the narrator.  Thank goodness I kept reading.  Not only was the story moving (another point of view of Nazi Germany), but the authors chosen words throughout the book.  I know this might sound like an oxymoron of some sort, but the book was vivid in it's simplicity.  The right words were chosen each and every page to describe thoughts, feelings, and events which made them more real and more true.  A story told by a real person feeling real emotions.      By the end of the book you feel as though you really know the characters.  You can see them, you grow up with them.  You smile in their triumphs, and likewise your heart aches when they feel pain and sorrow. I can be honest in saying that this book moved me to tears.    It's not just a story about Nazi Germany, but rather a story of words and how the words affect us in each of our own ways.  Words are an important theme in this book and I highly recommend this book to anyone and recommend a box of tissue near the end too :-)

B000R7HY0K|4.0|'Stalk And Crash' might describe this half of the 2007 Grind House double bill, in which the deranged 'Stuntman Mike' (brilliantly played by Kurt Russell) targets and kills young women by running them over with his custom-built high-speed automobile.  It's as bizarre and over-the-top as the Grind House duology aimed to be, sometimes almost surreally so, and it achieves a successful blend of the horror thriller and the 'fast cars and open road' action movie.       Death Proof is told in two halves, taking place about eighteen months apart I believe, but in the first half it almost appears to be taking place in the 1970s (the decade the movie takes most of its inspiration from) despite the prescence of modern devices such as cell phones, and the film quality is scratched up and sometimes hazy, sometimes cutting out altogether, as if it's trying to achieve the look of a film reel that's been making its rounds from theater to theater from 1972 straight through to the modern day and has taken a pounding along the way.  The second half, which has a much more modern feel and a clean, well-produced look, juts out in stark contrast, as if a sequel to the original half was filmed ages later on a bigger budget.  Oddly enough, it works.  Both halves follow Russell's psychopath character as he targets different groups of girls for death on the road, but in one half it quickly becomes apparant that Stuntman Mike may have selected the wrong group of 'victims'.  Great casting all around (including one of my personal favorite actresses, Mary Elizabeth Winstead), great use of music, terrific action sequences, great dialogue, a sharp wit,and a wickedly sexy vibe during much of the movie, make this one a real winner and the strongest of the two Grind House features (although Planet Terror was pretty good too).  Biggest complaint - between both features, we still don't get all of the fake trailers that were included in the theatrical release (although at least we get 'Machete' with Danny Trejo, which should Definately be made into a full-length movie).

0780619951|4.0|The third filmed version of H.G. Wells's story (after 1932's \\"Island Of Lost Souls\\" and 1977's \\"Island Of Dr. Moreau\\") is a highly under-rated movie, that succeeds both as a part of the 'playing God' genre that (as with 'Frankenstein' and numerous more recent books and movies) looks at the idea of man reshaping both nature and himself to suit his whims; and as a riveting, at times tragic, monster-horror movie.       A plane crash  leaves a UN diplomat (played by David Thewlis) the only survivor, adrift in a lifeboat, to be rescued by a boat bound for a mysterious island off the waters of Indonesia.  Rescued and treated by the assistant (actually more like hired gun, as we're to find out shortly, and played by Val Kilmer) of the island's reclusive scientist/de facto ruler Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando), Thewlis is completely unprepared for what he finds upon coming ashore, where the doctor has created a multitude of part-human, part-animal (various species, and possibly sometimes a combination of quite a few) creatures.  The general story of the Island Of Dr. Moreau has become universally well-known over the decades through various tellings and re-tellings, and few people watching this would be surprised at the idea that things are going to soon spiral out of control.       There's a lot going on that's not specifically spelled out, though, mainly: did the spiralling out of control have to happen?  Thewlis's character may have been a catalyst in a way he never intended.       The creatures are used to life under Moreau, whose ultimate goal with his experiments is to be able to 'program out' all the human race's violence and other undesirable tendencies.  Moreau considers himself the 'father' of all the hybrids, and considers himself a benevolent one at that, but it's obvious to everyone but Moreau himself that there are hypocrisies and injustices about.  First of all, the more human a hybrid appears, the more Moreau favors him or her, and no one is more aware of this than the least human-looking of the hybrids.  His personal favorite is his 'daughter', (Fairuza Balk), who indeed is a gentle and articulate being, but one has to wonder, would Moreau (and for that matter, Thewlis's character) have responded to her in the same way if she'd been, say, furry and hunchbacked (but with the same sweet personality) as opposed to the beautiful young human woman she appears to be, whose only tell-tale signs of difference are her unique eyes?  Second, the hybrids, with the exception of a few favored ones who live in Moreau's mansion with him, have little control over their own lives - Moreau dominates them completely, and though he seems to want the best for them, isn't a benevolent dictator still a dictator?  Moreau and Kilmer control any undesirable behavior in the hybrids by using remote control devices that activate intense pain in implants within their bodies.  Since there are no external wounds, Moreau seems to think they should all forget about it, but still, some of the hybrids have suffered greatly because of these devices.  Moreau would argue that they're necessary, as some of the hybrids, particularly those bred from the DNA of carnivorous animals, occasionally show signs of giving into their more feral nature.  But still, the seeds of bitterness are planted.  It's apparant that many of the hybrids have been struggling for a long time before the movie begins - for example, one of the rules of the island is that no one eats meat, but the hybrids with a lot of, say, wolf or tiger in them, long instinctively to hunt for their own food.  They're told they're not supposed to, and are left fighting their instincts and wondering what's wrong with them to feel like this.  Meanwhile, aside from Moreau, the authority on the island lies in the hands of Kilmer's character, who's a glorified mercenary and unlikely to have gone out of his way to make life easier for the hybrids.       Then Thewlis comes to the island, the first 'outside' human the hybrids have ever seen (although many of them know that large numbers of 'normal' humans exist off the island) and, although justifiably shocked, immediately reacts to the creatures as if they're freaks and abominations. Except for Balk, who he's immediately drawn to, not even realizing at first that she's one of 'them'.  He later gains more respect for some of the creatures, but the damage may have already been done - one more reminder that the island's full-human masters, and now presumably normal humans everywhere, are always going to regard them as lesser.  And this plays into a series of events that's already been escalating for some time, where more and more of the more feral hybrids are beginning to rebel.  Added into this is that, without regular drug injections, All the hybrids, Balk included, will theoretically revert to a much more savage state.      Great special effects are a highlight of the movie, and swing into full force in the latter parts of the film, as carnage erupts and tremendous, horrifying, beast vs. beast and beast vs. human action engulfs the island with tragic results.  Great characters - both good, bad, and sort of in-between -, the aforementioned effects, a jungle setting that's both beautiful and primal, and terrific action sequences all pump the movie up.  Scary, thought-provoking, exciting and fascinating, this is highly recommended for fans of horror, action and science fiction, and for anyone interested in stories set in the increasingly relevant territory of the ethical dilemnas of genetic enmgineering and the like.  Very underappreciated movie deserving of much more respect.  Incidentally, director John Frankenheimer also directed another horror movie in this general vein, [[ASIN:B00005RDAI The Prophecy]] (1979), in which the monsters are spawned by the effects of rampant pollution rather than scientific engineering.  That's another one I wholeheartedly recommend.

When you play racing games and need these as throtle, or even FPS  games and use this buttons to shot, your finger slips and often miss.

B000QJF65E|5.0|There is no need to review a masterpiece already translated into 57 languages. You are asking me to be an intellectual snob as well as arrogant and redundant. The authorspent time in Auschwitz as a captive doctor, nearly died himself, saved a zillion other people, lost his family and came out with a hopeful way of life that he shared with the world, not as a Jew, not as a citizen of his native country, but as a lover of life.  If you knew this book, you would be reading it, not asking an ordinary person like myself to review it.    Respectfully, Goldie Kossow
0618477942|4.0|I didn't expect much from this book, cartoons and all. But what I got was a pleasant surprise. It was entertaining, informative and fun. Our writer begins at a very early age in her life and takes us through a journey of her own sexual awakening and discovery, to the discovery that her father was gay and often with men, even while married to her mother. She gives her feelings and thoughts about being raised by a man who bordered obsessive and could not, or would not, control his predilection for young men. I loved how she put the story together. It is a short read but well worth the price. And the graphics are fun. If you enjoy \\"Dykes to watch out for\\"....you will love this.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Armageddon is the masculine counterpart of the feminine Deep Impact, which emphasizes human relationships and serial sacrifices. (For that reason, I suspect that males tend to rate Armageddon highly, but females don't.) The story is well conceived and written, and the ending pays off, if a bit perfunctorily once back on earth. Steve Buscemi and Will Patton stole the movie. Willis was a tad hysterical; Affleck, a bit of fluff added as chick-bait. All in all, a satisfying evening's entertainment.
1400049628|5.0|I love this book for two reasons. First it is truly an entertaining read, one which you can tell the author put in a lot of thought.    Secondly, you can bring this book up in any social situation by using the phrase \\"you know who wouldn't act that way...Zombies.\\" You can also play zombie trivia games on how zombies would react to certain situations.    If you talk about this book as though it is a true representation of what has happened or what could happen, the looks on other people's faces are priceless.     I will definitely read more of what this author puts out. It's funny and a great read.
B000UR9T7I|5.0|I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the \\"best\\" and especially on this Blu-Ray disc, which looks spectacular. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining and not just because of the sharp transfer.  It's a fun film.<br /><br />Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc.<br /><br /> Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.<br /><br />Myself, I thought \\"The Sandman\\" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!<br /><br />This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, revenge is more fun - no doubt......but never as satisfying.<br /><br />For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.
B00005YJMX|5.0|As one would expect from Herzog, this is a version of the Dracula story that is turned upside down:  the hero is Lucy (the sister who is turned into a vampire in other versions), who understands what the count really is and seeks to destroy him all alone.  Van Helsing in this version must be dragged along to see the truth, as he is a doddering old man at the end of his career and capacities to think.  Indeed, he is a useless scientist.  The time is also earlier, pre-industrial and with echos of the Middle Ages, even though it must be the 17C.<br /><br />Kinsky is absolutely brilliant as Dracula, in one of his best performances.  Rather than the sexual magnetism that Lugosi or Oldham exuded with such charisma, he is pathetically aware that he can only prey on love and humanity, from a distance.  But he is compelled by blood lust.  Kinski really doesn't look at all human, but a true creature of the night.  Adjani was never more beautiful and depressed.<br /><br />Dracula's arrival in Germany brings a far greater evil than just himself, again portrayed as the breakdown of all order and decency.  Adjani  walks through the town center, deserted except for those accepting death as a celebration, in a stunning reflection of medieval images of plague.  They grab her, want her to dance with them, but she pursues her higher purpose.<br /><br />The most shocking part is the end, totally unexpected and ominous, yet without overt horror.  Again, perfectly done:  not hollywood slick, but projecting the horror and its power into the unknown future.  Only Herzog can do this so effectively.<br /><br />Recommended warmly.  It is poetry of horror.
0375507256|5.0|Many others have saliently outlined the premise of this novel, so I won't rehash that, but I wanted to just add my voice to chorus of praise for Mitchell's fantastic fiction. (SPOILER'S AHEAD)  The author, like Wolfe in \\"Orlando\\", spans many different time periods and does so within the constraints of that specific storyteller's head (& language).    This angle of \\"pastiche\\" I guess it's called, is remarkably effective in how you read the story--(aside from all the more obvious things that make this a great story).   But even with this dazzling, technical-storytelling ability, the philosophical underpinnings of it all (e.g. human nature/the magical realism of a soul reborn) are probably what stick with me the most after finishing.   Somehow I also kept thinking of Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs & Steel\\" while I read this, and I'm sure Mitchell had to have read it.     Bravo to Mr. Mitchell, this book deserves all the praise it gets.
B000P13RVS|4.0|I was hesitant to read this - I'm not big on these kind of books. In the end, a friend recommended it, and I'm glad I read it.<br /><br />It gave me some great ideas on how to think about taxes, and money management in general. I'm already a go-getter, but I lacked some basic the tax and basic accounting knowledge. This book helped there.<br /><br />Who knew serious wealth could come from 4 little numbers: 1031. Enjoy.

B001DY45DA|3.0|The merits of Krauss's 1953 performance of the Ring Cycle are well-known: transparency, unsentimentality, and an ability to get out of the way of the singers -- most notably a superb Hans Hotter and Astrid Varnay, along with a quite young Regina Resnik.<br /><br />Rodolphe's recording, however, attempts to save space and money by recording one mono track on each of the two stereo channels per disk. They provide a \\"splitting\\" device which sits between the CD player and the amplifier which will allow you to switch between the channels. This is unacceptable, given the vagaries of the stereo cabinet, and using the balance knob to listen to one channel or the other is an equally poor solution. The set is unlistenable otherwise, and there is no reason to go through these contortions when the 1956 Bayreuth recording is available on this site from $40-$60.

Tried it in different players, as well as my PC with no success.  It made my Windows Media Player crash.  I thought although it's new, maybe it has something on the back causing it to stick.  When we tilted it to the light, there are tons of little circle blemishes all over it.  Too late to return.  Please view your movies within the return date.

B0025X5WSU|4.0|Rhys Meyers is of course a crazy choice for Henry VIII. I suppose he's better than Shaq O'Neal or Danny DeVito would have been, but not much. Having said that let me restrict my self to the Amazon VOD HD presentation.<br /><br />The picture is sensational. I had watched the previous first season episodes on DVDs. Those DVD episodes always looked good. Indeed I thought that that was as good as it got. Not so. The VOD HD picture is startleingly better. It has that \\"3D\\" quality that you read about on the video forums. It looks like a window not a film.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|Its a real good move, very entertaining. Shows how bond became so calous from the events of Casino Royale as well as its the only true sequel in the bond series... I am a big fan of the amazing action sequences, fantastic cinemotography and pretty decent acting and the bond girls are yummy too.
B00014X8KO|4.0|'Memories' is a great anime that comprises three video shorts. The first two are very good, but the last video short is somewhat weak and not very interesting. The first video short, 'Magnetic Rose', is dramatic, poignant, and touching, and is in the style of the old Twilight Zone tv series. The second, 'Stink Bomb', has it's own unique gut-wrenching humor and drama and has a killer ending. I highly recommend this anime title.
B00008ADPF|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest album of all time, with the gods of music smiling down and accepting Chad into their group. All the songs are raw, radio friendly, and diverse, and Someday is an underplayed, underrated masterpiece of all. Even though it is hard to say which Nickelback album is the best, as all of them are classics.<br /><br />And for those who hate this all-American band, I must ask you, if Nickelback suck so much, how come they get so much radio play? Only the good songs get on the radio. So you can take your indie crap and stick it where the sun don't shine. Because everything is better with Nickelback, even crappy anime, as seen here: [...]<br />Replace the (dot) with a . and prepare to be blown away.<br /><br />Overall, you must get this epic masterpiece.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|We had Graceland in tape format years ago and absolutely wore it out.  Hard to find a CD, and was so glad I thought to check Amazon.  My husband and I call it our \\"Going Bye-Bye Music\\" because whenever we start out on a road trip we blast You Can Call Me Al.  Also, this work was our first introduction to the transcendently beautiful Ladysmith Black Mambazo.  Happy Days eh?
0679746323|5.0|The most valuable portions of the book for me are those that deal with the history of the Korean War. The standard theory taught in American schools says China came into the war because the US attacked north of the 38th parallel. According to this book, that's false. China had planned to enter the war from the beginning-- it was all part of a strategy. According to the book, Mao was after Soviet military (especially nuclear) technology. He wanted more than just manufactured armaments, he wanted the means to create them-- an industrial infrastructure. The book provides many references to back up these and many other claims dealing with that war. If true they furnish a major correction to the left-leaning narrative given to American students.    A note to the negative reviewers. In reading through these reviews I find they are long on criticism and short on details. Tell me exactly what statements in the book are false and provide a credible reference. It seems to me that this book has lured the communists out of the woodwork who don't want the record corrected.
0586091718|5.0|This book is referenced by David Icke and I purchased it largely because he spoke to it in his many taped dialogues.  I regard the book as being current on the new physics and its relationship to the body. We are more than merely 5 senses and we are capable on many levels of being greater than we know, while this is a given, it is difficult to express verbally or to share.  We are very much connected to one another and we share more than we recognize in this very materialistic, tactile world.  It is wonderfull to be alive in a era that recognizes our humanity,togetherness, despite living concurrently in a era that seems to feel that war remains a viable instrument to impact people.  But folks are waking up and recognize war for the racket that it is and the money changers who profit.  Hopefully, more readers will enjoy this volume on the multiple levels of awareness that it offers the world.
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|This movie is Oscar material, it has the right ingredients:   Holocaust tinged story line? Check.  Actors making dramatic, serious speeches. Yep.  A \\"tragic death\\" (other than the general Nazi genocide) near or at the end? Check again.  \\"Adult\\" themes (on-screen banging)? Check.  The crew that put this film together really know how to fish for that Oscar.  Yes, you are being manipulated by this movie like a an Italian chef manipulates pizza dough. But sit back and enjoy the experience, if you must.
B0000UBNGU|5.0|Back in early 2000, Apple mentioned that it was going to release a collection containing all of The Beatles' hits that reached number one in both England and America. The album, titled, \\"The Beatles 1\\", was officially released on November 14th, 2000, just in time for holiday shopping sales. Surprisingly, this album became a huge hit release. It debuted at number one in its first week in the Billboard Top Album charts, the fourth Beatles album in a row to accomplish this feat following the 3 Anthology albums. It was also number one in 34 different countries around the world, going on to become the best selling album ever released on a global scale. The song selection is extraordinary, and each of the four sides of the vinyl represented appropriately different styles and phases of the Beatles' career: in order, Beatlemania's Mersey Beat style, folk-rock/pre-psychedelic style, purely experimental/psychedelic style, back to basics/rock style.    side one, 1962-1964   1. Love Me Do   2. From Me To You   3. She Loves You   4. I Want To Hold Your Hand   5. Can't Buy Me Love   6. A Hard Day's Night   7. I Feel Fine   8. Eight Days A Week    side two, 1965-1966   1. Ticket To Ride   2. Help!   3. Yesterday   4. Day Tripper   5. We Can Work It Out   6. Paperback QWriter   7. Yellow Submarine   8. Eleanor Rigby    side three, 1967-1968   1. Penny Lane   2. All You Need Is Love   3. Hello, Goodbye   4. Lady Madonna   5. Hey Jude    side four, 1969-1970   1. Get Back   2. The Ballad Of John And Yoko   3. Something   4. Come Together   5. Let It Be   6. The Long And Winding Road    What you have here is over 79 minutes of Beatles classics, gathered together into one cohesive and handy set. This double album is packaged in a gatefold cover with a painted yellow \\"1\\" over a red background, and a light-pink extended T Beatles logo in the upper left-hand corner. The back of the cover lists the song titles, while the interior of the gatefold cover shows four colorful psychedelic Richard Avedon portraits of the group which were taken in London on August 17th, 1967. The custom designed labels on the records also feature the same graphics as depicted on the album's front cover. The discs themselves were pressed on specially manufactured 180 gram vinyl, which is slightly thicker and heavier than most conventional vinyl discs. This also gives the music a much cleaner and warmer sounding feel. There was also a special edition of the album released onto 2 picture discs, which feature one of each portrait on a single side (John, side 1; Paul, side 2; George, side 3; Ringo, side 4.) The two discs are housed in specially printed inner sleeves, which show a unique selection of picture sleeves on one side and information pertaining to the album's songs on the other side. This double album set also includes 8 1/4\\" x 11 1/4\\" reproductions of the of the four individual Richard Avedon portraits and a 24\\" x 36\\" poster displaying a total of 126 picture sleeves from Beatles singles that were issued in various countries around the world. The deluxe packaging of the vinyl album, along with its four portraits and poster, are reminiscent to that of \\"The White Album\\". Billboard magazine would go on to name \\"The Beatles 1\\" as its Album of the Year for 2001, and also name The Beatles as the number one group of the year, as well. Despie the fact that other Beatles albums also went to number one, \\"The Beatles 1\\" was the only Beatles album to be given the unique designation as an Album of the Year by Billboard, an honor most deservedly long overdue. What sets this particular collection apart from others is that it spans The Beatles' entire professional recording career, as well as featuring only original songs penned by the band, all in one compilation. If there is any singles album that shows the true genius of The Beatles on any level, then it is definitely \\"The Beatles 1\\".
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Tough and gritty, living every day as if it was his last - this was James Bond as penned by Ian Flemming.  Smoking the strongest cigarettes available, drinking the best, enjoying the finest life has to offer, as his profession may easily bring about his death tomorrow.  Totally loyal to the crown, ruthless in the execution of his duties.  This IS James Bond as he was meant to be presented to the world, not as a wise-cracking, womanizing \\"cartoon\\" character.    Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace finally get it right after almost 50 years.  A Bond who has to put his personal feelings aside, one who is truly injured when a woman he has been intimate with is killed as a result of their relationship.    No mechanical alligators, pirahana-filled ponds, or Jaws.  Just some exciting, hard edged film making, featuring a talented lead (Daniel Craig) who can also show a human side while plowing through the plot like a one-man army.    If you want entertainment in the vein of 24 or the Die Hard series, here's what you've been looking for.  If you want soft-porn cartoons, search for a Ralph Bakshi flick...

Worth every cent and more!!!!!!
B00008YLV2|5.0|One of the best war movies at showing the confusion, shock, intensity, and frustration of combat. Powerfully true to life.  Surround Sound effects are first rate; you might think you're right there, especially in some of the fire fights when the rockets are whooshing and bullets whizzing by the Rangers.<br /><br />The scenes showing the 2 Delta Force soldiers putting themselves in the midst of overwhelming odds to rescue the crew of one of the downed Blackhawk helicopters seems so true to life to the actual rescue effort for which they were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.<br /><br />The best performance I've seen by Hartnett with \\"spot on\\" performances by a very talented cast.  Ridley Scott succeeds again. This is a treat for war movie fans.

B000LC4TJ0|5.0|Singing doesn't get any better than this, but the weird production and lack of thoughtfullness in set design, make this off-puting.  I don't like singers lying on the floor when such staging has no purpose at all.  This  should have been released as a CD and not a DVD. I really liked the singing  and the selection of the singers. My five star rating is only because the   singing is so good.

0439023483|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - fast paced, snappy dialogue, excellent storyline development - and as Book 1 of a promised trilogy (Book 2 is due out in September 09 according to Amazon) there is certainly a great deal of potential.  Katniss Everdeen lives in a future where the USA has been divided into military districts of starving citizens, gloated over by a strange \\"Capitol\\" which seems a bit like an exaggeration of our modern day society.  Every year, 2 teenagers are chosen from each district to fight in the Hunger Games, which is broadcast as a reality show.  Only 1 of the 24 entrants will win, and they must kill off their opponents to claim victory, and preserve their own life.  Katniss is a character without a lot of depth, which makes a certain kind of sense because as the author recognises well into the book, Katniss' daily life is consumed with hunting and trying to provide food for her mother and sister.  There is little other time to work out the meaning of her life and who she is apart from provider (I am hopeful this will be the core of Book 2).  There is a confusing romance going on in the book, and Katniss' allegiance to Peeta, her fellow District 12 Hunger Games contestant and Gale, her partner in hunting at home.  This is never resolved, which is annoying but again, a trilogy requires certain themes to carry over between books and this is a big one.      Stephen King wrote an interesting review of this book on Amazon (initially for Entertainment Weekly I believe) and he makes some good points.  Firstly, we all know reality tv is evil and Collins isn't the first author to go down that track (King points out he did the same with The Running Man) and to be honest, the whole \\"reality tv sucks\\" theme is a bit played out these days.  Secondly, he accuses Collins of some \\"lazy storytelling\\" which refers to never mentioning the actual cameras, although Katniss is filmed at every moment and knows she is being filmed and also whenever Katniss really needs something food, medicine etc, it is parachuted down to her in the game by a \\"sponsor\\".  I know from reading King's \\"Writers on Writing\\" that he is particularly harsh on lazy storytelling (understandably so) whereas while I see his point, it wasn't something that bothered me at the time of reading.      I'm not a fan of the \\"nuclear fallout\\" books (mind you, Collins never actually says what happened to cause the breaking of the USA) but I did enjoy this one.  I'll leave it a while before I pick up book 2, but I do want to know what happens when Katniss gets home and where that darn romance ends up!
0810979772|5.0|I bought two of these journals, one for my 11 year old nephew and one for a nine year old boy. Both boys are fans of the \\"Wimpy Kid\\" Series. I sat with each of the boys after they received the gift, flipping through the pages and listening to their answers to the questions. They had a great time thinking about their responses and enjoyed sharing them with me. Not only did we laugh and have fun reading the book, but also I got to know them a bit better by hearing their answers, many of which require creativity and imaginiation.     My nephew was so excited by the book, that he read portions of it to his family, and any friends who visited, throughout the duration of my visit (when I gave him the book).    His 12 year old brother was spotted reading the book on a few occasions too!    The book has a nice balance of questions about life accomplishments and experiences (i.e. Have you ever stayed up all night? ) and ideas about the future (i.e. How much will a cheeseburger cost in 20 years? Who will be President in 20 years?). It also provides space for children to draw cartoons.    I like the fact that children can do this book on their own and since the questions asked are not too personal, they can also sit with an adult and share their ideas and responses.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|So here's what's up--this is one of the greatest movies of the decade, one destined to be seen as one of the greatest of all times.  I do not say that lightly.  I am writing from Ebertfest and while there were a number of interesting films screened, this one was in a class by itself.<br /><br />The story: we are in the silent-screen era of Hollywood, in Los Angeles in an unspecified year.  A stuntman has been injured in a terrible fall and he is recuperating in a hospital along with a small girl, who has also suffered a fall and broken her arm.  They encounter one another and he tells her an epic revenge story about a group of men who have been victimized by an evil governor.  As the story develops we see that the individuals participating in the story have their lookalike counterparts among the patients and staff of the hospital.  The story is part fantasy/part fairy tale, with scenes in India, Bali, South Africa and points east, west, north and south.  The images are breathtakingly lush, though the use of CGI technology was kept to a minimum.  What you see is actually what was there.  The story is something like Peter Greenaway (on an optimistic day) meets The Princess Bride meets Lawrence of Arabia meets The Wizard of Oz.  The evocation of the latter is particularly strong, though the director contends that he has never seen that film.<br /><br />The acting is stunning, particularly that of the injured stuntman and the little girl (Lee Pace and Catinca Untaru).  The script is perfectly modulated as it moves between terror, humor, violence and utter sweetness.  Ultimately, this is a movie about storytelling, particularly cinematic storytelling.  It is a story about the ways in which stories save our lives, shape our world, develop our hearts and minds, stretch our imaginations and instill a sense of awe, wonder and delight.  It is richly imagined, deeply moving and exceptionally satisfying.<br /><br />Ebertfest previously advertised itself as focusing upon `overlooked' films.  That notion has sometimes been honored in the breach, for well-known films have been screened.  The Fall, however, is quintessentially `overlooked' in that it should have received the recognition it deserves: a best picture, best director, best supporting actress and best script nomination at a minimum.  This is a dazzling film--haunting, beautiful and in every way delightful.  It is a realistic paean to cinema and an exploration of the wonders of the human imagination and the aesthetic forms in which those wonders are realized.  Do not miss this film.  This is a bona fide life-changer.n has sometimes been honored in the breach, for well-known films have been screened.

B001W63DX2|3.0|Well, I am a huge Iron Maiden fan (my #1 band) and have all their CD's & DVD's. I've seen Maiden every time they've been to Pittsburgh since the mid 90's: 1996 with Blaze/club show, the 2000 Dickinson return- he rightfully so went off on an \\"elderly\\" bottle thrower!, 2003 promoting the DVD music videos set, and last at 2005 Ozzfest (Bruce was knocking the time slot/sound issues/reality TV stars and this was before \\"eggfest\\").   Now onto the film- I saw this at a limited showing \\"Maiden day\\" screening at a full theater (was surprised) in Pittsburgh PA on a Tuesday night. Sound & picture quality were amazing.   To those that were hoping that this might be slowed down in the concert editing, so that you can actually watch an instrument being played- I'm sad to inform that once again edits are fast paced.   It is a fun movie with a lot of 2008 live concert footage of their classic 80's songs. They go into some detail about the plane piloted by singer Bruce Dickinson (interviewed) and basically the film follows its journey around the world for 2 months.   Most footage and time is spent in South America- this is where Maiden is the most popular nowadays. There are a few funny outrageous fan moments and the chaos in South America from a Maiden show is intense.   There are many quick scenes with Nicko- he plays the joker part well the entire flick, a few brief interviews with   Steve, Adrain and Janick. Hardly anything of Dave Murray and nothing serious at all with Nicko. There are brief cameos/comments by Kerry, Lars and a few other \\"rock stars\\". The problem I had was that this was being billed as the 1st time Maiden was letting us into their lives and there was nothing new in this department. I didn't learn or see anything new about where they live, their houses (mansions ?), everday life away from the band, marriages, wives (no mention at all), kids (very brief shot of Steves kids only), hobbies, side bands/projects, plus so much more would have been interesting. Does Bruce still fence ? is his side band still going ? Any wives/kids go on tour besides Steve's ? Did Steve ever re-marry ? Does anybody keep in touch with past members (Blaze, Paul, Clive)regularly ? Is Eddie just a giant robot now ? - there was a brief shot of a guy remote controlling him. Whats the situation with famous cover artist Derek Riggs nowadays- last I heard he was suing the band.   Whats the deal with all the Maiden merchandizing out there now ? - how do members feel ?   Is there really going to be only 1 more studio album ? - long rumored !   Something thats been bothering me is that I've noticed multiple times now   in print/interviews and in person (see above/concerts) that Bruce clearly has some issues with older fans and American/United States fans.   At the end of the movie in Canada he bashes US fans for not accepting   Maiden as early as Canadians fans did. I'm 32 and got into Maiden in their \\"uncool\\" (at least in US) early 90's days. It would have been great to see some serious questions & answers to topics like these.   I already knew that they play some golf between shows - it was on the Rock In Rio 2000 DVD. The songs are great- but are edited and we will get them in full on the extended DVD/CD/Blu-ray sets that are coming. This will be a cool intro for non/new fans to watch - but leaves longtime fans still in the dark on many areas. Basically to us long time fans this will be a movie to show non-fan friends for a few laughs. Then watch/listen the full concert set which I'm sure will be great. Its way better than the whiney/depressing/bore fest that was Metallica's some kind of monster.   Basically a concert video with some Pantera style funny moments thrown in, I was expecting more from Maiden since they already have tons of concert videos. Also was expecting more since the filmmakers previous \\"Metal: headbangers journey\\" documentary was very in-depth & excellent.   PS: I realize that many of you will respond claiming I'm not a real fan or whatever and answer with basically made-up or internet rumour/unofficial fan site responses, please don't waste your time- I too can sumarize up some answers for my questions, but it would have been nice to have more official answers directly from the band.

B001R4MEYS|5.0|Crack the Skye exhibits an impressive maturation for Mastodon, clarifying and improving their artistry without shedding the fine craftsmanship which makes them distinct and exciting. The band may have struck gold with their cycle of fire/water/earth/air-themed albums, but such conceptualizations would be empty shells without the band's incredible technical proficiency. Crack the Skye succeeds brilliantly because Mastodon's odd combination of chaotic meters and rhythms and tightly controlled guitar-work not only perseveres but is actually showcased in this more simply structured album.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I truly love North and South.  This film has replaced Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility as my favorite.      I have always loved Jane Austen, and had read Gaskell's North and South some years ago and loved it as well.  I somehow missed the DVD when it first came out, and only saw it by chance on netflicks.  It was wonderful, so I immediately ordered this DVD.  I am so glad I did.      First of all, it is beautifully filmed.  Secondly, the DVD has much more of the story (cut from the netflix version).  I was also very happy to find the commentaries on the first and last hour.  I would have preferred commentaries focused less on architecture and technical details and more on the acting, but I am glad that they existed.    The DVD has first and last scenes with Margaret and Thornton that are quite different from the novel.  I thought the fight scene that introduces Thornton was well done, and did - for a modern audience - better explain Margaret's initial dislike.  The last scene of the two of them at the railroad station is quite good. I see the anacronism and am willing to suspend disbelief in the cause of a good romantic ending.  As with the book, I wanted more.  I wanted to know what happened after the ending - but that is the sign of an excellent drama.    The acting was wonderful, particularly the excellent Richard Armitage as Thornton.  He is an actor I have not seen before, but one I hope to see again.   Daniela Denby-Ashe was a lovely Margaret, while not as expert an actor.  Sinead Cusack, Brendan Coyle and the actress who played Bessie Higgins were all outstanding.

0375842381|5.0|I bought this book set in hopes that it was literature that could keep my imagination rolling, and it did more than that. Mark Pullman put together a work of art with this trilogy.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Change up on the intro was nice and the Starting sequence was working-- then, when the cast landed in Bolivia the air just went right out of the film.  It just couldn't get anything going...right down to the Gold Finger rip off of the dead girl on the bed in the hotel room--covered in gold--black gold, Texas tea.  You get the point.  I like the new Bond but the film was a let down.
B0006JGFNQ|4.0|Gizmo is great, anyone who went to the movies to see the gremlins will agree. So this is a collectors item, not really a kids toy. I love it, but I guess a kid won´t have any special interest and might see it just as another plush toy.
B000069I1C|2.0|Robert DeNiro use to be untouchable. He would crank out so many classics in the 70's, 80's, and early 90's. Today his films have been mostly flops rather then classics and nothing can touch his glory days. Now, add anther falling star in Eddie Murphy. He has had mega success in Shreik and Dream Girlz but he seems to make a good film and follow it up by making three bad films in a row. This brings us to the film Showtime. If this movie was filmed in the 80's it might be freshier and funnier. However, today this movie comes out as predictable and stale. DeNiro does his usual curmudgeon shtick with the usual facial expressions and Murphy still tries to act like he's the funniest man alive. The movie is alright but nothing i'd go out of my way for but its alright to watch if your just sitting around and have nothing better to do.
B001TOD92C|2.0|I came into this movie with high expectations.  Having seen many real wrestling documentaries and a fan for 25+ years I expected more than this movie provided.  The hype from the oscars was just that, hype for another poorly made movie.      The premise was good and this had alot of potential.  But it had poor character development and story development.  It has some decent action/wrestling scenes and alot of [...] scenes.  But that seemed to be the essence of the movie.  The relationship with the daughter and Pam came across forced and not well developed.     The thing that brings this movie from a 1 to a 2 is the documentary \\"Within the Ring\\" on the making of the film and working with the Indi wrestlers.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I thought is was a refresing bit of music. I am a fan of soundtracks and usually there are a few songs you have heard before on each. However this CD is just a great mix of music that I really enjoyed and it was all new to me! Made me want to hear more.
B001P59V5Y|5.0|One of the most viciously funny, sharply satirical, intellectually hilarious on ALL levels comedies ever made.  What's beautiful about this movie is that it's just flat-out hilarious to folks who dont have a sense of the historical context of the movie, but also the more do you know about it, the funnier this movie is.<br /><br />I still lose my breath laughing even though I've seen this movie hundreds of times since it first came out to (ranting and) raving reviews by the curious sect of eternally infuriated Christians with no sense of humour, who only served to provide a ton of free publicity for the film while it was still in theaters.<br /><br />This is a Python classic every fan - of either Python or just laughing in general - should own.
B000002GJH|3.0|This album has great moments, such as \\"Say hello to heaven\\", the \\"duet\\" with Vedder \\"Hunger Strike\\", and \\"Wooden Jesus\\".  But there are also some rather weak moments, like the way too long \\"reach down\\".  Overall, I would recommend this album if you are a cornell and pearl jam fan.  Otherwise, I would recommend downloading the highlights.
B001RTP48Q|4.0|The Pet Shop Boys newest album is fun,bubbly and harmonically catchy.This actually kinda sounds like Al Stewart sped up about 50 mph.I have listened to these guys growing up in the eighties and forgot what they sounded like.Great to have you guys back!

015206396X|4.0|Katsa's Grace (a special ability she possesses that is indicated by the dual color of her eyes) rules her entire life. She is Graced with the ability to kill, and is forced to be her corrupt uncle's assassin. Discontent with her life and her actions, she begins the Council, whose mission is to aid and protect citizens from their power hungry and sometimes ruthless leaders. It is while she is on a mission for the Council that Katsa rescues Prince Tealiff, the elderly father of the Lienid king, who has been kidnapped by an unknown enemy. When his grandson Po comes looking for him, Katsa and Po begin a tentative friendship in order to discover who would kidnap a harmless old man, and together discover an insidious plot that would drastically affect the entire land.    Kristin Cashore has created quite a vivid and unique world in Graceling. The concept of Graces is quite fascinating, and is the most enticing aspect of the book. Though Katsa is a strong, interesting, and likable character, it may be hard for readers to really get invested in the book until after 100 or more pages.    But around the middle of Graceling, the pace picks up as Katsa finds her independence and her relationship with Po intensifies. Readers will get swept up in the action as Katsa and Po must confront the source of their troubles against nearly insurmountable odds and race against time. Graceling finishes off with a scene that doesn't quite live up to its dramatic build-up, but is satisfying nonetheless. Cashore doesn't quite give her characters the happily-ever-after ending that readers will be wishing for, but rather a realistic and believable resolution that stays consistent with the characters' personalities. Graceling is a dramatic and thrilling read that is abundant with action, political intrigue, and romance that will leave some readers dreaming long after the last page.    Cover Comments: While this isn't the most striking cover I've seen, I do like the colors used, and I love the fontused for the title. The weathered look is very cool, and goes with the fantasy genre. It isn't overdone either, which makes the cover look polished, but not too cookie-cutter. I like it a lot.
0312539517|5.0|This book would be good pure fiction, but is even better because it is based on a true story. I bought the Kindle edition, and found it to be a perfect read. Though I have several other books on my K2, I found myself always clicking on this one -- so very enjoyable and easy to pick up, put down, pick up, put down.  To non-kindle readers, that's not a negative; it means that the story is good enough that it is a pleasant story to get back to often, regardless of reading environment.  I was always \\"in the mood\\" to read this....<br />I have a new found appreciation and affection for George Mallory after having read this book, and I elevate Mallory to the same level as Sir Edmund Hillary. The cool part of the book is the epilogue - refrain from reading it until you are done with the book -- as it tells you the real world \\"what happened\\" to everyone since the \\"story\\" ended.<br />Excellent read; a story that you keep thinking about long after the final chapter.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|This movie is disgusting, not uplifting. Every adult character is a brutal stereotype, the kids are all hyperactive acting, and the protagonist just stares with a blank look on his face the whole time. I hated it.
0385340990|4.0|Our church book study read this. Half were enjoying it so much couldn't put it down and read as fast as possible to the end.  The other half were enjoying it so much, they read it slowly, savoring every word, every story.  The series of letters compelled me to keep reading, to find out what was going to happen to whom next.  And I learned things about WWII that I never knew.  I loved it and have told almost everyone about it. I only gave it four stars because I couldn't give it 4.5.  I thought it could have been a little more revealing about the main character, Juliet, but overall, Loved it!
031606792X|1.0|Stephenie Meyer    is    without a single shadow of a doubt    A    Gigantic    Tool    and furthermore....    Proves    that     Social Marketing     really, really works.    And that our education system must be as horrible as they say it is.    And that there are a lot of lonely and aimless 30 and 40 year old women out there who don't get enough love from their husbands/fathers/kids/friends.    And that even though we constantly complain about not having enough time to do anything, we can still find the time to read literary junk food like this.      And that we are so superficial as a society that all it takes is a few descriptions of pretty vampires and casting of handsome actors, and the phenomenon known as the Internet, to allow--nay--CAUSE a deplorable series such as this to skyrocket to literally unbelievable wealth and fame.     Shame on you, SM, publishers and anyone else who encouraged this woman to become a writer along the way.
0307277887|1.0|I can't review the item because I never received it.  I am pretty disappointed that the person I bought the book from sent it \\"book rate\\".  We Alaskan's generally get pretty poor service thru the USPS unless the item is sent air mail.  I'll probably get the book in June and it's the first in a series so needless to say I'm not too happy.
B001PPLIFU|1.0|After watching this movie, I was left with a feeling of disapointment as it did not live up to the standard of a great or even a good James Bond Movie.  It was the worst James Bond movie I had ever seen.  It lacked the usual James \\"Bond features such as gimmicks and cars that were amazing and the acting was so unenthusiastic that it put me to sleep!. At times it was even hard to remember that this was a movie about the great 007 agent who outwitted so many great adversaries.  I hope if they continue with this series that the next movie goes back to the original James Bond theme and includes the features that made James Bond so great to watch!
B001E2JNA6|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the 1996 BBC TV five-hour mini-series starring Colin Firth, is the most faithful screen adaptation of the Jane Austen novel.  Elizabeth Bennett (Jennifer Ehle) is a strong-willed, sensible young woman whose father is a gentleman with a modest estate, but the family suffers in status because of an uncle who works as a businessman in Cheapside.  She has four sisters and a mother eager to marry them to wealthy young gentlemen.  Elizabeth meets such a man -- Fitzwilliam Darcy (Colin Firth) -- at a local ball, but he is arrogant and rude and there is instant mutual distaste.     Colin Firth ranks as one of the better screen Darcys, a group that includes Laurence Olivier.  Jennifer Ehle is very good as Elizabeth Bennett.  There is very little action here, so the story tends to bog down frequently and the concerns of the characters can wear thin.  But the production is lavish, with outdoor scenes and period costumes often stealing the spotlight, and a cast of accomplished British actors give the mini-series the proper authenticity.  There are several bonus extras in this two-disc Blu-ray edition, including a making-of featurette and a look at the adaptation from novel to screen.

B002436WJE|4.0|\\"Taken\\" combines elements of the James Bond films with the tale of a father's attempt to build a relationship with a daughter for whom he was never there in her younger years.  It is a fast-paced, exciting action thriller made with style and polish.  If analyzed too closely, its preposterous and coincidental events would strain any reasonable credibility.  But never mind.  \\"Taken\\" is a neat, roller-coaster ride of a flick.<br /><br /> Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his CIA job and relocated in order to be closer to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who lives a life of wealth and privilege with her mother (Famke Janssen) and stepfather (Xander Berkeley).  Bryan reluctantly gives his consent for Kim to spend the summer in Paris, on condition she call him every day.<br /><br />At the Paris airport, Kim falls under the charms of a handsome young Frenchman who is actually part of a ring designed to kidnap young, foreign women for sale to Arab sheiks.  Kim is conveniently on the phone with Bryan when the kidnappers arrive.  Bryan immediately contacts his former friends in the CIA to piece together evidence he has culled from the brief phone call, which he had the foresight to record.<br /><br />The balance of the movie follows Bryan as he attempts to track down Kim in Paris.  During his quest, we see that this quiet, soft-spoken man has an entirely different side; he is a highly trained field agent who knows his way around self-defense, weapons, bribery, interrogation, torture, and forgery.  Working mostly alone, he takes on a bevy of bad guys and scurrilous types as he follows the trail to his daughter, dispensing with a good deal of civility along the way.<br /><br />\\"Taken\\" is not a great film, but the kind that draws you in and holds tight for ninety minutes.  Director Pierre Morel has staged some exciting set pieces, a nifty car chase, and explosions, and tossed in a collection of surly thugs and rich, well-dressed villains to spice things up.  We root for Bryan because his use of violence is directed only against those who deserve it.  He is ruthless and doesn't subscribe to the unwritten cinema rule that the good guy must be fair, upright, law-abiding, and moral at every turn no matter how difficult the going gets.  Bryan has no compunctions against knocking off anyone who might have had any part in his daughter's abduction.<br /><br />Neeson is an interesting choice for an action hero.  He looks more like a college professor, and that's the point.  When he springs into action, it is unexpected and his proficiency is startling.  He refers to his former occupation with the government as a \\"preventer,\\" but it soon becomes clear that his job involved more than polite roundtable diplomacy.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan thinks in nanoseconds, sizing up his immediate surroundings, assessing the degree of danger he's up against, and determining his offense or defense.  We, the viewers, are often surprised by his swift, efficient moves.<br /><br />Michel Abramowicz's photography enhances the film's action sequences and Frederic Thoraval's editing makes scenes shot piece by piece look seamless.  This is especially evident in fight scenes, which are abundant.<br /><br />It's surprising that \\"Taken\\" is rated PG-13.  Its violence, sexual content, plot references to drug use, and strong language would seem to justify an R, but strange are the ways of the MPAA.
0595440096|5.0|I chose this book because when my younger brother was 46 he was dignosed with a short term memory problem. I thought by reading this I may understand some of the frutrations he and his family are experiencing.  You always think about this as an elderly disease but this opened my eyes to many other items I never even considered before.  I hope this is her first of many books to come.  I devoured this in two days.  I think everyone should have this book becasue eventually I think we may all know someone with alzheimers.

0060934913|5.0|I found this book really entertaining, I couldnt put it down! Anthony Bourdain tells the insides of the restaurant business only someone deep inside the industry can tell. I highly recommend.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|I have to rate this one because of the unnecessary full male nudity and drawn out scenes of a woman's breast. This isn't about \\"what's wrong with a human body\\" argument time.  This was a historical docudrama.  The nudity only distracted from the story.  It served absolutely no purpose.  Had it been properly R rated, I wouldn't have to be writing this review because I would have skipped watching anything R rated from HBO.    The above is a good enough reason to skip this series.  However, the series didn't measure up after the first DVD.  The first disk was very engaging for me.  It was interesting how the US was begun, according to this story teller.  I suppose I should read the book if it's at all based on fact.  The last two DVDs were more soap opera interpersonal relationships that got boring after awhile.
B00008GKEG|5.0|If you grew up with The Beatles as I did, you will connect strongly with this anthology. It couldnt be better since we finally have a biography spoken from Paul, John, George, & Ringo's perspective. The honesty offered from them in regard to the past, their music, their lives, and travels is surprising and a refreshing standpoint from all of the written material available. The reunion with the remaining three at the time was as touching as it gets and made me realize, this was a retrospective of not only their lives....but mine. They have no idea the positive impact they had on my life and I will eternally be grateful for that. This is a MUST have for all Beatles fans even if you didnt grow up with them. The information it provides will certainly bring you closer than you could ever be, and its worth every minute.<br /><br />JC
B0000A55TX|5.0|He really is the best. Loved this CD. No one does the classics as well as he does, with the possible exception of Michael Feinstein.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|This CD reveals the ever changing talent that has had a grip on us since the Beatles came to the US. Pauls use of our senses allows us to see, touch, smell, and taste the beauty that is his imagination and his music.<br />We benefit in the act by being able to touch our own souls through his craft. It just doesnt get any better. This is a keeper!!<br /><br />JC

0805053883|3.0|ISBN 0805053883 - Curious to know what a polar would hear... I'm just a wee bit disappointed because I still don't know. The fact that this book is by the author of [[ASIN:1416927182 Chicka Chicka Boom Boom (Book& CD)]] was an added attraction because Bill Martin Jr's always a favorite here.<br /><br />What does a polar bear hear? He hears the sounds of the animals around him in the zoo! The sounds they make aren't the traditional, and fairly boring, \\"meow\\" of a cat or \\"woof\\" of a dog, either. There's the peacock yelping and a flamingo fluting and so much more.<br /><br />The unusual animal sounds will no doubt present parents with a challenge. How many can imitate a snorting hippo or the bellow of a walrus? Children will enjoy the effort, of course, and the book serves the purpose of introducing more uncommon animals than most. To make it work, I'd suggest taking it along to the zoo, seeking out the animals inside and learning their noises - adding an extra level of education AND fun. The illustrations, by Eric Carle, are bright and colorful. Each animal takes up a pair of facing pages.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks
0142002038|3.0|It terms of plot, this book is almost indentical with the film version.  I like the character of Dr. No, his background is quite creepy, and makes his eccentric character quite believable when you read all the details, which are finally revealed near the end.  Bond has some very tough challenges in this book, the character of Honey Rider is pretty weird, and some may feel she ruins the story.  The book is over-the-top at times, like Bond's battle with a giant octopus, and it does come off as unquestionably racist toward Blacks and Asians.  Overall, I would probably read this if you're planning on reading multiple Fleming novels, but if you just want to read one Fleming Novel, go with a different one, I recommend From Russia With Love, it's much better.
B000VWYJ8G|4.0|Another fast paced, but I think, the least interesting, of the Bourne trilogy.  Still, it is another very good movie, if you like action and intrigue.
0812966066|4.0|I was totally into this book, turning page after page to unravel the very clever mystery.  I don't give plot \\"spoilers\\", so generally this is about how Sherlock Holmes investigates a most unusual mystery involving an interesting \\"family myth\\" centering around how a cursed dog stalks and kills them.  There are a few plot twists that I didn't see coming, and I was very happy with the book as a whole, it never gets boring, and the characters are very well developed, and will at times keep you guessing.  The deductive reasoning of Sherlock Holmes is very rewarding to read, and puts a smile on the readers face.  I recommend this one if you want to try out Doyle, or read a mystery novel.
B0017HEYEI|1.0|When I purchased this product it did not mention the DVD was entirely in Korean. I can't even watch it. What a waste of money. I will never use this seller again.
0060574216|2.0|It's a good book, it obviously has an important theme about men and women getting along.  The book however, pounds the same concepts into your head over-and-over again.  The book can be summerized in one sentence:  \\"When women need to talk, let them vent, and when guys want to be alone, give them their \\"batcave\\" time in their den or study...\\"
0446401307|4.0|When his lieutenant phones him after midnight, Harry is still awake. Arriving at the scenic overlook above Mulholland Dam, he finds a man dead in an execution style shooting. The victim's a medical physicist with daily access to dangerous radioactive substances, and it soon appears that he has been forced to supply a large quantity of cesium to terrorists. FBI agents show up almost immediately, and the competition to solve this case begins.<br /><br />Connelly incorporates characters familiar to his readers from earlier Bosch novels, as well as a new and personable young partner, Iggie Ferras. It takes some fancy footwork on Harry's part to buck the system and untangle disparate threads. Not one of the edgier Bosch novels, but fun to watch him grapple with  problems he has never had to face before. Still living up to his Nam nickname, Harry Kari.<br /><br />The Overlook was originally published in serial form in the New York Times.
0451528956|3.0|Most people already know the general plot, so I will skip a plot summary, If you're in school and this is manditory reading, I would say \\"that's fine, have fun with it\\" Otherwise Stevenson's storytelling style is mundane compared to even some of the books from his time, and if you know the story of Jekyll and Hyde, there's really no surprise factor to look forward to.  It's always going to be a classic, and the duality of humanity (good and evil) in many ways is explored for the first time, and that is a theme that will live forever and keep this story a classic.  But if you could read anything you want, I would look elsewhere, storytelling has evolved thanks to classic authors like Stevenson paving the road for more complex stories and adventures.  The good/evil duality, & humans shapeshifting has been redone many times and some of the new stuff out there is just more fun to read than this.

0425166805|2.0|I think Eric Von Daniken is a thoughtful man, and he has a passion for alternative explanations of past civilizations.  I leave the door open for different explanations regarding ancient people, but Van Daniken is such a believer that he puts a little bit too much \\"spin\\" on his findings in order to support his theories that ancient peoples were visited by aliens.  I suppose these visits were possible, when one examines some of the surprising knowledge these people seem to have had based on their architecture and artwork, it could be true.  But at the same time, I think it's very possible that ancient civilizations were more intelligent and capable than Van Daniken gives them credit for.  Maybe some of these societies were very intuitive when it came to astronomy and architecture, that is just as likely an explanation for their maps they made, and their buildings they constructed as the aliens building things and teaching ancient man about the cosmos, and mapping the world for them.  I wouldn't call Van Daniken a charlatan, but he puts a lot of spin on his findings, and he's very loose with his definition of a fact.
0786838655|4.0|This book/series was recommended to me by some neighbors.  The 12 year old daughter in the family read and loved the series and the mother also enjoyed it a lot.  I picked up the first book around Christmas time and it sat on my shelf for the next couple of months.  In the meantime, I saw numerous reviews of the book and the series, many of them calling it \\"Harry Potter with Greek mythology rather than wizardry.\\"  When I finally started reading the book, I was determined not to compare it too closely to Harry Potter.  Unfortunately, I found myself quickly falling into that trap.    From a high level, there are a lot of similarities.  The book focuses on Percy Jackson.  Percy is a 6th grade kid having trouble at school (always getting into trouble for \\"strange things\\" happening) and at home (where his stepdad is just vile and cruel to him).  Percy's mother is around, which is a difference from the Potter formula, but the similarities grow as Percy's life is found to be in danger and he goes away to a special \\"camp\\" for others like him.    I don't want to spoil the plot or formula of the book too much, but let me just say that there are a TON of parallels that can be drawn between the world of Percy Jackson and the world of Harry Potter    And then let me say...That's not a bad thing.  I've taken numerous creative writing course and workshops over the years.  In many of them, a comment was made to the effect of \\"If you find something you like in a story, steal it and make it your own.\\"  This comment is not speaking of plagiarism or directly ripping off a plot, setting, character or language.  What it means is that writers should also be readers.  And when a reader/writer finds something that intrigues or inspires, the writer should see what can be done with it.  In my own writing, I've mimicked style, formula and language many times and sometimes I even make allusions to the piece that inspired me.  In this case, Riordan likely saw the solid structure and adaptabilityof Rowlings form and used it as a skeleton to structure his own story.  The story itself is different enough in the way things play out so as to overcome any hindrance caused by similarities.  In fact, in many places, I felt that Percy Jackson's initial story was more solid than Harry Potter's initial story (though in other places, it was weaker).  Generally, I came away liking this initial book in the series more than I liked the first book in the Potter series.    OK...now that I've done what I'd hoped not to do (compare the two books), let me speak solely of Percy Jackson.  Percy is a vivid and interesting character.  He has a lot of depth of emotion and thought which brings him to life and helps the reader feel compassion and empathy towards him.  The world created by Riordan feels distinctive and realistic.  Being set in first person, we see the world through the eyes of young Percy complete with his 21st century vocabulary and expectations.  The language was very accessible and a lot of fun and helped make the story feel more real to me.  The plot itself was fun and exciting with the requisite twists and turns to help our young hero \\"come of age\\" as it were.    I really enjoyed this book.  It's a quick read and a lot of fun.  I'll certainly dig into the other books in the series and can easily recommend this, especially to young readers.  There wasn't anything objectionable (perhaps the \\"statue\\" at the very end of the book could be seen as too vindictive, but it was played off lightly) for a young reader and the storyline is quite fun.  The mythology presented is well researched and as a result, a reader may come away from the book learning something new (shh, don't tell them).  It's nothing terribly deep or heavy (perhaps future books will have heavier themes, similar to the way the Potter series progressed), which is fine.  Overall it's just a quick, fun adventure well worth experiencing.    ****  4 stars (out of 5)
0553288105|4.0|What I love about Asimov, is that you don't have to be a science fiction fan, or a Star Trek geek to enjoy his books, and this concept shows in The Gods Themselves.  I don't like giving plot \\"spoilers\\" so just a basic summary, the book is about an electron pump which allows communication between 2 universes.  In the parellel universe the main character has a combination of unique powers that nobody else has, which immediately intrigues the reader.  This book is perfect for anyone of any age, it's got great character development, it's mysterious, and it's not overly scientific or technical, it's just great storytelling.  Let me just say that Asimov is not only a great writer in his genre, he's one of the best authors ever, in any category.  This book won't dissapoint.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's superb drama \\"The Wrestler\\" provides Mickey Rourke with the role for which he will undoubtedly be most remembered - that of \\"Randy `the Ram' Robinson,\\" a professional wrestler long past his prime, who is attempting to mount a comeback both as a fighter and as a father to the daughter (beautifully played by Rachel Evan Ward) whom he abandoned earlier in life.<br /><br />Rarely does an actor get the chance to inhabit a role quite as fully as Rourke does here.  With his bulging muscles and greasy, long-flowing, bleach-dyed locks, Rourke - who did his own stunts for the film - brings an amazing physicality to the character, making us feel every ache, pain and body blow the man suffers, both inside the arena and out, as he hauls his massive, badly bruised carcass through life.  Randy shows that he suffers no illusions about that life, as he confesses to his daughter, \\"I'm an old broken-down piece of meat, and I'm alone and I deserve to be alone.\\"  But there's something about Randy - call it his gentleness of spirit or his self-effacing modesty - that nevertheless wins us over to his side.  Indeed, for all his physical imposingness, Randy is a surprisingly tender individual who knows he's screwed up in life and now wants to make amends and rebuild bridges with the one person he cares about most.<br /><br />This \\"soft\\" side of Randy is most evident in his relationship with \\"Cassidy,\\" a stripper who is herself getting on in years.  In fact, Randy and Cassidy are united in the fact that they are both trapped in professions that are less than kind to those who are aging.  Even though the role of Cassidy could easily have slipped over into the-stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold territory, the intelligence of the writing and the subtle richness of Marisa Tomei's performance prevent that from happening.<br /><br />Screenwriter Robert D. Siegel keeps the story spare and simple, not cluttering it up with fancy narrative flourishes or overblown melodramatics.  With the wintry coastal New Jersey setting as his backdrop, director Aronofsky lets the drama unfold at a seductively leisurely pace, allowing us get to know each of these characters and the rhythm of their lives in finely-drawn, intimate detail.  And even though Rourke has elicited richly deserved praise for the physical pounding he endured for the role, it is in the quieter and subtler moments - when we get to see the inner workings of the character he's portraying - that the actor's talent and dedication to the role truly shine through.  It is, indeed, a performance for the ages and one that students of acting will be studying and attempting to emulate for decades to come.w Jersey setting as his backdrop, director Aronofsky lets the drama unfold at a seductively leisurely pace, allowing us get to know each of these characters and the rhythm of their lives in finely-drawn, intimate detail.

B000093FLA|2.0|After the huge (and much deserved) success of \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\", Guy Richie must have practically been begged to replicate it on a bigger budget and with big-name actors. The resulting movie, \\"Snatch\\", although just as successful, if not more so, than its forerunner, however, just isn't quite up to the standard set by Richie's first film.     The greatest strength of \\"Lock, Stock...\\" was its script. Richie's many stories of British lowlifes neatly intersected to produce one of the most memorable endings of all time. Richie clearly tried to write a similar script with \\"Snatch\\" and he succeeds to a certain degree - the multiple storylines are present and they do intersect to form a satisfactory ending, but the plot of \\"Snatch\\" (which centres around a diamond heist and illegal boxing games) is more convoluted than that of \\"Lock, Stock...\\" (there are too many storylines, which make the film difficult to follow at times) and the storylines don't tie in quite as neatly. While I still remembered the ending of \\"Lock, Stock...\\" over 10 years after I first saw it, I am having difficulties remembering the details of the ending of \\"Snatch\\" two days after watching it.     \\"Snatch\\" is not a bad film and it contains some very funny stand-alone scenes. The cast is fantastic, although perhaps the film could have benefited from containing fewer big-name actors, since very few of the \\"stars\\" get the opportunity to shine, and in many ways Brad Pitt's character feels like a carry over from his previous movie, \\"Fight Club\\" (whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to you). Nevertheless, I hesitate to recommend this film. If you happen to find it showing one night on late-night television, then it might be worth giving it a try, but it's definitely not an \\"essential\\" movie.

0792164903|2.0|This movie is really bad.  Tim Burton is a lousy director and writer, but often brings some interesting visuals and ideas to a movie if he is controlled (usually by someone else writing the script).<br /><br />He has made some great stuff:  Batman, Big Fish, Sweeney Todd  (Nightmare before Christmas was not directed by him)<br /><br />He has made some awful stuff: Planet of the Apes, Batman Returns, and this movie.<br /><br />The movie is spared a one star because of some cool looking sets and a great (non-speaking) performance by Christopher Walken.  Everything else in the movie (maybe I'm forgetting something, Johnny Depp was ok, but well below his usual level) is pure garbage.  I would strongly recommend spending your DVD dollar elsewhere.
B001TCAT9U|5.0|OK. I was very disappointed when I first listen to it and gave 1 star reveiw (I've deleted it) now it is one of the masterpiece among SOFAD, Violator, Black Celebration.  It is no way Exciter 2 like someone said and it is far better than Ultra. You must listen to it carefully. There're no weak track at all even bonus tracks like 'Light' and 'Ghosts' are superb ! OK. Here are my favorite tracks - In Chains, Little Soul, In Sympathy, Peace, Come Back (highlight), Perfect, Miles Away / The Truth Is, Corrupt.  Are these enough ? Here is my updated list.    1) Songs of Faith & Devotion  2) Black Celebration  3) Violator  4) Some Great Reward  5) Music For The Masses  6) Sounds of The Universe  7) Ultra  8) Exciter  9) Construction Time Again  10) Speak & Spell  11) A Broken Frame
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I REALLY, REALLY wanted to love this series. After reading other reviews I just knew I would because I generally love all things Austen and English. I wanted to love it so much that I bought the DVD from Amazon because it was a \\"very long wait\\" in my Netflix queue. However, I was a bit disappointed in the end. I understand that it takes a drastic turn from the Pride & Prejudice novel I know and love, but I totally get what it is trying to be. I just didn't find that I liked the main character or Mr. Darcy very much. I found humor in certain scenes (the wet shirt/lake scene was absolutely hilarious), but other scenes made me cringe a bit (the \\"landing strip\\" comment at the beginning for example). In general I feel that Lost in Austen is an interesting idea and look forward to another Lost in Austen which I hear is coming out in the next couple of years (hopefully Sense & Sensibility). However, I feel this particular series just didn't live up to my expectations and I doubt I will ever watch the DVD again.

0316017922|3.0|Gladwell`s books are fun to read. Outliers is no different. Gladwell narrative is certainly captivating, motivating one to finish try reading the book in one sitting: ideal if you happened to pick up a copy at the airport bookstore prior to boarding a cross-continental flight like I did recently.     After reading the book, I was left musing about the takeaway. If it takes 10,000 hours, mostly during childhood to predict one's success (la Bill Gates), one better get started on the kids. And also ensure that the kids have an accident of fate. The Soviets probably knew this anyways, and went on to catch them young (la Nadia Comãneci?) and put them trough a rigor of over 10,000 hours of grueling training.     Summary: Entertaining read.
B0018LMZOE|5.0|Consistently rated one of the Moodies best albums...Mike Pinder pushed his song writing & lightened up on the mellotron, everyone contributed, they rocked harder than ever, this is probably their best collective effort. On this album they stripped away the excessive overlays and trimmed back the heavy sound effects (mellotron & chamberlin), even more so than they did on Question. It's still lush, it's still cosmic, and yes, It's the Moody Blues !!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|But what we got were some very cute kids down on their luck, and a great performance by 'Jamal' in all three iterations. The little girl was great too. The actors really made this film.  The ending was pure Bollywood, but I thought it was disrespectful to the dead Salim.      Best picture? Worthy, indeed, and I am thrilled for Danny Boyle, but what is all the hype for, and forgive me for asking, but why is the American film industry having such a hard time winning their own Oscars?
B000002U9W|2.0|I bought Atom Heart Mother in November 1971. I remember always enjoying the album though I also recall that the music critics were not very positive at the time. So here I am almost forty years on listening and assessing once again.<br /><br />There are several adjectives that critics and listeners threw at nearly any Pink Floyd project from day one until The Wall twelve years later. They are ambitious, brilliant, over-blown, self-indulgent and pretentious. Where one sits on the band dictates the adjectives that he chooses. I have thousand of records and cds. When I buy music I want to enjoy my purchase. I am not looking for flaws on either the technical or the artistic side. Although I enjoy reading what the music critics have to say I do from time to time find myself at odds with them. However much they laud Husker Du and Captain Beafheart I remain unimpressed. I prefer Rubber Soul, The Beatles and Abbey Road to Revolver and Pepper. I have always enjoyed the Bee Gees! This being said I think that perhaps they may have had it right on Atom Heart. Although I do like the Gilmour guitar bits on side one (the entire side is the long  titled \\"song\\") the rest of that side is rather uninteresting. If is pleasant but overlong and ultimately underwhelming. Side two contains a couple of reasonably worthwhile songs and another meandering extended \\"song\\". I don't like the shrill and jarring horns that are prominent from time to time.<br /><br />I am a fan of the band. I jumped on board at the very beginning back in 1967 and stayed on the Floyd train until after The Wall. I'm just not very fond of this record.

B00079HZUM|5.0|What a great study in theatre history.  However indiscriminate the author plays with actual history, he makes up with an engaging relationship between the two leading characters.  The costumes are also magnificent.  This film is a tribute to the birth of the actress.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry; he's very good at spinning facts and convincing people that smoking is their American right.  His young son isn't so sure about the ethics of Dad's job, however.<br /><br />This is a very funny, sarcastic movie.  I've seen Eckhart before but was never impressed, until now.  He is perfect as the fast-talking lobbyist with his dazzling smile and charismatic charm.  The cast is full of good actors in small but witty roles:  William H. Macy plays an anti-cigarette senator, Rob Lowe is wonderfully slimy as a Hollywood publicity man, Robert Duvall plays the tobacco boss, and Sam Elliott is the Marlborough Man.  It's filmed in a quasi-documentary style with lots of deadpan humor.  No one actually smokes in the movie, which is a good thing considering the cancer statistics that are quoted.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film; it really delivers big laughs while poking fun at the tobacco fat cats.
B00006IU73|3.0|IF YOU LIKE SPOCK'S BEARD YOU ARE PROBABLY GOING TO LIKE THIS.    In my opinion, this is the worst Porcupine Tree album.  It is the only one where I have considered ripping a few tracks that I like and dumping the rest of the CD.      This CD is in the style of the new British Progressive pop.  It sounds like the all the things that make Spock Beard and Transatlantic bad.  The pop sound and the gutless, spineless vocal harmonies.  It like a limp, sweaty handshake, or a wet finger being stuck in your ear.    It's really not that bad.  But, when you compare it to the other great albums by Porcupine Tree, it is a major disappointment.  It doesn't come close to the Sky Moves Sideways, Fear, or Nil Recurring.  It doesn't even come close to Deadwing.    So to describe the CD to help you decide.  The music is lighter and less complex than on their other CD's.  The vocals are lighter (although the theme matter is not so light).  It is not as complex or innovative.  I am relieved that Wilson did not stay with this style for very long.

B00008QSA5|3.0|I bought the original LP in 1968, still own it, and think it holds up well to the test of time. BUT, this \\"24-bit remastered CD\\" sounds like somebody took sandpaper to the audio - All the dynamics and life of the original mix on the original LP are missing here! A quick extract of this CD and comparison to a 24-bit capture of the LP on my PC shows why! Heavy compression of about 6db (making it twice as loud for you non-techies) was applied to the final mix used for this \\"rematered\\" CD. Yes it plays LOUD, but every single dynamic has been squashed - sax wails, guitar note bending, drum rims shots! Go find somone with a copy of the LP and rip a NOT-REMASTERED CD copy of the original mix, then, and only then, may you pass judgement on the \\"original\\" - Peace!

B00007L4OM|5.0|The movie was easy to locate by the leading persons name.  I find Jean Reno to be very good in his role as a detective, never getting over his love for a young lady he had not seen in 18 years and to later find out that he has a daughter by her and that she was murdered.  I enjoyed him in the Professional as a hit man who finds a liking for a young girl who hires him to put a hit out on a policeman who kills her family in this movie.  I just resently leaned how to surf the internet so tried Amazon again to find this movie.  I do find it easy to locate what I need through this websit.

They have grown as a band and continue to raise the bar on creativity. I LOVE the fact that we get songs from two of the best writers for this group (Martin & Dave) and not to mention the high caliber voices that contribute to each song. This is a great album. I agree that it should be listened to more than once. It does grow on you. Great job guys! Keep up the good work. Cheers!!!!!

1595141715|5.0|This book is quite possibly the best book I have ever read. It is so emotional and because of the emotion it is also extremely beautiful. Jay Asher has done something with the format of this book that I have never even heard  of before. He not only has duel narratives but he also formats the book around a central theme which is audio tapes. Even without the audio tape theme (which to me is an added bonus) the story of these two ill fated people is mesmerizing. I finished this book within a day and after reading it I have come away not only with a new favorite but a new perspective on life.  Please Read This Book If You Get The Chance! You won't regret it
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Diana Krall is the best of the jazz musicians around now. I love her Julie London sound on this CD. She does a deeply thrilling version of You're My Thrill. The Girl from Ipanama sounds fresh on this CD after hearing it so many times by other singers. She is a great pianist and I missed her piano playing on this CD.
B001TK3XPE|5.0|I have always believed that in order to be funny you must be really, really smart.  That explains both the success of David Lodge's numerous comic novels, many of which deal with academia, and his highly regarded critical essays.  He is the only living writer whose books I purchase religiously, so when Deaf Sentence was published I knew it was only a matter of time before it found its way into my personal David Lodge library.  The subject, an aging academic, a professor of linguistics, is losing his hearing (and fequently the batteries that operate his hearing aid)and this propells the various complications that ensue with his should-be-in-a-nursing home father, his newly successful entrepreneurial wife, and his ill advised mentoring of a young American doctoral student at his university. David Lodge is clever without being mean spirited, intellectual without being ponderous.  Perhaps that is why I return to his books again and again.
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|This is a timeless movie...for those who love these actors and love ITALY!!! this is a great collection.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I sincerely hope people give this album a few good listens before making final judgment. I was very disappointed after the first couple listens, and though I liked it a little bit, I was resigned to it being one of DM's worst. But the more I listened, the more I fell in love with it. Now I can't believe I ever didn't adore it, as I now feel it's one of DM's best! Unlike Playing the Angel, which I loved immediately, this one is more like Exciter in that it had to sink in and grow on me (Exciter is another of my favorites, by the way). Though I don't think SotU sounds anything like Exciter (I'm baffled by all the comparisons). And honestly, I think I like SotU even better than the last two. There aren't really any standout tracks here - the whole thing is just consistently good. That was one of the flaws of Playing the Angel; there were a few obvious standouts (all in the first third of the album), so it felt a little unbalanced. It's tough to pick favorites for this one - I genuinely love every song - but if I had to pick one absolute favorite, I'd have to go with \\"Corrupt,\\" which is a brilliant throwback to Violator. My least favorite track is probably the most commercial track, oddly enough. That would be \\"In Sympathy.\\" For the most part I really like it, but it's missing something, some major hook, mostly in the chorus. But anyway, I could not be more thrilled with the album. Give it a chance and you may be greatly rewarded. And for god's sake, people, get over the loss of Alan Wilder!

B00000K31Q|4.0|my daughter and i first saw this when it went to video, oh so many years ago, and really enjoyed it.  i let her know that it was a remake of 'taming of the shrew' by shakespeare and she wanted to see more.  from there she watched the commedia del arte version with mark singer (beastmaster) and couldn't get into it.  i wasn't sure whether to suggest the version with elizabeth taylor and richard burton but she insisted and loved it!!<br /><br />these releases are kinda sappy but if your child starts asking to see more of it in the original verse then, by all means, let them!<br /><br />beyond that, it's a fun movie and my goth, emo teenager will always sit to watch it with me.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|This movie itself is pretty different. Much like a moving comic book presentation. But it is the use of black&white along with the colors that make it such a visually stunning film. Even if you don't like the film it is worth watching for that. Personally, I like the film. Yes there is some very violent scenes, but I was raised on reading comic books and the violence here is almost the same as comic book violence. I was not at all offended. Also I felt the story line was good. But if you don't even like it after you watch it, you'll have to admit the visuals are stunning.    Brian
0141439513|4.0|I have always wanted to read this book and I am sad to say that I was spurred into reading it because I wanted to read \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\" and decided that to be fair to the humorous version of this book I should read the original.<br /><br />This was a very enjoyable book.  It starts out a bit slow as Austen has to set up all the family relations.  It takes a bit to keep all of the names thrown at you sorted out; it also takes a bit to get used to the manner of speaking used.  There are many times when a characters is trying to say \\"no\\" but they take a whole paragraph of finely crafted language to do so.<br /><br />Despite the above; the language is clever and the story (after page 80 or so) is very engaging.  I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  The plot has a lot of surprises and mis-direction and much attention is paid to characterization.<br /><br />It is not a quick read, you really have to pay attention to what you read.  But for those who like victorian stories, this story should hit the mark.  In fact this story seems to be what all the more recently written victorian fictions I have read are striving to be.  Definitely a good read if these kind of humorous victorian romances are your thing; this is the original.<br /><br />Although I don't think I will be reading a ton more Jane Austen; I did find this to be an enteraining book.  I am also looking forward to reading the spoof on it \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\\"
B001HN697M|2.0|I would like let fellow reviewers know that I do not think this film is actually \\"bad\\". If I had to rate it as a film itself, without taking the series into consideration, I would rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 as maybe a 7.     But as a fan of the series, I was very disappointed to see that this film had no surprises. The point of a series prequel is to show you how the events in the film before were set in place. You are supposed to want to watch the prequel in order to solve these mysteries and know what happened. But unfortunately, that is not what you get in this case.    By the end of the first Underworld: here is what you already should know about the history of the Vampire vs. Lycan War:    1. The Lycans were slaves to the vampires, serving as manual labor or their \\"daylight guardians\\".  2. Lucian, the leader of the Lycans, fell in love with Sonja, Lord Victor's daughter, the leader of the vampires at the time. This was forbidden. Victor had a deep prejudice of Lycans.  3. Sonja and Lucian developed a relationship, resulting in Sonja's pregnancy.  4. Victor, believing this to be an abomination, sentenced his daughter to death by massive exposure to sunlight, and Lucian was forced to watch.  5. And then, Victor decided to kill the Lycans, and Lucian rallied Lycans to his cause, and therefore, a war started.    With few details omitted, that is essentially the plot of \\"Rise of the Lycans\\", and you've only seen the first \\"Underworld\\".     It is unfortunate that the makers of this film would follow this type of formula in order to spend little money and make a quick buck. Of course if you like the series, you're going to be drawn into seeing this movie, not to mention the \\"goth-crowd\\" that loves these films. And hey, if you don't like the plot, there is always the action.    Reportedly, this to be the third film in a trilogy. Since we all knew how the war started, why not continue the story from \\"Underworld: Evolution\\"? I'd rather see what happens there.    I wasvery disappointed.
B001B7CNY2|4.0|If you're looking for historically accurate, go with Das Boot.  If you prefer something faster paced, pick up U-571.  They're both movies about submarines in WW2, but they're very, very different films.  U-571 is better than most of the crapola cranked out by Hollywood, that's for sure.
0316096199|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit I chose to read and review Alice Sebold's true crime memoir, Lucky, for personal reasons. Like Alice, I once lived a role in a true crime and have written a memoir about the experience years after the events, [[ASIN:0595530303 Luggage By Kroger: A True Crime Memoir]]. Like Alice, I have told my story in many venues, including as a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Like Alice, my memoir is about a near-fatal attack on me by a member of the opposite sex. So, when I heard about Lucky, I wanted to read it both to learn about her experience and, as a journalist, to see how she tackled the challenging responsibility of reporting it to the rest of the world.<br /><br />She didn't let me down on either count.<br /><br />Lucky recalls the story of Sebold's harrowing rape as a 19-year-old freshman at Syracuse University in 1981. More than that, however, it follows the case through the investigation and the trial.  If it were only a pure slash-and-burn true crime chronicle, Lucky really wouldn't merit much attention and likely would never have been written.  The case by itself would have been too ordinary, the investigation too simple to captivate the true crime crowd.<br /><br />As a true crime memoir, however,  Lucky emerges as a literary experience that relates the author's transition through the kind of life-defining event that can either destroy or create, depending on the memoirist's response. On that level, Sebold confirms the hype that now attaches to her name, based more on the success of her later novel, [[ASIN:0316168815 The Lovely Bones]], than from Lucky.<br /><br />Unlike me, Sebold has no difficulty identifying herself as a \\"victim.\\" She has the right, since she was an innocent victim assaulted by an unknown attacker. In my case, I knew my attacker and actually would have to admit that I went looking some of the trouble that came my way.  So, I have always been sensitive to use of the word, sensitive enough to note that Sebold used it 33 times in Lucky.<br /><br />But, her easy use of the word in recounting her story appears central to one of the key messages her powerful story can share. In its most basic theme Lucky covers her transformation from innocent victim to triumphant survivor.  She actually stopped being a victim when she decided to reclaim her life.<br /><br />Readers will find a clear declaration of that change on page 173 in this edition where Sebold recalls one crucial moment of transformation in sharing her preparation for testimony in her assailant's trial:  \\"That morning, while I dressed, I had written a note to myself on my skin. `You will die' was inked into my legs in dark blue ballpoint. And I didn't mean me.\\"<br /><br />We cannot let these people ruin our lives. We must make our stands as individuals, and collectively we must tell the bullies and the rapists and the thugs: \\"You will not rule the world.\\" That's what Alice Sebold reminds us in Lucky.Lucky.    But, her easy use of the word in recounting her story appears central to one of the key messages her powerful story can share.

B001VB8UAE|5.0|Those of us fortunate enough to have bared witness to the career of this amazing artist since the beginning, know we have been and continue to be in the presence of absolute one-of-a-kind greatness.  Those that haven't and think they know and have heard greatness, you can't even imagine.      Even if one isn't into this genre of music, you owe it to yourself to purchase this DVD and experience some of what so many of us have had the pleasure of for what's approaching now 50 years!  I tell you, you will become magnificently enlightened because there's been no other vocalist to date that can come close.  Yes, she IS that much better than any other.    You will hear the message in every song, every expression.  A message of truth and passion from an artist who must have been inside the heart of every songwriter whose songs she has interpreted through her soul and her magnificent vocal instrument.  There can be no other answer to how she is able to convey the depth and meaning of a song, all the while commanding you to listen to the lyrics and feel the meaning the way the composer had intended, and all without you even realizing it.  You will find yourself waiting to exhale after every powerful note, but the greatest power is in her ability to deliver a note so softly, so gently, as nearly a whisper--it will leave you breathless.  I'm sorry, but you don't need to scream and high-power through every song to show you can sing, like so many today.  The true artistry is in the nuances, the subtleties.    I recommend this DVD to anyone truly interested in having your heart and soul, not just your ears, entertained.  And when you're done with this magnificent selection, treat yourself to Streisand from the beginning, from Funny Girl through the years to this piece of work . . . then you too will understand what millions of us have been experiencing for nearly five decades, and why we feel we have been in the 'presence of true greatness'.
B000VFH5Z2|5.0|I am learning spanish, and listen to movies as a way to improve faster.  Being a kids' movie, this one was perfect for that purpose!  Amazon's description says it is spanish with spanish and english subtitles, so it was a pleasant surprise to discover that it also includes the options of english, and mexican spanish audio.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is learning spanish.  Even if you don't understand all of the conversations, it is a fun movie that you can watch over and over again without getting tired of it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this book! What a happy ending for all. I only wish that it didn't have to end.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|This is the best add-on accessory for a PlayStation 3 controller...period. I have nothing else to say but that it feels natural and provides great support for first-person shooters....or any game in general.  This is a great buy for $5.00 and a must for any PS3 gamer.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I rented this series from the library, and my 15 yr old daughter and I were enthralled from the moment we started. We watched the entire first disc on saturday evening, and finished the second on Sunday. We were sad to see it end. Amazing, talented cast, and characters you care about throughout. The cinematography, the sets, the costumes are all fantastic. We loved it so much we watched all the editorials at the end... fascinating how the producer, script writer, costumer, art director all worked on the series. Recommend highly!

B00002E233|5.0|the key to watching this movie is to understand its true nature. you might be tempted to watch this as a cautionary tale about the dangers of playing God, perhaps expecting Frankenstein, or Gattaca. you may also be tempted to watch this as a summer popcorn flick: big scary sharks, girl who must undress to kill said sharks, rapper/actor as shark fodder, etc. neither of these approaches is correct. you will be disappointed (thus, the various one-star reviews). you must watch this movie understanding that this is the GREATEST BAD MOVIE YOU WILL EVER WATCH. it's as if Ingmar Bergman undertook to make a porno, but decided to explore the bad qualities of the genre, instead of elevating it (like Spielberg has done for various genres). therefore, this movie is a careful meditation on really bad action films. it's ridiculous. but oh so well-crafted. there is whimsy. there is suspense. it is too clever to actually be this stupid. so you wink along and enjoy it. from the beginning it is perfectly pitched, pretending as if it were in fact a summer action movie. until Samuel L. Jackson's big scene. you know of what i speak. at that point, one is put on clear notice that this is not merely a by-the-numbers summer action movie. this is an absurd farce. but a really clever one. at that point, all bets are off. sharks move up, down, and backwards like fighter jets. helicopters are not safe from these things. the sharks actually have motivation. they are fighting for their freedom, like Che Guevera. Sharke Libre!! as for the poor humans, it is eminently obvious who will survive. but at the end, the film is like PSYCHE, B!T@H&5!! it is, at this juncture, also a pointed commentary about assuming the fate of the black guy. you ponder who the racist summer-shark-movie-watcher might be, and you look in the mirror and realize....it is I.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|this has to be the best album ever its very romantic I highly recommend it.
B001DD63UO|5.0|I was glad to find the CLEAN version of this CD for my 7 year old daughter.  I could not find it in stores.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Ok, so I'm not a music critic, I can barely pick out the different instruments as I hear them, and I have little knowledge of Nikki Sixx's history with Motley Crue so I'm probably the least qualified person to give a review except to say that when all the parts come together, the music, the lyrics, & the emotion, it's dramatic, intense, haunting, and insanely good.  Seriously, this is one of the best rock CDs I've heard in a long time, and I mean the entire CD. I can't get enough of it.     I know I'm a little late to the table; this CD's been out for nearly two years and I've only just heard the entire CD.  My first impression: it felt like I was listening to a really dark Broadway play; a rock opera... and it gets better every time I listen. The music is pure hard rock, loud, orchestral in parts, and thoroughly enjoyable. Some of the songs have a demented carnival sound to them - LOVE it! The lyrics touch you. They seem to be brutally honest and not sugar-coated. And the singing... where has this lead singer been? James Michael is outstanding in both the studio & live versions. All three members of the band are incredible and seem to gel really well together. Collectively, you can feel the range of emotions in the songs, from joy to despair. It's a pleasure to listen to this CD and I'm sure I won't get tired of it any time soon. I hope they do a follow up.  Even without the back story, the music is exceptional.
1416914307|5.0|Started reading City of Bones didn't really know if I would like the series but it was Awesome.  Clary is a 15 year old that has been more or less sheltered from her destiny because of who she is.  There is comedy, love, hate and mystery.  I could not put the books down and read all three in three days.. I promise you will be surprised and if you have a soft spot for romance you will definitely love these books.....
031606792X|5.0|This book was really amazing!!  Ever since I read twilight, I wanted to get the other books right away and not wait for them to arrive.  With this one, I was sooo excited because everything I wanted to happen happened and I got some extra in it so it was really amazing.  I finished the 754 page book in two days.  I finished the whole series in a week. I couldn't put them down until I was finished.
1596680199|4.0|I wanted to learn more about the making of clay beads.  This book is informative in both the explanations and pictures.  It gives a broad over view of the different methods to create beads and the tools needed for each technic.
0394700023|4.0|For the first half of the book, I was kind of wondering how this was an existentialist masterpiece.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't completely pointless, but it lacked depth.  I was too quick to try to clue this book out, I suppose.  Eventually, it all tied together and I could see how profound it was.      I think this is a book that warrants multiple readings and quite a deal of analysis afterwards.  I don't want to go into my own analysis too much partly because I don't think I've completely figured out what I think about it.  Do I sympathise with Meursault?  Or am I getting sucked into his perspective, his bias in the narrative?     In any case, it should stick in your mind for quite a while after reading it, as your brain picks it apart, and I think this makes it well worth reading.  It is surprisingly easy to get through anyway.  I would, however, like to dust off my French to read the original as I do wonder if the language has been simplified or dulled a little in translation.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Not to disappoint, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is all that.  As much as I wanted to see more character development, between \\"Christian Bale\\", as \\"The Batman\\", Heath Ledger did an Outstanding portrayal, as \\"The Joker\\".  ~Just when we all thought, no one could surpass Jack Nicholson's \\"Joker\\".    Harvey Dent (aka: Two~Face), was superbly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart.  Its a shame his story could not have been longer, with such a strong character, or continued into another movie, ...  Burning so brightly, yet, so short lived.      Not too often, are we treated to Two, So Dynamic a Force, So Dominant and Appealing, that they Overshadow \\"The Dark Knight\\", himself.    The scales of justice are never always fair.  We lost a character in the \\"Death of Two Face\\", and the Loss of a Great Actor, \\"Heath Ledger\\".  Hopefully, the studio's won't abandon \\"The Joker\\", in Arkham Asylum.  Instead, In my opinion:    ~Revive the \\"Red Mask\\" story, perhaps with \\"The Joker\\".  His fateful encounter with \\"The Batman\\", permanently scaring his facial features, and with another actor with a similar vocal attributes, and attitude, continue the role \\"Heath Ledger\\", so fondly developed.  I'm certain he would approve, not allowing his formidable character to disappear, within the deep, dark walls, of \\"The Arkham Asylum\\".      After all, did he not say \\"The Batman\\" could not exist without him.
0375703764|4.0|I just finished up House of Leaves last night, and I have to say, it was an enjoyable read. While the ending isn't phenomenal, the printing of the book itself is an exercise for your mind.    With overlapping endnotes and text cast in amusing fashions, it's a fun book to read, and one that you have to concentrate on.     The story of Zampano, Johnny, Navy, and the house are all fascinating. The way they are intertwined is equally interesting. As the book continues, the more bizarre everything becomes, even down to the type setting on the page. Near the end, at each page turn, you have to decipher the correct way to read the page before you can begin.    I highly enjoyed this book. The story is good, but the way he plays with text arrangement is excellent.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|My second purchase, in blu-ray, and quality not to be compared.  Robert Downey Jr. was born to the role Tony Stark, \\"Iron Man\\".  Iron Man was not my most favorite Marvel Super Hero, until I saw  the Robert Downey Jr. portrayal.      Besides, the surprise tie in, to \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" series,  \\"Iron Man\\" has so many Lives, with Nick Fury, Captain America, and a Marvel~ous World of countless possibilities, and \\"Armor\\" to boot.    Have to hand it to \\"Stan Lee\\", rising above the \\"Silver Surfer, and taking a chance, with movies of such Mature Quality.   We need Super Heroes in this day and age...  Thank You Stan.     \\"Nuff' said!!'
B001XJEKGC|5.0|Saw two out of three nights at MSG. Blind Faith was a so called \\"Super\\" Group. Perhaps, at the time, the members of the group were not on the same page musically. These shows were not the case. It was not about one out dueling the other but was about playing in unison. From their guitar styles to vocal styles this duo was meant to jam together. From Winwood sharing  a vocal turn on Forever Man to Clapton electrifying the Instrumental Glad all their musical selections those 3 nights just worked. They paid their respects to the Blind Faith album, their Golden Age and to each other. It was a \\"Super\\" Show.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This being my \\"First\\" Blu-ray purchase, and viewing, very much complimented the movie.  \\"Christian Bale~Is~The Dark Knight!!\\"    The television series entertained, as the early movies pacified my anticipation of bringing my favorite comic book hero to life.  And, along came \\"Frank Miller\\", giving \\"The Dark Knight\\" a Reality, and Life, we could only Imagine, and Respect.  A role, that seems to have been written for Christian Bale.  By far, the Best \\"Dark Knight\\" Batman.  And with a superb supporting cast; featuring:    Michael Caine, who does an excellent portrayal of Alfred, who is more than \\"The Butler\\".    Morgan Freeman, as Lucius Fox, a character who seems to be derived from the \\"Batman Beyond\\" animated series.  An essential element, to \\"The Batman's\\" creditability.    Liam Neeson, as Henri Ducard, indisputable Mentor? Nemesis?        In my opinion...  So long as this; \\"Dark Knight~Batman\\" Franchise, stays on track, not swaying to the whims of the minority of fanfare that urges \\"The Batman\\", as its predecessors (movie series), resorting to comic relief.  But, remain within the parameters of Frank Miller's Ideal Characterization.  \\"The Dark Knight~Batman\\" will survive.
1905654294|4.0|BreakingDawn is the last book of the Twilight Saga. This book is more specific and has detailed words Bella and Edward finally get married (as everyone hoped for.) Then they go to their lovely honeymoon and do grown up things. Yes, this book may have been teen rated, but sooner or later everyone will find out where babies come from. At last they then have their baby girl, Renesme.<br />  My opinion of Breaking Dawn is that it was a joy to read. It has romance, action and tense. I chose to read this book because it talks about how Bella and Edward finally got their happily ever after. I enjoyed this book very much because its very detailed,(as I said before.)<br />  When Bella and Edward are getting married they go to this island called isle Esme, where Carlisle bought Esme this island. When Bella is having her baby her pain is so much worse, that you feel it in your own. The book takes place in many places like Forks, Isle Esme and back at Forks.<br />  Bella and Edward are the main people in the story because Bella is like the damsel-in-distress and well Edward is the hunk of them all. Edwards family and the voturi are the supporting characters in this book. Alice is the smart and perky one, Jasper is the new vampire vegetarian, Emmet is with Rosalie and the tall one,and Rosalie is the beautiful but agressive one.<br />  This is the best book yet for me.
B001EO748M|5.0|ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. Stunningly well written, stunningly well acted, stunningly well directed and stunning that Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Natalie Dormer have not walked away easily crowned as the king and queen of Hollywood after their performances in Season 2.      This series is the gold standard for Henry VIII genre period movies. Subsequent to seeing The Tudors on Showtime we watched \\"The Other Bolyn Girl\\" -- my husband had the quote of the night when he said, \\"Amazing that a television show (the Tudors) could so completely outclass a full feature-length movie production.\\"     The key to success in this genre is selecting a Henry the VIII that captures the passion, youth, indulgence, willful disregard and madness of King Ocho. If you think Rhys Meyers is too youthful for the part, just take a look at the show's introductory trailor. You see a world behind those eyes and you see the knowledge of a king that was actually closer to JRM's real age during these events. In Season II, you believe he is the beloved prince-king, you buy his disgust and loyalty to Katherine (his much older queen) and you buy his infatuation with Ann Boleyn. Unlike \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" Rhys Meyers does not play the king as a gullable hard-on, but a thoughtful and emotional leader navigating demands of his cabinet, the church, France, Spain, Rome and the myriad of other characters playing chess around the crown. You see his conquest of AB as not just sexual, but also a statement to the Catholic Church and an assertion of his power. Rhys Meyers not only carries this performance, he carries the kingom. Only a truly gifted and multi-faceted actor could pull off this huge role as JRM has done without breaking a sweat.     Behind every good man... is not applicable here, because Natalie Dormer puts Ann Boleyn very much in the forefront of this series. Again, I have no idea how she is not on TMZ every evening (perhaps she does not want to be?) as an extraordinarily talented and beautiful youngactress. In this role she is neither bimbo nor bitch--but an extremely complicated woman in an unimaginable circumstance. Natalie does not overdo AB--she sells her character as tragic, attractive, manipulative and victimized. The chemistry between JRM and ND ensures the second season sizzles and explodes. The writing for the series is rich, and the delivery is flawless.    In addition to two very strong leads, this second installment in the series is flanked with textured and rich performances from all of the cast. Down to the ladies in waiting and messengers the detail in this show rivals the great big-screen classics as Godfather and Forrest Gump.     Bravo, Showtime.
074322454X|4.0|The book that I read is called Band of Brothers. It is about a group of young soldiers that serve in World War II. The book is about the things that they had to do to stay alive in the army. I like this book because it has a lot of action and soldiers that are always putting their lives at risk.
1416562605|2.0|This book is barely a novel, although it is certainly fiction.  Rather, it attempts to be a cynical expose of the deep ineradicable corruption at every level of Indian life.  In the guise of an extended communication to the Premier of China regarding the value of entrepreneurs, the narrator tells his tale of how he became a driver for a member of a landlord family whose main job duty was to deliver bribe money  to government ministers.  And then, how he murdered his employer and stole some of that bribe money and thus became an entrepreneur himself.  Just what China needs!    There are no sympathetic characters in this book -- even the narrator's grandmother tries to exploit him.  And there are is no love interest and, really, no love.  Written by a native of India, the book reeks of contempt for Indian culture with no hope or redemption in sight.  I kept asking myself: what could be the purpose of this book?  As other reviewers, mainly Indians, have made clear, as an expose, the book is light years from fair or accurate.  For a balanced view of India's economic development, I would recommend Nandan Nilekani\\"s \\"Imagining India: the idea of a renewed nation\\".  If pushed to name a redeeming value, I guess I would say I learned something about hardness of life in India's rural villages, assuming the account can be trusted.    The title :The White Tiger\\" is catchy and marketable but turns out to be a metaphor for something or somebody unusual and has nothing to do with tigers or even tiger-like qualities.  Stripped of its corruption expose core and the spurious advice to the Chinese Premier, the book is simply the tawdry tale of a scoundrel's progress, corruption layered upon corruption.  Thin gruel indeed.
0385340990|2.0|This book tries too hard to be charming, and as a result it becomes more and more contrived and thrown together as it progresses.  Voices aren't particularly distinctive for the most part, and the device of telling the story entirely through letters keeps us at a distance from the characters.  The closer I got to the end, the more my irritation grew.  I'm stunned this has so many glowing reviews.

B000002PEP|5.0|This was the first blues album I ever heard, on some budget LP in the late '70's. An ear-opening experience. The dialogue between guitar and vocal on 'Bumblebee, Bumblebee' has a kind of expansive discursiveness (with or without chemical enhancement) that can stay with you the rest of your life.    John Lee Hooker was Spiritual.  God rest him. +
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I love Star Trek. I am also a fan of Scott Bakula ('Quantum Leap').<br /><br />He looks really fantastic in the Starfleet uniform.<br /><br />Of course, I was really disappointed that ST: E was cancelled.<br /><br />This series really rocks and proves that the Trek legacy and franchise was in great hands.<br /><br />Great storylines. Great special effects. Brillant Trek all the way.<br /><br />Being set 150 odd years, before the time of Kirk and his crew's missions, was brillant.<br /><br />Showing the early obstacles that Archer and his crew must overcome, as Starfleet's first active Earth starship. Plus other encounters.<br /><br />Some encounters that will eventually to the creation of the famous Prime Directive law/s, which are discussed/debated so much in ST: TNG.<br />Not to mention the sexual contact directive/laws etc mentioned in Star Trek: Voyager. Obviously came about, after Tucker finds himself pregnant, by accident and becomes the first man in Starfleet history to do so. Great episode.<br /><br />As the title of this review says.<br /><br />IT'S STAR TREK. ENOUGH SAID!!!!!!!!
B001P9KR8U|3.0|The actors made what would otherwise have been an average film into something quite interesting. The police chief, the game show host, and the actor who played Jamal really kept it moving but Salim was not that believable.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Very well built and works much better than just using keyboard and mouse. Great to have if you are already happy with your keyboard therefore do not want to replace it with a \\"gaming\\" keyboard. Perfect addition to my Logitech G5(2007) and Saitek Eclipse II.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|I thought the lead actress was terrible, almost sleep walking compared to the rest of the cast, which might have been because she was supposed to be on drugs, but she was certainly not the fascinating actress that everyone was supposed to adore.<br /><br />And the last part of the film-if they had just finished at the Berlin Wall falling, that would have been enough. The convoluted search for the truth in the end was a bit silly. Could he not have just told him when they were at the scene of the car accident that he had done it and to watch his back and who had betrayed him?<br /><br />Otherwise, super performances, very clever film.
B001UE276A|5.0|I had the box set on pre-order for over a month and was greatly anticipating its arrival.  Having been a huge DM fan from the beginning, attending 8 previous concerts, let's just say I had high expectations.  Well, my expectations were exceeded!  The SOTU album is awesome, in my opinion their best recording ever.  The sub-bass is killer with some of the best mastering I've ever heard.  Although less than a week in my hands, it is already a DM classic in my mind.  Regarding the box set...very nice!  The extra music is awesome and the DVD is truly fun to watch.  You really get a sense of what the guys are personally like, something I've never really had any exposure to. Of course they are all extremely cool, and it was great to see their music creation process and interaction in the studio.  The books/cards/pins are all very high quality keepsakes I'm proud to own.<br /><br />I have tickets to see DM live here in Las Vegas this coming August...I'll be counting the days!
B000TGCR38|5.0|Great action, suspense, and terrific performance by all the leads make this a film that you can really get caught up in.  It is fast-paced and perhaps too many things happen one after the other so there is no breathing room in the film between her setting up Koch as her mark and then becoming his lover and going to work for the Nazis, but her acting ability is first rate and really carries the film through any little bumps.
B000002LCD|3.0|I'm not sure why but I wasn't able to put this cd into my iTunes.  What I ended up doing was ripping it using Windows Media Player, burning a 2nd cd and then using that to put the music onto iTunes.  I had to buy the whole cd just for 2 songs but I really enjoy the songs so it was worth it for me.  The rest of the cd is so so.
0307346617|4.0|Its nice to know that even in my forties, I can still enjoy the anticipation of waiting for something in the mail. Remember those $1.98 green army men that came in their own footlocker, or the x-rays specs? And when it finally showed up after an eternity, you enjoyed varying degrees of satisfaction. No the specs couldnt see through dresses (dang!), and the green army men had too many of the grenade throwing guys, and not enough of the machine gun guys.     So when this book arrived I jumped in with both feet, and when I came up three days later, I was elated! Disappointed it was over. I wanted it to continue, for Brooks had placed me into this very real world of Zack, and zed-heds, and real life characters explaining the after effects of an incredible event. This book is well-written, well paced, and doesnt degenerate into pages and pages of headshots and zombie massacres. It is a smartly written geopolitical tome, and the chapter on the Battle of Yonkers should be discussed at the Army War College.     After I was done, after 400 pages, I started outlining the sequel. Dont know is one is in the works, maybe I need to contact Max Brooks and find out. He discusses the someof the roots of the epidemic spreading (money), the initial impotence of the armed services, zombies as a fighting force, and how humans eventually stop the plague. A short but well written episode about North Korea is both chilling and accurate. Its a great book, and he fashions a universe that remains with you after the last page.  And it makes you think of other things, like how did zombies fare in desert areas? What other turning points were there? Were any areas spared contamination? How did the Internet fail /help the effort?  No matter, read the book. And if youre reading this book, youre the type of person that watches zombie movies and plays the occasional zombie video game, and you'll be right at home.  Enjoy.

1416550542|4.0|I really enjoyed the structure of this novel, which forces the reader to jump back and forth between time periods. The characters are interesting and for the most part, as the \\"mystery\\" unfolds, the author consistently surprised me. I also loved the fairy tales and how they mirrored the events of the novel. I do think the novel could have been streamlined a bit, but I was never bored reading it and I look forward to reading more by Kate Morton.
0240810961|5.0|I acquired Drawn to Life thinking it would be nice background material on typical Disney animation characters - sort of an insider's look at their production and development.  Perhaps even a way to acquire some unusual character drawings.  Wrong entirely!    What this book is, is a very specialized art instruction book aimed at animation artists and Disney animation artists specifically.  Still, it does teach focus on, and simplification of gesture in a way that can be effectively used in any medium.  Had I to reduce Drawn to Life to its barest topic, it would be just that - capturing and communicating gesture.  Animation requires special techniques adapted to 2D line drawing.  Those are the heart of the book, along with Walt Stanchfield's philosophy, optimism, and personification of Disney post-WWII history.    The book is a collection of Walt Stanchfield's weekly lectures to the Disney animators, consisting of drawing handouts and notes.  The lecture topics were, and are, essentially random (his own term) as this wasn't intended as a course of study, but as professional development and continuing ed for an existing, highly-accomplished staff of artists.  There are 149 lectures in the first volume alone, under such titles as \\"Using Cylinders\\", \\"Think First ...\\", \\"Get Out Of Your Way\\", \\"Action Analysis\\", \\"Silhouette\\", and so on.      Having dabbled in art classes and books over the years, I often find such material highly-technical ... and deadly dull.  Drawn to Life is neither.  Though the volume is large (nearly 400 pages), each lecture chapter is short and to the point.  Stanchfield's teaching style is literate and personable, often humorous and riddled with stories.  Drawings accompanying each lecture are quite loose and sketchy, invariably on-point, and amazingly convincing.  Who knew that the subtlest shift in the slant of a line could be so compelling?      I walked away with a renewed appreciation for animation artists, an enhanced vocabulary that includes terms like stretch and squish, and tools I lacked to evaluate animation quality.  Recommended, not just for artists, but for anyone intrigued by animation.  Naturally, the Disney characters and commentary sprinkled throughout are fun, too.
B000ZN802W|2.0|It's funny but most of the reviews of this movie are actually either criticisms or praise of the main character.  Without making any comment at all on the wisdom or stupidiity of Chris McCandless, I would just like to explain why I feel that, as a movie, this film simply does not work.          I read the book with great interest and delight.  I anticipated the movie giving a reality to the words and places described, but, I felt that at every turn, Sean Penn managed to disappoint.  He was far less ojective about McCandless and his family then Krakauer was in the book.  The parents are made out to be stereotypical, bougesoise, money-grubbing, semi-violent suburbanites with little or no sympathetic coverage.  This kind of portrayal was meticulously avoided by the author of the book because he clearly felt it was unjust.         The voice-over of his sister was an especially trying contrivance.  The actress has neither the voice nor emotion to pull off such an task.  Plus he clearly added material in those passages that were not in the book.  Whether true or not, they did not add to the movie in any meaningful way.        His scenes of Alaska were beautiful but the slo-mo montages got a little tiresome after a while.  He also mis-used a great soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, plugging some of the most powerful songs into meaningless transition scenes.         He spends around 10 minutes with McCandless's chance encounter with a norwegian couple just to be able to showcase the girls uninhibited attitude towards conversing with a total stranger while topless.  A bit gratuitous if you ask me.  Of all the people McCandless meets on his journey, the least important are clearly these two people.  Would Penn have found it necessary to spend as much time on this scene if the norwegian woman were, say, 55 years old and overweight.         What he left out of the book was equally vexing as what he overemphasized.  Everyone knew the ending.  Why not start off as the book does with the discovery of the body by hikers?  Why not end with the return of his parents to the bus?  Would that have humanized them too much?          Finally, at almost two and half hours, it was overly long and tedious.  It never came close to capturing the spirit of the book, despite its obvious and sometimes painful attempts to do so.  Sean Penn may be a very accomplished actor, but his directorial skills leave much to be desired.

B001HY3BFE|4.0|I'm still not sure why Saxon has never been able to make a splash in the United States? From their self titled release almost three decades ago up to \\"Into the Labyrinth\\" Saxon has produced some great rock n' roll. The latest disk to drop from this underrated band is simply awesome. Byford's vocals sound fantastic, at times launching into a vocal range only Rob Halford of Judas Priest can match, down to a gutteral growl that will remind you of Brian Johnson of AC/DC.<br />The guitar work by Paul Quinn and Doug Scarratt covers everything from 80's hair metal screech to a driving growl similiar to what you will find on Saxon's \\"Killing Ground\\" album. Nigel Glockler once again takes control of the percussion, and drives most of the tunes found on \\"Labyrinth\\" with an almost urgent rhythm.<br />Give the opening track \\"Battalions of Steel\\" a listen and you will be amazed at how the band sounds. Solid, crisp songwriting, no studio enhancement, just good old rock n' roll, played well. That's kind of a novelty itself these days....and well worth investing in.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I purchased the Bushnell Tour V2 for golf, replacing an older rangefinder which did not have Pinseeker technology.  The 5x magnification on the Tour V2 is easier to hold steady than the 6x on my old rangefinder.  The Pinseeker feature works great, too.  To get a reading on a flag, simply scan back and forth across the flag itself, and the rangefinder will show you the closest reading it gets, which is almost always the distance to the pin.      It's easy to get distance to hazards, also, using the pinseeker setting, but if you have trouble reading a certain object for some reason, you can switch off pinseeker, and use the rangefinder in scan mode, getting continuously updated distances to everything the laser sweeps across.  Good product.  I'm very happy with it.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|The extensive nudity and sexual situations (very strong and not for any children under 17) may detract from the story the first time you watch this film.  I suggest you watch it again.  The profound stories revolving around several people trying to find themselves and to cope with life are heartfelt in every way.  All lives cross in an uplifting ending that will have you feeling wonderful!
B00005JPAO|5.0|The movie was excellent... even for those of us who did not care for the way the Royal family treated Princess Di. Helen Mirren gave an Oscar winning, tasteful, believable performance. I also think the part of Philip was right on the nose. His malice and narrow minded, out of touch arrogance was perfectly portrayed in this movie. It was nice to see that his personality was not soft-soaped.<br /><br />The writing and portrayal of Tony Blair was very compelling. It seemed like most of the movie was angled from either his point of view or that of his advisers. The only problem I had with the acting on Blair's character was that the acting was a bit overdone like he was some wide eyed kid on his very first solo visit to a candy store.<br /><br />The hair wasn't quite right on Blair or Charles. It would have helped the feel of the movie if the hairdressers and makeup had done as good a job on them as they did on Helen Mirren for the role of the Queen. It would not have required much effort to comb their hair more like the persons they were portraying.<br /><br />The writers did well on all characters except Prince Charles. They didn't give the actor much to work with on lines. The writing fell flat on that character... even for Charles who's already a flat personality to begin with.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was a superb job of acting and writing.<br /><br />However, the director, Stephen Frears is an unkempt, ill-mannered, lowbrow slob in serious need of lessons in hygiene. He looks like some boozer from skid row. From his disheveled appearance, attitude, commentary and lack of personal hygiene, it is obvious that the actors and the writing team were the ones who made this movie so successful... not the director.<br /><br />It amazes me that anyone would hire this director, much less pay him a salary. All you need to do is watch the bonus material to see and hear what a swine this man is (on or off the set)... not to mention his bad manners, bad on-camera etiquette and slovenly appearance to go with his tasteless attitude. He didn't even have the decency to clean up for the DVD interview. On top of that he was frequently scratching and messing with his hair and face while on camera. He is the closest match to a human version of Homer Simpson I have ever seen. He spoke of someone looking like a clown... he should have looked in the mirror.<br /><br />Another person who had no business working on this particular film was Alan MacDonald, the production designer. He had the unmitigated audacity to declare on the bonus material interview, that the 4 billion people worldwide who were mourning Diana were all hysterical. He said it with such utter disdain and condescending attitude toward the billions of people... it was wholly offensive.<br /><br />Apparently, math and human compassion are not his forte... otherwise he would have realized that the person with the psychological shortcomings was himself... not the rest of the world. He made no contribution to this film that could not have been better done by any other production designer. Frankly, I would think twice about buying any future movie which either of these men are associated with. Their very presence spoils anything they are associated with. They would both be more at home in the low end of the adult film industry.<br /><br />But don't let that dissuade you on the film.

B00081MUY0|4.0|Sunshine Superman was Donovan's best selling album in the sixties, not least because it included the single Sunshine Superman (For John And Paul), a huge hit both in America and the UK. It marked an important turning point in Donovan's career as he had changed managers, producers and record labels, and developed his sound with the addition of a band of musicians. He also had a brilliant new arranger in the person of John Cameron, whose work on Sunshine Superman was such an integral part of the record.<br /><br />As the booklet essay describes, these changes turned out to come at a cost due to complications at the British side of the business end, as the new arrangement had been negotiated in America and had contractual complications in the UK which led to huge delays in records coming out, if at all. This seemed especially perplexing in Britain as whereas in America there was a clear change of label from Hickory to Epic, in the UK he remained on Pye.<br /><br />Sunshine Superman (For John And Paul) had been recorded in December 1965, when it was ahead of its time, but things were moving so fast that by the time it was released the following summer it already sounded as if Donovan was trying to catch up with the times, especially since during the delay Pye had been damagingly releasing older unrepresentative material on singles, such as Josie and Remember The Alamo, and when the album was released that September it was in America only. Sunshine Superman was never released in the UK in its original form, and not at all until June 1967, months after Donovan's follow-up album had been released in America.<br /><br />If Donovan had been considered to be no more than a folk singer, this album burst out of the folk confines to dumbfound those preconceptions. The songs were based on Donovan's personal experiences and observations, and included Legend Of A Girl Child Linda, about Linda Lawrence; Bert's Blues, concerning a love triangle involving Donovan, the singer Beverley and Bert Jansch; The Trip, about a jazz and folk-rock club in Hollywood where Donovan had been playing; Fat Angel, allegedly inspired by Cass Elliott of the Mamas and the Papas, and soon taken up in live performance by the Jefferson Airplane, who are name-checked in the lyric; and the brilliant Season Of The Witch, best known in the UK in its version by Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity. Most of these were recorded in Hollywood in Spring 1966 with a set of hip L.A. musicians including Shawn Phillips on sitar and Cyrus Faryar from the Modern Folk Quartet. They used an array of instruments including harpsichords, celestes and all manner of percussion, creating a palette far removed from the days of pure acoustic guitar and harmonica, and showcasing Donovan's development as a maturing songwriter, adapting and embracing change and experimentation.<br /><br />The British version of Sunshine Superman dropped three of the songs (Ferris Wheel, The Trip, Fat Angel) and substituted five from [[ASIN:B000026CET Mellow Yellow]] (The Observation, Writer In The Sun, Hampstead Incident, Sand And Foam, Young Girl Blues), which was also permanently absent from the UK release schedules, and so this CD probably marks the first time the original album has been for sale in the UK.<br /><br />Mono masters have been used throughout for the album, though among the bonus tracks is a longer stereo mix of Sunshine Superman (For John And Paul) that was prepared for the album Donovan's Greatest Hits in 1978 (available as [[ASIN:B000006YAK Donovan - Greatest Hits & More]] with extra tracks). There are six other bonus tracks including a couple of out-takes, early versions of Superlungs My Supergirl and Museum (a song he gave to the aforementioned Beverley) and finally two October 1966 demos for songs on Mellow Yellow.p, about a jazz and folk-rock club in Hollywood where Donovan had been playing; Fat Angel, allegedly inspired by Cass Elliott of the Mamas and the Papas, and soon taken up in live performance by the Jefferson Airplane, who are name-checked in the lyric; and the brilliant Season Of The Witch, best known in the UK in its version by Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity.

B000YAA68W|5.0|If you don't like subtitles than the English Dubbing is not bad. Brilliant imagery, great story, the only fallback is the film's ending. Buy it or trade for it, once you get it, you won't want to let it go. Funny, touching, beautiful.
0345350472|4.0|I found P.K Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream\\" (the actual title of the pre-film book) to be an excellent and invigorating story.  While I am usually a skeptic of the science fiction genre, this book really shattered my misconceptions of futuristic writing due to its unique plot and thought-provoking outcome.  I was particularly interested in the way he developed psychological analysis as a means for recognizing and distinguishing humanity from machine. Today, the Do Androids Dream setting seemed not-too-distant, which leaves you feeling a bit chilled after finishing the novel.  My only qualm was with the opening chapters-- the story did not really make any sense for me until 50 or so pages in.
B000055Y0X|5.0|You must have a good understanding of humor and satire to watch this movie. Kubrick is very delicate with the material and satire, not as discreet as American Psycho or as openly funny as American Beauty, but this movie has a dark bite to it that can keep you laughing on 4th, 5th, and 6th viewings. I am currently getting ready for sevenths. This film has 2 great reasons to admire Peter Sellers, a couple of great reasons to applaud the serious Slim Pickens and of course the marvelous George C Scott. This is a movie that only gets better with age and launched a new face for comedy. A must buy for a lover of film, comedy, and war.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I have to admit I had my fingers crossed when I ordered this package.  I had my fingers crossed because I had read some extremely negative reviews about The Godfather Director's Restoration here at Amazon.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that my experience is the direct opposite of those negative reports.<br /><br />The colors are beautiful.  The lighting is perfect.  The audio if flawless.  The music is faithfully reproduced.  Even the subtitles included words and word parts which I had never picked up before.<br /><br />Francis Ford Coppola's  commentary tracks added immensely to my enjoyment and understanding of the three Godfather movies.<br /><br />The special features (most of which I had not seen before) were both fun to watch and instructional.<br /><br />All the effort the Mr. Coppola and his team put into this restoration project is rewarded in the final result.  The price I paid was quite a bargain considering what I got.<br /><br />I recommend this product hightly to anyone who has an interest in the Godfather movies and also to anyone who has an academic interest in experiencing what a world class \\"Director's Restoration\\" can accomplish.<br /><br />Ignore the negative reviews.  Enjoy this gift from the Coppola family to us.
B00260HH3K|2.0|Fans of the original Dragon-Ball franchise who have been drawn to the series distinct humor will find disappointment in Dragonball: Evolution. Goku who has been friendly strong and kind in the show has now become a whinny invert school-boy that gets picked on in classes. Chichi has gone through a total personality change as well, from a bossy loud-mouth to an over-friendly popular rich airhead that falls heads over heels for Goku almost instantly. Goku punches Chichi in the movie by 'accident'. It was surprising how she was so calm and 'forgiving' about being knocked out. The fact is that in the anime Chichi had to run after Goku to grab his attention, not the other way around. Bulma has also gone through a personality change and had it not been for the two blue strands of hair and actually saying her name she would have been unrecognizable with the exception of the machines. Yamcha has completely lost his fear of women and instead is like a lousy fill-in sand dune wannabe cool guy. Piccolo, instead of being the unique bad-guy with split personalities has become just the \\"bad-guy\\". He has totally lost his antenna's and pointy ears as well being reduce to a incomplete villain that just sends out his chick to do all his dirty work. Where are the rest of the characters? Where's Launch, Krillin, Yamcha's floating cat buddy, Tien and Chichi's oversized strong-as-an-ox father and others? Heck, even the dinosaurs are missing except for the giant eggs-scene at the very beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Another disappointment is the fight-scenes. They are pretty linear in concern of action-fullfilling. A lot more of doing cool, swirly hand-signals and gun pointing/zapping than fights. And what has happened to Gohan's extension pole? It's not even included.<br /><br />Goku turning into a Oozaru was pretty lame too. Instead of being the size of King-Kong he's normal height with no tail. All he has to do is to \\"believe in himself\\" and he'd return back to normal, which is not how it goes! The most disappointing of them all was the fight with piccolo, the Kamehameha (not 'Kameha' like the movie says) is supposed to be a gigantic ball of energy shot towards the opponent. Instead it has been reduced down to a stream of wisps when Goku lunges at Piccolo. When Master Roshi 'dies' the summoned dragon is a dwarfed,speechless,golden' glow version of the impressive original. No black ominous skies. Just a chopped, quick cameo with some cracking-noises, wind and lighting in broad daylight.<br /><br />Some scenes are just down-right corny they are laughable. Why is piccolo being taken care of by chicks? What happened to the little-girl hiding under the destroyed village? Why is it that both Bulma and Chichi want to make out with the guys just like that? Fans of the original, stay away from this rushed-out preview. The OVA movies are way better in the way that they can be viewed with or without the series.e most disappointing of them all was the fight with piccolo, the Kamehameha (not 'Kameha' like the movie says) is supposed to be a gigantic ball of energy shot towards the opponent.

B0002RQ2T4|4.0|The film receives the highest possible figure on any scoring system from me.  From the smooth and vibrant animation, the well developed characters and smooth pacing, the great direction and the atmosphere it creates, the stunning suggestions of the future and their execution,  the action and the intrigue, and of course the philosophical musings and the concepts they explore with quite a bit of depth..it's all near perfect.    This particular DVD release of said film gets a 4/5.  There are some very good things about this package, but there are also some very glaring flaws.  You would think Manga Entertainment would give the utmost care to any and all releases pertaining to such an acclaimed and important film.  That they wouldn't have very bland disc art or flimsy image quality on the free poster inside.    But they do.  The discs are horrid looking.  It's quite a shame, since the rest of the packaging is quite nice.  The digipak is shimmery and attractive and the slipcase around it eye-catching.  The disc content itself is very nice, the menus do not disconnect from the mood of the film.  The extras are quite dated compared to the film,  but that's one of the reasons why the film is great.  There's lots of extras here, but the second disc's space is mostly taken up by an elaborate maze of advertising.    The new cleaned up version of the film is done quite well.  What's new?  Nothing is inserted, nothing is altered.  The color and sharpness is enhanced and film spots are taken away.  Purists take no fear, it is the original film with slight enhancements for the better.  Should you buy this?  Only if you can't stand to wait for a better edition to come (which is only eventual given the historical importance of GITS).  It's quite perfect for those die-hards who really can't wait, because the new transfer really does look kickass on the home screen.
0553278398|1.0|To start, I want to say that I am a big fan of the Foundation Trilogy.  I read it while I was growing up, and it had a major influence on me:  the concept of Psychohistory, and the focus on social movements and structures instead of individual \\"great men\\" was both fascinating and rare.  I borrowed this book a few months ago from a friend, and now have read it twice.  I think it is simply horrible writing.  The characters are bland and sterile, the plot is simply an excuse to connect up threads from the other series - and it is done in a rough and unsubtle way.  The story winds from one location to another - with no purpose or reason, except to connect to the history from the previous robot novels.    In some ways, this novel reminds me of the even-more-repulsive Star Wars prequels in 3 major ways:    1.)  They are a poor addition to the storyline, the quality is much lower than the originals (minus the Ewoks, of course)  2.)  They are clearly based on the idea of an existing fan base wanting to have details filled in and the publisher counting on this for sales even if the quality level is low.  3.)  The social structures, customs, attitudes, and cultures are overly simplistic, unimaginative, and based sterotypically on current day earth.    On this last point, I had to shake my head when I read about the cultures of Mycogen and Dahl - along with the fact that tens of thousands of years in the future, the plot hinged on soldier not being willing to follow a woman as a leader.  Mycogen with its unimaginative taboos, and then Dahl with its 50's-style morality (and hyper-simplistic social stratum). Top it off with the unlikely scenario that \\"Aurora\\" and \\"Earth\\" cultures have survived is even somewhat recognizable forms - AND ON TRANTOR AS WELL!!! That's just too silly to even consider.      The social stratum in Dahl requires even more criticism ... of course Seldon has to find a \\"diamond in the rough\\" among the Heatsinkers: one who does manual labor, but has a Ramanujan-like mathamatical ability - in order to show Seldon's nobility and his ability to see past social class, unlike the \\"silly\\" Dahlites.  Compare the projected social structures here to those of Herbert in Dune, or even to those created by Asimov himself in the Robot or Foundation Trilogies, and you will see that here Asimov paints poorly, and with a very rough brush at that.  I agree with one of the 2-star reviews that Asimov is at his best when focusing more on the conceptual level, like in the Foundation Trilogy, although he did succeed with the characters in the Robot novels (though I haven't read them in quite a while.)    It is too bad really - I went to the reviews here expecting Asimov readers to be more discerning and honest with themselves, as opposed to lapping up anything with the \\"Foundation\\" label on it.

B001K98MFK|5.0|Splendid justice, Bandai to the rescue!  Anyone more than familiar with Innocence knows about the botched Dreamworks dvd.  Many have complained about them, and for good reason.  They had Closed Captioning only, no dub (if there were, it would've been less of an issue), and really bad cover art.  Then Bandai comes in (years later) and gives us treasure.  Everything is beautiful.  When they say Special Edition, Bandai means it with total honesty.    The packaging is a nice tin box with gorgeous artwork on both sides, the front a painting from a surreal scene towards the end of the film, the back what I believe to be original art for this release.  There are 2 discs : The first is a filled-to-the brim version of the film, with 2 dubs (one of which the UK Dub, one of which the new US Dub done exclusively for this release).  I'm glad they decided to include both, and any other anime company wouldn't of.  Each Dub has their own good and bad points.  They also have audio commentary from Oshii himeself (with subs), a Making Of, and the Japanese theatre trailer.  The second disc is the soundtrack (a great bonus to anyone who appreciates the film itself).    And speaking of the film itself, lets get to that.  Innocence is underrated, and I think it receives lots of unwarranted hate.  I think it's a beautiful film, and not just because of the amazing animation.  The atmosphere, the philosophy, the direction...It's all beautiful.  I get shivers during several of the scenes.  There's a lot of silent scenes here and the look is the closest you'll get to an independent film sensibility in an anime work.  It's the perfect sequel, it doesn't try to outdo at all.  The animation is done in a completely different way, and the story is simply a complement and a means of further fleshing out the universe left behind at the first film's climax.    The dubbing is well done.  The UK Dub does well with the Harraway scene, the Kim scene, and any scene with motoko.  The scenes with motoko in the UK Dub are mystical and I enjoy their re-writes here.  Nowhere else do I, however.  They turn good writing into cliche'd garbage and add in generic shouts where there was none initially.  Batou is much too gruff, it's ridiculous.  The US Dub has Batou perfect, much softer, much more somber.  The final scene with Motoko is good for reasons other than the UK dub, the emotion put into the voicework is really involving when the two meet.  The script shows little to no deviations.    Bandai swooped in like a super hero and gave the film a cared for, fitting release which it always deserved.  This is a must own edition, and even if a new one comes along, I can't imagine how it could be better.  There is no hesitation to buy this, especially after such a long miserable period where the only available dvd of the movie was crap.  If you show an appreciation for this film at all, and wonder if you should upgrade if you own the last version : Do it.  You'll enjoy the whole package.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|very good in a fast moving way. i never got bored watching it. the only thing i would like to see is women on bikes because as a woman biker and I beleave there should be some in the show because women are all over the states on cycles.but the show has more realitic types of people there not all skinny and beautiful. i really think thats great. so many shows today have to many skinny beautiful people. what does that say for the real people? that we dont look the way we should. so great job with the people choice for the show.if you like bikes and action this is a show to watch. i am more then ready for the next season.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I am on to my 8th listen of the album and it is becomning clearer to me what really bothered me about PTA is what makes SOTU sound mediocre at times. It's really the same producer, very similar outcome. It is far better album than Exciter. But that is not nothing to write home about. The material on the album have a lot of potential unfortunately Alan Wilder is not here for the rescue. My personal fav. tracks are: Wrong, Fragile tension, Corrupt, Jezebel, Perfect, Miles Away. Least fav. are: In Chains, In Sympathy, Come back.   1. In Chains (2/5): great vocals by Dave, music is overproduced, this should have been probably a B side. The worst starting song on a DM album ever (maybe beats Exciter but I don't own that album)  2. Hole to Feed (3/5): great beat, great vocals by Dave, unfortunately bad producer.  3. Wrong (5/5): Masterpiece, outstanding vocals by Dave/Martin, great complex beat, thanks for an incredible hit  4. Fragile Tension(5/5): Masterpiece, outstanding lyrics, very beautiful beat/music, simple yet layered sounds, great vocals by Dave  5. My little soul(4/5): nice song, good lyrics snd good vocals by Dave/Martin  6. In Sympathy(2/5): good beat, aweful lyrics, OK singing by Dave  7. Peace(3/5): very nice lyrics, another great singing by both Dave & martin, it is an OK song though.  8. Come back(2/5): I hope this song goes away, lol should have been a B side, really a bad song. NOt even Dave's vocals can save it  9. Spacewalker(3/5): OK instrumental filler  10. Perfect(5/5): another great song, great lyrics, very retro sounding  11. Miles away/The Truth is (4/5): great lyrics/vocals, good sound, waiting for the remixes!!  12. Jezebel(5/5): Martin's only ballad on SOTU, and his best since Ultra (Home), enough said, very beautiful, good job Martin  13. Corrupt(5/5): another great song, Dave at his best, incredible complex lyrics about relationships (DM cliche). This is the best closing song on an album since Higher Love on SOFAD.

0374531269|4.0|From the outset it was a given that the write was going to be \\"drafted.\\" After all, the subtitle is \\"Memoirs of a Boy Soldier.\\" The suspense was in seeing how it would happen, and at whose hands.  Somehow I expected it to happen suddenly and against all logic, but when it did it made sense in a sick way.  It seemed a duty and there didn't appear to be any alternative to taking up arms.  This book tells a true story of survival, misery, degradation and restoration.  It will shock sheltered Westerners who have never seen life beyond their secure borders and outside their relatively stable political systems.  Hopefully, though, it will also anger, encourage and inspire people to take informed action on behalf of people in war-torn territories around the world.

It, then, should be no surprise why this books are some of the best selling of all time. And yet, it is disheartening to see some people take the book so seriously--it is a work of fiction people. Fiction. The intrigue and mystery are merely bonus elements in the prose. If there is only one book you read, make it Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I really enjoy purchasing this movie through Amazon. It cost me less than what I would pay at WAL-Mart, even with the shipping.
B0001CCXZW|3.0|I recieved the dvds in great time, BUT there were two disc 2s and no disc 1...so I was pretty disappointed. You can't really start off a series with \\"previously on Gilmore Girls\\".
B000CNFC76|2.0|After seeing this film on the golf channel, I got the book it was based on by Mark Frost. As an avid golfer, the gulf between book and film was beyond cavernous. Forgettng about the brilliant dealings with cultural milieu, which is the one disagreement I have with some complaints here (the class differences are integral to the story), the movie does a terribly inadequate job of recreating the extraordinary sporting accomplishment and thrilling duel that led to Ouimet's victory.    How such an enthralling true life event could be so messed up is beyond me. As others have pointed out, the backstory of Ouimet's early success (he won the Massachusetts' Amateur that summer)is almost completely deleted. The idea that he was forced to give up the game never happened and it is even more ludicrous to paint him as almost a rank but talented beginner who had to intensify practice before a tournament as great as the Open Championship in order to compete. The real crux of the story lies in Ouimet's fantastic comeback on the back nine to tie the two legendary greats after freezing and throwing away a five shot lead, needing a two under par in a downpour: with a chip in!! (magically changed to beautiful sunlight in the film -same day-huh?) to accomplish his goal.  That the incredible thrill ride of real life could be dampened by this Disneyfied cinematic account is something I can't fathom. The direction and conception here is awful and mangles what could have been greatness. I think their Hollywood desires to make the playoff the climax (which was 18 holes, not 36 and won rather handily by Ouimet-3 strokes, although Vardon's attempt to trick him did occur on that day) overode their ability, however feeble it was, to weave the great drama with the playoff into a better fabric. Thus much of Ouimet's greatness of achievement and real sense of stirrring adventure was lost.    After reading many comments here I concur that the insertion of the \\"romantic\\" element forced other importantstories out of the picture, mainly McDermott and Hagen. The scenes with Reid make no sense unless you've read the book. Take away the girl and Reid, focus more on McDermott, Hagen, and the reality of Ouimet's temperament and experience, yet lack of it,(with the American obsession and anguish for a champion), focus more on the real golf drama and the film goes up three notches.    Very few golf stories, especially those of the premodern era, before everything is on some form of tape or recorded, lend themselves so readily to dramatic recreation as this one. That the film's creators were not up to the task, that this could have been something much more than a sanctified family film comes close to a tragedy.    That the event itself, revealing itself so well in Mr. Frost's book, is truly such an amazing one shines past all these faults to make me want to see it again. But that only makes me sadly think of what might have been.    The analogy is to the cartoon version of Lord of the Rings by Bakshi vs Peter Jackson's towering achievement years later.  There is no comparison. At least the film pushed me to read the book, and to open my eyes to the wonder of this amazing feat that unfolded as a real life fairy tale and wonderous accomplishement that occurred so many years ago.    And by the way Seabiscuit the movie for me carried the same disappointment in relationship to the book upon which it is based. These Hollywood filmakers seem consistently unable to make a great sports movie. Only a very few seem to pass the test. (\\"Hoosiers\\", others) Less achieve greatness as cinema (Think \\"The Hustler\\" or \\"Raging Bull\\".)  The rest constantly trade in on sappiness.    P.S. I just got the DVD from the library after reading Frost's amazing book. That led me to revise this review. The film was unwatchable after the powerful craft Frost brought to the story, principly in the unfolding of the tourmament play itself. I remember vividly when I was twelve years old, having deeply immersed myself in Greek mythology. I went with friends to see a \\"Hercules\\" movie, cubbed in English starring Steve Reeves. Instead of the awe inspiring story I expected, I was treated to garbage. I nearly threw up. But my friends thought it was cool.    The Greatest Game...is a much more sincere effort and much more serious attempt yet as I have pointed out, to this movie watcher it is a terible failure. To anyone who watched this year's Masters, and the incrediblle excitement created by Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson for two hours, can you genuinely say this movie came anywhere near those heights? Yet THIS  STORY , especially as recounted by Frost, was far, far greater than this year's event.    Great moments in history deserve storytellers who can match them. Since that is my profession, perhaps I am more sensitive and attuned than most. Read the book to really get it, if you wish. Though a nice try, this film gets C- at best. And that's a shame for such a tremendous true life tale.
0061478784|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me a few years before Miyazaki's adaptation hit theaters (meaning before it hit super popularity). I fell in love with all of the characters and the world they inhabited. I won't drone on, but needless to say that I recommend this book to anyone looking for a meaningful and imaginative book, one they can escape to and enjoy time and time again.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|\\"The Reader\\" isn't exceptional only for Kate Winslets' show-stopping performance (though I do rate her performance in 1999's underrated 'Hideous Kinky' better than this), but also for the fact that someone had the nerve to think up a story such as this. On the face of it, this is a slow, plodding film that bases itself entirely upon dialog and low-budget sets, but dig deeper and its a rich tapestry of interwoven storylines that span three eras.<br /><br />While other reviews may give you glimpses of the storyline, my review is to alert you to the fact that this is an 'adult' film, not because of the nudity, but because of the themes involved. Winslets' character Hannah is certifiably a villain, but one is left feeling rather sorry for her character. Then you remind yourself that the character is a dumb spoke in the wheel of mass genocide and you are rocked back to your senses.<br /><br />Especially telling is the court-martial segment, when it is clear that Hannah has no remorse over what shes done, simply because she does not consider it wrong. For her, life is just duty and honor to ones' employers, and she carries this rigid and horrifying attitude to her grave. However, there is also a softer side to her, where she likes classic literature read out to her, and she seems to enjoy nature and freedom. The movie seems to pose a very valid question and statement both at the same time - I bet intellectuals, especially Holocaust scholars have had numerous discussions about this films' subject matter, because it really makes you think.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes was sort of the weak link here for me, as he seemed to be sleepwalking through his ill-written role. The script sagged in the second half, especially so in the all-so-important 'reunion' scene, which came and went without much fuss. Perhaps that was the intent. Either way, this is a film that starts off bursting with potential, but somehow along the way deflates into a rather mediocre statement on the lives of Post-Holocaust criminals.<br /><br />At the center is a lovely performance by Kate Winslet, who clearly has matured as an actress. The young lead (an 18 year old playing a 15 year old) deserves special mention. But this is very much an 'actress-driven' film, and if at all you have been interested in World War II, Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, and the 'final solution', this is the perfect film for you to indulge in even more reflection over that damned piece of human history.<br /><br />Certainly not a masterpiece, but a very, very solid piece of work. As far as I'm concerned there are only four feature films that could classify as Holocaust 'masterpieces':<br /><br />1. \\"Schindler's List\\" (Steven Spielberg)<br />2. \\"Holocaust\\" (3-Hour TV Movie starring Meryl Streep, out now on DVD)<br />3. \\"Shoah\\" (The Definitive Holocaust Documentary, 11 hours long, and out of print on DVD)<br />4. \\"Sophie's Choice\\" (Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline - a true classic)<br /><br />Four Stars.At the center is a lovely performance by Kate Winslet, who clearly has matured as an actress.

1933771690|2.0|It is beyond dispute that Dr. Lanza is a brilliant researcher, which is why I so anticipated reading this book. However this is not the rigorous summation of his hypothesis of a consciousness driven universe that I had hoped it would be. In fact, his arguments are even weaker here than I have perceived them to be in his previous writing on the subject.    It's not just the apparently sloppy editing: a photon in one sentence becomes an electron in the next; an illustrative tale about a hare chasing a tortoise suddenly becomes about a tortoise chasing a hare. The real problem is the lack of consistent logic in the writing of such an accomplished scientist.    On the one hand Dr. Lanza makes an appeal to intuition to discredit the Big Bang theory by saying that an entire universe appearing suddenly, ex nihilo, is simply at odds with common experience. But he then goes on to assert that the kitchen disappears from physical reality when you turn out the lights and go to bed. The kitchen isn't there unless observed by a conscious entity.    How everyday experience and intuition can discredit one claim about something so generally mystifying as the origin of the universe and substantiate another claim about the temporal existence of a surpassingly more mundane kitchen is an absurd basis for rational argument.    Sorry to say, this isn't science at all but just more New Age mysticism given apparent credibility by a man of great accomplishment in another field of inquiry entirely.

0440178002|5.0|I've just finished Shogun by James Clavell. The book is a bit long (1200+ pages) but it's a terrific read. The plots and subplots are excellent. The characters' development, the Japanese culture, the conflicts between the Japanese and the European cultures, between the Catholics and the Protestants, the spread of Christianity in Japan, etc. are vividly described. And there're lots of samurai (and ronin and ninja) battles.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|It seems there is a split among fans of Depeche Mode's new album. I can kind of see both sides. When I first purchased the album, I was not blown away by any tracks on the first listen. The album started to grow after listening to it all day though. By the end of the week, I loved the album. To me, it is a combination of both worlds... the old days (vintage synths) mixed with songs that remind me of Ultra. I believe that there is something there for all fans. I place it above Exciter and Playing The Angel. I enjoy the mood of the album, especially the latter, and the lyrics. My favorite song on the album is In Sympathy! Give this album a try =)
B001N26GFM|3.0|\\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is a Holocaust movie from an intriguing point of view: that of an eight year-old boy. Bruno witnesses acts that must seem bizarre to a child who is struggling to comprehend that adults--even one's own father--can be evil. The proximity of innocence makes the acts of cruelty even more nauseating, even if they aren't of the same epic scope of \\"Schindler's List\\" or \\"The Pianist\\". Bruno is the very embodiment of curiosity, and luckily he questions the judgment of those who should know better.        He moves into the country near a concentration camp and befriends a young boy who is supposedly the \\"enemy\\". But instead of pandering to racist rhetoric and being influenced by brainwashed Nazis, he comes to his own conclusions. Is the Jewish boy evil? Has he done anything mean to Bruno? Gradually Bruno realizes that his world is surrounded by lies--the internment camp is not a happy place, the shaved-head boy is not a grubby rodent, and perhaps his father's weaselly smile is hiding something sinister. In fact, Bruno proves to be less of a loyal friend than his imprisoned counterpart, denying knowledge of their friendship, which ultimately torments him and perhaps takes the first painful step toward building his conscience. If the movie had adhered to this formula, it would have been miraculous. But it takes a strange twist at the end...       WARNING SPOILERS HEAD! ACHTUNG! CUIDADO!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY WATCHED THE MOVIE! YOU THERE!! THE ONE DROOLING ALL OVER HIS KEYBOARD AFTER MY REVIEW SENT HIM INTO A STATE OF CATATONIA...OR IS IT NARCOLEPSY? AT LEAST THEN THERE WOULD BE A MEDICAL EXCUSE FOR SOMEONE FALLING ASLEEP WHEN READING THIS...ANYWAY...  ...that seems out of synch with the rest of the movie. The movie builds quietly, with subtle skill, then becomes overwhelmingly tragic. The slow-burning tone erupts into a cataclysm. I am at a loss to understand the director's intent. Or, since this movie is based on a children's book, I am confused as to the author's motivation. Is it that the sins of the father are eventually paid upon his son? Bruno sneaking into the camp certainly reveals his character's sense of adventure, and trying to find his friend's father reveals a desire to seek atonement for his recent betrayal, but the ending still seems murky. Is Bruno's father going to renounce the horrors of anti-Semitism after stumbling upon the body of his son, who has choked on Zyklon-B? Is it an accusation against the mother, who knows that her husband is presiding over hell, yet refuses to steal his children away from him? Is Bruno the sacrificial lamb, suffocating on toxic vapor so his sister will learn a lesson? Am I reading too far into this? Does every movie need to have a profound message? Am I too dumb to fathom it?        The very fact that I have so many questions makes me suspect the ending was emotionally powerful but logically muddled. The heavy-handedness of it actually took away some of its emotional impact. I was more moved by Bruno's guilt over betraying his friend than I was when he huddled in the shower stall, waiting for a cascade of water that became lung-drowning cyanide. Bruno didn't have to die for the movie to be heartbreaking. His death only makes me scratch my head and wonder why a generous, kind-hearted boy has to strangle to give the film validity.
015206396X|4.0|I agree with most previous reviewers. This is an excellent book that holds your attention and makes you long for a sequel. A couple of additional points:    1. Those complaining that this is a \\"mature\\" book obviously haven't read much young adult fiction lately. The sex is this book is barely perceptible. OK, so she decides to have sex and doesn't want to get married, but Cashore doesn't use profanity or details whatsoever and clearly the two characters are deeply in love.    2. I really enjoyed the book, but two parts of the plot were just too \\"neat\\" for me. First, as Po and Katsa cross the mountain, they just happen to see King Leck right away, just as he kills the queen. Too convenient. Second, the fact that Katsa walks in on Leck in Po's castle and kills him within a page. WAY too convenient. Cashore spent pages describing the crossing of the icy mountainous pass, but only 1/2 page killing off the main evil character!    Despite these minor flaws, the story was very readable and held my attention. I definitely recommend it to the high school set (and adults who are medieval-fantasy lovers.)
006112429X|5.0|This highly original novel addresses a hot topic - school shootings.  But this is nothing like Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes, which is fluff compared to We Need to Talk About Kevin.  It is a brutally honest account of a mother's struggle to understand her son's violent actions.  The structure of the novel is letters that Eva is writing to her husband in an attempt to justify why Kevin has turned out the way he has.  From his conception through his early childhood and adolescence, Eva toils over her memories of Kevin and their turbulent relationship, constantly wondering what she could have changed to affect the outcome.  It depicts a deeply troubled boy who, from day one, seems to have been \\"a bad seed.\\"<br /><br />While it took me a few chapters to get acclimated with Eva's voice and Shriver's style, once I got going I couldn't stop.  It is an undeniably smart piece of fiction and contains intensely powerful character studies: a mother trying to balance career, parenthood and all that comes with a successful life and a son who is severely unhappy boy who does not fit the stereotypical profile of a school shooter (loner, bullied, etc.).  This book is not for everyone due to its depictions of violence and its somber tone, but it deserves attention for Shriver's brilliant writing and command of the subject.
B00009ZYBY|3.0|There is a fight scene in this film where Russell Crowe takes on about 6 opponents. Dispatches them easily until he gets to the last one who he disarms and impales with two swords either side of his victims chest, who stands there stunned mortally wounded but not dead yet. Crowe stops, looks at him,his head cocked to one side with a slightly rye expression on his face quickly pulls out both swords and decapitated his victim to the roar of approval from the crowd. Incensed he throws one of the swords narrowly missing a high ranking member of the audience and screams at the populace in the amphitheatre \\" Are you entertained\\"? Well yes, for all the wrong reasons. And for the same reasons why this genre was rightly discontinued about four decades ago it fails to engage outside of the fight scenes and cannot be taken seriously. Good fun though. Average aged pitched at for content I would put slightly below 15. (One performance to watch this film for is the characteristically over the top Arab slave trader and ex-champion gladiator played by the late Oliver Reed. At one point he accuses an inn landlord of selling him \\" queer giraffes\\" because he couldn't get them to mate. Only laugh out loud joke of the film though.)
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie is, by far, on my list of favorites!  Delightfully done, and even heart-tugging.  My grandchildren even enjoyed it, so you see it IS a family hit.  I hope when it is watched, everyone takes the time to see the video at the end of the song \\"When You Taught Me How to Dance\\".  It too may bring tears to your eyes, but also a smile because of its tenderness.  You will just want to hear it again and again.

I.I. is not the easiest read (find a quiet room, have a notepad and paper, and read 1 or 2 chapters a night), but its insight is breathaking--particularly with the financial chaos (and volatility) of recent months. I've long been a fan of Warren Buffet and a Value Investor, and decided to read this book after reading of its influence on his style. If you have any desire to \\"run your own money\\" and self-direct your investments, you are a fool to not read this book. If you choose to not do it yourself (and nothing wrong with that choice, it takes ALOT of time), take Graham's prescient advice and simply place your money in stock and bond Index Funds and simply own the entire market.

B0000630YA|5.0|In my opinion, \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" is easily the best thing he did up to that point and for quite a few years after. Catchy songs, dark humor, more hard rock/metal than his earlier efforts. There's not really a bad song on the album. There's a reason no one has rated this album 1 or 2 stars yet, it's just that good. This album HAS to have been a big influence for King Diamond.

This was one I couldn't put down. I know I will re-read this, and I don't do that with many books. I did get alot out of it mainly from the first 2 sections. Makes me want to start meditation!

1400034779|5.0|I started watching the HBO series and loved it so I ordered the first book.  It's fantastic and I'm so glad HBO is sticking so close to the author's vision.  Loved the book and I'm upset at myself for not ordering the second in the series until I finished the first one because now I'm without a book to read.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  I was also suprised that a man could write a woman's part so well.
B001E0FRD0|4.0|I gave it only four stars due to poor writing style but what an unbelievable account of what our armed forces have done and are doing. I was continually amazed by the bravery and determination of the unit in the battle.    I did have problems with the writing style and editing. Examples: In Coronado you can't see the sun rising over the ocean since the sun rises in the east. The airport in San Antonio is on the San Antonio River, not the Colorado River. If he had landed in Austin though instead of San Antonio, then he would have been on the Colorado. I also believe he had some dates wrong in relation to Operation Iraqi Freedom but it had no bearing on the book.    Regardless, I highly recommend this book for anyone who appreciates the military and who understand what it means to be a patriot and a real American. Many reviewers are critical of the amount of time Luttrell spends writing about his training, but since this book is in many ways an autobiography, I have no problem with this. It makes the reader better understand how a person could get through what he and his team faced.

I am now on the third book and very much enjoying the series.

B000021XR5|5.0|This album seems to get the least amount of praise of the first 4 albums. It's been a while since anyone has reviewed this, but I haven't changed my thinking since I first heard it in 1999. The first 4 songs starting with \\"Down\\" thru \\"Church on Tuesday\\" rip like nothing else from STP. These tunes are so downright heavy you hope the speakers just blow out of the cabs. And then...\\"Sour Girl\\", STP's finest moment. Light, breezy, incredible vocal performance, almost the perfect pop song. There are fine moments beyond the first 5, but these songs are worth the price of admission. If you was listening to \\"Atlanta\\" from another room, you would swear Jim Morrison was in the house. I remember STP getting unjustly dumped on by the critics when Core came out. When Purple was released, I think it is fair to say the joke was on the critics. I saw these guys in concert in '96, and though Weiland might have had issues at the time, they still cranked out the best performance I have ever seen. I am hoping for a new album from them, the 2008 tour was encouraging. There really hasn't been anything as solid since except maybe the Foo Fighters, speaking from a Gen X perpective who grew up on Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, and later on-Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and STP. All of STP's albums are spectacular, but this one jumps out at me as their finest.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|As a pretty die-hard Depeche Mode fan, I have to say that I am very disappointed with this latest album.  The songs are all over the place with no musical chorus, hooks or anything else for that matter.  The lyrics sound like a 4th grader could make them rhyme, and it seems as if they just went crazy experimenting with their synthesizers and decided to record whatever they came up with.  \\"Playing the Angel\\" was far superior in every way to this trash, very dissapointing.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|I was there, in 2006: Barbra in Las Vegas.  And again in 2007, in Berlin, Dublin and London.  Four wonderful concerts - and finally the DVD is here. It's everything I hoped for - and more. Barbra's simply brilliant: she's in great voice, sings songs she hasn't sung in ages and is very, very relaxed: she really seems to be enjoying herself.  This (Florida)concert is very close to what I saw in Vegas and Europe. The Bush skit is missing - many people don't mind, but I would have loved to have seen it here - even as a bonus.  The quality of this DVD is amazingly good. it has been shot in HD/widescreen and it shows. Both the picture and audio look and sound great, although this version of the concert is completely blown out of the water by the Blu-ray edition - but that's a different story.    Highly recommended - for the casual fan, the hard-core fan (like me) and anyone who simply enjoys great music - and a great performance.    Oh - and the Anaheim '94 disc, plus the bonus Making of the Broadway Album are more than icing on the cake. The Anaheim show features one of Barbra's greatest performances ever, while The Broadway album is one of Streisand's top albums - ever!    Siep

Kidman & Jackman have no chemistry; the kid is the most interesting character in the film; and at least 5 times you think the film is over--and then it isn't. It's not god-awful; its just way too long and uninteresting to give it nearly 3 hours of your time. If you want to watch a GREAT movie about Australia get \\"Quigley Down Under\\" with Tom Selleck.
0751529818|5.0|This is a great book without the need for further introduction. The main theme about this book revolves around learning how to die in order to live well, to love and to be loved. It also covers marriage, community, material possession and handling of our emotion. The following is the main gist of what I have learned from this book.<br /><br />We must learn how to die in order to live well.<br />We must learn how to give out love, and to let love come in. Death ends a life, but it does not end love or a relationship.<br />We must actively seek the meaning of our life. Do the kinds of things that come from the heart.<br />The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives purpose and meaning.<br />When you do, you won't be dissatisfied, you won't be envious, and you won't be longing for somebody else's things.<br />We shouldn't hide our emotion, we should let emotion flow. We should cry or mourn when we need it.<br />We need to mourn or feel sad. But don't hang on to that emotion for too long; after that we need to focus on the good things in our life.<br />Culture is not necessary right, if necessary create your culture.<br />Don't attach to material possession because they don't satisfy us. Don't cling on to things; let the experience penetrate you instead.<br />We also need to forgive ourselves. For all the things we didn't do. All the things we should have done. You can't get struck on the regrets of what should have happened.<br /><br />Listed below is beautiful quote extracted from the book:<br />\\"Dying is only one thing to be sad over. Living unhappily is something else.\\" (p35)<br />\\"The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. We're teaching the wrong things. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it. Create your own.\\" (p35)<br />\\"Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn't. You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted.\\" (p40)<br />\\"A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle.\\" (p40)<br />\\"Love wins, Love always wins.\\" (p40)<br />\\"The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives purpose and meaning.\\" (p43)<br />\\"The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in.\\" (p52)<br />\\"I give myself a good cry if I need it. But then I concentrate on all the good things still in my life.\\" (p57)<br />\\"If you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too - even when you're in the dark. Even when you're falling.\\" (p61)<br />\\"What if today were my last day on earth?\\" \\"The culture doesn't encourage you to think about such things until you're about to die.\\" \\"We are involved in trillions of little act just to keep going. So we don't get into the habit of standing back and looking at our lives and saying, Is this all?\\" (p64,p65)<br />\\"To know you're going to die and to be prepared for it at any time.\\" (p81)<br />\\"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\\" (p82)<br />\\"If you accept that you can die at any time - then you might not be as ambitious as you are.\\" (p83)<br />\\"We are too involved in materialistic things, and they don't satisfy us.\\" (p84)<br />\\"There is no foundation, no secure ground, upon which people may stand today if it isn't the family.\\" (p91)<br />\\"Learn to detach.\\" \\"Don't cling to things, because everything is impermanent.\\" \\"But detachment doesn't mean you don't let experience penetrate you. On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully. That's how you are able to leave it.\\" (p103)<br />On crying. \\"Turnon the faucet. Wash yourself with the emotion.\\" (p105)<br />On fear of aging. \\"Forget what the culture says. I have ignored the culture much of my life. I am not going to be ashamed. What's the big deal?\\" (p116)<br />\\"All this emphasis on youth - I don't buy it.\\" (p117)<br />\\"The young are not wise. They have very little understanding about life.\\" \\"As you grow, you learn more.\\" \\"Because if you've found meaning in your life, you don't want to go back. You want to go forward.\\" (p118)<br />\\"Do the kinds of things that come from the heart. When you do, you won't be dissatisfied, you won't be envious, and you won't be longing for somebody else's things.\\" (p128)<br />\\"Part of the problem is that everyone is in such a hurry.

You find out who you are, who the other person is and how you accommodate or don't.\\" \\"There are a few rules I know to be true about love and marriage: if you don't respect the other person, you're going to have a lot of trouble.

1932100660|5.0|This book offers incredibly strong evidence that excessive animal protein in the diet has devastating consequences for people's health. I was a lacto vegetarian but this book made me into a vegan. Even my wife and my best friend, both total cheese junkies, have become vegans after reading this book. This book makes clear that the billions of dollars that have been spent and will be spent on cancer cures will be less effective in alleviating that disease than a few million that would put this book in the hands of every concerned doctor and parent in the country.    Becoming a vegan is not a chore. For me its been a joy. I love not eating animal proteins anymore. My energy is better than it has been for years. I'm almost 58 years old.  A couple weeks ago I dug a pond behind our suburban house, brought in big rocks and made a nice waterfall. Did all the shoveling, moving etc. No problem. Ten years ago when I was eating meat I think it would have killed me to do that work. Veganism really does give me more energy. Plus I finally dropped the 12 pounds I couldn't lose around my stomach. Amazingly, I can eat as much as I want and I still maintain my proper weight. I don't know if everyone will find this to be true, but my experience mirrors what the book propounds.
B000E6ET1G|5.0|This CD has some great songs on it, many of them obscure. Some of the garage bands' original songs sound like covers of tunes by the Beatles, Bob Dylan, etc. Some sound musically as good, if not better than the copied artists. I also found several musicians in these groups that went on to later play with groups who found much greater success in the music business.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I absolutely loved this version of Little Dorrit.  I found the acting to be excellent, the sets well done and I had no issue at all with understanding the accents.  I watched all five parts on Masterpiece and plan on buying the DVD when it becomes available.  Well done!
B001TCAT9U|5.0|This little review focuses on the surround sound.    Depeche Mode have been re-releasing all of their old albums in 5.1 surround sound, and are now releasing this new album in a surround sound version as well. I've purchased all of the old surround sound albums, and while the quality occasionally disappoints, overall, these new mixes have been great. This new album is no exception; both the atmospheric and more up-tempo stuff greatly benefits from the use of the rear surrounds.     Musically, it's one of their best efforts in years - it sounds a lot better than \\"Exciter\\" and \\"Playing the angel\\". If you have a surround sound system and enjoy Depeche Mode, this is a no-brainer.
0316010669|4.0|In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explains many things about what humans do when they have to make a decision. Is it a long and drawn out process? Or is it, simply, a \\"snap\\" decision? It is, Gladwell argues, the second choice. Whether the consequences of this action are good or bad doesn't influence our way of making it. Through style, tone, and impact, Gladwell presents us with a thoroughly entertaining nonfiction study of human behavior.   There are, arguably, three fundamental ways to present a topic through a book. Style is incredibly important: it can express an unimpressively boring subject with a gleeful zeal that can make it interesting. The author of Blink has a bare idea but uses different types of structures to express it. Within the bulk of the eight main sections, there are mini-sections. That is, to elaborate further on examples, which brings the second part of the structure: examples. Gladwell has all of the hypotheses he can muster, but he also backs him up with legit historical and factual events that back up his point. The second part of writing is tone, which can very from cynical to joyful. The writer seems to find a nice balance between sarcasm and exuberance. Passion is another word that comes to mind, as the subject seems to be of great interest to the writer. The impact of a book is the climax and the conclusion. With Blink, he makes it fulfilling. It has an all-around view from every side in every situation, and the analysis seems well researched and well informed.    The theory of thin slicing is the dominant theory available in the book. It proves in just a few words that everyone makes split decisions on a consistent basis. Gladwell expresses this well, through style, tone, and impact. Why did Warren Harding become president? Why do most couples use \\"Irreconcilable Differences\\" as a reason for divorce? Why do most people never notice the little mistakes in the marble of a statue? All of the answers to these questions lie in the magical world ofBlink.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|This is really less of a Bond movie and more of a Jason Statham style action movie.  The camera angles and action sequences are reminiscent of \\"Crank\\" and \\"Ronin\\".  I kept waiting for that classic Bond wit and nifty little gadgets, but they just never arrived.  There really isn't even any acting in this movie accept for the stunt doubles.  No memorable lines, scenes, etc.  It is just one fast-paced roller-coaster ride.  I happen to like that, so I wasn't disappointed in this non-Bond action thriller.<br /><br />Will it keep your attention, yes.  But is it really a Bond film, hardly.
0452286751|5.0|I read the Fountainhead in the Summer of 1961, when I was 22.  I thought it was the best book I had ever read - until I read Atlas Shrugged.  Even then, with no experience, I understood what Ayn Rand was writing about.  Now, as I approach 70, I remember those reads as if I had them memorized, and here is my book report on the first.<br /> The Fountainhead is about the war waged by one, Ellsworth Toohey against the soul of the individual.  Why he waged such a war, I have never been able to determine.  No more have I been able to fathom the choice of crime over hard work.  No more the choice of religious terrorism over religious tolerance.  No more the atheism which is nothing without God.  Better to be counted a Taliban who would NEVER bomb a statue or diminish a woman.<br /> Ellsworth is one of the great enigmas of literature.  He would rather no progress than to have to produce anything that has calculable value to another.  He would be the one who decides what the value is and who will posess the title.  Ellsworth is a cheat, a liar, a prevaricator, a manipulator and, because he is all of that, and intelligent, he is Ayn Rand's example of the Great Progressive.  His only decent characteristic is that he is not a politician.  He is a carp by choice and by literary design.<br /> The Fountainhead is fiction, but be certain of one thing.  Ellsworth is alive and still working as hard as ever.  Sadly, most folks haven't got a clue about that.  They don't see him everywhere the way I do.  Well, here's the way you can see him as clearly as I.  When you meet someone who justifies mediocrity in anything, look carefully, and you will see Ellsworth as himself or in drag.  Once you get his message, you will understand and 'objectivise' his universal presence.  Ayn Rand wrote about the ease with which the mass of non-geniuses, to which most of us belong, can be led to believe that those with ability are to be channeled into endeavors of value to us.  We are led to be social workers rather than engineers by insuring that the least trouble with math during elementary school is an excuse to shunt someone to non-quantitative employment.  The bright are separated, because we don't want them to be bored, but they are bored anyway.  They do not even have the challenge to help their less able classmates, because they have been isolated in another track.  Children are labeled by their academic performance in K-4.  Parents lobby for quick advancement for THEIR offspring who are, naturally, the best and the brightest is neither in or for their best interests and futures.  Everyone has to have the opportunity to be the best that s/he can be, so everyone goes unprepared.  Ellsworth and mediocrity.  Those who can analyze Ayn Rand by the power of her character constructs do NOT dare go near her philosophy.  Her philosophy is the philosophy of clear, and brutal, honesty.  She would rather that the education that has devolved so surely to the medi-ochre, be redesigned, instead, to teach all knowledge to students who may need to measure, divide or imagine, as well as they can learn, by the hands and minds of those who understand the fundamentals of what it is they now only pretend to teach.  Of least concern in one's education should be what the teacher thinks.  Rather, the measure of a good education is the degree to which a student learns to think with objectivity/clarity and individuality.  Ayn Rand is bemoaning the progressive creation of the eternal, unthinking, mob.  As fiction, it may have the weakness of too much crystallized truth.  As fiction, the strength of The Fountainhead is that Ayn Rand captures us all in her stark characters.  She has an agenda, and she presents it in a timeless manner.  Why else are folks still calling her names and characterizing her nature rather than discussing her thesis?  Her FICTION is not set in any past, nor any future.  Her story is set in the now.  It is always relevant in the NOW.  No less so than when I was 22.  If you want to discuss a theory of mine, try the following.  There are more communists/socialists in Burbank, CA than in the whole of the Czeck Republic (past CR president) - US versions of the Taliban, too.  Don't deny it unless you have evidence to the contrary, such as, are there more male or female mud wrestlers in the USA?  And, how many of the Abu Graib miscreants were members of a religious group?  My estimate is that most of them would ascribe to the doctrine of the Progressive; yet, in the way of the progressive, it was the political (religious) right that received the enmity of the mob.  Even now, the progressive excuse for failure is \\"GW\\".  Ellsworth is everywhere, and Ayn Rand was correct.  We have a weakened system of governance, a weakened system of education and a weakened economic system.  Current governance depends on the manipulation of the mob.  Education creates the mob, and the bankers, the rich, and the religious are to blame for everything.  The much more intelligent progressives will come to our rescue again.  Oops!  I suspect Ayn would strongly suggest that I either end or get back on point.  So, my advice is buy it NOW, read it, and screw your head on properly as soon as possible! Best wishes to all, and \\"Hic Finis Est\\"!ant to discuss a theory of mine, try the following.

B000HWZ4A2|3.0|I recently read \\"The Fountainhead\\" and was curious as to how it would be made into a movie.  I am also a Gary Cooper fan and wondered how he would play the main character.    The movie comes across as a series of monologues rather than good dialogue.  The characters appear to be talking at each other rather than with each other.  The actors do their best with the material, but unless you've read the book it would be difficult to follow what's happening on the film.    Not recommended for anyone who has not read the book. I found the movie to be a nice diversion, but before you spend money on the movie spend money on the book.    Ayn Rand's forte is philosophy, not screenwriting.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|This film is a docu-drama about the 1917 Russian Revolution that transferred political power from the Tsars (royal Romanov family) to a socialist / communist gov't under Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Also chronicled the start of the Socialist labor and Communist parties in America.    Much of the film is about the American Socialist labor movement of the early teens in NYC as a rebellion against the Industrial Revolution during the late 19th century. The other third of the film shows John Reed in the Russia during the early Communist party formation, trying to get legitimacy from the RU party for the Amer party. While there he wears himself down physically. Then his left-behind wife, Bryant, crosses Finland to St Petersburg too, but too late where Reed dies of typhus (\\"Jail Fever,\\" a sanitation disease caused by bacteria which attack the brain, spread by body lice, which was common in Russia. (only curable with the antibiotics tetracycline, occurs naturally in beer fermentation (Conover, Pfizer 1950 patent) and prevented with insecticide DDT (Muller, 48 Nobel) discovered in 1939).    As an adjunct film of history on the Industrial Revolution, watch the first half of PBS's TV epic by Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel (05).\\" It shows how the agricultural and industrial revolutions profoundly affected world politics, including conquest, colonialism, and socialistic communities. Driving former agrarian peoples (serf sharecropper, slavery, feudalism) from the farm to cities and its centers for education was essential to create the artisan worker (middle-class). This also created the economically powerful capitalist-class. The socialistic counter-attack was German Karl Marx and Frederich Engels thesis \\"Das Kapital (1867)\\" which addressed the exploitation and alienation of the laboring class.     The industrial revolution started in the UK in the late 18th and 19th centuries starting with textile and steel making, canals and rail, and steam power. The Russian political revolution started in Petrograd (St Petersburg) then the largest city and capital of Russia at the time at the eastern-most edge of the Baltic Sea, next to Finland and closest port to W Europe's technology.    It became the industrial center of Russia, with canals cut in the former swamp and in 1718 to the headwaters of Volga River system which is 80 miles from Moscow, iron ore deposits south of Moscow near the Ukraine boarder, coal near Moscow, steam engine technology starting in 1837, Russian Academy of Sciences, Petrograd State U, Technology and Mining Institutes, Medical-Surgical and Naval Academies and migration of the serfs emancipated by Alexander II starting in 1861. The 1916 Petrograd population was 2.4 million housed in large community housing building projects.    Much of Beatty's Russia was filmed in Finland with expensive recreation of Russian sets, as he botched getting permission from the former USSR gov't in the late 70s, as they were in the midst of Soviet War in Afghanistan (79-89) with the US, UK, and PRChina supporting the Muslim Mujahideen rebels in a guerrilla war. This was a half-decade before Perestroika economic restructuring was starting in 1986 by Gorbachev, as centralized-management model of Soviet industry and agriculture was failing due, in part, with the debilitating Afghan war.    He initially went to visit Moscow's centralized film industry, MOSFilm, but started off on the wrong foot, calling the 1917 Oktoberist Revolution a mere \\"Bolshevik takeover.\\" Did this backlash cause the film not adequately described in the \\"Reds\\" was the revolutionary proletariat (labor class), Vladimir Lenin, and the formation of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP)? The RSDLP later formed the Russian Communist Party. Vladimir Lenin (as Roger Sloman) appearance in \\"Reds\\" was a mere look-alike in the background, even though he was elected Chmn of the Soviet Congress at 47 years old on 8 Nov 1917.    Instead Beatty's dialog emphasized Reed's conflict with Grigory Zinoviev (as Jerzy Kosinski) who was one of Lenin's closest aides. Before the Oktoberist 1917 revolution, he wrote a position paper against an armed revolution against the weakened, inbred Tsarist monarchy. This caused Zinoviev's temporary expulsion from the Soviet Central Committee and eventual imprisonment for treason.    Beatty's film did not have an epilogue where Stalin's rise to power after Lenin's (1870-1924) (Kazan U, LLB U StPetersburg, taught Geneva U) assassination attempt (1918), refusing hospitalization and resulting a long debilitating 6-year illness. Stalin emphasized industrial and agricultural development away from the vulnerable Baltic after WW I towards the interior Moscow, Volga River and Ural Mts dividing Europe and Soviet Asia.    Good thing that Beatty had essentially a blank check from Paramount / Gulf+Western coffers as filming took about a year and burned up over a million feet of film, that was specially processed in Rome, Italy, in order to get the special dark filming effects, pioneered by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who won 3 Oscars, including \\"Apocalypse Now (79)\\" (Coppola, dir, 2 Oscars) and \\"The Last Emperor (87)\\" (Bertolucci, dir, 9 Oscars).      ENR is a proprietary Technicolor process (originally developed for Vittorio Storaro by Technicolor-Rome by three employees with initials E, N & R). It is one of the many bleach retention processes: after the bleach bath in the pos process, the film is passed through a black and white developer which reconverts the bleached silver ions to silver, which is not removed in the fixer. The result is a very contrasty and desaturated image, with particularly rich blacks but subdued colors.    Overall, a great docudrama movie, well researched and well filmed. But too long, 3 1/4 hrs. In the movie marketplace it did poorly only grossing at the box office of $40M, with a production budget $32M. Paramount lost money on American Communist party history.
B0019T9FL6|2.0|Being a huge Jennifer Hudson fan, I was so looking forward to her first CD. Her beautiful voice that was so wonderful on American Idol and other TV guest spots that she was on... well, like so many other of the American Idol finalists who have made CD's and not remained true to their voices, Jennifer Hudson is following in the same footsteps. This certainly was not the voice we heard during the competition. This was just a mix of generic sounding songs, and most of them screamed instead of sung. Jennifer Hudson doesn't need to scream a song, but obviously someone thought she needed to.    Whoever was in charge of choosing the music for her for this CD, really came up short. None of the songs shows off her extremely soulful voice. None of the songs even comes close to showing what her voice can do.  What a sad dissappointment this CD is. I hope she has more control over what the music on her next CD is going to be.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This BBC / PBS -like political biographical documentary film shows how US Presidential cabinets are formed and the impact of decisions on foreign affairs at the highest level. Director Errol Morris portrays 85-yr old Robert McNamara, then Secretary of Defense for 7 years during partial JFK and LBJ terms (61-68, fired just after the Tet Offensive). Dialog and supporting screenplay maintains a sensitive, dramatic, and interesting talking head portrait for 1 1/2 hrs on DVD. The brilliantly crafted retrospective McNamara's involvement in the WWII (41-45), Korean and Cold (47-91) and Vietnam War (59-75) 35-yrs ago against the communist arch-nemeses PRChina and USSR within the context of the SE Asian Domino theory.     The Errol Morris film won the 2004 Oscar for best documentary. Box office gross was $5M. Having also read the book with same title by Blight and Lang, this Reviewer strongly recommends the DVD over the book, as the book contains less than half of McNamara's theses.    To date, over 14 Sec'ty of Defense have shaped world conflicts within 9 administrations; JBJ, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, GHW Bush, Clinton, GW Bush and Obama; covering troops in Somalia (92-95), Yugoslavia (93-96), Afganistan (01-pres), and Iraq (03-pres), among scores of other conflict involving less than a thousand troops or 25 aircraft. The CIA has covert actions that are on-going in the PLO, Iran and Venezuela. (Ref: Wiki List_of_United_States_military_history_events and also CIA_sponsored_regime_change)    Clearly the hot seat has been on successive SECDEFs Melvin Laird and Jim Schlesinger during the defeat of the Vietnam War; Dick Cheney and Bill Perry during Somalia and Yugoslavia; and Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates during Afghanistan and Iraq.      As the US / Obama is currently trying to recover from a major global recession, viewing this retrospective would give insights on the dilemma that faces the current cabinet and policy towards Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. After witnessing Obama's first 100 days, his tour in E Euro and Latin America and Sec'ty of State Clinton in Mexico, the Middle and Far East shows that this is a major policy shift from the 8-yr former G.W. Bush administration, including SECDEF Donald Rumsfeld and SECSTATE Condoleezza Rice.    So far SECDEF Robert Gates is going along with the draw down of Iraq with a simultaneous increase in Afghanistan. Advanced technology with use of remotely controlled drone surveillance and combat aircraft will reduce the number of troops in harms way.        -----    What was especially poignant in the film is the admission that Army Air Corp General LeMay and SECDEF McNamara could have been charged as War Criminals if the US had lost the war. Both sanctioned fire-bombing of more than 60 of Japan's entire cities taking military targets and factories, as well as civilian commercial and residential districts in-toto, totaling over a quarter million civilians deaths. The two atomic bomb deaths include an additional quarter million civilians.    ------    Below are McNamara's on truths and lessons.

1577314808|5.0|If you are reading this, there is little doubt that you have either read or at least heard of Eckhart Tolle's works by now.  Oprah made Eckhart even more popular and accessible last year with her eight week online seminar for his most recent work, \\"A New Earth:  Awakening To Your Life's Purpose\\".  That book is an amazing accomplishment, but for me, it all goes back to \\"The Power of Now\\".  Simple yet profound, the message conveyed in this book is one that has had a deep impact on my life.  I have read it twice, and will read it and refer to it for years to come.      The beauty of this book is that it is not a self-help fad, not a quick-fix, not a silly flavor-of-the-week approach to looking at your life and the world around you differently.  Eckhart's power as a writer and spiritual teacher is his ability to take the teachings of many traditions (including Buddhism and Catholicism) and condense them into something that any person can relate to, regardless of religious or spiritual affiliation.  The essence and teachings in \\"The Power of Now\\" can be applied to any religious tradition or background.  Even if you are an atheist, or are questioning life, the crazy world we live in, and God, you will be able to relate and find meaning in this work.    All of Eckhart's other works build upon this one.  This is a must-read and a must-own.  There is nothing weird, crazy, or \\"out-there\\" about this book.  That's what makes it so special.  If you are open to learning, and to looking at truly finding peace in your own life, this book can be life-changing.

B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac is one of my favorite albums of all time.  From :01 seconds to the end, the album is a total mystic trip.  I love how acoustic and dreadfull it all sounds because I want music to affect me.  Amnesiac is a real work of art and Thom is a genius songwriter.  This album along with In Rainbows, were my first albums from Radiohead.  I've listened to others over time and this one remains my favorite to this day.<br /><br />It's slower than the other albums, but if sad songs sound better, than this one is in your favor.  Favorites are Pyramid Song, You and Whose Army, Knives Out, Morning Bell, Dollars and Cents, and especially Life in a Glass House.<br /><br />If you like Radiohead in the least bit, pick up this album.  It's one of those albums that suprises you with how different it sounds and how catchy it ends up being.  I can listen to this thing over an over again, and it still does not grow old.  This is when you know you have really found valuable music.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|The movie picks up right where the other one left off. It conveys a picture perfect portrayal of the James Bond that we all know and love. I truely enjoyed watching this movie and can't wait for another one.
B001ED7C58|4.0|There are a few songs i really love on here, a few are okay, some not so great. overall i am very happy i purchased it. The Rob P and Iron and Wine tracks make the purchase worthwhile regardless of rest of album.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|To the un-initiated, this might not be the best gateway to Leonard Cohen.<br /><br />But to the existing Cohen fan, oh my, are you in for a treat.  I saw the LA leg of this tour & it was one of the best nights of my life.  I'd still recommend you still see him life if you can, but if you can't (or after you have), a great, great DVD to own & have.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I agree with Mr. Big's review. I watched the original 2006 blu-ray release, and I found the picture to be far too light and pretty noisy. After reading the reviews on amazon of the 2006 disc, I decided to wait for a re-release, which I hoped would offer better picture quality. In my opnion, the \\"skynet edition\\" does exactly that. The blacks are deeper, and the colors are as a result richer. There is some loss of fine detail, but it's still a noticeable improvement over the DVD releases and, IMHO, a welcome addition to the rather large family of T2 discs.     On to the movie itself --- the disc contains the theatrical version, which I personally prefer. Left out is a dream sequence scene, in which Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn, hero of the first film) visits Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) to admonish Sarah to do whatever she can to protect son John (Edward Furlong), who will become the leader of the human resistance after judgment day. While it was certainly nice to see future soldier Reese again on the director's cut DVD (I think Biehn is the most underrated part of the first film), this scene felt tacked on, which is probably why Cameron didn't include it in the theatrical release. Also thankfully left out is a hokey scene in which John teaches the T-800 terminator (Arnie) how to smile.    Bottom line, this is a better quality blu-ray than the 2006 edition, and since amazon is offering it for $14.99, a relative bargain if you want to have the thus-far best T2 disc.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Quiet Nights  Not as good as her previous work, but it makes for a good night of listening.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|I somehow managed to keep all knowledge and reviews of this film from me until I watched it last night.<br /><br />I will give a brief description of the plot, but I will not give away too much:<br />Michael, a cold and emotionally hardened man, recalls the past that made him that way.  As a young student in post-WW2 West Germany, he slips into an intimate and risky relationship with an older woman, Hanna.  Together they consummate an unusual love and he reads aloud to her.  Suddenly, she is gone and his heart is forever broken.  Years later, as a university law student, he finds her again ... only to have their love, her past, and his future further complicated.  The rest you will have to watch for yourself.<br /><br />The parallels of guilt, culpability, and what we do to others, on a large scale during war and in the most intimate and brief of love affairs, really make this film.  It is this intriguing look at our selfish, stupid pride; our naivet&eacute;; and our inability to answer for our pasts.<br /><br />The ideas of this film are refreshing.  It is a complex look at human nature and human relationships.  Kate Winslet plays the role of Hanna beautifully--you never really know her, you can barely feel for her, and yet you can comprehend how she chooses her life.  David Cross is also superb as young Michael: you can see his transformation from boy to man, from naive to jilted through his subtle portrayal.<br /><br />The Reader is a quiet reflective film (although it is quite abundant in nude scenes) that should be watched for its complexity of theme and characters.  Highly recommended.
B000066C6F|4.0|How could this movie go wrong, it stars two of my favorite actors.  I thought a couple of the scenes were a little over the top.  One of the story lines that impressed me was the integrity of John's character in keeping his sources confidential but also being such a sleeze when it came to getting a story.  The other story line was the obsession that people have about their bodies as if their appearance was all that mattered and their heads could be full of fluff.  I would recommend this movie to anyone for just pure entertainment also.  If I wanted totally intellectual movies or programs then I would go and immerse myself in deep thoughts like the scarecrow.  If you want a movie that's easy on the eyes and brain that still carries an inner message then this is the one for you.

B00003CWPL|5.0|I love all of Lynch's films, but Eraserhead changed the way I view cinema. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. A great dvd for all of us used to awful bootlegs.
B000025Z2D|5.0|Being a Mark Knopfler fan is the great. It really doesn't matter if it's music from the 80's, Dire Straits, or his solo work to date. It's all that good. Actually it's awesome and near perfection. This group of players is a well rounded cast with each enjoying the spotlight. The first reviews I read on Amazon were exactly true. A sunday morning, play all the way through cd. It is one that I will try to wear out, and then buy a new copy.

B001QERPDO|2.0|I am almost 60, but I like to listen to some of the newer artists (if I can understand what they say!) and I had heard this group sing \\"The Man Who Can't be Moved\\" which I like alot.  Lead singer has wonderful voice, and the lyrics told a story that all can identify with - no matter their age.  BUT, I am SAD that such a talented group has to throw in the old \\"F\\" word here and there or allude to it as part of the lyrics (If you see kay)  Brittney wasn't THAT original (If you seek Amy).  So many wonderful words in the English language.  I do wish the Fword would be replaced by another - so tired of hearing it.  Everyone! Get some originality! So, when I caught the inuendo, I stopped the cd and have it listed for sale!  At least, mine will be cheaper for someone else to tsk-tsk over!

B000SFP68I|5.0|Fantastic! What else can  I say about this album. When I was a teenager the Stones were not what I listened to, but now in my 50's I appreciate the Stones even more.This album from:Gimme Shelter to You Can't Always Get What You Want, the songs just revolve in your head,and you can't get them out of your head! They just can't make classic music like that anymore. The new band's can't make music like that at all, they can't even carry a guitar solo(except for maybe a half dozen or so). Cal S

B000003TA4|5.0|I've read some of the one-star reviews of this album.  Don't believe a one-star of it.  Of course, if you just don't like harder nihilistic rock, you won't like this either.  But this isn't toneless punk that's just screaming or heavy metal ranting either:  No way that kind of band could ever record Something In The Way.  Nirvana:  I'm reminded of early Ramones transformed into melodic punk rockers.  This seminal album combines a driven, hard-edge point of view with disaffected associations towards everything.  The title says it all -- Nevermind -- an afterthought of afterthoughts.  Whether you think the band sold out early and sought out commercial success, etc., doesn't change the contents of this disk.  Just because Nirvana launched a 1000 pretender bands doesn't matter either.  5-stars, period, on contents alone.
B00001SIES|5.0|Like some of you, I got into Muse after I read the Twilight books by Stephenie Meyer.  She constantly mentioned this group in all her acknowledgements at the end of every book, so I thought I'd check them out since they gave her such inspiration to write such incredible books.  I ended up picking up Black Holes & Revelations; one of the best CD's I ever bought.  I had to get the rest of the Muse collection so I bought them all.  Showbiz is my favorite of all the Muse CD's.  Most people's favorite is Absolution, which is a great album, but I love the raw rock sound of Showbiz.  With the beginning song on the album, Sunburn, I was hooked on this CD.  Muse is a spectacular band and Matthew Bellamy is a incredible song writer.  Can't wait for their new CD to come out this year and can't wait for them to come to town on tour!  If you love Muse and you love good rock songs get this CD, you'll love it!
0061139378|5.0|Our daughter loves scary stories.  She also likes Tim Burton directed movies as well, so I bought this book on the advice of a friend who was looking for it for her son. My friend told me it was a quick read but I hadn't expected my daughter to start and finish it in an afternoon. She thought the illustrations were \\"freaky\\" and showed me one that was particularly scary to her. She's looking forward to viewing the Tim Burton film which is based on this book.
B001LMU182|3.0|I thought this would be a great step up from my DVD special edition (tin box). The only thing better was the picture. The sound was terrible. The Dolby 5.1 Japanese was too soft in places and too loud in other places. Sometimes I couldn't hear the voices very well. Yes, I made sure it was the correct Dolby 5.1 track and not Dolby TrueHD. The Dolby 5.1 English track was totally new with new actors... What's wrong with the old English actors? NOTHING! Why on earth did they change the English track? I'm so used to the English voices this annoyed me! I traditionally watch Japanese animes in Japanese, but Akira is the only anime I enjoy in English.    Stay away from this Blu-ray unless you really want the better picture -- maybe play the special DVD on another player and sync the audio.    Note: I don't have an HDMI sound system (Logitech Z-5500), however, every other Blu-ray movie plays fine and I expected this to play fine, too.
B0000028WD|5.0|This product is great in that it brings Dylan songs by other artists. A must for the Dylan lover.
B001PA65VC|5.0|I can't believe the other reviews on this CD. \\"Sounds too much like their old albums.\\" Uh... that's because they are the Prodigy. I expect their songs to sound similar. Each music artist has \\"their sound\\" and you should expect to hear \\"that sound\\" from each album.    This CD is fantastic. The opening track is great and booming. The drums in the \\"Run with the Wolves\\" track are killer. The DVD is nice - two music videos and the rest are live performance tracks.    If you even remotely like The Prodigy then this is a must buy.    I would buy from Amazon.com's MP3 store, but I like FLAC encoded audio these days and a CD-ROM is the only way you can get that unfortunately. Listen up Amazon: put up FLAC and I'll buy your digital tracks instead.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|While the movie version with Sir Derek Jacobi was certainly wonderful, I believe the current Masterpiece Classic edition is superior, for a lot of reasons.  First & foremost, Matthew Macfadyen is more convincing as a man Amy Dorrit could fall in love with.  He was believeable as a man 'twice her age' yet still it was easy to see why he would've caught Amy's eye, initially.  And as much as I love Derek Jacobi, I didn't feel that way about him.  Secondly, the actors in this production are among the best British actors available today. Most have had careers in film and television as well as stage work, and I suppose are better known to viewers of those mediums.  Matthew Macfadyen, Alun Armstrong (the best Wackford Squeers ever-Nicholas Nickleby), Tom Courtenay and the wonderful James Fleet were happily familiar. Claire Foy as Little Dorrit was a treasure - very fragile and strong at the same time.  I especially liked her interactions with her Uncle Frederick (James Fleet).  The score was marvelous as well.  I could find no fault with this production whatsoever.
0545128285|1.0|Gosh. I hate to say anything bad because I loved Harry Potter so much... but it is with great regret that I must tell the truth and reveal that I was sorely craving some relief from the void the end of the Harry Potter saga left me and this did not deliver. It came across very much as an attempt on the part of J.K. Rowling and/or the publisher to just put something out that would sell based off of all our desires to have and 8th Harry Potter book. It reads as a collection of very mediocre children's tales with commentary from Dumbledore after each one. Short and uninspiring--very much unlike the Harry Potter saga. Sorry J.K., sorry to all who loved Harry Potter, it's just not good in my opinion. At least it wasn't expensive and thank God I didn't buy the cool-looking collector's edition--I almost did. Buy the collector's Edition if you want more money to go to the Charity and want a cool piece for your bookshelf.
B0000844I8|1.0|I had the Special Edition of this movie for quite sometime until the Ultimate Edition came about some years ago. I exchanged it and was able to compare the two pictures. The picture quality of the ULTIMATE was way too much better. Unfurtunately the ULTIMATE EDITION has a burnt piece of frame in a place the Special Edition hasn't. When James Spader is watching the dunes when they arrive at the New Planet. This is totally unacceptable. It's the same as buying the 2nd Platinum Edition of SNOW WHITE and discover there are dirt and debris on some frames just to annoy us, the consumer.
0385733577|4.0|This is a very interesting story. There are some new ideas put forth that make this more than just common fantasy fare. This is not a Harry Potter copycat or remotely related to Harry Potter as the title may lead one to believe (due to the name \\"Nicholas Flamel\\", which consequently, is not a name unique to the Harry Potter story.)   I just finished book 1- The Alchemyst and it abruptly ends leaving you on the edge of a cliff, so book 2- The Magician is necessary to truly finish the story it would appear---glad i bought both together... looks like part three is out already as well. May want to buy all 3 while you're at it and get yourself some free shipping...
1932100660|2.0|Interesting read, but it left out the fact of ethnic evolutionary differences in physiology.    For example - Asians are generally highly lactose intolerant (something like 90%), whereas Europeans are not. Similar to American Indians having higher rates of diabetes and a lower tolerance for alcohol depending on foods eaten. Different groups have adapted to different diets. There is no one size fits all as far as diet is concerned.     I cannot eat rice, soy etc... due to my particular genetic traits - I come from a European background and have an endocrine system syndrome that basically requires me to eat like a diabetic. I need to balance lean protein (non soy protein) fats and carbs from vegetables.    And what about cases such as that of the Amish in the US? They eat full fat dairy and meat and are very fit and have good health in general and good longevity. I think the quality of the food (non processed) and physical activity combined with stress reduction would boost longevity more than veganism. Vegans don't live longer and really are not much healthier.    Without data from other ethnic groups, this is pointless. A whole food diet is important, but his thesis is too broad. Just studying one ethnic population doesn't prove it will work on other groups exactly the same way.

B00000JQFM|5.0|When Satriani released this album, it turned guitar upside down, instrumental albums being marketable and profitable were just unheard of at the time.  There are many guitarists, then and now, that have an incredible ability to play fast licks with all the associated tricks and squeals and awe-inspiring waves of dorian wonder, but what sets Satriani apart and always has, is his knowledge of music.  He is well versed in musical theory and knows his instrument.  His talent lies in his phrasing, he has an uncanny ability to write melodies that seem so completely natural, you wonder why you've never heard it before.  It's one of those, slap-the-forehead moments!  If you enjoy guitar, but have never really gotten into instrumental rock give this album, Flying in a Blue Dream and the Extremist a try.  I think you will find that they have true song structure and you won't feel as if you are missing anything without the presence of a vocalist.
B000SNUMC0|4.0|Fantastic Album of Metal.  Forgive me, I don't get into lables so much (ie) Progressive, Thrash ect. Good Metal stands on it's own.    I'd never heard of Iced Earth before, I'm a 36yr old fan of heavy Metal of all kinds. I'll admit I have since found that I caught Iced Earth in transition so to speak with a different singer. but I think this album rocks!      Being a long time fan of Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Scorpions, Megadeth and the like, I was looking for something new, but I don't care for the nu-metal sound at all.  This album fit that mold nicely.     The strongest tracks to me are:  'Setian Massacre'  'A Charge to Keep' 'Ten Thousand Strong'  'Order Of The Rose' and 'The Clouding'      I really enjoyed putting the headphones on and listening to this album, it is very crunchy and the vocals are soaring.  Tim Owens sounds MUCH better here than on his Judas Priest albums IMO.   The story line, I can take or leave, as it requires you to \\"get into this fantasy world\\" Of Setians vs Humans, which at this stage in my life is a little \\"corny\\" But overall I like the music and lyrics enough to recommend it to my friends. I even checked out Glorious Burden (same vocalist) and purchased that as well.      I've learned my lesson over the years about following a band and purchasing every release (ie)  Metallica, Kiss and Judas Priest.  Most bands reach a creative peak and put out two or three great albums, and then spend the rest of their career trying to recapture the magic, or go in an entirely new direction to build a new fan base. The exceptions being Iron Maiden's (Matter of Life and Death)  and Judas Priest's (Nosradamus)        Iced Earth, as I've discorved them, seem to be in top form, and I for one highly recommend this release as well as Glorious Burden.     My advice for those of you who were disappointed with this:  Don't have a favorite band, you will always be disappointed, just have a favorite genre and cherry pick the best of the best, and before you knowit you will have a collection of music so awesome, that no matter which one you pick out to play you will have a smile on your face.
0670034711|3.0|It is hard to pick a genre for Eat, Pray, Love. It has been said that it is a self help book. It has been said it's a travel memoir. It has also been said that this book is a biography. I do not see it as either of these individually, but all three at the same time. It is a self help book in that she has a break down of major proportions at one point in her life and this is a story of how she returns from the dark side, so to speak. It is a travel memoir in that it documents her travels in three countries, although it is more like a diary of her thoughts, actions, and the people she meets. It's a biography, or more correctly - an autobiography, of this period of time in her life and all that she went through.   The book is well-written and, if I had to guess, written for females. I could see that a male may get something out of this book in theory, but it really is aimed at women. However, I wonder if this book was written as a record of her travels or a story written for her travels. Let me be clear, she tells us she was paid by her publisher before going on this trip. She went on this trip with money for a book she had not yet written about her travels. At times I caught myself wondering if she really did all of these things and if all of this really happened. There are a few things in the book that just seem to be too good to be true. I will not give any of these away, but it seems that her life just went so well during this time that it has to be at least partially made up. What if near the end of her trip she did not have a marvelous memoir of her travels and experiences in these three countries all starting with the letter I? Could she have not made up this story in order to support the money she was given? I am not saying that this story did not actually happen, the circumstances just make me wonder, that is all.    Her book starts in Italy, where she is spending her time pursuing pleasure. She is eating all manner of delicious foods while working on becominga happier person. At the beginning of this section she flashes back to tell of her break down and all that led up to it. After a nasty divorce and a torrid love affair she was at the end of her rope. So, she travels to Italy to find pleasure and learn Italian. She meets wonderful people who help to make her more of a happy person, as she does in each section.   She then travels to India in her search of God. Her search began initially while in the States, but continues here. She spends four months in an Ashram meditating and searching for divinity. This part tells of the people she meets and experiences she has while in India, just as she did in her Italy section. She puts a different spin on religion. In fact, she never really refers to what she is doing as religion. She is in the search of God, not religion. Her search for God takes her down an unbeaten path, but it works for her.   Her final destination of her year long quest is Indonesia. Here, she searches for balance between the two - pleasure and God. Her intent was to find a medicine man she met years before and learn from him. At the beginning of her journey she decided to steer clear of men, but here in Indonesia while she is finding your balance she meets someone who may change her mind. In her hunt for balance she, again, meets some very important people in her journey. She learns that God and pleasure can be part of the same life.   I have to say that I did not enjoy this book, but I did not hate it either. I doubt I would have chosen to read this book for pleasure, but, honestly, none of what she is writing about applies to me. I do not understand how she feels and what she went though. I have never had a monumental break down, and if I did I surely could not afford to travel around the world in search of the things that she is searching for. However, I do think that people who have experienced a break down such as Gilbert's would find this book enlightening.   I am not saying that everyone who has acrisis in life should fly around the world in search of how to make their life better and more balanced. I am simply saying that the things that she does - look for pleasure, search for God, and finding a balance between the two would be a great place for one to start getting back on track. By taking time out for yourself, you can do all of these things. Maybe taking a year off to attempt it isn't feasible, but taking time out to figure out what makes you happy is a good start. Then finding God, Allah, or whoever can help you, as well. By doing this you find that some things are bigger than you and you. Last, by balancing these two you find balance within yourself, making you happier.   I am not saying this will work for everyone with 100% success. I am just saying that this book could, in theory, provide you with a guide to help yourself. Did I like the book? It was okay. Would I suggest it to others? I would suggest it to some, but not to others. I don't think everyone can relate to this book.
B000002HAJ|5.0|I've fallen in love with The Cure while listening to their recent live shows. Porl, Simon, Jason and Robert are amazing live. Love them forever. Going backward in time, I have made it my duty to listen to all their old recordings. WISH has to be my favorite album because it has so many of my favorite songs - From The Edge of the Deep Green Sea, the ultimate soul stirrer - Open, with its hip-rocking beat - Doing The Unstuck, the \\"happiest\\" jump up and dance song The Cure has ever done -To Wish Impossible Dreams, with the beautiful guitar work and End, covering you in gloom with \\"please stop loving me.\\"  1992 was a very good year. Cheers!
B001EO748M|5.0|Just as fabulous as the first season. Hope they do all the way through to end of Elizabeth II.
B001NHNG64|4.0|A decent follow up to a great first novel. The sexual tension was great, the sex scene was dreadfully forced. The twists were small and not nearly as well planned as the first novel. However, it was great entertainment and gave us a fair bit more insight into the enigmatic anti-hero.    Warning EDITOR FAIL:  You do not speak into a \\"Mike\\" if you did, he would be angry,especially depending on what portion of him you were speaking into.    It is a \\"Mic\\" short for microphone. Not a person's name.     I'm seriously hoping it's just the kindle edition that has this obnoxious mistake, and I hope it gets resolved quickly because it totally took me out of the novel every damn time I saw it, especialy when it was grouped together at the end.
B000068TPN|4.0|If you're looking for a good film about Vietnam, this should definitely be on your list. As with most Mel Gibson films, he wants to grab his audience by the heart (Hamelt, Braveheart, etc.). He does his homework, and with the help of Randal Wallace, always pulls if off. It's a true story, of course dramatized, about the first official combat mission in Vietnam by the 7th Air Cav. Gibson portrays Lt. Col. Hal Moore (who is now a retired Army General). There are quite a few emotional moments, but the battlefield action prevents it from becoming the cross-over date flick like Braveheart. However, the sountract is stunning and soul-stirring; and the music from the end credits \\"Mansions of the Lord\\" was sung at President Reagan's funeral; how much more of an honor can you get?<br />The only criticisms that I can give are trying to play a bit TOO much for the sympathy card, but after all, Gibson always gives you both barrels, so really can't be faulted. I would have rated it 5 stars except for the extra shmaltz; but without a doubt, I would place it in the top 10 of Vietnam war movies; and an excellent reminder of the men whose names are engraved on the Wall that you'd never connect with had you not viewed the film. I highly recommend it!
B000001DVD|5.0|This ia an oldie but a goodie and has the extended version of Let it roll
B00006CXSS|4.0|This is a set of DVD's that I'd been waiting to get my hands on ever since the orginal HBO airings of the mini-series; but once it came out, I didn't have the huevos to put out that kind of money. But it's mine now, so for those few who've never seen it, here's a brief synopsis. Produced by Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List), this is one for the history books...literally. It's the true story of Easy Company, an airborne division that air dropped behind enemy lines the night before D-Day. Their history is detailed from the night of the drop through their final action of taking Hitler's Bertchesgarten (the Eagle's Nest, his mountain retreat). What separates this from the multitude of WW II movies is that, before each episode, surviving members of Easy Company at time of filming told their personal stories. As time continues, anyone involved in any theatre of the campaign will be gone; and it's that personal history that needs...MUST be preserved.<br />Great soundtrack, very realistic; to the last detail. Very well researched and documented.<br />Drawbacks: Price (it ain't your bargain bin product yet, but you get a lot of for what you pay!). The battle scenes are graphic, but war isn't pretty; and I'm glad the producers opted for real rather than sterile. I'm not a fan of the \\"handicam\\" view, as it causes a vertigo feeling when you view it (at least to me; make your own conclusions). It's long, but best viewed in one sitting...hard to do, but worth your time.<br />If you don't get that lump-in-your-throat, misty-eyed feeling during this film, check your heart and make sure you still have one!<br />Make it a tradition to watch this on on Memorial Day, at the minimum. Honor those who have made it possible for you to be here in the first place, let alone to see it in relative freedom. God bless the men of Easy Company, the veterans of every war, and those still fighting today for their country and for the sake of others; and for the ideals of freedom and democracy.m and democracy.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I bought this cd because it has a lot of my favorite songs on it !
B00005JLKB|5.0|I got hooked on Smallville with this very season.  My sister went out on a limb and bought the entire first season.  We didn't know if we would like it, but we thought \\"What the heck?\\"<br />What an understatement!  This is an amazing series!  The characters are so diverse, from the humble farmboy, Clark, to the high energy Chole, best friend Pete, girl-next-door Lana, and the rich boy, Lex.<br /><br />\\"Pilot\\": Clark's ship lands in Smallville in 1989.  Present day, Clark gets in trouble with Whitney, Lana's boyfriend.  Former hazing victim, now equipped with electrical powers, comes back to torment and kill the football jocks.  This is a great start to the series.  I love the beginning, with Lionel and a young Lex in the heliocopter. 5/5<br /><br />\\"Metamorphosis\\": Kid gets infected with bugs and turns into one, torments Lana.  Man, this episode can scare the crap out of you.  Not my favorite episode, but still pretty interesting.  Clark \\"flies\\" in this one. 4/5<br /><br />\\"Hothead\\": Gym teacher with a hot temper can create fire.  Good special effects and definitely interesting (particularly with special guest John Glover)! 4/5<br /><br />\\"Xray\\": Tina develops an unhealthy attachment to friend Lana; Clark discovers his X-Ray vision.  I love the opening sequence where it appears Lex is robbing the bank.  5/5<br /><br />\\"Cool\\": Ladies' man jock falls into a lake and can't get warm.  Starts going after his old girlfriends and freezing them solid.  This one is pretty terrifying and showcases Chloe beautifully.  4.5/5<br /><br />\\"Hourglass\\": An older man is able to switch to his younger self and attempt to enact revenge on the Jurists who put him in jail.  I love how Cassandra sees Clark's future and then Lex's.  5/5<br /><br />\\"Craving\\": Guest star Amy Adams is a fat girl who wants to get thin.  She does, but then develops a \\"craving\\" for fat.  Chloe meets Lex in this episode and Pete gets himself a date.  4.5/5<br /><br />\\"Jitters\\":  Earl Jenkins holds LuthorCorp hostage, trying to find Level 3 and a cure for his jitters.  An AMAZING episode, probably one of my favorites of the season.  We get to see how Lionel \\"handles\\" the situation, Chloe's dad, and Lex's self-sacrificial attitude.  5/5<br /><br />\\"Rogue\\":  A dirty cop finds out Clark's secret and forces the farm boy to assist him in crime.  Not one of my favorites (no one real reason).  4/5<br /><br />\\"Shimmer\\":  Someone is tormenting Victoria at Lex's mansion.  It looks like it's Lex's teenaged admirer...  I love seeing Lex in this episode, particularly with his interactions with Victoria and his father.  5/5<br /><br />\\"Hug\\":  A travelling salesman with the ability to force people to change their minds comes to Smallville and build a toxic planet nearby.  Enjoyable episode, particularly the part where Lex becomes a machine-gun wielding psycho killer.  4.5/5<br /><br />\\"Leech\\":  Geeky kid (Shawn Ashmore) sneaks Clark's powers and becomes super famous...and super burdened.  I really wasn't fond of the kid, how arrogant he became, but did like how Lex manipulated Victoria and her father.  3/5<br /><br />\\"Kinetic\\":  Three thieves who can move through walls and blackmail Lex.  Kinda stupid (the meteor-rock tattoos were over the top), but I enjoyed seeing Lex scramble for his lost items and Whitney really turn around.  3.5/5<br /><br />\\"Zero\\":  The events at Club Zero come back to haunt Lex.  Nice episode, showing both the good and bad sides of Lex.  5/5<br /><br />\\"Nicodemus\\":  A flower with the ability to change a person's behavior infects Jonathan...and then Lana...and then Pete.  I liked seeing the new Jonathan and Lana and how it ties in with Dr. Hamilton, brought up in the \\"Jitters\\" episode.  5/5<br /><br />\\"Stray\\":  A young boy who can read people's minds is being used to commit crimes but flees to Jonathan and Martha's farm.  I love the interactions between Clark and Ryan, Ryan reveals Chloe's feelings for Clark, and Lionel tempting his son with a job in Metropolis.  4.5/5<br /><br />\\"Reaper\\":  A young man is able to turn people to ash.  I love how Lex deals with the man Lionel sent to \\"babysit\\" Lex!  4/5<br /><br />\\"Drone\\":  The race for class president gets out of hand when two of the candidates are attacked by bees.  I like how Clark tries to run for president and how Pete assists him. 4/5<br /><br />\\"Crush\\":  A former art student, now equipped with telekinesis, returns to school and begins to enact revenge for the hit and run that ruined his skills.  We get to see Chloe have a brief romance and Lana get jealous.  4.5/5<br /><br />\\"Obscura\\":  Lana develops a power to see through a kidnapper's eyes, which she must use to save Chloe.  The \\"who-did-it\\" is pretty lame and nothing is very interesting in my opinion.  3/5<br /><br />\\"Tempest\\":  Lionel closes the plant, Clark takes Chloe to the spring formal, and Lana takes Whitney to the bus station...when a tornado hits.  A nice way to end the season, with all people in an uncertain future.  4.5/5<br /><br />Many people criticize the first season as being very \\"Monster of the Week\\".  It is true for the most part, but still, it is an enjoyable season.  You are introduced to the strange world of Smallville, the wonderful characters, and the beginnings of the Superman legend.  I highly recommend.<br /><br />Brought to you by<br />*C.S. Light*\\"Drone\\":  The race for class president gets out of hand when two of the candidates are attacked by bees.

0060723513|4.0|In my opinion, the import of this book cannot be overstated.  I read it in the mid-90's and it effects me everyday.  The Westernized mind can use every possible wake up call.  This one resonates for me.  I've given countless copies to friends and family.
B00005JCAA|4.0|I bought this 2-disc \\"Ultimate Edition\\" of \\"Meet Joe Black\\" because Disc 2 contains the film upon which the Brad Pitt vehicle is based--1934's \\"Death Takes a Holiday,\\" which stars Fredric March and Evelyn Venable. The old flick isn't for everyone, but I love it. It's not available by itself on DVD, so this is the only way to own a copy. And \\"Meet Joe Black\\" is a decent film in its own right.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|This movie is ok as action movies go, but he is not Bond. We've been through alot of Bonds & I have my faves but this guy isn't a Bond at all. I had to keep reminding myself that I was watching a Bond flick.
B0007PALSE|5.0|I must say, I really enjoyed this movie.  I had originally purchased the 1-disc of the movie and loved it.     The only problem was that special features department was lacking.  I ordered the (Two-Disc All-Access Collector's Edition) and was extremely satisfied with my movie experience.      Being a movie buff, I always enjoy a good movie experience, not just from watching the film, but also being able to respect the work and effort that goes into it.  This release of the film allows you just that.       The All-Access edition allows you to dig deep into the making-of and Production of the film, with over 4 hrs of Bonus materials including a behind-the-scenes look at the amazing CGI shots by Weta!              I was very happy to add this one to my collection and if you are a fan of this film and want learn the secrets behind it, I would recommend this in a heart beat!
B00004U2G1|2.0|Are you kidding me? Stereo? No multi-channel? The average sound system and  listener are not going to be able to tell the difference between this and the standard CD issue. (I realize the average system and listener aren't likely to collect SACD's but thats only a statement of comparison.)  The purpose of the medium is to provide a multichannel listening experience. This is just a ripoff.
B00180R06I|2.0|This film was disappointing for me because I expected a scary,haunting film. Its a great primer for students going into filmaking and cinematography. Light and shadow,texture, depth of field, and symbolism to pad the storyline give this film educational credibility.
0316143472|5.0|It is always a joy to read David Sedaris's essays, because it reassures me that: Yes, there is someone out there who thinks about the same kind of strange things that I do.<br /><br />While not as laugh-out-loud funny as his previous essay collections, this book was nonetheless still a wonderful read, especially his journal of quitting smoking. As usual, the only thing I would change about the book would be to make it longer.
0743270754|5.0|\\"Team of Rivals\\" is a very well-written and informative history book.  I believe this book should be considered one of the \\"Great Books.\\"  The rivals to Lincoln were very interesting and capable men in their own right. I love the fact that the author gives Lincoln's rivals plenty of coverage in this book.  My knowledge of the people and events from this important period in US history increased tremedously from reading this book. Highly recommended.
B000VR824S|3.0|I enjoyed the DVD and recommend it to anyone that is a \\"guitar player\\" fan.
B001TH16DI|1.0|Thanks for everyone's thoughts on this release.  I am not a big 'Director's cut' guy, but I will not purchase these films until they have all been restored.  My favorites are actually Voyage home and Undescovered Country. I really don't want to buy all of these films (again) until I can get the best blu-ray picture possible.  Paramount should take more pride in this release on blu-ray. What a shame!
0446579939|4.0|I have enjoyed most of Sparks' novels, so I picked this one up the last time I was at the library. It was a good read. It's a nice love story about a soldier who survives the war, and other casulties, because of the luck brought by a mysterious photo of a young woman. He ends up searching out this woman in an effort to pay her back for saving his life. He finds danger, love and fatherhood. Dispite a somewhat shocking \\"accident\\" at the end, all concludes well.    It wasn't the best book I have read, but it definitely was better than most. Another good love story by Nicholas Sparks. I would definitely recommend it.
B001F7MSFM|3.0|This is a movie unfortunately half done or half baked, whatever you want to call it. But, there were a number of serious mistakes made with the movie. First off, I'm almost entirely sure it came out at the same time as The Dark Knight. This alone probably destroyed most of its box office numbers. It will take you on a ride, but it may not be one you like.<br /><br />Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Story<br />Hellboy II: The Golden Army takes the graphic novel by Dark Horse comics to a whole new level. The story essentially is: at the beginning of time, there were constant wars between the Elves and the Humans. So goblins or something built this Golden Army which was indestructible and only the reigning King of The Elves could command them. So Prince Nuada is looking for this crown so that he can wage war on the humans. This is where things start going downhill. Nothing is ever really explained about Nuada's beef with the humans. The main plot starts getting thinner as the movie goes on. It stays that way for just about the whole rest of the movie.<br /><br />There are a couple of subplots that take place which never materialize. Liz finds out early in the movie that she's pregnant. Then she doesn't tell Hellboy until the almost the very end of the movie. And Abe falls in love with the Elf princess. However, there is only one conversation between Abe and Nuala. My other issue is I never understood what Hellboy's superhero powers were. I know he has a huge hand which is incredibly strong. Maybe I just need to watch the first movie again.<br /><br />Acting<br />This aspect was just barely above par, but what can these actors do with the dialogue they're given? Here's an example: \\"You're the best man I've ever met.\\" And \\"Now, stay down!\\" Who wrote this stuff? I mean I realize it's supposed to be a graphic novel, but you're trying to entertain people that might be older than 13. There is nothing impressive about the acting and it really takes away from the rest of the movie. Even Hellboy's catch lines are contrived and weak. The only person who is able to infue his character with life was Doug Jones who plays Abe Sapien.<br /><br />Fighting<br />This is a large aspect of ANY comic book adaptation to a movie. And again Hellboy II falls well short of expectations. I count three actual full length fights - Hellboy fights Wink, Hellboy fights the Forest God and Hellboy fights the Golden Army / Prince Nuada. There is a small clash between Hellboy and Nuada near the beginning, but it was mainly inconsequential. Even in the fights, nothing impressive happened. Hellboy punched people, jumped over things and shot his enormous six-shooter. Then during the fight with Prince Nuada, he all of a sudden gains incredible spear fighting abilities and amazing speed. I thought he was supposed to be slower and more powerful. Oh well.<br /><br />Visuals<br />Hellboy II would be truly be barely an average movie if not for the imagination of Guillermo Del Toro. The CG is among the best I've ever seen, especially the part with the forest God. There is this giant tree-like creature in one scene and as he attaches himself to building, ferns and grass instantly sprouts up. Around every turn lies a different monster and abnormal or insane creature rendered by the makers of the movie. It's really impossible to explain the depth and realism of the special effects in this movie without you seeing them yourself. The makeup is astoundingly realistic and never once did I question the reality of the characters. It really takes you in to the movie.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I, myself didn't see this at the theatres and honestly I'm glad I didn't. It was another Hollywood movie that clearly had a vision and was lost in the embarrassingly almost retarded (literally, not offensively) dialogue, sub-par acting and an ok plot. Unfortunately, because the visuals were the only redeeming quality I would consider this a rent only movie unless you really love the Hellboy comics.Hopefully if there is a Hellboy III, some of these things will be addressed.essed.
0385340990|5.0|This book caught me from the very beginning.  I feel I know these characters and I'm only half through the book.  It's hard to put down, but I don't really want it to end because it's so enjoyable.  Best thing I've read in a while.  P.  Cooke
B00004RF8J|5.0|This movie is such a classic! If you love musicals this movie is a must-have! It is funny and entertaining for all ages!
B001MYIXAC|4.0|The reviewers that mention issues with subtitles/dubbing are correct. Its a little haphazard. I've never see this flick in any other way than DVD, so I can't compare it to the theatrical. I did notice discrepancies between the dubbing and the english subtitles. Best to watch with the original Swedish audio and English subs...  That being said, I have notices that films made in America are the equivalent of microwave dinners. Flash cooked for an instant meal and tastes pretty good. Films made outside the states are more of a \\"slow cooker\\" meal. This was a good example. I really liked this film. The gore was not over the top and it left you with a few questions at the end (as a good horror film, in my opinion, should). I would certainly suggest this film to anyone who like vampire films, but with a different perspective.
B001IBIQU6|3.0|In the a post-Wilder world, what you get on SOTU is about the best that any current fan can hope for.  It's not the ear-aching headache-inducing mess of PTA, nor is it the sleep inducing misnammed Exciter.  It's not Ultra either, although some of these tracks could be favorably compared to that vastly superior album.  But it's a solid album of raw Martin Gore songwriting.      I'm learning that you can't in good faith compare anything Mode has released since 1998 with anything that came before it any more than you can compare two completely different bands.  (Let's face it, DM should have taken on a new name and moniker after the break-up.)  Interestingly though, if you do, you come away with an appreciation for how a song evolves from inception to final mixed masterpiece.  All of the finished songs since 1998 sound to me like the unmixed demos did during the Wilder era (ironically the deluxe release features a handful of these early demos, handy for just such a comparison).  For example, the demos of Walking in my Shoes and I Feel You are most likely how these songs would have sounded on the master of SOFD had they not first been blessed with the magic touch of Wilder that so enamored me of the band in the first place.  Sadly though, that unproduced rawness is precicely the way the band sounds now.  So, I've decided that in order to enjoy these new albums, I must think of the current band as \\"DM2\\" or \\"Gore & Gahan\\", or they will always disappoint by comparison.  DM1 died when Wilder parted ways, and like it or not, that band is as closed a chapter as the Beatles.    So, judging this album on its own merits, it is mediocre - nothing great - and frankly, nothing that I would have gotten into if this were a debut album from a upstart band.  But it's decent in its own right.  Maybe three stars (four for Martin's songwriting and minus one for Ben's dreary production).  Future singles will have potential in the hands of the right remixers.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I just get a fey days ago my Star Trek remastered complete series and it's simply amazing,  I don't know why so many people disliked when it was an improvemente of 200% over the original stuff, and there's more, for the first time ever, CBS and Paramount did not forget about the spanish talking people that are star trek fans, Congratulations. This series worths every penny.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Great CD, an amazing band, way ahead of their time, great to have this again
B001R60ESE|5.0|This is a first rate DVD in Blu ray and the music is wonderful because Chris Botti plays so well and the Boston symphony with him is over the top great...enjoy!!
0891349553|5.0|When I opened this book I could not believe how true to life the animals are that Katherine Dewey has made for this book. It made me hope she comes out with another book on other animals she has created. My favorite in the book is the fawn and in another area of the book she shows a different way to create a laying down fawn instead of a standing up one by making the legs differently for the body base.    I suggest this book for those who love animal statues that look like they are ready to walk off your table or shelf.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|While I generally agree with most reviews that Casino Royale is superior, this film is a smart companion piece.  It's villain is quietly fierce.  The plot is relevant to the times.  And it deals realistically with the rage of a man with a licence to kill.  Craig does a great job of showing the burning sense of rage below Bond's cool exterior and portrays well how that evolves into Bond's sense of disconnect, hidden behind his air of sophistication.  Smart, sexy and stylish.  Beautifully shot, it looks great on blu-ray.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I bought 50 Cent \\"Curtis\\" instead of this when they had the sales showdown. Ended up buying \\"Graduation\\" used on Amazon like six months later. I would pay $30-40 for this CD if necessary.<br />This album is very good. The beats are so natural sounding and Kanye's raps go perfectly with them. \\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\" is kind of a stupid song but all others are great. Nice change from gangster rap.<br />Better than Curtis.
B001TOD92C|4.0|To be honest I was expecting The Wrestler to be the Rocky of wrestling, but The Wrestler isn't that simple of a story. Rocky is more of a fairy tale while The Wrestler adheres more to reality and doesn't shy away from some of the truths of the world it shows.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson whose glory days of championships and matches in arenas are a long gone. He now wrestles on the semi-pro wrestling circuit which is a weigh station for those wrestlers either on their way down or on their way up the professional wrestling ladder. They wrestle weekends in school gyms, the outcome of the matches is choreographed before they go on, but the toll on their bodies is the same as on the pro circuit of wrestling, and drugs are common to keep their bodies together. This is wrestling where the take from the door is split among 9 other wrestlers and doesn't even pay the rent on his trailer. This is wrestling not for the fame or glory anymore but for the love of the game, what the wrestlers lack in body and success they more than make up for in soul.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei is Cassidy, the stripper with a heart of gold, who is friends with Randy, his only friend, and the irony of their friendship is that they both use their bodies to make a living, although it seems lost to their characters.<br /><br />After a match Randy has a heart attack and he discovers how alone he really is, none of his from the wrestling world even go with him to the hospital, Cassidy has a life and problems of her own, and the daughter he's ignored most of his life and wants to have nothing to do with him, but she is willing to give him one last chance.<br /><br />The climax of the movie isn't your usual sports movie resolution, no exaltation of personal achievement such as in Rocky, no overcoming of the odds to emerge victorious, not even a climatic game that resolves all conflicts and issues within the film. The Wrestler is more about how we choose to live our lives with dignity and doing what we love even though the cost maybe too much as seen from someone on the outside. I can see why this movie appealed to Rourke, he is someone who lived his career as he saw fit according to his own rules, and he paid a price, but maybe that price was worth paying for the awareness and great acting Rourke is brings to The Wrestler.<br /><br />This DVD doesn't contain any bonus features.ugh the cost maybe too much as seen from someone on the outside.

B0006L16N8|5.0|What a masterpiece! Combining the sultry emotion of \\"Viva La Vida\\" the casual beauty of \\"Parachutes\\" and the melodic complexity of \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" Coldplay has crafted a fluid and masterful album in the vein of U2 and even \\"The Beatles.\\"     Highly recommended!
B00005MKA1|5.0|This is such a great recording.. Kaya, She gone.. and so many other great songs. If you're a fan and don't own this, then buy it as soon as you can.... \\"One good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain.\\"
B001E95ZHY|4.0|Rainn Wilson plays Robert Fishman---\\"Fish\\"---the left-behind drummer for the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame big hair band Vesuvius, who was dumped just as the band got its first real break.<br /><br />Fish spends the next twenty years working 9 to 5 and brooding over his bandmates' betrayal. He never touches a drum kit again until his teenaged nephew, in a band called Attention Deficit Disorder, begs him to fill in for the band's absent drummer.<br /><br />Fish agrees. He gives the lead singer, Timothy Geiger, a few new arrangements and some lyrics, and within months, A.D.D. is the biggest act around with a hit record and a national tour. Although Fish quickly readopts his hardcore rocker lifestyle, his young bandmates act as a sea anchor, calming him somewhat.<br /><br />All is well until the band's manager convinces Geiger to dump \\"the dinosaur,\\" and Fish finds himself once again relegated to the bargain bin. But A.D.D. is not Vesuvius, and they quickly lose momentum without their sparkplug. Although begged to return, at first Fish is embittered, especially when he discovers that A.D.D. is to be the opening act for Vesuvius's world tour. But in the end, his love for his young bandmates overcomes all.<br /><br />This is a fine, fun, and goodnatured film in the vein of SCHOOL OF ROCK, and is well worth a bowl of popcorn and a Sunday evening.
B000000OF6|4.0|this was more than i expected. it was a two disc collection and was in good condition.
B00005TT77|5.0|This is an incredible collection of Beatle covers.  There are some great performance on here.....Sarah is great....Ben Harper is amazing.....Eddie Vedder is awesome as well.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This is a high action movie. It has great sound affects. The whole family enjoyed this movie.
B000NVIGC0|2.0|This album is just OK.  There are a couple of quality tunes.....but there is also a lot of filler.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|I liked this movie years ago when it first came out. Now watching it in the Blue-ray is wild. Its truly amazon how the affect of the back ground just pops out of the screen. I'm happy I chose this movie, I recommend it.
6305428352|5.0|I am a middle school music teacher and I actually watch this movie with my kids.  I think it is a great film with a great performance by Richard Dreyfuss.  Highly Recommended!!!
031606792X|5.0|Grand Finale to the best Vampire & Werewolf Soap Opera stories I have ever read in my entire life. I have never wanted to read all the books from the charactors in a movie until now and I am over 40 years old. Stephanie Meyers sure knows how to write great stories.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|This is a solid choice.  I like the story and the actors.  Kind of edge of your seat action.
B001N26GFM|5.0|\\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\\" is a thoroughly compelling film of the highest quality.  It concerns the life of an eight year old German whose father is a high ranking officer in the SS.  The boy doesn't understand his father's task beyond him being a \\"soldier\\".  His naivety, however, slowly comes face to face with reality and, ultimately, tragic consequences.<br /><br />The story is seen through the eyes of Bruno (Asa Butterfield) who leads a normal although privileged life in war time Berlin.  His life, however, changes when his father is transferred to the country as the commandant of a concentration camp.  The family's new home is, to the shock of Asa's mother, very close to the camp.<br /><br />Asa is an adventurous youngster and he quickly finds the camp where, through the barbed wire, he befriends a boy in striped pyjamas.  He keeps this friendship from his family.  Indeed, he has trouble understanding what is exactly happening.  It is this naivety that will produce tragedy.<br /><br />\\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\\" is one of the best films of the past year.  The only criticism that I could have is that it is hard to believe that a child would be kept in a concentration camp.  His work effort would have been minimal.  The Nazis would have promptly liquidated him.  Yet, this criticism aside, the film is utterly engrossing.  It would be churlish to downgrade the film on this point alone.  Overall, the film is magnificent and I recommend it to all.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This show truly is addicting after watching the first episode you have to watch the whole series of course you have to watch it from the begining which is this season. And don't close the door on this show just because you don't like superman I don't like him either, but the show has a very good story for those of you who like to keep an open mind.
B00065F86U|5.0|The BL-3 fits perfectly with EN-EL4a battery in the MB-D10 batter grip.  I don't notice anything when I shoot.  Just incredible amount of battery life for extensive shooting.  IMO, this option addresses long shooting battery life needs and provides fast 8 shots per second.  Shoots longer than NH-CD batteries.  Different color code on the hinges to distinguish battery type.  Works flawlessly--never think twice about it...  Pretty much it.
0764574124|4.0|I have always used Walkenbach's Excel books so when I saw the Dummies guide, I had to give it a try. I am a novice at programming anything but consider myself to be a fairly advanced Excel user.<br />This book certainly provided me with an easy start to Excel Programming. I read it within a week and at the end, I understood all the concepts introduced. The book would be perfect if it had some exercises set at the end of the chapters (with solutions on a CD or website somewhere).<br /><br />Now that I am attempting to utilize this at work, I find that I need a more in-depth book to help me with more intricate programming solutions and to work out the bugs in code that I have written. Notwithstanding, I credit this book with allowing me to understand Excel's full potential and to design spreadsheet solutions (even if I am not yet expert at executing my designs).
B001PJRAUS|2.0|I believe I sat with my mouth hanging open in disbelief for the whole three hours.  \\"Same Story Different Centuries\\"?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Going into details will give the whole story away, but if you are a true Austen fan (as I am), it's difficult to find anything to like in this movie.  The explanation for Amanda's presence/Elizabeth's disappearance is spurious, at best.  Mr. Darcy is borderline evil, and his and Amanda's attraction to each other is a complete mystery.  The only reason I gave it two stars is for the few humorous moments that can be found (for example, Amanda kneeing Mr. Collins in the groin - so satisfying!).  Other than that, it was way too long, and the point (if there even was one) was completely lost on me.  It's only redeeming feature is that it has served to remind me why I have consistently refused to read Austen sequels since that first horrible one many years ago.  My advice: ditch this movie and re-read the novel.  There is nothing better.
B001N26GFM|4.0|As hard as this DVD was to watch the first time, it does not get any easier. This is about two eight year old boys and their innocence. The ending makes one wonder about the parents and their behaviours, our behaviours, our parents behaviours, our childrens behaviours and about our own lives. Not an easy movie to witness.
0689815816|5.0|I remember reading this to the kindergarten class I was a TA for many years ago. The children enjoyed the rhythmic verses and the 'noises'. Now that I have my own 3 yr old I have added this book to her growing collection. It is  the perfect size for her to hold in her hands as I read the story with her. The verses are easy to follow and the pictures are sweet. She just loves to read along with me as she has very quickly memorized it! I highly recommend this book for your 2-6 yr old!
B00005JM0B|3.0|It is always tough to review not only a sequel, but a third installment of a franchise.  Primarily because the novelty of the idea has worn off.  And the \\"times\\" are different.  And the lead actor is now a governor.    That said, I think that director Jonathan Mostow did an admirable job and the movie was fun to watch.    Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kristanna Loken, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes all give nice performances.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|In my opinion, this is a compelling movie.  Don't pay any attention to the review from Amazon.com.  I do not think that the reviewer understood it. I think the movie is fabulously cast and acted.  The screenplay was very good and the cinematography was amazing.  If the Amazon.com reviewer was looking for the unfortunate semi typical sci fi movie with a lot of machismo inspired war scenes between aliens and earthlings, they would not like this movie.  This is a sci fi art film with a creepy dreamlike quality to it.  If you watch it with an open mind, you will see that it gives the viewer the impression that they are watching someone's private nightmare.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|The first half of this movie was really interesting, although it was more of a love story between a teenage boy and an older woman than anything then it tries to be serious.  Hanna is accused of war crimes years later but then it gets stupid, everyone in this movie seems to make the wrong decisions, it just seems implausible on so many levels.  I saw \\"the Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" which was a touching period piece movie about the holocaust, this movie was more about a young boy and his booty call.  Kate Winslet plays an older woman who seduces a young man but when he almost finds out her secret (since when did being illiterate become the worst sin EVER!)  she breaks it off with him.  *SPOILERS*  I just don't understand how a person in their right mind could not even attempt to show remorse when their life is on the line or how not being able to read or write is so embarassing that you would rather go to prison for life.......then if he loved her so much, why wouldn't he even visit her in jail all those years and then act like such a jerk when he finally sees her after 20 years.  Then she kills herself.  It was just one bad decision after another, the characters acted really stupid on all levels.  I do not see why this won the academy award.  it was more about kate winslet's nipples than the movie.  absolutely melodramatic, over the top and illogical.  BLAH!
B001TWT0AE|3.0|This is truely not one of the best Ford westerns.It is a classic as far as the story goes.I'm a 100% John Wayne fan..but..to use a backstage  when the stagecoach is robbed goes back to the early'50's westerns like so many did in those days to save money.Ford wasn't poor...he could have made it a great robbery outdoors..then go to stage probs like the town itself.I love Marvin..he was perfect..with a young LEE VAN CLEEF to help him.Stewart was perfect..And JOHN WAYNE was very good.B/W was great.Howver Sepenic color would give it the age look..like in the opening part of\\"BUTCH CASSIDY & SUNDANCE KID\\".And why is it being brought back out again..I have it already from whenever.Mr.Ford could have use real seneric & give up the expense of WIDESCREEN...I love widescreen..but this movie didn't need it.Oh well.I give it a STRONG THREE STARS. Thankyou, Jack
0446579939|5.0|I have read quite a few of Nicholas Sparks in the past.  This book was great.  It grabbed my attention with in the first few pages.  Usually it takes a couple chapters to get really interested, but this book just gets you and you won't want to put it down.  I recommend everyone to read.
031606792X|5.0|This is the most wonderful series I believe I have read.  I am not sure if I am technically out of the age group these books were intended for since I am 27, but I love them.  They are just so hard to put down once you get started.  Stephenie Meyer did a wonderful job of making you want more.  I read all four books in four days!  I couldn't stand myself, and had to know what comes next.  I had to make myself put them down so I could sleep, but it was difficult. She left you with each chapter and book not able to stop.  Even though, Breaking Dawn ends the series, I still want more.  I want the entire story from Edward's view.  I want to see what happens with Reneesme.  It leave so much to the imagination, and I want more.  I know, as an author, Stephenie is ready to move on.  She has lived with these characters for a long time, and she has developed them and is satisfied with ending it.  It is hard for readers to except that though.  It is just like with Harry Potter or a television series or even movies sometimes, you want to know what happens next.    Addition:    So Bella gets her happy ending.  What is wrong with that?  Stephenie Meyer has brought back the fairy tale romance.  There really aren't any of those anymore and I, for one, miss them.  I am sick of books and movies that end tragically.  People scream that it's not real.  I say who cares.  We get \\"real\\" on a daily basis and Meyer has created a wonderful escape.  Bella definately gets her Edward, her family, and her Jacob in the end, but it doesn't come easy.  A difficult pregnancy where she chooses the life of her child over her own, inspite of those around her wanting her to do otherwise.  What's wrong with that?  That is how a mother should feel.  Even at conception.  We learn that fate or destiny has Jacob and Bella drawn together for a purpose.  It brings the love triangle to an end but gives you so much more.  Finally, we all understand and I find it beautiful that a 100 year old vampire finds love and a family he thought he couldn't have and didn't deserve.  And the conclusion is that of family and friend joining together to take a stand for what's right-or maybe a better way to say it is taking for those they love.  Once again I ask, what's is so wrong with that?  I am thrilled with this book and I am esctatic to find a happy ending today when everyone is so pessimistic.
0553381687|1.0|This book is based on the War of Roses, I think?  Or the hundred years war, more like.  Slow.  Slow. Real slow.  Nothing happens.  This is the first of 3?  Okay, well, surely the other two are shorter and faster paced right?  No?  You mean they're even longer, and slower?  I'll cut my losses and stop reading with this one.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|Jennifer has a wonderful voice and great tunes from this CD.  I received my CD timely, brand new, great price and good music.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|The first time I watched one of the episodes, it was in the middle of the series. Usually, a show with so many mysteries is hard to like if you don't know all the facts, but this show was different. it appealed to me even when I couldn't understand some things that were only explained in previous episodes, because each episode still has its own story. What's not to love about a dedicated agent, a crazy(and humorous) mad scientist, and his slightly annoyed son? Plus the pattern and all those other freaky experiments leave you thinking and wondering what will happen next.    For all those non sci-fi fans, I think this show might change your mind.
B001GM28HO|5.0|This is a very enjoyable album. It's clever and it gets you moving. I would definitely recommend buying this one.
1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is thorough, fun and highly enjoyable. The most informative and straight to the point reading you can find on enlightenment. Would buy copies for my family and friends!
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|This is definitely a five star album. I bought it only being familar with 2 songs. I can say that each song is unique and catchy.   Katy is a new pop star but different and not your typical 'he's-scum-let's-get-back-at-him' clique.   I would definitely recommend buying this album. You won't be sorry. This is one of my new favorites!
0385340990|5.0|This is one of the most charming books I have read in ages.  It is a lesson in history woven into a story about love and relationships.  Definitely a must-read for anyone with a heart.
B001TH16DS|3.0|WHO'S THE MORON'S? YOU FOLKS OUT THERE ARE ARE LIKE SHEEP TO THE BUTCHER! YES STAR TREK WAS AND IS A GREAT CLASSIC, YES THE PRICE IS OK, BUT WHEN YOU ALL REALIZE THAT THIS FORMAT WILL COME AND GO LIKE ALL THE REST AFTER THEY HAVE SOLD AND MADE MILLIONS OF THE \\"BLU RAY\\" SYSTEMS AND THEIR SALES ARE LAGGING THEY WILL RELEASE YET ANOTHER MEDIA TYPE THAT THEY HAVE HAD IN STORAGE UNTIL THE TIME WHEN THEY NEED A MONEY BOOSTER!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This CD is the greatest one so far.  The music is easy....her voice is soothing. It is a joy.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I was let down by this cd.  The selection of songs was very poor.  It was a plethora of old songs done too many times by too many artists.
B0026GBIB6|1.0|I really tried to like this, but after two listening attempts, I gave up. This album is a testament to the fact that the band once known as Depeche Mode has passed away. The memorable melodies, foot tapping beats, layered instrumentation and intelligent lyrics have been replaced with droning feedback, lifeless rhythms and strained vocals. I'm sad to say that there is nothing worth owning on this release and an 80's phenomenon has finally run out of steam.
B000OPOANE|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since I was 11 years old back in the early 1980's.  My first album I owned was Exit Stage Left and the first I bought as a new release was Signals.  I own every Rush album.  Some I love, some I merely like and there's a couple I don't like much at all.<br /><br />This is not one of the latter.<br /><br />I love this album.  It took me about three or four listens to get the album, to grok it, if you will.  I had to accept it for what it was instead of expecting it to be \\"Moving Pictures II\\" or \\"Signals II\\" or \\"Permanent Waves deux.\\"  You get the idea.  Once I accepted it and listened to it for what it was, I was enthralled.  My iTunes tells me I've listened to it nearly 100 times since it came out.<br /><br />Some of the songs I absolutely love and some I merely like.  \\"Good News First,\\" \\"Far Cry,\\" \\"Bravest Face,\\" \\"Spindrift,\\"The Larger Bowl,\\" \\"The Way The Wind Blows,\\" are all, I think, awesome songs.  I'm not very fond of the instrumentals for some reason which is weird because I love the other Rush instrumentals.<br /><br />There is a definitely pessimistic outlook to the album.  But, that's only on the surface.  The optimisism is deeper in that I think that Rush believes that people can still change, the world can still change and we can be agents of change, even if it's only in our personal lives.<br /><br />Sonically, this is one of the best, if not the best, sounding Rush album.  The recording and mastering are way better than the Vapor Trails debacle.  Neil Peart's drumming is subtle but masterful.  If you aren't listening for it, you might not notice just how amazing the drumming is.  In fact, there's no wankery at all in this album.  Just solid songs by master musicians.  I love Alex Lifeson's work here in a way that I haven't in a long time.  And, well, Geddy Lee's bass work is fantastic as always.<br /><br />As a long time Rush fan, this album is one of my new favorites, if nothing else because it is such a high quality and shows that after more than 30 years, the boys still can rock and be relevant.  The songs on here are great and surpass most of the stuff you hear on the Top 10.  If you like Rush, you should buy this album.ock and be relevant.  The songs on here are great and surpass most of the stuff you hear on the Top 10.  If you like Rush, you should buy this album.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one HBO's greatest series ever. This film follows the journey of Easy Company of the 101st Airbourne during WWII. Band of Brothers has hours of action and entertainment. I highly recommend this series!!
0374530718|5.0|Sophie's World is the best book I have ever read. It caught my attention from the very first chapter. This is the perfect kind of book for people like me because I'm not a fan of texts books but in this book you learn history and you have a great story in the same book!     One of the few things I disliked about this book was the amount of pages that it spent talking just about Christianity and even though I understand that it was linked to the material I believe the author could've left some of those parts out. Other than that, TERREFIC book!!
B001HN697M|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  Great action and story.  My favorite of the three.  Going back in time is refreshing.  Recommend to everyone.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This really is an incredible workout! I love that it is an intense short (20 min) workout for busy individuals. However, it drives me nuts that I have to listen to the ads and the entire introduction EVERY time.  There does not seem to be a way to skip past it. So, while the workout is 20 minutes, you need to allow an additional chunk of time for the intro that you have heard a million times before. I should also warn users that the default option on the main menu (when you finally get to it) is \\"Recommendations\\", so you need to scroll down to get to the actual workouts. If you accidentally hit \\"play\\" right away, and try to get back by pressing \\"menu\\", it starts ALL OVER AGAIN with the ads and intro.  Given how good the workout is, I am putting up with it for now. If anyone knows how to get straight to the workout, please let me know!
1400106656|4.0|Loved it.  Got the audio version.  Was great listening to it in dialect.  We never fully realize the lives of others.  I loved Balram.  Can't say the same for all characters.  I have shared the audio with others. Look forward to their reactions.
091581112X|5.0|I have just started reading the Sanaya Roman books.  After reading all sort of different spiritual books for the past 30 years, I am astounded that I haven't come across these earlier.  They are simple to read with simple meditations at the end of each chapter.  Each chapter is very powerful.  I am a convert: I want to read all of them.  I've read Creating Money and Leaning to Channel.  These 2 are very good as well.
1933771690|5.0|A thoroughly engaging, thought provoking, and quite readable work by two great scientific minds.  The idea of Universe as an entity brought into being simply by our own observation of it is, to this reader, irrefutable, and underscores the concept behind Occam's Razor:  The simplest explanation is usually the correct one.
0780626966|5.0|I got this box set for 25 dollars, new, and it showed up early.  Off to a great start already.  Great movies, even if they go downhill in the later sequels, tons of extras including interviews with Clive Barker, Wes Craven, and Sean Cunningham.  MUST OWN.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I now own the complete series and movie and am very disappointed that there is no more!
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Daniel Craig is a stud and one to dream about.  This is so action packed that you cannot turn your head because you will miss something important. I would recommend this to anyone who likes action-packed movies and a stud to dream about.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I missed the whole 'Firefly' series when it came out and just recently found out about it.  I have really enjoyed the whole thing.  I recommend it for fans of science fiction, fantasy, and the wild west!  I can't imagine why fox took it off the air. It was one of the best new shows in town!
B00001OH7O|5.0|This is one of the definitive rock releases of all time.  From the opening chords of \\"Changes\\" to the last song, Bowie's songwriting, Wakeman's keyboards, Ronson's guitar playing and orchestration is second to none.  \\"Oh, You Pretty Things\\" features a piano intro, with sparse arrangements around complex keyboard changes, which break into a poppy chorus.  \\"Eight Line Poem\\" is exactly as imagined, with no percussion, just piano and some slide guitar by Ronson.  It segues into one of Bowie's most dramatic works, \\"Life On Mars\\" with a chromatic dropping keyboard that climbs the other way on the pre-chorus.  The effect concludes in a powerful chorus, with swirling strings and stunning vocals that create an incredible effect.  \\"Kooks\\" has a strong string arrangement that breathes bouncy life into this pop song.  \\"Quicksand\\" is another dramatic opus, with string creshendos and sparse acoustic guitar against Bowie's naked voice.  \\"Andy Warhol\\" has a spoken introduction which bounces from speaker to speaker, before a catchy acoustic guitar lick by Ronson brings us to a tale of Bowie hanging with his buddy, Andy.  Another of Bowie's heros is referenced in \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\", which is written and performed in Zimmerman style to better emphasize the artistic respect.  \\"Queen Bitch\\" rocks from start to finish, with fuzzy guitar and harmonic chorus.  \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\" is the album's most unusual song, a tale of Bowie's brother and his problems with strange loops and vocal effects.  This is one of my favorites, and a true essential release.  You will see it referenced on most credible lists of \\"must have\\" releases.  Enjoy it.
B001IBIQU6|2.0|This disk is so under produced. Most of these songs need a little more kick. Bring back Flood !!! Alan Wilder must be grinning right now.
B000007638|5.0|This is a great live release, that you do not need to be a Wings fan to enjoy.  The band plays hard and tight, with an edge that was not demonstrated on the pop singles and studio releases.  Jimmy McCullough's guitar work, even on pop tunes like \\"Let Me Roll It\\", \\"Call Me Back Again\\", and \\"Magnito and Titanium Man\\" cuts through and seems to inspire McCartney to sing with a stronger pleading urgency than in many years prior.  Denny Lane plays a crucial role as well, signing harmonies as well as playing guitar, some keys, bass and percussion, as well as taking the spotlight on the Moody Blues classic \\"Go Now\\".  The other cover is surprise version of the Simon and Garfunkle song \\"Richard Corey\\", which is done during an acoustic set that includes, \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\", \\"Picasso's Last Words\\", \\"Bluebird\\", \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Yesterday\\".  The release opens with a \\"Venus and Mars\\" into an explosive version of \\"Rock Show\\" into \\"Jet\\", where Paul screams his head off like on the Beatle ravers.  \\"My Love\\" and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" were released as singles, and both were slowed down a bit for dramatic effect live, and the result is magnificent.  \\"Lady Madonna\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" are crowd favorites as well, and their performance live lacks nothing.  \\"Live and Let Die\\" is an explosive anthem, with Tom Scott and the LA Horns blaring against the racing band, and pyrotechnics you can feel even on the record.  There is the collection of Wings hits, some not necessarily as strong as the other material, like \\"Let Them In\\", and \\"Silly Love Songs\\", but Paul's bass and Jimmy's guitar even breath life into those cuts.  \\"High High High\\", \\"Soiley\\",  \\"Letting Go\\"  and \\"Medicine Jar\\" show off McCullough's guitar and vocal talents. \\"Band on the Run\\" is performed to perfection, with its mood and theme changes.  There are other live Paul albums, but this is by far the best, capturing Wings at the height of their creativity, at Madison Square Garden.  Get this!
B00004VW0V|5.0|This gem, issued 1973, well belongs to Cat's most fruitful period - the early 70's - his creativity then culminated. The music, the lyrics, the rhythms (speaking of the Cyprian roots) were extremely straightforward, spontaneous, without any shadow of intelectualism. Many reviewers here put this album quite inappropriately as a then trendy prog rock attempt. In my opinion, this is a sad misunderstanding of what Cat actually did. It may be that only because the word \\"suite\\" appears in the title of the first track (\\"Foreigner Suite\\" - 18 min, i.e. half of the LP/reissued CD), some listeners may deem this to be something very experimental or overcomplicated. However, by no means can this record be compared to what the prog rock groups, such as Yes, Jethro Tull or ELP (as stated in the editorial Amazon.com review), produced by that time. Musically, this has nothing to do with the somewhat experimental music of that kind. The Foreigner Suite is, in fact, just a medley of altogether some 6 tunes, which are now and then connected by several tacts of full-blood music with typical Cat Stevens rhythms, usually produced by Cat's syncopating piano or by woodwinds. These tiny pieces of the \\"connecting music\\" naturally fit to the songs themselvelves; occasionally, one song simply turns to the other one even without this connecting material. Nevertheless, this is still the genuine, typical music of Cat Stevens of that time, full of positive energy and emotion. Only big masters with huge creativity can afford to only gently indicate a catchy motif, and without numerous repetitions and refrains, simply go further (after all, this applies to classical music as well). A lot of pop stars would make a 2-LP of these songs. I cannot agree with e.g. R.L. Miller's review on these pages, indicating that the tunes in the \\"suite\\" were so weak that Cat couldn't make common songs out of them. Wow, the opposite is true. Cat has made sketches of great melodies, and skilfully connected them into one functional composition. Side 2 of the original LP consists of 4 similarly strong individual songs, all 5-star, without a weaker one (this is, again, in common with the 1970 records of Cat Stevens). The atmosphere of earthy happiness from music in the entire album was maybe amplified by the milieu of Jamaica, where all the tracks were recorded (only the strings and brass/woodwinds were added in New York). I think that there is maybe some unifying element, hard to define, over the mood of all the tracks, making this album very special - I have not felt this from any other Cat's album.<br />The booklet brings the lyrics and elementary info- on the musician line-ups on each track. The sound of the reissue is superb and matches to what you would expect of Cat's songs. In summary, I am extremely happy with this reissued version of one of the best Cat's records.

B0000029AL|4.0|I remember when the music teacher in a local Bronx High School (Cardinal Spellman) started to rave about his son's band to my friends who attended the institution.  His son had abandoned his Italian roots, grown his hair long, dressed strangly for the times and chose the stage name Tyler.  He picked up vinyl for anyone who wanted and we took this record home to listen.  I remember as a young musician and enthusiast, I was shocked by the power and range of his voice, particularly on his blood curdling rock screams, as well as the guitar work by the guitar duo of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford.  The band reminded me of a combination of the Stones and the Yardbirds.  Seeing them live at Central Park on a hot Summer night in July two years later, it was clear to see that is impression was correct, from both their material and personna on stage.  This disk was recorded poorly, but the remastered release improves on the muddy sound of the original.  Initially, the disk did not do well, and the single (\\"Dream On\\") was later re-released after the second disk (\\"Get Your Wings\\") made more of an impact.  The results were astounding.  \\"Dream On\\" shot up the charts as a classic rock anthem, and this album was released with a different color back ground, and entered the charts.  For years, folks thought this was actually their second disk because of the timing and the extended airplay the \\"newly\\" released \\"Dream On\\" received.  Although the tune is clearly a rock masterpiece, with it's strong dynamics, great guitar and screaming vocals, this is not the only gem here.  \\"Make It\\" is a strong rocker with a great guitar hook, and Steven Tyler shows his vocal chops where he sings along note for note with the lead at the end.  \\"Write Me a Letter\\" is another ballsy rocker, with harmonica by Tyler and Stones like vocal harmonies on the chorus.  \\"One Way Street\\" features a sparse arrangement of one guitar, vocals, and minimal drums to start, and segues into another driving tune.  \\"Mama Kin\\" has another memorable guitar hook and powerful vocals, making it a cover song choice for numerous bands, including Guns and Roses.  The release concludes with a no nonesence take on the Rufus Thomas classic, \\"Walkin' the Dog\\" done as the heavy handed rocker the boys heard their English influences play.  In all, this is good debut, that suffers from poor recording and production, but a strong indication of the band's future capabilities.  Their sound and arrangements really grow up as they received label backing and budget, especially on the Jack Douglas produced follow up, \\"Get Your Wings\\".

B001ED7C58|5.0|What fun!  Good choices both for the movie and just for listening.  Songs were perfect to set the mood of the scenes so that when just listening, it brought back the fun of the movie.  And Rob Pattinson is an interesting and enjoyable artist.
B00004WG2F|5.0|I received Legends of the Fall and have really enjoyed the movie.  The sender did so in good time and the product was in perfect shape.  It is one of those movies you want to watch again and again.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|It seems to me that most negative comments for this movie come from pseudo-cool college kids that wouldn't know a good movie if it smacked them in the face. No, this is not some Indie movie that makes no sense and has a horrid soundtrack and equally horrid acting. It is a well-produced children's movie based on the adventures of two chihuahuas and a German Shephard in Mexico. The animation for the talking is well-done, even if some of the expressions are obviously animated. Disney has produced a children's movie that adults can enjoy and share life lessons from - such as friendship, acceptance of others, and a new respect for life everywhere.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|THIS is AWESOME! The video of the great ensemble is the best ever!  I put this up on my facebook page and had more positive feedback than anything else I have posted there. This song alone is worth the price of the the album, IT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD to be part of the HUMAN race!
B000B8QEYC|1.0|I dunno why I haven't written a review on this piece of junk before.  I've only owned it since it came out.  In fact, I pre-ordered it before its release since I'm a super Enya fan and listen to the \\"other\\" CD's often.  But this one - I've listened to it once again to see if it was as crxxpy as i had remembered.  IT WAS!  Maybe if I start listing things on the net, I'll be able to unload this and make space for good music.
0780628551|3.0|Commander Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp), an astronaut and a loving husband to Jillian (Charlize Theron), is lost in space for 2 minutes along with his partner Captain Alex Streck during a routine space walk to repair a broken satellite. After coming back to earth, tests are run on them and everything comes up ok on Spence, but Alex's heart takes a beating. He survives, but barely. The recordings that their suits picked up have them screaming in panic, but apparently, nothing happened. During a party that is thrown for the two astronauts, Alex suddenly and quite freakishly dies leaving his wife behind who begins to say some strange things about him to Jillian. As time goes by, an ex NASA employer comes to Jillian to tell her that he's discovered some strange things about her husband Spencer's readings. How everything is the same, but just a tad off. As pieces being to come together, she begins to second guess who her husband really is more and more. Did her husband return from space, or did something else? Or is she just going insane?<br /><br />I like this movie. Yeah, sometimes it felt a little drawn out, but I liked it. Until the ending that is. The whole movie felt very `what if'ish' to me. As in, \\"What if he is or isn't an alien\\" \\"What if she's just going nuts\\". I really don't think you can tell what's going on, until the very Hollywood ending. And when I say that I mean that Hollywood decided we were too stupid to decide on our own what happens, so they just let you know. Up until the ending though, I felt like I was watching a pretty good thriller. When we find out that Jillian had been locked up in a nut house before, you really don't know what to think. And every little thing you've seen becomes a `Well...this could be the reason' sort of idea.<br /><br />In the end I would say give it a rent if you've never seen it. Johnny Depp plays his party really well. So does Charlize, even though it felt and looked like she was doing Devils Advocate at the same time (same craziness and same short hair).<br /><br />P.S. My ending that I came up with would've been really good and I think had made the movie better.and same short hair).     P.S.

B00003CXXP|4.0|Sometime in the future, Monica and Henry Swinton have a child who becomes very ill and close to death. With hopes looking bleak, Henry tries his best to make his wife Monica happy by buying her a robot. Not any kind of robot though, but a child robot. This robot is the first of it's kind. It's the first robot to ever have the emotion of love. While nothing can replace her son, she is at first shocked and mad that Henry would do such a thing. But she accepts this robot. This human-like boy. This David. Before the robot can love though, you have to say some secret words that are programmed into its' database. As she becomes more and more used to David, she decides to finally say the secret words to him. And in just seconds, David loves her. David does everything he can for his mommy so she will love him also. And then sometime later, Monica and Henry's real son, Martin, comes home. The affection and love that the family once had for David, slowly is shifted to Martin. As time goes by, David starves for the attention again for his mother and will do anything for it, even the mean things that Martin makes him do. When things become to get out of hand the family decides to get rid of David. As David's world begins to crash around him, he seeks out the blue fairy that his mom used to read about to him. The fairy that could turn a wooden boy into a real boy. Because if he becomes a real boy, then his mommy will love him.<br /><br />What a sad and great movie. Haley Joel Osment is so good at playing this robot boy it's unbelievable. When Monica is dropping David off in the woods like a dog, I had to turn to stone because I didn't want to shed a tear in front of my friend. Honestly the way I think of David is a dog sort of. They might not have the understanding like a human, but they still have feelings. And seeing her drop him off like a dog and telling him to stay while he's crying and screaming for her and how much he loves her and how he's sorry for whatever he did... well it was just heart breaking actually. Sometimes I feel so bad for David that I have to say to myself, \\"Self, He's JUST a robot.\\" But when he was made, he was given all the emotions that he is almost alive. When Monica tells him the password to love, it was some really good acting on Haley's part. Seeing his sort of weird robot smile face go into a face of getting flowed over with the emotion of love was really good. The first time he's hurt, and he freaks out, and seeks protection, you almost feel it with him with the intensity and shock on his face. I love this part of the movie so much.<br /><br />As others say, the movie feels like there are 3 acts, and it really does. After David is dropped off into the woods, act 2 begins and A.I. takes a total different feel. David begins his search for his blue fairy and comes across Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and many other fascinating and scary places. While David goes through these ordeals, the whole time I'm thinking to myself, \\"Dang, and all he wants to do is make his mom happy and be loved by her, and now he has to go through all this pain, for nothing\\". To me, I kind of wished the movie had stopped at the end of act 2. The whole movie made me feel so sad and lost for this little robot boy, so why not end it there. Then act 3 begins, and while it still makes me sad, it takes away from the more powerful emotions that I had for David. I really don't even want to get into the ending, because, well, it's the ending and I don't want to ruin it (that is if you are one of the few that still haven't seen this movie).<br /><br />In the end, while I keep saying this movie is sad, it's very entertaining in many ways. There are some funny moments, so it's not always gloomy. But yes, it is pretty hard to watch unless you can really detach yourself from David. I for one couldn't. Like I said though, I didn't consider him as a real boy, but more like a pet. I could never just drop my pet off in the woods like Monica did with David. Especially after his begging and pleading. So yeah, definitely give this movie a shot if you haven't seen it yet.<br /><br />P.S. God I want a robotic teddy bear like Teddy.ially after his begging and pleading. So yeah, definitely give this movie a shot if you haven't seen it yet.<br /><br />P.S. God I want a robotic teddy bear like Teddy.
2352500796|5.0|I have been collecting WWII militaria and weapons for over 30 years and I value highly reference books on the subject. This book along with Volume 1 are some of the finest books on the subject I have in my library. Also in a time of $100+ for a good specialty book, they are a fantastic bargain. The pictures and subject matter are fantastic quality and the authors coverage of the QM tags and markings of the items are very valuable. This is a heavy book of the best quality materials and should last a lifetime. Buy both volumes of this series and you will not be disappointed!!
B001GSV3EC|5.0|The perfect JB set list:  rock, blues, jazz, and world music.  He doesn't tour very often so this may be the closest you will get to a show.  We don't hear much from Page but the other two Yardbird players (EC + JB) just get better and better with age.
0671004107|4.0|Contact is one of the most realistically written books of its kind.  A young scientist finds a signal from outer space that appears to be the first \\"contact\\" with an extraterrestrial species.  I won't give any \\"spoilers\\" but the story becomes very political, and dramatic as we see the way the Earth's governments and general population react to this unprecedented discovery.  Everything that happens after the mysterious signal is discovered is very likely what \\"would actually\\" happen in modern day society.  Sagan's writing style is special because he finds ways to give you a history and science lesson as he tells the story.  But he does go into tangents quite a bit, for example he will go off topic to discuss Russian politics for and extended period, but it's still relevent to the overall story.  The Movie is very similar, but the book of course has the wisdom of Sagan's tangents woven into it.
1401201911|5.0|I have never been a die-hard Superman fan, although I enjoyed a few of the movies and the Lois and Clark TV series when I was younger. My stepfather is a lifelong comics fan and got me into The Teen Titans--from there I expanded out into Batman and Nightwing. Those got me interested in Superman, so I began looking for a good Supes book. I was intrigued with the premise of this one and the reviews for it were all very good, so I decided to give it a try. That was an excellent decision! I like the idea behind the story, and it made me wonder what other characters would be like in other situations/time periods.    Now, if you are not totally up on the historical details/facts of the 20th century, then you might be more than a little lost at some points in the book. I had to look up a great deal of information to totally understand what was going on, but that is my only pet peeve. And really, there is no way this story could have worked without the historical events. Look at it as a fun way to learn history.     The art was very well done; the dialogue seemed a little off in places though. And as I mentioned, you might need help following some of the plot if you are not up to date on events. Still, it was a great book and I think every comics fan should read it, Superman fan or not.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|If you take this movie with a grain of salt and ignore the fact it was based on the cult-classic \\"Death Race 2000\\", it's not a bad way to kill 90 minutes. Not having seen the \\"rated\\" version, I don't know what additional footage was included, but it didn't feel as though bits had been \\"slipped in\\".<br /><br />Set in a John Carpenter style future (think Escape from New York), the US economy has collapsed and prisons are all run by corporations, who are, in effect, judge, jury and executioner. Jason Statham is perfect for this minimal-dialogue, lots-of-shooting action flick. The gore was surprisingly tame for an \\"unrated\\" film and rather reminded me of \\"Robocop\\".<br /><br />It was nice to see a more serious actress, Joan Allen, play an evil role. She has the face for it, but it's also nice to see that she doesn't take herself too seriously.<br /><br />The plot is predictable, as is the ending...and no one has to try to hard. It's fast cars armed with rockets and machine guns, hot chicks and violence. Who hasn't wished for all that when stuck in rush hour traffic.
B001993Y2C|5.0|I have noticed many when rating this series, starts off with for enthusiasts...its great; For purists, its not as good...are we talking purists being the scifi fans from the 70's show because if we are, I am one of those and this beats it hands DOWN... its all generational relative, we all watch it with a new set of older eyes and mind.  They should not be compared because you can never relive that feeling from when you watched it as a kid. My last comment is everyone is giving it 5 stars without even knowing what the QUALITY of this blueray transfer will be.  We should have a asterick that indicates we have not seen the actual bluray transfer version yet, because if we are hoping its going to be this pristine print, i think we may be in for a let down.  BSG in its original form the lighting for the show makes everything a bit gritty...you know what i mean...ok enough remambling...you can get the DVD sets of this saga and still be very happy...if your not a high level fan...i of course will buy the bluray REGARDLESS...lol..bye

B001ASVXSE|5.0|Oistrakh's Slavic soul burns through in all these performances.  At first, you might think it a cheap stunt for EMI to include multiple recordings of the same work (two of Beethoven's Triple Concerto in C, one with Oborin and Knushevitsky, the other with Richter and Rostropovich, the second being about a minute longer; two of his Violin Concerto in D, one with Sixten Ehrlin and the Stockholm Festival Ortchestra, the other with Andre Cluytens and the Orchestre National de la Radiodiffusion Francaise, Cluytens adding a good two minutes to Ehrling's pace), but Oistrakh's violin makes each its own masterpiece.  In the works by Khatchturian and Kodaly, among others, Oistrakh turns us all into gypsies.    These are sensational recordings by the most powerful violinist I have ever heard.

B001VB8UAE|5.0|No matter what, you can always depend upon Barbra Streisand to deliver the goods.<br /><br />At one time, she was criticized for her highly emotional delivery of tunes but this boxed set (and let's focus on the 2006 concert) shows that her embellishments aren't trimming - she pours her emotional soul into the songs turning them into fascinating plays.<br /><br />I attended the concert here in NYC and was thrilled (to put it mildly) when her voice - still both powerfully strong and amazingly gentle - managed to wring every emotion out of the songs so that they still sound fresh and new.<br /><br />Ms. Streisand, in show business for almost fifty years now, sings new numbers (Cock Eyed Optomist) and revisits others that she hasn't sung in many decades (of particular note is Have I Stayed Too Long At The Fair - the old Billy Barnes number that is given a fresh new approach by tinkering about with it).  Unlike others, she has grown into her music. In listening to the heart felt way Barbra Streisand delivers such gems as Somewhere or My Man you know that she has taken her years of experenice and is now pouring them into the songs. The song remains the same but it has an added texture and depth that comes with wisdom.<br /><br />For a woman who has recently celebrated her 67th birthday (4/24/09), she still looks, and sounds, fabulous. No.  She looks and sounds BETTER than ever.<br /><br />The three disc set also contains her 1994 concert (you will note how a 12 year span did nothing to diminish her powerful deliveries) and a cable special that was aired to coincide with The Broadway Album.<br /><br />In all, the set is a fascinating look into a truly great American classic.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|I am a recently retired elementary school teacher. I feel bright, gifted children would get a lot out of this movie.  Beatrix Potter did not  \\"fit then norm\\" and so it is so very often the case of gifted children. They actually often \\"beat up on themselves\\" for being different than the average person/child.  I think they will identify with Beatrix's early giftedness in drawing and her intense devotion to it and her insistence to follow it.  So often gifted children are trying to be \\"pushed\\" into the world's mold of average, almost as Beatrix was, and they do NOT fit into the average mold, quite the opposite , their mindS think \\" out of the box\\", very different from most people and yet it is from these gifted children and people that we get our great discoveries in all fields. Think of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and  many others who made discoveries that have greatly added to the quality of our lives.  They were the persistent gifted ones who refused to be pushed by the world into the average mold !  Who would you like to do brain surgery on your brain tumor ? Personally, I'd like to have those \\"out of the box thinkers\\" be encouraged and thus they might become that brain surgeon. They are born with giftedness, let us encourage it and GIVE THEM WINGS TO FLY :)

Every song is imminently listenable and the lyrics are quite strong. The better your audio system, the better this material sounds played at volume.
B001993Y2C|5.0|This isn't a big long review, because I don't do many. But this series is a must see, especially those who are Trekkies and Star Wars fans. I watched the entire series from day one 'with few eceptions' and I could not stand to hardly miss a new episode. The SciFi channel almost ruined it by their off again, on again presentation methods. but I prevailed. So watching from the beginning without all the breaks and commercials will be \\"Great\\". So I can hardly wait for it's release. For Blu-ray the price is not that bad, regular DVD would save us all a lot of $$$'s though. Whether you wait for a while OR buy it now is up to you and your budget. But you won't be disappointed whenever you do buy The Complete Series.
B00008CLOA|3.0|Some songs/passages are impressive (Breathe, Us and Them), others starkly lacking (Time, Great Gig, Money) on this SACD. Instruments are discretely placed in separate channels about as much or as often as they should/could have been, but various vocal sections and instrumental ones are very hushed or subdued to the point of barely being present. And yes, all my channel levels are set correctly. Not like the original, for sure. This is the least impressive of my 5.1 SACD/DVD-Audio discs. Only a minor improvement over the stereo version letting Dolby Pro-Logic II do the surround. Get \\"Avalon\\" or \\"Brothers In Arms\\" and you'll see what I mean. Beatles' \\"Love\\" DVD-A is also quite impressive.

Back home in San Diego, the couple's housekeeper takes their children across the border into Mexico with near-tragic results, while the rifle is traced to a businessman in Japan.<br /><br />The separate-but-ultimately-related-stories technique is similar to that used in the movies [[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash]] and [[ASIN:B000067IZ3 Traffic]] and used just as effectively.  Each story is grim and edge-of-your-seat intense; I don't think I took a deep breath during the whole movie.  All of the actors are excellent as is the location photography.  We see some good, bad, and a lot of ugly in various cultures as families deal with unexpected events.<br /><br />The title relates to the Tower of Babel, where God confounded the people's language so they couldn't understand each other.  Certainly, each story has frustrating moments of poor communication that become matters of life and death.  Though the movie is long, the tension never lets up and I was really caught up in the drama.  Highly recommended.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|I have to say that I was never really into indie rock until I listed to this cd. For emma, forever ago is very dark, but in a good way and I actually like the lyrics (I've noticed that some of the negative reviews don't like the lyrics). because of this cd I sarted listening to other indie rock bands such as vampire weekend, my morning jacket, and arcade fire. I wish more people would listen to this fantastic cd because it is a classic and I can now see why so many online magazines gave this cd perfect reviews. I can't wait to hear more from Bon Iver.
B000ZN8036|5.0|It was a excellent book and end up watching the DVD too. And that was even better.
B0000073BG|5.0|Great music.  I had this album back in the 70's.  This album was my indoctrination to Renaissance.  What a group.  The vocals are wonderful as well as the instrumentation.  I did not realize how bass driven this music was when I had the album.  I never got to see Renaissance live but I have recently seen some of their live performances on You Tube and if you want to know how true the group was to their music you must see the live videos.  Of course I'm only talking about those that have never seen them live.  I envie those who have.
0385512058|4.0|I have heard time after time this is a great book, but I just got a Kindle and I think $14.60 is out of line for a Kindle book as the publisher no longer has to print it, ship it or publish it. It just takes a few cents of storage and transmission time. Plus the book is selling on Amazon as a printed book for over $16. So when the publisher gets around to getting the price to the standard $9.99 I will most likely buy it, unless they wait too long and I find something better to read that matches the price I want.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Like others have said, I too am waiting for the day when MTV/Viacom/whoever owns the rights now, gets a clue and releases this show out on DVD!

So, MTV/Viacom/whoever owns the rights now, please take notice!
B001CISHU4|2.0|I have to say I've never been a fan of Amon Amarth, not to say I haven't tried. I remember buying Versus the World a few years back after hearing Death in Fire (which i thought was an awesome song). The rest of the album however failed to catch my interest thus I've listened to it once, maybe twice. The same goes for Twilight of the Thunder God. It opens with the title song, awesome riff great solo (by Children of Bodom's Roope) The rest just goes downhill from there. All the songs sound the same its mindless chugging with uninspired riffs. This just feels like a lame attempt to to capitalize on the viking theme and sell it to scenesters as a gimmick.    While I find little enjoyment in this i do recommend this to previous fans of the band. Those trying to become acquainted with viking metal Start with Bathory and Enslaved as these are the pinnacles of the genre.

B00011F5DK|5.0|We love this game!  This is a game that the family plays together on game night. My two kids, ages 5 & 8, understand and enjoy developing new strategies to use their pieces up.  GREAT game! Easy to understand, easy and fast for the kids to learn---they even enjoy helping each other out.  Durable.  We keep the pieces in little Ziploc snack bags to keep the different colors separated.
0920668372|5.0|The first time I ever experienced this book was when I heard this story read aloud by a storyteller at a children's event. It surprised me because I found despite it's over the top premise, I wept openly and freely and was moved by its beauty.<br /><br />I bought it to read to my child and was surprised by the negative reviews here.  Most seem to be from people who read the book literally and as such do not understand it.  Many great books, even the greatest book, can be sadly misunderstood and disturbingly interpreted when read that way.  This book is no exception.<br /><br />It is not meant to be understood literally.  It's not the story of an obsessive smothering mother who REALLY climbs into her grown son's home to rock him to sleep at night. It's about how the love a parent has for her child endures and stays with them giving them strength and comfort and security throughout their lives.<br /><br />And it's about the cycle of life and how as we age we all go from loved and cared for to lover and caregiver to loved and cared for again.  This book is not for every parent nor every child.  It's special.<br /><br />It's not a homogenized, inoffensive, safe book of bunny hugs, rainbows, puppies and moonbeams.  This is not that book.  If you want that book get Guess How Much I Love You by Sam McBratney.<br /><br />Love You Forever is quirky.  Read it.  If you love it, buy it and share it with your child.  But be aware that while some children will find it merely silly and sweet, others may find it brings up anxieties about death, dying and loss.  Your mileage may vary with this one.<br /><br />Mine did.  I love this book, but it's not for everyone. Talk to your child frankly and lovingly about the issues this book raises and it will become a much beloved book as they grow.
B001EN71DG|3.0|Star Wars triology were such popular films and still are. Sometimes I can't understand why these sci-fi adventures are such classics but I do enjoy The Empire Strikes Back - the other two I could live without. Harrison Ford became a huge star, too bad Mark Hamill got lost in the shuffle. Star Wars is cool but I've seen better.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|I have been waiting for Stevie Wonder to do a DVD Live Concert.  I saw him in Detroit and it was AWESOME.  The DVD is every bit as awesome.  It is a must have.  I bought a blu-ray and a regular format.

B000002H70|5.0|I have loved this album since the 80's and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.com!!! If you have never listened to this cd you should!! The words, the instrumentation, and overall quality is absolutely amazing.  The Cure absolutely hit perfection with this recording--nothing else is like it.

0385312083|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors.  I would recommend Slaughterhouse-Five to anyone.  It should be required reading.  Although the general concept of the book is a little hokey, it makes for a very entertaining read.  To be able to write a book about something as depressing as war and make it not depressing is a commendable feat.
B000007R1M|4.0|The original proto-robo-dance album. If you don't own this already, what are you waiting for?  [[ASIN:B0027QXQOC Pomme]]
B00004RF8J|5.0|This is a great musical version of Roger Corman's 1960 classic. Directed by Frank Oz,and starring Rick Moranis,Ellen Greene,Vincent Gardenia,Steve Martin,Bill Murray,John Candy,Christopher Guest and James Belushi. While it's similar to Corman's low budget masterpiece there's enough differences that keep it fresh and entertaining!!! Levi Stubbs is hilarious as the wisecracking Audrey II,mean mother from outer space!!! A great musical comedy!!! This great DVD edition includes a great transfer of the film and \\"flowershop\\" of great supplimental material!!! A+
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|It took a few listens for this one to grow on me. Being a fan of their previous releases, I had some high expectations. Was I let down? At first, yes, but over time this one really got into my head. A nice addition to anyone's ambient groove collection.  [[ASIN:B0027QXQOC Pomme]]
B000001DTM|5.0|One of U2's three classic albums along with Joshua Tree and All that You Cannot Leave Behind. The whole is greater than the parts. Maybe their best album. And that says a lot.
B0013FNC38|5.0|This is my favorite cd of the moment.  The lyrics are amazing, Jason Mraz's voice is incredible and the music is great.  Everything gels.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Just got done watching the first episode and I must say it looked very nice.  I watched the remastered version and it did not take away from the story at all.  They did not do what Star Wars did and throw in CGI for the sake of CGI, it was well done.  If you are a purist then you can watch the shows as it was originally aired.  It is nice they gave you the choice rather than making you buy the original and the remastered *cough* you listening Lucas *cough*.    The price is very nice as well.  I paid $62 for this at Walmart and I challenge anyone to find me 7 blu-ray disks worth watching for $62.  To those who claim it is over prices you are idiots.  Last year I bought season 1 DVD for $80.  It is a great deal.
B0023RSZLY|5.0|David Halberstam provides tons of descriptive details, transcripts, sources and viewpoints about this harsh conflict and nations and individuals involved.  Knowing little about this historical conflict, I'm unable to identify information or details that are disputed, considered omitted,nor recognize these differing or conflicting accounts.  As usual, there are conflicting historical viewpoints presented in historical books, such as \\"The Coldest Winter.\\"     There are already so many reviews focus on solely Korea, that below in this review is more mention of China, the American Mainstream Media, Post-WWII US foreign policy in East Asia, and General MacArthur.  All of  are relevant to the Korean conflict and Halberstam spends a lot of appropriate time and detail describing these topics.     I agree with the common opinion that this was and still is, the Forgotten War.  \\"The Coldest Winter\\" highlights the fact that this brutal conflict is seldom referred to, today.    Several aspects about American involvement in the Korean war are elucidated throughout this book, from beginning to end: not to focus exclusively on the negative aspects but there was a lot of American arrogance, ignorance, and numerous miscalculations by many influential military and political leaders who were involved in Korea and China.  Certain aspects in \\"Coldest Winter\\" will remind some readers of US involvement in South East Asia in the 60s, Latin America in the 1950s to 1980s, and in the Middle East since the 1930s up to now.      Halberstam takes the reader to Korea with vivid descriptions of the brutal,  terrain, lethal freezing temperatures, and rugged battle conditions.  A great contribution by \\"Coldest Winter\\" are the lengthy and detailed portions that discuss the Chinese civil war, US involvement in it, and general US foreign policy in East Asia during this time.      RELEVANT TO THE KOREAN CAMPAIGN:    TRUMAN VS. DEWEY CAMPAIGN OF 1948: Truman's 1948 campaign and the State Department's approaches and actions in this conflict.      This book spent a well-deserved amount of time on the 1948 Presidential campaign.  During the 1948 Campaign the political \\"experts\\" and the media gurus did what they still do today: misinterpret campaigns, make incorrect predictions, and think they know more than they actually know.         AMERICAN ADVENTURISM IN CHINA - THE FIRST FOREIGN POLICY DEBACLE AFTER WWII:    Halberstam aptly included lots of information and background on the Chinese civil war and US support for Chaing Kai-Shek, and the influence of the (American) China Lobby inside the USA.  Described, is the Lobby's arrogance and ignorance about Chinese history, culture, and thinking, while it simultaneously and incorrectly denounced Truman for \\"Losing China.\\"  This divisiveness reminds one of the partisan media spin so often promoted from Washington, the mainstream media,  and political talk-TV and talk-radio today.      And like today, the military works in coordination with the mainstream media to promote Military-Industrial Complex and State Department propaganda.  General MacArthur interviewed with \\"Life\\" magazine in 1948.  The headline on the cover of \\"Life\\" magazine was, \\"MacArthur says fall of China Imperils US\\" (p. 215).  Hungry, impoverished, largely illiterate peasant china, imperiling the US?  In 1948?  Imperiling a world super-power that has the atomic bomb, natural resources, and more technology?  Laughable.  Yet very influential on manipulating the US public.  Like then, as now.    To reinforce this point, \\"The Coldest Winter\\" delved into another issue rarely discussed regarding the Korean conflict and China: the US government's misinformation provided to the American public in the US to garner public support of Chaing Kai-Check.  In reading the details of Chaing, his tactics, army, and character, I found it similar to involvement in Vietnam (1965-1973), Iran (1953) Guatemala (1954) Chile (1973) and Iraq (Chalabi), and al-Hakim, (2003-2009).      US support of Chaing was a debacle.  Billions of dollars of taxpayer money disappeared.  The US funded supply lines that were stolen by the Communists, and Chaing and his officers stole from the US constantly.  Often in the annals of post-WWII American foreign policy and interference, the US has bet on the wrong horse.      While Korea is the forgotten war, I call this era, the forgotten debacle of  post-World War II American foreign policy.      MAINSTREAM MEDIA: CREATING MYTHS THAT INFLUENCED AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION:    It's universally agreed upon today by objective historians that MacArthur was a disturbed individual, an ineffectual desk General, and an overrated egotistical self-promoter. One of the many myths disseminated to the American public in the 1940s and 50s via the mainstream media (MSM) was that MacArthur was a brilliant, competent man, that was highly respected by those with whom he worked, and knew.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  He had then and still has, an atrocious record and reputation.     In accordance with other historians, Halberstam repeatedly notes MacArthur on the surface being an icon with enormous aura and influence.  Yet he was out of touch with his peers, subordinates, and people of the United States.   Living and working in Tokyo with his inner circle of sycophants, focusing on rebuilding and molding Japan in his own image.  He knew and cared little about Korea.      General MacArthur made many military and intelligence miscalculations.  MacArthur openly claimed to \\"understand the Oriental\\" mind, even after many  mistakes made with the Japanese previously.      Referring to n the Korean conflict, one American soldier there stated, \\"in  WWII everything was done right, and in Korea everything seemed to be done  wrong.\\"  Soldiers sent to Korea lacked proper Winter clothing, lacked  ammunition, and had old, outdated guns and weapons. Supplies often came late, and sometimes never at all.  In Korea and throughout history, the soldiers pay the price for the blunders from the top. The rugged mountainous Korean terrain, and harsh Winters were major factors that gave the initial advantage to the North Koreans.  Cornered in Busan, the Inchon landing is quite a historical feat, and perhaps the one and only move by MacArthur that paid dividends.     \\"The Coldest Winter is lengthy and has lot of info and helpful strategic maps.  This is a good book, and unfortunately, was David Halberstam's last.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Another in a long line of Bond movies. Great scenery and the usual hot co-stars.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Regardless of what anyone says, The Devil You Know is the fourth Black Sabbath album featuring Ronnie James Dio on vocals despite the change in the band's name. The only reason they are going by the moniker Heaven and Hell is because they do not want to be bothered by Ozzy-obsessed fans when playing live.<br /><br />Just like its predecessor, Dehumanizer, the album was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales in only three months, which has given the band the chance to capture a rather live feel which is both intense and powerful. The band did take a longer time to write the album though, partly in England and partly in the USA.<br /><br />The Devil You Know expands on the classic Sabbath sound, chock full of thunderous riff work, stomping drum intensity, growling bass lines, and godly vocals. This album once again solidifies the fact that Dio is and always will be the voice of Heavy Metal. He is in fine form here, slightly straying from his style on his recent solo material, and revisiting his glorious past where he exerts a doomy vibe on some of the tunes that fits the compositions like a glove.<br /><br />It all begins with the sonic punch that is \\"Atom & Evil\\" (Adam & Eve) whose rolling drum intro suggests the production on this disc is huge and powerful. Everything sounds crisp; the range of dynamics is great and the instrumentation very vivid. As Iommi lays down his unique riffs, a dark, menacing atmosphere is achieved and perfected with the arrival of Dio singing lyrics of abstract symbolism. Note the use of discreet synths in the background, proceeding through a terrain of rhythmic power. Also pay attention to the mini-riff that is planted beneath Dio's vocals on the chorus. That riff doesn't let go till the end -- it is absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />Being a fan of Sabbath's darkest and heaviest material, tracks like \\"Follow the Tears,\\" (what a great, great song!) \\"Bible Black,\\" and \\"Breaking into Heaven\\" are the album's most shining moments. The heavy, almost sludge-infested opening riff of \\"Breaking into Heaven,\\" once again complete with metaphorical lyrics about fallen angels trying to break into paradise, is a modern take on doom metal while the intro of \\"Follow the Tears\\" is so heavy that it would crush just about anything that gets into its path. Iommi will always be the god of riffs, as his writing has been unparalleled for over thirty years. He unleashes riffs, rhythms, and solos unlike any other guitarist in the world. His acoustic guitar playing on \\"Bible Black\\" is stunningly dark, as is his volatile, chugging lead solo that follows it. The way the song builds from a pain-ridden dirge to a monstrous finale induces goose bumps every time. Add to this Dio's vocals that recall his stuff from his most underrated album Strange Highways and Iommi's schizophrenic solo and you have a masterpiece of composition.<br /><br />Geezer Butler mostly stands out on the bass-centric \\"Double the Pain,\\" again with vocals reminiscent of Strange Highways, where he lays down a sick, stomping bass solo. Likewise, it is the bass that permeats \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" which boasts a shred-intensive guitar solo that erupts like a volcano following the patient build-up. This would make for a perfect live performance given the energy between the drums, bass, and guitars.<br /><br />About the other songs, \\"Eating the Cannibals,\\" the shortest song on the album, is the loud, in-your-face number, retaining its heavy drive from start to finish while \\"Fear\\" sees Dio's most theatrical singing highlighted with awesome drum fills by Vinny Appice (whose work on the earlier albums is much, much better -- perhaps the best drumming in Heavy Metal).<br /><br />Admittedly, \\"Rock & Roll Angel\\" and \\"Neverwhere\\" lack the same intensity and songwriting bliss of the other tunes, but the lead solo on the former is arguably Iommi's finest on this album as it recalls his blues-inflected playing on Mob Rules quite a bit, and the latter is a hook-laden, catchy rock anthem into which scalding riffs and slamming drums are tucked.<br /><br />A great entry into the mostly brilliant Sabbath catalogue. Though at this point, I rank it below the other three albums with Dio, this is still one of the best Heavy Metal albums of the year.are tucked.    A great entry into the mostly brilliant Sabbath catalogue. Though at this point, I rank it below the other three albums with Dio, this is still one of the best Heavy Metal albums of the year.

B001KP2Y3K|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because while I really enjoy this album, I do not love it as much as I have her others.  The first song is fantastic and so are many others I just didn't feel I could give it a full 5 based on the fact that I cannot listen to it straight through and love every song, I love most songs so really if I could have I would have given this a 4 1/2 star review.  SO if you love Madeliene you will not be disappointed.

B00177Y9ZC|4.0|Jumper is an action-adventure story about a man who can teleport from one location to another at will just by thinking about it.  The movie chronicles the life of this \\"jumper\\" from the day he learned of his ability while in school, through his exploits using his skills, to his final confrontation with his mother, who is a paladin; someone who hunts down and kills jumpers.  Our jumper is played by Hayden Christiansen, who puts in another fine job that again demonstrates he is a good actor, contrary to what George Lucas did to him to in the most recent Star Wars movies.  The Paladin who hunts him is played by Samuel Jackson, who I believe has played in one too many roles as a government agent.  This movie did not fare well at the theaters; unfortunately as it is very good.  The script is original, and the acting is decent.  All in all, a good watch.

Every person wishes at some point in their life that they were more beautiful or that they could just change something on their body. Westerfeld takes this idea and turns it around on us.

B001UREJWM|2.0|I am a HARD CORE Sabbath fan. I own ALL studio albums from ALL eras. In fact, I flew out to Vancouver for the first H&H gig in '07. That said, on to the review:    My first impression is that this is a weak album, and that they were short on good ideas. I will not review each song, but I liked \\"Bible Black,\\" but things went down from there. It seems there is little imagination to the songs, and even less in the lyrics. I had heard this disc was going to be a cross between Mob Rules and Dehumanizer, but there seem to be no knockout songs on this.     I have no issue with the performance, and the production seems good. I just had my expectations too high. Dehumanizer was WICKED, this just seems tired. Rock n Roll Angel? Are you kidding me? It sounds like a lame Dio song. I liked this disc less upon second listen. I hope it grows on me. I do think the last two songs have promise, I will have to listen to them again.
1416914293|5.0|My friend introduced me to this book and couldn't stop talking about it, now I see why. I could not put this book down from the first page I read. I love the world Clare images, the characters are so developed that you know these people to a T. I just couldn't get enough of Clary and Jace even with the weird sibling insect thing that Clare through at us. When I found out that they were brother and sister I actually couldn't read anymore because I was so upset, lol they were just meant to be together. I really could not find a flaw with this book, beside that the second one didn't come out soon enough.

078401213X|3.0|\\"I concluded that I might take as a general rule the principle that all things which we very clearly and obviously conceive are true: only observing, however, that there is some difficulty in rightly determining the objects which we distinctly conceive\\" Rene Descartes 1637. An intense obsession to discover the greatest secret of the universe is really more about greed than curiosity, and that's what this film clearly depicts. But this film is deeper than that, and weirder than that. In the end this genius, through a desperate act, gives up his faith in chaos by surrendering to chaos instead. And finally he is free. I think this film missed greatness by spending too much time on artsy filming and the sheer madness of the lead character, which is explained almost not at all. So it makes me wonder if this film could be inspired by what old mathematicians tend to say. \\"As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality\\".

031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is one of those stories that only come around every-so-often. The two lead characters have become icons with Bella being a character that girls can aspire to be like. Yet, while Bella is the lead, it is Edward the dominates the story.    I think Stephenie Meyer missed a golden opportunity to develop him further. Breaking Dawn would have been much better if she wrote the story from Edward's point of view.    Nevertheless, Stephenie Meyer, knows how to develop characters and keep the story flowing. The only bad news is that the series has ended. Other than that, I can't recommend this book and the series high enough.
B00005NGZX|2.0|So me and my girfriend decided to check out some cds, on bestbuy, having forgetten our ipods, our car stereo not working, i coulnd hear any music and the samples on the cd section were,  \\"out of order\\", of course. I went in the progressive rock section, there was  six copies of Converge's \\"Jane done\\", not knowing this band or never having heard any of their music, i bought it. Looking at the cover art and having read the lirycs, i thought to myself, \\"hmmm this band seems interesting\\", so when i was getting ready to burn the cd, i was extremely dissapointed. I dont realy understand, never did get, the concept of some bands vocalist, screaming through a whole entire album. Why scream your lungs out and play your guitars so fast, that you cant really understand or even hear the music being played, why?????? I quess thats why the extreme music scene, is not very known or even liked, cause its unbearable. Two stars, cause the lirycs are extremely intelligent and well the drums were good, the bit i could hear, it was decent but nothing truly great though. Guitars need to slow down and vocals need to stop screaming, and actulling try singing the lirycs so people can hear you and understand what you are trying to express, in your music.
0307474275|5.0|Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is quite possibly the greatest marriage of historical facts and historical fiction. Without revealing too much, I'll begin.<br /><br />In its basic form the Da Vinci Code is about a secret held by the Catholic Church...a secret that can change the world. It all begins in a Paris Museum and goes from there.<br /><br />Clues are discovered and left in a way that a definite pattern emerges, and it is as if we are being led down the path of what just might be the greatest secret. You must remember though, this is a book of fiction. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll find one of the best novels written.

Mickey Rourke was great as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a well-seasoned wrestling legend, who has been on a roller-coaster ride too many. This film also gives strong performances from Evan Rachel Wood-Who plays The Ram's estranged daughter, and Marisa Tomei-who plays his strip-dancer girlfriend.<br /><br />I've been a fan of The WWE since the day \\"WrestleMania\\" was born. And before that, The big matches were held at MSG, when Hulk Hogan defeated The Iron Sheik, and the rest of the story became history. My Late Grandfather was a devout wrestling fan, he tooks his sons out every Friday Night to The Coliseum, and I have pretty much followed in his footsteps.<br /><br />And Bruce Springsteen's very poignant song, really does tell the story. This Movie is a definite keeper, and a must-have for All wrestling fans out there.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|. . .but i know, a change is gonna come.    As a student of music and education, I could not agree more with the message of peace and unity through music that Playing For Change is presenting. All of this music is wonderful. What an inspiration to us all.
B000002IJO|4.0|Basically Ratt have a downward trajectory that's almost a straight line.  Their first album \\"Out of the Cellar\\" was their hands-down best - and their later records just get progressively a little worse over time.  This record was made when Ratt was still on the favorable end of that curve.    If you like \\"Out of the Cellar\\" and \\"Invasion of your Privacy\\", this record has the same sound, Beau Hill production, and hedonistic anthemic feel that made Ratt such a great band in the 80's.  So if you know that sound, and you like it, you will enjoy this record.  If you're new to Ratt,  I would recommend picking up their self-titled debut before this one.  Avoid their later output, because most anything they've done without Beau Hill is mediocre at best.  In fact, Ratt in my book basically has 4 albums worth owning: \\"Out of the Cellar\\", \\"Invasion of your Privacy\\", \\"Dancing Undercover\\", and \\"Reach for the Sky\\" - but I digress.    Truthfully,  this album gets an unfair amount of criticism, as there's a lot to like here.  For one thing, the album plays better than any other Ratt record from beginning to end.  Individually, the songs themselves, with a couple exceptions, are just ok, but the songs are sequenced in the first half in a way that draws you in from the anthemic but sort of forgettable \\"Dance\\" - which immediately seques into \\"One Good Lover\\" - the best song on the record in my opinion, and good enough to buy the album for, to the energetic \\"Drive Me Crazy\\" which showcases the rhythm section a little bit.  Although the guitars and Pearcy's voice really define the sound of the group, these guys are all capable musicians in the studio - at least they were when this was made before drugs and sex addictions started to rip them apart.    We slip back into average with the mid-tempo \\"Slip of the Lip\\" and pick up again for \\"Body Talk\\", which leads into \\"Looking for Love\\", which is another good 150 BPM metal anthem.    Unfortunately, this is where things drop off.  The album continues on with respectable Ratt anthems that stand well together but not as well on their own.  \\"Enough is Enough\\" is the only minor standout, which of course, they put at the very end of the record.    Overall, I've got an admitted soft spot for this group and continue to hope that they'll put something out today that would even approach this record or any of their earlier output in terms of quality (rumor has it that there is, in fact, a new album in the works for 2009) - for change has not been good to them.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album is essentially flawless, the cohesion of the album is just incredible, the albums tells a story better than any other album I have come across!  The lyrics, vocals, guitar, bass, drums, samples, keyboards are all just perfect.  The lyrics are probably the thing that may jump out most at people who really pay attention because they are just beautifully done, Manson is a real lyricist, a poet at heart you might say.  As far as the rhythm section it is just awesome, Twiggy Ramirez is one of my favorite bass players, he is just awesome, and Ginger Fish is an awesome drummer, but his contributions only really felt live!  Also, the guitar work is very brutal especially on the songs that Twiggy played , which is most of the album!  Twiggy wrote most of the songs, played bass on all, and played lead and rhythm guitar on many, so his contributions are extremely felt!  Trent Reznor produced this album and wrote a few songs and performed on others, and you can definitely hear a NIN influence on this album!  Daisy Berkowitz plays guitar on Irresponsible Hate Anthem, Tourniquet, Wormboy, and parts of Man That You Fear and Mister Superstar!  The album is very heavy in many parts, very goth and dark in many parts, and very melodic throughout, if you like dark goth industrial metal melody!  This album has a bit for everybody, whether your a straight up heavy metal person, an industrial enthusiast, a goth enthusiast, a hard rock/alternative fan, or just a general rock fan!      There are very fast, brutal hard rock songs that are just moshing heaven like Irresponsible Hate Anthem, The Beautiful People, Little Horn, Angel With the Scabbed Wings, and 1996.  There are songs that are just an incredible mixture of heaviness, darkness, but of slower tempos in parts like The Reflecting God, Dried Up, Tied, and Dead to the World, Deformography, Mister Superstar, and Antichrist Superstar!  There is one very experimental song with incredibly unique and inventive guitar parts in Wormboy, which was Daisy Berkowitz's finest contribution to this album before he exited Marilyn Manson.  There are some straight up goth songs like Cryptorchid, Minute of Decay, Kinderfeld, and Dried Up, Tied, and Dead to the World(which I already mentioned).  Lastly, there are some incredibly melodic songs that show Manson's affinity for dissonant, dark, and heavy but extremely melodic music like Tourniquet and Man That You Fear!  This whole album is flawless, play it through for the best effect, and there is absolutely no weak links, the only album that I can listen to all the way through without even the thought of skipping a track.  The highest highs of the album would have to be:  Irresponsible Hate Anthem, The Beautiful People, Tourniquet, Deformography, Mister Superstar, Angel With the Scabbed Wings, Antichrist Superstar, The Reflecting God, and Man That You Fear!  Recommended to anybody who listens to rock music, this album is just that good.  THE BEST ALBUM OF THE 1990S, WITHOUT QUESTION!!!  P.S.:  Look out for Manson's new album coming out in May this year called the High End of Low, he is reunited with Twiggy so I have very high hopes for it!
0385613857|2.0|I loved the first two books of this series, but this book is really lazy.  It is bloated and does not say anything.  I think Christopher was have too much fun to really write a good book, and had to meet his publisher's deadlines; really disappointing.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is by far the best comedy/drama on television right now! I can't wait to get my DVD's so I can check out all the extras! Nathan Fillion (Castle) and Stana Katic (Becket) have such fantastic on screen chemistry. For these two it seems like it's not a matter of if they'll get together (or beat the heck out of each other) but a matter of when. Awesome, just awesome!
B001MW0J2O|5.0|The eighth album is a success.  Merriweather Post Pavillion is the best thing Animal Collective has created so far.
0316067601|2.0|To begin with, thanks to Marcus and his military brothers for their service to their country.  They are an honor to country and family.      That said, as a military academy grad I have good friends, brothers, who share the myopic view of the world that the writer chose to immerse us in (\\"anyone who doesn't agree with me and everything I do is weak\\").  While it is a necessary part of what it takes to succeed in that line of work, it doesn't make for terribly interesting reading.  Lots of red meat for the meat eaters. With all due respect to the author, those of us who were looking for a good read and insight are left with page after page of testosterone soaked chest thumping.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I guess my expectation maybe a little high after the last album 'Playing the Angel'. It is not as great as the last one but I will say it is still worth listening to. DM does sound differently from one album to album. I like the 'Fragile Tension', the ones I like most are the bonus tracks though 'Light', 'Oh Well', and 'Ghost'. 'Ghost' has the tune like those songs 'Shake the Disease' or 'It's called a heart' that you can't get it out of your head! Listen to it you will know what I mean. Oh well, overall it is a good album.
B0026GBIB6|3.0|Amazon.com recently began to attract me to its MP3 store by offering low-priced, new releases. Being only familiar with the Depeche Mode singles \\"People Are People\\" and \\"Enjoy the Silence,\\" I had no strong opinion of DM's work. My tastes in college during DM's heyday tilted more toward Prince, Springsteen, Mellencamp, and Dire Straits. After sampling a few of the songs on Sounds of the Universe, I decided to take a $3.99 chance on the new music. Surely I would come to like at least four out of the thirteen songs. \\"In Chains\\" grabbed me after only a couple listens with its steady build and electronic feel. It is my favorite song on SOTU. I also am coming to enjoy \\"Peace,\\" \\"Perfect\\" (which has a Duran Duran vibe to it), the gentle \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"Fragile Tension.\\"  My least favorite are the heavy-handed \\"Wrong\\" and the repetetive \\"Miles Away.\\" All in all, I am pleased with my introduction to DM and am interested enough to explore music in their earlier catalog.
B001TH16DI|1.0|I bought the special editions DVDs when they came out... Why would i buy this inferior product? 1080p is definitely cool, but it's as much about the actual movies as the technology. Inferior content with better technology just doesn't cut it for me. I can wait a couple of years to get the right package. Look at how the Star Trek Original Series was released on Blu-Ray! That's what i call a great release. For this one, thanks but no thanks: i'll wait.
B0016OMFPW|5.0|When I first saw that Amazon rated this as the top jazz CD of 2008, ahead of Esperanza Spalding's amazing offering, I took notice, especially since I was already a fan of Roy.  While I don't think this is as good as Esperanza's CD, that just says a lot about how great Esperanza's CD is because this one is fantastic.  It's one of the best CDs I've bought in a while.    Although I like every song on here, they really start to get good with the third song, \\"Strasbourg/St. Denis\\", while Gerald Clayton shines on the piano in the next song (as well as several others on here), \\"Starmaker\\".  After the very mellow \\"Joy Is Sorrow Unmasked\\", the pace picks up nicely with \\"The Stinger\\", then slows right down again with \\"Rouge\\".  \\"Mr. Clean\\" and \\"Style\\" both have quite the old-school feel to them before he slows it down beautifully again with \\"Divine\\".    Near the end, \\"To Wisdom the Prize\\" is another where Clayton really shines alongside Hargrove, and the conclusion, \\"Bring It On Home To Me\\" feels like a great close to a CD - and it's fitting because this is a great CD.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|The scene between Arthur and John, when John confesses his love for Little Dorrit and reprimands Arthur for his blindness to her feelings for him, is an example of true artistry that actors should watch to perfect their art. Wow. Worth the price of the DVD for that scene alone. This production has many, many wonderful scenes. Another favorite of mine was Mr. Dorrit's relapse back to the Marshalsea while at the social gathering in Italy. Great acting! Thank you, BBC!
0321543726|5.0|This is the best introduction to C++ I've read (and I've read a few, including Accelerated C++ and C++ Primer). For a start the book is beautifully presented with color used liberally throughout and even color photographs in places. There are also plenty of pictures and diagrams to illustrate techniques.    It's big at over 1200 pages. But the text is not dense so you can actually read chapters fairly quickly. There are 4 parts as follows:    1. Basics  2. Input and Output  3. Data and algorithms  4. Broadening the view    Part one contains the fundamentals of C++ and also describes designing a parser to calculate arbitrary expressions. This is surprisingly complex, involving tokenizing a grammar.    The I/O section is excellent because it describes how to design GUI classes and also how to use the real-world FLTK GUI library to produce windowed programs. Of course it also describes traditional text mode programming using iostreams.    Part 3 contains an excellent chapter on designing a vector class, then discusses how the STL vector template solves a lot of the problems. This is a theme of the book - Stroustrup attempts to explain the underlying reasons why things work the way they do, rather than let the reader rely on \\"magic\\".     The book describes a lot of good techniques like RAII, regexes (using boost and which will also be in the next C++0x standard) and exception handling. The goal is to give the reader the skills to be able to create robust modern C++ programs that can be used by other people. Hence the emphasis on correct exception-safe code.     Part 4 discusses numeric programming and embedded programming. These are interesting chapters but possibly niche. There is also a chapter on test harnesses and unit testing, which is something a lot of intro books leave out. There are also a couple of \\"trivia\\" chapters related to the history of programming which I found very interesting.    So, in summary I'd say this book is an excellent resource for the beginning C++ programmer (or even an existing one who needs a refresher).
0596527055|5.0|This book is great, it's the book of kind you will finish it in one reading session , it discuss the myths that realated to the history of innovation, how this innovation happen, and how this innovation spreads . Scott Berkun writing is very funny and informative. in each chapter he discuss one myth like (the magic moment, people love new ideas, good ideas are hard to find ... etc ) and how people spread this myths and what's the truth about all this myths, it's a must read book for who working in the innovation industry , and writers who spread the myths and anyone want to make the next breakthrough in his field , recommended .
B001IBIQU6|1.0|If this is the Sounds of the Universe, then this is our first confirmation that our universe is indeed headed towards an enthropic \\"heat death\\" for sure.    Another reviewer had laid this a rather scathing label as \\"noodling\\" for this album and I sadly have to agree.  The only redeeming quality on this album is its first song which sounds like it's about to explode into something beautiful, but then it hits this bridge into a black hole which then begins to typify the rest of this album.    Was this stupefaction brought on by alcohol?  A bored night at the pub?  The latest purchase of shovel-ware loop sounds for the PC?  It's really nothing to write about and much less listen to.    Honestly, after 5 tracks (and then repeatedly with each, newly-induced coma of a track), I actually asked my car speakers, \\"Are you even trying?\\"  Apparently not.  Depeche Mode has given up trying and has practically thrown in the hat with each subsequent release after Violator/Songs...Faith/Devotion.      They are not the same band anymore and what they are actually charging for concert tickets is absolutely shameful considering that they can only cash in on their past masterpieces.  This album is certainly not worth going to a concert for, much less actually buying for private use.    It really is that bad.  The 30 second previews don't do it \\"justice.\\"  I want my life back because Sounds of the Universe took it from me...Depeche Blowed.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I REALLY LIKE SOME TUNES ON THIS CD. OTHERS ARE JUST SO-SO. THE TITLE SONG AND THE ONE PRECEDING IT ARE THE BEST ON THE DISC.     SOMEWHAT MOODY AT TIMES, BUT OVERALL A NICE EDITION.    LOVE THE COVER. VIVA LA REVOLUTION !
B000MRAAJM|3.0|For a \\"breakthrough\\" series meant to tout it's high definition picture, this Blu-Ray disk is very dissapointing.  Why didn't they produce with full 1080p ?!  The picture looks way too soft.  Also, the center channel output is set too high.  Ms. Weaver's voice is too pronounced and the rest of the soundtrack is barely heard.

B001K3JF7K|5.0|I have to admit I read several extremely negative reviews on Ms. Krall's latest effort, \\"Quiet Nights\\", before making my purchase last week. Like many, I pretty much own everything she's ever done, and have never been disappointed. Was this going my first let down?? Those reviews sure had me worried.   If you an ardent fan, worry not, because Diana once again delivers. If you like a soothing female voice, singing well arranged numbers backed by magnificent strings, then you cannot go wrong with \\"Quiet Nights\\". Personally, I even prefer the return of the strings section vs. the brassier tone of her most recent efforts. I also like the fact Diana does quite a bit of silky piano work on each song.   Forget these reviews. \\"Quiet Nights\\" is a winner.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I live in the U.K. and the Box set has already landed here. I can say that the negative reviews on Amazon need to be curbed especially if you have not seen the product. To be quite honest Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection is truly magnificent. All six films look fresh and sound phenomenal. I was not expecting much based on all the venom spitting going on here but I am glad you naysayers will be proved wrong. These are the theatrical features as seen in movie theaters and that satisfies me down to the ground. Each transfer is near meticulous some minor dirt on the photo chemical opticals for  Star Trek The Motion Picture, but on the whole very, very satisfying. sonically you have not heard Trek like this either. A treat for the eyes & ears. Sell your DVD copies because this is quite honestly worth the asking price. Thanks Paramount.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|This is a great plug-in, listen start-to-finish album.  All of the tracks are solid, yet different enough one to the next to keep your interest.  Indeed, I find something new I like just about every time I listen.  Guitarist Nils Cline brings a great new dimension to Wilco.  His playing is very original if sometimes uncontrolled.  Tweedy's lyrics are sometimes too introspectic and, well, depressing.  But they are definitely deeper than the average lyrics without being heavy-handed.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|Fear Of Music.  You hear the title and it seems a bit silly.  Fear Of Music.  Who fears Music?  I've lived with this music for 30 years now and can say that I now completely understand the title and it is absolutely brilliant.  The title first triggers thoughts of how ridiculous it is to fear music, but ultimately it triggers a new perspective.  Wait a minute.  The PMRC, The Bible Belt, Radio Stations,  Church Organizations, etc... ARE afraid of music.  They among others want to burn it, ban it, and banish it.  Censorship.  The song \\"Electric Guitar\\" sears with a vengeance while addressing this horror.  David Byrne sings, \\"This is the meaning of life\\".  He means it.  The more I listen to this music the more  I treasure it.  Songs like, \\"Heaven\\", \\"Animals\\", \\"Air\\", \\"Memories Can't Wait\\", \\"Paper\\", \\"Cities\\" and \\"Electric Guitar\\" are all songs with subject matter that at first seem benign and pleasant.  First impressions often lie.  The subjects are much more complicated then they first appear.  After repeated listens the music and lyrics weave their way into your brain creating a surreal escape from these unrecognized hazards.  Byrne uses sarcasm, expresses paranoia, and uses joyous humor to accentuate true iconoclastic messages in every song.  \\"Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  It is hard to believe nothing at all can be so exciting.\\"  Every song is a lyrical masterpiece from beginning to end, but the vocal inflections must be heard to get the full meaning.  The music drives home these messages with compelling sounds that are textured to weave their way into your brain.  Just when you think you have everything figured out on comes, \\"Life During Wartime\\".  The truly gruesome subject of war is delivered without any of the horror reserved for the other pleasantries.  Instead we get a casual analysis.  It is just as effective at making its point.  Another brilliant iconoclastic twist that succeeds brilliantly.  As for the opener and closer.  Interesting.  FearOf Music is the most entertaining expression of a brilliant message that has been made by anyone on this planet in my lifetime.  A joy to listen to.  A joyful experience in every sense.
1401322336|1.0|This was such a disappointment! I am an experienced cook, but it's always nice to try something new and I have enjoyed \\"The Naked Chef\\"but after trying four recipes, I'm putting this away, I won't even give it away.
0385340540|4.0|After slogging my way through half of \\"The Appeal\\" before putting it down I thought that I would not read another new John Grisham novel ever again. However, I was pleasantly surprised by \\"The Broker\\". I enjoyed the story and the reader on the CD was very good. It wasn't quite the return to his glory days of The Firm and The Testament but nevertheless is was a good read. Maybe there's hope for him yet.

I realized that I did not want to go on another photo trip without replacing this valuable lens. A great all-purpose lens for wildflowers or panoramics.
1592402690|5.0|This is the only book I've ever read about the Beatles that gives much insight into their personalities as musicians. No psychoanalysis. No posing. It just seems real.    I would have liked more details about the recording process, but even with that I think this is perhaps the best book about them I've ever read.
0061537934|5.0|I was unsure about whether I would enjoy this book because I detest racing, but that is a peripheral theme in this amazing novel.  What makes this book shine is its unique narration, from the perspective of a dog, Enzo.  As Enzo perceives his life with Denny, his family and their struggles, Enzo also offers humorous commentary on a dog's life: lack of opposable thumbs, inability to communicate with speech, his envy of human capacities and his hope to be reincarnated as man.  Enzo's relationship with Denny is the heart of this book, and Enzo's perception of Denny's tribulations is a portrait of honesty and loyalty.  As for the racing aspect, it is more used in metaphorical statements about control and life, so I did not feel for a moment that it detracted from my enjoyment of this incredibly well written story.  Highly recommended!

0812580346|4.0|I had an incredibly eerie experience reading this book.  I ordered it from Amazon on April 21, 2009 and started reading it on April 24.  The events recounted in this novel begin on April 21, 2009, something that I did not know when I ordered the book.  Although the novel was published in 1999, it takes a stab at depicting events that largely took place this past week.  I'm pretty certain that I've never had this experience with a book before, reading a book during which the actual timeline is supposed to occur.<br /><br />I decided to read this upon reading unconfirmed rumors that FOX is likely to green light a new series based upon this novel starting in the fall of 2009.  Given that FOX is apparently considering canceling my two favorite series on FOX -- DOLLHOUSE and TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, I am leery of watching any new series on FOX.  I'm simply tired of giving shows on FOX a chance, only to have them cancelled.  (The third show that I watch on FOX is FRINGE, which does appear headed for renewal.  But despite occasional flashes of excellence it has been oddly sluggish for most of its run, though its \\"mythology\\" holds promise of very good things to come.)  The series is set to star Joseph Fiennes, though his role (of an FBI agent) is not a character in the novel.  In fact, apart from the central event of people getting future glimpses of their lives, the series seems to have little to do with this novel.  So, this novel is only very loosely the source for the forthcoming series.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  I have little familiarity with the physics that lies at the heart of the book and I'm usually lost when those bits arise.  But the rest of the book was wonderfully executed.  The story involves an experiment conducted at the CERN supercollider in Switzerland that causes everyone on earth to have their consciousness thrown 21 years into the future, providing them with a glimpse of their future lives.  The rest of the book deals with the fallout from this, including one physicist who investigates his own future murder.  The book's main character struggles with his own conviction that the events of the future are indelible and inevitable and cannot be changed.<br /><br />If I had a problem with the book, it was with the final section in the book.  I enjoyed an action sequence that occurs there, but much else I felt was not organically connected with the rest of the book.  I don't want to give details about what happens there, but I feel that it doesn't flow naturally from the rest.  Also, there is a very strange contradiction.  On the one hand Sawyer has his protagonist take the position (based on visions of the future) that artificial intelligence leading to consciousness is impossible, while simultaneously envisioning a degree of technical development that would more or less make possible immortality along the lines fantasized by Ray Kurzweil and other techno nut jobs.  Achieving some sort of physical immortality seems to me to be the far more challenging technical task.  Sawyer doesn't specify precisely how we are to achieve this kind of immortality (e.g., some of the techno nut jobs believe that it will be possible to take minute slices of the brain and transfer their contents to a computer database), so at this point he essentially dodges one of the most challenging questions.  Still, while I found this part of the book really silly, the rest was a heck of a lot of fun.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this novel for lovers of Sci-fi, but I'm guessing that it will be of only minor interest to those who plan on watching the upcoming FOX series.m this, including one physicist who investigates his own future murder.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|Welcome to the world of Pinocchio, the story of a marionette who is given life and wishes to become a real boy some day.  The animation here is simple, but already more defined than that of Snow White (and only the second full length Disney feature).  This is a beautiful, beautiful film - both visually as well as in the storytelling (and I don't say that about every Disney flick).  You know the movie.  You'd want it anyway, but this is the Platinum Edition.<br /><br />So, what's up with the Platinum Edition?  Two features, really.  First, the Leonard Maltin commentary track.  That's always a positive.  The real feature to get excited about, though, is the hour long Making of Pinocchio feature.  Outstanding mini-documentary, that one.  Seriously.<br /><br />Also included are some deleted scenes, an extra song, and games for the kiddies.  The adults will want this for the beautiful transfer, the commentary track, and the Making Of.<br /><br />This is the way to watch Pinocchio.  Along with Sleeping Beauty, this is a classic Disney film that should be owned.

B0015I2P0Y|1.0|When John and Jane Doe drive home from work, John and Jane need music. Like their cars, clothes and even the neighborhood they live in, John and Jane like their music safe. That's why they like muzak. Music at home both in the elevator, doctor's waiting room or even for 'lil Johnny's tenth birthday party.    Buy this music/muzak and let it be the soundtrack to your McWorld. There are some great McHits and even some McBlues tracks with McSoulfull singing. The fast food of music. Or the music of fast food?...     Let it shroud your soul in shrink wrap. Play it first thing as you rise out of bed. Sing to it as you shower and even as you cover yourself head to toe with brand-name clothing. If Coldplay is too artsy and heavy and you need something with that down home, old-school, backwoods, cheesy British white guy blues, just like down in Memphis except without the bluesiness or soul, then this is for you.     Just like Britney Spears is exactly like Aretha Franklin except without the music or voice or anything. The world needs another Coldplay like my neighborhood needs another Starbucks...    Listen safely.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|i love the introduction...she looks like a goddess. i really believe that she's on her way to become a legend in the likes of mariah, madonna, and janet. i love alll the costumes on this tour. i love her curly hair too! at times, she looked like j.lo. they're sexy, flirty, glamorous. i especially love the one where she wears the gold top and gold bottoms. when she sings flaws and all, she always get teary eyed during that performance. when i saw the tears rolling down her face, she looked so gorgeous and angelic. the picture quality of dvd was very excellent and clear. it's like you were actually there. this concert has girl power written all over it. and i love it how she pays tribute to my jamaican roots. you go, beyonce! all of her band consists of females and they sure can rock!!! the part where they had those male dancers stripping or whatever had left me blushing. and for those who think christina milian is prettier than beyonce..this dvd will prove u wrong!!!! beyonce got the moves, style, attitude, grace, and unforgettable hits. she can't be compared!!!! and i look forward to see her i am...tour whenever it comes out on dvd. Beyonce is the best!!!!

B00180R06I|5.0|This is a rare horror film that doesn't bludgeon you, but unsettles you.  I like what Dreyer said about the effect he was trying to achieve....<br /><br />\\"Imagine we are sitting in an ordinary room. Suddenly we are told that there is a corpse behind the door. In an instant, the room we are sitting in is completely altered: everything in it has taken on another level; the light, the atmosphere have changed, though they are physically the same. This is because we have changed... This is the effect I want to achieve in Vampyr.\\".<br /><br />Dreyer achieves this effect masterly.  The film is an eerie dream.  There really is no logic to it.  It is comprised of ethereal, many unexplained images, and the look of the film is unique and special.  The look was achieved when on the first day of shooting.  The cameraman and Dreyer were looking at the footage, and they discovered a light leak in the camera.  This brought great distraught to the cameraman, but Dreyer liked the look of the footage, so they shot the rest of the film that way.  There is little dialogue, mostly muffled sounds, which makes the film even stranger and more unsettling.  The most famous shot is the best one in the film.  It's when the Baron (played by Julian West) dreams that he is dead, and we see a funeral from his point of view in a coffin.  It's one of the weirdest, most unforgettable scenes ever in a horror film, and even to this day it's still remarkable.<br /><br />Dreyer was primarily known as a spiritual director, directing such films as Passion of Joan of Arc, Day of Wrath, and his best film, Ordet.  Directing a horror film was unusual for him, but he was such a great artist that he could pull it off.  Unfortunately, Vampyr bombed at the box office, and Dreyer didn't direct again until 11 years later.  Regardless of its box office performance, Vampyr is still a startling film, one that really is scary and incredibly memorable.
B001EO748M|5.0|This show is loads of fun to watch.  The charcters and scenarios are actually portrayed accurately, for a change.  The costumes are wonderful and the actors are just the right degree of sexy (especially that gorgeous Henry Cavill).  It's so great to be able to buy DVDs of the series, because I don't have time to watch it on HBO.
B000057DON|5.0|This record can now be considered a classic and every rock fan should have it.<br />The overall quality of the product is great and the sound is perfect.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|What was he thinking?  This CD stinks.  If you're a Soundgarden, AudioSlave, Cornell fan, don't buy it.  There's not one song that I could listen to all the way through.
