0451457994|4.0|Usually seeing the movie helps you dope out the book. Here it's the other way around.<br /><br />Published in 1968, the same year as the movie of the same name co-written with director Stanley Kubrick, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" is Arthur C. Clarke's fictionalization of how man might at last begin unraveling the mystery of his origin - and his purpose.<br /><br />Not being a fan of the movie, which I found opaque and drawn out, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself entertained with the novel, and following along much more easily. Clarke's clean, antiseptic prose style is not dissimilar to the design of Kubrick's film, but Clarke takes time to pause and explain things, and his love of astronomy and astrophysics is communicated in a fluid, digestible way.<br /><br />The novel is built like the movie: There's a short introductory section in which some pre-human primates discover the value of tools millions of years ago with the help of a mysterious monolith from nowhere. Then we come to a lengthier section set on the Moon, circa 1999, where the discovery of another monolith beneath the friable lunar surface sets the main plot in motion. The third and last section features David Bowman, chief astronaut aboard the spaceship \\"Discovery\\", who two years later is sent to Saturn for reasons that have something to do with the moon monolith.<br /><br />Yes, Saturn, not Jupiter, which was the destination in the movie. There are other differences, both major and subtle. Most notable to me was the focus of the novel on the intricacies of the \\"Discovery\\" journey. We get details on the spaceship's inspection of an asteroid as well as Jupiter (here used as an astronomical perturbation to slingshot the craft to Saturn more quickly). The point of the monoliths are explained in much detail; like how they operate on the primates as a kind of evolutionary jump start. Clarke's crafty brilliance even offers up an explanation for Saturn's rings that is quite a jolt for how it ties in neatly with his fictional construct.<br /><br />You get more of a read on the lifestyle of this imagined then-future, now-past. Kubrick used the question of a bathroom in space for a throwaway joke, but Clarke gets into this matter in more detail. He also provides some bits of levity. When Bowman's fellow voyager Frank Poole reports on a conversation he just had with Mission Control, he notes they said \\"there was no cause for alarm. They said that twice, which rather spoiled the effect as far as I was concerned.\\"<br /><br />Mostly it's a dry read, however. Not only are Bowman and Poole fairly dull for the most part, they aren't at risk here of being upstaged by their computer companion HAL 9000 the way they were in the movie. HAL has his breakdown in the novel just like the film, but there's no suspense around it here, nor the odd notes of sympathy you feel for the strangely human machine in Kubrick's film. Clarke does offer an explanation for HAL's misbehavior, but for me it was the least effective part of my read. Kubrick's instinct to say less on the matter makes the enigma of artificial intelligence more beguiling.<br /><br />The ending of the book likewise gives more detail than the movie did, but here I found the journey more rewarding, if still perplexing. Clarke's ambition to offer a persuasive construct as to \\"what-it-all-means\\" commands respect if not always agreement.<br /><br />It's impossible to agree on everyone on everything where the origin of cosmos is concerned. But I find myself in agreement with the majority view here more than I am with the overrated movie. Clarke's \\"2001\\" is a darn fine read, worth your time whether you are a sci-fi fan or just ever wonder about the big Why once in a while.You get more of a read on the lifestyle of this imagined then-future, now-past.

0802130208|4.0|'A Confederacy of Dunces' is certainly one incredible book.  Often described as a comic masterpiece, it chronicles the foibles of one absurd young man in New Orleans during the early 1960s.  Often farcical and hysterical, the book seems to capture the essence of New Orleans.  All the characters are equally endearing and tragic.  Yes, this book is worthy of all the praise heaped upon it.  However I will be a humbug and say that after awhile much of the antics got to be a bit repetitious and too slapstick for my taste.  And the ending, while certainly not bad, did not measure up to the fine qualities of the rest of the book.      Bottom line: New Orleans as it was, and probably still is.  A book that will get you smiling.
055358894X|5.0|I received this book from a friend when looking for something new to read. I had never heard of Scott Lynch or the series before. So I had no preconceived notions of what to expect. So I sat down and started to read.     I could not put that book down! It was a great ride. Ups and downs throughout. The attention to detail was just perfect. You could really get a good sense of the surroundings these characters played in. There were twists and turns not easily figured out. (I hate being able to figure out what is going on before the answer shows up in the book!)     I do hope Lynch opens up a little more in the next few books. I am really looking forward to the rest of the series.

1400049628|5.0|The author has a very strong tone, stating zombie facts as if they were real, or are they?!    ·         The book sometimes reads like a Mad Magazine, but there are some portions of the book that are fact based and you do not need an undead foe to use some of the survival tips. For example, when you get word of some calamity about to occur, fill your bathtubs with water just in case water pipes break. Eat your perishables first, and leave food items in cans last because these have a longer shelf life.    ·         Includes true accounts of zombie attacks!    ·         I'm contemplating on reading World War Z next. Hopefully they will make a movie out of Max Brooks' book series.

B002ZG994U|4.0|THE A-TEAM succeeded as a television series by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell because it knew how to mix gore and comedy.  The same is true for the movie version written by Director Joe Carnahan with Brian Bloom and Skip Woods - dipping in to the original series a bit.  It is a fast moving kicker of an evening's entertainment, not a challenge to the brain but fun all the same.<br /><br />This A-Team has been out of action for a while but regroup to do the impossible - enter Bagdad and capture the counterfeit plates for 100-dollar bills before the 'enemy' makes a mint of fake money.  From the get-go this bizarre group of Special Forces soldiers seem to make things up as they go - the 'plan' being the ideal process but one that basically eludes them - or does it?  This particular cinematic A-Team is composed of the leader Col. Hannibal Smith (a gray haired but fast thinking Liam Neeson), the lady-killer stud Face (a very buff Bradley Cooper), hard-nosed mohawked Baracus (Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson) and the ever so loony Murdock (the new and very promising Sharlto Copley).  Put these guys in helicopters, in tanks, in every imaginable disastrous situation and they manage to come out just fine and making hilarious jokes of the whole thing. Part of the pleasure of this otherwise forgettable film is the obvious fun the cast members are having.  The special effects are better than usual, the supporting cast boasts such actors as Jessica Biel, Gerald McRaney, Patrick Wilson, Yul Vazquez, Henry Czerny, and Jon Hamm - some in roles that pass so fast that they almost go unnoticed.  Alan Silvestri provides the musical score that is as entertaining on its own as the film itself and the Director of Photography Mauro Fiore is the one that give us the impossible effects a near tenable reality.<br /><br />This is a film to rent or buy for an evening of escapism.  It is action packed and hilariously funny!  Grady Harp, December 10
B00004XQ83|4.0|The songs, the harmonies, the lyrics, are really entertaining and generate a nice sound. I'm not a big bluegrass guy but I really enjoyed the movie so decided to buy the album.  I have been enjoying it ever since.
B00192IV9U|5.0|The Album is PERFECTION!! Honestly, one of his best ever! If it is even possible!!    For fans who are still confused about the album, give it a listen before you judge. Simply, Buy it. You will be surprised. It's Michael's voice all the way!!    Watch Oprah's interview with the Cascios and study their faces/reactions/and most... importantly their WORDS. And ask yourself: do these people look/sound like \\"a family after money\\"??    The album is great. Those, who refuse to even listen to the album, are missing out biggg time. It is amazing!!     By not supporting the album, you are siding with some of his family members, namely Tito's sons. They created this fuss to attract attention. And because THEIR submitted songs were not accepted on the album. So they went and created this craziness to smear the Cascios. Michael was not close to Tito's sons in the last years. But he choose to stay at the Cascios' house,for 4 months, when he came to the US after the trial. That should tell you a lot about the whole situation.
B001VNB54A|2.0|Firstly, the comparison with Band of Brothers cannot be overlooked. If you've never watched the before mentioned TV series, I'm sure your appreciation of lack thereof of the Pacific may be widely different. Band set a tone for the modern Docu-action series based on WWII, and I'm sure this show will not be the last show compared dis-favorably against it.    When first watching the show, I was astounded at the lack of humanity that was just brimming out of band of brothers. The characters are unlikable and generally forgettable. The story moves in a few notable tones. One is the Warriors in the muck. I'm sure the pacific was a hell on earth, but depicting hours of masochism isn't why I watch TV, and unfortunately this show was packed full of it. I was really hoping for a show more along the lines of the movies depicted from the period which is mostly of the sea and air battles. The show all but glances over them as well as pearl harbor or the ultimate capture of Japan.    The show stands as a story of the middle war waged from island to island between the US and Japanese forces, and if countless lopsided battles, trench-style warfare, over-baked emphasis on characters who aren't likeable and contrived dramatics are your thing, then jump in. Otherwise save the pennies and look for more Hollywood takes on the period instead (*shudder* never thought I'd ever way that).
B00005BJ2O|1.0|Most of the music on the soundtrack must be music used during the credits or opening or something - it was not the more popular music within the movie itself, which is what I was hoping for.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|Firstly, just to get it over with, the visuals and audio were just fine in the show. The overly CG feel to the whole show was mostly quite appealing and a lot of work was put into making the movie look good.    Unfortunately, a movie also requires a story and that is where this heaping pile of nonsense falls apart. If you have never played the video game from which this movie was named then just stop reading here. The movie will never make sense to you and you'll walk away asking yourself how so many people game this movie a good rating. I played the game over again maybe 2-3 years before watching the movie and even I was lost half the time. The narrative and direction of the movie make you know the exactly what happened in the game to make the movie have any relevance. Ok, so lets say you loved the game. The movie lacks any kind of emotional or dramatic depth that even action movies are almost always required to have.    The characters were yet another horrible part of the show. You had 2-3 of the original characters that had any sort of meaningful purpose through the story. The rest were thrown in because hey, we have to bring in the whole game's cast don't we??? No, you don't. You've yet again fallen into bad storytelling by throwing in way way too many characters that have little if anything to do with the narrative. Take away 1/2 to 3/4 of the cast and re-focus the plot to the ghosts of Cloud's past and a modern experiment going awry is great. Don't drag the whole 100 hour game's plot an motivations into a 2 hour story and then try to tack on a new plot.    It really deserves a 2, but the skew between ratings and reality are way too far apart, so every little bit to bring it down is needed.
0451196716|5.0|I am a casual SK fan, having read the more obvious stuff (\\"The Shining,\\" \\"Different Seasons,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" etc.) and enjoyed it, but I am far from one of his more rabid devotees.  \\"The Long Walk\\" may be the book that changes all that.    Sometimes the most terrifying idea can be witnessing what somebody else considers to be normal.  \\"TLW\\" works as a horror novel just for that reason.  100 teenage boys across the nation volunteer to participate in the Long Walk, a race that starts in Maine but has no formal finish line.  In the early pages, it all seems like a lark . . . except for some of King's patented ominous foreshadowing.  The boys hang out, size each other up, establish some cliques and a heirarcy, and then they are off.    The rules of the Long Walk are simple.  Maintain a pace of four miles per hour.  If you fall below the pace for about 30 seconds, you get a warning - no exceptions.  No medical emergencies.  No time outs.  No rest areas.  You can erase a warning by walking at pace for an hour.  After your third warning, \\"they punch your ticket.\\"    That ominous phrase has the most dire meaning imaginable.  Under the rules of the game, 99 tickets must be punched.  The last Walker wins his heart's desire for the rest of his life.  Each of the other Walkers gets a hail of bullets - there is no reprieve for being the runner-up.    And this is normal.  The Walk is as popular as the Super Bowl or the World Cup, and the rabid, adoring crowd is terrifyingly indifferent to the horror of the Walk.    King gets into the minds of several of the Walkers, but the protagonist of the story is Ray Garraty, a Walker from Maine who is pretty much an Everyman character.  Through Ray's eyes, we see his fellow Walkers gradually have their tickets punched.  As the race goes on, we see the Walkers waste away as the miles eat away at their shoes, their clothes, their bodies, their hearts and their minds.  Each Walker has to decide how much of this torture he is going to take, and how he is going to take it.  Do you choose to have your ticket punched?  Do you push on until you collapse?  Do you go down swinging?    Written in King's spare prose, \\"TLW\\" is one of those books that sends chills down your spine even though you're sitting in a comfy chair in front of the fire.  The fate of the Walkers will stay with you long after you've read the last page, and you will ask yourself if you would as well (or as deplorably) as the Walkers do.  That's a good book.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|I saw TRON Legacy in IMAX 3D, and I was impressed at times but it never really came close to meeting my expectations.  To begin with, the first half-hour or so (set in \\"the real world\\") is relatively humdrum and not unique: a flashback scene to the hero's youth (in which the younger/ CGI Jeff Bridges has problems with realistic lip movements while talking), a bit of industrial espionage the likes of which we've seen many times before, and a setup scene for Sam (the son) to enter The Grid.  Once he's into the Grid, the part of the movie we've come to see actually begins.<br /><br />As Sam searches for his dad and battles the Big Bad Guy (CLU), we get the light-cycle race, one of two pretty cool scenes in the movie.  (The other is the \\"dogfight\\" scene, late in the film.)  This is where the 3D could have been used more effectively and to a greater extent, but it wasn't.  You know how you're amazed in 3D movies with stuff that pops out in front of you? Feeling like you could almost reach out and touch them?  Well, that doesn't happen very often in TRON Legacy.  Perhaps the moviemakers were aiming for a more integrated use of 3D, so it appears natural and is hardly noticed.  If so, that seems to go against the entire concept of 3D movies.  The limited use of 3D was the biggest problem for me.<br /><br />But there were so many more flaws, including (1) Even though the light-cycle and dogfight scenes were cool, the moments when one rider/ pilot defeated one of their enemies happened too quickly to really see how or why the enemy was defeated.  One second the two were coming together, the next, one of them was dissolving into pieces (bytes?), with little clue on what actually caused the destruction. That confusion could've been solved by a slo-mo cutaway or other ways. (2) The sound was often too LOUD (no surprise), especially the music in some scenes.  A related sound problem is that dialog was often hard to make out, either due to an echo chamber effect or an excess of background noise.  (3) The story was poorly constructed at times, such as how Zeus was initially supposed to be a good guy, but he never really seemed for a moment like he was actually going to help the heroes (and many other similar things).<br /><br />There are various great looking visuals in The Grid portion of the flick, such as when the \\"cargo ship\\" flies across the beam toward the Portal.  So TRON Legacy wasn't a completely worthless movie.  The sad thing is that, as usual, so many viewers will quickly and easily overlook the many problems just because a few scenes are cool.  That's just the way things are with filmgoing these days.ise.

B003NFM3JK|3.0|The animation is great no doubt about that. The story is faithful to the novel no complaint there. Boy it was much more scary. The scene with Jacob Marley's ghost is so graphic with his mouth cracking open and this horrid black tongue hanging out. I am an adult and it was to scary and it was gross. I had to look away. To top it off I did fall asleep that never happens in the Polar Express. So I have mixed emotions.<br /><br />Also when you get a DVD they usually have the picture of the cover on the DVD, no so this is the plain gray you get when you rent from a place like Netfix. Made it feel like I was getting a discount cut down copy. Not that it totally matters but with all things considered it was one more disappointment.<br /><br />The best part is the bonus material on how it was made and the reactions of the actors. I wanted this to be a 5 star but it just is not and I sure wouldn't show it to children under 10 years old. This is the stuff of nightmares.

Annie's voice is as powerful and clear as ever, but I think she should have dialed it back on some the songs. I actually like the authoritative sound in 'The Holly and the Ivy' and even 'the First Noel' but it starts to sound downright angry after a while. She also plays some of the instruments (there aren't many), so it could be she is just trying a bit too hard on the whole thing.
0061730335|4.0|William Kamkwamba seemed to have nothing going for him. Growing up in a small village in Malawi (Africa), he was raised in extreme poverty, had little access to education, and stood face-to-face with starvation for months at a time in the midst of drought. With his dysfunctional government showing no real support, William took matters into his own hands and, using nothing but a bit of self-taught knowledge of electricity, imagination, an assortment of scrap-heap parts, and the persistence and desire to inject a positive charge into a world full of negatives, built a windmill that brought hope to entire community.     As an educator, this book served as a refreshing reminder that all children, no matter the circumstances, have the ability to achieve something. Too often, we make assumptions or set limits for certain students like William, perhaps because their socioeconomic status is too low, their educational background is a track record filled with mediocrity, or the problems they face just seem to be too big for them to overcome. Even though he is told to stop wasting his time and give up, William proves to us all that a little imagination and enthusiasm can go a long way.

I think reading about the author and how and why he created and was able to perfect the pictures makes the book even more interesting.  The information is on the author's website, not with the book, which is unfortunate.  The book is a great conversation piece for children, grown-ups, and Star Ward fans.

0307473473|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo / 978-0-307-47347-9<br /><br />I saw the movie of this novel first, and really enjoyed it, but when I started the novel, I nearly didn't make it past the first few chapters. I'll be honest: I've yet to read a 400+ page book that I didn't think could use a firmer editor, and this book did nothing to change my opinion. The writing is heavy and circuitous - finance discussions are interrupted with primers on what `journalism speak' is and isn't; a main character is introduced via a chapter that tells us her *employer's* name, rank, serial number, and favorite breakfast foods; and I had to laugh out loud when an in-depth study of the Vanger family is preempted with an entire page-full regaling the computer program the journalist favors to organize his notes, where it can be downloaded, and who the developers are, and how the developers are just generally awesome people.<br /><br />After my first aborted attempt at immersion, however, I came back and persevered through the opening slog, and I'm glad I did. The book is just as immersive as the movie, and it's impossible to not get caught up in the mystery of the Vanger family, and their dark and secretive past. The main characters are sympathetic and compelling, and if they occasionally smell a little like Mary-and-Marty Sue (what with Blomkvist being such a country-wide celebrity and quite the ladies' man, and with Salander being eight levels of concentrated awesome at all times), it's okay because the story around them is so compelling that we can forgive the characters for being a touch larger than life.<br /><br />Although \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" is good stand-alone fiction, I'm particularly impressed by the underlying themes explored here in terms of violence against women and the exploitation of the vulnerable members of society. From the statistics presented at the beginning of the chapters to the careful exploration of the exploitation of main character Salander through the guardian system, the author presents a clear and compelling view of the ways the most vulnerable members of society can be exploited and hurt in silence. And while sometimes the message is a little worryingly heavy-handed (Blomkvist is openly applauded for being the first man to treat Salander like a human being, which seems a bit much and a tad unlikely), the overall message is both important and compellingly-written.<br /><br />I even eventually warmed to the writing style, and though I do stay by my belief that stricter editing would only have improved this excellent book, I came to love it anyway, and I'm glad I stuck with it. I will definitely be reading the next book in the series, and I encourage anyone who liked the movie to stick with the book and give it a chance to win you over.<br /><br />A word about the audiobook for this novel: This is some of the best book narration I've had the pleasure of listening to. The pacing and pausing is spot-on, and the character voices are unique, distinct, and full of feeling without being gimmicky or distracting. Although I usually feel audiobooks are \\"slow\\" compared to reading the novel (since one can read faster than the audiobook can speak), this audiobook feels perfectly paced, and the meandering writing style of the book seems to fit better here than on the page. I definitely recommend this audiobook to anyone, but especially to anyone who perhaps couldn't complete the reading but still wanted to complete this fantastic novel.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardolluthor presents a clear and compelling view of the ways the most vulnerable members of society can be exploited and hurt in silence.

0060987464|5.0|This book is definatly a spotlight Of how even though a rockstar can have so much money and be loved by all sometimes you dont know how to love yourself and others .Also it shows that he had a really messed up childhood that would make some people afraid and may even have nightmares of what they were seeing or hearing about .
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I missed Genesis during their heyday in the early '70s, though I caught every Yes concert in NYC during that time.  A few months ago I heard \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" on Pandora and remembered hearing it on FM radio back in the days.  I downloaded Foxtrot from iTunes and loved it, especially \\"Supper's Ready.\\"  After watching dozens of YouTube videos, I decided to get to know Genesis in a more meaningful way.  Thus I ordered the Genesis 1970-1975 boxed set from Amazon.  The set consists of 5 CDs (their actual 1st CD was not included due to contractual problems), and include the Peter Gabriel years.  Each also comes as a DVD with either Dolby or DTS mix (latter is preferred).  The DVDs contain interviews with the band as individuals from 2007 which are fascinating.  There are full length concert videos as well, and though the sound quality is imperfect, give a great idea of what their stage show was.  The CDs are remastered and, though I don't have the originals for comparison, sound quite good.  It is clear the band needed Phil Collins and Steve Hackett for musical depth and variety, and the last 4 of this set feature this lineup. Each album is superb, and it is interesting to hear the progression in songwriting and musical technique.    There is no doubt Genesis was one of the premier progressive rock bands and this boxed set is a great way to rediscover them.

B00433TO52|3.0|Does this kick butt or what? It's not as packed as some of those coffee table books with historical trivia, commentary and criticism but ... it's pretty awesome.<br /><br />Bravo! This eBook has a cover! My excitement was short-lived, however ... the entire book is horribly, horribly formatted - the \\"easy\\" table of contents in particular: EVERYTHING IS IN ALL CAPS MAKING IT ANYTHING BUT EASY TO READ. Not only that, but there are instructions before the TOC stating, \\"click on a title to jump to that work.\\" First of all, you don't click on any e-book reader. Second, if you had the desire and necessary skill to purchase, download and open an e-book and reader, you likely know what a hyperlink is for.<br /><br />I love that \\"easy to use table of contents\\" is part of the title. Not only does it come with the rare, hard-to-get apocryphal plays and the \\"easy to use table of contents\\" but ... you get - for FREE - \\"special bonuses\\"! I'm not quite sure what, exactly, is Newly Enhanced that increases the \\"reading pleasure\\" but it must be good because they even capitalized it!<br /><br />Having said all that, Shakespeare In Your Pocket is a wonderful collection at the bargain price of $1.99
0316010669|5.0|Awesome book!!  Have read The Tipping Point and the Outliers by Malcolm McDowell as well and they are all excellent.  He writes in a way that holds you from page one and reads like a fascinating novel.  Blink is my favorite as it is amazing food for thought, insightful and makes you look at things in a whole different way. I've recommended this book to many people.
0743246616|1.0|Bought this book after returning from NY & having had the cupcakes and the Chocolate cake.  I followed the recipe letter for letter and the chocolate cupcakes and the vanilla buttercream icing   would have been better from a Duncan Hines box. Very DISAPPOINTED!!

006621131X|5.0|Just finished \\"Just Kids\\", Patti Smith's National Book Award Winning memoir of her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. The book reveals the tender innocent hearts both artists carried beneath raw & provocative exteriors that were often misunderstood. A glimpse into the NYC of late 1960's to early 1970's, Ms. Smith was at the thick of the cultural crossroads of the time and describes vividly encounters with everyone from Salvador Dali to Jimi Hendrix. I followed my own path to NYC in 1976 and wished I had this \\"handbook on how to stay true to art\\" when I first arrived there to follow my own dreams. Every young artist should read this and don't look back. Just go for it!
B0040JHXTI|5.0|This is the most rewarding box set I have ever seen. As readers, we are given insight into the process of the lyric writing, song selection and album creation. As listeners, we discover the incredible depth and diversity of musicianship that went into the recording sessions. As viewers, we are taken back in time to a Darknesss-era concert as well as the documentary behind the album. Thanks to those who labored to produce such an amazing document. How will they top this with \\"The River\\" remaster?
B00005NVT1|4.0|I enjoy electronica music and had reviewed a Deadmau5 CD. Another Amazon reviewer, P. Harper, suggested: \\"Gary! Gotta go with Daft Punk!!\\" Well, Daft Punk had appeared on my recommended list several times so I gave them a try. I bought a double CD pack that featured two live Daft Punk concerts. I played them both one after the other with \\"Alive 2007\\" first and followed by \\"Alive 1997.\\" In retrospect, I don't think that was the best procedure. The \\"Alive 2007\\" disc is one of the best live concerts I've ever heard, no matter what the genre. Anything that followed it would have been a letdown. Well, the \\"Alive 1997\\" followed it and was, you got it, a letdown. The \\"2007\\" disc was a clearly superior disc in every way and I found the \\"1997\\" disc a disappointment.<br /><br />Well, later, I went back to the \\"1997\\" disc and I've changed my mind somewhat. It's quite a good disc. Very enjoyable. It just doesn't hold up to \\"2007\\" in a direct comparison, so I didn't listen to it in that way. Well, there's a decade difference between them and it shows. The \\"1997\\" disc sounds antiquated, but it's probably pretty futuristic for the time. The heavy beats and song composition and repetitions all strike me as interesting, but somewhat old fashioned. The sound is good, but nowhere nearly as good as that of the \\"2007\\" disc. What gives? I had originally thought of the recording equipment, and that may be the case, but after listening again and again, the difference just might be the auditorium acoustics.<br /><br />In any case, both of these albums are excellent. My advice might be, if you only want one, then go with the \\"2007\\" CD. If you like to have everything from such a fine group as Daft Punk, the \\"1997\\" CD is quite worthwhile. Some people might even prefer it. Who knows? I'd further suggest that if you want the \\"1997\\" disc, buy it in the double album pack. You'll save a lot.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B002ZG981E|5.0|I'll start it off by saying im not a fan of any of the actors or actress's. However i was told it was a good movie by all my friends that saw it, so i maned up and watched it. It was a far better movie than expected, the acting wasnt to bad either, well it was pretty good coming from people i dont like like i said before.    I dont know if i missed something in the movie but it was pretty easy to follow. I could be crazy but it was kind of fun and a great idea for a movie. WIth showing faith in my friends and trying to build my blu-ray collection. I bought the 3-disc set with no regrets. I wish i could find out which one is the digital copy. I know it sounds dumb but every other movie i've gotten it has a seperate disc, says digital copy or says it along with movie or what not. I havent watched any of the features on the disc's but im willing to give these hated actors of mine a chance and watch them too.    I would buy it again on blu-ray  I would reccomend to friends to buy or rent  I hope this helped you out  I have no regrets buying it and i dont think you would too. but not everyones' me. haha. thanks for reading
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This series is so funny that it left me wanting more than a mere 12 episodes.  John Cleese, Andrew Sachs, and the other cast members are spot-on as the wacky people who run the Fawlty Towers inn on the English Riviera.  Assorted guests, mix-ups, disasters, and miscommunications create hilarity in every show.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I'm so enjoying this series ~ I feel like I can<br />sit down whenever I want and be trasported back to<br />when the series was on TV and you just HAD to<br />watch to see what happens!
B003V5PPZG|4.0|I got hooked on Linkin Park about 5 or 6 years ago when I really started listening to music, and when I say hooked I mean hooked.  I would not only listen to Hybrid Theory and Meteora non-stop, but I would listen to any unreleased song I could find.  I was a die-hard fan.  So naturally when I heard that they were going to put out Minutes to Midnight, I would look high and low for any glimpses of what the new material would be like.  When the album finally dropped, I bought it, but was a bit let down.  I expected the Mike Shinoda's raps over the rock beat with Chaz shredding the chorus with sing-scream lyrics.  Instead, I got a few hard songs, and a bunch of soft ballad-esque songs.  But the ballads grew on me, and Minutes to Midnight became one of my favorite CD's.  So flash forward 3 years to the release of A Thousand Suns, I basically knew what to expect.  The soft songs took some getting used to, but in the end they became favorites.    1 - The Requiem - Leadoff song with an apocalyptic feel.  The distorted refrain from The Catalyst adds a chilling perspective to it.  Overall a good way to start the album off.    2 - The Radiance - More of a driving beat, with an excerpt from the speech from Mr. Opphenmeier talking about the atomic bomb and relating it to the Bhagavad Gita (a text I just finished for one of my college courses).  Not anything really special, just a filler    3 - Burning In The Skies - Really soft electro song with Mike singing the verses and Chester singing the chourus.  Beat is made up of electronic drum and a toned down electric guitar and piano.  Bridge of the song has some pick-up of the guitar to give it more of a driving beat    4 - Empty Spaces - Think Civil War.  Sounds pretty cool.    5 - When They Come for Me - This is one of those songs that will grow on you.  Has a bass drivin tribal drum beat with some synthetic guitar elements.  Mike kills the verses while Chester does an arab/indian imitation over the chourus that sounds really goodactually    6 - Robot Boy - Really basic song, probably my least favorite on the album until it grew on me.  Chester and Mike harmonize singing verses over a power ballad beat.  Vocals on this song are great.    7 - Journada Del Muerto - Instrumental leading to Waiting for the End.  Really expected something darker due to the title (Spanish for Journey of the Dead) but instead got something that is 80's synthesizer sounding.    8 - Waiting for the End - Really a feel good song.  One of my favorites on the whole album.  Mike drops 2 sick reggae style verses over a electrodrum and piano beat.  Chester comes in with a beautiful chourus, and the song is capped off with a fist-pumping head nodding (not banging) bridge and finish.  Really wish they would play the intro with actual guitars live, because it would sound sick.    9 - Blackout - The intro had a weird yet cool 80's feel to it.  Chester comes in with 2 scream/rap verses and finally lays waste to his vocal chourds on the chourus.  After the second chourus the 80's beat is replaced with a hard driving head-banging electro beat with the chourus being chopped and screwed and basically remixed by DJ Hahn.  The song changes once again to end with a soft singing verse by Mike over a beat almost identical to the intro.    10 - Wretches and Kings - Best song on the album.  Starts off with a speech by Mario Salvo, then launches into a head banging guitar beat.  Mike drops 2 dirty verses with Chester sing/screaming the chourus ala old Linkin Park, with DJ Hahn dropping a turn-table solo at the end.  Lyrics and beat make the song a staple for any pre-game playlist.    11 - Wisdom, Justice, and Love - Dr. Martin Luther King delivers a speech over a piano, and his vioce gradually changes to evil robot    12 - Iridescent - One of my favorites.  Starts off with a slow piano and deep lyrics, then gradually builds and builds into a full-fledged song with guitar, drums, lead vocals, and gang-vocals in the background.  Truly worthyour listen    13 - Fallout - Chourus from Burning in the Skies is repeated with distortion.  Leads up to The Catalyst    14 - The Catalyst - First single, and a really good song.  Starts with a fast paced electrodrum and turntable scratch beat with Mike and Chester trading vocals.  The song adds more and more layers until it breaks into the bridge, where it gets really good.  Bridge breaks into piano and drum beat with Mike repeating \\"Lift me up, Let me go.\\"  Then Chester belts out the same lyrics along with Mike, and the original beat is fused with the current one forming an epic finish.    15 - The Messenger - Not sure why everyone is down on this one.  I believe it's a very good song, and Chester belting out the lyrics over acoustic guitar makes it captivating.  Beautiful ballad with good lyrics to live by.
0312588887|4.0|Well! Well! I read this book during a difficult period of my life. I was starting to fall ill with my hereditary disease. I did not know what was happening to me then, I was just sick. Anyway, five years later, here I am writing this book review reminiscing about the dark period of my life. A lot has changed now and I am happy to say that I am relatively healthy.    \\"A Woman of Substance\\" is a novel that I read in my moments of despair. It is a thick novel to read when one is sick, but it is quite interesting. The writer, Barbara Taylor Bradford is able to depict the life of an entrepreneur, Emma Harte and the creation of her business empire.    Harte is the paragon of success in the Western world. She came from little beginnings to create a chain of stores that are well known. Notwithstanding, her love life is not that good. She falls in love with her boss' son Edwin Fairley and gets pregnant. Edwin refuses to marry Emma to her chagrin. Emma flees to the city to protect herself and her child from gossip.    Emma gets married, but her husband dies. She meets a young Australian soldier(Paul McGill) and falls in passionately in love with him. Paul also dies as well but he leaves her with his estate.     After Paul's death, Emma continues to raise her children. She becomes old and realizes that her own children are perfidious. Instead of giving her estate to her children, she gives it to her grandchildren. She also makes her favorite grandchild, Paula the head of her company.
B002Q7JYPC|3.0|It's been 28 years since the last Eagles album (The Long Run-1979). One reviewer has it bang on this should have been a single cd for sure. I have about 6 or 7 songs from this album. There are some good tunes but it has been said over and over again and its true for sure there just isnt enough heart and passion on this album and it also lacks a good amount of Rocking tracks. Yes i realize The Eagles are older and have mellowed out im sure but come on they are capable of so much better than this. There are too many ballads on this double album and yes a lot of the music is simply elevator music. Yes The vocals sound amazing the harmonies are great and no one seems to have lost their voice. However the harmonies are just one part of what make The Eagles great they also have written some great songs and i know they have the ability to still write great songs. The hit song from this album is How Long How Long isnt even an Eagles song it was a Jd Souther tune that he wrote and recorded in 1972 on his first solo album. The best song on the album is the 10 minute title track hands down. Center Of The Universe and Business As Usual are good as well along with a few others overall the album lacks a punch. Im aware some people would give this album a five star rating strictly because they are so happy The Eagles have finally released some new material. Dont let that cloud your judgement as to what the album actually sounds like. I have no problem with a few ballads here and there but this album is loaded with them. Joe Walsh and Timothy B Schmidt are under used as usuall. The album does contain way too many political songs written by mr. moneybags himself Don Henley. Now there is nothing wrong with 1 or 2 of those types of songs on an album but when that seems to be all you are singing about it loses it's impact. That is the reason why Celeine Dion and Micheal Bolton arent very good all they do is ballads it becomes very one dimensional and boring. I dont hate on this album as much as some people but im not blind like the five star reviewers either. It would have made for a good single cd but as a double cd it falls flat. There isnt enough guitar licks and it also lacks versatility in the songs themselves. Anyway check out the title track its awesome.s much as some people but im not blind like the five star reviewers either. It would have made for a good single cd but as a double cd it falls flat.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was great service, received before expected.  DVD was perfect and the movie was Wonderful.  Thank you for the great service...
B002ZG981E|5.0|I originally saw this film on a whim during opening weekend. We went and saw this in theaters and I was absolutely blown away.    A movie like this in Hollywood has been long overdue. So many movies are remakes, adaptations, or sequels. It was refreshing to watch an original movie. I was actually surprised by the quality of the acting too, especially by Leonardo Dicaprio. The movie is exciting, a mind-bender, and one of those movies you can watch closely again and again, and always be surprised by new things.    There is only one small thing that I am a little disappointed in. Special Features. We wanted to watch a \\"making-of\\" documentary or something like that, and none exists on the special features disc. It was kind of a downer. But as for the movie, in and of itself, it is absolutely brilliant. Best movie I've seen in theaters in years, and a must-own film.
1932907009|5.0|It's a screenwriting book, but it transcends screenwriting and helps fiction writers of any kind on their structure and pacing and plot. Probably the easiest to understand, most direct book on writing out there - period. An excellent buy.
B00319ECGU|5.0|Unless you have been on another planet, you know how great the Dirty Harry movies are.  I am not going to review the movies (they are all 5 star).  The picture clarity pops off the screen.  If you have been watching these off TV for the last few years, you will be pleasantly stunned by the quality of the picture.  A must for all fans of Harry Callahan.
030746363X|5.0|Got the book today, mid-morning, bit into it right away.  Its now eight hours later and I'm finished ingesting one of the best books I've read in a long time!  Over 500 pages, this book is loaded with tips, stories, and guidelines for living a longer, stronger, and most of all more enjoyable.    I originally started following Tim after receiving his 4 Hour Work Week book.  Having already outsourced a good portion of my life I bought into the same advice Tim was giving.  Since that time I periodically checked in on his excellent blog.  The posts are inspiring.     Just a couple of months ago I read one of his posts which spoke about cutting gluten out of my diet.  On a whim I became gluten free for 22 days.  This was not easy.  I'm a beer drinker and love foods which typically have gluten (breads, pizza, etc.).  But the difference I felt after making that one diet change was extraordinary.  It's a big part of the diet recommended in the book.  And for me it has worked incredibly.    Also about two months ago I started working out again at the gym.  But my workouts are usually only 20 minutes and have me doing about a half dozen exercises with only 1 set per.  Additionally I only go to the gym about every 5 to 6 days.  The crazy thing is I have been making gains every time I go to the gym.  For me its the perfect kind of workout.  Leaves me feeling great and I don't have to spend hours in the gym.  I owe all this to Tim.    The book is full of so many other valuable tips.  I ordered about 20 products with Amazon today!!   I guess the worse thing about this book is it will leave you wanting to try so many of his recommendations.  Tough on the pocket book but great on your health and overall well being :)  Highly recommended 5 stars for sure!  Great job!!!
B002X7FELS|2.0|Unless you're a huge fan of Palahniuk, stay away from this book. If you're just getting into him I highly recommend \\"Haunted\\" or \\"Fight Club\\" over this.
1400079179|1.0|This is a work that I wouldn't recommend to anyone with any historical knowledge.  There are so many problems with the story that it is distracting.  The idea of a sacred feminine, as a woman myself, is redundant.  I am disappointed in the need to build a myth that deifies women as a gender.  The idea of doing so is pointless, when it is the nature of human beings, based on the algorithms in the brain interacting with the environment that are the problem.  Nothing new here--just a jumble of myths and \\"entertainment\\" that bore the reader to no end.<br /><br />I think the standards that are needed to produce a best seller have dropped quite a bit.  Double Day did the world no favor with its inaccuracies.  As such every reader should ask for its money back.  People should sue them since they have made the claim everything is true.
1844256383|5.0|Haynes Books are not new to me, having bought them and used them in the past to work on my vehicles, so when I read that they had engaged Stephen Howard, a renowned sax repairman in England, to write an \\"everything you want and need to know about saxophones\\" book I was very curious, as Haynes books were all about cars and motorcycles in the past.  Turns out this is a truly great book for all sax players or musical instrument repair techs!  It is filled with lots of historical info that helps you understand the progressive changes in the saxophone over the years, almost all based on Stephen actually playing and/or working on the current and older saxes.  As one of those players that loves the \\"vintage\\" saxes (I own Conn \\"Artist\\" models - both Alto (1932) and tenor (1929)) so can totally relate and agree with Stephen's assessments about the changes over the years!<br /><br />Even though I don't intend to do any major overhauls myself, this book is an invaluable resource, filled with common-sense advice on care, repair, and playing of the saxophone.  The layout is modern and filled with great photos that help the reader fully grasp what Stephen is explaining.  If you are a sax player...from beginner to Pro...you need to get this book!!  Great reading and great resource!! This is NOT your father's Haynes automobile repair manual!!  ;-)
B002GHHHKQ|1.0|The product was probably OK, but its Regional Code was not suitable for Australia. So I had to send it back for a refund. Could Amazon please pay more attention to this problem in the future? Perhaps you could include a check box in DVD order forms.
B00192IV9U|4.0|I am playing this album with Windows Media Player.  Normally, when I play an album this way, a little icon with the album cover appears on the upper left, and each song is listed with title, genre, and composer, as well as duration.  What happens now?  Unknown album, unknown artist, unknown genre, unknown year ...  Why do they do this?  Do they want to add to the mountains of speculation that everything surrounding the king of pop was fake?  It's almost as if they're trying to feed the frenzied imaginations of the hoards of paranoid conspiracy theorists out there.<br /><br />Ok, beyond this trivia, I am finding the album enjoyable to listen to.  The sound of MJ's voice singing is clear and unmistakable.  The general impression is definitely very MJ-like.<br /><br />I have a sense that they are playing it a bit safe with the arrangements, that MJ always pushed boundaries and that there would have been a more variation and more surprises if MJ had lived to finish it.<br /><br />I totally disagree with will.i.am that unfinished works of deceased composers ought not to be released -- but the question of whether to \\"complete\\" those works or release them in fragmentary form remains.  Not having heard the fragments, I cannot say whether they would better have been left fragmentary, or whether the \\"complete\\" versions here are preferable.  I certainly get the impression that some of the tracks are sung in a tone that was intended to be home demo and not final performance, where he sounds more child-like and casual rather than concert like.<br /><br />On the whole, though, I think most MJ fans will want to have this album.<br /><br />--------------<br />Addenda:  This album is a lot easier to listen to than \\"Invincible.\\"  That album had several songs that I really have to force myself to listen to, because I know he was a genius and I think it's \\"good\\" for me to try to mentally unravel the many complex layers of sound that he created in his works.  \\"Michael\\" is more consistently melodic and and harmonious.
B0029XFNA8|1.0|I thought I was getting a color version because of the packaging, but it is Black and White. This Black and White DVD is hardly any better than the Black and White DVD version I own. I was totally bummed to have wasted my money on the Black and White. I've never been a fan of Black and White - COLOR IS BETTER!!!<br /><br />I of course love the movie -- always have - watch it at least 3 times every Christmas. Love all the characters and I almost believed there was a Santa Claus.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Are you in the mood for what they used to call \\"headphone music\\"?     Alan Parsons' engineering was largely responsible for the sound of Pink Floyd's 'Atom Heart Mother' and 'Dark Side of the Moon' - and it definitely shows on this collection of songs. This is the most Floydian music you'll hear outside of David Gilmour's solo CDs, and is a truly great sci-fi concept album. From beginning to end, this is my favorite Alan Parsons Project CD due to the consistent, high-quality songwriting and tasteful musicianship. The jazz-funk of \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\" and the pretty ballad \\"Don't Let it Show\\" are the two best-known songs here, but there are some excellent instrumentals, too. \\"I Robot,\\" for example is a good, largely sequencer-based track and \\"Genesis Ch1 V32\\" has one of the most powerful musical themes you'll find anywhere. I appreciate that Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson didn't try to tie the songs to an explicit narrative, because I find this allows the listener's imagination greater latitude in reflecting upon the various moods and vignettes contained here.     Essentially, this is progressive pop rather than the jam-based virtuosity of bands like Yes or Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. The songs are distinct and don't really blend together into suites, nor do we have extended Floydian guitar solos. That said, session guitarist Ian Bairnson contributes exceptionally memorable and musical fills and solos throughout the album.    The bonus tracks are mostly unnecessary. Perfectionists like Alan Parsons aren't going to leave a lot of good material behind in the editing room so what we have here are demos and rough mixes. If you really want to hear \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\" without its great guitar solo, this is the place for you. The sole exception is \\"The Naked Robot,\\" which has nothing to do with fembots but is instead am extended remixing of several of the instrumental tracks to form a single composition. This makes the music sound more like a soundtrack than it did before, and reminds me a bit of Vangelis.     I strongly recommend this CD as one of the very best British art-rock concept albums of the 1970s.
B00192IV9U|5.0|A fantastic album...and absolutally is Michael's voices...no more discussions...enjoy this awesome album and stop with the discussions about if is or isn't michael's voice...the full album is amazing...from beginning to the end...Hold My Hand is a truly anthem...wonderful song...Hollywood Tonight and Monster is so modern and so great...Keep Your Head Up...Another Day...Best Of Joy...Behind The Mask...Much Too Soon...beautiful beautiful songs...a magnific purchase for any Michael Jackson's fan !!!
B000003BDJ|5.0|I had never really heard much of The Stones until I got this at age 17 in 1992. Up until that point I was a fan of The Beatles, but after hearing the songs on this 2 disc set I haven't listened to The Beatles hardly ever again. After hearing these songs I have gone on to buy every Stones cd and have tracked down a lot of their unreleased bootleg stuff as well. This is a great starter set for someone wanting the Stones early hits, but as all best of sets they still leave out some great songs. If you get this you will still need to at least get \\"Beggars Banquet\\",  \\"Let It Bleed\\"  and \\"Sticky Fingers\\" to cover the 64'-71'- era. Possibly pick up the two disc set \\"More Hot Rocks\\". Some of the better unreleased songs from this era are \\"Blood Red Wine\\", \\"Andrew's Blues\\", \\"C---sucker Blues\\" and \\"Hillside Blues\\" to name a few and  can be found on Youtube.  A few other from this era that can be found on various albums are \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\", \\"I Don't Know Why\\",  and \\"Memo From Turner\\".

The book is simply a collection of short notes or essays.  It does not really teach you anything on how to take  good pictures.  As an example, refer to page #180 in Volume 1.  I do not see any point about the content on this page.  What the author is trying to say.  There are other wonderful books on digital photography are available which are better than this book.
0735619670|3.0|I think this is a good book for software programmers to read, expecially early in their careers or right at the beginnin.

I only gave it 3 stars because I think they need another more recent update as several of the references are a bit antiquited.
0061730335|5.0|This story follows William Kamkwamba through his life in Africa.  During his childhood, his village and much of Africa in general, experience a horrible drought and a poorly run government that resulted in a massive amount of deaths.  As the story outlines the struggles that William and his family go through as poor farmers, the story also gives you insight into the heart and mind of a young, determined child as he builds his own future out of nothing but the scraps he finds around his village.    William's unbridled imagination and enthusiasm teaches us many things about teaching.  It teaches us that no matter how far behind a child may be according to the standards of the school, they are still capable of great things, as long as they are inspired.   William also teaches us the importance of tapping into our student's interests and showing them the joy of discovery during the learning process.  Finally, William teaches us that with hard work anything is possible, which applies to both teachers and students. William Kamkwamba's amazing, life-long journey through learning is an inspiration to teachers and students alike, who may feel hopeless; this novel, The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, gives you hope.
0671449028|5.0|I received this book as a baby shower gift and started reading it to my 3 month old as part of our bedtime \\"winding down\\" ritual. I sometimes rotate in other books, but this one is by far my favorite and we read this one every single night now! My baby is now 6 months old and he gets a huge grin on his face on the last page \\"they rock... and rock... and rock.... to sleep\\". I read it in our rocker and I do big exaggerated rocks when we read that page, and sometimes add in a few extra \\"and rocks\\" just for fun. Your baby will love this book!
B0012GMZA4|3.0|I wish this album was the remastered original, not a remix. Some passages sound better, but there are a lot of missing pieces and parts that are just completely different. I don't like the way the guitar tracks were submerged, or replaced with alternate studio tracks altogether. The original mix has been released! Buy it instead.
B003Y7L5W8|4.0|i really liked this album and i agree with most of the positive comments that were written before me. i just wanted to point out that Paul H. doesn't sing lead on any of these tracks though. this is the first album Andy & Paul have made since getting back together. i was so looking forward to hearing Paul sing a few as well as i like both of them equally. it's sort of the same way i like hearing Martin Gore(DM) or Curt Smith(TFF), etc. sing on records. you know they are not the main singer in their bands, but just as good. this album is definitely listener friendly, especially if you're a big OMD fan like me. i just hope there's more Paul on the next one.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|The National's ,\\"The Boxer\\" #68, is my favorite album by this Ohio band, with songs like \\"Fake Empire\\", \\"Mistaken For Strangers\\", \\"Brainy\\", the orchestrated,piano combo of \\"Squalor Victoria\\", \\"Slow Show\\", \\"Start A War\\", \\"Guest Room\\" and \\"Gospel\\".  I find this a lot more accessible than their new work \\"High Violet\\".
B003NFM3JK|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the better versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" ever made. Normally, I'm not a fan of Jim Carey's, but as this illustrated character, he's not so bad. The animation is wonderful! It will be viewed as a tradition in my home now.
0439023513|2.0|WARNING: SPOILERS OF ENDING!!  ------    I liked the first book, The Hunger Games. I liked that there weren't that many characters around, so you got really close to them. It showed Katniss's determination to get through it all, with Peeta by her side. The danger of other contestants trying to kill her, and the growing bond between Peeta and Katniss. I really did like it. Even the slight humour was a nice touch.    The second book, I gave it three stars. Katniss was reduced to a whiny girl who couldn't make up her mind to be with either Peeta or Gale, and the rest was just all blah. I figured, it's just the middle book, the last one would be the real climax.    Boy, was I wrong. Mockingjay loses any connection between what made the first book so great. This book isn't about Katniss, it isn't about Peeta - or even her sister or Gale for that matter. It's about a pointless war and getting as many characters together that you can ultimately kill - just so you can say; \\"Yeah, this is war, anyone can die!\\". There is so much emphasis on war and Katniss now only exists to be a spokesperson for the war, and that's all she ever does. Peeta is lacking through half the story, as he was kidnapped, and Peeta is what makes the series enjoyable - so most of the time, I just wanted to hurry up and skip some pages so I could see my favourite character again. I mean what else could I possibly look forward to when all Katniss does is do absolutely pointless things and bring people in danger?    When Peeta does come back, he's been brainwashed - it was interesting to say the least, but it tore him from his original personality. During the course of the story, they try to un-brainwash Peeta by telling him some things are real, and some things aren't. Again, it was interesting, but Collins never used this potential to create it into a great story on its own. No, everything was about war, death and ambushes. Most of the times, it was just something in the background - talk about your missed moments.    And then comes the final act of the book, where Katniss decides it's a GREAT idea to go and kill Snow on her own. She drags a few people with her in the process, who will ALL DIE in stupid and pointless ways - again Collin misses moments she could have written in a much more interesting way. Then when Katniss is finally in front of Snow's building, all the rebels come rushing in, basically making her entire trip (and the deaths of all the characters who went with her) totally pointless. She achieved nothing. A bomb get detonated, her sister dies in yet another missed moment that could have been written so much better (I didn't think her death was sad at all).    Then, all of these missed moments of great writing potential should be handwaved because Katniss eventually decides to kill Coin instead of Snow? I'm sorry but, the entire book was utterly devoid of entertainment, and everything they did was pointless - I am not going to say this is a great book because Katniss did one thing right. ONE thing.    Oh, and the one thing that really pushed me to give this a two rating, the moment after the war, where Katniss could re-bond with Peeta again got a one page description. One page. Apparently Collin's characters don't deserve at least a full chapter where they try to trust each other again. Nope, just one page is enough to say that Peeta is still insane sometimes, but keeps it in check, and they slept with each other and got kids. Yup, it deserved only one page. I was pretty pissed after that. After a full book of war and pointless deaths, I get one page that might have been the best chapter had it actually been written in the entire book.    I'll just pretend The Hunger Games is not a trilogy.
B00275EHJG|5.0|OH MY GOSH! Just when I thought there couldn't be a better Toy Story, Pixar jolted me out of that state of mind! This was so good ... I even cried! I love all three of these movies, and I'm 50something! Added this to my collection ... when is the next one?
B00005JM02|4.0|December 16th, 2010<br /><br />This is an all-around great movie. I watched it for the first time today. I heard people gush over it so much at this website but hadn't seen it previously. I was gonna buy it but maybe I'll wait to see if it comes down in price at all.<br /><br />The animation is beyond top-notch. Must say that first. The water looks really realistic, certain sea creatures such as the shark look extremely intimidating and most of the fish are quite colorful. The body of water they explore can be colorful too, but usually it's quite brooding and dark.<br /><br />Which brings me to what I said in my title: This movie can be viewed by kids but some of the younger and impressionable ones (ages 3, 4 and maybe 5) may find it a bit scary at times.<br /><br />The story itself is also kinda dark at times. I enjoyed it but some may find it sad.<br /><br />The characters are great. Nemo is great, his father Marlin was cool but my favorite by far was the absent-minded Dory. Boy, was she a character! While I did smile a few times during the movie, she was the first character to make me laugh. Near the end I almost cried.<br /><br />In the end, it's a good movie but maybe you as a parent, babysitter or what-have-you, should watch it first to make sure it's alright for the kids. If they are 6 or above, I see no problem with them watching this.<br /><br />4 stars or an 8/10.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|The behind-the-scenes DVD contains some great footage from back in '77-78. It's fun to see a younger Bruce full of the same energy he packs more than 3 decades later.  The concert DVD's are also high class and The Promise audio CD's contain some really fantastic songs. Most of them have not been released on studio albums before and some are alternate takes on Bruce's famous songs.  A must-buy for fans.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Thanx for the fast delivery and for finding the address!!! It arrived before xmas, very pleased with the product! : )
0312600844|2.0|I have such mixed feelings about this book, that I'm having trouble gathering my thoughts.  It started off slow, and I was close to bailing.  The diary seemed to pretty much repeat the first section.  He needs the diary device for later, so why not just drop the first section?  It makes the book feel over-written.  The plot is at times confusing and hard to follow.  I had a hard time with the whole MTR issue.    The title is ironic.  It appears that each character is least happy when they choose freedom.  I like this book best when it focuses on Joey.  He's the most fully-fleshed and understandable of them all.  I may not like him, but his motivation is always clear.  Patty is my least favorite.  She just seems evil and manipulative.  It's impossible to figure out why she does anything, especially in her final appearance.  Walter is also hard to peg, except for the fact that he embodies every cliche of political corectness in our times.  His resolution to his relationship with Patty is puzzling at best.    I felt like I was \\"supposed\\" to read this book after all the hype.  I should have believed the very mixed Amazon reviews instead of all the 10 Best lists.  There's so many wonderful books out there, and I wish I had just saved my time.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|I've been an Annie Lennox fan ever since the first Eurythmics album.  I wasn't sure about a Christmas album with her unique style, but WOW...this CD surprised me.  Her unique style and take animate many songs that are so monotonous.  The arrangements are full, with details throughout.  This wasn't just an artist deciding to record a Christmas CD, but one produced and performed with intent and thoughtfulness.  I'm a huge Christmas fan and this is one collection of songs that will be in my iTunes Christmas arrangement.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Since this is a terribly late review, ill keep it short.    A lot of good ideas stretched out over too much disc.  While no song is particularly bad, there is nothing all that great on here.  Mostly 6-8/10's, but not 10/10s.  Suicide and Redemption is bland and boring and a prime example of how Metallica puts way too little music over way too much space.    The tones on this album aren't very good.  Too dirty, not tight or crisp like metal should be.  Guitar solos are just plain terrible.  Uninspired, repetitive, lacking direction, melody, and diversity.  makes sense why he wasn't really on the last one.    I don't get it, Kirk's only REAL solo with any sort of worth is on Fuel, and everybody knows that song is on a terrible album of no guitar solos.    If I had reviewed this when it first came out, I would have given it a 5/5 as well.  But after the excitement of a decent Metallica product wore off, it became pretty apparent that there is nothing stellar about the album.      Check out Helloween's 7 sinners, Overkill's Ironbound, Opeth's Ghost Reveries, or Megadeth's Endgame if you want to hear what modern metal production is supposed to sound like.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|As a regular British customer of Amazon I sometimes get my .com's confused with my .co.uk's, and end up on the American website instead.  So I sometimes find myself reading the comments of American reviewers when I am expecting to read the domestic varieties.  In recent times it has become a revelation to discover how even the most obscure productions from British television broadcasters have such an appreciative audience across the pond.  The apparent popularity of Sir David Attenborough over there is equally surprising as he has a reputation of being more of a professional zoologist, a scientist and an educator over here.   For all his virtues Sir David could never be described as being glamorous.  Our TV newsreaders for example, are universally plain, or even pug-ugly so as not to distract the audience from news broadcasts that have to be taken seriously. To those who prefer a `cuddly' and sentimental  view of Mother Nature, Sir David's commentaries might come across as rather too academic and a bit too serious to be taken in large doses.   Those of us who prefer to view nature \\"Red in Tooth and Claw\\" in all its raw, bloody cruelty, and are not put off in the slightest by the commentary sounding more like a lecture; and do not feel the need to be spoon-fed `Factoids' instead- then Sir David Attenborough is the man to front such a show.  He is a wildly popular media star in Britain. A `national treasure' that I think helps to explain why he tends to spend almost as much time in front of the camera as the flora and fauna he is describing.  I think most British viewers like it this way because we simply can't get enough of him.  My bookshelves are lined with BBC/Attenborough productions in DVD, and I thought that that would be that.  And then along came Blu-ray!  Wondering what all the fuss was about, I purchased this edition of `Life' in this new format as a kind of experiment.  There is no doubt that the images and sound are something of a revelation.  Although this production is a sort of condensed version of stuff that has already been published and I've seen most of it before, I am so glad I bought this.  Now I'm faced with the alarming prospect of having to gradually replace my whole Attenborough collection with these new Blu-ray versions when they are eventually released.  There is an alternative version of `Life' available narrated by Oprah Winfrey that is suitable for children, and grown-ups with short attention spans.
0240816250|5.0|Wow, this is an extraordinary book.  This has got to be the most complete book on the subject of black and white imagery I've ever come across.  It also distinguishes itself by being very up to date on modern technology.  If you're interested in this subject this book is required reading!
B004EQAVHI|4.0|I can't wait to buy this film, even though the trailer spoils the whole movie... I still watched it and I plan to buy it. Even though I knew what was going to happen, it still made me cry buckets. The acting is simply wonderful and the cinematography is beautiful. It reminds me of the cinematography of Young Victoria. Beautiful movie.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|I think this film is fabulous.  It starts with a seemingly wacky premise and grand vistas.  Gradually the nature of the main character's life unfolds in front of your eyes as the film moves progressively from one location to the next.  Burt Lancaster is well cast- both in regard to the impressive physique he has the age he was at the time but also as regards the obvious signs of aging that are present at the same time.    Other actors are great as well (esp. Janice Rule)  (many exuding a quirky quality).  The cinematograpy and cinematic choices are first rate.  The film works well on many levels (surrealistic, mythic).  No review of the film is complete withour recognizing the author of this wonderfullly quirky premise- namely John Cheever- and this film explores themes of suburban angst, image, and the American dream with equal panache and skill.
1400052173|5.0|Ordinarily, I read fiction. But this book caught my eye. When I read what it was about, I knew that I had heard of how some cells taken from some woman in the 1950's were still replicating to this day, so I thought it would be interesting to hear the story of that woman.    \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is so much more than the story of the cells. Skloot's hard work and research paint a beautifully detailed picture of the life of a woman whose unknowing contribution changed the world of medicine. And Skloot's relationship with the family of Henrietta Lacks gives the authenticity, credibility, and the honesty that is due.    I highly recommend this book. And although I have never been one to keep up with scientific research, this book is written in a style that makes the science interesting and easy to understand. But it is the story of the relationship with the family of Henrietta Lacks that moved me the most, and even brought me to tears.
B003TXKSWK|5.0|I know everyone is entitled to their own view or opinion, but the problem I have is that every time a musician, emcee or singer decides to pump some positivity the work gets over analyzed and critiqued. The Roots & John Legend are just trying to turn the minds of the people to think more positive, to be more self-aware. If a cat is talking about \\"slap a b****\\" or \\"kick a h**\\" or the usual \\"I get money look at my car & jewels\\" the cd gets a 4 or 5 star rating. It used to be cool to sing about love in the community or rap about being proud & educated. I guess The Roots & John Legend are only speaking truth to power to only a few folks. Instead of \\"waking up!\\" cats is still asleep. The state of music in really screwed up.
B001TH8UUA|1.0|I bought the cables only a few weeks ago. At first they worked fine with no problems at all and the picture was great. However, just the other day they stopped working properly. The image would disappear and reappear constantly and then eventually fully disappear. I am currently in the process of returning them for a refund. Not recommended.

0061122416|5.0|It's the time of the year when I love to buy many copies of the Alchemist books as presents to friends and love ones.  I was fortunate to find this book through a friend who told me \\"you need to read this book....you need to read this book....\\" and I did, not only did I read it once but many times.  This book has changed my life.  It gives me the courage & strength to pursue my dream - my personal legend.  Every time I have double in life, I go back to it and read it some more.
B003UNNB1O|5.0|I could not find a description on this product anywhere online.  So I finally broke down and purchased the item.  Although it came slightly dinged up, and of course a few peg holders were broken out (not sure where one can replace a CD tray in a metal box???), but alas, that's S&H -- or improper handling for you.  So what do you get???  A cool metal box.  And the original full digital recording (DDD) CD found in the regular album, albeit the print on the CD is all black, there's no Elektra red circle.  The phamphlet insert is pretty much the same, but the second half is in German (hence, where it was pressed); but, instead of the solid black back cover of the regular album, it has a second picture, much-like the front, but Tracy is smiling, that was a nice surprise.    If you like cool packaging (like myself) and like to collect everything, go for it.  But there's no enhancement of sound quality or added material, or any second disc of videos.  But shoot, it's a GREAT album.

In more complex stories, the need to overcome the FBI is often added as an element. Since 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security often comes in as a fourth group of cross-interest.<br /><br />Hell's Corner leaves all those \\"simple\\" plots behind by adding several more layers and levels of cross-purposes and hidden motives. It's enough to frustrate all but the most dedicated lovers of conspiracy theories. If you don't like such crosscurrents, this book may move in too complicated and slow ways for you.<br /><br />In the earliest Camel Club books, the whole club is engaged in \\"saving\\" the United States from early in the story. In Hell's Corner, it takes almost half the book before the Camel Club begins to be fully active. Even then, the Camel Club is not the center of the story. The book is really about Oliver Stone (aka John Carr) and his conflict with arch enemies who have him covered. So if you really enjoy the parts of the series about the Camel Club members, this book may seem light to you in that regard.<br /><br />Actually, the book is a throwback to the assassin versus assassin stories that were so popular in the 1970s and 1980s . . . with the complication of a strange mystery to solve.<br /><br />The book does have some interesting qualities, beginning with an improbable series of events that have a most unexpected explanation. It takes a long time for the answer to be revealed, and the book becomes much more interesting and fast paced from that point on. I'll never look at Lafayette Park in the same way again.<br /><br />Ultimately, I thought that the book was a little too complex and slow to get to the solution to the mystery to be fully satisfying. Then, the events toward the end were a little too dramatic . . . seeming to fit better with James Bond than with the Camel Club. It's as though Mr. Baldacci felt that a good story about the Camel Club wouldn't appeal to us, so he is taking the series off on a new tack where the fate of the world is at stake. The writing loses much of its charm in the process.<br /><br />But it's certainly an imaginative story that kept me up late to finish it. I felt as if less would have been more in this case.<br /><br />Once again, the Kindle price seems awfully high compared to the discounted hardcover price. Why don't publishers like people who own Kindles?little too dramatic . . . seeming to fit better with James Bond than with the Camel Club.

030746363X|5.0|Most of the things discussed in this book are not new.  However, to have all this info pulled together into a single volume is fantastic.  The author has gone to the cutting edge of a number of different physical disciplines and areas of study, and communicates what he's learned in an agreeable, easily digestible style.  I highly recommend this book.
B0037KMHRY|2.0|This album sounds more like the Risky Business soundtrack done by Tangerine Dream rather than a work done by Daft Punk.  Even though this is a movie soundtrack, I expected more energy from the Daft Punk duo.  I hope this is not the end of Daft Punk like when Toto did the Dune soundtrack.
B00009V93Z|5.0|I was concerned when I read this at the bottom:  \\"Every effort has been made to achieve optimum sound quality.  However, priority has been given to historic content.\\"  But this must apply only to CD 1.  The sound for the 1972 concert on CD 4 is great and the concert itself is excellent, though not different from other concerts during the era.  There's not a weak song in tshe entire concert.  For The Good Times is the prettiest he's ever done.  The gritty version of Burning Love is interesting.  It was before his studio recording of tbe song and he doesn't get all the words right.    I like Elvis's 60s music best and CDs 2 and 3 demonstrative how beautifully he could sing tender ballads.  Examples are Lonely Man, No More, Starting Today, and I Met Her Today.  But the gutsy songs like Make Me Know It and His Latest Flame are also standouts.  The alternate takes demonstrate Elvis perfectionism during this period since they are almost as good as the released versions.    CD 1 is the least interesting since similar recordings have been previously released.    There are better ways to begin an Elvis collection, but this is a worthy addition for true fans.
B0046IGOIO|4.0|Being a long time doors fan I enjoyed this show. Yes the audio quality is not as good as Detroit, Boston, Pittsburg and other shows from the 1970 tour but it is a very good show. The whole band is on point and the set list is strong. There is a bit of a hiss that is easy to hear and the start of the show should have been cut down a bit but this is the complete show the way that it was played back in 1970.    The fact that Albert King joins the band for 4 songs is a real treat. You can tell that they all were in great spirits and enjoyed playing with him. In my opinion this is the best part of the first disc. There is a bit of space between songs but it is a bootleg and that should be expected.    The second disc is very good and closing with the End is amazing. Jim was not drunk at this show and the band were at top form. If you enjoy the doors live you should get this one. Overall I gave this show four stars and would have given it five if the audio quality was better. Now don't get me wrong it is not that bad and it is worth buying for the Albert King infused blues parts of the first disc.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I love this movie, it's just as good as the other two, and the end made me cry as well as the part when they we're all about to be burned, that part is pretty dark for young children, I Loved Loved LOVed Spanish Buzz, he was a crack up, especially with the way he was charming Jesse and the tango at the end was great! The movie wasn't the same without Jim Varney doing the voice of slinky-dog, but Blake Clark did a pretty good job, and I missed bo-peep.
0316069485|4.0|This was a solid Michael Connelly book. I really liked having Haller and Bosch work a case together. The guest appearances of people like Rachel Walling and other characters added to it. The book was very good, but far from great. If you like his books, I'd say read it... but it wasn't his best book.
B000002LIX|5.0|For Alternative Rock this album is the essence of cool. I can Definitely listen to it all the way through every time and you will too after a few listens. Once you really get a grip on the lyrics and the style of singing the whole theme comes together and story of the album takes you over. Right up there with Siamese dream and Superunknown and Ten for greatest of the Mainstream Alt Rock albums, I'm not even gonna go into the Melvins, that's a whole nother can o' worms. Don't forget that name though especially if your new to this stuff. Check out this album it will rock your car system for weeks!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I picked this book up after finishing 4 hour work week. The picture on the cover currently hangs above my desk. As an author myself, having recently published the book \\"You Have A College Degree, Now What?\\" the idea of conquering achievements in life that most deem impossible is what drew me to this book. Can one book provide you all the answers you're searching for? In a nutshell, no. But, one book can put you on a thought process and pattern that you may not have been aware existed. This book is well worth the read. Congrats to Tim. He's done it again. A superb read.

0393320928|4.0|I have read \\"you must be joking Mr. Feyman\\" but this book \\"what do you care what other people think\\" talks about the intellectual aspects of Mr. Feyman. It certainly caught my attention of how science is done and difficult it is to solve certain problems in science, which may have direct application on the society. Definitely recommend it.
B000G7599Y|5.0|Best complete set, tight, correct tempos, superior recording sound. Bohm is genius in these recordings!<br />The other set you may wish to consider in the last 6, is Bruno Walter's Columbia SO, early 60's.<br />Not sure if still avaliable,,,not the Walter/NY,,<br />I've compared Walter/Columbia, Bohm/BErlin,,extremely close in all aspects.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|There really is no better kids trilogy than Pixar's \\"Toy Story\\".  This is a great set with tons of bonus and special features!  The only negative is that the DVDs don't come in a plastic or even paper sleeve.
B00447RAF8|1.0|I've been a fan of Calexico since their \\"Spoke\\" album release in 1997 and can confidently suggest you keep your original version of \\"Feast of Wire\\" and steer clear of this (not so) Deluxe Version.    Disc One Review - the full length album. First off, this is NOT remastered. It is the same quality as the U.S. domestic released seven years ago. No effort what so ever was put into this re-release, it is a clone of the original. To add further insult, the original import release contained a 17th track named \\"Fallin' Rain\\" which does not appear here.    Disc Two Review - (the easy to find/obtainable)Rarities. It is quite literally a rip off to include a second disc dressed up in a Deluxe Edition that runs only 40 minutes or so. A half empty disc that is also not remastered and is actually of poorer quality than the EP released versions of the same songs is, again, unacceptable. These bonus tracks (or in truth various EP tracks) sound as if they were transferred from cassette and when compared audibly to the orginal EP sources sound muddy and dull.    Calexico is a great band and these complaints are directed at the format of this release. \\"Feast of Wire\\" is a remarkable release- this version is ultimately disappointing and my one star score is in reference to that alone.

B000PKX2KA|5.0|I bought this product to replace a ND-100S dongle GPS unit.  It is more sensitive, finds the satellites much more quickly, and seems to be about as accurate as any.  Indoors, I left it running on a shareware tracking program (GPS Utility) for about 2 hours and the track stayed within a box about 30'x 30'.  Outdoors, it should be better.  For Windows 7, I used the installation program for Vista.

B002ZG99QS|3.0|Before I review Tron:  Legacy, I feel I should point out that I have little emotional connection to the original Tron film, a movie which I thought had a very unique idea, but was at the same time an average film that had a nifty visual style, but a plot that felt muddled with no real goal or purpose, and was mostly a showcase for the film's look.  Now, almost thirty years later, Tron has finally gotten a sequel that delivers pretty much more of the same, but adds an interesting dimension to this digital universe.    Tron:  Legacy begins back in 1989.  Kevin Flynn, now a rich and wildly successful CEO of ENCOM International, talks with his son, Sam, about the Tron universe.  But like almost all happy families in films, things fall apart.  Kevin vanishes, and Sam grows up an unhappy, fatherless kid.  But one day, Kevin sends a page, and Sam heads to the old arcade his father frequented, and soon finds himself inside the Tron world, and finds himself involved in a plot that could introduce both worlds to each other...with disastrous consequences.     At first glance, Tron delivers a mixed experience...the visuals, as to be expected, are incredible, full of sleek, shiny, yet dark technology that has fused to create a world of haunting, electronic beauty, full of dazzling black and neon that feels artificial, yet real at the same time, as if this place really exists in a world different from our own.  Yet, on the story level, Tron:  Legacy feels as muddled as it's predecessor.  The visuals and the world itself take the spotlight, and the script feels somewhat aimless, moving along without a greater theme or meaning (There is a subplot about life that spontaneously appears and could change humanity's perception on everything, but it doesn't really go anywhere), and when it's over, it feels somewhat empty.     However, there is an unexpected surprise within the story...while Sam and Quorra are supposed to be the main characters, it's Kevin and Clu who steal the spotlight,as they share an almost religious relationship, with Kevin being God, and Clu being the devil, who started out good, but eventually sought to rule the Tron world.  The relationship between the two is fascinating and compelling to watch, and I really wish the movie had focused completely on the two of them, and the idea that the God of the Tron world has lost control of his creation, and now has to deal with the consequences.    In the end, Tron: Legacy is a fun sequel.  Despite the weak story, it's fantastic visuals, fascinating relationship between Kevin and CLU (who is really a digitally de-aged Jeff Bridges, an effect pulled off very well), and great action moments help to make it a fun experience worth seeing.  It doesn't hit masterpiece status, but it gets pretty close, and in that aspect, it's a worthy successor to the original.

B003X73QA8|5.0|I have been bemoaning the death of great music for several years now.  The music played on the radio today is, for the most part, unlistenable unless you are 12 years old.  Once upon a time, musicians played instruments, wrote melodies and sang without the help of auto tune software.  Today it seems, music is made by downloading beats and sampling (aka copying) music other people wrote 20+ years ago.  Then along comes Arcade Fire and my hopes are once again high.  Haunting melodies, complex arrangements, meaningful lyrics and near perfect vocals.  Although I love \\"Funeral\\" and \\"Neon Bible\\", \\"The Suburbs\\" is their masterpiece...it's this bands \\"Automatic for the People\\" or \\"Joshua \\"Tree\\" or \\"OK Computer\\". This isn't just the best album of 2010, it's the best thing to happen musically in a decade.

B00001OH7P|2.0|Sure Ziggy Stardust and Suffragette City still stand as great songs...but primarily fans of the early Rolling Stones will appreciate the rest of the period-specific music approach.  If you haven't purchased this album, I strongly suggest you listed to all the previews and then decide whether this is your cup of tea.  So, I'm not writing this review from a historical perspective and this review doesn't reflect the historical significance of this album in the annals of Rock, but rather whether it's worth listening to today on its own terms...and in that regard I find it lacking.
0307588343|5.0|Lawrence McDonald and Patrick Robinson do a terrific job at explaining the events, decisions, and hubris that lead to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing aftermath that made the whole world shudder. The authors give the reader a detailed look at the events that shaped the culture of carelessness and greed, the various forces around the world and within Lehman itself, and the people who made or failed to make key decisions. They intimately describe analysts, traders, and managing directors at Lehman who predicted the catastrophe and did what they could to forewarn the leadership of the impending dangers, as well as people who continued to dismiss such warnings as rubbish until the clock of doom ran out.    The subject is poignant, the flow of the narrative is smooth, and the occasional humor is punishing and razor-sharp. As a standalone point, the depiction of \\"Mighty King Richard\\", or Dick Fuld, CEO and Chairman of Lehman who is responsible to a great extent for the demise of the prestigious 150-year bank, give this book tremendous value.    An important take away from their story is that not all at Lehman Brothers and Wall Street shared the voracious greed so frequently associated with traders, bankers, and brokers.    Alongside telling the Lehman story, Mr. McDonald gives an account of his own arduous journey to Wall Street, the Mecca of finance where the alleged guardians of people's money lived and worked. Working with the best of the industry at Lehman Brothers was a fulfillment of his dreams and he tells how he got there.     This book has many lessons for the astute and the auspicious and is a very enjoyable read.    GL
0634022296|5.0|This book is great, I've had it for years, and I recently purchased one for a friend who just started playing guitar. The book is as advertised-all of the Beatles songs with chords. I am not an expert on the Beatles discography, so they might have left one out, but there's a lot of stuff in here. Understand that if you purchase this it's not going to give you the fingerpicking for songs like Blackbird, and some of the Beatles' tunes work really great with just the chords as written...some not so much. You'd have to work really hard to create an authentic sounding version of \\"come together,\\" but others like \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" are easier to work out. I personally take books like this to an office supply store and have the binding cut off and replaced with a spiral binding, so they lay flat on a music stand.
B003ZVJFFM|2.0|Story:<br />This is VERY different in many respects from the Dickens story. There are some glaring changes that really take away from the beauty of this classic story.<br /><br />Changes for 3D effect:<br />1. The &#34;flying&#34; effect with the Ghost of Christmas Present was not, was not even implied, in the Dickens story.<br />2. Scrooge being chased around the streets of London after meeting the Ghost of Christmas Future.<br />3. Scrooge being shrunk to the size of a mouse, running around the London sewers, snowboarding with an icicle, and getting nearly pounded by Joe the rag and bones man.<br /><br />Changes made for no apparent reason:<br />1. Many important scenes are left out that show the progression of Scrooge from greedy miser to keep of Christmas all year long.<br />2. The Ghost of Christmas Present dies, rots to a skeleton, turns to dust, and is blown away by the wind.<br /><br />One change that really, really got on my nerves was the Ghost of Christmas Present making a dig at &#34;men of the cloth.&#34; I don't know if the writer/director/producer was trying to be overtly anti-Christian here, but that's surely the way it comes off. (Which makes you wonder why they'd make a movie about the miracle of Christmas if they want to be anti-Christian.)<br /><br />The result is a movie that falls well short of the great film it could have been. For one, it scared my daughter (3 years old) quite a bit; the movie is loud and spends a lot of time getting &#34;in your face&#34; for the 3D effects. Also, have I mentioned that the Ghost of Christmas Present, who of course looks a lot like Santa, DIES...and TURNS INTO A SKELETON!<br /><br />There are some nice extras on the disk. I like watching the technical features about motion-capture, but I had to laugh out loud when the directors, actors, producer, etc. were talking about &#34;how true they stayed to Dickens' story.&#34;<br /><br />The story adaptation gets 0 stars, all the little changes add up to this being not a very good telling of the story. The motion-capture, including how amazingly lifelike the facial features came out, gets 5 stars.ot a very good telling of the story.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|You'd think that a movie with 4 Academy Award Nominations and over 80 4-star rave reviews would be decent, but no. The Academy award nominations for this movie were so freaking relyable I nodded off and, God help me, fantasised about watching [[ASIN:B00003CXIV Battlefield Earth]]. Dont buy this crap movie. Lost in Translation is the most boring, unfunny, plotless, villianless movie I ever saw. This whole thing is 30 mintues of unfunny commercial retakes and Murray sitting at a bar, followed by an hours worth of dating scenes. How in the hell did this thing get so much praise, anyway?? I thought this movie would AT LEAST reveal a secret lover or SOMETHING! but nope.    The disc sucks almost as much as the movie does. ALMOST. It throws at you a ton of unskippable movie trailers before you get to the main menu, but thats not as much a bad thing as is sounds. the legion of unskipple trailers are in fact, preparring you for what is to come; the insane, frusterating wait to get to the main menu is but the mere introduction... to the insane, frusterating wait for the movie to be over. You see, I am the kind of person that, if I rent or buy something, I see it all the way to the end no matter what... but Lost in Translation almost became an exception. In fact, it practically was, because i fell asleep probably 6 times during this thing but never once did I become Lost in Duration. Even inbetween napping sessions, I knew exactly what was gioing on and I really, really, REALLY diddn't care.
0316066524|1.0|Comparing Wallace to Pynchon is like comparing a kettle of sponges to Disney World.  One is pointless inanity, and the other is entertaining and interesting.      I tried, very hard, to like this book...I tried for years.  I finally broke down and read analyses of his writing, critiques and speculation about the meaning of the writing...  ...and it appears that he is that guy in the college coffee shop, scribbling in his diary because \\"no one understands the profound truth and emotion that he has discovered.\\"  I get it.  I just really don't care.  There are plenty of those people who do appreciate DFW...and I likely wouldn't be able to stand those people.      If you want 'highbrow reading with menaning' Read Kafka or Sartre for more prosaic insight into the human condition, or Dostoyevsky for a better narrative.  If you want intellectually elitist literature, read Foucault's Pendulum.  If you want to be warm, burn your overrated copy of Infinite Jest.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Regardless of the polarizing reviews, this is an interesting more \\"modern\\" commercial effort, and one that I applaud as a good adventure.  There are times when Groban's voice is in starkly naked form and sounds truly \\"honest\\" for lack of a better descriptor.  Unfortunately, there are other times when his more classical sound pulls fairly far back into the throat and loses a good deal of beauty and point in the process.  Groban's voice is still readily identifiable and full of the expected color and mannerisms that make it what it is, but there are several moments that needed a retake after some adjusting for vocal placement.  London Hymn in particular is nearly painful to listen to.  Odd choices in diphthong handling in Bells of New York are also a bit off-putting. I am concerned that he seems to be using more and more glottal releases in the classical production and trying to generate a darker tone than his core sound.  There are moments that you can hear studio \\"manipulation\\" to brighten some of the more oddly produced sounds.  Not a bad album, but rather inconsistent at times.  I REALLY am enjoying the lighter pop style on most of the tracks though.

0061373877|2.0|I can't bear to finish this book. It draws each scene so thoroughly as to take me completely out of the plot. I'd love to say the description. I normally love descriptive detail of this nature and it amplifies the setting however the way in which Gaiman reiterates the original descriptions of characters has me baring my teeth and closing my eyes in pain.<br /><br />This would be forgivable if the characters were worth caring about. As of now, literally 50% of the way through the wordy tale, I couldn't give a flying crap about any of them. The main character is dull, lifeless, and a pansy. The girl he follows is without a personality and the plot twists are so slow and overwrought that I just wish the story was over. As of now I'm going to go on Wikipedia and read the notes so I don't have to finish this book and waste any more of my life on this poorly construed \\"fantasy novel.\\" If you have to read something by Gaiman I'd pick American Gods. If you want a real author of fantasy with a twist of reality go for the Ender Novels by Orson Scott Card

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was a great series on the founding of the nation mainly and obviously centered around John Adams.  Its great also that they show a little bit of the 6th president at a young age, John's son; John Quincy Adams.  Abigail plays a great role as well and the the series has some of the finest of actors playing great parts.  My favorite part since I love economics was in the 4th part of the series almost at the very start when Jefferson and Hamalton are talking about the central bank.  I am an advocate of the Jeffersonian school and not the Hamaltonian school but the great discussion goes on at the table in which Hamalton proceeds to say that we need a deficit to affect trade and debt to bring centralized power to the government.  Jefferson explicitly states and was his view that the war would have been in vain if such a thing was to occur.  Also stating that the south would be working to help the north out and also to pay out to the bank of england.  THis is one of the main reasons for the CIVIL WAR which is amazing that the series had captured this.  Obviously if you have know your American history, this was a great issue and even more so at the time.  Its just a great series that captures lots of things and brings such to life for the person today. Great sereies.
0307346617|5.0|This book is a really great piece of work by author Max Brooks. Basically, it's a collection of recollections from several key survivors of the inevitable zombie apocalypse (let's face it, we all know and accept its gonna happen, right?) told in an interview format. If you like this sort of fare, you will absolutely love this book. Each character is brought to life by their individual dialogues and the various scenarios presented in the book are vividly realized. What I love most about the book is that its taken seriously by the author and feels very authentic. I highly recommend this book, especially if you like movies like Romero's Dead films and the recent Walking Dead series, both the comic and TV versions.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|If you enjoy holiday music that is creative and unique than this is the album for you.  Annie's vocals are spot on and the arrangements and instrumentation are incredible.  I was pleasantly surprised by this album and it has already become one of my favorites.  I would even listen to this throughout the year as it is somewhat relaxing and inspirational.  Annie's unique personality shines through and for that we are taken on a musical journey and transported to different times and places.  I would compare the music to that of Madrigals (as another reviewer mentioned), Celtic, Enya [[ASIN:B000002LRR Watermark]] or Loreena McKennitt [[ASIN:B000J233SK Book of Secrets]], but with Annie's personal touch at the forefront of the arrangements.  Definitely worth a listen!
B002OOG6RQ|1.0|Don't buy this CD.<br /><br />I would say up to this point I've been a Rammstein fan. As someone who really enjoyed their earlier work, despite having read the translated lyrics, I expected the translations for this album to be difficult to stomach. However, I also expected to be so moved by the music that any upset from the lyrics would be forgotten.<br /><br />Well, Rammstein finally came up with lyrics that even I couldn't handle. Coming from a fan of Marilyn Manson's early work and a number of other \\"provocative\\" acts from the '90s, that should tell you something. And as if the translated lyrics weren't horrid enough (blatant hatred of women, explicit and implied raunchy sex, etc.), the album art was filled with dying, dead, and dismembered women. Oh, did I mention that the members of the band can be seen in some of the pictures (including the cover) cutting the women apart with knives, axes, saws, etc.? It was so bad I stopped halfway through my first listen and threw out the whole thing.<br /><br />I'm all for art that assaults the viewer/listener, but there's a limit. This album took a flying leap over it, then it danced on the bodies of the dozen or so female corpses that are strewn all over the album art. Any album that has to be sold in an opaque overwrap with a sticker covering the name of a certain song falls outside the realm of decency. This offering from Rammstein is beyond the pale. I doubt I'll ever be able to consider buying one of their CDs again.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, don't buy this disc.
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|\\"The last song\\" is a disturbing but honest film based -if you may- on a thousand times told story: the powerful emotional barrier between father and daughter who avoid them to establish a standard relationship. She is a talented pianist who refused to play, while he lives tormented and isolated due two reasons. The summer holiday will become for them genesis and nemesis and will carve in relief their differences and approaches.<br /><br />The love for music will be the driving force that eventaully will tie them again, when love makes its appearance at the service of redemtion and forgiveness.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear gives a touching performance as the dying father, but the flaw is Miley Cyrus' performance, flat and inexpressive. The splendid photograph and an agile script save and enhance this summer movie.

0765326353|5.0|I've read this genre for only a year now, going through most of the bigger titles--Malazan, Wheel of Time, Game of thrones, Name of the Wind, and even the Sword of Truth. But I have to say, this one is right up there with the best. It just might be the best. Lucid and flowing, you'll zip through a 1000 pages before you know it. The characters are fleshed out and unforgettable, the plot is compelling, and there are some really cool ideas here, from super-powered suits of armour, to swords that appear like lightsabers. There's even an assassin who runs on walls and ceilings. Several action scenes are mindblowing. This book would make a fantastic movie. I couldn't give a stronger recommendation.
B000001ES9|5.0|Still the best of the 1st 3 albums and a great album in it's own right.  There is not a single dud on this album and Alex, Geddy, and John all play great.  Especially, of note is John Rutsey on drums who plays some great skins on the album, while when he left the band we did gain the great Neil Peart on drums and songwriting (and he is one of my favorite drummers and writers), it would have been interesting to see what would have happened if the original lineup had remained together.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|Well, it's finally here.  TRON: Legacy.  The one you've been waiting for.  The denouement to the movie year.  The ne plus ultra of cinematic splendor.  The cherry on the 3D ice cream cone- look, they even digitized the Disney logo!  Oooh, shiny...<br /><br />The movie begins in 1989 with Kevin Flynn (Bridges) telling his young son Sam a bedtime story about the amazing adventures he'd had in The Grid, the virtual world he discovered.  Flynn leaves for Encom, only to never be seen again.  Flash forward to 2010 and Sam is breaking into Encom's servers- now a soulless software corporation- to spread the source code for their new software release.  Subtle.<br /><br />Sam investigates a claim that his father contacted his former BFF Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and gets zapped into The Grid and is immediately swept up in its deadly game-oriented culture where he gets the attention of CLU, Flynn's former avatar who's taken over their cyber-realm.  CLU is aided in this by Rinzler, his personal Darth Vader, which is more than enough of a hint.  Turns out Sam's presence here isn't quite so accidental and now he's got to find his father before CLU does.  The Grid has evolved into more than anyone imagined and CLU has some serious daddy issues and no therapist to talk to.  Flynn himself is the key to everything in both The Grid and the User's world and if CLU gets his mitts on him- Game over, man!  Game over!  But Flynn's not alone; he's aided by his beauteous apprentice Quorra, a program who's native to The Grid and dreams of a life in the real world.<br /><br />________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Seems like folks are way too caught up in the hype and are trying to make more of this movie than it is.  It's fluff and eye candy- grab your tub o' popcorn, put on them 3D specs and lean back in your stadium seat.  Like a friend of mine said- if you saw the original, you've seen this one.  The script and characters couldn't be more by-the-numbers if they came with a paint set.  Even in the relatively deeper moments there's little substance to them.  No mysteries of the universe tucked away in here... though Jeff Bridges' Flynn has taken up Zen and he does seem to be having fun channeling The Dude from Big Lebowski.  Even Michael Sheen's scene-chewing comic turn as Castor, androgynous club owner and rogue, gets boring fast.<br /><br />One thing that really annoyed me was the incessant game metaphors- 'he's changed the game', 'the game has changed', 'you're the new piece on the board', etc.  Ok, ok, we get it- next time could you only hit us over the head with a mallet instead of a sledgehammer?<br /><br />TRON: Legacy recycles everything from the original and adds a few new wrinkles, even if it doesn't all make sense.  Why does Sam have to break into Encom when he's the majority shareholder?  Why do you have a solar sailer in a world with no sunlight?  How'd you come up with roast pork and fresh veggies in The Grid... no, seriously- where did that come from?  Or all those hardcover books?  What's in those drinks everyone's having?  And why couldn't CLU just fly into Outland and find Flynn?  And why did...<br /><br />*sexy, shiny cyber-chick struts by*  Oooh, niiiice...<br /><br />TRON: Legacy is all about the SFX and in that it delivers big time.  Every vehicle, background and enhancement looks spectacular and the lightcycles and lightflyers are amazing and flawless.  I saw it in IMAX 3D- my first IMAX experience- and other than a few blurry spots it looked great, but I can live without it.  Even all the characters were color-coded to help you keep score: good guys are blue, bad guys are red and neutrals are day-glo white.  Kind of reminded me of Dragonlance.  The only downside to the CGI was Jeff Bridges' rendering- looked like his face was molded out of Play-doh.  And the Daft Punk soundtrack completely worked; the music fit the mood perfectly. No complaints there.<br /><br />TRON: Legacy isexactly what it's supposed to be- lots of pretty, glowing, fast moving objects and people.  Anything else would've been excessive.  Maybe even engaging.  But maybe there's room for that stuff in the next one, 'cause when Sam...<br /><br />*light cycle zooms by*  Oooh, pretty...oving objects and people.

031603973X|5.0|A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is a classic tale that has been told during the Christmas season for many generations. This version of the story is featured in a beautiful pop-up book created by Chuck Fischer that is sure to captivate even the youngest listeners at bedtime.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol is one of my favorite Christmas stories. I loved seeing the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. If this is one of your favorite tales, you will definitely want to check out this pop-up book to add to your library or Christmas goodies to share with your family.<br /><br />This version of the classic story is absolutely magnificent. The pop-ups are beautiful and includes a section of the story to go with each area that the adult can pull out to read to the children (or themselves) while looking at the expertly crafted pop-up page to go with it.<br /><br />I showed this book to my parents, and my Nana that was visiting from out of town when it arrived, and they all thought it was amazing. It is really a perfect book to add for your family to enjoy for generations (as long as little hands don't grab and tear the pop-ups). I highly recommend this book to everyone who loves the story and wants to pass it on to their children or grandchildren in a very special way.<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of A Christmas Carol, Little, Brown and Company, part of the Hachette Book Group for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|The guy writes a book that is success literature distilled, and that 4HWW was amazing. Most are too lazy to read and to research. If you try putting even half of what his first book offers into practice, you will take back much of the life you hand over to fear, the blahs, and that odd sense of lull. For even $50, you're welcome.    Now comes the 4HB. If you know Tim from his last book and blog, he tells you how to create a Muse. It tells you how to be him. He tells you that you (we) are all willing to believe in the buzz words, so it's okay to sell by using them. But he preaches that you must back it up. Give something serious. And Tim is serious, too much for most, because we are a soft people. God forbid we have to work or be held accountable!    For all the whining up front...the book hasn't been out long enough for 98% of you to have put his theories to the test. If you drop 5 pounds and even ONE person in your day notices, you know the book is worth the money you spent.     Tim's making money doing what he loves. Brave enough to put himself out there, rich and connected enough that he doesn't have to. So thats why he wrote a book to trick and lie to everyone.     I can't wait until he puts out 4 Hour Self-Accountability! I'm buying copies for everyone!
0060229357|1.0|Please check the size of the book before ordering.  I was shocked at how small it was.  The paperback is a bit shorter and a bit wider than a DVD case.     Great book, but felt like I paid $7 for a Happy Meal toy-book.    Other kids books like Ferdinand the Bull or Where the Wild Things among other classics seem to have no problem coming in a larger size at around the same price - give or take a few dollars.      Will probably return it.  Vote with your wallet.  Might get the hardcover instead, but the hardcover appears to be of a similar size.       I expected Dr. Seuss sized.  I got a cereal box prize size instead.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Everyone, including myself, seemed to be doubtful about Matt Smith as the new doctor, replacing the great David Tennant, who had brought a whole new generation and fan base to Doctor Who. Thankfully, all doubts were in vain. Series Five rocks, and I recommend to anyone who enjoys good writing, and fun sci-fi.
B003M5AXN4|4.0|The major complaint I heard about this movie was that it had no plot. I had to scratch my head and wonder if those people ever watched Speed Racer as kids. This movie had a terrific Speed Racer plot and does a fine job updating a 1960s series to modern day film.     I enjoyed this film immensely.

Not only did he test this stuff on himself but for some of the chapters has results from some of his blog followers.

0743455967|5.0|\\"This is not a textbook,\\" writes Stephen King of On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, and indeed, King's observation, like nearly all of those in the book, is astute. On Writing is no step-by-step guide, no collection of exercises to make the reader a best-selling novelist. King's goals, first of all, are not so lofty. \\"[I]t is impossible to make a competent writer out of a bad writer\\" (136), he says, and equally \\"impossible to make a great writer out of a good one\\" (136). But King does think that many people do have the talent to write and tell entertaining stories, and these talents, he believes, can at least \\"be strengthened and sharpened\\" (4).      To this end, King spends roughly half of the book offering a surfeit of practical advice on how to tell compelling and honest stories. Writers, he suggests, should be concise and should write directly, avoiding use of the passive voice. For grammar and style, writers would be smart to listen to Strunk and White. Writers, too, should trust their vocabularies, choosing the first word that comes to mind, so long as it is \\"appropriate and colorful\\" (110). No matter what their vocabulary tells them, writers should shun adverbs. And mapping out a plot, to King's mind, is unnecessary. If a writer puts characters in interesting situations, they will find their own ways out.    But for King, the writer's most powerful tool, it seems, is telepathy. According to King, reading is an act of shared consciousness, and it is through this communion that the learning writer comes to understand \\"about style, graceful narration, plot development, the creation of believable characters, and truth-telling\\" (141). Exposing writers to great writing--his own--is the most memorable feature and King's most useful strategy of On Writing. In the book's opening third, King relates tales, frustrating, humorous, sad, and inspiring, from his childhood and his early efforts to be a writer. And at the end of On Writing, in a section unplanned when he began the book, he narrates the tale of the terrible accident in which he was struck by a van and of the arduous struggle back to health afterward. King's own story and his narration of it here are as compelling as any of his novels.    On Writing truly has earned its reputation as an outstanding book on the subject of writing. It is admirable, first, for King's humble and practical approach to the craft. King's advice on writing is simple and sound, and he illustrates each of his counsels concretely and convincingly for the reader. Additionally, it is easy to imagine writers of diverse ages and abilities, and even writers working in different genres, understanding King's precepts and improving their writing as a result.      But most importantly, On Writing is successful because through it King makes such an articulate case for the value of writing. Reading King's stories and anecdotes in On Writing are both entertaining and insightful, great writing of the sort that may serve for as \\"a spur, goading the writer to work harder and aim higher\\" (141). And the story of King's recovery, which was facilitated in part by the way writing made his life \\"a brighter and more pleasant place\\" (275), demonstrates the enriching power of the art. Readers of On Writing will have acquired some tools to help them to write better stories, but more significantly, they may want to try.
1440419043|5.0|I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.<br />But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.<br />Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.<br /><br />Good:<br />There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!<br />The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".<br />The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.<br />I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!<br />Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).<br /><br />Bad:<br />Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).<br /><br />Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence<br />None. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybe The Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B001VNB54A|5.0|\\"The Pacific\\" is the story of American marines fighting in the Pacific during WW2.  So in some ways it is of the same genre as \\"Band of Brothers.\\"  I loved \\"Band of Brothers\\" and was very interested to see how \\"The Pacific\\" measured up.  The answer is that it measures up very well -- this is great entertainment and most viewers will not be disappointed.  This is not another \\"Band of Brothers.\\"  It is very different.  Firstly, \\"The Pacific\\" in my opinion is more gruesomely realistic even than \\"Band of Brothers.\\"  The battle scenes are fantastic and with Blu-Ray the realism is quite literally startling.  The entire production has a subtly authentic feel that is hard to describe.<br /><br />The characterizations are a bit weaker than Band of Brothers, but not bad for all that.  The acting is all pretty good, and contributes to the authentic feel of the production.  One gets a strong feeling for how tough the conditions were for our Armed Forces, and particularly the Marines, during the Pacific War, facing an implacable and powerful Japanese foe, with both sides miserable and far from home.  One cannot watch this production without gaining an appreciation for the sacrifices that our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen made for America in her hour of need.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray quality is great, and looks fantastic on a big-screen TV.  I suppose it was too much to hope for that this one would be available in 3D.  Nonetheless, home theater enthusiasts will appreciate the uniform high quality of this production.<br /><br />There is very little not to like about this one.  This is a rousing story of the US Marines in the Pacific.  Highly recommended.  RJB.
0061730335|5.0|It happens very rarely that we come across someone who is truly a genius. Someone who can literally make something out of nothing, who can grow the beanstalk from the beans, who can pull the phoenix out of the ashes, who can harness the wind. William Kamkawmba is one such person. Originally from a small village in the country of Malawi, he turned the shortages and poverty in his life into opportunities for growth and invention. In his book about these experiences, The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, written by Kamkawmba and Bryan Mealer, readers are able to understand the true exceptionality of his mind, witnessing in detail as he builds a radio station out of spare radio parts, a windmill out of junkyard scraps, and equips his house with electricity out of a bale of copper wire. The story goes beyond the inspirational to the truly incredible. A boy who has nearly died from famine and who must drop out of school because his family cannot afford the fees goes on to study at one of the most prestigious universities in the world.    He is able to examine a situation, evaluate what isn't working, what's missing and then what is required to get his desired result. All of these factors which make Kamkawmba a successful inventor now beg the question of how we can facilitate these traits in our students. As with many things in life, it becomes easier to inspire in others that which we have already developed in ourselves. Certainly we can take a page out of his book in terms of the level of enthusiasm and creativity that we bring to our own jobs. As teachers, most of us face numerous challenges in how to reach our students, how to mediate between \\"instructional objectives\\" and our students needs and competing for attention with everything else going on in our students' lives. We can certainly learn from Kamkawmba's unwillingness to take no for answer. Or rather, when one method was not getting him to his goal, he found another path around us. When we can remember that this is apossibility for all professions, not only inventors, we will see significantly greater accomplishments in our work. As teachers certainly not every day will be the triumphal first connection of the electricity from the windmill, however, through determination and courage in the face of criticism, we find that the delayed gratification of persistence will shine through in ways we may never have expected.
140003180X|5.0|This book is a gem, an absolutely perfect addition to a nearly perfect series.  You find yourself really interested in the characters and situations, even the minor and mundane.  And you come to love Botswana and her people.  As one reviewer said, you want to take your next vacation to this understated and totally charming little country.  I purchased the book for my Kindle, then came back to purchase two more in paperback to pass around to my friends.  They have also fallen in love with Mma Ramotswe, Mma Makutsi, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and all the other wonderful people who inhabit this book and the others in the series.  One friend immediately purchased the whole series and is into the third book already.  A word of warning, actually two:  be prepared to stay up late, reluctant to put the book down.  And, if your tastes run to car chases, fist fights, and explosions, look elsewhere.
0061730335|5.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is the story of a remarkable young man, William Kamkwambe, who sets out to help his family and community take control of their lives.  Set in Malawi, a country plagued with poverty, a lack of infrastructure, and corruption, the story chronicles William's journey toward envisioning and then realizing his dream of building a windmill--something not found in Malawi.  Although he faces obstacles, including famine, the inability to continue his secondary education, and the lack of proper tools and parts, William perseveres by using his innate curiosity and his critical and creative thinking skills.     While it's possible to see this story as merely an inspirational piece that could motivate others to work toward achieving their dreams, it is more than that.  As an educator, the lesson I take away is that it is possible for teachers to nurture in their students the same type of curiosity, problem-solving skills, and creativity that William embodies in his life.  He is extraordinary, but all students can achieve their dreams if given the right tools for the job.
B000089770|5.0|How much does smoke weigh?  This is the question that William Hurt ponders as he makes his daily visit to Harvey's cigar shop.  He speaks in such understated eloquence that you find yourself wanting to scoot in closer to hear his answer.  You're soon swept into the lives of a diverse group of people, each with a compelling story to tell.  The scene where Harvey is showing William his photo album--Harvey would take a picture at the same exact spot at the same exact time of day, everyday--is gut-wrenching when William suddenly comes upon a photo of his wife crossing before the camera.  His wife had died a while back, a loss that Willima had never really healed from, and here she was, alive, walking down the sidewalk, an unwitting subject of one of Harvey's daily photos.  Harvey, (Augie) matter-of-factly tells William that she was in several of his photos.    Perhaps that is an ample metaphor for the remainder of the movie, where each character is show-cased in his own scene, a little piece of their lives being filmed for the rest of us to see.  A remarkable film about ordinary people who have a few extraordinary moments of pain, melancholy, and generosity.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Did you attend a city college?  If you did, you know there are bits and pieces in this series that come straight off the campus!  I haven't regularly watched a sitcom since Seinfeld left the tube--but I can't miss this one.  This series will try almost anything and yet maintain the emotional core of each character.  It's hilarious.  Abed will grow on you.  The wisdom he finds in television is awesome!  And wisely insane, of course.  Try it!

B003Y58CKS|5.0|Diana Damrau is amazing!  Amazing that she can act so well and still sing.  Amazing that she can sing so well and still act!  Juan Diego Florez and Zeljko Lucic are also superb as the duke and Rigoletto.  But Damrau is the main attraction.  You'll never find a version as well sung and acted.  A slight caveat regarding euro-trash costumes but these can be rationalized as appropriate for the court revels.  Visually and dramatically my favorite is still the Ponnelle film with Luciano Pavarotti, Ingvar Wixell, and Edita Gruberova. But for a live production, I like this one best.
B0041CGP02|5.0|I was gladly surprised to see that oldies such as \\"Runaway\\" were included. The new songs are really good. It's worth the buy, specially if you're a BJ fan.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Persuasion was the only Jane Austen novel that I had yet to read, and I had not read the book before I'd happened to see this production on Masterpiece theater on PBS.  Since I had not read the book, nor had seen the 1995 version with Amanda Root I really had nothing to compare it to.     The novel follows the story of Anne Elliot, the daughter of a rather, poor baronet who has completely mismanaged his money since the death of his wife.  Mr Elliot is a very interesting character, he is so self-important and snobbish and provides alot of comic entertainment throughout the novel.  When the movie opens, Anne is arranging for their home to be let out while the family moves to Bath in order to try and save some money.  Anne learns that the family coming to stay in their home is the sister of the man she fell in love with years ago who asked her to marry him but whom she eventually turned, down because at the time she was persuaded that he had no money to really offer her.  From this point Anne and Captain Frederick Wentworth eventually meet and we get to watch and see if the couple can ever move forward from the past and find their way back to each other. I really liked it then, I thought the way it was filmed with allowing us personal glimpses into Sally Hawkins's thoughts and feelings created a unique relationship between her and the audience. I thought that Rupert Penry-Jones was an excellent Captain Frederick Wentworth, extremely handsome, cold and still hurt by Anne Elliot's decision despite the fact that time has moved on. I also loved the film locations and cotumes.  Lyme is so beautiful and those scenes are really classic.    After seeing this movie, I purchased the book to read and found myself a bit disappointed with the movie version.  Though I still think that the casting of Sally Hawkins and Captain Wentworth was excellent and I do believe that they portrayed their parts accurately, I was a little saddened by the way the movie ends.  It is completely different from the book and even though before I'd read the book I liked it, now I know that the original ending is much better.  It is so dramatic and much more emotional, especially for Austen.  It makes the ending of the movie, with Anne running through the streets of Bath seem rather stupid and silly. I really wish they had kept to the original ending, I think it would have been a much better version.

I don't know whether people are over analysing, or had overly high expectations or whether it's the tall poppy syndrome but I just thought this was a very entertaining read which will appeal to the mainstream reader both male & female. It's a mystery murder with rape, sex, fraud, romance and many other elements. I will definitely be reading the next book \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\".
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Joe Satriani has proved himself time and time again. This is another excellent album chock full of instant hits. I heard of \\"Satch\\" by listening to Steve Vai's music and have actually grown to enjoy Joe Satriani's style even more. Do yourself a favor and get this album.

Its possible I got a bad one but got this mostly for the USB connection everything else was a bonus. The mixer minus the FX engine and USB connection is a damn good deal fortunately there is model like this minus the FX engine and USB connection so if your looking for a good phantom power mixer you can't beat Behringer. Like I said I needed something with USB capabilities.
B0043A0PXU|3.0|I could have never believed Annie Lennox's voice could ever sound bad, but it does on multiple tracks on this album. Her voice, either as a sign of her age, or terrible mixing, is sometimes off pitch or off key. Some of the music arrangements are too high for her voice, and the pacing often too forced, and too fast. Only on the tracks where the tempo slows and she can sing at a lower pitch, does she sound more in tune. Other artists have recorded \\"historic\\" or \\"madrigal\\" Christmas albums without sounding this strident and harsh. Update: I am editing this review slightly. I have increased it from two stars to three stars. 24 hours after my original review, I have made myself listen to the entire CD twice more, and it is growing on me a little. If only all the tracks were as good as \\"Universal Child.\\" I love all kinds and styles of music, but I am disappointed in the uneveness of this album's quality. Please listen to some tracks before you buy. Make your own decision about if you like it. It is my own fault for not doing so.
B00428CPUY|5.0|I really like the DVD .It has a vast cast of characters playing everything from solid body electric guitars to nylon string classical guitar(Earl Klugh).Eric does the best version of Bob Marley's\\"I Shot The Sheriff\\" that I've ever heard.The flippin jewel case broke after only being opened a couple of times.These double DVD cases are terrible!
B0044XV3QY|1.0|I enjoyed the original version, so upgrading was a no brainer.  However, I have now had two different sets of this DVD, and both exhibit huge problems in playback of the extended version of the DVD (with the extra 16 minutes).  I like to think I have pretty much state of the art home theater equipment, including the LG BD590, with all upgrades, and both sets I have had to date exhibit a terrible habit of jumping, sometimes several whole chapters.  This does not appear to be a random issue, because when I go back and try to replay the same material, it jumps exactly the same way.  In watching the Collector's Extended Version on the first set, I watched the 3 hour movie in just 2 hours because of the jumps.  I returned the first set to Amazon, who promptly sent a second set.  The second set does the same way.  I tried to play it on a different blu ray DVD player, and the disc menu did not even load!  I sure this is a great product, but it sure would be nice to have a set that plays correctly and doesn't skip around.  I have dozens of blu ray DVD's in my collection, and I never have experienced this sort of problem.  I definitely think there is something wrong with the quality control of the DVD's, hence the single star.
0446195529|1.0|I've never thought of Baldacci as a great writer or even an expecially good one. His dialog has never been better than average, but his plots held my attention and I've read each one.<br /><br />So what happened with this one?<br />Did he not have an editor? Or did he use a bad ghostwriter?<br />The last 50 pages were action packed and I thought (at last) he's with us again. A lot of action, but it was totaly, totally incredulous.

B000687M48|3.0|This album could be great if only the crowd had shut up while Evanescence was Rockin', Instead you get more crowd noise than anything.  I believe that the editors of this CD could have improved this problem, Now I will have to figure out if I can screen out some of the roar.  I don't know that I can do it, but I'll try in order to hear the live versions of these songs.
0393078299|5.0|Of all the hundreds of books I have read, \\"Quantum\\" is truly the best! The history of the quantum era is captured in wonderfully rich detail and all of quantum mechanics' historical, personal, and scientific achievements come to life under the skillful writing of Manjit Kumar.<br /> I was introduced to this book by a friend who has the audio version. Right from the beginning of my listening adventure, I knew I had to obtain the book itself....which I did....from Amazon.com. I wanted the best, so I ordered the hardcover edition. I plan on reading this again, to my kids.<br /> You do not have to be interested in quantum mechanics or physics to enjoy this book....it has all the elements of a historical masterpiece. I can find no fault in any of it.<br /> Like a great work of art, \\"Quantum\\" will sweep you off your feet. Immediately immersing you in a world where few have been, and fewer still travel, Manjit brings it home for all of us.<br /> Interwoven in the historical details of quantum physics' explosive beginnings, lies the personalities of some of the greatest scientists this world has seen to date. And it's a rare book that is historical in nature, but reads like a best-selling novel. I am truly impressed.<br /> After it arrived in the mail, I literally could not put \\"Quantum\\" down...until it was read from cover to cover....and I had already listened to the Audible version!<br />Needless to say, I recommend this book to anyone, regardless of what type of book you are drawn to, \\"Quantum\\" has it all.<br /> Do yourself and your family a favor...buy the hardcover so it will last a lifetime...and without doubt, it will make a wonderful family heirloom. It would also make a great gift! -reviewed by Alan
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Wonderfully innovative movie. If you don't like your entertainment requiring you to think, then you won't like it. For the rest of us, it's a winner.
076790592X|5.0|I felt as if I was sitting in the comfort of Morrie's home, surrounded by friends. Although you are not truly included in the dialogue, Mitch and Morrie make you feel engaged, as if you are a part of their talks. Morrie was Mitch's old professor but it's long after the final bell rang and Morrie has never stopped teaching. He continued to teach life lessons, like the idea that we all need to \\"love each other or die.\\" Even while battling ALS, Morrie continues to teach and he never loses his special touch. This is an interesting and worth-while memoir that demonstrates some of life's greatest lessons. By reading this we learn to love the people in our lives, and appreciate the small things. Tuesdays With Morrie has left a lasting impression on me, and I highly suggest you read it so it can do the same for you.
B002ZG974M|5.0|This movie is so much more than a cute home-video of babies.  It's anthropological genius.  It presents an unbiased view of candid moments in the children's lives, much more like a nature documentary than a movie about people.  For example, there is no narration or introduction.  We're just thrown into these children's lives much the way they are themselves thrown into the world and must cope and adapt.  Secondly, there are no subtitles, so when the subjects speak you have no idea what is being said unless you're happen to understand their language.  Though you realize pretty quickly we don't need to speak the language to understand exactly what is going on.      I found this film so intriguing I began wishing for Babies 2, Babies 3, etc, to introduce me to child rearing in other parts of the world.  Or even to contrast babies within the same country but who live in varied settings; city baby and country baby.      My toddler loves watching this movie and knows all the babies by name and delights in narrating their actions for me whenever we watch it.  It is a thrill, I suspect, for her to see and comprehend the very simple basics that she herself has just mastered.  I bought her the DVD for Christmas.    In short, an excellent movie that I don't mind watching over and over and over (as is the life with toddlers).  Watch and enjoy.
B0007Q6PBK|1.0|I had this on video- I recorded this when it originally aired- always loved it. I never had the complete opera though. But the sound was Excellent. In THIS DVD the SOUND STINKS. So much so that i find it Un-listenable. I suppose if you've never heard this with \\"good\\" sound you might like it- still- It just loses everything. HORRIBLE TRANSFER. Strange sound that detracts from everything. Trust me.
0385342047|3.0|Obviously for Becky, compulsive shopping is like drug addiction. No matter how many times she learns her lessons, she can't stop lusting after the oddest things.  While there's nothing amusing about addictive behavior in real life, as fiction it can be funny -- up to a point.     I guess anyone who reads these novels can forgive Becky for the compulsive shopping because that's the main point of the book.  If you couldn't forgive it you wouldn't pick up a sequel. Where it becomes unforgivable - and where the concept becomes incomprehensible -- is Becky's compulsive lying which gets progressively worse, book after book. Basically she's become a character who, if she is talking, she is lying. And that's not funny.    The oddest thing. As I read this book, what bothered me more was not the fictional Becky, but the writer herself.  How she could think that a character who lies as Becky does could ever be considered a good friend, a good daughter, a good wife.  She states on her author's notes that she herself is not a compulsive shopper. But a book reveals a lot about the writer herself. How can she reconcile the deception in her main character, a far worse flaw than shopping and one that the writer doesn't seem to address much at all.    Compulsive shopping yes, I can find it funny. I'd find it a lot more funny if she just lusts and juggles what to purchase, rather than constantly getting herself hugely in debt.  To me it's the obsessing and the arcane objects themselves that are amusing, rather than the buying itself.  But the lying really needs to stop. If the author doesn't find it in her character to object to it -- which is odd -a lot of her readers do.  I'd like to hear from the writer as to why she keeps writing her character as more of a compulsive liar than a compulsive shopper.
0307473473|5.0|It has great characters, terrific writing (and that's in translation) and an unsurpassed plot. What more could you want. I'm here just to add my voice to the crowd in love with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, hoping my five nudge the overall rating at least to four stars.<br /><br />Anyone reading this: Have no doubt. It's fantastic!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I like country music, pop and anything else I like. Josh does not seem to fit any of these styles of music but has some universal appeal that I find hard to explain. Josh has a fantastic voice which is matched to songs that bring out the best in his vocal interpretation of both words and music. I have no trouble listening to songs sung in a foreign language when Josh sings them. My wife used Josh to help her study for exams and she came top in her class. The passion in his singing made my wife concentrate and inspired her to work harder. Illuminations is another vehicle sent to delight the ear. I love it.
1554072840|3.0|This book has great pictures and a good story, but my 21 month old was fascinated with the \\"uh oh\\" page.  She completely understood that an accident could be outside of the potty and proceeded to have on purpose \\"uh ohs\\" like the book said.  Day 3 we only read one potty book with no accidents and now on day 5, we have had two accident free days.  I think an older toddler would understand more that it is saying accidents are okay if they happen, but my toddler sees things in black & white so it was no good for us.
B004FDY4LE|1.0|The show's good, but when we missed an episode, we made the mistake of downloading this episode from Amazon. 31 minutes? Try an hour and a half (at least...we're still waiting).
B004EBMVGC|5.0|I only get books on Audio now.  My eyes have problems.  So you could say I am an expert on audiobook productions.  This surpasses all expectations.  They have multiple readers, male and female to help with the characters changes in gender as well as some of the best audio actors I have ever heard.  I got this out of the library first - now I am purchasing it.  Wonderful book & series (don't forget to read the accompaning Shadow Series - you could read them at the same time Enders Game first, then Enders Shadow, etc.  Wikipedia has the Chronological list - both series are gripping and very moving.  Great story telling by Orson Scott Card!
B0048ZJOP0|4.0|I have been a Mariah fan forever, but \\"breathy\\" Mimi doesn't do it for me. Well, let me say, it works for some songs, but I defniitely prefer the Mariah that uses her pipes. Anyway, the Merry Christmas album from the 90s is in my Top 10 for Christmas albums, and I listen to it over and over and even out of season. The sound and the songs never get old. I was excited for this album bc I was hoping for more of the same. This album is OK. It's a mix of Mariah and breathy Mimi. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not completely up to the standard she set in the 90s. My favorite song is O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus. I am traditional when it comes to Christmas music, I love love love that she's done a song w/her mother. Her mom has a beautiful voice. I saw them together on the special and it was wonderful. This song is what I expect from Mariah and it's the sound from the pre-Butterfly albums. MC really sounded into the song. O Holy Night is on here as well and so are a couple others from the first MC album. All I Want For Christmas Is You is present as well, but the original is a better version.     As I said, I watched the ABC a few nights ago, and I think that's when this was recorded...at least some of the songs. It's a decent album and is worth a buy.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Some of the best lighting and visuals I have ever seen in a movie. It comes alive on the screen and you can even smell the markets as you watch. I am a very visual person and even without the story the scenes took me in. I love old classic scenes.<br /><br />The story was also brilliant. I liked how I could get into the roles and I kept listening to my voice inside tell the actors - no, no, no. Not many movies make me talk to actors as they did when I was a child.<br /><br />25 - 1 ratings - so read these as well to ultimately decide - but if you like something non-Hollywood then simply order this.
B003O85W3A|1.0|I hate to be too harsh on an album like this because, fundamentally, it's good music.   The writing is excellent and the music is fine.    The problem is that it arrives with great hype and the album lacks an id, unless you are referring to tepid & insipid.   It has no heart or soul.  None of the songs build up or out or do much of anything.   It lacks any hint of range - veering only between elevator music and what they might play at the library if the library started playing music.     Ultimately, great music has to have an edge.   Look at the legends - people like Lennon and Cobain - even in a whisper they screamed.   This album uses a inside voice from end to end, and slips from the mind immediately after you turn it off.   It's good, if you can consider music good thats neither powerful or moving or even the least bit exciting at any point.       This is only a success as a concept album about the suburbs - in that it achieves the banal monotony and conformity to perfection.
030726999X|5.0|This book was in mint condition. We had read the other two books in the series \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl who played with fire\\" and loved them, so we just had to get the third one. We were not disappointed. I think anyone who reads them has GOT to start with the first one to understand and get familiar with the characters. Full of action, very well written, keeps you in suspense all through.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This group shows an excellent musicality in an album that blends an Alternative Rock feel with an updated Folk sound.  Excellent instrumentation (how often do you hear a stomp board these days?), great musicality, and the ability to produce some excellent harmonies mean that Mumford and Sons excels at conveying the entire range of human emotions to the audience.     While Little Lion Man is the song you'll hear on the radio, this is one of the few albums that I love to listen to in its entirety.  Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.
B003UESJGK|5.0|I love Anne Hathaway, that movie its great awesome movie for an adult audience.. but also very true great job...
B000077VR3|5.0|The ratings here remind me of the movie \\"what the bleep do we know?\\" as there are a huge number of 5 and 1 ratings. This to me spells great success. It is not just a few 1's, but hundreds - so there is a formula here for a very unique movie that you will either love or hate statistically speaking.<br /><br />So here is your guideline. If you like things like American Sweetheart, Narnia, or Harry Potter (the Hollywood Like Hits) and your taste stops there - don't order this.<br /><br />This is a movie goers movie. This is a musical, a movie with song and a unique approach to cinema. If you or your friends are serious photographers or into video you will love the quality of this. If you do like the unique approach - try \\"what the bleep do we know?\\" as well, see below.<br /><br />Happy viewing<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0006UEVQ8 What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]
B00192IV9U|1.0|15 seconds into this album and I already went \\"Ugh!\\". Akon croons, \\"Akon and Emjayyyyy\\". Yechh!! Who does that?!!!    This whole album sucks because:    1. It lacks polish. It sounded like someone singing in the basement. The Cascio basement.    2. Some parts were clearly not MJ. You can hear when Michael's clear, violin-like voice cuts in. Jason Malachi's voice is like grainy sandpaper, lacks power and he bleats like a sheep. Did I mention he also hee-hee's like a horse? How blasphemous to attribute this hideosity to Michael Jackson!    3. The songs don't flow together. Only Michael can arrange his albums right.    4. There is no theme to this album, no cohesion. It's a mish-mash, a hodge-podge.    5. There are only 9 new (not really) songs on the album. Cheat$$$! \\"The Way You Love Me\\" is recycled and remixed all wrong. Why did Teddy Riley feel the need to digitally alter the pitch of Michael's voice on an already beautiful song into something quite awful? You can't improve on perfection, I'm sorry.    6. This is not even one single hit song. Well, obviously, that's why Michael rejected them! He would never put B-sides on his albums. And now, an entire album of B-sides and demos! *Michael rolls over in grave.* His albums always had multiple hits because he only put in the best, never any mediocre songs. While some of the songs here were genuinely nice, none of them were mixed right or produced to Michael's level of perfection, thus making the whole experience thoroughly un-enjoyable. Hence no hits.    This is so not the work of the master. I don't want anymore new albums, I'm sticking to the real gems (pre-2009).
B00433TO52|5.0|I think Shakespeare is an inspiration. The fact that after so many hundreds of years, people still relish his work and still find amazing beauty, mystery and wonder in his words shows what a amazing genius he was.<br /><br />I often wonder about today's literature and if it can possibly stand the test of time the way Shakespeare's has. And I seriously doubt it.<br /><br />What I think is most amazing is that whenever a new medium tp publish arrives, Shakespeare is still one of the first writers to be showcased. And rightly so!<br /><br />As for the collection, I can't really fault it. My favorites are there and its really nice that the publisher has collected not only the traditional, but these apocryphal plays. It immediately drew me to it. I have already read one of the new plays and it was fascinating from many different perspectives. I can't wait to read the others, although I am trying to pace myself.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie is fantasic! My husband and I went to see it in theaters and could not wait until it came out on DVD/Blu Ray. Pay attention throughout the entire movie and I think you will enjoy it too.

B0040JHXTI|2.0|I am listenin' to Dylan's Bootleg Vol 9 - the demos done on a low fi reel to reel for Witmark.  They are brilliant and have all the magic of a major young artist exploring and growing and thriving and glowing.  Kudos to Bob for putting out his music \\"warts and all\\" as the Dead have said.    There is perfection in the imperfection and in the magic of creation.    Bruce should just put the demos out and let us see and marvel at his process.  He is older now, rich and secure.  I go to his concerts, but he no longer is hungry.    Nothing compares with youthful discovery and rawness of growth.  He canot recreate the 1970's....    I wish he trusted his genius the way Dylan does his own.  We need documentation not recreations.    I listedned to tunes when previewed on  All Songs Considered web site, but have not yet bought this.  Pity.
B004AUGJS8|2.0|If you're looking for a suspenseful movie, don't look here. The acting is good, but there is no suspense because it's slow character driven drama that is base on murder that doesn't unfolds until the very end of the movie.
B001IF252C|1.0|I tried this on multiple displays with multiple notebooks. Same thing. Works great for 2-3min, then the screen starts going intermittently black. Lines appear across the display. Eventually, it totally dies and the screen stays black. After reading the reviews, I bought one at Best Buy which allowed me an easy return. I thought I might get lucky. Oh well.
B000002MP2|5.0|I had to buy this CD because Green Day is a band I grew up listening to. I remember seeing them before the American Idiot album when their sound was more punk rock rather than their currently emo punk rock. Great CD!
0547258305|2.0|This book is based on an intriguing concept. The first part of the book contained the best writing. I was completely in the character's mind for the first 20 minutes. After that, I kept on reading, but honestly was surprised by the cheesiness and convenience of the romance, as well as the amazing amount of forced coincidences -- so many that my relatively elastic suspense of disbelief snapped.    Halfway through the book, I decided to look up the author's bio. Sure enough, when you read the author's outlook on herself as \\"fiercely independent\\" you realize that the female protagonist is simply a hollow mouth-piece for the author's disillusioned perspective on feminism, sexuality, independence, love and relationships.    I'm a 25 year old girl, so this book should have been right up my alley. It wasn't. However, the best thing to take away from this book is its ability to open up discussions. Since it's targeted at young people, there are plenty of opportunities for them to explore the themes propelled in this book and decide if they think the conclusions and consequences are realistic (NOT, IMHO), as well as if the reasons behind the main characters' decisions were legitimate (I'd call them short-sighted and selfish).     Not every book has to be perfect or morally sound, but it should have some level of reality. This one did not in my opinion. Everything was too easy for the characters and the sacrifices made were pretty boring. The romance just happened in a bland and blatant way, not too mention CHEESY. What should have been the climax of the story was pretty anti-climactic. What could have been a fascinating concept was put on the back-burner to the author's agenda. Too bad. I'd been looking forward to reading this book for months since I'd read the reviews.
1846553482|3.0|\\"Comparisons are odorous,\\" Shakespeare's Dogberry notes in Much Ado About Nothing. It is not the author's fault that he has odiously been compared to Stieg Larsson. A British reviewer simply couldn't come up with anything incisive, so \\"the next Stieg Larsson\\" had to substitute for informed comment.<br /><br />The idea that all Scan writers are the same is demeaning. The hype over Nesbo fails to do measured justice to his talents, as he is basically not being judged by the same standards as top thriller writers, rather getting extra credit for being Norwegian.<br /><br />Anyone who reads these books in Norwegian will see how much better they are than in English. The translator does not so much make mistakes as he drags the diction down to his own Daily Mail, yobbo level of grammar and dialect.<br /><br />Nesbo's derivative novels are nowhere near the genius of Larsson's Millennium series. Not that he himself has ever claimed they were. It is generous of Michael Connelly to so trumpet an upcoming writer. Connelly is unquestionably one of the greats. But, oddly, he was less excited at the time by Larsson:<br />  \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a striking novel. Just when I was<br />  thinking  there wasn't anything new on the horizon, along comes Stieg<br />  Larsson with this wonderfully unique story. I was completely absorbed.\\"<br /><br />I cannot say I am completely absorbed in the Harry Hole series, after reading them all to date. Certainly above average. But I don't see much new here. If you know Harry Bosch, Wallander, alcoholic detectives and mavericks in the force ... ad nauseum, I don't think you will be as overwhelmed with five star hysteria as the regular cast of \\"oh gee, oh my\\" Amazon reviewers appears to be.<br />But then I did not get sent free copies.<br /><br />I recommend indeed trying out one of Nesbo's books. Make up your own mind.
0763644765|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old son adores this book. The whimsical drawings and limited text inspire us to fill in the story with the terms that we use at home. We have several of Patricelli's books, and this one is just as great as the others. The last page with the \\"undies\\" has especially helped with some of his unease about big boy underwear. We haven't started training yet, but I hope this book is a good companion. I definitely recommend this gender-neutral book as an addition to any toddler's library.
B004BSEKH6|5.0|Nicki proved all the haters wrong in this intense debut album. The radio hits \\"Your Love\\", \\"Right Thru Me\\" and \\"Check On It\\" are on the CD. The shockers are hits like \\"Dear Old Nicki\\", \\"Blazin\\" with Kanye West; Nicki holds her own against a Hip Hop great, \\"Save Me\\", \\"I'm the Best\\", \\"Romans Revenge\\" with Eminem, \\"Super Bass\\", \\" Blow Your Mind; crazy rock beat....I may have named almost all the songs but this is No Skip Record....ENJOY!!

B0038W0OIK|4.0|Great headset, had it for a few days now and sounds so much better than the Logitech G930 that I'm returning to Amazon.  Sound is very crisp and sounds great while playing World of Warcraft, make sure to set it to 8Ch to get the best sound while gaming.  Music and Youtube also sound great when in use. Would highly recommend this headset to anyone who wants a great experience while gaming.  Out of the newer lines of headsets I've used the World of Warcraft USB headset, and the Logitech G930 wireless headset and the Steelseries 7H is the superior in my opinion.  Will update this review if needed in the future.    ***Update 8/26/11    So I had the right side of my headsets speaker die out on me, sound stopped working completely.  Contacted Steelseries and got an RMA, new headset arrives.  Plug it in, same issue right side isn't working.  But if you tilt your head to the right like a dog it works fine. obviously a short.  Not impressed with steelseries sending me a broken replacement headset.    ***Update 8/31/11    Now on my 2nd replacement headset, comes in the mail today but again same problem as stated above, is steelseries just sending broken reburbished headsets around until customers get sick of dealing with the returns? This makes broken headset #3. Needless to say, my Steelseries has lost a customer as I will never be purchasing another item from them after having 3 of the same 7H Headsets fail. Terribad!    ***Update 9/8/2011    So, After exchanging my headset and going back and forth with support, they finally managed to get me a new 7H USB and some Bonus for the inconvenience; I must say after being pretty upset with all this going back and forth and paying all these shipping charges I am impressed with the service that Steelseries rep J.W. gave me. Really helped as much as he could, and apparently went above and beyond with a little bonus. I retract my statement about Steelseries losing a customer, they just won me back thanks to J.W. If I could meet this man in person I'd shake his hand.  Attention Steelseries: John W. is a HUGE! Benefit to your team. He just won you a customer back for future business.
B004G6009K|5.0|I guess this 5 stars because after seeing it and watching other movies there is just nothing that seems to top this one! It's like what other movie can I watch that will top this one.    I going to get the DVD when it comes out I guess on April 12, 2011    Seen it 2 times in the movies and going to see it at lest one more time in the movies.    The voices are very good and the video is so good. The story is I guess what makes it so very good. It's neat to see Rapunzel get out of her tower for the 1ST time. That every thing is new and she is so excited. Like going to the kingdom for the first time her facial expression with her body too are grate. Disney did a super job on this movie!    I thought I would not like this because it's got a lot of music in it. But if this one did not have the music it would not be as good. The music is so good in this movie. It goes right with it.    Even got some books and a poster of this movie. I never did that for any other one.    You can see some video clips one the web in HD too that Disney put up.    It looks like they draw this and had a computer help them. So the video looks super good.    I love this movie.    I hope this DVD will come with lots of extras. Some clips on the Internet are not in the movie.    -Raymond Day
B004498KPU|5.0|I think having this total collection of Michael's mini movies was a great idea and I love it.  Despite what one person stated that the quality of the videos was not high quality it not correct in my opinion.  The quality was excellent and clear.  I think only a true fan of MJ would see the value of this collection even if they have every dvd ever released of Michael's  music as I do.
B0044XUZ9K|5.0|Loved the book. The illustrations were good and really helped the story along. I enjoyed their punctuation throughout the book.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I have been a Trekkie since the  1960's. I admit I did not think anything could compare to what Gene Roddenberry did back then, but this movie was great.  My favorite part about the series was the relationships between Spock, Kirk, and Bones.  This movie version honors the \\"specialness\\" of their relationships.  I saw it in the theater and had to own it--it was sooo much fun!
0446677450|5.0|WHAT HAPPENED TO FATHER?       Some of us are old enough to remember the television situation comedy fathers of the 1950s and 1960s. They were iconic figures, wise and loving. Ward Cleaver, Jim Anderson and Any Griffith. Who wouldn't have loved to have a father like that? Whatever happened to that father role? Today they have been replaced by Al Bundy, Home Simpson and Ray Barrone. What happened?  The answer to this question can be found in the challenges to father in the real-life role of breadwinner and patriarch, to the vehicle of humor which loves to bring down the \\"big guy\\" and to the popularity of shows that feature socially-inept fathers.       While no longer the single source of income for the family in real life, this is reflected in a fall from the pedestal for the television father. Men can still provide for their families, but not always at the idealistic, professional level that early television sitcoms portrayed. This makes it easier to cast the TV father in a demeaning light to extract humor.       Bringing down the \\"Big Guy\\" is a staple of American humor. The authority figure in society -  the Banker, the School Principal, the Boss, are invariably portrayed as male in situation comedies. We laugh with delight as they are frustrated, mocked or removed from that position of authority. And so it is with the portrayal of fathers. The easiest joke on television today is the inept father.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.  Russel Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey of he British Navy in the 1800's.  Britain is at war with the French.  His mission is to hunt down and capture/destroy a French raider known as the Acheron.  What he doesn't know is that Acheron is far superior to his and that its mission is to destroy him and his ship.    A terrific story that will have you mesmerized.  Great acting by Crowe and his cast.  Great visuals and special effects.  However, what sets this movie apart is the attention to detail. You really get a feel for what life was like on these wooden vessels and the challenges they faced. Incredible amount of attention to seamanship, crew interaction, how and what they ate, morale, and how superstitions sometimes guided their actions.  It's an awesome movie to watch.
B003KGBISY|4.0|This is a comment on the Blu-ray release. I wish Amazon would separate DVD from Blu!<br />The picture transfer for this release is exceptional. I wish I could say the same for the subtitles!<br />Even on the main film the subtitles are ordinary and frequently odd words cannot be read because of the background. Sometimes they are not on screen long enough to read. In the extras disc it gets worse, much worse. The first discussion is terrible with barely 20% easily read. Thin spidery titles displayed across blue and white check shirts as an example are impossible to read! In the long interview it is better but with just a little thought it could have been so much better. No thought at all seems to have been given to font, color, strength and duration on screen. In the third doco and in the trailers we are back to the bottom again. As all the dialogue is in Japanese it is essential to have good subtitles and Criterion have made a real mess of it, spoiling the whole release. It baffles me how they could be so careless. Did anyone actually sit through these extras before the disc was finalised? If so they must have been Japanese speaking or asleep! The odd Japanese subtitles that appear are excellent with wide font and stronger color. Why Criterion could not get the message baffles me. This second disc is a disgrace and should be reissued. Someone in their QC department owes their customers an explanation. I would rate these subtitles as amongst the very worst I have ever seen on Blu-ray and even on DVD they would be regarded as terrible. I will give 4 stars for the main film but only 2 for the extras as they can hardly be understood in parts and great concentration is needed to work out what might have beed said! What a shame.

B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is the one of the few films I know of to humanize the embarrassment of stuttering. It tells the story of Prince Albert, Duke of York, who, following the death of his father and the resignation of his older brother, became King George VI and had the unenviable task of leading England and its many colonies into World War II; although he had a voice and had plenty to say, his debilitating stammer made it virtually impossible to actually say it. Imagine what that must be like. You're a public figure, your country is on the brink of war, and the frightened masses long for your words to comfort and guide them - but you have not yet mastered the skill of getting those words out. Your mouth gets in the way of your brain, and what's worse, it's at a time when it's most inconvenient.    There's a moment late in the film when Albert, known to his family as Bertie (Colin Firth), watches newsreel footage of Adolph Hitler addressing the Nazis: \\"What is he saying?\\" asks one of his daughters. \\"I don't know,\\" he answers slowly and deliberately, \\"but ... he seems to be saying it rather well.\\" When the film begins, it's 1925, and Bertie fails miserably at delivering a speech to close the British Empire Exhibition; from that, it's easy to understand his frustration, dread, and shame, knowing he was teased as a child, knowing his nanny favored his brother, knowing his father's inability to comprehend, knowing every single certified speech therapist in London failed to relieve him of his stutter. So then it's understandable that he would eventually admire Hitler's speaking voice. He was an evil man, but boy, when he spoke, his voice rang loud and clear.    Bertie's story begins when he was still a Duke. In the mid 1930s, desperate to get her husband help, the future Queen Mother Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) happens upon Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech therapist and failed actor from Australia who loves performing Shakespeare in front of his family - in alllikelihood because of the flowing, eloquent language. He's not like the other speech therapists. He makes the rules. He insists that he and his clients be treated equally, which is why he addresses the Duke as Bertie rather than Your Highness. He wants to be called Lionel, not Doctor. He demands that all sessions be held not in Bertie's estate, but in his own office, which, in its dinginess, takes on an oddly organic quality that suits his profession. He's witty and isn't afraid to show it, not even in front of royalty. Elizabeth, while unaccustomed to eccentric commoners, is willing to comply for the sake of her husband.    And so begins Bertie's speech therapy, an unconventional routine of diaphragm exercises, tongue and jaw techniques, and memorization of tongue twisters. But this is not merely a clinical series of activities; over time, a friendship grows between the two, one that enables Bertie to try a little harder, even in desperate situations. When he puts on headphones and listens to music, for example, he's able to recite a Shakespeare soliloquy without stammering. How is this possible? It's a matter of distraction; with his attention focused away from the fact that he's speaking, he can go from start to finish almost completely unhindered.    But how can he speak with any degree of confidence knowing the crown would soon be on his head? He never wanted to be king; he was a naval officer and a prince. Following the death of his father, George V (Michael Gambon), the next in line for the throne was his brother, Edward (Guy Pearce), but he abdicated in order to be with the woman he loved - a twice divorced American socialite named Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). Elizabeth sensed this in Edward, which is why she sought out Lionel in the first place. If her husband was to be king, and if this meant addressing the people on a regular basis, it would be necessary for him to treat his stammer and conquer his fear of public speaking. Everything leads up to the fall of1939, at which point Bertie, as George VI, must announce over the radio that England is at war with Germany.    Firth's portrayal is extraordinary. Watching him, we don't see a prince or a king; we see a man who wants to be heard. We may also marvel at his ability to stutter, which isn't at all easy to mimic convincingly. Credit also to Carter, who lends a quiet but nonetheless wonderful air of caring and sympathy to her role. On the basis of this portrayal, it's no wonder that the Queen Mother was one of the most beloved royal figures of the last century. And as for Rush, he finds the right balance between humor and heart in his depiction of Lionel. He may crack a few too many jokes, but he is a person with feelings, and it's clear that he cares deeply for his wife and children. \\"The King's Speech\\" is an absorbing, touching, inspirational film, and is definitely one of the year's best. Its only flaw is its R rating, which the MPAA deemed necessary for exactly two scenes of swearing. I don't pretend to understand what goes into making these decisions.
0142428272|5.0|John Lee's voice is on numerous audios and he also has an extensive acting background, lending high drama and interest to Ken Follett's drama, the first novel in The Century Trilogy. Here five inter-related families move through the first world war, Russian Revolution, and women's rights in lives that become entwined. A complex, involving inter-generational read evolves.
0439023521|5.0|I actually listened to this book on Audible.  One of very few books that kept me engaged in the car in my driveway just listening.  I probably would have classified the book as science fiction or post-apocalyptic, but I was later told that if it has a teenage love triangle, then it's young-adult.  Regardless, I found the book engaging, albeit a bit dark and violent as the premise of the book is about a death match between children.  Highly recommend.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|I don't understand why the DVDs for this season cost $60, while you can buy the whole season as digital downloads for $10 ($13 in HD). Why the complete disconnect in pricing?
B002P6TA94|5.0|I came to really like Wolfmother, after buying their self titled album on whim one day.. I really liked the song 'Woman', and I liked what I heard when I sampled the other tracks... but when I popped it in my cd player in my car after buying it - I was blown away - absolutely BLOWN AWAY.. I was instantly hooked with the crunchy and catchy guitar riffs and Andrew Stockdale's 'Plant-esque' vocals..    Cosmic Egg - while not only sounding like an awesome name for a rock album, expounds on everything great with their self titled album.. Usually on every album, there is at least 1 or 2 songs I will skip by - or 1 or 2 songs that I feel should be omitted from the album, because they sound like filler.. that is not the case with this album. This deluxe version is 16 tracks of pure heaven juice..    If your of the belief that rock today isn't the same - that it lacks the same feel, sound, and soul of it's predecessors - I would highly recommend this album, and band to you... It's Zeppelin, Sabbath and Hendrix all rolled into one.

0439023513|5.0|First, I'm surprised that 20% of readers posted negative reviews about the final book.  It seems most of the negative reviews were because it didn't end the way they wanted the book to end, or because they may have disagreed with the intended message.  For me, I just enjoyed listening to it every day, and I wasn't going to stop until I got to the end.  I've started plenty of books, where I eventually lost interest, and it got thrown back on my bookshelf.  This last book in the series was not one of them.  I agree that the world she paints was unexpected in many ways, but it was still compelling, and made for an enjoyable read.  Although most of the book was dark, the ending was satisfying and hopeful enough for me.  I highly recommend the whole series.
1596680296|5.0|Since I like smaller projects that are completed before I get bored, socks seemed the perfect \\"new\\" project for me. After looking at every \\"learn to knit socks\\" book I could get my hands on, I chose \\"Getting Started Knitting Socks\\" because it is a beginners guide that uses double pointed needles exclusively.      Double pointed needles had always both attracted and intimidated me. Not anymore! This book is absolutely amazing.  The instructions are simple, clear, and well illustrated.  My first pair knit up without a hitch and they fit perfectly. I am absolutely loving using DPN's and absolutely loving knitting socks.

0439023491|5.0|The second book in the series was just as engaging as the first.  I thought it was a great build up on the theme of rebellion.  This book more than others spent a little too much time for my taste on the \\"which boy do I choose\\" dilemma, but I guess there are probably readers that enjoy that kind of conflict.  With that said, the book was full of action and kept you wanting to get to the end.  Highly recommend.
0307010856|5.0|Yes, I had to buy two of these.  I thought my four-year-old nephew would love it.  Unfortunately, my daughter found out and I had to get her one, too.  I really didn't mind but it does seem like a 20-something daughter could just read her cousin's book every now and then.  =)
B002ZG980U|1.0|I heard so many people talk about how great this movie was, so I bought it. This is the most boring, meaningless, chaotic movie I have seen in a long time. I am stunned how bad it is. I now have serious doubts about my friends tastes.

It has been a while since I have worked with polymer clay, so I got this book to help me brush up on some of the techniques that have gathered cobwebs in the recesses of my brain.<br /><br />This book is a comprehensive, easy to follow, step by step with clear illustrations guide to using polymer clay to make lifelike figures. The author gives so many invaluable tips and tricks that I was completely giddy. She evens guides you through how to make your own custom tool set. She makes everything so attainable for any skill level.<br /><br />If you are interested in this topic, I can not recommend this book enough.
B001HN694K|1.0|Horrific CGI mixed with a drab storyline/story and sub-par acting on almost all fronts made this movie nearly unwatchable, considering the foundation it stemmed from. Granted the art direction was nice and I enjoyed the Church Mouse and the March Hare, though not enough to ever bother watching it again. That being said, if you're looking for this on Amazon, you've likely already seen the film and liked it, otherwise you would just rent it. But if you haven't... please, don't bother. Go get Burtons' Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish instead, something with heart and genuine storytelling.

The Testament and The Chamber are my other strong recomendations from Grisham.<br /><br />I was blown away by the ending. Very thought provoking, it took me by surprise. I was kinda upset that I didn't see it coming. Good job!
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I don't know why you're all complaining about the packaging. If you take good care of your dvd's and have a shelf/cabinet for them (since you bought this boxset I'm assuming you're somewhat of an avid movie-buyer), there's absolutely no way of the movies becoming defective or abused. Maybe you should all quit complaining and be satisfied with what Pixar created. I've never seen anything like this boxset. It's a solid idea and executed wonderfully.    Now go sit down, watch Toy Story 1-3, and relive your childhood.
B00335EQ3Q|5.0|I have a couple of movies on my shelf that I turn to when I need to just have fun and turn around a bad day.  Strictly Ballroom is one of those movies.  It's very tongue in cheek funny and the dance sequences are great fun to watch.  The story is pretty predictable - sort of an Ugly Duckling/Cinderella story done on the ballroom dance floor.  There are some sequences that are done quite seriously and I think are amazing.  The scene when Scott first meets Fran's family and learns how to truly dance the Paso Doble is one of my favorites.  Paul Mercurio is so sexy during those scenes - sort of like an Australian Patrick Swayze.  There's also a scene when Scott and Fran are dancing alone backstage at a dance competition that is so sweet and tender. The message of the movie is \\"A life lived in fear is only half lived.\\"  Scott and Fran both want to live and dance without fear but they have family, friends and Australian Dance Federation President Barry Fife attempting to stand in their way.  Who will prevail in the end?  I'll bet you can guess.  There's so much to love about this movie.  There's great music, extravagant ballroom dancing costumes, humor, romance and a good message.  I love it!
B00003CXB4|3.0|This is a great movie. I received it quickly in the mail. However, this is the platinum edition with two DVD'S. One does not work at all. Luckily, it was the one with the extra scenes and behind the scenes video.  The other video that contains the movie works fine.  I will keep it.  I guess that's what happens when you buy \\"used\\" merchandise.
0307719774|4.0|I have started a couple of these 5 year journals, and I liked this one because it gives you direction for your thoughts. It will also definitely be interesting to see what changes from year to year. I like the freedom to interpret these questions the way I want, and also to be pithy should the mood strike.<br /><br />This is a small time commitment to make and I think the payoff down the road will be great.<br /><br />My only complaint - and I am not sure how this would be fixed without a spiral binding, which I would not like - is that the binding is a little tight (for lack of a better word) and it can make it a bit difficult to write when you are near the center. This is really not a big deal though, as you are only writing a few lines per day. If this were a journal meant for more lengthy entries, it would be a big problem. I have not yet run into the grammatical errors that were spoken of in other reviews, but that may bother me as well.<br /><br />Nice product, overall!
B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|I, among many other people, love Miyazaki's work. In fact I own some of his films. Ponyo, however, is another story. Back in 2007 when I heard on imdb.com and saw a trailer on youtube.com that Miyazaki was in the project of another anime film I thought \\"Awesome! Can't wait to see\\". Seeing the Japanese trailer I thought \\"Cute. Chibi-like anime (I like). Japanese actors seemed great. When's it coming to America?\\"It's been about two years later when John Lasseter (PIXAR/Toy Story) among with other producers and other workers from Disney became affectionately involved in this film when somebody realizes, \\"Hey, you know what? This story is very similar to our Little Mermaid.\\"<br /><br />That's when the American/English actors/actresses were in the project voicing these characters. I honestly believe that the American producers, or whoever is in charge of choosing actors, could have done a better job picking the right actors for these characters, but they feel like since Hannah Montana and The Jonas Brothers came along the same year Ponyo did somebody thought lets get the youngest sister of Hannah Montana and the youngest brother from the Jonas Brothers to be in this film and make a song for the ending credits. How cute.<br /><br />Something tells me that the American producers/agents were on a extreme tight schedule so they thought \\"Cool lets get these two youngsters as the stars - easy money\\". As for the other actors - I don't want to say they did awful 'cause then I be an idiot, but I must say that some (NOT ALL, but some) could've done better. I mean some of the American actors were just sticking out like a sore thumb. It's noticeable and sometimes it can be an eye sore. I mean compared to Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle they actually, in my opinion, had actors Americans knew which one was best for each role. Heck, I never would have thought Billy Bob Thornton and Jada Pinkett Smith would be in an anime, but I think they did well.<br /><br />Story - like I mentioned, Ponyo is like Miyazaki's version of The Little Mermaid. Is this good or bad? I'll explain - Like the story it begins under the sea (lol), but instead of a castle it starts with what looks like a boat with fins. Ironically the father of Ponyo, Fujimoto, hates humans, yet he's driving a boat that can submerge and float. How hypocritical. So escaping, Ponyo encounters a five-year-old boy named Sosuke and the two of them become the start of the story. Their friendship leads the townspeople in jeopardy when the town experiences heavy rainstorms, tsunamis, and floods, so the two of them must journey on a small boat Ponyo magically bloated from Sosuke's toy boat. They search to find Sosuke's mother (Lisa), who watches the local senior citizens. So far so good. They finally find land and walk when they find Lisa's car leaving Sosoke helpless, which cuts to the next scene. At the bottom of the new sea (Thanks to the flood) the local senior citizens are fine and walking like their young again. Lisa talks to Ponyo's mother, which I'm assuming tells her everything what's going on. So Fujimoto arrives to tell Sosuke that everything's going to be alright and leads to the finale of the story where Ponyo and her mother agree that she wants to stay with Sosuke. Finally the ending settles with Ponyo, as a fish, bounces in the air and lands perfectly safe on Soskue's lips, giving a kiss at the ending. So I'm suppose to assume that these two are destined to be in love for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />All I can say is that overall this movie is half-and-half (Good and bad). It's like the first half of the film had a great star, encounter, and chemistry with the characters and with story, but all of that kind of backfires the audience leaving them with questions about most things occurring in the story. I think what bothers me the most are the American producers who felt like to me that they did it quick just to get it over with to get on with their other projects. Some of the American actors weren't so great. In fact why would there be pre-teen actors portraying a five-year-old boy and girl. That's what gets me. The musical score by Joe Hisaishi was fantastic. I love nearly all of his work. The animation was also great. Similar animation styles from his early works like My Neighbor Totoro. Finally the ending of the story felt awkward and not entirely fulfilling. I hope I haven't upset any anime fans or anybody else. I'm just speaking what I felt about this movie. Again I love Miyazaki, but this movie wasn't that great.ican actors weren't so great. In fact why would there be pre-teen actors portraying a five-year-old boy and girl. That's what gets me.

B002ZG98UK|4.0|This is response to William Merrill's review, if in fact you have played the latest major installment of the Resident Evil game franchise(which would be Resident Evil 5) you would know that the fight between Chris Redfield/Alice/Claire Redfield against Albert Wesker in the movie was based loosely but not too dramatically different from Resident Evil 5's flashback sequence where Chris redfields remembers himself and Jill Valentine fighting Wesker. And in that sequence Wesker fights exactly the same, with Matrix style fast moves in which they slow down the camera to catch all the action and suspense of the fight. SO technically the movie wasnt exactly copying the signature Matrix Bullet-time technique, the game had and the movie took that element for the same purpose. Just to clear that up...onto the review...Resident Evil: Afterlife was an awesome 3D movie experience(for those who were lucky enough to catch the movie in all its 3D format glory)...it was well worth the price of admission to see this movie in 3D...it definitely took the Resident Evil franchise to new heights with its 3D action including fights ane zombies and all that gory jazz...Being an avid fan of Resident Evil games then movies and Zombie movie's in general I truly enjoyed this movie experience(and can't wait for the next installment)..though with all that said, like every sequel, it did have its flaws...mostly just in the flow of the movie...long drawn out flight sequences kept this movie from my 5 star rating but other than that make sure you catch this movie in its 3D format(the way the movie was meant to be released...  ~JP~
1599219751|3.0|*Note that this review contains spoilers*<br />Having read an above-average number of books about the Russian Gulag, I began this one with optimistic skepticism. The first part, in which the author recounts his capture, arrest, interrogation, trial (such as it was), transport to prison, and life in camp, sounds more similar than different to what I've read before. Unfortunately, that's where the credibility ends. Soon, the camp commandant's wife is: discussing escape with a prisoner, fashioning provision bags for prospective escapees, and informing the autobiographer of the date her husband will be away to increase his escape party's chance of success. Additionally, the guys planning the getaway all easily relocate to the same living quarters without arousing an ounce of suspicion. The escape goes off without a hitch, as if the camp is completely unguarded, and the men, no doubt emaciated (after surviving several months on a 400-500g bread ration), weak and cold, ford a large river and continue on, traveling 30 miles a day through the snow in Siberia. They survive thirteen days without water in the desert, traverse the foothills of the Himalayas with nothing more than a rope, and even spy a couple of eight-foot tall abominable snowmen. When it's all said and done, the survivors conveniently go their separate ways, never to see each other again.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that The Long Walk is fiction, the writing is pretty good and the story is, incredibility aside, entertaining. My advice, though, is to skip this book and spend your time (and money) on the real thing. Infinitely better: Coming Out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life by Victor Herman (get it in unabridged audio format or not at all), 11 Years in Soviet Prison Camps by Elinor Lipper and Man is Wolf to Man by Janusz Bardach.

B00192IV9U|1.0|Sorry, it is nice to hear Michael's voice, but I can't buy this until they make a follow-up disc that includes all the untouched demos as well.     The Way That You Love Me is the only song I can enjoy for what it is, because we have an original demo of it from years ago that was released that you can compare this version to and enjoy both.     All the other songs on the album you can't enjoy because you question why they mixed the songs the way that they did ie. Hold My Hand, Another Day, and Much Too Soon leaked versions sounded WAYYYY better than they do on the album versions, so far all fans I have talked to agree. Like why did McClain add an annoying accordian to Much Too Soon to drown out Michael's voice which is the magic of the song? Why did Akon over-complicate the bridge in the song when the leak was perfect? Why did McClain add that cheesy John Tesh / Kenny G / Baker Street / saxophone to Behind The Mask accompanying a live crowd?     Then Hollywood Tonight is good, but it is annoying to hear Taryll Jackson's voice on it after he slammed the album and people who worked on the album publicly, and Taryll and Teddy Riley making idiots of themselves on Twitter trading insults over the album.    Then there is the album cover that seems to show that Sony is embarrassed to show Michael's 2009 face and using his kids, a Prince symbol, and Oprah's face on the cover all which are big \\"no-no's\\" to the hardcore fans.    Lastly, the investigation is still pending on whether this is really Michael on 3 of the songs which I'm not convinced that it is him. But you know what? Give me all the fake songs you want, but just give me the originals of the real songs and not some hot-shot producer's interpretations like we hear on this album!    That's all that comes to mind for now. Poor Michael deserves better than this mess. As usual, he's the one who loses... again.
0061990477|5.0|The large Catholic Cleary family is scraping by in New Zealand when Paddy Cleary, the patriarch, is invited by his extremely wealthy and mean older sister to live on her sheep ranch in Australia.  The family jumps at the opportunity to gain security and the promise that they will inherit the property when the sister dies.    From the moment they arrive, the local priest, Ralph de Bricassart, is taken with ten-year-old Meggie, the only girl in the family.  He treats her like a treasured daughter, dotes on her, and as she gets older and older, denies that he is as deeply in love with her as she as with him.    The forbidden love between Meggie and Ralph affects not just the two of them, but the next generation as well, as Meggie tries valiantly to forget the priest and make a life for herself and her children that is happier than her own childhood.    I loved the characters in this novel and the tragic circumstances in which Meggie and Ralph found themselves.  The setting was as fascinating as the characters, and I looked forward to each section that highlighted a different member of this family.

B001GCUO1Q|3.0|The first two XMen movies were great, no doubt about it.  This one was not as good (neither was the third for that matter).  Is rushed over somethings, some of the cinematography was shotty, like they just wanted to get this out and into print.  I will admit, no one does the Wolverine scream like Hugh Jackman, and I don't know who else would look that part.  It was worth the $5 for the special effects, some of the story, the costumes, and having something to watch while I work on costumes.
B003EYVXYG|2.0|Up until Survival of the Dead, I typically watched George Romero's Dead movies with a fanboy-ish fervor. I over-looked the plot holes and down right silliness in Land of the Dead with the smart zombies. I ignored a few of the oddities in Diary of the Dead. I didn't really agree with the whole, \\"We're them\\" stuff in his remake of Night of the Living Dead. His point about consumerism in the original Dawn of the Dead took a backseat to the characters and story, so I never even noticed he was trying to make a point with that one until I listened to the commentary. After all, a large shopping mall is defensible and has everything you need in it, so moving in to one during a zombie apocalypse has very little to do with greed.     The point in the movies is one of, \\"Can't we all just get along?\\" basically. Yes, I'm aware we're at war right now. I'm aware that we're also split politically about how to handle things. But to take those two concepts and toss them in to a zombie movie the way this movie handles it is just tripe. You have two feuding factions fighting about how to handle the zombies. One side thinks we should kill all zombies. The other wants to train zombies to behave.     Okay, everyone remember the good old days when treating zombies like they were the humans they used to be got you eaten? It happened in Night of the Living Dead when the parents were protecting their infected daughter right up until she ate her mom. It happened in Dawn of the Dead when the woman at the beginning of the movie ran up to her dead husband and he bit a chunk out of her arm. I'm sure there's cases in Day of the Dead and possibly Diary of the Dead, but I haven't seen them as much to remember.     So, flash forward to Romero's latest, and he has a faction trying to teach zombies to eat animals. It's kind of like Romero saw one of the Chic-fil-a \\"Eet mor chiken\\" advertisements and took it to heart. I'm pretty sure zombies, once they learn to eat live animals, will still probably enjoythe delicious taste of live humans. It's just.. bad.
0316044695|5.0|The Book starts out good and just keeps getting better to the end. The book is some what like a mini biography of the authors up bringing joining the navy and how he got in seals and then the action that unfolded with the 4 navy seals (american Heros) in the moutians and the authors survival. There isnt much else i have to say but if you havent got the book your missing out.    The only down side...his voicing of politics is redundant.. i didnt have a problem with it but i could see how it would bother some people (just look past it) and he is has arrogant pride that shows in the book like most texans (i didnt mind that either im from texas)    For all the trash talkers that gave it a bad review....you guys are idiots...or jealous of seals..    Regardless the book is a must!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Every time I come home from work or school feeling crappy i just blast this in my ears and don't feel so alone. every song on this album is relatable. its not like all that rihanna/lady gaga stuff that no one can relate to. these guys are the real deal. Rock On!
0670021652|5.0|I read 'Eat, Pray, Love' and thought that was the best I had ever read (you can see my review of it for more details).  And then I read 'Committed' and it is THE most amazing book EVER.  It is so insightful, truly a life-changing book that you will love reading (not like a self-help book).  I don't usually write things that make me sound like a crazy, fanatic person, but this book left me awe-struck.  I learned so much about myself by learning with Elizabeth.  And her wonderful humor still shines through.    Any woman over the age of 20 who has ever been, is, or hopes to be in love MUST read this book. It is THE best book I have EVER read. You will find yourself, your sister, you mother in these pages. It is truly incredible. If you are single or with someone, lesbian or straight, religious or not, do not miss this book. (Guys, it might not hurt for you to read it, too, if you have a 'modern' woman in your life.)
B0043A0PXU|1.0|Have been a fan a long long time. Sometimes disappointed with her solo releases which seem to be uneven in both the music and creativity. This cd, however, should never have been released. It almost sounds like she has lost her fabulous voice........unti the very last song which seems to be original material (I think). Universal Child her last piece on this cd is the Annie Lennox that sends one in another time and space. Her voice on this sounds like perfection. The rest of the cd seems like she is just going thru the motions. Nothing like Dylan's Christmas cd of last year. I give it one star it only has one hit for me.    D.Angerame
B0032JTV6U|5.0|As the description brought out, it was the performance of \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" that initially got me hooked, but the first episode that I had witnessed was the one with Kurt joining the football team. When I watch this show it reminds of me of when I was in high school and how you felt the need to belong. In this show you have a bunch oh kids that think they don't belong anywhere, that is until a teacher with a passion for singing takes over the Glee club. It's a humorous/emotional ride as you see these kids try to find their way in school, thus getting them prepared for the world. One character that I LOVE is Sue Sylvester, yes she is one of the shows main antagonist, but when you actually listen to her, she at times makes a lot of sense. Her comebacks are evil but genius, things you would've never thought you would hear, but she says them and she says them proudly. I have to say that one thing I do not agree about the show is that Rachel (a very talented singer) is always and I mean ALWAYS put to for-front. It's a known fact that she's talented, but it seems that every episode, she is getting some record breaking solo and for me it's irritating. Sometimes they lose me when they constantly show her in the spotlight, but some do get special solos when they're alone. Like Kurt's \\"Rose's Turn\\" beautiful and Mercedes' \\"Beautiful\\". But I think an absolute favorite of mine would be their version of \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\", that song has always been a favorite of mine, so when I heard it I thought that it was executed perfectally. Glee is a must for those have always wanted to do something but found themselves a little to scared or shy to actually do. It's a show that helps you express yourself. It's a show that I hope will continue for a little while longer.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|I starting listening to Springsteen in the middle of his career and it was his work call Darkness on the Edge of Town, that captivated me. Since then I have been a fan. I enjoy his solo music and the darkness that often blankets them, like Nebraska, Ghost of Tom Joad. This really exposes the soul of Springsteen since many of the songs were re worked and released commercially. It shows me the creative growth and evolution of his music.  Truly an amazing experience listening to this four times in a row. This release totally surpasses my expectations.    Dominic A, San Francico
B000LB7G00|5.0|I purchased the 3Dconnexion Space Navigator on the advice of a co-worker and a Mac-Sketchup user forum.  It seems the high powered Mac that I have has a particular issue with a particular software which I use extensively.  It is a 3D modeling software, Google Sketchup, and while in the program I would attempt to pan/zoom/rotate, etc., tasks performed often while designing in 3D, my normally high powered Mac would grind to a slow crawl.  After reading on the Internet, via a Mac user forum regarding Sketchup, the moderator suggested using a 3D mouse to eliminate or help my problem.  I purchase one(3Dconnexion's Space Navigator) and true to its claims, was a plug and play setup.  Sketchup recognized the Space Navigator immediately and I could pan, zoom, rotate, tilt to my hearts content without any slowdown in processing speed.  The Space Navigator is extremely sensitive and does its thing with just the slightest of touches.  As I use it more and more it has become almost just a thought I have and it happens on screen.  The unit is heavy and sits where you place it with no movement about the desk surface.  I also tried it out with Google Earth and it is like flying, making you airsick if you move too fast.  Although it does take some skill to keep from crashing.  It makes the images move seamlessly through 3D space.  I now cannot imagine not having this wonderful little tool.  It also allows my right hand to continue to use my wireless mouse to change commands, so now you are working with both hands and having a ball!  I don't know if this works with gaming software, since I am not a gamer, but I would imagine if it did it would be fantastic.  3Dconnexion does have on their website all of the software programs which will respond to this magical device so check it out.  Sketchup users, this is the cat's pajamas!

B000AP04OM|5.0|This wonderful classical film from 1965 in bright colours and with excellent sound quality is a treat you'll cherish for a long time, whether you know the story already or it's new to you. You'll find Maria (Julie Andrews) and the Van Trapp family charming and endearing. If you like musicals, this is a MUST have in your collection. It's timeless and inspiring, and suitable for the whole family.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|Another installment in the Resident Evil movie set, and it is well worth the watch, mainly for the action and special effects. As for the plot? What plot? The story basically continues where Alice (Jovovich){a past employee of the Umbrella Corp - a company that did questionable secret bio research}, continues on her journey in search of persons who have not been infected by the deadly, or should I say, the undeadly 'T' virus. After an inital blast of action, with clones of Alice and all, the picture slows down a bit.<br /><br />The film goes into a cool adventure mode with Alice flying across the US to the city of Los Angeles. Her ultimate goal is to find Arcadia (a safe haven). Eventually they lock down in a prison facility, until the undead realise that they are there and then the action starts again.<br /><br />Action scenes seem to be borrowed from the Matrix (but who cares, that film started a whole new realm of cinematics):<br /><br />- Fighting in 'rain' against first zombie boss with an over-sized axe;<br />- Main boss has an Agent Smith type of feel, dark shades and all, there was also the extensive use of the bullet time effects.<br />- the 'wire work' isn't too shabby either.<br /><br />Not a bad action film, with hard driving music to keep the momentum going.
B003WTE886|4.0|Good Cd, get it and read her lyrics. It's all lowercase letters, but there  are random uppercase letters.. put those uppercase letters together, its gives you some sort of clue or hint or whatever LOL, of who the song is about... Im probably late :) but I just realized it.
B003N5VOUO|3.0|Rating: PG-13<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />This film is about a gentleman named: Rizwan Khan (Shahrukh Khan). He is a muslim from the Borivali area of Mumbai, India. He suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a form of high-functioning autism. This syndrome affects the way that he relates to the world and those around him. On the positive side, he can solve word puzzles and remember large portions of texts, word for word easily.<br /><br />On the negative side, this syndrome causes him to get confused easily and he repeats certain phases continually, which can cause persons to misunderstand him. He regularly makes it a point to make sure that his surname is pronounced correctly.<br />Eventually he meets a single hindu mother and manages to woo her to marry him.<br /><br />Plot Points:<br /><br />This film attempts to probe into the difficulties experienced by minorities, here are the different minority areas that are covered:<br /><br />- persons with disabilities<br />- immigrant groups<br />- religious groups<br />- mixed religions in marriage<br />- racial minorities<br /><br />Their lives are quite turbulent at points as they are severely misunderstood and their son is viciously persecuted.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />While this film may seem far fetched at points, and a bit self serving and overdone, it brings to the forefront many issues that some persons within our society face everyday. The objective of this film in my opinion is to raise the bar of tolerance that we have for our fellow human being.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is Michael Ceras greatest film ever! The action and visual effects are amazing. I have not read the books but from what I have heard is the movie is nearly exactly the same to the books with only a few minor differences but it works with the movie. I will recommend this to any one who is into fighting type movies or video games.
B003VYAVGA|5.0|It's taken Robbie Williams 14 years to patch things up with the pop music entity called Take That, and bury the hatchet with Gary Barlow, the band's premiere songwriter and lead singer back in the 90's. The duet song Shame, which saw Robbie and Gary singing personal messages to each other, and was Robbie's last solo single before rejoining the band, was also a prelude to Progress. If Shame was in any way an indication that the newly reformed boy-turned-men band would be all about ballads, then that's where they misled the fans.    Progress, true to it's name, is surprisingly a sophisticated pop album, an instant classic if you may, loaded with psychedelic pop, electronic experimentations, collaborations from the entire group, Gary's vocals popping up here and there with a few verses, and finishing off the record on lead vocals with the infectious Eight Letters, a song written by Robbie Williams about his sudden exit from Take That in 1995, and other songs about youth, politics, revolutions, and Take That.     And it comes as no surprise that Robbie is dominant on most of the tracks. After all, he is the only major international superstar within the group, and hasn't been on the last 2 Take That albums. The second most dominant on the album is surprisingly not Gary, but Mark Owen who, since penning the UK number 1 hit Shine, has become a major contributor.     The album opens with first single The Flood, a song about Take That with Robbie and Gary sharing lead vocals, which starts off with Robbie singing \\"Standing on the edge of forever, at the start of whatever, shouting love at the world\\", before the song gets even more incredible with Gary singing the bridge leading into the song's soaring chorus with all 5 members harmonizing like they've never done before \\"although, no one understood, we were holding back the flood...they said we'd never dance again\\" SOS, a Mark Owen and Robbie Williams duet, is another top notch tune which is the most early-Take That sounding track on the album. Wait, a song that Robbie must have left off of his electronic album Rudebox, fits in well, tinged with references to the bad blood that developed between the bandmembers in the mid 90's, \\"Wait, there's something that I wanna say, something that we hid away, something I would like to change\\" Kidz, one of my favorites, is Mark Owen's psychedelic pop epic, with Gary crooning the chorus about kids coming out and causing trouble. Pretty Things is possibly one of Robbie Williams's greatest ballads, with touches of Angels and She's the One. Happy Now is an upbeat electronic Robbie Williams/Gary Barlow lead track. Affirmation is Howard Donald's classy house/electronic song. Underground Machine is Robbie Williams's rock edged sequel to Let Me Entertain You and Man Machine. What Do You Want From Me, one of the highlights on the album, is Mark Owen's deeply personal, somewhat optimistic yet angry, message to his ex-wife, with some biting lyrics like 'I still wanna have sex with you, I still wanna go out with you' The album comes full circle with Eight Letters, another personal message written by Robbie but sung by Gary to the rest of the band, which in my opinion is Take That's most enduring song they've made since Back for Good, and will definitely become the band's concert-closing anthem during their upcoming tour, \\"we became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned, expendable soldiers smiling at anything\\", on his feelngs when he left the band, \\"and when I went away, what I forgot to say, was all I had to say, eight letters, three words, one meaning\\", and looking back at what happened from a different perspective \\"you can look back but don't stare, maybe I can love you out of there\\" Finally, there's the hidden track, Flowerbed, Jason's brilliant guitar-laden ballad, to close up the album on a sweet note.

B0043A0PXU|1.0|I hated it. HATED it. Despite the fact that most of the songs are old time favs of mine. (And I don't even want to know WTF she/they thought they were doing on Lullay Lullay, a LULLABY which has been a fav fav *tender* CALMING song in the past: I withstood not quite 10 seconds of it before I had to shut it off, it hurt my ears so badly and made my blood pressure go up.  What happened to the voice that sang \\"Into The West\\" from the Lord of the Rings trilogy ending? Nowhere to be heard: the Lennnox on this Xmas cd sounds like she's either been chain-smoking non-stop for the past week, or screaming for a few hours. I felt like doing both after wasting $13 on this cd on a whim at the checkout counter at Whole Foods today.
B001DCN178|4.0|I am happy with everything except the velocity of keys (which I assume is because of half action only). However there are 3 different settings (soft / hard / fixed) so this is not a major problem.   Size is perfect and quality/price ration are excellent!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This may not be the world's best backpack for photography equipment, but it is an inexpensive mode of carrying your equipment around when you don't need to haul your whole studio around. It is light weight, has sufficient support at shoulders, and at waist.  Has enough room to carry one SLR/DSLR, couple of lenses, long and short, spare batteries,flash cards, flash, and other accessories.  The inside space is customizable to adjust for your needs.  It is light weight. It helps when you don't have to carry the weight of backpack in addition to your equipment. It would help, although, if it had a little more padding for support, and a anti-weather waterproof cover for protection of the equipment.

0061730335|5.0|William Kamkwamba's story contains many examples of preserving in face of tremendous obstacles. William's story is a refreshing reminder of how trivial most of my problems really are.  Reading the story, it humbled me to think of how many blessings my family takes for granted everyday. Throughout The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind I was touched by how William rebounded from each obstacle with a selfless and solution-oriented attitude.  Teaching lessons that I learned from William's attitude include: instilling a love of learning, entrepreneurial spirit, and  the ability to dream big.  William's passion for learning and discovery led him to teach himself physics and electrical engineering. Due to financial hardship, he was unable to attend school however he self-taught and learned how radios operated.  Later, he discovered how to harness wind power and store it using simple materials which he salvaged.  I would like to still this attitude in my students by encouraging them to set high expectations for themselvesWilliam's passion for learning and discovery inspires me to conduct my own teaching research and to step outside of my comfort zone.  William's entrepreneurial spirit did not wait for others to provide for him. However, many ridiculed him for wanting something that others viewed as impossible.  Some accused him of being a madman for hoarding garbage and even after it was completed he was accused of witchcraft.  William did not allow the criticism and skeptics to discourage him, instead, the criticism motivated him to finish his goal.  He visualized the completed windmill, the praise he would receive, and the much needed second harvest that his project would bring whenever he felt discouraged. Where many people would see hopelessness, he was able to dream and more importantly, bring his dream to fruition.
0399536108|5.0|This book isn't about any radical sort of nonconformity in terms of metaphysical worldview, political orientation, or lifestyle.  Instead, it's more about being self-employed, growing personally, appreciating the world's diversity, spending time in a fulfilling way, and making a social contribution.  In other words, fairly standard stuff, although particularly applicable to people getting ready to make significant changes in their lives.<br /><br />Doing all of these things surely requires personal qualities, but it also requires favorable circumstances such as good health, freedom from having to care for others who are highly dependent on you, ability to handle the physical rigors of travel, and having the opportunities associated with being based in a relatively affluent and secure country.  On the one hand, I'm tempted to be critical of this book because the author has these favorable circumstances (in his early thirties, healthy, married but no kids, etc.), and I sometimes got the sense that, due to not having many adult years under his belt, he doesn't fully appreciate the extent to which others are held back by lacking one or more of these elements.  On the other hand, I found that he's still able to offer a lot of useful insights and advice, some of which were new to me.  The following is my summary of the key points I found most noteworthy:<br /><br />(1) The central message of the book, which warrants repetition, is: \\"You don't have to live your life the way other people expect you to.\\"<br /><br />(2) Life planning is about designing the perfect day, as well as looking at the longer term.  In other words, find a balance between structuring your time and allowing for spontaneity, and remember that both the journey and goals are comparably important.  Related to this, \\"... we tend to overestimate what we can complete in a single day, and underestimate what we can complete over longer periods of time.\\"<br /><br />(3) To make life changes, you have to be open to new ideas, dissatisfied with the status quo, willing to question authority, willing to be unorthodox, able to ignore naysayers and gatekeepers, willing to take responsibility, willing to work hard for a long time (~10,000 hours), generally courageous, and accepting of unexpected consequences.  And of course, if you want to escape your current situation, you need to first know where you want to escape to.<br /><br />(4) Since we tend to regret more what we didn't do rather than did, when on the fence, it's better to do things rather than not. In other words, if you have a bad feeling about something, say no; if you're excited but slightly intimidated, say yes.<br /><br />(5) We're often held back more by fears and insecurities rather than circumstances.  Fear of change is one of the most common fears.  Ways to transcend fear include having a bias towards action and mentally envisioning and coming to terms with the worst-case scenario.  Moreover, remember that surviving major crises tends to make you stronger.<br /><br />(6) Saving and investing for the future is fine, but shouldn't be used as an excuse for excessively deferring what you want to do now.  Spend money on things you value, including experiences, and avoid other low-value spending.  To increase savings, emphasize increasing income rather than cutting expenses.  And even if you choose to work toward financial independence (savings equal to about 25 times annual expenses), don't plan to retire.<br /><br />(7) The best security is your own competence, and self-directed learning is sometimes the most efficient path to expertise.  Success often follows a pattern of exponential growth, but you have to get the process going by getting the initial elements in order.  Related to this, measure the value of your work in output, not hours spent.<br /><br />(8) The tension between helping yourself versus others is perhaps best resolved by finding a balance.  \\"The price of greatness is responsibility,\\" and leadershipis about influence.  At the same time, helping yourself develops capabilities which can be used to help others.<br /><br />(9) Drawing on Joseph Campbell, perhaps most people are seeking the experience of being alive rather than a meaning for their lives.  Either way, think about what you can offer the world that no one else can, and don't apologize for pursuing big ideas and dreams.  That means that, while good work is fine, great work is revolutionary.  In order to undertake a major project, on the scale of creating a legacy, recognize that you'll also have to give up some things.  To free up time for the things that matter, eliminate unnecessary obligations, activities, and even people from your life.<br /><br />(10) If you do succeed in a big way, after you've basked in the glory of your achievement for a while, move on and find ways to build on it.  Consider thinking of every day as the first day of the rest of your life.<br /><br />(11) The bottom line: don't \\"go to your grave with your song still in you.\\"ilities which can be used to help others.

0738711500|5.0|I really like this tarot deck and the book that goes together with it!!! I'm not a professional at all when it comes to tarot readings, but I really would like to learn. The deck itself is really colorful and all the pictures help you to read the card, rather just be pretty... you intuitively can tell what the card is about when you look at it and try to read the meaning just from what you see. When you read the book for explanation on each card, it becomes even clearer. The book is easy to read and you can actually understand all the meanings from the first reading, which is not always the case with book about tarot.I highly recommend this set to everyone that is in the beginning stages of learning about tarot and tarot reading, and for the seasoned readers - this is an absolutely beautiful deck!!
030746363X|5.0|I just got the book in yesterday and dug right in.  Tim makes it very clear, that the reader should NOT read it cover to cover.  It is a reference guide. Go to the thing that you want to change and dig in.  I love the fact that it has the \\"geeky\\" stuff grey boxed.  If you want to get the results, just do it... if you want some additional food for thought (read that as intense mental stimuli) then dig into the grey boxed stuff.    The thing is, a lot of people are looking for a quick and EASY fix and I have yet to see that in the book.  Everything I have read so far (I read through the sleep improvement section and the M.E.D. concept for muscle gain), is about the QUICKER part... but that does not mean easier.  Want to sleep like a log?  Try the ice bath.  I actually have done this in the past (well a variant... I did the polar bear plunge into 30 degree ocean water for 2 minutes)... and the result was probably the best sleep I ever got, when I went to bed about 2 hours later.  It worked, it was quick... but it was NOT easy.    If you are looking for an out-of-the box compilation of short cuts, then GET THIS BOOK. If you are looking for an EASY, no effort required solution, then you may have to wait until hell freezes over.    - Mike Michalowicz, Author of [[ASIN:0981808204 The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur: The tell-it-like-it-is guide to cleaning up in business, even if you are at the end of your roll.]]

B001P9EQH8|1.0|So,  I bought this very dubious device to improve the tonal quality of my Sony NWZ-5545 / Bose NC headphones; boy was I out of luck. I charged the device up as instructed. I then placed it in-line with the headphones and tried very hard to detect the difference in sound quality with the FiiO and without. To my dismay there wasn't any :).  So, for any of you folks looking for a stocking stuffer, please keep looking, at least it didn't diminish the sound quality, but it certainly has no business advertising itself as a headphone amp.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I feel a little deflated after reading The Hunger Games.  Perhaps it was all the reviews gushing about this being the best book they've ever read, or thought provoking, or emotionally engaging that built this up to a point it couldn't possibly live up to.  Or the opposite reviews going on and on about the brutality and graphic violence.  Again, I don't quite get it.  Perhaps the only books these others read are fairy tales with happy endings because I didn't find it even close to the most violent, brutal, or graphic book I've ever read.  Certainly nothing most people, the YA audience included, haven't already read or seen on television or in movies or video games.    Don't get me wrong, it was okay.  It wasn't a bad read.  But it's certainly not the most engaging book I've ever read.  I had trouble relating to the main character so I never really felt like I was engaged in the story.  I found Peeta and Rue much more relatable.  I liked it enough that I will probably read the sequels, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.  Maybe I would have given it more than 3 stars if I hadn't read all the glowing reviews first - but I did and frankly, I expected more.
B00192IV9U|2.0|I expected much better.  I doubt MJ would have allowed this album to be released if he were alive. It is so NOT up to his standards.  He's probably spinning in his grave.     I also suspect that if MJ had wanted these songs released, they would have been released.      I suggest you just buy a few songs off the album, not the whole thing.  Hold my Hand is a great song and video, but it's incomprehensible that there is so little of MJ in both works...     There is one song (forget which one) which really does not sound like Michael Jackson's voice.  I can see where the controversy comes from.  No way is that voice recognizable as MJ.      The Michael Jackson estate is turning the artist into a brand and to hell with quality as long as they rake in the money.      Michael Jackson had magic -- the people who put this album together don't.

0061730335|5.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind provides a wonderful reminder of how obstacles can sometimes ultimately contribute to success.  Giving voice to this personal story, William Kambwamba tells of life growing up in a rural African village where poverty and hunger are such predictable aspects of life that the local language includes a word for \\"the hungry season.\\"  For Western readers who have only viewed African famine from the impersonal vantage point of their television screen, William gives us an opportunity to relate personally to the experience by sharing his thoughts and feelings.    William's story reminds us how important it is for every child to have access to books and to experience an environment that supports exploration and education.  Every child has the potential to shine and succeed in ways that we couldn't have imagined, and some will lead their families and perhaps their nations out of poverty and into a sustainable and comfortable way of life.

It has certainly stirred a lot of controversy, but I am thankful I get to savor some more of the sound and talent of a great artist - Michael Jackson!

B0041HU440|5.0|Unruly Child has come up with a truly inspired smash hit with their comeback CD \\"worlds Collide\\". Marcie Free's dynamic voice and range really kick in these songs and Bruce Gordy's guitar work is award winning. The whole band is very tight.      It is refreshing to hear some truly melodic rock 'n roll again! From the whistful \\"When We Were Young\\" to the rocking title track \\"Worlds Collide\\" and the song that I feel is the CDs first single \\"Very First Time\\", I will be listening to this album for years to come. I very highly recomend this CD.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Unfortunately the negatives are numerous.      This is basically a redo of WRATH OF KHAN except the target is now Spock instead of Kirk, but we even have the same planet-destroying technology.      The gag reel is more silly than funny.      There are no deleted scenes, always a big minus on a DVD.      Overall the film is a good addition to the TOS universe however if you're looking for a classic, this isn't it.    When it comes to the characterizations, the actors who play McCoy and Scotty are often over-the-top, mainly because of forced dialogue that is cliche for the characters from the original series and dropped in here deliberately so the audience is banged over the head with it.  Also there is often an unnatural quality to their voices because of the tone they are forced into, as if bad stage actors doing impersonations.  However you can be sure they are the comic element to the film, and they are funny, and fortunately this McCoy works nicely with our new Kirk.    The character of Uhura is definitely the worst realized, probably because most writers and directors in Hollywood don't know what to do with a female in a film unless making her an object of desire.  So first it is Kirk who meets her, wants her but gets nowhere, then she later becomes involved with Spock.  Hopefully there will be something more useful for this crewman to do in the next film.  When you compare how she only has a moment to display her expertise in her job, it is very sad when you realize for Sulu and Chekov it is all about their training.  She is so clearly the token female in this film.    The best thing in the film is Chris Pine (with the JFK hairdo) as Kirk, and he and the new Spock are clearly the best things about this film.  They honor the original actors in their portrayals without stomping on the characterizations, having enough physical resemblance to Shatner and Nimoy they easily suggest younger versions.  Especially Pine as Kirk has the right touch of energy, confidence,brashness and charm in his portrayal, however the Spock here is (as mentioned above) a bit out of whack, as if a new Vulcan character were dropped into the mix.  You can see this Kirk is a born leader, no matter what age he is.  The only drawback is the script has him constantly - and comically - on the make with females, which brings to mind other psychological implications in the aspect of \\"doth protest too much.\\"    Let's hope the second film the screenwriters and director are more relaxed and maybe then the actors will really have something to work with.
B0042UFWES|4.0|Most fans of John have this CD already loaded (ok, most likely sans the Yoko songs) into their Ipod.  But the stripped version offers some great options to enjoy these songs.  \\"I'm Losing You\\" is my favorite alt version, dramatically against the lone guitar.  It reminds me of Paul's \\"Feel Like Letting Go\\", in a good way.  \\"Starting Over\\" is a different (better, at least for my taste) song here- the original still featured the doubling (Big Bopper) effect on John's vocal, like a left-over from his last record, \\"Rock-n-Roll\\".  It worked on the original Starting Over, launching it as a smash pop song 30 yrs ago.  But the stripped version is a more personal song to savor.    Take advantage of the free previews, and then buy a few that song interesting.  They are 100 times more polished than the songs from \\"Acoustic\\", but still let you enjoy the soul of these tunes.
B004856SQ8|3.0|Joe Carnahan's (NARC, Smokin' Aces) big screen take on the favorite 80s television show offers a lot of bang, booms, and everything you'd expect to come from, well, to come from an A-Team movie.  Transforming the series into a big-budget action fest finds our four heroes Hannibal (Liam Neeson), Face (Bradley Cooper), B.A. (UFC fighter Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson), and Murdock (District 9's Sharlto Copley) as soldiers who are double-crossed and set-up in Iraq.  Months later, they are re-united after some daring prison breaks, and put in the direction of those who left them disgraced.  For what The A-Team is, it isn't bad.  There are ample amounts of ridiculous action scenes, and the dialogue and interplay between the guys is what really makes the film worthwhile.  Other than that though, there isn't really much here to recommend.  Not to mention the fact that even the theatrical cut of the film feels like it's running way too long, and keeping track of the whole thing may prove more difficult than one may first guess.  Jessica Biel is on board as the ample eye-candy in the form of Face's ex-flame, while Watchmen's Patrick Wilson is here as a smarmy CIA spook.  All in all, The A-Team isn't bad one bit, and it delivers the goods in terms of rousing, flashy action, but the potential for so much more that could have been done with the license by Joe Carnahan just feels like it got wasted.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This extended edition is PACKED with extras. 3 versions of the film on 1 disc! The amount of extras is comparable to the Lord of the Rings extended versions. Comes in a very nice book like case. Definitely a must have for movie lovers!
B003UYUQZW|1.0|I was really excited to get the movie, and I saw some great reviews, but I ordered it about a month ago and it's still not here
0446195529|5.0|It is very disappointing to find that so many people are criticizing the price of the book rather than reviewing the book. Please stop - those of us who are interested in the book don't need a \\"review\\" about the cost.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|Audio and video are crisp. May be too crisp, such that the original low budget nature of the movie becomes distractingly apparent. The machines are obvious movie set models.  The surround effects and some of the gun shots are clearly added post production-they just don't sound natural (the surround effects especially sounded like a 200X remix, compared to the original mono sound mix of this 198X movie). Somehow the higher fidelity actually took me out of the movie. But still a good movie.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|I must say that I did like the action in this film a lot more than the others.  I was thankful that the newborn fight scene was shown because it wasn't in the book.  I am a huge fan of the Twilight Saga and have read the books several times.  However, there were a few scenes in Eclipse that were totally unbelievable and somewhat angering if you know the story well.    First and for most, there is no way in hell the book version of Bella Swan would have hopped on the back of Jacob's motor cycle and rode off with him leaving Edward standing there looking stupid no matter how mad she might have been.  She was upset that he didn't tell her that Victoria was coming for her yes, but she understood that he did it for her own protection.  Edward has always been very overprotective of Bella for obvious reasons.  Powerful entities were seriously out to take away his reason to exist and if that's not understandable, I don't know what is. That's as far as it went.     Bella never wanted to leave Edward's side.  She didn't know what to do with herself when he wasn't around and vice versa.  In the scene with Bella hopping on Jacob's bike, it was Alice whom she gave the slip while Edward was away hunting in the book which made more sense. Whenever she tried to sneak off to see Jacob, it was usually when Edward wasn't there.      I felt that Bella was very insensitive to Edward in the movie Eclipse compared to the book and honestly, I couldn't stand her character.  I almost wished that he would have dumped her because what man should have to put up with such ridiculousness when he and his family go out of their way to protect you and your father night and day? Sometimes, in the pouring rain while you're cozy and comfortable.  Seriously not cool!    Second of all, the scene when Bella breaks her hand punching Jacob was poorly done.  In the book, Bella was extremely angry that he kissed her and almost wanted Edward to hurt Jacob.  She was by no means tried to keep them from fightingin the book.  Edward told him calmly that he'd kill him but it would upset Bella.  She huffed as if it wasn't true and he told her she'd regret it in the morning.  Then he proceeded to threaten Jacob as any man would who is face to face with the man who forced his kiss on his girlfriend. Edward was the one who took the adult and more controlled road much to Bella's disappointment.  If Edward would have grabbed Jacob the way he did in the movie, his arm would have been shattered.  Jacob has the ability to heal, but he is still part human and much more frail than a vampire.    Last but not least, the kissing scene in the forest was horrible also.  Although Edward knew Jacob was listening when he brought up the engagement, Bella and the reader understood why he did it. He'd warned Jacob that he wouldn't play far when it came to fighting for Bella so it was no surprise.  I don't know about anyone else, but I would have done the same thing.  In the movie Edward was made to look like the bad guy for hurting Jacob who honestly deserved it after all the crap he did in the book version. In the book, it was also Edward who was the one who went after Jacob and brought him back to Bella.  She never would have caught him being human and it was once again Edward who selflessly looked out for Bella's best interest.  After the kiss in the book, you could feel Bella's guilt and regret.  She swore to herself to never hurt him this way again.  But in the movie, it was like she didn't even care.  All she could say was that \\"I don't know what happened.\\".  WTH! Is that really an acceptable excuse for making out with another guy? Hence one of the reasons I could barely stand her movie character.    I recommend that you read the book then watch the movie to fully understand the discrepancies.  I overall liked the movies, but I am not a huge fan of how Edward has been depicted.  It's not true to who he is and doesn't fully make people understand why Edward is so loved.  His character is theperfect mix of all-consuming love for Bella, protectiveness, and dominance.  I did not get this impression from the movie.
B00454U1NS|3.0|I'm not quite sure why \\"Raise your glass\\" had to even be recorded. Pink has some great songs. She is an open book lyrically, which is great. Many of her songs are really catchy. So I have no idea why Raise Your Glass happened. It's as if her management team said, \\"Hey Pink, we love what you've done. You've written some deeply personal songs, but the hit machine says we have to write something stupid about being in the club like every other carbon copy artist is doing now. Let's autotune the heck out of it, put in some dumb lyrics like you're too school for cool and how gangster you are. It will be a hit!\\"    Well, that is exactly what happened. It's a shallow, cookie cutter, garbage song that sounds just like a Katy Perry or Kesha song. I expected more from Pink. That's why my band, Asschowder, would not put out garbage like that. Our greatest hits package is coming with extensive liner notes written by a guy we know that reads books. You will learn what I like to order at a Chinese restaurant, What scares Burns about facebook, why J-Ab's stock keeps rising and why Kroll V-cuts. That is what people want, not some garbage song about the magical \\"club\\" all songs now reference. Leave that to the Black Eyed Peas, they've already sold out beyond repair. I expect more from Pink.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This is a great family movie if you have toddlers.  My son is 2 and he absolutely loves it.  He wakes up in the morning and it's the first word out his mouth, \\"Ponyo\\".  It's about a magical little fish that makes it to the shore and is found by a little boy.  He takes her and spends a day with her he names her Ponyo, and after a day she in turn wants to be human and eat ham just like the boy.  The fish's father disapproves and the movie transforms into this magical masterpiece.  Personally I enjoy watching it too; the colors are so vivid and the storyline is easy to follow.    When we go on long trips (6 or more hours in the car) we take the movie and wait till the little one is about to melt down in a toddler frenzy and we put the movie for him and it calms him down immediately.  He just zones out and we are able to drive in peace.  It is definitely a must have for kids.

0465092764|3.0|That is the author's contention, and it is difficult to disagree with. String theory has created a lot of interesting mathematics, and has shown mathematicians that the physicists' not-quite-rigorous methods can be quite powerful in uncovering mathematical truth. As physics, however, string theory has no predictive power, and thus is \\"not even wrong\\". So far so good.<br /><br />The author pretends that he can explain rather complicated mathematics to laymen (without any equations, yet). He cannot. I am a professional mathematician who works on some of the areas the author is trying to explain, and his explanations do not even make sense to me (he suffers from a popular delusion that repeating something many times somehow makes it clearer).<br /><br />Similarly, the discussion of the state of the art in experimental physics is an incomprehensible laundry list. Unless you know everything about this already, you will not learn anything.<br /><br />The only useful part of the book to me was a revelation that Schrodinger and Weyl did some wife swapping. Who knew?

0307266303|2.0|We're homo sapiens because we farm, no because we hunt, no because we run, no because we swim, no because we burp - blah,blah, blah...    OK - maybe I've read too much sports journalism and I've become cynical. But one thing I've learned is not to take seriously sports journalists who delve into the realm of pseudo-science, spirituality or grand theories of life on earth.    The author started out telling the story of ultra distance running Mexican Indians, the race that was organized to test them against Gringo ultras and wound up falling into the above trap. OK, if you like pop - science, I guess.    I even think that the description of the Tarahumara as super athletes is wrong. They are super long distance runners. Athleticism is much more than cardio-vascular endurance (speed, power, strength, flexibility, coordination). And without getting too scientific, evolutionary biologists usually site the advantage of the jack-of-all-trades over the master of one in the evolutionary struggle. Maybe that is why there are so few Tarahumura.    Also, I would seriously think twice before going barefoot on the road. Or having an exercise regime consisting solely of running tens of kms. a day.    Heres a thought: maybe what made homo-sapiens the rulers of the earth was the fact that they stopped trying to outrun predators and started to out think them by developing weapons. Eh...nah...too nonspiritual.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I purchased this for my brother's stepson and decided to watch it myself. I have to say that I absolutely loved and enjoyed it from start to finish. I have to admitt I was under the impression that Guru was going to be a villian from start to finish terrorizing kids in a funny way. So I was pleasantly surprised to see it not be the case but instead the movie weaved a great story of finding out where you truly belong; it was such a touching and creative message. I would recommend it! ;)

B0026A5TR6|1.0|Hi just took delivery off the first 12 Yes albums ( YES debut through to YESSHOWS )  in the SHMCD format.  Packaging is very nice, but no better than the original Mini LP releases in the late nineties ( the Japanese HDCD releases ). I will say that the HDCD discs actually use thicker card and paper, so one may argue they are in fact better packaged ?  BUT - and this is the big one - the new SHMCD discs sound awful !!!  I cant stress this enough. They sound too loud, and harsh, bright and nowhere near as refined as the RHINO reissues from a few years back.  It truly makes me wonder what cloth eared dimwit was responsible for this atrocity ! It looks like whoever did this work of audio vandalism took in most cases the RHINO masters ( it appears that to me that this is the case because the SHMCD discs have the same bonus tracks as the RHINO discs ). Then up the volume, and upped the treble...and compressed the hell out of the music !  Listen to Bills drums on Fragile ( Heart of the Sunrise )...the cymbals will now take your head off they are so sharp !  ear bleading painful !   These discs are truly a waste of money from an audio point of view.  If there is anything to be said for the SHMCD material, then I cannot for the life of me figure out what because the audio has been vandalised beyond belief !   And before anybody decides to diss me and say I dont know what Im talking about, can I say say I have pretty damn fine ears ( I am a classical musician ) and the hi fi system I use is pretty decent too. Im running a Metronome Kalista Reference CD transport, dCS Scarlatti DAC, Krell 700cx power amp and Wilson Audio 7 speakers, all plumbed with Transparent Reference cabling.....so if its crap then it sounds crap...this system doesnt hide the warts.   DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on these discs unless your after the paper sleeves and the audio is of secondary interest.  If the audio is important then I recommend you settle for the RHINO expanded remasters ( all still available, and a lot cheaper too )

B003RNU8KY|5.0|This album returns to classic 'Roots' traits - great live sounds and instruments, solid bars cover to cover from Black Thought and some great features like Phonte, Kid Cudi, etc.  I was disappointed with the last effort and have hope again.  I can't stop listening to this album, I skip no tracks!  Keep it coming!
B00377Z0Y4|5.0|An Incredible Reawakening of the Moribund Christmas Spirit    As usual Mr, Anderson, and his group of talented musicians, here delightfully blend: Baroque, Medieval, Modern Jazz, and Rock.(Not to mention many other musical idioms). Having said that; this wonderful set piece of yuletide cheer,(and sometimes sorrow), translates into one of the finest Christmas albums to become available in many years. It is such a wondrous thing to hear the Happiness, as well as the regret, imbued in the artistry of these beautifully written and performed songs.   Jethro Tull have always as a band, expressed a distinct personality, and an aborning originality.   That is singularly associated with them in my mind. Thus,concocting a wonderful pudding of melodic Yuletide harmony,and counterpoint.  When I want to feel the true spirit of Christmas. I never have far to travel, I put on The Jethro Tull Christmas Album. My love, and faith in mankind, and the holiday in which the holy child is enshrined. Become tangible once again. It becomes evident more , and more every year. As I listen to Mr. Anderson,and company. Then somehow, all of my negative feelings about the holiday suddenly disappear.

B001PO53IO|3.0|The kids were looking forward to watching this series on DVD.  We received two samples in action figures from this series.  The series was unrated, and so I purchased it for them.  The kids and I enjoyed it for the first 4 or 5 episodes.  Then, out of nowhere, the clones started swearing!  I know I'm a minority in caring about this with my kids (frankly, I could do without it in adult shows as well!), but I was very disappointed to have that happen.  My kids are too - they don't want to continue watching the series now.
142311339X|5.0|Excellent book! It is well written and begs for your attention. Once you start to read it, you will not want to put it down. My daughter loves his Percy Jackson series and has equally enjoyed this one as well. She wonders why she has to wait for the next book. She has reread this book and the Percy Jackson series countless times. She did not think he would be able to top his Percy Jackson books, but he has captivated her in this one. She is 9 years old and is anxiously waiting for the next book.   I have read these books as well for youngest child (7) as a bed time story. If you are a parent and looking for a book to put your child to sleep. This is not the book. He was caught up in the story and didn't want me to stop reading, he could not fall asleep on it. I had to pull out a Greek mythology book.   The books are well written, full of twists, adventure and educational. A must for any child.   I enjoyed the book as well and am looking forward to the next one.

0763644765|5.0|We bought this book as an introduction to potty training for my son. He hasn't quite learned how to use the potty yet from reading it, but he LOVES this book. We all think that the story is pretty funny, and the artwork is really cute and colorful. The genius is in the simplicity. The language on each page is minimal, so it's easy to extend the story by talking about what's happening on that page before my son is ready to turn to the next page. I like that it shows the baby sitting on the potty \\"waiting\\" for several pages in a row. I can tell my son is starting to make the connection that his new \\"potty seat\\" is for sitting on since looking at this book together. Now, if only we could get him to sit as still as the baby in the story, we'd be all set to get rid of those diapies for good!
B002UTNKWE|5.0|Recording and singers are excellent. Leontyne Price is peerless in almost all Verdi, and Bergonzi is simply outstanding.<br /><br />However, I regret that RCA did not include a libretto so that the listener can follow along with the drama. Instead, there is only an english synopsis. I'm sure this was a much cheaper alternative, but still---not cool! I would have also preferred a handsomer, box set package as older recordings have.<br /><br />All in all, 5 for the music and 3.5 for packaging and lack of handy libretto.

0061537969|4.0|I've read some of the reviews on here -- from the 5-star to the 1-star. And I have to say I liked this book. Given I have been reading some heavier books of late this was a breath of fresh air. This was from a dog's perspective and so while I'm sure it wasn't spot on if you're a *real* race driver or a *real* doctor -- dude, it was a funny, moving, lighthearted (at times), moving, fictional account of a dog with a human mind. It was a perfect book to read in one sitting and be entertained.    For awhile there I forgot that this book's narrator was a dog. I'm not a normal dog-lover - I love them from afar. But reading this book made me want to go out and buy a dog. If dogs could speak, I think this is how a lot of them would speak to us. I thought it was a very funny perspective. I loved the bits in the book when Enzo (the dog/narrator) describes how and why he does certain dog behaviors. I laughed at a lot of his antics, but what I most enjoyed was his loyalty to his owner and his family.     A great way to start of the holiday break. Thanks!

B00004RFFI|1.0|For the Fourth day of christmas I'm going to review...Twister. The only good thing about this film is the special effects. Everything else stinks. The acting,the story and the logic. The cast do alot of stupid things to get close to the twister like hiding under a brige even though it might collapse on you and/or turn into a wind tunnel of suction. Another dumb thing they do is use a belt,ties it to a heater to keep themself safe from the F-5. You make Odie look like Albert Einstein when you do dumb things like that. It would never work in real life. Flaw number 3: We see more of the couple arguing then the twister itself. When did this movie become \\"Mad About You\\"? The arguing couple storyline also slows the movie down. Did you also notice that there is more then one tornado in ONE DAY. HOW MANY TWISTERS CAN THERE BE IN 24 HOURS? Was this like the lost plague of Egypt? It does not happen in real life. Overall,If you like special effects,buy it. If not,burn it. I give this dvd a 1 out of 10.

0061730335|5.0|This story brings hope of things that are possible in a time when there is so much discouraging news in the world and from the African region in particular. The reader is drawn into William Kwamkwamba's life, his struggles and achievements and follows his efforts to obtain an education and a better, safer existence for his family, despite the poverty and challenges found in his village and country of Malawi.  A truly inspiring and insightful read, it is astounding to discover what this young man created, with extremely limited resources, and heart-warming, as well as exciting, to see William's achievements come to the attention of the global world. I encourage you to read this book and share it with others.
B001AQO446|5.0|I couldn't agree more with the reviews so far. This fantastic classic should have been out in Blu Ray years ago. I keep waiting for it but to no avail. We   need this out now. Come on people!!!
B00002SSKI|4.0|i have always loved ths movie since i was a kid, but only had it on VHS. sooo happy with my dvd purchase!
B004259BMM|5.0|I FEEL THIS CD IS THE BEST ONE SO FAR FROM KEITH URBAN.ALL THE SONGS ARE FANTASTIC. KITH SHOWS US ANOTHER SIDE OF HIM.I RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO HIS FANS
0316078913|5.0|David Sederis is amazing!
B0013O123Q|2.0|A good wine is a balance of acid and sweetness. This movie was all acid and left a sour taste in my mouth. If a filmmaker wants me to watch violence and cruelty fine, it can be interesting but not without a point to it. This movie struck me as a product of a filmmaker intentionally trying to be controversial and artsy and failing. No doubt people will blather on about the time space continuum and how clever he was to run the plot backwards but if you run any other movie backwards there's still a point to most of them. If you like violence, sadism, and 'artsy' for their own sake this may be your film. Otherwise choose again because this film offers nothing else to satisfy.
B002MU4NLI|2.0|I was very excited about getting this movie, and the only reason I got the more expensive one was because I wanted the ornament for our tree. well to my disappointment, the ornament was busted. Completely pushed in one side. The package was intact, so I know it didn't happen in the shipping. The ornament was displayed in a clear front of the box, and you can clearly see it was busted. Which only makes me wonder what kind of person sends something when they can clearly see it's broken.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is without a doubt, the best version of Charles Dickens: A Christmas Carol. The message is delivered in a fun way with The Muppets. Michael Caine is a terrific Scrooge, miserly enough to apprehend, but lovable enough to root for. Sweet and funny with some great songs that you can't help singing along with. It is a tradition in our family to watch every Christmas Day. The little ones will love this version. The ghosts are whimsical and not scary in the least, the way only a Jim Henson production can be.
B003EI2EH2|2.0|Tim Ferris starts his book: \\"Please don't be stupid and kill yourself.  It would make both of us unhappy.  Consult a doctor before doing anything in this book.\\"  The first rule of medicine is do no harm.  I'm an M.D. Take him at his word.  In his chapter on \\"reversing permanent injuries,\\" Tim explains how he went to a doctor in Arizona who injected him with \\"everything but the kitchen sink.\\"  The final cocktail included platelet-rich plasma, stem cell factor, bone morphogenic protein 7, and insulin growth factor 1. The result was emergency surgery at UCSF following a staph infection in his elbow.  He still thinks the medication was right, but \\"I didn't find the right person to administer it.\\"  Does he have any idea what all that stuff could do to his immune system?  The reason for his attempt at regenerative medicine - many injuries.  His \\"pushing the envelope\\" had produced 20 fractures, 20 dislocations, two joint surgeries and innumerable tears and sprains.  His orthopedist told him (p.297) that he was \\"a 30 year old in a 60 year old body.\\"  Before you buy his book, consider Tim's own history.   There is excellent advice here on motivation, an excellent chapter by Ben Goldacre on what really happens in drug research, many provocative ideas.  But a diet suggesting mandatory bingeing?  Sleeping effectively two hours a day?  For those attracted by his video which promises \\"you can do the impossible,\\" I would ask this - consider what the impossible might do to you.
0765326353|5.0|Dalinar, Kaladin and Shallan are the main characters in this extensive novel. Sanderson not only tells a fantastic story, he also crafts fantastic characters. The stories of the primary characters are told separately for the most part, and Sanderson does such a fantastic job, no matter which story was being told, I couldn't wait to get back to the other two. Sanderson not only tells a great story, but he also deals with big themes like prejudice, honor and duty. I don't know how this book could have been better. I definitely am anxiously awaiting the next installment of this 10-part series.
B000002QWD|5.0|I had ordered this to give as a gift for Christmas and was upset to find that the CD case has a huge crack right through the middle, rendering it unfit to give.  It is still in the cellophane wrapping, but I am not going to go to the trouble to return it at such a busy time of year and it only cost $3.99. I am reluctant to order it a second time because I would really be upset if a second one arrived cracked.  In general, I am extremely happy with my dealings over many years with amazon, but not this time!!  I was not going to give this a poor, one star, review, because this is an album (I'm old enough to call it an album) that brings back fond memories of my childhood Christmases.
1416550550|5.0|This is exactly the kind of novel I love.....I already miss the characters and am ready to re-read it!  This is my favorite book since The Memory Keepers Daughter.  Just a really great story!  If you love historical fiction, a bit of mystery, and a touch of romance you will LOVE this book!
B002ZG99NG|5.0|THE TOWN follows Doug MacRay, a bank robber, who falls in love with the victim of one of his heists.  It is the story of a man's struggle with his own identity, against the backdrop of the criminal community in which he was raised.<br /><br />That's a neat summary; really, no more is needed.  THE TOWN is a marvel.  I've never been a fan of Ben Affleck's acting; he's held his own on occasion (DOGMA), but he's let me down quite often.  Here, he shines.  It also helps that he's directing.  TOWN captures the vibe of GONE BABY GONE, without retreading any previous territory.  It is a gripping tale that also features stellar performances from John Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Chris Cooper (grossly underused, as he tends to be), Pete Postlethwaite, Blake Lively, and especially Jeremy Renner as MacRay's psychotic friend.  Almost all of the film's acting is solid; it's rooted deep in the Boston community (again, think GONE BABY GONE, or a watered-down DEPARTED), and the characters jump to life.<br /><br />It's hard, grasping just what makes this movie stand out.  Yet, it does.  It isn't just another crime thriller.  It isn't on the level of THE DEPARTED or HEAT, or arguably even GONE BABY GONE (which at least benefited from Dennis Lehane's stellar novel); yet, THE TOWN is destined to stand as a classic Boston crime film.  Largely, this is due to Affleck's directing; never entirely comfortable before the camera, he has found his true calling as a director, able to bring about the absolute best from his cast (including himself).  For a film whose ending is predictably violent (yes, you'll see it coming), THE TOWN emerges surprisingly original and fresh.  It's a crime film worth repeated viewing; its characterization, and its immersion in its setting, help it stand out from the pact of films passing themselves off as \\"heist capers\\" these days.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I've always loved the Christmas Carol story and have collected many of the different versions, but this version is by far, the best ever. The visuals are stunning and Jim Carrey's character portrayals are brilliant! I highly recommend that everyone buy this and make watching it with your family a Christmas tradition!
B002T45VX6|1.0|I'm not a huge Shakira fan, however I'll admit I enjoyed Oral Fixation 1 and 2 (with exception of the horrid Hips Don't Lie), and some of her Spanish stuff. She reminds me of the singer of the Cranberries. She has an AMAZING voice. That said, without hearing anything, I decided I'd give Shakira's She Wolf a try. Big mistake. This is quite possibly the worst release of 2009 I've heard, and the very reason I don't listen to modern pop.<br /><br />She Wolf is honestly just a mess. Truth be told, there isn't a single song on here that stands out to me at all. There are a few moments of brilliance which are suddenly cut short by cringe-worthy moments. It's like looking at painting with small amounts of poop smeared on it. You can look at it but it's hard to enjoy because you can't take your eyes off the poop.<br /><br />SHE WOLF: \\"I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday, and Friday to Friday.\\" Seriously? I know English isn't her first language but seriously she could try much better than this. The beat is catchy but has been done before. That chorus has some hilarious sounding autotune on it too.<br /><br />DID IT AGAIN: Then we have this hip hop mess with embarassing lyrics and a sound that can be found on any Lil Wayne album (and Lil Wayne sucks). Nuff said.<br /><br />LONG TIME: This song is honestly the reason I've disregarded people like Shakira due to the mainstream appeal. Honestly, does Shakira even know who she is anymore???<br /><br />WHY WAIT and GOOD STUFF are so boring that I can't even remember them.<br /><br />MEN IN THIS TOWN: This had the potential to be a good dance tune. It has a catchy beat, but the chorus is so autotune laden and the post-chorus is so dumb. And the Matt Damon line? *shudder*<br /><br />GYPSY: Here's another song that could be a good track. But then we get to the chorus and she throws sound at us with the sitar. I listen to Dream Theater's cover of To Tame A Land and I feel the sitar is there for a reason. Here she's just doing it and throwing sound at us again.<br /><br />SPY: \\"There's a spy outside my window, I know it's you.\\" WTF. That does not make sense at all. But that's not where it stops. The \\"Wopwopwop\\" that goes throughout the song makes me wanna stab my ears with rusty nails. And Will.I.Am proves yet again why he should not be allowed near a mic, ever.<br /><br />If you remember MON AMOUR, you are too much of a Shakira fan, and having SHE WOLF in a Spanish version (Loba) doesn't make it any less sucky.<br /><br />Honestly this is probably the worst Shakira album ever. She REALLY seems to be having an identity crisis here. Shakira hun, PLEASE get back to your roots. They made you who you are!'s a spy outside my window, I know it's you.\\" WTF. That does not make sense at all. But that's not where it stops. The \\"Wopwopwop\\" that goes throughout the song makes me wanna stab my ears with rusty nails. And Will.I.Am proves yet again why he should not be allowed near a mic, ever.    If you remember MON AMOUR, you are too much of a Shakira fan, and having SHE WOLF in a Spanish version (Loba) doesn't make it any less sucky.    Honestly this is probably the worst Shakira album ever. She REALLY seems to be having an identity crisis here. Shakira hun, PLEASE get back to your roots. They made you who you are!
1440503257|5.0|Just got this as an early Christmas gift from my mother because I'm planning a \\"Christmas at Hogwarts\\" feast, and I literally read it cover to cover and could not put it down. Aside from looking cool on your counter, the recipes are chock full of clever information and history about traditional British cookery and explains some of the foods that are lost in translation for Americans. The recipes contain easy step-by-step instructions and encourages you to try new things. My only complaint (and it's a very small one) is that because the book is geared toward the younger crowd, the traditional alcohols like mead and wine usually added to these kinds of dishes are omitted entirely from some recipes (but, oddly, not others), and you need to go to the author's website to see how much and where to add them in. But it is an excellent book to have in the kitchen and I know I'm going to make full use of the recipes in the coming year :D
B000EQH2QK|4.0|Just to make it short and sweet.<br /><br />GREAT TRACKS:<br />How Do You Do<br />Illegal<br />Costume Makes The Clown<br />Your Embrace<br /><br />DECENT TRACKS:<br />Something<br />Timor<br />The Day and the Time<br />Your Embrace<br /><br />HORRID TRACKS:<br />Pretty much all the singles, and Hey You.<br /><br />Overall I'm not a Shakira or modern pop fan, but I think this is a solid album and a good way to kill some time. Recommended, just as long as you're prepared to hit the \\"skip\\" button a few times.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|This turned out to be a great move and I would have given it five stars but for the ending. It is a great recreation of 12th Century England (and France) and almost all are five stars; actors, acting, scenes, storyline etc. Unfortunately they put in a D-Day ending with the French army landing on the English coast at a military horrible place and using vaguely disguised LCTs with people rowing them! Sorry but there went the fifth star. I would anyway recommend this to anyone as a good film and of course it was more or less made as part one of a series. This is a film about how Robin Hood was created and not about the Robin Hood we grew up with.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|I am always a bit leery when sequels of movies come out because they oftentimes don't compare to the first one. However, Toy Story 3 was easily as good as Toy Story 1 (Toy Story 2 was my least favorite, but still very good!) The themes of loyalty and courage were apparent in the film, as was compassion, forgiveness, and redemption. Such themes make for great discussion-starters with children. Note to parents: there were a couple of \\"scary\\" parts that might be frightening to very young children (toddlers), especially when the \\"good\\" toys were imprisioned and near the end during a scene at the dump. Parents of the very young will want to sit and watch this movie with their children and add some snuggles and reassurance. Other than that, this movie is a must-see and I have added it to my list on my blog of Mom-Approved Movies.<br /><br />An added bonus: I enjoyed seeing in the movie some toys I played with as a child. What fond memories...I remember especially the little toy telephone, the monkey doll, and of course, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head.
0321687299|4.0|HTML5 is still pretty much a moving target, it's good to be familiar with it and the innovations that brings to the table, but implementation among various browsers is still spotty at the time of writing. The author are clearly aware of this, so they aren't trying to cover everything that HTML5 and related technologies bring to the table, the book is mostly focused on how you can use HTML5 here and now. So this isn't going to be a reference book that would last for many years, read it now because it's going to become more or less outdated as soon as browsers will improve in the near future.    Bruce and Remy are really passionate about the subject, and they somewhat tend to assume a kind of \\"evangelist\\" tone, something I don't like very much (maybe that's just me). Still they know very well what they are talking about, and the info they deliver is worth reading and absorbing.    Just a note on typography, New Riders usually does a very good job on printing visually appealing books. But this time I feel they made something wrong, many code samples don't stand out enough from the rest of the page, making them hard to spot and read them when you are quickly scanning the pages.
0061730335|5.0|This book is as indicated in the title!  It's inspirational because it shows how one can achieve success--no matter what the odds--if they only have the motivation and faith to do so.  William went from extreme poverty, suffered famine, was deprived of education past grade 6, and yet still had the will and desire to educate himself and achieve the lofty goal of providing electricity to his family's home.  It was insightful in that it reveals the internal desire or motivation that even the poorest and most uneducated people possess to achieve success.  Even though William was denied formal schooling and had only a rudimentary knowledge of English and electronics, he still taught himself everything he needed to know to achieve his goal.<br /><br />This is eye-opening to people and educators everywhere because so many people fail to see the potential that exists in all people regardless of race, color, wealth, class, or even education level.  It reminds us that there are \\"diamonds in the rough\\" everywhere if we only take the time to find and cultivate them as Dr. Mchazime did when he \\"found\\" William.  Furthermore, this story reminds us that there are still miracles out there, even if we don't see them everyday or in our own lives all the time.  It was the best book I have read in quite some time and I highly recommend it to any parent, educator, or other person who works with children in any way:  look for those diamonds because they might be the next Einstein!
B000008H4E|5.0|Vangelis finds his Aphrodites Child and Anderson finds his soul mate. Short stories is the perfect balance of two geniuses at the top of their game. Truly awesome sounds, compositions, playgrounds, musicians, events, universal connections, compasion, electronic beauty and universal love, here and now and then and where. Just fantastic.
B00192IV9U|5.0|A fantastic album by the King of Pop. The highlights are Another Day, Hollywood Tonight, and Behind d the Mask.  A must buy for any lover of music.
B000002GB4|5.0|STYX is still touring the road today and playing this entire CD will lay out some of the early stuff from this great band, see them today if you get the chance for one of the greatest nights of rock you will ever see from a great band, Tommy Shaw, James Young, Lawrence and the rest are ROCK STARS TODAY not just in the past.
0767817478|2.0|this movie blows!, i wasted a perfectly good 7 dollars and wasted 1 hour and 40 mins of my life!!!!!!! and after i watched it i threw it into my fire place and then buried the burnt to a crisp remains in a small pit in my back yard  the best part of the movie was the credits and an even better part was turning off my tv!, i did enjoy eating popcorn while watching it though, go ahead and rent it but dare not to buy it, owning this dvd is like a plague and will cause you to do drugs and will also cause spontaneous combustion to your tv, house, and viewers if this movie to get 1st and 2nd degree burns to the eyes and chest.
B000002GB2|5.0|Just listen to it , go see this great band and you will see why they still pack the house every night on tour.
0140277447|4.0|I listened to an unabridged version of this book from audible while on my work commute. With young kids, I have troubles finding time to read in the evenings and audio books are my primary \\"reading\\" mechanism. I would have given up on this book if I had to read it at home. So, why the high rating?  Quite frankly, Ms. Chang has illuminated a horrendous event that up to the near present was almost forgotten, the brutal sacking of the city and people of Nanking by the Japanese army in 1937-8. This story needs to be taught in schools along with the Holocaust as examples of crimes against humanity.  It is a sorry tale  of humanity at it's worst and best. The worst was the killing, mutilation, and rape that Nanking residents had to endure by the occupying Japanese army. An estimated 200,000-300,000 Chinese men, women, and children died at the hands of the Japanese military.  Untold thousands had to endure daily threats of assaults, rape, and murder. Did anything occur that brought out the best in humanity?  Fortunately, a small group of foreigners including a representative of the Nazi party were able to protect many hundreds of thousands through pure force of will.     As mentioned above, I alluded to certain imperfections I found in the book.  First, the book is depressing and describes acts of brutality that are difficult to listen to. Second, I believe the book could have been cut in half without minimizing the this brutal event. The author's decision to write the book from the perspective of the Japanese, Chinese, and Westerners was interesting but also meant similar material was repeated. Third, the author spends quite a bit of time detailing the Japanese lack of official remorse. I think her point could have been delivered with far less prose.     In conclusion, the author's prose makes this book a difficult read  However, you should read this book (or listen to the audio recording) as a reminder of the dark deeds humanity is capable of as well as a memorial to thepeople of Nanking.
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|It was an excellent movie and Pitt was outstanding.  Having said that, it was not so much entertaining, as it was challeging to stick with it in the beginning.  A bit slow paced, dark, and more about death than life. A conundrum.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I loved this serie and am glad to have it but was very upset that I pre-ordered at $90 and found after it was delivered you had cut the price to $78. Shame on you!
B0036EBARO|4.0|This is a great album. I haven't heard them in the US but my cousin in England went to go see them, so I checked them out. \\"Rocket\\" is my favorite song on this album but they are all good. Hope they come to the US sometime so I can see them!     CD was in wonderful shape eventhough it was a used CD.
B0002PZVHK|5.0|I first heard this masterpiece in 1986 and up until then I could not find a collection of works that did not waver from the slow, pure ambient meditatative dream quality i was looking for. Most of the albums I had heard were slow up until a certain point, then they would suddenly have a loud or hectic piece that would destroy the atmosphere. This was the first piece of music that kept the dream state going through to its end. While listening to it in preparation to sleep it was the only album that would finish without waking me. This is my favourite ambient album of all time and I never tire of listening to it. When I listen to it a sense of relief flows over my mind and spirit because I feel comfortable and in tune with its superior composition. I love this album for its purity of atmosphere which can be uplifting in some parts and at others be brooding howls from the darkest corner of the earth.

0887307280|5.0|I was expecting managerial balloon juice, but this turned out to be a very helpful and informative book.  If you are thinking about starting a business, this book will give you an extremely valuable perspective on planning it.  Some reviewers have stated that this book is nothing more than a pitch for franchising businesses.  Actually, the author does not argue that you should develop and sell franchises of your business.  Rather, he states that one should take the franchise model as a way to streamline, systematize, and document your business functions so that when your business begins to grow, you can hire people to do the work the way you want it done.  This allows you to focus on entrepreneurial (as opposed to technical) matters and keeps you from being the repository of all the expertise in the firm (which would force you to do everything in the office anyway, making employees worse than useless).  Also, a documented system of conducting your business will add value to it by allowing you to show how it works to people who might be interested in buying your business in the future.  Obviously, if you find yourself with the next McDonald's on your hands, franchising might be the way to go, but the author does not argue that any particular business should franchise, only that the franchise model has lessons to teach every business.

B00192IV9U|5.0|I have really been enjoying \\"Michael\\" and I am glad that I purchased it. I haven't been skipping songs, which is unusual for me. My favorite songs are Hollywood Tonight, Best Of Joy, (I Can't Make It) Another Day (Featuring Lenny Kravitz) and Behind The Mask. My least favorite song is Breaking News, but it is still a good song. In my opinion this album is better than 90% of the music that plays on the radio today. I really don't understand all of the controversy regarding this album. I have been a Michael Jackson fan for at least 30 years, and it is his voice. Teddy Riley admits that Melodyne was used on a few of the tracks, but I can still tell that it is Michael singing.
B0045LSIRM|5.0|The best live album that I've ever heard or one of the best live albums from one of the best musicians from the last 3 decades and he's still going strong.  An original and there will be a lot of so-called musicians imitate or mimmick what Bryan Adams has accomplished with his \\"Bare Bones Tour\\".  \\"Often imitated but never duplicated!\\"
B003EV6DBM|5.0|David Tennant was a fantastic Doctor-my favorite, and I miss him very much! I must say that I AM impressed with Matt Smith and I hope he sticks around for a while. My favorite episodes of this season are \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", The Hungry Earth\\", and \\"The Pandorica Opens\\".
B004EI3ON4|2.0|I've been a Daft Punk fan for years, and was excited to hear what they would do with the chance to score a full length film.    Unfortunately, the boys of Daft Punk have turned out a boringly unoriginal soundtrack.  What's on this album could have been churned out by anyone with basic mixing skills.      The only two times there's even a hint of the \\"Daft Punk\\" edge is on two tracks, \\"End of Line\\", which starts out with some promise, then fizzles out.  \\"Derezzed\\" has some killer beats, but leaves the listener woefully unsatisfied when it fizzles out at just over a minute and a half.      To give you an idea how boring this album is:  I decided to listen to it while I was at the gym, which is about the only place I have enough time to listen an album from start to finish.  I realized about half way through that I was actually listening to the standard issue top 40 the gym plays OVER the Daft Punk soundtrack.  Yeah, that bad.    Skip this album.  Period.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|I had a hard time sitting through this entire film.  Maybe it is because I can almost recite the whole Christmas Carol movie by heart from all the different versions I have seen.  But, this has to be one of the worst versions I have ever seen.  I was so disappointed in it.  I thought it would be funny, but I just found it stupid.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I had heard about this movie when it came out, but never got to see it, so I finally bought it, I've seen it several time's now, I really like it, I'm a picker so I like the music, and the story line, I'd recommend it, it's worth the watch! Thanks Shooter!
0735204314|5.0|This is a wonderful book if you are on the spiritual path!  It focuses on \\"New Thought\\" (very different from \\"New Age\\").  It is about recognizing the God within each one of us and the power to change our lives for the better when that recognition occurs.

0061730335|5.0|The Boy who Harnessed the Wind is an incredible read. It is an inspiring life story of William Kamkwamba life growing up in an African village. He tells stories from his childhood about how hard his mother and father worked and how their were many nights he had no choice but to go to bed hungry. But he does not let this detour from the goals that has made for his life. His village is suffering because of deforestation and a tyrant government in which make it hard for many villages to survive.    As an educator is taught me how the small things in life can have a huge impact on your future. Setting goals and working hard toward your goals is a characterstic I want all my students to possess. William is an inspiration because he had a hard knock life growing up but did not give up or give in to his surroundings. He pushed through his hardships and continued to get his education so he could be the scientis that he always dreamed about and bring electricity to his village using a windmill.

B004K4IZ54|4.0|28 years, 161 days later, Tron's legacy lives on. Joe Kosinkski's understated long-awaited sequel to Steven Lisberger's game changing electronic mythos is a visual triumph, a world unlike anything we've ever seen before, transforming the iconography of its predecessor into an awesome 3D spectacle, but it is an imperfect world, its breathtaking three dimensions propped upon the two dimensional pillars of its problematic plot and one that would be looked upon with the consternation of its biggest adversary who, ironically, is the one who nearly completely undermines and very nearly derezzes it... Clu... and the guy doesn't dig imperfection.<br /><br />The film's biggest special effect is also its biggest failure. The technology that I had hoped would be the promise of taking Tron once again to a new revolutionary cinematic level and breaking new technical ground in much the same way as the original film had ushered in a new era at the dawn of the digital filmmaking frontier demonstrates that we still have quite a ways to go before digital actors can convincingly look indistinguishable from real human performers and reinforces the theory of the \\"Uncanny Valley\\" in robotics that says the closer we get to making artificial constructs look human the more we can identify their subtle inhuman imperfections. The CGI animation used to make Jeff Bridges look 20 years younger more closely resemble the animated cut-scenes from its video game counterpart [[ASIN:B0030MQPQ8 TRON: Evolution]]. Comparing it to how he looks in other earlier films of his career like [[ASIN:B001AQMBNC Starman]] it's obvious that Bridges did not look quite like his poorly rendered doppleganger at that age. The eyes, the brows, the cheekbones, and the mouth have an unconvincing artificiality about them that betrays the illusion and his aged voice also belies the effect. In a creepy sort of way it almost works for the character within the context of the story because he is supposed to be an artificial construct and we can almost buy that he doesn't look quite like a real human being, but during the film's opening scenes when we see Bridges in flashback playing younger Kevin Flynn telling bedtime stories to his son, Sam, it robs the moment between a father and his son of its already forced sincerity and dehumanizes it in a cold and unsettling way.<br /><br />The plot is almost video-game like in its objective as the competing faction of Clu's militaristic forces must obtain elder Flynn's identity disc which is a master key to unlock the door to our world so that he and his army can take it over. It is never convincingly explained how exactly virtual programs existing in the digital world can somehow manifest themselves into tangible living matter in our physical world with Flynn's disc like a magician pulling a rabbit out of an ethereal hat, just as it does not attempt to explain why a User like Sam can bleed in its digital realm other than the fact he is simply a User and \\"he's different,\\" nor does it attempt to explain how Kevin Flynn has aged 20 years trapped in his digital confinement when theoretically he shouldn't have physically aged at all as a digital avatar of himself. Narratively it misses those opportunities to explore such metaphysical questions as it so masterfully eluded to in the film's promising test trailer shown at Comic Con the way that the original [[ASIN:B00005OCMR Tron]] explored such intriguing philosophical ideas around the religious beliefs of its programs and their creators. Tron Legacy's most astonishing revelation delivered by Alan when he tells Sam that his father was about to change science, medicine and religion in such a profound way is simply thrown away in a single line of expository dialogue. We never learn the real reason why Flynn created this world in the first place other than the fact that it was far out biodigital jazz, man.<br /><br />Once again Jeff Bridges is the chemistry that holds the foundations of the Troniverse together solely with his strength and conviction of his performance as zen guru cyber-Jesus Flynn to his Judas megalomaniacal alter-ego Clu in some sort of virtual yin and yang. Garret Hedlund is surprisingly likeable as his son, Sam. Thankfully, he's no wooden Hayden Christiansen (although he would have made a much better Anakin Skywalker) and plays the cliched angst-ridden rebellious youth with convincingly noble admiration. Reciprocally, Olivia Wilde plays the character of Quorra with a truthful childlike innocence and wonder that demonstrates she has more to offer as an actress than just luscious fanboy eyecandy. Michael Sheen livens the film as Castor with his jestly rendition of David Bowie circa glam rock era Ziggy Stardust. And once again Bruce Boxleitner returns as Alan Bradley aka Tron... sort of. After all it's called TRON Legacy, right? Though, like the first film, the story is centered around Flynn's character and his legacy of which Tron is merely incidental to. The enigmatic character of Rinzler is Clu's henchman, one part Darth Maul wielding two discs, and one part Boba Fett as a mysterious tracker whose helmeted identity is concealed and it doesn't take half a nerd to figure out who he is.<br /><br />As a 3D film Tron Legacy's illuminated electronic visuals perfectly lends itself to creating brightly rendered 3D images which has been the pitfall of all other 3D films. Tron Legacy is by far the real Avatar. It makes the world of Pandora look like a cartoon by comparison. The Grid is a place I would want to visit again because it is unlike anything seen in our world or any other. The brilliantly 3D rendered Disney logo showcasing the Magic Kingdom \\"Tronified\\" is appropriately memorable for setting the tone of the film which is then 2D until Sam is transported into Tron's colorful three dimensional illuminated world like Dorothy in the [[ASIN:B00388PK1A The Wizard of Oz]]. As a first-time director Joe Kosinski proves that he has the technical prowess to design a fully immersive world much like Ridley Scott did with Alien and Blade Runner but his weakness is marshaling a bullet-proof script equally as flawless to support it, but then again the original Tron, to be fair, didn't necessarily have a solid script to support it either so in that sense they are both equally as flawed and both equally as visually stunning.<br /><br />As a fan of the original Tron I am torn. Part of me is protective of its mythos and at the same time heartbroken that what was once a unique, groundbreaking film has now been rendered obsolete by its own sequel that has taken the technology and improved upon it in nearly every visual way. The Lightcycle and Disc Wars sequences, for example, are spectacularly exhilarating and render the graphics in the original film relics of the Atari age by comparison and why Disney has wisely kept the original Tron film hidden away in its vaults and hasn't released it on blu-ray yet to avoid the inevitably unfair comparisons. Fortunately as a sequel it delivers without the bitter disappointment of sequels like Star Wars or Indiana Jones. It's no Phantom Menace or Crystal Skull, thank God. If it performs well there will no doubt be more Tron films that confident Disney has stated they already have in development along with an animated TV show Tron Uprising and will hopefully include the participation of Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner to make them work. Without them, it wouldn't be a Tron film at all. Tron lives.

I think Franzen is absolutely deserving of all praise that he has been given. He is outstandingly talented in his word usage and in the development of his characters. What an awesome story and what perfect escape and exercize for my brain!
B003VS0CYC|4.0|I'm not really going to review these I reviewed them back in May 09. Cause the sequels Robocop 2 & 3 have been put on Blu Ray.     Robocop 1987 Great movie I've seen this on VHS DVD now on Blu Ray we all know the story Alex Murphy a cop was killed by a gang leader Clerance Bodicker & OCP executive Dick Jones is a financer & aids him & his gang. Murphy has been harvested for the Robocop program by Bob Morton. Robocop basically cleans up the streets Jones is wasn't too happy about it cause The Old Man didn't approve The ED 209 so he sends Clerance Bodicker to kill Bob Morton. We all know how it goes.   Stars Peter Weller Kurtwood Smith Nancy Allen Daniel O'Herilhy & Ronny Cox. Transfer is very good. I hear people complain about it but it's the best the movie has ever looked.     Robocop 2 1990 Not as good but it is a good sequel I actually saw this 1 1st recored off TV. It deals with a new drug called Nuke & Drug Cult led by Cain & has a kid as a villain & he was actually intresting. Some people Robocop 2 for being darker. It does have some things I don't care for like who would put a drug dealers brain into a machine but it has a straight forwar simple effective plot good kills good gore & some really AWESOME stop motion! I would love to read Frank Miller's original script I would like to see the workprint version cause there was stuff cut out according to Ivan Kershner who died recently I would like an extended edition of this movie. Peter Weller Nancy Allen Tom Noonan Daniel O'Herilhy all star in this the transfer is good & of course the best it's ever looked.     Robocop 3 1993 It's an ok movie it has a lot of problems like R1 & R2 were both R rated they decided to make it kid friendly make it PG13 to get a bigger audience cause Robocop wasn't popular anymore but it only made $10 million. Robert John Burke I thought was good as Robocop he was ok as Murphy he wasn't hardcore like Peter Weller. Nancy Allen asked returned as Lewis but she asked for her character to be killed off cause she felt like they were milking the franchise. I like the plot actually there was some decent action it deals with the rebels led by this lady named Bertha. CCH Pounder Remy Ryan Jill Hennessy are good but the villains are the worst there even worse than Prime Directives Rip Torn is no Daniel O'Herilhy or Ronny Cox. The Commander of the Rehabs McDagget played by John Castle he's no Kurtwood Smith or Tom Noonan. Sargent Reid was awesome in this though played by Robert Du Qui. There's these Robot Ninja's there stupid plus there is this guy at Security Concepts & everybody on the board is 10 miles ahead of this guy. But I'd rather watch this over T3. Cause Robocop was a thing of it's time & T3 had expectation. If you want the 1st movie uncut on Blu Ray along with the sequels on Blu Ray you should get this cuase this will be the only time Robocop 2&3 will be on Blu Ray.
B001R10BMS|5.0|It was an honor and a pleasure to be a part of this film, one of the best Connery films. As you know this is a rehash of Thunderball, and the runt of bond films because it was not produced by Albert Broccoli. With the rights to Thunderball and Connery as the first Bond production began as Broccoli and Director John Glen were filming Octopussy. A number of legal battles which ended with Broccoli agreeing that two Bond films of the two best Bond's released near together would please the fans as thus history is made. Critics argue the point of it echoing Thunderball, but we must remember we are lucky the thing got off the ground to begin with, legal battles and right contentions forced the script to parallel Thunderball. As for my part I got the plerasure of dieing not once but three times comming back to life and eventually switching sides all due to the magic of Hollywood Disguise and special effects. This roll is amung my favorets   Christopher Stewart Actor/Stuntman
0446310786|5.0|When I was in school this was a required read. I read the cover and made my report without reading the whole book.

He really causes you to see what you are doing in a new light. ( if you will pardon the pun)  He shows you what he did to achieve the effects in each lesson and discusses why he missed catching certain things and why he succeeded in others. He points out how light and color affect your view and how a camera can lie when you are working from a photo.<br /><br />When I finished my first reading of this book I could see an improvement in my work.<br /><br />His use of color and of light is exquisite and he is able to pass on what it is he looks for and does so your work improves because of it.<br />Who can ask for more?
B002ZG99A4|3.0|Given the big name stars in this movie, I was a little disappointed with the movie.  Individually, the stars of this movie have done better movies.  I would reccomend the movies Taken and Shoot'Em Up as action movies that are better than The Expendables.
B00337KM2S|5.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. George Clooney plays a guy whose job it is to go into companies and fire people. That's the basic premise, but this film is much more than that. It also focuses on his lifestyle: living out of a suitcase, with a practically unfurnished apartment that he \\"visits\\" only a few days a year, and no significant relationships to speak of. Both his professional and personal lives take drastic turns, and that is really what makes this movie appealing. This is a movie that evokes a wide spectrum of emotions, and that is truly what a good movie should do.

0792164903|5.0|This Tim Burton film starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci borrows characters and the setting from Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, but otherwise bears no resemblance to the story. Although I am usually unhappy when Hollywood drastically alters a classic, I was happily surprised with this film.<br /><br />Depp plays Ichabod Crane, a New York City police detective rather than Irving's schoolmaster. The time is 1799. Crane is despised by the New York authorities because he uses scientific methods to solve crimes as opposed to the old-fashioned methods of beatings and torture. To get him out of their hair, he is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate three grisly murders. All of the victims have been decapitated.<br /><br />The film is very atmospheric and you get the feeling of gloom that sets in during the late fall after all the leaves have fallen from the trees, the days are short and dark, and winter will soon arrive. The Oscar nomination for best cinematography is well earned.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow is not for young children or sensitive viewers as there is a lot of blood and gore, but everyone else should enjoy this film - especially if viewed in late October or early November and of course at night.
B001U887VA|5.0|I am very happy with the clogs.  I wear them every day; they are so nice and warm and have a very solid sole and great support.  I wear them as slippers but go outdoors for newspaper, etc. and they have good traction and safe on stairs.  I would highly recommend them.
B000O599ZS|5.0|John Wayne, actor, and John Ford, director, have collaborated successfully for more than a dozen films. The Searchers offers a realistic view of the West after the Civil War. The acting, the scenery, and the music produce a touch of the innocent beauty and of the awful brutality of life in the old west. Big John Wayne is the macho king, driven to find his niece, a captive of the Comanche. This film is a classic of its kind.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|The teenage Victoria struggles with the adults around her that want to control her life and destiny as best as they can. Her mother and scheming John Conroy want to take the power and act as her regent in the days before the King dies. Her uncle, King of the Belgians, is planning on marrying her to someone who will do his bidding in the English court. Lord Melbourne is entrancing her and almost causes a constitutional crisis due to her stubbornness. But Albert comes to her aid, helps her see her way and she proposes to him to marry. Wonderful costumes (worthy of an Oscar) and a small glimpse into royal life will provide interesting movie entertainment.

B0049VGTGA|4.0|This is a review of the sounds quality only.  If you are reading this you already have an opinion on the merits of the material.  I have has the domestic CD for years and it was always flat sounding, no real punch or spark.  I picked up the Japanese release a few years back of Face Value and it was better.  It was not a huge improvement but definately better.  Enough so that I also ordered Jacket and Sussudio after.  I thought they would be the best I could do for the first 3 Phil Collin's releases.    The Audio Fidelity version is a vast improvement over all the other digital versions.  The playback level is much lower than other CDs.  I had to turn the volume knob much higher than I normally do.  This seemed to be true on all tracks except the last one which I found I had to lower the volume to still higher than normal but not by much.  It sounded louder than the other tracks.  I do not know if this was just me, I do not think so.    The punch is solid on this release.  The trumpets sound great and the marimba on Hand in Hand sounded great.  I am a sucker for marimba though.  I think you will be pleased with the sound if you have a higher end system.  I am looking forward to the same treatment of Jacket in Jan of 2011.    I am giving 4 stars because it is not among the best audiophile quality I have in my collection, though it is well above average.    Enjoy!

B0041KKYEM|4.0|Black Swan tells the story of a troubled young dancer. Withdrawn and focused on perfection, she channels in her tiny, muscled body the ambition and resentment of her overbearing mother. Natalie Portman gives a stunning performance as Nina, who's won the role of the Swan Queen in an ambitious adaptation of Tchakovsky's Swan Lake ballet. She begins to break down under the strain of a demanding choreographer, who insists she be more passionate, and a controlling mother who wishes her to remain a biddable child. I never expected a story about ballerinas could be so viscerally intense - at once moving and horrific. It's a small, simple film that aims to do just what good psychological horror does, to affect the viewer, to disorient and frighten. Worked for me.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I'll keep it short and to the point:    COMMUNITY is a great show. It has a talented cast; the writers have a solid idea of who the characters are and why they're funny, and they're not afraid to spotlight that or to push the boundaries of the typical sitcom format.    The DVD set has commentaries on every episode, all of which are both entertaining and enlightening. The physical material of the set isn't extensive but the packaging shows the same attention to detail and marriage to the storylines of the series that the show's set designers and prop makers exhibit (a fact which is pointed out on the commentaries).

0061730335|5.0|William Kamkwamba's story is one of intense motivation and proof that with enthusiasm and ingenuity one can achieve great things.  It takes little time for the reader to become both very comfortable and very fond of William.  His stories are alluring and direct the reader through a world of hazards, hunger, and hope. His life could not be any more different than mine but his message could not be more important to my generation.  William found himself in the middle of a famine and his family's eyes gazing at him for a solution, and there's no question from where his motivation arose.    His immense imagination was matched with the scientific method which when coupled together provided him with the ideas and concepts that resulted in great fruition.  No longer does the word `impossible' hold value after reading Williams story.  He shows us that more things are more capable now then have ever been.  With the correct mixture of motivation, imagination, and the scientific method, real hope can emerge and great things can be accomplished.   This is his lesson and it cannot go unheard.

B000003FMY|5.0|I confess I'm a sucker for the LIVING STEREO series -- it has never disappointed me.  This Russian sampler by Fritz Reiner is a perfect example of the series.  It features a top-notch conductor and orchestra, beautiful music, and superb recording standards.  But with this one it's the details that win my heart, and Fritz Reiner is just the guy to capture those details.  I noticed this with another great LIVING STEREO recording, his performance of \\"The Pines Of Rome\\" (featured in the \\"Buy All Three\\" discount section on this page -- I recommend you take the deal).  My impression is that Reiner loves the individual instruments as much as he loves the orchestra.  Somehow he manages to showcase these individuals while still presenting a beautiful cohesive whole.  This is particularly evident in track 7, \\"Bydlo,\\" an affectionate-yet-majestic portrait of an ox drawing a huge cart down a dirt track.  It actually brings tears to my eyes when I hear it.  It's my favorite piece on an album that's gorgeous from start to finish.<br /><br />You'll notice that even the less-than-glowing reviews of this album give it 4 stars.  One of the reviewers also mentions a break-neck pace for \\"Night On Bald Mountain.\\"  Reiner's tempo for this piece is a little faster than I prefer it too, but I like it anyway.  This is one of those albums that wins new fans to the classical genre, and satisfies old ones too.

With just a small change in our diets, workouts, and frame of thought, we all can achieve superhuman results.  10 years of documented experiments and a lifetime of study, this book is the \\"less traveled path\\" of a minimalist approach to working out in order to achieve personal bests.  The studies are detailed and the life stories are great.  This is a must read for anyone who wants to achieve that first level of fitness or the next level of fitness.  All I can say is read it and I dare anyone to try it.
B003UESJH4|4.0|There always seems to come a time in every British actors career where they must play the role of a historical British monarch. Riding on the success of his career defining performance in \\"A Single Man\\" and sampling the glory of Best Actor nominations across the award circuits, Colin Firth comes storming back with another film, determined, this time, to take the all the prizes with him too. But is \\"The King's Speech\\" worth its pre-Oscar hype?  Set across the years between the First and Second World War, \\"The King's Speech\\" concentrates on the rise of King George VI (Firth) and his personal woes, including his infamous stammer and disdain for public speaking. Obviously being royalty, having an ability to engage the public in moving and inspirational speeches tends to be a necessity of the job. In attempting to overcome this disability, he's entrusted in the care of the eccentric and flamboyant speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush).  Over the course of the film, the two men of distinctly different social classes come to blows but ultimately forge a friendship which will last a lifetime.  Colin Firth's portrayal of George VI (or simply Bertie to his family and friends) was a fascinating insight into the king's troubled personal life. His tragic inability to speak, both in public and to his family, was also tender and, in a way, heart-warmingly humbling.  While Firth will deservedly get the plaudits for his regal starring role, it was Geoffrey Rush's witty, genuine, off-the-wall performance as Logue which personally blew me away, with immense comic timing and inability to be overwhelmed while in the presence of his most prestigious client.  The supporting cast was littered with enough real quality to make any award body take notice, and make most audiences marvel in delight.  The graceful and articulate Helen Bonham Carter gives a honest and loving performance as the late Queen Mother, Elizabeth.  Michael Gambon is sharp and somewhat intimidating as Bertie's father, King George V. Guy Pearce is arrogantly brilliant as Firth's brother and predecessor, King Edward VIII.  While the excellent Timothy Spall shone once again, in his second portrayal as the great Winston Churchill (his first was in October's god awful stop animation, Jackboots on Whitehall). It was also a pleasure to see the classy Jennifer Ehle - who starred opposite Firth in, perhaps, his most famous role as Mr Darcy in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice - as Lionel's wife.  Hooper should also be credited for making a visually engaging period drama, which never once felt tired or dull on the eyes, as a lot of these quintessentially British affairs can so often become.  The film's themes are also an uplifting and enjoyable treat for all; a story of friendship between essentially a prince and a pauper, a man's journey to overcome his own personal adversaries and become the king he was born to be.  Yes we won't lie, this isn't original by any means: these are classic tried and tested formulas that transcends cinema of the ages - but rarely to this level of detail and panache.  Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush's performances make \\"The King's Speech\\" an enthralling journey which is heart-warming, humorous and genuinely sincere.  Highly recommended.  Andrew Moore  **** 1/2

030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss offers himself as a guinea pig, testing many alternative and revolutionary theories for how to get the most out of the human body.  For me, it was very reminiscent of the ethos of 4-Hour Work Week, essentially utilizing the 20/80 Pareto principle.  I have since 4HWK loved Tim's writing style, which is sort of a \\"no bs\\" straight forward approach to drawing you in, and then stating in beautifully simplistic terms how to get to where you ultimately want to be.  I finished the book in two sittings.  I would highly recommend 4 Hour Body, as a no nonsense guide to hacking the human body and ultimately, getting the most out of life (performance wise).
030746363X|5.0|After losing 35 pounds on the simple diet plan that Tim posted on his blog a year or two ago, I knew that he was onto something. Like his previous book, (the 4 Hour Work Week, which also changed my life/career and my approach to it), this book entails a complete approach to the subject matter, truly starting at the beginning. \\"Why do you want to do this? What are the simple steps that will help you make progress, and motivate you to continue? What do you have to lose by not trying vs. what do you have to lose by making a few simple and small changes?\\"    This book isn't a magic bullet, but it can certainly put you on the path to finding your own magic bullet, or \\"Harajuku Moment\\" as he mentions in the book. There's something in here for everyone, and although some of the claims may seem extraordinary when distilled in the title, in reality the only thing extraordinary about them is that no one has distilled these important, amazing facts so eloquently until now.    I know that the title and the approach is laced with clever marketing, but if it helps to get this useful information into the hands of more people who really need it, it's more than forgivable.
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|then you never listened to Kid Rock.  He never does the same album twice...ever!  And this one is no exception.  So, Kid Rock fans enjoy his versatility, his song writing skills, and his ability to make great music regardless of genre.  This isn't my favorite Rock album, but it's still been on my constant playlist since it dropped in stores.  Plus, he finally created something I can play in front of my kids without having to explain some of his colorful terminology.  Thanks Rock. Good stuff.      I wonder where he's going to go from here.  Whatever direction it is, I'm sure he'll irritate old fans, find some new ones, and I'll just hang out and listen.
B004C5M282|5.0|This CD is fantastic especially the track with Barney from Napalm Death. To me Volbeat is a mix of Social Distortion, The Misfits and Metallica.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|Hollywood (and elsewhere) has given up many interpretations of Arthur Conan Doyle's master detective (and ace companion, Doctor Watson) since the time of the acerbic, arch, understated Basil Rathbone days along with a bumbling Doctor Watson in the 1930s. Since then, depending on the times, he has been everything from a \\"hippie\\" dope fiend to the the present protean man performance by Robert Downey, Junior. In an age when every action film has to meet the Iron Man comic book standard, or better, it is, apparently, no longer possible to portray the magi of Baker Street as a stay-at-home bookish intellectual and mere man of scientific deduction. He must now also be the avenging angel (and old Doc as well), well versed in the martial arts and other forms of self-defense against the criminal element and in this film the besieged British Empire.     Now normally I would not review this kind of film, although I am always happy to watch anything that Robert Downey, Junior has a part in. He is just a very interesting actor to watch in the line of Humphrey Bogart, Paul Newman, Jeff Bridges and the like. I, of course, thrilled to Conan Doyle's stories ever since grade school where the teacher recited aloud Hounds of The Baskervilles to us. And I have read plenty of his other stories but usually the story line is nothing worthy of comment. This one, however, is slightly different.     Our finely-honed and alert pair in this caper are trying fend off the attempts by one Lord Blackburn to create an evil (of course) world-wide Empire and take control of the world's resources. Hey, wait a minute this is mid-19th century England where the Britain Empire ruled the waves. Hello, that was the evil empire. Just ask the average India peasant or those in about fifty other places. And the way the evil Lord intended to reign (poor old Victoria be damned) is through what appears to be something like a \\"Rump\\" Parliament that seems to have some historic reflection back to Oliver Cromwell's times. Now I know the British monarchy and its myriad supporters never got over that \\"interloper's\\" transgressions but this is sublime, indeed. Naturally, the ever-hovering background presence of evil incarnate, Professor Moriarty, is wovened into the plot as well. So you can see what I have taken the time to write up a couple of sentences to review this film.     But here is my real problem with the story line. Now, traditionally, old Sherlock is not known, to be enamored of the ladies, although not a few have swooned over him. No time for that stuff, old boy, right? Here though he seems to have a certain feeling for one very fetching villainess, and he coyly leaves her own devices. So what if she was Professor Moriarty's agent. I told you she was fetching, real fetching. In the parlance of the spy game you could have \\"turned\\" her into a double agent. Sherlock wake up.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|None of my friends like this movie, but that's mainly because they all have the IQ of a rock. Getting a free rental of this movie from amazon was a plus. Came in a timely manner, packaging intact, all the discs work and play well. Amazing movie, definitely one of my favorites of all time.
0812550706|5.0|I will add my 2 cents to all the other reviews. Hard book to put down. I am not fond of sci-fi books but I do love good sci-fi movies -- of which there are too few of.     Ender's Game is more than a sci-fi book. It's a great read.
030746363X|4.0|I bought the book based on listening to the abridged audio-book. There is definitely some useful info in here, for me the nutrition stuff was a fresh approach and the low carb (rebranded paleo) approach has helped me in its initial phase. I like other reviewers found the name-dropping, star f*&ker stuff pretty hilarious and kinda cute. But hey that's how the precious dweebs of the SF Peninsula roll.    The sex section only covers new ground if you have had your head in the ground for you whole adult life.    All that said there is a LOT of good info and reference in this book. If you look at it as a reference manual and not a book then you get it. It is not a lifestyle manifesto but a series of pointers. For my money if I find 3 truly useful things and I have its worth it.    Take the hype with a grain of salt but I bet you find something instantly applicable to your life in here.
0810993139|5.0|I got this book as a gift for my little cousin for Christmas last year and he loved it. He read the book very quickly and moved on to the other books in the series. I recommend getting it for young readers in your life because it makes them excited to read.
1416972250|5.0|This is one of the few series I have read in years that has completely blown me away. The world that has been created is amazing, and the characters are craftier with incredible skill. The world is believable, and the one we might actually live in and just not be aware of it. The battles between good and evil are epic, but one of the things that makes this series so good, is it explores the areas of life that are grey, neither black nor white. It explores feelings and emotions even when they are difficult.<br /><br />This book continues almost immediately after book 2, City of Ashes, the battle between the Shadowhunters and Valentine . Valentine is intent on cleansing the Shadowhunters and destroying all down worlders. This is another great book in a marvelous series.

B003NFM3JU|5.0|You most certainly will not be disappointed in Jim Carrey's performance at all. I was expecting an over the top performance, aka \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\".  Truthfully, if you did not know he was the lead in this movie, you would not even recognize that he is the iconic fabled Ebineezer Scrooge. I honestly believe that this version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" will soon become a Christmas classic. The 3d format takes this movie to a far superior home viewing experience.
0060555661|4.0|This is the bible for the indivdual small investor. My copy is highlighted and full of notes. I read and read it again and again. However dated, the Intelligent Investor simplifies investing down to a few basics. It is managing fear and greed. It is exhaustively researching the company and the balance sheet. You learn to grasp the concept of owning the company and its assests vs speculating by renting the stock. It is patience to stick by your choices. It really boils down to junior high math and adult decisions when facing emotions. If you look at the family tree of Graham... aka the Super Investors of Graham and Doddsville (Buffett, Schloss, Knapp, among others) each had at their DNA core the principals of Graham but grew to be different in many respects. I highly endorse the book as a core foundation to any investment library.

B003ZK58WM|4.0|So I found out about this book by looking at what was popular on the Kindle. I also saw this book on the shelf at many stores, and thought the premise of it was very interesting. I really enjoyed how it switched from person to person, and there were many different view points. I really loved this book, then about half way through, I felt it started to get a little tired. Some of the characters just began doing things that were basically repeats from the first half of the book. There were certain characters whose chapters I really enjoyed reading. However, once the story jumped back to Lev, I quickly lost interest. Really, I wondered how many times Lev would do something completely idiotic and wind up in trouble, only to charm his way out of it. After the first couple times, it wasn't funny or charming anymore, it was just annoying.<br /><br />Rather than having the defining traits of a character make him more interesting, the repetition made the characters look more flat than anything...<br /><br />That said, I really enjoyed the book as a whole. I feel it should have been a little shorter because of some of the redundancies in it, but I am really looking forward to the next two books which will complete the trilogy. Follett included a lot of good, historical information and many of the characters in the book tied in nicely with it. I definitely recommend it, and I hope that the next two books only improve!<br /><br />Unrelated to the actual content of the book, it's a complete sham that the Kindle price is higher than buying a physical copy of the book. The print edition is HUGE, and the Kindle edition is just data... There's NO reason for the Kindle edition to be more expensive, or even the same price.

0307272702|5.0|This is a solid and comprehensive book reviewing the science behind Low-Carb and why it works and also how to follow it (although Traubes' version is a bit different - but essentially the same at the core).<br /><br />Although other people have mentioned that they found \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" to be dull, I did not find it dull, and was excited to read Gary Traubes' latest book.<br /><br />While this is a great book and much easier to read, I found that it was not all that helpful to someone already familiar with the Atkins' Diet and who read Taubes' other book.  I felt like this was his second attempt to position his book to a broader audience and make it more accessible.<br /><br />I give the book 5 stars because I can't think of a more accessible and informative introduction to law carb.  I'm not going to judge the book negatively simply because I happen to have read other books too.  I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone curious about this approach and wanting to learn why and how it works.  It's great for someone starting out. That said, if you're not looking for an introduction and are already familiar with low carb, this book doesn't offer a whole lot beyond what you already know.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Works perfect. Also the narrow plug on the 800 side is perfect on the MacBook pro because some plugs tend to be fat/oversized and do not allow for neighboring plugs to be inserted. Plus the 5 inch reach of this adapter makes it easy to swap out different firewire devises, without stressing the firewire port on the MacBook Pro.
030746363X|5.0|This book was an interesting read for sure. It was a collection of so many different and surprising topics.

I do think his approach to a low carb diet is much more feasible to stay on long term. I am always a fan of the big cheat day on the weekends so that is working too. I was carb cycling before seeing his method and I am going to give it a go. There are so many new things a person could take from this book and apply in their life.

B002ZG99N6|4.0|THE TOWN, the title refers to Charlestown, a section of Boston infamous for the crime and criminals who hail from that area, and Director, Actor, and Co-Writer (with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) Ben Affleck knows this area well as is evident in not only the  accents of all of his characters but also in the choices of locations for this fast moving bank heist drama.  Affleck knows how to bring out the best in his cast of superb actors - never forgetting that despite the crusty surfaces of his people their lies beneath a bruised psyche.<br /><br />Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) leads a gang of bank robbers - James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Gloansy Magloan (Slaine), Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) - carrying off a series of successful heists dressed in costumes to conceal their identity, laundering their stolen money at the guidance of florist Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite) in a manner that eludes the police.  During one of their heists they take a hostage, the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) whom they release after the heist. Knowing that she may inform the FBI Doug decides to makes friends with her  but instead of assuring his fellow gang that she will not be a problem Doug instead falls for her.  The FBI - Frawley (Jon Hamm) and Dino (Titus Welliver) - remain hot on the gang's trail, attempting to get information from Doug's old girlfriend Krista (Blake Lively, in a breakout performance!).  Doug is conflicted and thinks of leaving the gang so that he won't end up like his father (Chris Cooper) who is in jail, but James is the baddy here and demands the gang stay together for at least one last major heist. A schism arises between Doug and Claire and uncovers a deep scar from Doug's past. From that point on through the end of the film the story is filled with conflicts, chases, the gang's outwitting the FBI and Boston police, all with the gang's penchant for changing disguises frequently.  The  ending is full of surprises.<br /><br />Though not a great movie, THE TOWN is far better a film than many that are gaining award nominations.  One of the reasons is the tight ensemble work by this surprisingly fine cast who together give us a slice of Boston we'll not forget. Well worth watching.  Grady Harp, December 10a film than many that are gaining award nominations.

0739384198|5.0|I had anticipated a slower novel than the previous one, rife with endless, dry court scenes and Lisbeth in the hospital or jail.  Not so.  As before, I was riveted by the complex plot and multitude of fascinating characters.  The narration by Vance is perfect for this book.  It is difficult to envision what Larsson had planned for the fourth book in this series as this one wrapped up so well.  Perhaps his long-time woman friend will finally work a deal to release the mostly completed fourth book in Lisbeth's journey (that is reportedly residing in her laptop).

We are led to see his closeness to the stock market world as a once happy marriage turning into a nightmare of treason  and filthy games.  i am facinated by lawrence's personnal attachment to this world of finance he eagerly wants to be part of. This attachment reflects  a compelling atonement to the glory and success of the financial world and human disappointment when he acknowledges the failure and fraudulent actions beneath the surface of his world. This dichotomy renders the story complete and convincing.

B002JVWR9U|2.0|I bought this during amazon's black friday event without knowing anything about it.  The good news is that it was cheap, so I don't feel terribly slighted.      The bad news: I see why it was so inexpensive.  Yes, there's lots of taut early-20s flesh on screen, some interesting set designs and occasional snappy dialog, but that doesn't hide the recycled ideas shamelessly stolen from other sources.  Nor does any of this succeed in distracting from the obvious plot developments and waiting \\"surprises.\\"    I suppose one could argue this series is meant as a tongue-in-cheek parody in the vein of Snakes On A Plane/The Expendables/RED, but The Vampire Diaries utterly fails to make such a case.  It's just plain bad and best passed up.

B001R88C6I|5.0|If you are longing for something that is NOT a Vampire or Werewolf and maybe NOT blowing something up in outer space, BUT STILL would like an edgy Sci-Fi drama....you may have found the right place to enjoy one.  Originally, this was released on DVD and like other similar movies, like Dark City, received mediocre reviews at best. It also shares the same issues of \\"What would you classify it as just not only being one type but adding a mystery and love interest twist to it as many do now that Sci-Fi has changed over the years to keep our interest.  The Screen play was very well done as it is easy to follow this story line. Sometimes there are little visual points in the show that they go to and you get into a rhythm of where they might be lurking to be picked up..very interesting as well as a high entertainment factor.  For instance, a scene changes from what you would think is the present time, like 2010, to a period in the late 1920s and the production company really makes you believe it could actually happen the way the story is being shown.  The details are flawless and later in the special feature, they explain how they added soft CGI to get the effects that, to Me, DID Nail this completely together...a great job!  The Video and Audio did gain good improvements color correction and effects; sound stage and placement was well refined and detailed in the loss less domain. good transfer over the DVD and well worth the cost even if you already own the DVD to purchase the Blu-ray.  As with many that have got into this offering, they all tell me they must see it more than once and wonder how these get under the radar types keep coming out for our enjoyment. If you like Dark City, you may like this one too (A little less fantasy)  So please don't pass this bargain up unless you're only looking at Missile Command for substance.
B000WBZZ48|5.0|Die Hard is not 'your typical action film'. No way. And anyone who would view it as such really ought to stick with Twilight and Narnia.<br /><br />In the Sixties, author Roderick Thorp wrote a novel, [[ASIN:0848803752 The Detective]], which was turned into a movie, starring Frank Sinatra in the title role of Joe Leland. A sequel, [[ASIN:0345287819 Nothing Lasts Forever]]. was written, in which Joe becomes trapped in the Claxxon Oil Corporation skyscraper after it is taken over by German terrorists and he has to rescue his daughter and grandchildren. Two decades later, the skyscraper becomes Nakatomi, the daughter becomes the wife, Leland becomes John McClane and the title becomes Die Hard.<br /><br />To say that Die Hard sets new standards for action movies is like calling Bill Gates modestly wealthy. The movie was so innovative and groundbreaking that dozens of rip-offs followed - Passenger 57, Under Siege, Cliffhanger, Sudden Death, et al. Hostage/terrorist movies were all the rage in the early Nineties.<br /><br />Very few came close, because Die Hard had so many strong points, not least of which was Alan Rickman's cold performance, as Hans Gruber - also the name of the villain in Our Man Flint - the classically educated, smartly dressed terrorist leader. This is not some hammy guy in a chain-mail shirt with a Freddy Mercury mustache. Gruber would have been well at home on Wall Street.<br /><br />His plan is to break into the vault on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Plaza and take away $640million in negotiable bearer bonds. When he and his 12 European henchmen round up the office workers, who are enjoying a Christmas Eve party, one man slips away unnoticed. He is John McClane, a New York cop who has come to LA to settle down with his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). The odds are against him. But that's just the way he likes it.<br /><br />The terrorists even have names. And we remember them. Most action movies these days have unidentified heavies, played by stunt men, who are lined up and knocked over.<br /><br />In his battle to save his Holly, McClane is scorched, torched, beaten and blown up. He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and double-cross and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police, who are unable to get inside, and even less from the FBI.<br /><br />McClane is not a supercop. He is an ordinary guy, who doesn't want a fight.

If you are a big Michael Jackson fan you will love his latest work. R.I.P. Michael Jackson.
B000TGCR3S|3.0|This film is about two street kids Black and White who live in the rundown Treasure Town. Black, the oldest of the boys spend his time taking care of White and beating up anyone endangering his city. Soon the young boys life are disrupted when a Yakuza gang moves in and tries to take over the city. Things are complicated further when the Yakuza brings in a strange looking and brutal man who may be an alien. The story of this movie however is not about the Yakusa, or about aliens or even about White's seaming psychic abilities, it is about the relationship between these two boys, and how the world looks more interesting when one are a child.<br /><br />I found the story to artsy for my tastes, also it is very uneven, at some points it is a slice of life depicting the lives of two street children, then it is science fiction with aliens, then we are in a gangster film and then we have a Spiritual battle for one of the character's soul. The movies is all over the place, some might like this, I do not. The characters however are well made, one start to care about these characters, and everyone, including supporting characters are given a distinctive personality and a unique look.<br /><br />The animation of this film is very good, the film obviously have high production value and everything moves, not like in many anime where only the character's lips moves most of the time. The scenes are very detailed and while I personally did not care for the art style and found the movie frankly to be quite ugly I have to take my hat off to the animators as the movie is skillfully made.<br /><br />I watched the movie with Japanese dialog and English subtitles, I was not impressed, the actors all sounded monotone. The dub might be better I do not know, but the sub at least was not good enough to carry such complex and involving characters.<br /><br />Personally I did not like this film. I think that the movie was far to long, it moved very uneven with long sections where nothing happens and a very confusing storyline. I however have to give the movie credit for being well made, for having great characters and for being a little different compared to most anime movies.ne.

It is a powerful study. It gives information on how to lose weight and improve your overall health.  When I started to read, I did not want to put the book down.
1439107955|5.0|Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, a professor of medicine at Columbia University and a rising star in the field of cancer biology, is the author of this excellent story of cancer from antiquity to the present day, which was selected as one of The 10 Best Books of 2010 by The New York Times and is my personal selection for the best nonfiction book I have read this year.<br /><br />Mukherjee begins the book with the story of Carla Reed, a young kindergarten teacher and mother, who has been ill with vague symptoms for the last month and awakens one day with an ominous sense that something serious is wrong with her. She sees her physician and requests blood work to determine the cause of her illness. The following morning her world is turned completely upside down, as she learns that the complete blood count drawn in the office is highly suggestive of acute leukemia. She is admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital, as she leaves the world of the healthy and enters the realm of the SICK, as technicians, phlebotomists, nurses and doctors swarm to her bedside to ask questions and perform tests. Later that morning she meets Dr. Mukherjee, who oversees her care and shares her story throughout this book.<br /><br />The story of cancer begins in ancient Egypt, as the famed physician Imhotep describes a malady that presents as \\"a bulging mass in the breast\\" amongst other medical conditions. Imhotep provides therapeutic remedies for the other illnesses, but for the breast mass he writes, \\"There is none.\\" The first definitive treatment of breast cancer occurs centuries later in Persia, as Queen Atossa's cancerous breast is surgically removed by a slave in the first recorded mastectomy, performed without the benefit of anesthesia or antisepsis.<br /><br />The history of cancer is intimately linked to the history of medicine, and the reader learns about the different types of solid cancers and leukemias as they are understood in the context of history, first as an imbalance in one of the body's four humors, and then as an abnormal proliferation of cells distinct in appearance from normal ones. Mukherjee skillfully portrays the important medical and scientific researchers as sleuths who independently and collaboratively attempt to track down an elusive killer, while also describing the lives of former patients including \\"Jimmy\\", the Boston youth whose story inspired millions of Americans to donate to cancer research through The Jimmy Fund, and private citizens such as Mary Lasker, a New York socialite whose tireless efforts transformed the moribund American Society for the Control of Cancer to the powerful and influential American Cancer Society.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the benefits of most of these advances in medical knowledge throughout most of the 20th century are short lived in most cases, as the majority of patients suffered relapses and recurrences. Mukherjee portrays the despair felt by patients, their families and cancer researchers, contrasted with the hope that significant decreases in cancer mortality would eventually be achieved, through medical research and therapies and, more importantly, from advancements in early diagnostic techniques and in prevention of risk factors such as smoking and excess consumption of alcohol.<br /><br />The last quarter of the book describes the advances in cancer biology as it is understood on the molecular level to be a disease of uncontrolled cellular growth due to the effect of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Mukherjee leaves us with hope for the future of the treatment of cancer, as it will likely be either curable or a relatively easily treatable chronic disease.<br /><br />I found \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" to be as compelling as a well written mystery novel, one filled with interesting characters and unexpected plot twists, along with interesting and understandable discussions of science and medicine. Dr. Mukherjee has done a masterful job in writing this book, and I would highly recommend it to all readers.

0307704610|2.0|This review applies ONLY to the ABRIDGED AUDIO BOOK version available on CD and through Audible. Please note that Amazon combines the reviews for all forms of media (book, kindle e-book, audiobook, etc.)    There is a huge amount of information missing from the abridged audiobook version. The audiobook does say it's abridged, but the description goes on to detail the topics that are covered. Many of these promised topics are NOT contained in audiobook.     Missing info includes: Reaching Genetic Potential in 6 months, Running 50K in 12 weeks, Sleeping 2 Hours Per Day, Reverse Permanent Injuries, Add 150 Lbs to Lift in 6 Months, Pay For Beach Vacation w/ Hospital Visit.    It's not just the product description; the content of the audiobook contradicts itself as well. The reader says \\"more on this subject later\\", but then the topic turns out to be omitted. This seems to indicate rushed and poor quality production.    I'm sure the unabridged book is great. And this rating would have many more stars if not for the false advertising of missing information. The author Tim Ferriss seems to have quite a bit of attention to detail, but I'm guessing he wasn't all that involved in the audiobook. Too bad.    Now I'm trying to decide if it's worth the investment to purchase this book yet again but in a different format. I feel like I wasted my money the first time around.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Westerfeld knows how to connect with his readers and make you not want to put his work down for a second.  I read this book in two days, and I couldn't believe it.  It was jam-packed with action and I felt that every other page there was some kind of hook to keep me wondering what was going to happen next.  I definitely recommend this book to teenagers and adults alike!
B003VS0CX8|4.0|The quality the scene( views of the mountains) at the beginning is not very good but overall a must have if you like this movie and don't want to buy the limited edition.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I bought the first season on black Friday for only $13 without having ever seen the show before. I thought I'd give it a go. I'm a 28 year old female, so I was a bit worried at first that this might be more for teenagers, but I must say, I LOVE The Vampire Diaries. The story is intriguing and the acting is amazing (Ian Somerhalder does such an amazing job playing the bad guy). True Blood to me always seemed like HBO's way of showcasing vampire porn. So it's nice to have a series that is enjoyable to watch without all the unnecessary junk, but has a good plot. Best $13 I've ever spent on a black Friday !

B004G6009K|5.0|It's great to see Disney return to what works for them. If you liked Little Mermaid or Beauty & the Beast, this movie will be one that you will definitely want to own. One of the characters is a horse named Maximus. My 4yr old grand daughter was belly laughing at this horse. If Disney marketing is smart, they will sell this horse as a toy, just like Bullseye. Disney had departed away from this style of cartoon after B&B and I'm glad they returned.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|If you like traditional Christmas music, you'll love this album. If you like Annie Lennox, you ought to love this album, too. If you can imagine Annie Lennox doing traditional Christmas music in her own inimitable way, and if you've enjoyed her most recent albums, then nothing here should surprise you.<br /><br />Some reviewers have absolutely trashed this album, insisting that Lennox's voice is shot. They've awarded the album one star and used words like \\"grating,\\" \\"screeching\\" \\"strained,\\" and \\"processed\\" to describe her singing. Two reviewers claim to have thrown the album straight into the trash. I'm not sure if they're listening to the same album I'm hearing, because Lennox's vocals sound just like they've always sounded to me. If anything, her tone may have deepened over the years, but as far as I can tell she certainly hasn't lost her chops. I think I'm being objective when I say that Lennox's singing is as powerful and as haunting on this album as it's ever been. As for the musical arrangements, I think she manages to stay reverent and appropriate to the material without compromising her own signature sound.<br /><br />I can only guess that certain listeners are disappointed that Lennox would record these traditional Christian carols in favor of the secular material for which she's best known. One reviewer boldly claims that Lennox's original compositions \\"far surpass the quality of the compositions she has chosen for A Christmas Cornucopia.\\" Is he referring to time-honored classics like \\"Silent Night\\" or \\"The First Noel?\\" Another reviewer claims to have enjoyed only the secular \\"Universal Child,\\" Lennox's sole original composition on A Christmas Cornucopia--and, in my opinion, a forgettable piece by Lennox's high standards. Of course these reviewers are free to their opinions, but, assuming they read the song titles and knew what they were buying, I have to wonder why they ordered the album in the first place.<br /><br />If you buy this album expecting to hear traditional Christmas carols sung by Annie Lennox in an Annie Lennox style, I can't see how you could possibly be disappointed.
0061730335|5.0|Early in the novel, William shows his determination to learn.  His zeal develops and grows for understanding, manipulating, and eventually creating technical devices. He displays respectable qualities of character. William is not afraid of failure.  He tries numerous times and different approaches to achieve his goals. William also does let himself be stifled by what others think of him or his goals.         This book also vividly describes what it is like to live through poverty and famine.  William had to struggle to survive, along with many of the people of Malawi in the famine of 2001 to 2002.  Reading this can be a call to action, inspiring one to find out more to help people of the world who are in extreme need, when crises such as this occur. This section of the book is also a testament to William's fortitude and perseverance.
B004CAWKXE|2.0|This album as a whole is garbage, even with a few good songs.  Someone needs to tell MCR that they aren't Queen, they aren't Bowie, they aren't Aerosmith, they certainly aren't Angels and Airwaves crap that is 'Summertime', fans don't want an \\"all-star\\" album of their favorite influences or a producer's vision of what a good selling album sounds like in 2010.  A fan of MCR wants an MCR album.  Go ahead and listen to Three Cheers and tell me who it sounds like.  Sounds like f'in nothing.  That's why it's brilliant.  Black Parade?  Well, they got some songs that are derivations, but they pulled them off very well, so that's ok in my book.  This album?  The first time I heard it, I felt like I heard it before.  It's like bands have nothing left after 3 albums so they make these cheesy 'influence' albums.  Also, gotta love that 'Sing' and 'Na Na Na' have already been used in NFL, American Idol and Rhapsody commercials.  Maybe that tells you all you need to know.  This reminds me more and more of Muse.  A totally, completely original band that seems to have run out of inspiration and can only make songs that sound like Queen or Audioslave or System of a Down.  Plus they advertise for everything now too.  But this isn't a review of Muse. So I'll stop there.    Anyway, I guess I should state that I understand why MCR made this record.  After touring for so long with the Black Parade, they deserve to have a good time and make songs that are happy and cheesy and dancy, I guess.  It just doesn't make for an enjoyable album for me.  They didn't push themselves at all to put this out.    I would like to point out that I feel the writing is actually pretty good.  So I'll give Way credit for that.  I always had the feeling that Frank was the truly musical one in the group, so I'd have to blame him for letting the producer take us through some of the crap and synth that are in these songs.  Lastly, I blame the whole band for thinking they could get away on making a whole album without a true drummer.  They popped in different drummers for different songs and you hear some of the lamest, straightest drumming with no emotion, no creativity.  And don't get me started on the DJ thing.  I mean, really? Really? A DJ spouting off nonsense?  That's how you want continuity in an album?    Finally, I just want to point out that I'm not asking for MCR to put out another Black Parade or another Three Cheers or another Bullets.  I understand wanting to go in a different direction, but it's like they hardly tried here.  Maybe the band Brand New has actually ruined everything for me by creating 4 completely different albums that all sound like Brand New (listen to Seventy Times 7 (2000), Degausser (2005), Sink (2008) - same structure with dynamics and putting the 'hook' in the bridge, but oh so different sounding).
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. In fact, it might just be best animated movie of the year for me - narrowly beat out [[ASIN:B002ZG97Z6 How to Train Your Dragon (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Dragon Double Pack) [Blu-ray]]]. Its those adorable little yellow guys, and the hilarity they bring to the movie!    It struck me recently that this is a bit like a nondenominational holiday-free rewriting of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Gru, our Grinch, starts out all villain and tiny-hearted. He gets into a competition with a newer, younger villain called Vector that the bank has decided to fund instead of him. As part of a nefarious plan to steal back a device Vector took, Gru fakes an adoption of three little girls. He just doesn't count on those little girls capturing his heart! And maybe his heart did grow three sizes that day =) Is there a new hero in town?    This movie has something for everyone. It has a great story, and lots of fun and funny moments. Gru's minions are so cute I would just love a horde of them for myself! Plus, you just can't beat the BluRay/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Pack deal. I saw it in 3D in theaters, which was entertaining, and have watched it over and over since it finally released. Its so much fun!! =)

B003UERZ88|5.0|Uh.. this is like the real Priest not when they tried to turn thrash. The best of Priest should not include Jugulator or that crap they spewed out to sell records. If you like melody and call and return guitar riffs this is good...if you want screaming vocals to a bad beat go somewhere else. I am happy to have bought this, I like Fight,too but apparently there are some kids out there that just don't get it. Trash my review.. but I thought it was true to the legacy of British Steel...Sad Wings of Destiny.. and Stained Class..considering a video review.. good stuff
B003RO1NUC|1.0|Never got MnM and there is no way this album is any where near How I Got Over. The Roots should be number 1 of 2010.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Tom Cruise and Charlize Theron were the original leads, thank God this did not happen. I have not seen a movie that I've loved in a long time. Romance, mystery, humor, and class are the foundation of this breath taking cinema. I wish all movies could be this spectacular!
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this because I was afraid it was going to be campy....like a very sad \\"Dukes Of Hazard\\" movie tribute to the eighties series...well let me tell you I couldn't have been more wrong...\\"The A-Team\\" movie was nothing short of a wild ride with JATO rockets strapped on for good measure.  Never a dull moment...and Jessica Biel well what can I say...shes the kind of woman that makes you stammer seeing a picture of her shes that hot...but I digress...If I were you, and I was, I would spend the 2 hours and 4 bucks, which I did, for a truly entertaining evening, and it was, with great acting off the charts completely ridiculous action sequences and a Plan that truly came together...    As a note...for a previous reviewer...don't be a schmuck and give a bad review to a movie because the service providing it failed...what are you 12...suck it up there Happy Feet....grab your sippy cup and get yourself a kool-aid refill you'll feel much better...and next time perhaps you could try customer support with the rest of the adults and not throw a tantrum cuz sissy took your rattle...    to everyone else sorry for the rant    I have never reviewed a movie before \\"The A-Team\\" but this movie was not only great it more then exceeded my expectations...motivating me to take the extra time to not only review the movie but also chastise a tool for misrepresenting it...    See the movie you won't be disappointed.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|GOOD JOB MASTERPIECE THEATRES!!!!!!!!<br />This is a WONDERFUL movie that has clear messages teaching about good morals within the main characters.<br />Also, it exposes the shallowness of self centered living. We would rate it G(general) if not for the things listed below.<br /><br />HOWEVER-We would rate a few very short bloody scenes PG-13 because of a few murders (which involve the villan), and an after-the-fact suicide scene.<br />The only other problem that we find with it is era immodesty (no nudity, but very low cut exposed cleaveage) and brief era language(ex. omg - damn-good lord----no modern curse words))<br /><br />If you enjoyed this, please check out these other 'MASTERPIECE THEATRE' movies:<br />Jayne Eyre<br />David Copperfield<br />Bleak House<br />Cranford<br />Kidnapped<br />Emma<br />Carries War
B0036TGSIK|4.0|This was a good movie. Really Emma Stone's tone of voice is what makes the movie so much better than all the shallow highschool movies. She takes the satire to a different level and actually makes you think about what's really going on in the plot. I'd watch it again.
B001IBIQU6|2.0|I've genuinely enjoyed all albums post-Construction.  Except for this one. I really wanted to like it. Overall, I thought it was too atmospheric, and didn't have enough content to keep me interested. I fully support their progression into a new sound/exploring musical styles, and I LOVED Playing the Angel. I just think they missed the mark here.
B004BLTNJI|5.0|This movie, yes is a little creepy.  It has a moral, which is the point.  The grass is always greener on the other side.  The moral is the grass is not always greener and things are not always what they seem.  I watched this with our 12 year old daughter. She was fine with it.  Not sure that a child of 10 or younger would understand it.  We love this movie.  The person who commented about the 3D effects is wrong.  They must have watched that non Blu-Ray 3D, with the paper glasses.  This is the version for 3D TV's and Blu-Ray players.
1932100660|5.0|This book simply shocked me.  I am not any kind of specialist about nutrition or medical science.  But over my several decades of life have tried to pay attention to what is a healthy diet.  I enjoy locally grown (including in my own back yard) vegetables and happy healthy meats and dairy from local organic farms.  But this book set me back on my heels.  It turns upside down everything i have been told during my adult life, especially about protein.  Recently I was berating my son for not getting his kids to eat meat, on the basis that they absolutely must have animal protein in order to grow, develop good brains and muscles, etc etc.    And, for a concentrated attempt at weight loss I have been following the much-approved Mayo Clinic Diet.  which lumps together protein and dairy in their food pyramid.    Every parent should read this book.  Certainly dietitians and nutritionists should read it.  It is amazing to me the extent to which our ideas about health and nutrition have been controlled by industry groups such as dairy, cattle, and corn industries.  Of course I know that industry tries to influence what the government tells us about diet and health, but i had no idea of how extreme this has been.  Campbell tells it straight from his own personal experience as a scientist.

It delivers all that it Promises.This set is so big that it is like layers of a onion and you need to take the time to peel through it and watch, listen and read.     The Documentary of the making of Promise is a great peek into the workings of a band and the struggles of Springsteen early in his career. The back story and the pressure of making a follow up of Born to Run had to be a large cross to bare.    It is the music of the Promise That makes this a must have: Darkness has some of His best work Candy's Room to this day is my Favorite Springsteen Song.     Do your self a Big and buy this for anyone who is a fan of Springsteen The Live DVD's show the band in all its glory.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|Tron Legacy the movie (which I very much enjoy) was said to be groundbreaking in visual effects moviemaking, and in many ways, it's one of a kind. But as far as groundbreaking, they may have been referring to mapping Jeff Bridges younger face to another actor, as the 3D effects are not as groundbreaking as they could've been.<br /><br />What is the standard for great 3D?<br /><br />Great 3D: In the time of 3D Polarized Glasses, great 3D could be described as an effect clear and strong enough to warrant wearing the glasses. Depth that is easily discerned and clearly visible, so the foreground pops apart from the mid and background imagery. This is achieved when the cameras are far enough apart when appropriate.<br /><br />Inadequate 3D:<br />Anything that is subdued to the point where you could choose to not wear the glasses and get about the same experience, is considered average 3D. Depth that is hard to discern and closer to being flat 2D than great 3D, so the foreground is almost on the same plane as the mid and background. This is achieved when the cameras are too close to each other when a better effect could've been accomplished.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as much as I was rooting for Tron Legacy's 3D considering the quality of the film itself, the 3D stereographers who filmed the movie's 3D failed to take advantage of really pushing the 3D to an unmistakable level of depth, as in Avatar 3D. Tron Legacy 3D is just average 3D. At rare moments, when Sam is being scanned before he enters the games, the 3D looks great. But the rest of the 3D in Tron Legacy unfortunately remains flat, perhaps by choice of the filmmaker.<br /><br />Film: 4/5. Great film, story, visuals, action and much improved pacing over Tron.<br />3D: 2/5. It's not as good as it could've been. Hopefully they get it right for Tron 3. The 3D ends up being \\"Do I really need to wear these glasses when the 3D is this weak? I'll just watch 2D for this one.\\" And I didn't want to say that, but I'm being totally honest here. Buy the 3D version anyway, if you liked the movie and have a 3D TV. The 3D in TL is acceptable at best. If you say it's great 3D, you need to see better 3D effects to get some perspective...<br /><br />This review is really a call for Tron 3 filmmakers to really push the 3D envelope and not play it safe next time. If you agree the 3D could be improved even slightly, click YES., if you liked the movie and have a 3D TV. The 3D in TL is acceptable at best.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|I was certainly surprised and entertained by this new version of a classic. Of course with any classic, there will always be those who get upset by changes and this version certainly has some interesting transitions from previous versions of Sherlock Holmes. Yet this physically strong and active Holmes may relate more to the original intention of the author Doyle than more cerebral versions. We see a Sherlock Holmes that is physically fit, clever, practitioner of martial arts. Just as Holmes has been changed, so to has Dr. John Watson. Jude Law plays a handsome, clever, loyal, intelligent, physically active, virile Dr. Watson. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as Sherlock Holmes and Rachel McAdams is in top form as Irene Adler, the criminal love of Holmes' life. Downey plays Holmes as brilliant and yet overextending. He plays him as clever but trouble prone. His Holmes is funny, sarcastic, and egotistical. Mark Strong is an excellent and diabolical Lord Henry Blackwood, supported in his crimes by Lord Coward, played by the handsome Hans Matheson. Lord Blackwood is a demonic power crazed murderer intent on world domination and of course Holmes is out to outsmart him. One amazing actor was Robert Maillet, a giant who plays the monstrosity Dredger, a giant human killing machine. The art direction including all exterior and interior sets, all costumes, all computer generated effects, could not have been better and was flawless in my opinion. How nice to see the newest technology used to update this classic with outstanding visual effects. I really liked this highly entertaining sexy version of Sherlock Holmes.

0312600844|5.0|Well written. Well paced. Great character development. Excellent read. And, lastly, a very important book for our time.  Ryboy
0812979656|3.0|I nearly gave up reading this book and was not surprised at the predictability of the terrible events of \\"that day\\" which the book had been building up to. It was the all to brief glimpse into the two love affairs right at the end that I felt cheated. The God of Small Things was for me a frustrating read as it weaved the background to the event through a long and drawn out detailed account, often seemingly gratuitous. The one character which stood out was Baby Kochamma, an unlikely ex-nun, who seemed particularly odious. The other characters were to my mind quite bland and the fleeting intimate relationships at the end of the book seemed to spring from very little. The setting of 1969 Southern India provided little interest and the time references such as The Sound of Music again predictable. Roy put numerous troubling events into the book: domestic violence, an abused child, divorce, the untouchables to name just a few but it all lacked any cohesion and appeared jumbled.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I love it! Definitely worth purchasing, especially for MJ's legacy.  We know all of the songs were at various stages of development, but the entire CD is worth listening to.
B00000EW65|5.0|This is the last of 3 albums Bowie did with Eno (his \\"Berlin\\" period, although this one was not recorded in Berlin. This is my favorite one of the three, and possibly my favorite Bowie album period. This one has no instrumental pieces, like on \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\". The first half of the album has a vague \\"travel\\" theme to it. In several songs Bowie mixes in bits of African drumming or arabesque sounding string synthesizer sounds. These are all rock or pop songs, but they are all \\"deconstructed\\" pop songs, because everything from the instrument sounds to the songs' construction is turned on its head, at least that's how it seemed in 1979. This album features Adrian Belew on guitar making sounds that were basically unheard of at the time. \\"DJ\\" and \\"Boys..\\" are highlights - absolutely brilliant, and Belew truly uses his guitar like a weapon on his solos. The only really weak song is \\"Red Money\\", which is the music from Iggy Pop's \\"Sister Midnight\\" set to different (inferior) lyrics. Fortunately it's at the end, so it's easy to skip that tune, but the rest is highly recommended.
030746363X|5.0|Tim's new book is packed with content that isn't just rehashed material from countless fad diets. It's over 500 pages of unique content that applies to literally any individual's physical goals. I loved it. Especially temperature manipulation. Get the book to find out how ice baths can speed up weight loss by 300% and make you sleep like a baby (not from hypothermia!).

030746363X|4.0|Other reviewers cite the fact that there's nothing new in this book, but that's the point. Tim uncovers things that people are already doing and know and put them together in new ways. That's what really smart people do. Everything he recommends is backed by some kind of data - some more robust and some not. But by bring these things to light, and giving some guidance about how to do them in everyday life, he's made them more accessible.     I gave this book 4-stars because I like it, but I'm still experimenting with the techniques. If they work, I'll gladly bump it up to 5.
0439023491|5.0|I thought this book was great! It wasn't a very difficult read and was so engrossing I could not put it down! Get the whole series! You wont be sorry!
030746363X|5.0|Yes... there is a lot of hype around this book, so curious... I started checking into some of the details and was hook.  I love it!<br /><br />I personally bought both the book and the audio book at this link:[[ASIN:0307704610 The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman]] (I know how I like to learn and process data) and I'm REALLY glad I did! I'm listening to the audio book as I commute back and forth to work. This has been great (I'm in the middle of my second listen) and it really helps with getting a good feel for the overall picture Tim Ferriss is sharing here. But if you're going to \\"take action\\" you'll need the book in print as well!<br /><br />There is a lot more to all this (if you're looking for it) than just the diet tweaks and workouts... there is a deeper story to the \\"thought processes\\" being shared. The audio book helps me with the bigger picture as I said... the book, I have been using more like a cookbook and/or reference.  It's a dense book when it comes to information and I have book marks and sticky note in a number of places already.<br /><br />The really cool part is this book allows me to dig in and pull out, understanding, and dissect the concepts that I'm more interested in doing. The bottom line as I see it is about \\"taking action\\" and seeing and testing it out for yourself.<br /><br />I've started on a couple of the tweaks Tim suggests and I'm already seeing some results. The result I like best... it's the ease in implementing these tweaks this book offers. I'm following Tim's suggestion and just tackling and tracking a couple tweaks at a time. I can tell I'm going to be referring to this book for a long time to come.
B0037QGS0A|1.0|dont be fooled by all the hype concerning this film. what could have been something eventful turns out to be overated and a rather contrived plot. amanda seyfried is rather miscast and is unconvincing . as to all the hype concerning the provanity and \\"explicit\\" sexual dialogue , this has been totaly exaggerated.(american teens use far more explicit and crude sexual dialogue in junior high school) we are exposed to heavier provanity , explicit and crude sexual dialogue  in the american pie and dozens of other teen sex comedy movies than this movie. this movie tries to be an erotic thriller but never really delivers and there for a major disappointment.
1401323952|4.0|Entertaining and classy. This book is SO Nigella. Gorgeous photos and easy to follow, real food recipes for those of us who aren't quite domestic goddess material. As always, I love it!
B002ZG981E|5.0|Being a philosophy afficionado, I drawed my very own conclusions about this gem; I just have to say that Inception is a fetish after another, brilliantly sewed and fascinating, with little trails of thought-provoking subplot and an excepcional acting performance. Christopher Nolan is our Satoshi Kon.<br /><br />\\"With relief, humilliated, terrified, he understood he also was an illusion, that somebody else was dreaming him.\\"<br />Jorge Luis Borges

0547258305|5.0|I love love love love love Kristin Cashore's books! She has an amazing writing style and is a genius story teller! My only gripe is that she seems super anti fans on her blog, it makes me feel like I am a nuisance to her by being on her page. It is also frustrating that I have been waiting FOREVER to read Bitterblue. She came out with Graceling and blew my mind and now I am hanging in the middle of limbo waiting to finish this amazing story. I hate to sound selfish, but COME ON! If writing makes her as crazy as she talks about on her blog, then why did she start in the first place. I am amazed at her talent, but am displeased by her awkward anti-social blogginess (totally made up word). I have gotten the word out to so many people to read this book, and now I feel really let down as an avid reader. I just stand frustrated and aggravated.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought this just a few days ago due to the great reviews Satechi had on all their products;  Also, when I emailed them I got a reply the same day.  This product is a very nice, very tiny little fm transmitter.  It has plenty of power to send signal over stations here in germantown, MD, about 45 minutes from DC.  The clarity is good, but if you turn up the music really loud, It gets fuzzy sounding.  This is simple to use, comes with instructions, and handles USB's very well.  Since I dont have an Ipod and use my phone as an MP3 I wanted something to play my music in my car.  But my phone has a weird connecter and doesnt use auxillary cables, so I got this which has some good functions.  This is obviously a good product and at $40 it isnt cheap but it is worth it, I ordered this monday at 6pm and got it thursday at 7pm with Postal Service Shipping!!! Great service from Satechi, Great stuff from satechi. Thank you SATECHI.  Very good product so far, good functionality too. Thank you.
030746363X|5.0|Once again Tim has redefined our views on one of the most common topics of today, fitness and our body. Great book Tim!
030746363X|5.0|I love this book, not so much for the fact that it may make me faster, stronger, or superhuman (time will tell), but for the underlying approach it takes to personal health and fitness.  It boils down to two things.  The first is the scientific method: hypothesize (or in this case research and start with an expert's hypothesis), test, repeat.  The second is that we are human (eg motivation to diet/exercise can be a challenge), so we need to find 80/20 solutions.  The methods he suggests are just easy enough (20%) that we might be able to steel ourselves to try them out and get some pretty amazing results (80%).  Looking forward to seeing what works!
B002AOWXQ8|4.0|When I came across this band on NPR's Tiny Desk Show, it blew me away. They were a group of fun loving musician hanging out, having fun, whistling and singing. The song \\"Home\\" instantly struck a cord with me and I couldn't help but watch Jade swing around and be 100% in the moment. That tied with videos of the band journeying to the dessert, riding bicycles and  fooling around speaks of youthful bliss. Great songs are: Janglin', Home, Up From Below.
B002ZG980U|1.0|I was extremely excited to see this in the theaters when it came having enjoyed The Dark Knight after reading the reviews.  But, once the credits rolled I seriously had to rethink my opinion of Christopher Nolan.  I constantly hear from friends and read reviews that the movie is for \\"thinkers\\".  Other than the confusing (but traceable, if you can call it that) plot devices of the dream space this movie offers nothing deeper than Die Hard or any other action movie.  And that's what has bothered me the most about this movie.  Nolan, critics, viewers, and the movie itself seem to insist on some sort of deep psychological meaning, but it simply wasn't there.  Dream space, although intricately structured, was still structured, offering a solution (and a stupid one) to the complexity of the human mind.  For example the adversaries of the movie were sub-conscious projections of one's dream that represented people with guns, clothes, etc.  Why is this so?  The movie makes no explanation, but even if it did it would still be a bad one.  But, if there is anything this I have enjoyed about this movie it is debating over it's merits so feel free to comment!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie has definitely been added to my Christmas movie catalog.  I LOVED it after watching in the theater, and was so happy to purchase it when it was released on dvd.  Love Actually is funny and heartwarming, and if you haven't seen it yet, please do not hesitate to watch it this year!  Bill Nighy is hilarious, and the all star cast does not disappoint :)
B003EI2EH2|2.0|I am writing this review because I was indeed very disappointed and I find it ridiculous that 100+ 5 stars review are posted on day 1. I guess you need to be a very fast reader to enjoy this *Cough*.  This book is a two stars because Tim's writing style is entertaining. If you read this book one chapter at a time and in random order that is. Chapters feel disconnected and either repeating or contradicting themselves ( dismisses calories count but refers to them continuously). It leaves you wondering if this book has been edited whatsoever. Certainly feels like a one man job.  The approach of telling &#34;everybody out there has it plain wrong, but now you are in good hands&#34; is the most common and thickest plot in the fitness industry (Read any fitness blog or watch any fitness equipment infomercial). Unfortunately, this book follows the exact same path. Research coming out of nowhere and self inflicted experiment are the best &#34;facts&#34; you will get to feed on. I hope you are a believer.  Claims such as &#34;It works because I have never seen it fail&#34; don't really cut it for me. Not that I need strong scientific backing but I wasn't in for a sermon either. The diet is based on what Tim likes, but if you try hard enough you will get use to it. Come on, dieting is enough of a pain on what you like so do you really believe people will eat pinto beans for breakfast on a regular basis? This is closer to rabbit poop than food!  Rehashing is also a major theme. I have nothing against aggregating ideas in a central place, but a vast majority of the fat loss material has already been published for free on Tim's Blog (I mean copy-pasted!). You really need to read it through to find new material, the bulk has been out there (for free) for over a year.  On the bright side, this is yet another lesson in self promotion and internet networking. Not sure I want to be sponsoring this anymore though.  If Tim is your personal Jesus then you might get motivation out of this reading otherwise you are left with a 2 stars bargain bin material.  EDIT: 7 years after this original review, I realized two things: - There is a complete disconnection between the book content and it's 5 star ratings (No, I didn't read them all) - All Tim Ferris books have *the exact same* ratings pattern. Check it out, really disturbing considering that some are actually good. If I was an author, I would root for the 4-hour Amazing Amazon Ratings. This has snake oil marketing written all over it.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  Very entertaining with lots of action and humor.    I viewed it using direct streaming.  This was my first experience with direct streaming of a rented movie, and I have to say I was impressed.  The quality was better than I expected!    I do wish that the rental came with DVD-style bonus features like deleted scenes or \\"making of\\" featurettes.  This is just the movie.
B003AO1SVS|1.0|Oh boy, where to begin?<br /><br />Did somebody get lonely making something akin to music and not getting any pats on the back from the spray-on-hair whizzes planted behind the superdesks? Perhaps a codependent stray met his puppy-love match and la-la land ensued, what with the brains being ejaculated all over the place in a fury of white-hot resignation.<br /><br />I almost decided to give this abortion of blues-infused smut five stars, nearly convincing myself that it couldn't seem this bad if it weren't purposely tongue-in-cheek, but then I remembered that Grandma used to fart directly on her hubby's face for no other reason than that it asserted who was the boss of their relationship. Baboons flinging poo in a territorial tizzy tend to get their own space.<br /><br />Which means the fates get the last laugh again. It merely puts The Black Keys back at square one: When you're still -- or back -- in your basement studio, unadultured by sex for hire, money for nothing, there are no limits, the world is in your palm.<br /><br />But who cares about that anymore? I need to get rich quick and I need my Twitter army pronto. I need to make toast flecked with golden nuggets of awesomeness. Can I buy that in a bottle? Of course, junior. Just hire the right coach. Or fire the wrong coach. Just sit back. Are you pretty? Good, we'll squeeze a few years out of you before we send you to the slaughterhouse.
1423134206|5.0|This book is gorgeous! I recently received it as a gift. It is chock full (cover to cover) with concept art from almost all of disney's animated films (including their most recent effort, Tangled). I love seeing the different art styles of the various artists, how character concepts changed over time and some of the beautiful environmental paintings. Definitely worth buying!
B000M343BM|5.0|Great movie like everyone says but I want to make a correction to Amazon's review which says the woman owner wants team to lose so she \\"can sell\\" the team. No. So she can move the team. It was the only way she could break the lease. Proof is in the movie itself when coach tells the \\"loser\\" players they'll all be fired and new players brought in by her. Why would you want to make your team losers and then try to sell them? Duh.    BTW, just one point: when I was in about 4th/5th grade, years and years ago, and living in the Shaker Heights area of Cleveland, my older cousin would get free tickets to the Indians games from school for her straight A's. She took me to the games, so I was lucky enough to see some of the biggest names in baseball history play in the old stadium, including Ted Williams.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|This was a very good book it was a little strange reading it from the point of view of a five year old.  The author did a very good job.
B000MV90IU|5.0|\\"Bulitt\\" is undoubtedly a landmark film including three slick and impressionable ingredients of the late 60s: star power with presence, a widely imitated car chase in the hilly streets of San Francisco, and a highly stylistic approach to cinematography and music.  Whether you like the movie is one thing but the aforementioned ingredients successfully make you remember it.  I happen to like it.  The late Steve McQueen provides the star power, the presence (largely lacking in current-day actors), and injects a sizable dose of naturalness in the interpretation of his character to the stiff and contrived style common in the 60s to lend a gritty and edgy feel to the movie.  It works for the movie.  The now infamous car chase has been imitated in one of the last \\"Dirty Harry\\" movies and in 1995's \\"Jade\\" as well as other movies.  Although the later car chases have managed to one-up the original in terms of action and camera work (due to more stable equipment), the later movies do not hold the same appeal.  And as anyone can tell you, imitation is pale.  While watching the opening sequence of \\"Bulitt\\", you'll also notice a strange similarity between this movie and \\"Oceans Eleven\\" in terms of musical style and even title transitions and movement.  But like I said, imitation is pale.  The screenplay for \\"Bulitt\\" serves its intended purpose but it is really propelled by the good direction, acting, and Lalo Schifrin's memorable musical score.  Watch this movie and you won't regret it.  If you have a habit of watching movies multiple times, this one may grow on you.  A great classic!

B003EYVXUU|5.0|This movie is a brilliant cultural repositioning of a tremendously original movie that deserved the acclaim it received.  To compare them is both complimentary and an injustice simultaneously.  Credit must ultimately be given to the original story by the novel's author.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|As a long time Doctor Who fan, I admit to being apprehensive when Matt Smith was announced as the eleventh Doctor. It took exactly 5 minutes into 'The Eleventh Hour' and I was completely captivated by that face appearing over the TARDIS, followed by \\"Can I have an apple?\\". In other words, I was hooked.  The story certainly goes on in the more than capable hands of current showrunner Steven Moffat, and the newest Doctor, Matt Smith.    Moffat has written a witty and at times, poignant, modern fairy tale of a young girl who meets a mad man in a box, and the adventures they have when she grows up. The stories are uniformly entertaining, although the Moffat ones stand out, as does 'Vincent and the Doctor', 'The Lodger' and 'Vampires of Venice'. It's no secret that Moffat is a Doctor Who geek, like many of us, and it shows most delightfully in the way he pays homage to traditions in the Whoniverse, while introducing his own new contributions like the Weeping Angels from the previous series or the character of River Song. If this series is any indication, Moffat has left his stamp on the series in ways that will continue to make it grow even more interesting as he develops his continuing story lines.    And the acting ... Matt Smith is a revelation. He is uniquely able to look and behave around 12 and then, a few scenes later, ancient and wise. His Doctor is slightly unhinged, but marked by a deep compassion for humanity, particularly Amy Pond. I fell in love with young Amelia Pond, thanks to the wonderfully natural acting by Caitlin Blackwood, who is a delight in her scenes with the Doctor. Karen Gillan makes grown up Amy a wonderful counter to the Doctor - acerbic, slightly mad herself, and very much taken with her Raggedy Doctor. And finally, Arthur Darvill made the character of Rory Williams come to life in such a realistic fashion that it's impossible not to like him from the moment he makes his entrance.
B0044KI7B6|5.0|This is the best TV show ever! This season 6 has great writing and acting.  Each episode plot is interesting and creative as is the overarching plot; it is really well assembled.  Jensen Ackles, as \\"Dean\\", is funny and sweet.  Jared is convincing as a soulless monster killer.  This show holds my interest, and wow, it's TV!
B0034G4OVS|4.0|In this world of digital cut & paste MTV style editing, people often have trouble sitting through a portion of movie that isn't changing scenes every 2 seconds, or doesn't cut to the chase scenes fast enough.  For those who can stand to let a character or two develop, this is a pretty cool movie (although hard to sit through for different reasons).  I had trouble with the characters in the beginning (not the best acting starting out), but man, they bring it on in time.  The movie is not a horror movie but some scenes are pretty hard to watch, and not wanting to spoil any part of the movie, the one that would be the hardest is done Hitchcock Psycho Shower style.  But the images my mind conjured - whew!  Anyway, I'm glad I watched the film and if you are a film buff, I believe you will enjoy it too.  Remember, no one is going to win any Oscars with this film, but you will be left moved (momentarily scarred) none the less.  Peace Out!
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|Are you Kidding? This is it? The long-awaited series on the Pacific War that was supposed to be a bookend to \\"A Band of Brothers\\"? It looks as though Mr. Murphy was right after all: \\"If anything can go wrong, it will.\\" For just about everything that could went wrong with this series.    First of all \\"The Pacific\\" isn't a true historical series. More like a soap opera production with some interesting, and gratuitously gory, battle scenes thrown in. (You'd think every Marine was issued with a pair of pliers to extract the gold dental work of dead Japanese soldiers.) There's a definite anti-war spin to the series, and the suggestion that American soldiers were as brutal as those of the Japanese Imperial Army. There was, for example, a scene in which a Marine is using a dead Japanese soldier as a pin cushion with his bayonet, as if this was the moral equivalent to the Nanking atrocities.     (The Nanking massacre was was not an isolated incident. One statistic tells us all we need to know about Japanese savagery and the \\"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\\": approximately 30 million Chinese (and Asian) civilians died as a result of Japan's 15-year campaign of rapine, pillage and murder in Manchuria and on the Chinese mainland.)    Unlike \\"A Band of Brothers,\\" the producers decided to make this series a statement about the personal lives of three soldiers, derived from their letters and diaries (like there's not enough third-rate melodrama already available on TV?). So, Guadalcanal is viewed from the perspective the \\"Battle of Henderson Field\\" and Chesty Puller rather than the \\"Battle of Edson's Ridge,\\" a patch of real estate defended by Colonel Edson and his Raider Battalion, considered by both American and Japanese strategists to have been the most decisive battle of the Guadalcanal campaign and possibly of the entire Pacific War.     Battles in which Marine battalions defeated regimental strength Japanese forces were typical of the Guadalcanal campaign, revealed inthe final casualty toll of 5 to 1. This lopsided tally was due to superior fire power and tactics: Japanese mass banzai attacks, frontal assaults and infiltration with rifle companies, which were effective against the Chinese army, amounted to pure suicide against seasoned Marines with automatic weapons. But the true enemies of the Japanese Imperial Army were the malarial jungles of the Solomons and the deadly accuracy of the Dauntless SBD dive bombers that sank nine Japanese troop ships.    The inevitable comparison with BoB is not favorable to \\"The Pacific.\\" BoB was a reasonably accurate dramatization of historical events. In contrast, \\"The Pacific\\" is dominated by a subtext: a surfeit of gore, an atmosphere of moral ambiguity and moral equivalence (e.g. repeated scenes of American brutality and the noble dedication of the Japanese soldier), a breathtaking indifference to historical fact and the strategic picture. There are, for example, the obligatory scenes displaying photos a dead Japanese soldier's family. (Yes, we know these obedient Japanese sons came from good families -- just like the Americans! -- the very families that raised them to murder hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Asian civilians in the name of their emperor, a war criminal with a hunger for conquest.) Indeed, the critics of this shoddy, lurid and sensationalized production, who say it is a insult to the military, are not far off the mark.     In short, \\"The Pacific\\" is another unsavory exhibit of America's unquenchable appetite for 'slob culture,' and viewers taken in by the sexual sleaze, gore, pseudo-realism, and melodrama of this amateur production need to take stock. That said, the battle scenes are riveting (if not entirely factual). Battlefield vérité, in which you can actually hear the sound of shrapnel hitting a soldier's canteen, is Spielberg's strength; coherent narrative and convincing dialog are not. The problem here is historical authenticity and a fundamental lack of seriousness. Victory in the Pacific was an amazing story of U.S. persistence, bravery and the military genius of men like Colonel Merritt Edson, General Alexander Vandegrift and Admiral Ernest King. Dumbing down the action to the personal level does a disservice not only to the men who fought these battles, but to the intelligence of American viewers. Alas! Who said Hollywood was dead?
B003EYVXXW|5.0|All my life I have seen numerous movies that show the 'evil' pagans torturing the saintly Christian martyrs.  Agora is important because, to my knowledge, this is the first time in a major film that there has been an attempt to show that the older pagan tradition was not evil, but possibly noble.  I know the story of Hypatia.  While there are minor inaccuracies, the film is honest and tells the true story.  About her personal life, the film is imaginative, obviously.  It is a movie after all.      One detail that has been promulgated about Hypatia is certainly not true; she was not an atheist.  Hypatia was a mathematician and a Neoplatonist philosopher.  The Neoplatonists most certainly believed in and understood Divinity, and at a very sophisticated level.  When such wisdom is properly perceived, it is conceivable that it could be accepted by a scientific atheist....conceivable, but a bit of a stretch.  And it should also be known that pagans of antiquity thought of Christians as atheists, i.e., they did not believe in the Gods.
0312600844|4.0|I love to read . I love to read historical fiction  and I have the Corrections on my book shelves.  So it was a  no-brainer for me to read Franzen's new book and I firmly believe that it is the duty of an artist to portray the time he is living in and I thought that Franzen was doing this with the Corrections.  Like with the Corrections,  I was not immediately  into the book. Only after a few hundred pages I was hooked to a point that I read the whole night to finish the book.  I guess, I belong in the group, who liked the book though I have to admit that I never reread Correction, which is unusual for me, as I tend to read books I like several times.     So we will see how this one will weather. I did not grow up in the US but live here since over 30 years. I feel a little bit like the neighbor watching the Berglunds. Close, but not intimate, looking in from outside.    I miss the experience of going to school and college in the States, though I studied a few semester at different universities here. I mention this because I cannot relate at all to the importance of  team sports in this culture. So Patty's  school years experiences are a mystery to me.  The rest I could fully relate to and found an accurate depiction of  our society.. The family problems, the environmental issues, the sexual  desires and tensions, the different personification of depression,  the portrayal of life in the US in the last decades, the political background. I wonder sometimes if depression is a sign of our time, or we just declare every bad mood a depression.     I am lucky enough to have traveled all over the States with emphasis on the National Parks and  the most prominent cities, but I only lived in the Southwest and of course my experience are limited to life there. I love the natural beauty of this country and during my travels I was deeply disturbed to see how much damage was inflicted unnecessarely on this beautiful land. As I grew up in Europe I already came as a \\"tree-hugger\\"to this country and had my problems with too many too big cars per family, excessive consumption of  natural resources,  sprawling trashy developments  and a wide-spread unawareness of the impact of  overpopulation on our planet. I felt very close to Walter  and actually sad that I never met anybody like him.   The necessity to compromise became clear to me versus the end of the book when he tries to convince a neighbor to restrain their bird-murdering cat . I hate to restrict the freedom of cats, on the other hand I equally  hate when they kill birds for fun.    And I also believe that we can love somebody who is flawed, but it has to be mutual, so Walter stayed my hero to the very end. I am certainly going to read Franzen's next book.
038572179X|5.0|This is a gripping tale. I loved it.  It kept itself at the forefront of my mind for weeks after I read it.  Not many books can do that. This year when anyone asks me for a book recommendation, this is it.
B000005JA8|5.0|I found out just now that Don Van Vliet, better known as Captain Beefheart, passed away yesterday at the age of 69. When this album first came out all those years ago and I went to buy it, my local record store did not have a copy of Trout Mask Replica on the shelf. I had to special-order it which involved paying for it up front and then waiting nearly a month for it to come in, something I didn't really mind because although I had not yet heard one note or line from the album, a friend of mine had assured me it was the best album in the entire world. I plunked my dough on the counter and the wait for my Captain Beefheart album began. Three weeks later, I stopped at the record store on my way home and sure enough, waiting for me there was my brand-new copy of Trout Mask Replica. Cool! Coincidentally, earlier that very same day, I had also picked up a kilo of some pretty decent weed. I went home, twisted up a coupla' doobs, lit up and put the Captain on the record player. I swear, the higher I got, the better that album sounded until, after WAY too much smoking, I too was convinced, just as my friend Bob was, that Trout Mask Replica was indeed the best g*****n album in the entire history of the whole human race! I played it over and over all freakin' night! The next day, perfectly sober, while I packaged up my product for distribution, I began playing Trout Mask Replica again. WTF?! I waited three weeks for THIS?!  It seemed to be more of an incoherent, totally unintelligible mess than the brilliant masterwork it appeared to be while I was heavily under the influence the day and night before. I hate to admit it but without the help of a heavy load of THC onboard, it actually seemed like a complete waste of money and a total piece of crap. I called my buddy and told him I'd picked up the Beefheart Album. When he immediately asked me how I liked it, I said I absolutely LOVED it when I was buzzed but not so much at all when I was straight. Not so much at all! Totally incredulous, he shouted, YOU LISTENED TO IT STRAIGHT?! Why the hell did you do THAT?! Point taken, I thought. Not to worry. I still had plenty of 'product' left! I played, replayed and enjoyed that album under the influence often enough that it eventually grew on me until the point where I enjoyed it just as much while sober! It's been decades since I've smoked the devil's lettuce and probably just as long since I listened to the Captain. I'm probably not gonna start smoking weed again but when I get back home later today, I'm gonna go downstairs, dig out my dusty old turntable and I'm gonna bring it upstairs and hook it up to my surround sound system. Then I'm gonna search through the boxes under the stairs, dig out my old copy of Trout Mask Replica, the same one from all those years ago in fact, and I'm gonna play it all the way through while raising a glass or three to a true American original, a true American genius. Godspeed, Good Captain. Farewell.credulous, he shouted, YOU LISTENED TO IT STRAIGHT?! Why the hell did you do THAT?! Point taken, I thought. Not to worry. I still had plenty of 'product' left!

B0042114X0|5.0|First heard them on Alt Nation. Mark my words this band is gonna blow up in the U.S. I can already feel it.  Reminds me of passion pit/temper track.  Some very good tracks like Young Blood, All of This, and Punching in a Dream.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I'm a long-time Accept fan and I LOVE this album. It is even heavier than the albums from the 80s. The production and mix are fantastic. It sounds great! It's definitely Accept. Plenty of scorching guitar solos and plenty of melodic runs, too. Wolf Hoffmann and Peter Baltes are here, and the new singer has very impressive pipes. It's not easy to fill Udo's shoes, but long-time Accept fans will welcome the new guy when they hear this. I think it's Accept's best album since \\"Metal Heart.\\" All Accept fans MUST own this one!

LOL hahahaha.<br />  anyway... i was just thinking.  i think this movie would be better if they made the sex-thing with the guy at the end go totally x rated and just go on totally out of proportion to the rest of the movie and just show him banging julia roberts up down every which way in every position imaginable for an hour.<br />  lol. hahahaha.  ok because i haven't seen it yet, but i gather this from what i've read so far.<br />  i absolutely MUST see it now.  it's okay if it's bad.  sometimes horrible movies have an appeal of their own to me.<br />  i think it sounds kinda hawt.  but.  they should have made her go all over in the different countries just getting the heck b*nged out of her by all these random foreign guys.<br />  that would have been worth the price of admission.  LOL hahahahha. sorry<br />  Promise i will get back to you after i see this ! ~ :)=<br />  btw i am NOT a julia roberts fan but this sounds irresistably, as many reviews said, self-indulgent audacious.  lol haha
0525951652|3.0|Thankfully, I have a Kindle for this 1,000-pager. In fact, largely because of the Kindle, I've read Pillars of the Earth, its sequel, and Fall of Giants just since acquiring a Kindle (I'm about 80 percent through Fall of Giants). As with his thrillers, which I read years ago, there's a lot to like about Follett's latest. All his novels are page turners.     What I like about Fall of Giants is that I get a better feel for the places and the era than I did in his two medieval novels. I did learn some things about the start of WWI that I didn't know and got a refresher on what I had learned years ago about the war and the Soviet revolution. What doesn't sit well with me is that in his latest Follett fails to weave the protagonists stories gracefully into historical events; historical events seem to be the main focus rather than his characters, who appear at times to function mainly as teaching tools. The medieval novels, for me, fell far behind those of other writers about that era (Diana Norman aka Ariana Franklin and Ellis Peters, aka Edith Parteger, as just two examples) in that they lacked period detail and successful integrating of characters into history. At least in Fall of Giants, I am satisfying my taste for history.    All that said, as always with Follett, I'm rolling right along enjoying finding out what happens with all his characters. He's a terrific storyteller, and I'll probably read the other two in the trilogy when they're published.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|Upon seeing the previews for this i really wasn't to thrilled, although i'm a big Denzil fan and also Tony Scott who lately has been casting Denzil in about all his films. My favorite of his is definitely \\"Man On Fire\\" great story, great emotion, and something to watch again and again. Well how does Unstoppable fair amongst Scotts best, well most are saying it's his best in years, i would have to disagree. While the story is kind of fresh with the whole runaway train deal, the plot(story) is thin and has really been done a lot before. New guy on the job(Chris Pine), gets to partner up with Veteran (Denzil Washington) for his first day of training. They exchange some small talk here and there, Denzil bosses him around a bit, Pine gets fed up tells him off by and by. Well once the Train is on its way the chaos starts, its not that it isn't \\"somewhat\\" tense it just seems like the train is doing all the work and making the excitement while the actors just kind of stand oddly by and watch, which what else can you do?    So does this make for a big blockbuster smash that critics and fans have made it out to be, well no not really. It's a mediocre thrill ride with some good moments, and some moments of predictability. We know the company wants to derail the train but complains it will cost millions for the train company and have some potential deadly environmental effects, so we're pretty sure that won't happen. Its pretty obvious that our boys will figure out someway of stopping the train traveling at an alarming 70mph, which i didnt even know they had that capability. So whats done is done, and it gets done, i won't say how for those who haven't seen it, but in seeing the previews who do you think are the hero's at the end of the day. Pretty easy to guess. There are some good effects and the train is intimidating to watch as it has close calls with kids on a passing train, towns, plows into cars and does cause some other means of chaos. I was actually wanting more deathand destruction, but hey its PG-13 and pretty plausible. So it falls somewhere in between good and ok, there is never a dull moment in the short 1:38 minutes of the film, i will give it that. But all the hype doesnt make this what people have made it out to be, its a good ride but far from unstoppable.
0198321511|5.0|Many consider \\"The Tempest\\" to be the final play that Shakespeare wrote solo, which gives a certain bittersweet flavor to its story -- especially since the main character is a sorcerer who manipulates others to get the ending he desires. Shakespeare juggled a trio of main stories before tying them off in rare style, but it's Prospero and his final speech that are truly intriguing.<br /><br />For many years, the exiled Duke of Milan Prospero has lived on a remote island with his young daughter Miranda. But when he discovers that his treacherous brother Antonio and his similarly treacherous friends are nearby on a sailing ship, he summons a storm that causes the ship to crash on the island.<br /><br />And like a puppet-master, Prospero arranges this as he wants -- he sends his servant Ariel to haunt the men who betrayed him, he thwarts the machinations of his evil servant Caliban, and he pretends to treat Alonso's son Ferdinand badly while secretly matchmaking him with Miranda. In the end, everything will be as he desired.<br /><br />\\"The Tempest\\" is a play with two different dimensions. On one hand, we have a simple story about a mage whose power allows him to manipulate everything in his little domain. And on the other, we have the story of a brilliant storyteller who arranges his own little worlds as he sees fit, and bids farewell to his role (\\"Now my charms are all o'erthrown/And what strength I have's mine own...\\")<br /><br />And appreciated on its own, \\"The Tempest\\" is a brilliant play -- Shakespeare juggled the three main plotlines nicely, and brought a solid sense of resolution to the story. His rich dialogue is stunning (\\"But doth suffer a sea-change/Into something rich and strange/Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell...\\"), especially during Ariel's songs and Prospero's speeches. Even the insults are brilliant -- just try yelling \\"A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!\\" at someone you don't like.<br /><br />Prospero is a rather unique character -- he rules over his little island with magical powers, sort of like a local demigod. Everything that happens on the island is because he wants it to be so, but he's a sad, benevolent figure rather than a tyrannical one. And Shakespeare sketches up an intriguing cast of characters, both mortal and immortal -- the ethereal, puckish Ariel and grotesque Caliban, the naive Miranda, and the contemptible trio of onetime conspirators.<br /><br />\\"O brave new world, That has such people in't!\\" cries Miranda at the end of \\"The Tempest,\\" and while not every character in it deserves a \\"brave new world,\\" the play itself feels like a weekend trip into a magical world.e island with magical powers, sort of like a local demigod.

B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Nicki Minaj came on like a storm- she came from nowhere to becoming a guest on a track by everyone from Mariah Carey to X-Tina to Kanye West.  The music hype machine was in overdrive, describing her with ridiculous superlatives.    The crazy thing?  They weren't exaggerating.  This is the best female rap album to date.  She obviously has intensely creative rap skills, but she also has the ability to craft pop songs.  Her hooks are insanely addictive- she sears lines into your brain causing musical hallucination for days.     There are a couple of throwaway tracks here, but when she's at the top of her game like on \\"I'm the Best\\" \\"Roman\\" and \\"Blazin'\\" she is absolutely unstoppable.     This album may not please hard-core rap fans, but it will be accessible to a large number of music fans.  This is great music! Other than Kanye's \\"Dark Fantasy\\" this is the best R&B/Hip-hop album of the year.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|This movie will take you in so many directions your head will spin. You will definitely find yourself sympathizing a lot.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are so difficult to watch because the thought is so horrific. I was literally in awe of some of the things that happened in the film. It dragged on at times but always kept you interested to want to find out WHY and WHAT will happen.<br /><br />The main reason it didnt get a 5 is because i watched this AFTER Frontier(s)..awesome movie and the ending was so ridiculous i actually sat there in disbelief throughout the whole credit roll.I can't believe they failed the ending so badly.<br /><br />Not for the fainthearted or the ones that cry easily. Some scenes are still burned in my memory.
1401228801|4.0|I hold no comic of the last 10 years in higher esteem than Fables.  The irreverent, creative, mind-bending tales are full of literary and pop culture allusions.  The writing is crisp, the dialogue near-perfection and the art is painstakingly beautiful.     This TBP covers issues 86-93.  Besides a couple of small quick stories, the bulk of this volume is the \\"Witches.\\"  It is actually amazing how Willingham has been able to continue to weave the \\"Fables\\" tales this long.  After Fabletown in NYC was destroyed, it felt like the story was over with.  It may be just me, but it feels like the series is getting a bit long in the tooth.  I hope Willingham is able to use this set of issues to transition into another new, interesting direction for \\"Fables\\" but this volume does not have me 100% convinced.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|This I thought was a wonderful movie - intelligent, a love story, action, you name it! Like all really great SF, it concentrates on the people, not the tech. I rented it, then bought it to keep.
B003VIW8DK|5.0|In a sentence, this is an up to date, sexier \\"Avalon.\\"    Roxy Music (and Bryan Ferry) is such an interesting band, one of the few to have dual personalities throughout their history and be great at both.  If you are an early Roxy music fan, a glam-rock purist, be aware that this is no \\"Country Life.\\"  As a Bryan Ferry post-Avalon solo effort, it's clearly along the lines of Avalon.      For fans of \\"Avalon Roxy Music\\" this album will not disappoint in the least.  It is Bryan Ferry at his best- tight, multi-layered musical production with amazing attention to detail.  The sophisticated, upscale, sexy mood dominates, with just a touch of Euro-dance beat.  Not a single wasted track - every one is eminently listenable. Excellent!      If you're looking for the original Roxy Music, you will just have to pull out your old LPs. If you want Bryan Ferry at his post-Avalon best, this album will thrill you.

B00006IUL2|3.0|I first viewed MEDEA back in the 70's in an \\"art house\\" theatre. The audience was mainly composed of Callas fans--and if you're a Callas fan you're usually a fanatical Callas fan. Personally I was more interested in the original MEDEA by Euripides (absolutely butchered in the film) & had very little exposure to Maria Callas at the time. After watching her (non-musical) version of MEDEA, I joined the fanatics.<br /><br />Certainly this film will not be everyone's cup of tea. It opens with Medea blessing the fields for a good harvest. A near naked, muscular beautiful young man is bound between 2 poles. He is in a high level of intoxication. Then a third pole is used to slowly break his neck. The body is chopped up and excited farmers of all ages & sexes rush to get body parts to plant in the fields for fertility. If you make it through this scene you'll probably stay to witness the rest--not that it's the only act of brutality in store.<br /><br />To write that Callas is stunning in the role is an understatement. The only person who came close to this level of performance was Greek actress Melina Mercouri who performed the traditional version of MEDEA in the famous Amphitheatre in Athens. Both women bestowed a natural regal beauty & personal power to this most difficult role of a sorceress & princess who is betrayed & kills her own children as the ultimate act of revenge.<br /><br />Director Passolini (who was eventually murdered in \\"real\\" life) sets his MEDEA in a strangely beautiful & mesmerizing world. Medea considers herself to be a descendant of the Sun God, and he speaks directly to her. Medea isn't insane, but she is obsessed with Jason, the man she has betrayed her country for. Jason's goal is to steal the fabled Golden Fleece & Medea helps him do it. She has enlisted her brother's aid in accomplishing the theft, and the trio flees in a chariot in order to reach Jason's waiting ship. Medea's father discovers the sacrilege (The Fleece was a sacred relic) & sets off in his chariot in order to overtake the thieves. To prevent her father from reaching them, Medea hacks her beloved brother  to pieces & tosses out his body one limb after another as an effective strategy to sidetrack the father & promote her escape with Jason.<br /><br />No light entertainment here.<br /><br />It's obvious that Passolini's MEDEA was a paen to Callas' commanding beauty. Unfortunately that gem is set in a very flawed ring. The other actors are more or less just props, they certainly can't act. They appear to be cataonic, unexciting.  Jason, whose masculine charms drove Medea mad, is scrawny & not particular handsome. To say he can't act is being kind. Maybe the idea was not to have anyone more beautiful than Callas?<br /><br />Inexplicably, the major scene in which Medea sends garments to her rival is repeated twice. The first version is more or less how Euripedes wrote it: the princess puts on the clothes & bursts into flame; her father tries to put the fire out, but he too is seared with his daughters body. So far so good, but then Passolini repeats the exact scene. but without fire. All I could fathom from this was that the first scene was in Medea's mind, and the second...who knows? It really doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />Finally--and most unforgivable--Passolini has a mishmash of musical genres performed by various actors. In one scene a Greek is singing a Japanese song (no kidding!), and in another a chorus of Greek women is singing an Albanian folk song circa the 20th century. There are 1 or 2 other instances of this musical mayhem. Again. it makes no sense.<br /><br />MEDEA--may be only fully appreciated by theatre buffs, Greek literature & history enthusiasts and, of course, Callas fanatics. It is worth VIEWING once just to see The extraordinary beauty of Maria Callas.<br /><br />PS. You can see snippets of Melina Mercouri's Medea in A DREAM OF PASSION with Ellen Burtsyn (who plays a modern day Medea).<br /><br />[[ASIN:6300133591 Dream of Passion [VHS]]]<br />[[ASIN:B000PMFS6E Iphigenia (MGM World Films)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005N913 The Odyssey]]<br />[[ASIN:B00000IOUX Black Orpheus: The (The Criterion Collection)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005UJY8 Electra]]Odyssey]]  [[ASIN:B00000IOUX Black Orpheus: The (The Criterion Collection)]]  [[ASIN:B00005UJY8 Electra]]
0316098337|5.0|Emma Donoghue has given us a unique reading experience in her latest novel Room. We experience life through the eyes of an intelligent, precocious and lovable Jack whose entire world is an 11x 11 room where he and his ma are kept captive.Though life is a horror,Jack's mom shields him from the harsh realities and nurtures his growth and intelligence through her own creativity and the meager possessions in Room. She never falters in giving him the maximum mental stimulation and physical exercise despite the confines and shortages of food and supplies.She and Jack are almost one in this close and unnatural set of circumstances. Breast feeding becomes  a survival mechanism for both as they desperately need this closeness to cope.One of the few possessions that Old Nick, the kidnapper, provides is a TV which becomes a window to the outside world. This world is not real to Jack until circumstances change when ma decides to put an escape plan into effect.   The novel gives such an eye opening insight into the mind of a child. I think parents everywhere will look at their young ones differently after reading Room. Although it has  a dark theme, Room is quite uplifting as it is at its core  a homage to maternal love and the resilience of the human spirit. Jack's voice will echo long in the minds of readers who gain from him such insight into a child's view of the world. The book is so vivid it is hard not to see a movie form as one is reading. Who can portray Jack?? That will be a Hollywood challenge for sure. I loved Room and hope book clubs will choose this gem!

Just read this one by Tim Ferriss and you'll have all you need:  facts, a plan, inspiration and humor.  Tons of humor.  Tim's wiritng has always been great but this book exceeds my expectations.  I just bought ten copies to give to friends and families for this holiday season.  Follow some of Tim's plans here and you will (literally) chnage your life, and the lives of many around you.  Just don't read it in bed while your significant other is trying to sleep next to you.  Your underlining, page turning and laughter will annoy them to no end.  I thought my wife Aileen was going to throw me out of bed last night when I burst out laughing at the first line of Tim's section on \\"Ultra-Endurance\\" that begins with these words:  \\"Testicles and steel are like oil and vinegar:  they don't usually mix well.\\"  Good stuff.

0201633612|3.0|I think I've found the cure for insomnia!<br /><br />I majored in Engineering Math and Computer Science in college; so I'm not having any trouble comprehending the material -- I'm having trouble staying awake while reading it!  I've been working professionally as a programmer since 1995, and one of the things I dread in trying to keep up with ever-changing programming tools, techniques, and languages is having to wade through academic treatises such as this one.<br /><br />Now, I'm only 22 pages into a nearly 400 page book, but the writing style is definitely more geared toward academics and theoreticians than practicing software developers.  Case in point is the following excerpt from page 22:<br /><br />\\"An object-oriented program's run-time structure often bears little resemblance to its code structure.  The code structure is frozen at compile-time; it consists of classes in fixed inheritance relationships.  A program's run-time structure consists of rapidly changing networks of communicating objects.  In fact, the two structures are largely independent.  Trying to understand one from the other is like trying to understand the dynamism of living ecosystems from the static taxonomy of plants and animals, and vice versa.\\"<br /><br />\\"...the dynamism...from the static taxonomy...\\"???  Really?  They couldn't come up with a better analogy?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm still hopeful that the content of the book will be worth the effort required to trudge my way through the authors' exceedingly dull delivery...but until I get to the meat of the material (which won't happen until around page 81), the struggle will be to say awake long enough to clear more than a couple of pages at a time.<br /><br />-----<br />OK, it's taken me 6 weeks, but I finally finished the book.  My opinion of the book has improved somewhat.  The content of the book is actually very good.  Much of it simply puts a name to things that I do in my software development on a regular basis; but, some of the patterns presented have introduced me to some ideas or designs that I hadn't previously been exposed to.  I still find the authors' writing style to be dry and off-putting -- it reads like it was written for a master's or doctoral candidate's thesis, and not like it was targeted at a \\"practicing\\" programmer.  Several of the code examples provided are for SmallTalk -- and in the 19 years I've been working as a programmer, I have yet to see a company advertise for SmallTalk programmers...I'm not saying there isn't one, I'm just saying that I haven't seen it.  Unfortunately, the authors seem to go out of their way to avoid references to \\"Windows\\" (the dominant OS, even in 1995 when the book was written / published); instead constantly making references to Unix and a variety of tools that were relatively common on that platform.<br /><br />I guess my beef is that this book's target audience seems to be a relatively small demographic, while the material itself is of great value to a much larger audience.  Instead of targeting the community of programmers as a whole, it seems to focus more on the academic community, and is written in such a way as to appeal to that group.  I'd much rather have seen examples and a writing style with broader appeal.<br /><br />If I were to give separate ratings to content and writing style, I'd rate the content at 4-stars (maybe 4.5), but the writing style is only 2-stars.  Overall, I'm increasing my original 2-star rating to 3-stars.<br /><br />I'm getting started on reading \\"Head First Design Patterns\\" -- a different presentation of very similar material.  While it may be re-hashing the same material I just read, I'm hoping I'll get more out of a different presentation.

1591843162|1.0|The rhetoric of persuasion fills these pages.  What a gift from God himself this book is!  A Divine diatribe, an emotional appeal, a call to action without reflection, a shout to share whatever stuff you conceive, a harangue to harness your inner child and finish what you've started. Ah, what a fun roller coaster ride this book is, full of the pastor's call to 'Hear God's Command To Create', the televangelist's appeal to 'listen for the still soft voice of Divine Creativity within you, and bring it forth!!, o ye of little faith!\\"   O, You Too can create, just stop criticizing yourself. Leap before you look, child. Trust the Eternal Market, it's begging you to Bring Forth your Art! It will gladly consume what YOU have to offer, because it rejects what 'they' have  to offer. You can see how intelligent The Market is, because it discards the creators so easily. And do you know why it discards those who create? Because The Market is waiting for something Authentic, something Brilliant, something only YOU can create.  So, what are YOU waiting for? They're just waiting to give you their money? Why won't you take it? Are you man enough to take it?    I'm lucky to be surrounded by many people in my life who read this book, and took immediate action!  Here's some examples:  1) My brother-in-law was inspired to quit his job, and begin that business he's always dreamed of.  He's in the beginning stages of building a nationwide retailer of 'artistic goods'.  His stores will sell everything unique, everything different, everything you truly want, but can't find at those 'other' retailers.    2) My sister decided that a life filled with bosses, offices, timeclocks, and deadlines was the DeadEnd. She's devoting herself to opening an Educational System for Creative Artists. Whatever a person wants to study, she'll find a way to help them learn.    3) My neighbor is deeply inspired by Dana Torres, the 41 yr old Olympic Swimmer. He's decided to become a professional boxer.  He's notlistening to any of those 'lizard brain' emotions that tell him he's too old at 49. No way! He's waking up early, doing pushups in the basement, jump-ropes, and a 3 mile jog each morning. In 4 months, he's schedule for his 1st bout at the local gym.   4) My niece dropped out of medical school. She realized that her 'old passion' of being a surgeon was just a passing fad. Now, she's going to be a Celebrity Actress, just like Anne Hathaway!   She's moved to LA, and actually went on a casting call for a part in a movie!  5) Me, i'm quitting my job, and i'm going to be a Motivational Book Writer. I figure, i read a lot of books anyway, and i'm really motivated, and i'm good enough, i'm smart enough, and i want to do it.  My wife isn't too happy, because we use my salary to pay the mortgage. But she's a 'Lizard Brain', a 'Negative Nancy', a 'Status Quo Suzie'.  If she won't accept me for who i am, a Successful Motivational Writer, well, then, i'll just sign those divorce papers. And i know she's jealous when she asks me to stop printing out one-page Motivational Moments, and putting them in the neighbor's mailbox. I'm building my market, just like 'The Secret' author Rhonda Byrne, and Oprah.  She says it's 'embarrassing' for her. Why should she be embarrassed, it's my name on the Motivational Moments that get sent out?  She's just a 'Lizard Brain'. Mr. Godin moved me with his rhetoric to not listen to such Short Term Thinking, and to do what I want. I too will buy a big black suit and big black glasses, and look like the mascot for Six Flags. It's fun! and it's the True Me.     I cannot thank the Divine Seth Godin enough for this extremely motivational, moving, emotional, and gut-wrenching Work of Art! People across the country are dropping out and 'creating In'.  In fact, that was my last 'Motivational Moment', titled 'Sponsor a Neighborhood 'Create-In' '.  I invited them all over to my house to brainstorm Art Ideas.    yes, this book is well worth any fines you incur from borrowing it from the library.  It's a winner. Who wants to die with a Pension, a House, and Food. That's so old school, so security-needy.  Nope, i'm selling everything, and realizing my dream. Because Mr. Godin has convinced me that the only thing stopping me, is me. If i only have the Courage to Create, i will have the Market to Purchase My Art.    I guess all those 'Starving Artist' sales at the local hotel are full of artists who didn't truly 'believe' in themselves. Or they probably 'sold-out' by not doing art they believe in.  I guess all the 70% of business that fail every three years didn't truly 'believe' in the business, but started it for selfish reasons, instead of a Love of Humanity. If you start a business, and show Love to your customers, you'll succeed beyond your wildest dreams! Just like Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard, because he Believed in his product. Not like the founder of 'Friendster', the precursor to 'Facebook'. That business-failing loser didn't 'believe' in his product. Or any of the other hundreds of thousands of business owners who close shop and find themselves at the starting line again. What a great place to be, the Starting Line! Beginning over again, what an opportunity!    American Readers must be really stupid, because Mr. Godin keeps writing the same ideas over and over and over and over again, in book after book after book. yet, these dumb, stupid, American People can't seem to understand what he said in the 1st book he wrote on this topic of \\"Believe In Yourself\\". Or the 2nd. Or the 3rd. Or the 21st.  Thank God Mr. Godin has Persistence! He won't stop writing the same book with a new title and cover until he convinces everyone to be like him. What Courage he has!    I'm glad he doesn't include such 'Lizard Brain' information like Small Business Failure Rates, and other statistics provided free from US Commerce Dept. Such information is such a downer, ya know! I'm so glad he doesn't give information like \\"how to tell a good idea from a bad idea\\", and other critical thinking concepts. Because Mr. Godin knows that Critical Thinking is Stinkin Thinkin. Why, any system that helps sort 'truth' from 'delusion' doesn't have a place in such a rosy place as The Future Of Your Success.  Plato, Schopenhauer, Wittgenstein, and other philosophers who spent their lives trying to separate a True Statement from a False Statement were just lizard brains. Thank goodness, none of their thinking, and no concepts from the Critical Thinking discipline make it into this book. This is a book of Happiness, Joy, Creativity, and Success! There is no place for judgment, studies of past failures, and probability analysis in such a warm book as this. Why, i have no idea what those people study at harvard business school. It's so easy to succeed. Success is a mental decision. You control success, in any form you define it. The only limits to your success are the ones you impose on it.       I believe Mr. Godin must have watched the movie 'Glengary GlenRoss', because his 'Linchpin' is just like the speech Alec Baldwin gives in 'Glengary GlenRoss'. If you  haven't seen that speech, it's on YouTube (keywords 'glengarry glen ross baldwin')      let me leave you with this: The only reason you're not happy, is because you allow fear of security, comfort, food, clothing, shelter to hold you back. Stop it! Only Artists and Creative People are rich and happy. And art is whatever you make.

B00136RV66|5.0|After I saw that beautiful film, I immediately got the soundtrack and listened to it every day for more that 2 years. I just loved it! I still do! However, I have one criticism. I mp3 downloaded The Love Theme, one of my most favorite tracks. On that track when the melody changes to the violins, striking of the bows to the strings could be heard. That striking gave a magnificent poignance to the composition. It is like the striking of the heart strings with the realization of love. I'm not hearing it on the mp3 download. If it has bee taken out, please put it back!It was absolute genius and what I remember most about that beautiful music, by one of my all time favorite composers. The striking of the heart strings!

Doakes is following him everywhere and just to add a little more pressure, divers discover Dexter's dark dumping ground.    Great performances by everyone, especially Keith Carradine and Jaime Murray as one of the best psycho girlfriends on TV.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|It was all over with this record...the Beatles were done. Even though `Let it Be' was released in 1970, this was the last recorded music of the Beatles, the most influential band rock music will ever know. What a way to go out, some of the best songwriting and musicianship the band the would ever produce. It was well documented that the Beatles were essentially broken apart by this time...four talented individuals in the process of moving on. But, with the brilliance of producer George Martin they managed to put together a most cohesive and very 'Beatlesque' record. 'Come Together' never gets old and sounds as if it were recorded today. Then comes George Harrison's `Something' which is arguably the best song of his career. No better one-two punch exists to open any record. I have to admit that `Maxwell' and `Octopus' are filler when compared with the rest of the album. But,`Oh Darling' showcases McCartney's vocal talents unlike any song to that point in time. 'Here Comes the Sun' is another standout Harrison song that rivals his best and it's easy to see he is in his creative peak at this time. It was just a few months later that he released `All Things Must Pass'; regarded as his best record as a solo artist. The side-two medley follows 'Here Comes the Sun' and while it might be un-finished songs strung together...it works brilliantly! McCartney's voice was never better and the guitar interplay, drum work, vocal harmonies and energy all merge together to send the Beatles out on an exquisidly high note. While I enjoy `Let it Be', it's fitting that the most significant musical artists of our time were able to produce this masterpiece as their final statement.
030746363X|3.0|Let me start out by saying that I'm a huge Tim Ferris fan and have multiple copies of 4WW, 4WW revised, 4HB, and read his blog regularly. That being said I find it very difficult to jump on the bandwagon and give this book a 5 star review.     The book is broken down into a \\"choose your own adventure\\" style where there is no need to read the whole thing being to end. You read the first couple of chapters then jump to what you are most interested in. That section will give you some advice on achieving the goal.  So if your goal was weight loss you could choose the subtracting fat section and read all about a losing weight. The weight loss program recommended is basically the Paleo Diet with some of Tim's favorite recipes. If you wanted to build muscle you jump to that section and read about Tim's experiment with a butchered Colorado Experiment workout.     The main problem I have (hence the 3 star review) is that the book is really just a collection of blog post with the comments from readers and Tim wrapped up into a chapter. There really isn't much more meat to it than that. Most of the content is verbatim from the blog and really doesn't add much value.  The second problem I have with the book is that the advice given is frequently inconsistent throughout the book. For instance the Slow Carb Diet says no dairy, skip a few chapters and you come across the building muscle chapter and GOMAD (Gallon of Milk a Day) is recommended along with some comments about how great milk is. I understand that they are two different goals but it really should be a matter of food volume not food types that change in a weight loss / weight gain approach from the same author. Which brings me to my third issue...  Nothing in the book is \\"by Tim Ferris\\". Everything is his experience or one of his friends experience with some radical method of achieving a goal. I like his scientific approach to documenting the results but if you are really left with no more information than you started with on most subjects other than one more person's opinion.    Bottom line is if you like Tim Ferris then buy his book and support him, if you are looking to lose weight or gain muscle pick a more proven system and go with that. If you are just curious about the subject from all the marketing go search his 4 hour work week blog and read it there. You might even get to just watch the video and save yourself more time.
B0000029AP|4.0|You can take Aerosmith's career and split it into two distinct phases; the 70's and then the 80's and beyond. The first phase was that of a young rock band living in the murky world of booze and drugs which culminated in their decline and ultimate break-up by 1979. The music at this time was less commercial and more bluesy in influence. There were some hits like `Dream On' and `Walk This Way' but the music was certainly more AOR than Top 40. The second phase saw a cleaned up Aerosmith with Steven Tyler and Joe Perry (known as the `Toxic Twins' for their legendary drug use) more focused and energetic than the 70's version of  the band. Certainly, the reincarnation of Aerosmith was better known, more successful and longer lasting. The year 1986 saw an interesting re-invention of `Walk This Way' in the hip-hop meets rock Run D.M.C. collaboration with Aerosmith. From 1987 onwards the band got on an amazing winning streak the likes of which rarely occur and certainly not from a bunch of washed up junkies. Pretty amazing really. But, for a few productive years in the mid-70's Aerosmith was America's answer to the Rolling Stones. And, `Toys in the Attic' was along with 'Rocks' their most consistent statements of the decade. Opening with the raucous title track it moves through nine songs that includes the aforementioned `Walk This Way' and as well arguably their best song of all time, `Sweet Emotion'. The only throw-way is `Big Ten Inch Record' which while funny is a song the record could do without. If you are only familiar with the bands output in the 80's and 90's you owe it to yourself to listen to the band in all their pre-MTV glory.

The 4-hour body is a NO B.S. guide to attaining the most desired characteristics, including strength, speed, endurance, recovery, and overall health.  Tim cites the most credible sources in this book, giving you what works instead of what leaves you confused and without results.  The only reason I regret buying this book is that it's made me realize how much time I've been wasting in regards to my fitness and nutrition goals!
B000000W5L|5.0|Often tabbed as The Stones 'greatest' record ever; I think it's definitely in their best three (Let it Bleed and Sticky Fingers as well) and that's tough to beat. It contains enough musical styles to show-off the Stones' virtuosity and was a showcase for Mick Taylor's work. Taylor is often forgotten but his influence and playing were good enough to mark his time during the band's peak years (69-72). Not many bad songs here and it's a great representation of the Stones at the very pinnacle of their career.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|This is the best Batman film adaptation ever created! Dark Knight was wonderful and it is the second best now that this film is around. Watching it is as if the pages of a Batman comic had sprung to life right before your eyes. And what life! The Animation is beautiful motion picture quality, I think Warner Animation should continue to create WELL WRITTEN! Beautifully Animated films and put them out theatrically to give adults an alternative to Disney/Pixiar! Not that I don't love their films too but Animation should become a medium of story telling instead of simply a kids genre.<br />Anyway a wonderful film that really captures everything that Batman is. If you are a fan you will really enjoy this. As for the complaint about this film not being bloody or gory enough, I really don't see why it would be, it is not a SAW film, its an animated character driven Drama about the things that matter in a excellently told, emotions character development, empathy, and amazing animation.<br /><br />To the creators of this film I simply ask that you continue to create these wonderful rich well made films and keep pushing the envolpe as far as writing! that is what great film making is all about!
B00192IV9U|5.0|I love this album!  After just one listen I'm already hooked.  I think it's unfair for people to compare this album to Michael's previous albums.  The days of any album with Michael's music on it being finished with the perfection and approval of Michael Jackson ended on June 25, 2009.  However, I think of this album as a way to honor his enduring legacy, it seems more like a tribute, which is fine with me.  Quite honestly in my opinion, I think it's much better than other chart toppers out there.      I thought all the songs were great but \\"(I can't make it) Another Day\\", really stood out for me, there so much raw angst in Michael's voice. I already loved \\"Hold my Hand\\", I like the message and I thought Michael and Akon's voices fused together nicely. \\"Hollywood tonight\\" was interesting to hear him sing in the lower register.  \\"The way that you love me\\" is not really a new song but a newer version, I think that song really deserved to be an more than just a compilation album like it was previously so I'm glad it was included even it wasn't a \\"new song\\" like was promised.    This album is definately worth the money!
B002HFP0R4|5.0|The Bee Gees long-awaited 4-disc retrospective \\"Mythology\\" is a superb box set with one disc devoted to an indiviual Brother Gibb (#1-Barry,#2-Robin,#3-Maurice,#4-Andy),containing 28 of all their 39 Top 40 hits,10 of which went to #1, with plenty of terrific deep cuts abound(especially on the Maurice and Andy discs). It also features a beautiful booklet containing a great assortment of rare photographs with notes from the Barry and Robin Gibb,friends and family,testimonies from everyone from Elton John,fifth Beatle George Martin,Brian Wilson,Burt Bacharach,Olivia Newton-John,Kenny Rogers,Frankie Valli to Celine Dion,Taylor Swift,Justin Timberlake and even Robert Smith of the Cure(!). The remastering,done by Dan Hersch & Andrew Sandoval,show a vast improvment over the original Polydor Bee Gee CDs and the late-90's reissues of Andy Gibb's three studio albums,showing more clarity,spaciousness and warmth than ever. For any Bee Gee fan,this set's a no-brainer.

0374290024|5.0|This is history as it should be written.  Morris focuses on the patterns, relative to social development.  He leavens the story with his humanism, humor, and personal experiences as an archaeologist.  He is remarkably well read, and for those subjects I have read more extensively in, I can vouch for his accuracy - well maybe he fails to note some of Genghis Khan's positive achievements amidst all the horror (cf. book by Jack Weatherford).  He separates observations from opinion, and defends his opinions fairly.        I am skeptical of the \\"hard ceiling\\" which may be a result of the way Morris is measuring things.   Morris owes a huge debt to Jared Diamond and his \\"Gun, Germs and Steel\\"; it is interesting that Diamond is not a professional historian either.        Morris deliberately omits much discussion of the Indian sub-continent which simplifies things, thankfully.  However, many economists (cf. Yasheng Huang, \\"Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics\\") believe India will overtake China in this century:  both because of demography, and because it employs capital much more efficiently.      If you have not read the book, I would warn you that some of the early material is not as good as the rest of the book.  The early theoretical discussion tends to be repetitive, and I believe Morris goes into more detail than necessary in describing the power shifts in the \\"middle east\\" prior to 600 BCE.  As another reader points out, Morris also spends a lot of time early in the book refuting the racial explanation for relative progress, which is unnecessary for many readers.
B0045NXMJE|4.0|Jean Pierre Jeunet is one crazy film director. His thought processes are entirely singular. Watching one of his movies is like watching a Rube Goldberg machine. All these goofy things happen, along a circuitous route, but in the end it all works.     Micmacs might not be his best best movie but it's still a lot of fun to watch. The basic outline of the plot is fairly simple. The film's hero, Bazil (played delightfully by Dany Boon) has a bullet lodged in his noggin. He got it as an innocent bystander in a robbery attempt. If the doctors yank the bullet he could become a vegetable. If they leave it in he could die. The decision is made by the flip of a coin. Also, he lost his father to a land mine. So now, with the help of a loose-knit family of people, occupying space in a junk yard, (they are the Micmacs of the title) he tries to bring down the two arms manufacturers responsible for the bullet and the land mine. They devise an intricat plot, fueled by an array of weird gadgets honed together from detritus in the junk yard, to do the deed.    Jeunet uses a similar color palette to the one he used in 'A very Long Engagement' with a lot of yellows and golds. As usual, it's a great looking movie where not a frame is wasted. It has the usual array of crazy characters and great attention is given to even the most minute of details.    Where it falters a bit is in the script. The beginning is a bit clunky. Not enough time is given to our meeting the Micmacs and his building a relationship with them. They \\"adopt\\" him, and in a heartbeat, they're off on their mission. Also, this movie is set in the here and now so his sense of whimsy doesn't work as well as it has in his other films. As a jaded society, we realize that there is no way these people will get anywhere near enough to these arms manufacturers to pull off their stunt. He also needed to do a better job building the romance between Bazil and the contortionist. That all happens just a bit too quickly.    That beingsaid, this is still a wild ride. If you're already a fan of his or Terry Gilliam or Tim Burton you should have a fine time with this.
030746363X|5.0|The Four Hour Body is outstanding.  I really loved The Four Hour Work Week and Tim has done it again.  Although there are other books on similar topics, what really separates Tim's work from others out there is that his work is based on doing more with less.  Tim is a real pioneer in testing basic assumptions and asking, What if I did the opposite?  Even if you didn't do anything Tim suggests in his new book, it's still an interesting and entertaining read.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|When I rented Black Christmas from my local video store, I thought that I was picking some blaxploitation flick. How wrong I was. There aren't even any black people in this movie. Black Christmas is actually an early slasher movie with no blood, but lots of suspense. Some parts of this movie actually scared me, which isn't easy since I'm a masculine manly man. It was released the same year as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's movies like this that make you understand why the phrase \\"They don't make them like that any more\\" was coined. It's not a perfect movie. There are plenty of slow parts. Not really boring, just slow. The second best Christmas slasher, after Silent Night, Deadly Night.
B00136LVWQ|5.0|THE STROKES! I love these guys. Is This It ranked #3 on my favorite albums of the decade, after Arcade Fire's Funeral and Radiohead's In Rainbows.    Is This It received RAVE reviews. It has like a 90 something on Metacritic. So, how does their second album hold up to the first? Just as well. In fact, some of these songs are stronger than some of the songs on the last album. But, somehow, this album is missing the hot New Yorkers air about it that made it what it was. Do I recommend it? Yes. Do I give it five stars? Yes. Why? It's damn awesome. The End Has No End, The Way It Is, Reptilia, Automatic Stop, and What Ever Happend are excellent songs that could have been on the first.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I saw Inception at the movie theatres and I was very impressed. Some have shot it down as pretentious and lacking in substance.     The way I saw it was as a heist film, with some psycho-thriller elements.     The product itself is great. The menu is well designed, the resolution is as gorgeous as can be on Blu Ray. The bonus features are great, and it even includes the soundtrack, which I personally loved.  At the current price of $17, this is as good a deal as you're gonna get, in my opinion. It also includes the DVD and the digital copy, which seems to be the standard MO nowadays for Blu Ray.    I personally loved the film. I thought the acting was very good, solid work from Watanabe and Page. I would not call it DiCaprio's best work (I would have to refer you to Revolutionary Road, or maybe the Beach, for that) but I thought he added to the end product. The soundtrack I thought was great, simple enough that it can be mocked beautifully (see South Park episode \\"Insheeption\\" for an artful parody of Inception...it was great!) but it really is a powerful soundtrack. The set designs were generic, nothing to write home about, but that was for the most part intentional.     I can't really go into this film without ranting and raving in a way that would not make me seem like a crazy person, so I will leave it at this: if you liked the movie in the theatres, this is a must have.
B00433TO52|5.0|I am very happy with this collection, especially considering these new plays! Marvelous stuff! Also, I found the table of contents to be really nice, useful and simple to navigate!...I am very excited about reading these new works...I have my favorite Shakespeare plays and poems, like any fan. I always loved 'My mistresses eyes are nothing like the sun...' and my favorite plays are Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and Midsummer Night's Dream...With this collection, what is really exciting me is that I can't wait to see if any of the new plays are good enough to get into the top favorite positions...We'll see...
030746363X|5.0|- A healthy mind in a healthy body, a point which can not be stressed enough, known since antiquity, and Tim interprets this in his own ways and makes it relevant for Internet Natives and others alike.  - Many isolated known facts, all brought together in one place with massive encouragement to get going - again - at a healthier lifestyle.  - Encouragement because it actually CAN be done and he proves it.  - Seeing the person as a whole, living life at its' fullest, using the bodies' full potential in every sense.  - Encouragement to self-test and to try out for yourself.  - Some really cool new insights as well.    => Overall a great read, funny - actually laugh-out-loud funny at times - , a real page turner PLUS a great reference book when putting your own programme together. Not all chapters will look equally interesting to everybody but at the very least they are a very interesting read.    So to me this is a great book: motivating, informative, practical, entertaining and funny. What more could you ask for from a book?
B0043A0PXU|5.0|First, I have to say I loved the title of another review referring to Annie's voice as an instrument.  I have long said that Annie's voice was the best instrument on any Eurythmics recording.  Of course, that also applies to her solo work.  While Annie's voice is starting to show a bit of age, it is only a bit, and she sounds as beautiful as ever.    Obviously, this is a somewhat biased review.  I have followed Annie and Dave from the Tourists to their solo careers.  I even have the Vegas album.  Proceed with my review keeping that in mind.    In the album notes, Annie states that she does not adhere to any particular religion.  Nevertheless, she shows more reverence for the biblical account of the birth of Christ than do most self-proclaimed Christians.  This is a very traditional recording, and as a Christian, I love it for the content most of all.  To me, it seems that Annie is worshipping or praising in her own way, and I find the album uplifting beyond words.  The new track penned by Annie, Universal Child, fits in seamlessly and should be a classic as well.    I hope I don't seem like a religious fanatic, our nativity includes the Abominable Snowman.  However, I have a six year old daughter who I am trying to teach about Christmas.  I weary of hearing all about reindeer, toys and Santa Claus, especially when I know that too many of my daughters little friends will not be visited by Santa Claus this year.  As I try to explain to my daughter how fortunate we are, and how we should be giving to other people who are less fortunate, I appreciate the beautiful \\"gift\\" Annie gave with this record filled with faith, love and hope rather than wasted on commercial nonsense.    I have gone on about the lyrics and the message of the album, because that is what is most important to me for the reasons stated above.  I apologize to those of you who did not find that helpful.    As for the music, I was pleasantly surprised.  Based on a few of the reviews, I half expected to hear someone plonking on a harpsichord while sheep bleated in the background.  As a devoted fan of all things Annie and Dave, I would say that this album most closely resembles the highly under-rated Peace album by the Eurythmics, followed by Annie's Songs of Mass Destruction.  As I alluded to, Annie's voice takes center stage.  Although I would describe the album as traditional, I also found it instantly accessible, and loved every track the first time I listened to the album.  I think this record could be played alongside one of the hit Christmas albums by Amy Grant, although I do prefer Annie.    If you mainly remember Annie for Sweet Dreams or Here Comes The Rain Again, or if you are hoping for a follow up to the brilliant Winter Wonderland from A Very Special Christmas, you may be disappointed.  At least at first.  This is not a synth record.  It is more organic.  The arrangements are a bit understated, allowing Annie to do what she does best.    I stated in my title that this was the best Christmas record of the year.  Honestly, I shouldn't say that.  While I have purchased five new titles in the last 2 weeks, Cornucopia has not left the CD player and is on continual play on my ipod.  I should get on to the others, but this one is soooo good.    Thanks for taking the time to read, and most of all, Merry Christmas!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never gotten so many compliments before about being so fit.  I used to spend hours in the gym, but not get the overall shape that I get from 30 Day Shred.  I combine this with about a 1-2 mile run about 3-4 days/week and it is amazing how quickly I tone up from it.       I think it takes a strong mental commitment to stick with it because it's not easy, but it's definitely worth it.
0061730335|5.0|Kamkwamba, W. & Mealer, B. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. (New York: HarperCollins, 2009). 273 pages         \\"Within a few meters, I entered the scrap yard and stopped. Behold! Now that I had an actual purpose and a plan, I realized how much bounty lay before me.\\" William Kamkwamba, is an inspiring an innovative young man from Malawi who was driven by a combination of natural curiosity, resilience, optimism, fierce determination,  and the dire circumstances of a nation-wide starvation. His autobiography tells of his quest to bring electricity to his home and village with the goal of having light and for bringing irrigation in order to avoid another famine. Through library books he was inspired to build a windmill to create electricity. He used the scraps and garbage around him - bottle caps, old pipes, discarded wire, broken bicycles and wood - and built his windmill by hand. He not only had the physical struggle of famine and the economic challenges of poverty; he also had a limited and interrupted education while surrounded by a culture of superstition and fear. Even so, he opened his mind up to the possibilities of science while being thought of as a crazy person; some of the villagers even threatened William, accusing him of creating a \\"witch tower\\" which was causing the drought. He has learned to navigate two parallel worlds.         William's curiosity and drive were inspiring, and at times, humorous.  He told of the importance of radios - the only connection to the world outside of the village. He became fascinated with how voice could be transmitted, so he and his cousin began experimenting, \\"...since we learned everything through experimenting, a great many radios were sacrificed for our knowledge...we learned from our mistakes.\\" Through his story we learn about a different world where resources are not taken for granted. The account of the famine is stark and haunting. William is a great example of the potential within each of us when we have a \\"purpose and a plan.\\" Read it and weep, laugh and be inspired.
1439107955|5.0|seeking an understanding of cancer. I've read some of the other reviews here on AmazonUSA and think others have written far better reviews than I can. Reviewers who have had cancer, for instance, or those who are in the oncology field. As an interested lay reader, I found that Dr Mukherjee has answered questions I have had - and maybe didn't even know I had! - in a well-written, almost conversational manner. He was able to explain cancer in terms I actually understand.<br /><br />The only quibble I might have with the book is the choice of wording for Dr Mukherjee's subtitle, \\"A biography of Cancer\\". I'd suggest a better subtitle - considering the contents of the book - might be \\"A history of the advances in understanding and treating cancer\\".

You could go out and try to get each and every season on its own, and piecing them together MIGHT get you a deal like this. Still, if you missed out and you want to wathc it then you are going to really want to see it all. Itt is an addictive show and it has things in it that HAVE to be followed up. If you miss a piece you miss a lot, so having all the seasons here is a great opprotunity.

From the roots of the series and the rocky start of our very nefarious cop to the end of everything and the way the dominoes fall is beautiful. I honestly had no idea what would happen. You get to knwo these people,a ll of them, and you get to know everyone else in the unit to. you see \\"The Barn\\" for what it is; a group of personalities that have their own lives and their own problems and their own ways of doing things. some of them are simply people trying to get by while others - well, they are walking slopes that really seem dangerous.

B000WTXD30|5.0|This collection contains 34 of Sir Elton John's greatest hits over 32 years.  It sure does take you back, doesn't it?  This collection doesn't contain but a couple of pieces of fodder - almost everyone of the 34 pieces is truly an original masterpiece that was a best seller and recognized as great.  If you listen closely, you can hear a slight difference in his singing from his younger years to \\"middle age\\", nevertheless, it's great.  His songs are generally unique one to the next, unlike many musicians who simply repeat success.  You needn't worry yourself over that.  As with all MP3 downloads, it's so easy to download, listen, transport ...  The price is a bit more than most Greatest Hits \\"albums\\" but, the price per song is the same, as the # of hits is greater (and, in this, it's almost all super hits).  I'd love to see one comprehensive collection up through a given year.  HA!  This is an excellent Christmas gift for folks who've lived through the same time as he has.  It's interesting music for music theory classes.  I give everything a grade, and, this collection is truly worthy of an \\"A+\\".
030746363X|5.0|Tim promised a book that was easy to consume, broken down into digestible sections and meant to be used as a reference guide - not read as a novel.  Additionally this was to be chocked full of new approaches, new thinking and blasting wide-open old myths about genetics, healing injuries and the list goes on.  Tim completely delivers everything he said.  From one tip alone, found on page 281, I slept better the FIRST night after reading this .. and now I can make that repeatable.  THIS is the THE book to have on fitness in your home library.  Highly recommended!  What?  There isn't a 6-star review?  I'd could've used some more cowbell and another star to review this one :)
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I've owned a pair of SONY's MDR-7506 headphones since April of 2009 and find them to be very much as advertised. They've got a wide frequency range and perform well with units having flea power output. With a bit of plug position finagling, they'd probably work satisfactorily with an old-fashioned transistor radio --that's how sensitive they are-- yet these 'phones handle the highest volume levels without distortion. They've got rich bass tone and clean high end.<br /><br />DOWNSIDE:<br />They fit on your head like a clamp. After about 30 minutes the pressure can be annoying.<br /><br />Like a bicycle tire, the leather ear pads come off easier than they go on. If you're not careful, you can accidentally knock one off, which is what happened to me once. Getting it back on was a lesson in aggravation.<br /><br />Recently, the coiled main cord of my MDR-7506s got stuck between my couch and an end table. Although I didn't yank it brutally, the amount of pressure I did exert in trying to free it was enough to short out one of the channels. In a case like this, especially when they're out of warranty, SONY does not repair the headphones-- they only offer an eighty d&oacute;llar exchange, plus sales tax and shipping.<br /><br />If you are capable, it may be cheaper to buy a replacement cord, splice it in high on the wire, then solder and tape it up. The finished product won't look pretty, but you also won't be out another C note.

030746363X|5.0|Tim does it again!  The 4HB could be the most important book you read this decade.  Brilliantly written for everyone; Obese to Hulks and everyone in between.  Buy at least 2 copies because after the first chapter your going to think of someone you'd like to give one to.

B003Z9Q4WG|4.0|At Amazon's price this is a great value. You get 60 CD's for about $1.60 per disc. There are some items here that have been deleted or are hard (or expensive) to find like the Hindemith Symphony in E flat. The sound recording is generally good but you have to realize these were made between 1953 and 1976. The only thing I don't like is the packaging. It comes in a bulky 12x12 box with 60 CD's in four compartments that are stacked. This makes it a little clumsly to get the CD you want but for the price I guess I should not complain that much. In any event, its worth buying.
B003ZHQVJO|3.0|Ok, so I am a HUGE Kid Rock fan, have all his CD's, see him in concert whenever he is within a reasonable distance and I was looking so forward to this CD.  But I have to say the Kid is getting soft.  This CD is so mellow and unlike Kid Rock, I don't think there is one single cuss word on this CD and the missing Twisted Brown Truckers band really sucked.  I personally love Kid for his raw and gritty style with the TBT as his band.  The new music is more tinny sounding and just not right.  I listened to the CD once, it has a couple of ok songs but I'll tuck this one away and pull out Cocky or Rock 'n' Roll Jesus and dream of the old Kid Rock that got me pumped up when I listened to him.  C'mon Kid, you're not that old?!?  PLEEEEEAAAASSSSE Kid make another rockin' CD, I'm not giving up on you yet, prove us wrong and come back with some of your bad ass music WITH the Twisted Brown Truckers and those lyrics that made you the dirty white bad boy I fell in love with.
1615238948|1.0|The premise of this book is unreal and shows a lack of understanding of the way slaves were considered.  No matter how low born, the child was white and always considered superior to blacks. She never would have been \\"given\\" to black servants to train.
0061537969|5.0|First off, this book is a pleasant read.  Plain and simple.  You can put the book down to go about your day to day things and pick it back up again and you'll fall right into place.... but believe me, you won't want to put it down.  It doesn't matter if you're not a fan of racing.  I'm not and I still found this book to be incredibly wonderful.  Enzo's view of the world in wise and insightful without being preachy or so deep that it makes your head hurt. I was all prepared for the tugging of the heartstrings and was determined I would not get emotional, I had psyched myself up.  Didn't work.  And its not even for the reasons that I was thinking I would get emotional.  Read the book.  You'll see.
0439023513|1.0|That must be the lamest ending in literature.  Oops, sorry.  The lamest ending in who-cares, just-send-me-my-paycheck fiction.  Collins' ideas are running out by the third book.  But, for most of Mockingjay, she plods ahead anyway.  Then the editor must have called and said, \\"Yo, Suzanne.  Deadline tomorrow, right?\\"  Because the last few chapters seem completely out of place and completely unedited.  The characters are different, the style is different, the message is different....  Horrible.  I really enjoyed the first two books.  I am hoping that this cash-me-out, rushed ending doesn't tarnish the memory of them.
B00428ZRFE|4.0|I'm a huge Rihanna fan. I love her and I wish she'd make another Rated R album. But this will do. I love the fact that she is happy. My favorite song on here is skin and her singles are hot but other than that the album is nice.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This story is absolutely fascinating. It's filled with the most interesting combinations of innocence and darkness, what is said and not said, tragedy and love. This book is filled with so many moments that will physically move you. I couldn't stop thinking about these characters long after I put it down. If done correctly, this could be a brilliant movie. I will be recommending this one to many for a long time.
030746363X|4.0|You have to know what to expect with Tim. He is a lifehacker and this is ultimately a lifehack book. Are you submerging yourself in ice baths because of reading it? Not likely. Was it entertaining to read? Yes.<br /><br />This is not a diet book. It is a hack your body book. There is some great info in it and you have to apply what works.<br /><br />Read 4 Hour Workweek if you haven't too.<br /><br />Tim is great for challenging you to go farther in life. He did it with Biz in the last book and now he is doing it with the Body.<br /><br />If you are looking for a step 1-30 book this isn't it. You wouldn't follow through with it anyway.<br /><br />Don't take his science 100% to heart and take this as the bible on how to do it all right. This is a result of him hacking his body and interesting results he has seen from it.<br /><br />Take the good info and be entertained by the rest.
030746363X|5.0|Just buy it.  The info contained in it is well worth the asking price...as well as not having to spend the time Tim did to find the results.
B00004NHCC|5.0|This album with Sarah Vaughn  and Clifford Brown is a match made in heaven. Though some of Sarah's recordings with lush orchestrations can be a bit over the top, this one hits the perfect tone, with Clifford Brown's pared down and thoughtful accompaniment. There's lots of really good reviews here already so no need to repeat what's been said. As far as I'm concerned,though, her version of 'April in Paris' on this album is the definitive one for this standard, sung with both longing and melancholy--and at a perfect languid tempo.

B003U0AHBO|5.0|I have watched all the other Robin Hood movies, and I'm currently in progress of reading Stephen Law's King Raven trilogy (Hood-Scarlet-Tuck). Having heard that this movie was a \\"darker\\" tale of Robin Hood, I did not know what to expect. I found that I really enjoyed it! While the theatrical version did not go into detail on Robin's \\"merry men\\" as expected from all the other Robin Hood movies (Errol Flynn, Kevin Costner, etc), I particularly liked manner in which the movie handled Crowe's meeting the old Locksley, and Marian. It seemed much more realistic than other movies, and more likely!    I would highly recommend watching this movie.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Purchased in gold box for $10 on blu-ray.  I didn't own the DVD version of this so I wasn't upgrading.<br /><br />First, I like that the movies are sticking closer to the events in the books.  After the debacle that was Goblet of Fire, this and The Order of the Phoenix were refreshing breaths of fresh air.  The series does take a dark turn (as it has been since the 3rd film).  Without going into the plot and events, suffice to say this film is full of surprises and shockers (for those who haven't read the book).<br /><br />At $34.99 I might have cringed a bit, but the Blu-Ray transfer is very nice.  I play on a Toshiba 49\\" LCD 1080p through my PS3 and it looks great.  If you already own the DVD and want to upgrade to the HD version, then I would recommend it.  Just not for the MSRP.  Wait for a better price like I did!<br /><br />Movie - 5 stars<br />Blu-Ray Transfer - 5 stars<br />Extras - 4 or 5 stars (lots of extra content)<br /><br />Of note:  I did not see any of the black bands that a few other reviewers mentioned.  It may have been a bad initial batch or something intermittent.<br /><br />Also, this doesn't really follow the book very well, but the director is trying to pack a lot of content into a finite film length, so sometimes sacrifices must be made.  I for one am glad that it is not 100% by the book.  Like the other Potter films, I appreciate that the heart and soul of the books is there, which other films fail miserably to capture.
B0029ZA3H4|4.0|I just finished this book, and found it relevant and interesting.  I am a physician with a good job looking at 'what's next' career-wise for me.  I don't hate my job, I think I could be doing a number of other things and I am exploring what my own talents might be, and how I might create a new business that would be inspiring and financially successful.  I really do agree with one of the reviewers--there is no 'formula' in this book that is necessarily going to work for everyone, maybe not even a majority of people.  Actually, I don't think there is such a thing as a formula for much of anything worthwhile in life (like relationship).  BUT, you can learn from someone else's shared experience, particularly when (as Gary uses the term)what they are sharing is 'authentic.' Having run 2 medical practices over the past 30 years, both successfully (and with many challanges), I did come away with some very cogent ideas from the book.  Let's face it, 'follow your passion' isn't exactly a new idea (see Joseph Campbell, in the 80's if you really want to be inspired). But I was impacted by the idea and possibility of creating a far reaching community where some of my talents and commitments are currently wasted in the current model of healthcare.  Maybe there are people out there that are interested in how well their physician listens or communicates, or how well trained their doctor is, or any number of other attributes that don't carry much wieght with 'bottom line oriented' healthcare organizations or medical insurance companies.  One of my problems is how to leverage my skills and talent, and talk about subjects I can really talk about and that I really understand, with people who care about it.  But the important thing is that this book started me REALLY thinking about what I could do, and how I might do it.  To a 60 year old doc with a traditional education who has been in business a long time, it was definitely worth the read and the few bucks.  If something makes me think in new ways, I consider that very valuable, and why I gave it 4 stars.  PS, why I didn't give it 5 stars is that, like any business strategy, there is potential to abuse it--in fact I think you can count on that.  You have to remember that 'authenticity' thing! What I'm saying that there is a downside to 'using' the community strategy for your own gains, or manipulating it.  And (as the book says), people can sniff that out.  Good job to the reviewer who did.ink in new ways, I consider that very valuable, and why I gave it 4 stars.

1591843162|1.0|I got the audio version and have been listening to it with my wife while we do weekend errands. We both agree that it is very interesting for about five minutes. The problem is that the same point (note: not points) is repeated without end. It's a book designed to make outcasts feel a sympathetic bond. You are special. You don't have to take it from the man. You can change an organization. The problem is that he never gets to the point of how to do so. Or at least, not within the first hour of the CD that we listened to. This was a 100% waste of money and time.

So what was the problem with the Expendables? No plot line, no acting, no story, no nothing. Why? Who knows I mean he had every super star action hero in the world. It happens when you gather enough talent to kid yourself into the delusion that you can make a movie without a script. SORRY IT DON'T WORK THAT WAY. Loss $400,000,000 not to mention his fading Hollywood capatil.  Don't waste your time, money, or sanity. SKIP THIS ONE...
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I used the Ergotron to get my LCD closer to my face and away from the speakers in my music studio.  It did the job perfectly.  The arm is very attractive and functional.  I would recommend it to anyone using the style of desk I have.  I posted a picture of the arm attached to my mixing desk, so please have a look.  The part of the arm that attaches to the LCD itself pivots in many directions, so you can position the screen perfectly after setting the arm distance and height.<br /><br />The idea that these arms free up desk space is a partial truth.  Once the monitor is in front of you, its usually so large that the space behind i obstructed.  You might store little used items behind it, but if they are little used they should probably be somewhere else, anyway.
B004132HZS|5.0|If there were more stars I would have to use them all to properly review this outstanding new series.  How do you modernize Holmes and not lose what made Holmes great to begin with?  How do you give Watson a background that makes him a real contributor to this dynamic-duo?  These and other challenges are handled admirably in this latest and best of Sherlock recreations.  I feel this is THE best series on television.

B00192IV9U|1.0|Will.I.Am was right when he said he does not believe unreleased Michael Jackson material should be released to the public, as it does not have MJ's approval.  And without MJ to oversee an album bearing his name, what has Sony chosen to do?  Release 3 FAKE tracks featuring impersonator Jason Malachi, under the name of the legendary Michael Jackson.  What an unprecedented disgrace!!  There are alot of Elvis impersonators out there, but they aren't releasing songs under his name.  And the tracks aren't even MJ's style.  Never in a song has the King of Pop referred to himself in the third person, as Jason sings in \\"Breaking News\\".  As for the other tracks, they are poorly produced and clearly not up to Michael's standards.  Michael Jackson was a perfectionist, and he poured his heart into all of his work for over 40 years.  This album has the wrong name on it.  It should be released with a title reflecting what it is: SONY (or $ONY) not MICHAEL.    If this is what is to be expected from Sony concerning MJ's unreleased material, then as fans it's best to enjoy the MJ tracks released by the man himself when he was alive.  These new releases don't reflect him anyways.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|I'm not one of tim's friends reviwing the book. One of my friends was excited about before it's release so he got me thinking enough about it that I actually got it. I did notice 100+ positive reviews within minutes of the book being released. But I was okay with doing my own research. I read as Tim suggested buffet style through the diet and excersise sections. The diet is basically Atkins with a cheat day. I'm not sure how long one can sustain a diet like that, I was looking for a permanent diet not a yo yo type.  His weight training info is similar to others work on doing one set to failure, I've been working out long enough to know what works and doesn't. I was open to understanding his data but the problem is all his \\"subjects\\" are either obese or have never trained before. When you're really fat any change in diet and excersise will produce results. The same goes with if you never worked out, anyone who knows anything about working out knows that it's easiest to make big gains the first few months you ever start training. My thoughts are that just like his first book 4 hour work week this book presents false shortcuts that don't work long term. Although he does talk about the effect of cold on burning calories which was something I did not know. But then again mr. Hype also tells you that fruits and aerobic workouts are useless.<br /><br />7/10/12 update:<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit it, Tim's diet does work.  IF you follow it and do not stray the results will show.  I did it for 6 months and lost about 20 lbs (i was in decent shape before).  That may not seem like a lot, but after the initial slow start and tweeking the diet I started burning off fat and weight and in the end I \\"settled\\" at about 175-180 I started at 195.  The cheat day does help, it makes a big difference and helps you focus for the week.  Although expect to have a food coma if you go crazy on that day.  All in all I don't agree with Tim's self promotion and all the scam reviews that showed up within minutes, the guy does know what he's doing.  So I wanted to update my review to show that.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|I'm one of those people who loves all of the real Christmas classics: It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, A Christmas Carol, A Charlie Brown Christmas, Rudolph, Frosty the Snowman...I pretty well find a way to watch them every year.<br /><br />For some reason, though, I've never been so drawn to many of the more recent Christmas movies and specials. I've enjoyed some of them (especially Christmas Vacation and Bad Santa), but for the most part, they're silly and too light to spark that yearning to see them over and over. So, I've never adopted any of them into my annual viewing habit.<br /><br />Until Elf. It manages to play with and make fun of many of our zany and schmaltzy Christmas tropes, all the while indulging in them. As a result, it seems fresh every year (especially by comparison with whatever recent Christmas specials have just appeared) and is always fun, and it captures something of the holiday spirit better than all of those other films. We live in a silly time, and this is our era's silly but endearing contribution to the Christmas canon.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Avatar is a great movie to begin with.  The collector's Edition is a must to have. The only thing that's a problem is most laptops that have blu-ray drives don't have the right firmware to play the DVD.  Sony and Gateway could not supply the proper firmware to play.  They may now have it, but I got a blu-ray player for the TV and it played fine. Don't understand what the problem is, but be sure to check that the right firmware to play this DVD is available. Amazon was fast to ship it out to me without a hitch.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Overall, I really liked it, considering it can in no way really fulfill the book; however, I have 2 major complaints:  1) The conversation between Bella and Jacob before he goes to fight is totally gay.  They tried to cram in the intensity, yet turned it into something silly by changing how it all went.  The movie makes it appear as though she's pursuing him and didn't properly show how he was baiting her by talking about going out in a blaze of glory per say.  2)  The fight with Edward and Victoria and Riley.  They made Edward out to look like some sort of pansy that couldn't hold his own.  Not how it happened.  They also did this in New Moon when he scuffled with Felix (I do think Felix should've ultimately won, but it should've been more of a challenge than it was).    With that said, I loved most everything else!    Dear Amazon,  I will not pre-order anything from you in the future.  Other retailers ship it so that you RECEIVE it on the release date.  If others can do it why not you?  Very disappointing!
B00192IV9U|5.0|There has (as with anything having to do with Michael)been alot of noise about this album. Like I always do with news about Michael, I took it with a grain of salt and waited to judge for myself. I have been an MJ fan for as long as I can remember. I have always been a member of his fanclub, long before his death, saw most of his tours, bought all of his albums. One thing I know for sure about Michael is that he always wanted to be number One and there was no way I wasn't supporting this album and him. I was lucky to get a copy about one week before its release and I listened to it. Immediately I  was confused about all the controversy. I know Michaels voice. This album is Michael with alot of fillers. I still loved it. Hearing it for the first time brought tears to my eyes. I felt his earnest in \\"I can't make it another day\\". I heard his anger and regret in \\"Monster\\" and understood his heartache in \\"Much too soon \\". I think its hard to imagine an album without Michael's involvement but I think the producers did a good Job. I'm sure there is alot that he would change, but since he's no longer here to do so, I'm happy to accept his vocals along with all the unnecessary bells and whistles than No more new Michael. I can never get enough. R.I.P my king.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I remember when i was a little kid living in Puerto Rico and my Grandparents would talk about this film, about how great it was and how they don't make them like they used to, because it was black and white i never really took interest in it, until this year i started college and i got to see it, and i thought it was amazing. I bought the DVD and watched it with my grandparents and they still say its the best film ever made and i agree.    The DVD is a great buy and affordable.
0312600844|2.0|I was very disappointed in Freedom.  As I enjoyed The Corrections, I was looking forward to this novel.  The characters were unbelievable, the dialogue was trite and, though I finished it, it was tough slogging through.  Franzen developed too many weirdo characters--not one rang true.  I can't believed how hyped this book was and that Oprah picked it.  She usually does a better job.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great acting, production and story line. Everyone did a great job following in the footsteps of those who created the original characters. Chris Pine did a great job reinventing James Kirk and by not trying to copy William Shatner, breathes new life in to a favorite character.    The action is great, but is not overdone. The movie was well written, which is more than I can say for the last few movies that featured the TNG cast. They were all great on the tv series, but something was lost when it came to most of their big screen features. This movie has renewed my interest in the franchise.     A great piece of Star Trek to own.
030746363X|5.0|I finally got this gigantic book in my hands, it's packaged beautifully, not to mention the quality of content that it contains.

B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Updated on 3.4.11 from original review:<br /><br />I bought this to get streaming Nexflix Instant movies from my MacBook Air to my big flat screen HDMI TV. The adapter connects the MacBook mini displayport to the HDMI cable and then to the TV. Although this adapter is wired to carry the audio also, you should be aware that not all MacBook models actually have audio folded onto the HDMI output, and not all HDMI TV's will actually accept the audio. In my case, my Panasonic TV (only 1.5 years old), will not work with the Moshi and MBA for audio.<br /><br />This is not really a big problem for me since I want my audio (carried separately from the headphone output) to go directly into my sound system anyway, because my sound system is simple stereo. Be sure to check all your electronics for audio compatibility before ordering, because the HDMI standards and connectors have not yet been finalized, especially if your components are even as little as a year old.<br /><br />Using a separate audio cable, I was able to stream a Netflix movie with no problem. Although it's a bit expensive for a mere cable, it's less expensive than a Roku or Apple TV or Netflix enabled wireless Blu-Ray player, which are the alternatives.<br /><br />The other application which is gaining popularity these days to display your MacBook contents on a big display, to show photos, videos or PowerPoints; this replaces the conventional projector in the workplace.

0679746323|4.0|Like her previous book, Wild Swans, Jung Chang fills this one with keen insights into human nature.  The authors put together a strong argument for the first sentence in the book which basically describes Mao as the worst despot ever.  I do not doubt that the book is well researched.  However, I wish the authors would have provided citations and footnotes.  That would help to lend the strong anti-Mao message more credibility.  Maps at the beginning of the book are not very helpful.  However, Jung Chang's insights into human nature make this book an excellent read.
0316921173|5.0|DFW's masterpiece of post-modern fiction is a must-read.  The workings of addiction and dependence of all kinds (alcohol, drugs, sports, entertainment, intrigue, love, etc.) are explored with a dark hilarious honesty in a tale that had me engrossed and entranced.  I forced myself to slow down and just chip at reading it, rather than waste the fun in a binge.  The extensive footnotes and endnotes MUST be followed - critical narrative info is there and the diversion and distraction are part of the point.  The skewering of modern marketing trends, especially corporate purchase of \\"naming rights\\" for events and venues, is note-perfect.  The core characters are as complex and inconsistent as those found in real life.  I'd put this work right up there with Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\"; in fact the works of Wallace and Pynchon are side-by-side on my bookshelves.
B00328G4V6|5.0|Just as you thought they couldn't release any more material from the late Jimi Hendrix, this record comes out. It sounds a lot like the compilations I used to make of Jimi Hendrix bootlegs for the car back in the 1990's ! But still, you can hear the genius of Jimi writing and composing in studio, while jamming with his buddies. These songs aren't completely finished, but sound real good hear, and there are some new Hendrix sounds to think about here ! 5 stars !
030746363X|3.0|I like and admire the writing that Tim Ferriss has done, his blog, The 4 Hour Work Week, and his writing on other sites. I was looking forward to reading this book, so much so that I attempted to get a pre-release copy. I was unsuccessful, but the day it was released I read it cover to cover. The information in the book is good, no doubt. The diets, muscle building advice, sex tips, and many more are all top notch. I can see this book helping me for years to come in my physical pursuits.   The problem is the terrible organization of the book. It seems as if every page has 10 different footnotes, followed by pages of sidebars, adding to, subtracting from, and qualifying everything written. The footnotes and sidebars could have been highly helpful, yet the way they are presented is confusing and gives the impression the book was thrown together without thought for readability. I found myself going back and forth through over 500 pages trying to find even basic information. The information is 5 stars. The organization and the presentation are, at most, 2 stars.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I rushed and bought this through Amazon when I realized that it was no longer available directly (it came from one of their associated sellers).  The reason I mention this is because this usually indicates that something may be disappearing.  My guess is that if you want to add Eraserhead to your collection, do so now.  As to the movie itself, there is sufficient textual analysis without me adding much beyond the simple warning that this is NOT a horror movie, and where some of the reviewers here got that idea is beyond me.  There were some disgusting moments, particularly when Mary is having the little... whatever they are... in the bed.  That was tough.  However, I had forgotten, after several years without having seen the movie, how laugh out loud funny it is!  Is there a story, yes of course.  Is there a deeper text, I believe there is.  My own take, if anyone is interested, is that this is the most glaring indictment that I have ever seen of the chain of domesticity killing art, which leads to death.  Maybe a stretch, but it seems clear to me that Lynch was not excited by the idea of parenthood!  Anyway, the remastering is beautiful.  I also encourage you to get this for the Lynch interview that is included here.  Between this extended discourse, his commentary from Twin Peaks, and his discussions from Inland Empire, it is clear to me that this guy is one of the towering artists of the latter half of the twentieth, first decades of the 21st century.  And from all I can gather, people who have worked with him love him.  You don't want to let this one slip away.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|The three disk set was more than I expected.  Two separate versions of the film, great behind-the-scenes footage, and deleted scenes.  I particularly enjoyed watching them create the Navi.  Very well done.  Not expensive and worth the price.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|From start to finish, this was non-stop, balls to the wall action thriller.  I would have preferred that it be longer with more exposition and more character development which would have really made it an excellent film but it was a tremendously enjoyable one nevertheless.

B00003CXAA|1.0|Received this shipment from Shenzhen, China!  This is not a licensed, authentic release.  There isn't a proper bar code on the playside, nor a proper 6 digit serial number.  It doesn't have the necessary FBI warning at the beginning of the discs.  It was not appropriately sealed with the proper white security tape.  It is clearly a bootleg copy and the video quality bears this out.  The onscreen graphics were crude further indicating bootlegging.
B000003TBP|4.0|Open this album up. Take out the booklet. Notice how odd the art is.

This weird album gives you extraordinary lyrics. At times, you'll hear rhythms that sound better before the proceeding record plays. Mainly, this album would remind you of Hip-Hop.<br /><br />Relative tracks that caught my ears pleasantly were the laid-back \\"Lord Only Knows,\\" the Punk \\"The New Pollution,\\" the dizzying \\"Direlect,\\" \\"Novacane,\\" the peaceful \\"Jack-ass,\\" the somewhat club-sounding \\"Where It's At,\\" the rocker \\"Minus,\\" \\"Sissyneck,\\" and the slowest song on this record, \\"Ramshackle.\\"<br /><br />If you have an open-mind and could tolerate eclectic rhythms, then you'll enjoy this album.
B00192IV9U|4.0|I luv it. Just to hear what sounds like MJ to me is just fine by me. I'm a big fan and glad to hear Behind the Mask over and over (definitely MJ singing this one). It reminds me of the bad era when MJ ruled. It reminds me of the Michael we all fell in love with. I luv it.

B00005JLWN|5.0|2002's release of \\"Equilibrium\\" stars Dominic Purcell, Christian Bale, Sean Pertwee, and the lovely Emily Watson.  It is about a future existence where the sense of feeling has been not only outlawed and banned, there is a drug to sedate and subdue it that is required by law at a daily dose level to maintain the sanctity of having no feelings about anything whatsoever for any reason.<br />What makes this movie powerful is the onslaught of political correctness in society, and the forced adherence to \\"diversity\\" being a coerced requirement for continued employment at most workplaces, as well as getting right down to harassment policies where even an overly stern or \\"mean\\" stare is considered grounds for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal; because no one should have to endure a hostile work environment or feel emotionally uncomfortable by peers and especially not by superiors.  The boot camp experience for military inductees for the first time in history now equips the raw buck private rank newcomer with \\"timeout\\" cards so they can get distance between themselves and a drill sergeant they perceive is being too aggressive.  These are happening NOW here in America, not in some fantasy film about the future.<br />So getting back to the movie, we see an enforcer (called a Priest) who exacts his duties with weapons and martial arts skills.  There are no penalties for deadly force when arresting those who have chosen not to take the government's required drug to avoid having feelings.  Any item of sentimental value or object causing feelings or arousal of the senses in any definition, are to be destroyed immediately or turned into the repository back at headquarters for evidence so the guilty parties of human beings can be cremated alive.<br />This film flat out rocks.  If you have any concept at all about government censure of the true nature of human experience beyond the more obvious stuff like strong indications the perpetrator has lost their moral compass, then you realize the magnitude and relevance of this film.  If you exercise self-restraint far, far beyond what you want to so you can keep your job, or your fellowship elsewhere, then this movie \\"Equilibrium\\" resounds into the marrow of your bones.<br />The John Preston character portrayed by Christian Bale is one of the best Sci-Fi / Fantasy roles ever brought to the screen.  There is no way Keanu Reeves could have pulled this role off as well.  No way.<br />This movie is said to be a primer for the \\"Matrix\\" series of films.  I just call it one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  If this movie was on the floor I'd roll all around on it like a dog trying to get the scent of a fresh kill on themselves.  This movie knocks all the others like it stone cold dead.<br />Favorite scenes?  The last 20 minutes of this film.  Oh yeah.  5 stars.realize the magnitude and relevance of this film.

B000JJSPXQ|3.0|Okay. So we have Roxette's collection of their greatest hits. Don't expect these \\"hits\\" all to hit you in a good way.<br /><br />The noteworthy tracks off this CD were \\"One Wish,\\" the sunny \\"The Look,\\" the optimistic \\"Dressed for Success,\\" the upbeat \\"Dangerous,\\" \\"It Must Have Been Love,\\" the driving \\"Joyride,\\" and \\"Spending my Time with You.\\" Others I didn't care so much about. 7/20 of the album!<br /><br />I don't know much about this duo. I chose them out of a music catalog because I heard one of their songs before. That's just how I felt about the majority of this music: bored and impatient. I didn't like most of the rhythms.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This is one of those movies where you can sit back, relax, munch Cheese Doodles and sip a Coke/Pepsi. Not too deep of a storyline, but \\"Kick-Ass\\" makes up in the sheer craziness and pure, unadulterated superhero fun. Loved Nicholas Cage's outfit (and the choppy dialogue 'in suit' - Christian Bale, anyone?). Anyways, great movie to rent to watch over the weekend. (And the Marvel/DC/Dark Horse comic nods were awesome, by the way.)<br /><br />Parents, this has a lot of cursing, so you might want to think twice before having Junior watch it with you. Lots of violence, shooting, and blood, so again, be careful.
B002ZG99QS|2.0|Is it wrong of me to prefer logic over spectacle? Did I miss the point when I left \\"Tron: Legacy\\" feeling it was a monumental failure as a story? If I'm to continue with this review, I must first make it clear that I don't see the \\"Tron\\" films in the same way a lot of people do. I don't believe they deserve praise simply for their innovative special effects; I personally require an engaging plot, character development, and the sense that it's operating under a heightened but nonetheless understandable set of rules. In other words, I like a good sci-fi/fantasy film, but not when all effort is put into visuals and absolutely nothing is put into the screenplay. If that makes me a prude who wouldn't know a cool movie even if it came up and bit me, feel free to stop reading and start searching the web for a more enthusiastic review.    Just like its 1982 predecessor, watching \\"Tron: Legacy\\" is a little like watching a demo reel from the visual effects department - all flash and bang but no substance. It makes not the slightest effort to be plausible or consistent, it freely glosses over glaring technicalities, the dialogue is unbelievably awkward, and the performances are wasted on characters with no depth. The plot is convoluted and impenetrable, and it seems the more it tries to explain, the less sense it makes. The entire concept of people living inside a computer is a logistical nightmare, but if I start rattling off a list, I fear I might not be able to stop. Its greatest offense is not having any audience in mind other than the original film's fan base, which, when you think about, hardly seems big enough to have warranted a sequel in the first place.    I will admit that the film is a dazzling sight to behold. I was especially impressed with work done on the character of Clu, a hacking program; he was designed to look exactly like his creator, Kevin Flynn, but since people age and computer programs do not, it was necessary to digitally reconstruct the face of JeffBridges as it appeared over twenty years ago. The results are uncannily convincing. With just a little more development, we may someday see digital recreations of bygone Hollywood icons and not notice a difference. Imagine it - Humphrey Bogart acting alongside Ingrid Bergman in a sequel to \\"Casablanca.\\"    Since the events of the first film, Flynn got married, had a son, became a widower, and was promoted to CEO of a computer corporation called ENCOM International. He disappeared in 1989, leaving behind his son, Sam, and vague promises of a cutting edge digital revolution, one he claimed would forever change science, medicine, and religion. The story begins twenty years later, when a now twenty-seven-year-old Sam (Garrett Hedlund) breaks into ENCOM headquarters, distributes their newest operating system over the internet for free, uploads a virus into their mainframe, and escapes by jumping off the rooftop and releasing a parachute he just happened to have stowed away on his person. After his arrest and release, Sam is approached by ENCOM's consultant and Flynn's old friend Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), who says he received a page from Flynn's office, the number of which has been disconnected for twenty years. So help me God, the man is still using a pager.    Upon entering his father's abandoned arcade, Sam discovers a secret room with a miraculously functional computer and a fully operational laser; with a few careless strokes of the keyboard, Sam is zapped with light and transported into the computer world, known as the Grid. We then witness must have been an homage to the sepia-tone-to-Technicolor transition shown in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"; the film shifts from 2D to 3D, which is a new one on me. Sam is immediately captured by electronically-voiced guards in black suits with glowing orange stripes. After being stripped of his earthly clothes, fitted with a black suit with glowing blue stripes, and linked with a memory-storing disc that doubles as a Frisbee, he'spitted against Flynn's program, Clu (Jeff Bridges), who has since turned evil. He's then forced to participate in games of survival, including a race on digital motorcycles that trail light behind them. He's rescued by a program named Quorra (Olivia Wilde) and driven away from the city into the surrounding mountains. Mountains. In a computer grid. And there are clouds in the sky, too.    I will now stop describing the plot and move on to some of the little things that drove me mad. There's a house stocked with furniture, physical paper books, and food. I must assume it's not some digital replication, for Sam is able to eat it without a problem. There's a club high atop a sky rise in the heart of the computer city, where a program played by Michael Sheen struts around with a cane and speaks like a Dr. Frank N. Furter wannabe. There's an ending which begs the question of how anything created in a computer could ever exist in the physical human world. After all, it's all just a bunch of immaterial zeros and ones. The fact that I'm fixated on this when I'm supposed to be enjoying myself should tell you everything you need to know. \\"Tron: Legacy\\" is a horrendous miscalculation, one of the least understandable films to come along in quite some time.

B0040JHXTS|5.0|Not usually one to buy box sets due to they are usually just a re-hash or a bunch of songs found in a closet somewhere and the artist needs some quick cash. NOT HERE. This set is unbelievable. The songs on The Promise cd's are some of the best Springsteen has ever done. You can almost hear the youthful exhuberence the band had back then. The dvd of them playing Darkness live from Asbury Park is astonishing. It shows, with full clarity, why E- Street is the best American rock band in history. The dvd's from the shows in 1978 are amazing. Actually brings back what concerts were like back then. Remember how they turned the stage lights out after every song??? This is a must for any Springsteen fan. And for those on the sidelines, go out and buy this set. You'll finally understand what all of us have known for 35 years. Springsteen has no equal.
0812979656|4.0|I am a bit perplexed over R. Kamath's poor review of this book. I thought it was a valuable addition to the small but growing number of books about the great inequalities were dealing with in some places on this earth. Mr. Klamath, I suggest if everyone else is on the right foot when you are on the left, perhaps it is time to look within.
B00192IV0O|5.0|I waited and waited and waited to buy this CD and actually I didn't even buy it, my husband did.  I love love love \\"Meet Me Halfway\\", but dislike the other singles from the CD.  I have to say though that as a CD overall I love the vibe and energy of the music.  Whenever I need a pick-me-up I just listen to this CD and \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" I am in a good mood.  I love how they evolved from rap to EDM.  This is really good EDM as well and Fergie's voice is amazing on this CD!  I have all of their CD's, and this one is by far my favorite. Electronic Dance Music and Rap are my favorite genres, so if you dislike dance music, electronic music, or anything with an up-beat danceable beat then this one isn't for you.  If you want to dance around your house for an instant pick-me-up then this is the best to get the job done.
0743233832|5.0|Diminish outside forces that perturb the mind and soul! Aurelius's stoic philosophy is indeed a wise one but with this translation it is even more encompassing. It is only the will in a human that can be judged and controlled, everything else is beyond and should not effect emotions. To think that the Meditations were not even meant for anyone beside the Roman ruler himself, this translation is simple yet to the point without any embellishments, just the way Aurelius would have liked.
0891419063|4.0|\\"My subject is War, and the pity of War.  The Poetry is in the pity.\\"<br />  Wilfred Owen (1893-1918)<br /><br />Despite being a veteran of the victorious Allied powers, Sledge does not tell a story celebrating the triumph and heroism of the American Marines over the defeated Japanese soldiers.  The dominant theme running through the narrative is one of brutality and survival rather than heroism.  This comes as no surprise given the hellish conditions and terrible odds that the Marines in the Pacific campaigns face in surviving the battles.  The combat veterans reckon that they are unlikely to survive three campaigns and statistically, the odds of Sledge emerging alive from his two campaigns are close to 1 in 10.  It is nothing short of a miracle that he sees the end of the war physically unscathed and is in the company of the rare few in his unit who are not awarded the Purple Heart for injuries sustained in battle.<br /><br />Unlike the HBO's mini-series The Pacific, which draws on Sledge's memoir as one of the sources, the account does not highlight the heroism of soldiers at war.  The narrative focuses instead on vivid details of the sheer physical, psychological and emotional torture that Sledge experiences and observes in his comrades-in-arms.  In both campaigns, he recreates the lurid details of the battlefield: the heat, cold, disease, death and stench of uncovered decomposing bodies littering the very grounds that they are entrenched in for days and weeks of battle.  The details are so vivid that the reader is not only able to visualise the scenes but also able to touch, smell and taste the putrefaction that comes with war.  However, the memoir is not just about the savagery visited on the soldiers, but also recounts the soldiers in acts of savagery.  Both the Marines and their enemies commit atrocious acts of barbarism: the former using their issued Kabar knives to extract the gold teeth from fallen Japanese soldiers (and the Japanese soldiers need not even be dead); the latter severing the genitals of dead Marines and stuffing it into the mouths of their decapitated heads.  Although not explicitly stated, it seems that the account recalls and revises the oft quoted adage \\"war brings out the best and the worst in people\\" to \\"war does not bring out the best in soldiers, it brings out the worst in them.\\"<br /><br />Sledge's memoir is reminiscent of the poetry of Wilfred Owen who famously prefaced his poems with a critique of war.  In fact, the sentiments expressed in prose resemble the lines of Owens's Dulce et Decorum est with the exception of the final verse. Owens' final line in the poem criticises patriotism as political propaganda, but Sledge is no politician and does not dwell on the politics of war.  He is a Marine and as a Marine he does not question the \\"whys\\" of war, but only carries out his duties with honour and to the best of his ability.  There is no doubt that Sledge is proud to be a Marine and has no love lost towards the Japanese soldiers whom he detests as savage enemies whom he would kill with little hesitation.  In fact, he firmly believes the duty he owes to his country as a soldier, stating that \\"If a country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for.\\"  He does however criticise war and how it ravages the soldiers, both American and Japanese, who fight it.  His assessment of the two campaigns, indeed towards all wars, is aptly captured in his own words \\"War is brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste.\\"  Therein lies the existential conundrum that permeates his account: It is right to fight for the country although war (or the fight) is in itself wrong.ead); the latter severing the genitals of dead Marines and stuffing it into the mouths of their decapitated heads.

0061730335|5.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, a memoir by William Kamkwamba, is unique story about a boy who was inspired to make his life, as well as the lives of those around him, better.  William's story is unique because he is unique.  He was the only person in his village to decide the status quo was not good enough and to desire progress.  William went beyond being determined and motivated and actually created something nobody believed he could, thus exemplifying what humankind is capable of when they put themselves to the task.      Ideas, because of their abstract form, are one of the few things that are beneficially contagious and have the ability to move freely throughout the world via education and opportunity.  In addition, with the help of a global language, they have become cross-cultural and are shared across geographical boundaries.  Education is the most important method of stimulating progress and raising the standard of living throughout the globe.  When people from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds interact, they have the ability to enrich one another with different ideas, values, and lifestyles.  Every language and every culture admires and respects universal concepts such as justice, truth, liberty, tolerance, and integrity.   The human condition revolves around both joy and suffering, and we have a basic understanding of, and empathy for, both which allows us to celebrate both our differences and the attributes that make us akin.  Through interaction we can share the lust for learning and the ability to grow together as a community.  This is William's message to everyone and it is our job to listen.

It's not that it gets boring, it's just difficult to follow the where and why (and not unintentionally, because the main character is a bit lost in the puzzle himself) until you see the end.     Ben Foster was great. I think this is a breakthrough movie for him. I've always thought he was goog enough, but Pandorum makes me hope he does more movies like this.    Easily one of my all time favorite Sci-Fi flicks.
0316067938|1.0|Before there was a huge massive plethora of Twilight fans, there were the few people that read the first book and were enchanted by the \\"vegetarian\\" vampires and their beauty. In the fourth edition of the novel, all of that enchantment went somewhere quite far away. Gone were the sacrifices that Bella had to make for her \\"love\\" and gone were the clean old days of no \\"imprinting.\\" But what is the most unappealing is the slow downgrade of Meyer's writing style. There was no romantic moment of when Edward would finally turn her into a vampire so they could be forever together, but in fact it was Edward turning her into a vampire while she was covered in blood , a couple of ribs were broken, and  a baby was just born. In the fourth installment of the book, there are practically no romantic scenes with Bella and Edward after she turns into a vampire, they just do it all the time. When the baby is born and she is finally a vampire, her power is great self- control which is rather undesirable in a vampire if you ask all of the vampire writers ever created. A self-controlled vampire is just like a pretty human who goes hunting a lot, and what is the point of that? Not to mention Jacob \\"imprinting\\" on her daughter and everyone eventually being fine with it, that he only ever met Bella so he could meet Renesmee. Interesting name by the way, very original. And I can't help but laugh when I imagine the final battle being everyone standing behind Bella while she puts her little barrier up and no one can do anything about it. I think i threw this book at the wall actually because I disdained it so.

030746363X|1.0|I was SO looking forward to this book that I even pre-ordered it and I almost never do that. But it has been a huge disappointment. 1 - did someone forget to tell Ferriss that his book would be sold outside of the Bay Area? The book is very \\"California\\" with references to local cities and vendors that not everyone will be able to understand. It adds an extra element of being self-serving and the book does not need any more help in that department. 2 - the majority of the info is already available in other sources, it's just presented from the first person view in the book. For example, in the weight loss chapter, I didn't learn anything new or anything that wouldn't already be available in something like \\"Sugar Busters\\". The info is presented in a new way but there's little else that's innovative about this book.
B00436GNVC|5.0|On this album Duffy presents tracks that evoke the sound of 60's and 70's pop, colored by her unique flavor. She co-wrote 9 of the 10 songs, and co-produced all 10, and the album provides an excellent setting to showcase her voice, which is very expressive, especially in the ballads. Many of the songs are backed by warm 60's-70's string arrangements and simple beats. Many of the melodic tunes are in minor keys, or else have frequent shifts between major and minor chords, pleasing to the ear and signaling a little seriousness in the unfolding of the story. The down-to-earth lyrics, both in content and in structure, are meant to be sung, rather than delivered in a conversational manner, as are so many of the lyrics in pop songs of today.<br /><br />&#34;My Boy&#34; is live, the only live track, and I can almost hear Diana Ross & The Supremes singing it. Likewise, &#34;Don't Forsake Me&#34; could have been a Dusty Springfield hit. &#34;Keeping My Baby&#34; and &#34;Girl&#34; (a very playful song) have busier string arrangements reminiscent of the ones in Donna Summer's early tracks. &#34;Breath Away&#34; has the same general &#34;feel&#34; as &#34;Be My Baby&#34;, the Ronettes classic. The final track &#34;Hard For The Heart&#34; is the most developed, bringing together most of the above-mentioned stylistic tools into one very moving and satisfying finish.<br /><br />The lineup is pretty evenly divided: half ballads, half uptempo numbers (pretty tame by today's standards). The production includes some current elements, due to which it manages to bridge the gap between eras and to transcend being totally &#34;retro&#34;. Overall, this is relaxed adult contemporary music. Not bombastic or groundbreaking, just enjoyable.<br />*******************************<br />Today, June 30, 2016, I am adding this appendage to the review I wrote in 2010.<br />I well remember the outrage of many who loved Duffy's first album &#34;Rockferry&#34;, and had a seemingly kneejerk loathing for this one. Listening to both of them now, I can see why. &#34;Rockferry&#34; holds up as a serious work, a work of art, if you will. It is truly excellent. &#34;Endlessly&#34; was obviously envisioned as a more commercial, pop effort. It backfired, because those who wanted more of &#34;Rockferry&#34; could not tolerate the transition. I completely understand that. I still like both albums, but I admit that &#34;Rockferry&#34; is superior.m now, I can see why. &#34;Rockferry&#34; holds up as a serious work, a work of art, if you will.

0765326353|4.0|this book has gotten very lonely in the middle. by lonely, i mean that it has become a struggle to continue reading. i hit a personal best of 14 pages in one sitting last night. my goal was to get to interlude two. if not for interlude two, i would never, NEVER had been able to read 14 pages in the middle of this book. i've read all of mr. sanderson's other works and found them enjoyable. this book started out great with assassinations, war and what-not...but then, for me, it just stopped around page 51 or so. i continued, however, all the way to interlude two (page 428 or something), and have now shelfed this book to start reading 'the lies of locke lamora' in an attempt to get my mojo back. i plan to trudge on through TWOK, but i have to read something else for now. maybe several somethings. perhaps i'll read another book at each interlude (however many there are left) and book 2 will be out when i'm finished. that could be nice. i think this series might be really good, but i just don't like the feeling that i'm putting in work to read a book.    **update** after taking a break at interlude 2 to read another book, i came back to TWoK...and was very impressed. The story really took off after the second interlude. i was able to read the last 550 pages in about 1/5 of the time it took to do the first 450. i can attribute some of the speed to my receiving a Kindle between sessions. I didnt feel like the reading was as daunting without the cinder-block-of-a-book sitting in my lap. Let's face it...that damned book was hard to carry around and find a comfortable position to read with. Mostly, the book really kicked into gear. the first half read like prologue...and that couldnt be avoided due to the nature of the beast. But it was SO slow. Mr Sanderson made up for this in the second half. I would give it 5 stars, except for the pacing in the beginning. thank you, jj.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is perhaps 2010's most astonishing film, designed on a big budget, the product of 10 years writing work,  a success at the box office. I'm not going to bother describing the story. Any short description wouldn't do justice to how well put together and nuanced the story is, any long discussion would spoil moments without need.    Suffice it to say, the themes of the movie (on my rendering, at least) are how humans influence each other, and an exploration of the hazy epistemic boundaries between dreams and experience. Leonardo Dicaprio has come a long way since Titanic.  Here, he's a true star in every sense of the word: he holds this multi-hundred-million dollar movie together through his emoting, and his struggles are who the audience follows throughout the movie.  Ironically, however, I found myself more drawn to the unknown-to-me Joeseph Gordon-Levitt, who is perhaps given the film's best role in the point man who has to navigate a dream where the rules of physics have gone completely awry. After Inception, I watched 500 days of Summer, and with the experience of both of these films in my mind, I declared Levitt my favorite actor recently. The stunts he pulls in Inception are quite simply amazing, and even the Blu-Ray's breakdown of how they were composed does nothing to fade my admiration. These two are pretty much headliners of a cast of incredibly talented people, including Michael Caine and the beautiful Marion Cotillard.     Behind the scenes, however, we always sense the hand of Christopher Nolan, whose themes existential anxiety continue from the Dark Knight and Memento. Some of the shots in this movie are second to none, and that is effort not owed to actors or setup crew, this is brilliance at the writing and production stage.  Even the first scene, of Leonardo Dicaprio lying on a beach, soaking wet as waves crash, is absolutely gorgeous. It's realistic, gritty, but at the same time, it's more gorgeous to me than anything seen in say, Avatar orThe Matrix. Delve deeper into the lore of the movie and you'll realize that musically it's brilliant too, the sound of Edith Piaf slowed down and altered into a leitmotif that sounds deep and imposing.    Such a collaboration of exceptional actors, filmmakers, and writers truly deserves to be seen.  If you enjoy it a quarter of how much I have, you're in for a pretty good ride.

0552999652|4.0|This is a very entertaining and engaging account of the (in)famous attempt by US soldiers to \\"arrest\\" two Somali warlords in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993.  The mission went terribly wrong and this account recreates, in vivid detail, the encounter from multiple perspectives.    Bowden has clearly thoroughly researched his subject and manages to write a coherent narrative despite the sometimes confused and manic manner in which the incident unfolded.  While clearly sympathetic to the US 'men on the ground' I think he is generally balanced and fair in his approach to all involved parties.    But most of all I just found this book so interesting it was hard to put down.  I'm now looking forward to reading other Bowden books in future.
B0046IGOIO|4.0|Though not on par with the Felt Forum and Aquarius shows, the two-hour \\"Live in Vancouver\\" (1970) remains a memorable Doors concert. The four-song set with blues legend Albert King is a definite highpoint, yet there are excellent versions of \\"Five to One,\\" \\"When the Music's Over\\" and the dynamic 17-minute \\"Light My Fire\\" (with a little \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\" thrown in for good measure). However, when Jim Morrison launches into \\"Petition The Lord With Prayer,\\" you wish his brief recital would have been followed by a live rendition of \\"The Soft Parade.\\" Decent sound quality for a nonprofessional recording.

This is one of those books where the less you know in advance, the more you will enjoy it.<br /><br />This book really has three parts; first, where we meet the main characters and slowly start to understand the unimaginable horror of what their situation is; second, the excruciatingly suspenseful part; and third, the aftermath. I found the book almost impossible to put down during the first two parts; the third part, while very sweet and moving, was not quite so compelling, but enormously satisfying.<br /><br />Good Kindle edition; no typos and very, very few spurious hyphenations.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that you will remember for a long time after reading it.
B0042AEOG0|1.0|Super disappointing, and seems like an afterthought to her first Christmas album. I love her music, especially her previous Christmas cd. But this is just bad. Someone took a lot of liberties in the production dept, all the added 'noise' in the background on most of these songs takes away from the reason we're all buying this cd - Mariah's great voice!! I love new takes on old Christmas songs, and even more than that I love new Christmas songs that are relevant to today's tastes. But the 'new' songs or new versions of songs on this cd are truly awful. Beats that don't make sense. And if you're wondering what everyone's talking about as far as the talking or noise in the background mentioned in reviews, basically the CD as a whole is made to feel/sound like it was recorded at someone's holiday party, loads of dubbed in noise of fake glasses clinking, fake conversational noise etc ... and worse than that you'll hear a crowd of people yelling in the background \\"Oh yeah,\\" or just shouting out random things, at the beginnings and endings of or even during every song, as if they were in the room during the recording. Whereas her first Christmas cd was all glossy pop fun, this one is just scratchy on the ears. Don't waste your cash. Buy her first one, or spring for the Glee album, or Straight no Chaser if you're looking for something new.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Sigh No More is an excellent debut album by Mumford & Sons.  It contains their catchiest singles, like \\"Little Lion Man,\\" \\"Winter Winds,\\" and \\"The Cave,\\" but it's on less popular (read: less featured) songs like \\"Dust Bowl Dance\\" that their soul really shines through.  Mumford is an excellent leader who provides a consistent vision, but at times it feels almost too consistent.  There are enough risks to keep the album interesting on every track, though, and most pay off wonderfully.  Excellent first listen, high replayability.

B003EYVXYQ|3.0|This is the weakest of the dead series by far, It's got Romeros humor though and lots of gunfire , but the cgi is budget cgi even and that doesn't help, it looks like a scy fy produced saturday night flick. Some of which are pretty good and some are bad in the effects arena. (by todays standards not tenyears ago, I can't stand people who complain about the effects of a older movie. that's completely lame).  One thing that's different here is that for some reason several characters are concerned about millions of dollars. In a disaster world paper money is only good for wiping ones butt, silver and gold retain some value only if there's enough to eat though. Anyways the acting is fine here but the money is gone for poor george who must make do with what he has effects wise.  This is not a one star movie though, it is Romero and although I like bigger stories than this like \\"dawn of the dead' which is a classic or the original 'night of the living dead' alot better this story about fueding families on a island still has some resonance. Although in a zombie world you'd have lots of supplies all over the place so I can't see people always gunning for each other. Every living person is someone who can take out a zombie after all.<br />This looks best on blu ray and it has extras but no deleted scenes. I have all the dead series on blu ray including the other variant strains so I had to have this one. It's not great but it's worth seeing and not going rabid on as a terrible movie , it's a very low budget movie for sure. But the story is good enough to entertain zombie fans.
B0049P0A0W|5.0|A friend sent me a link to Skrillex - Kill Everybody in the World and I almost had a heart attack.    Every song I've heard off this album has production second to none.  His kicks are hard, tight, and boomy all at the same time.  The aggression is high, but you absolutely can not stop bobbing your head even when you're not in the mood to listen to dubstep/house whatever this is.    The melodies are catchy like Daft Punk wishes theirs still were.  Just listen to the the vocal sample in Rock N' Roll, the heavily chopped melody in Kill Everybody that makes you wonder how your brain can connect the melody between the constant chopping interruptions (it's like a mindgame), and the title track with the stacking cup girl sample mixed with the beautiful warm synth lead, is just so much fun.  [...] for the sample source.     I like how the whole album feels connected.  There is a dark current underneath the entire thing which is very rare in this style of music.  Most albums I hear where I like one song; the album ends up with every song sounding the same and boring or it's all completely disconnected and unharmonious.  This feels focused like the Joshua Tree or Pretty Hate Machine    I'm guessing Deadmau5 had a hand in this, but can't say for sure.  All I can say is Skrillex has my attention and I would not be surprised if he pulled dubstep out of the shadows.

The themes revisit \\"Bladerunner\\" and \\"Oryx and Crake\\" (and many others I suppose, but those were the two that stuck out to me), but in an original and (just slightly) more optimistic way.  The complexity of the motives of each character was wonderful in its reality, and I constantly found myself trying to decide if I wanted them to succeed for fail.  They were sympathetic and repugnant in the way most real people are.  The beginning is a bit slow as the world is built, but the tensions build and the book moves quickly toward the end.

I will not elude any more to the movie as not to give anything away; however, I think that Polar Express will soon become a Christmas tradition in viewing for \\"children\\" of all ages.  Enjoy!

B003EI2EH2|2.0|Poorly written, sensationalized content that will appeal to the cult of personality that Mr. Ferris has very successfully created.    Most of the information on diet is covered if far greater detail in *many* other books with far more legitimate authors.    The sections on better sex are almost sexist.  My wife read and friends read those sections and commented that if someone made love to them like with the technical approach Mr. Ferris describes, they would laugh him out of bed.    The sections are working out, at the techniques, are good, albeit short--hence the two-star rating.    Chapters are disjointed and the constant references to the web annoying.    Constant contradictions throughout the book too make for a read that is simply annoying.      Ugh.

B0045JEPXK|2.0|I am honestly the biggest Leona fan ever because i know the quality she can produce.The only reason why i gave the concert a 2 Star is because it was beautifully designed with dancing ,the set up and the back up singers.Im really disappointed and sad its like Leona only trained to move and dance the singing was far from good.The worst is when she sang at the olymplics,Ellen, Oprah and other live venues she was incredible but in this concert she sang breathlessly with very bad technique. The band was way to loud and definitely didnt help her either. The reason i love Leona is because she sings such incredibly deep and ballad like music but someone decided to turn some of the songs into up beat songs , that man should be fired.She didnt even sing my favourite songs MY HANDS AND I WILL BE.Another reason i love Leona is because she was nothing like Mariah Carey but now she almost sings exactly like her which is horrible!!WHERE'S MY REAL LEONA!!!
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is an excellent movie that you have to see more than once to fully understand it. I have seen it 3 times so far and still have questions, but I learn something new with each view, which is something I find exciting in movies where you learn something new each time you view it. This movie may even make you question reality, like it did with me when I first saw it. If you enjoy movies that make you think for days after viewing it then this is the movie for you.
B000VBIGD6|3.0|I had the DVD of Christmas Vacation and decided to purchase the blu ray.  Although I don't regret the purchase, I don't notice much of a difference from the upscaled DVD through the Blue Ray Player.  Great movie, but the 3 stars vs higher reflects the fact I was not impressed with the upgrade.  To be fair, it could be the age of the movie and my expectations could have been too high.  Picture is decent...  If you are purchasing for the first time, the blu ray makes sense.  However, think twice before replacing the DVD you already have.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|DEAR MARKUS ZUSAK...should you ever find this.  We read together last year at a book festival in Maui but I  had not yet finished reading THE BOOK THIEF.  Once I finished,  I had to read it  again.  Its a stunning creation,  and not just a book for young adults.  Readers of all ages will be overwhelmed by the sheer beauty and sensitivity of the writing.  It is a  tale  about adults,  about hatred and war and resurrection, from a child's point of view.  It is about the awakening mind,  and how fragile such a thing can be.  It is about love of books,  and  of imagining,  and how the simplest reverie can set the  mind free.<br /><br />The BOOK THIEF  is a tale of course  about  the  death of the heart and the struggle to hold on to one's humanity.  The narrator is someone  historically shunned and  feared,  but in the end he is transformed into something almost human,  deserving  of compassion in his  world-weariness.  It takes superlative  writing  to make readers sympathetic to  Death  who finally succumbs to  defeat in the face of  mass-genocide  and  war.  The  novel  is  brilliant  in its concept and in the  writing.  A book for all ages.  Extraordinary.<br />  - Kiana Davenport, author of HOUSE OF SKIN PRIZE-WINNING STORIES  (Kindle)
B00436GNVC|2.0|Dear Duffy, I recall almost three years ago listening to samples from Rockferry and being very much impressed with what I heard, I proceeded to purchase the CD. Giving it a few listens was like real music coming back again compare what is going on in commercial music today. Along with a hand full of other artist who have ignored the current trends and just going back to making music the old fashion way with good lyrics, skillful musicians actually playing instruments, melodies that stay in your head long after the music stops playing and a vocalist who sang with a passion and had a certain uniqueness in the voice, Rockferry was like the great music of yester year done in a modern fashion. In some aspects, the songs from Rockferry felt like songs that were broadcast on the radio back in the 60s but somehow that got stuck in the upper atmosphere then suddenly release and now making their way to our radios. Best of all a new artist was emerging who was compared to other great singers of the past and to have a lot of class compare to the freak show that today's pop tart put on these days.     Now it is 2010 fall and you have released your follow up to Rockferry called Endlessly. I saw you perform the title song on the Jools Holland show and I was blown away. Well, Well, Well was a serviceable follow up to Mercy then I thought Ok, off to a good start. Then I started to read some of the early review of the CD and heard sample. That is when I went into oh no phase. You wanted to branch out, change producers and such but what has happened is that you did not take into consideration of why your fans liked Rocferry in proceeding with a follow-up. You lead the followers of Rockferry south then all suddenly we are being lead north. You're taking in too many commercial considerations on your multiplatinum follow up. Duffy, the buyers of Rockferry liked the fact that that CD did not follow the current trends. I think a lot of your fans will be very disappointed with this follow-up as already seen by the three star reviews, not moving up the amazion.com sales chart and having a very bad billboard preview. Even worse is there are two Madonna retreads on this record, a rewrite of Poppa Don't Preach in Keeping My Baby and Like A Virgin in Girl. Some reviewer have gave positive remarks to the song Too Hurt To Dance but this just sound like a rehash of a lot of slow heart break ballads of the late 1950s/60s.     In conclusion, Rockferry was a record that I recommended to a lot of people and received positive feedback. In fact there was a lady I saw in a store checking out Rockferry CD, I walked over to her and let her listen to some samples I had on my IPOD. Needless to say she left the store with the CD. I would be embarrassed to recommend Endlessly to anyone. I might just end buying a few songs on line from the CD and just hope for the best next time. Duffy, please change course to where you were with Rockferry, while we did not want you to make a Rockferry II but to gradually move in new directions instead of a sudden shift to a place where your fans don't want to go so quickly. The girls on the cover of Rockferry who appeared broken hearted at the train station were handing out music of substance. The pretty girl on the cover of Endlessly by way of cheesy arrangements and lackluster material is handing out cotton candy. I hope her career can survive this.       I wilcome comments from people on my review.
B00192IV9U|5.0|Very good releases of Michael's work he would give it thumbs up and so would I. Ever since 'I Want You Back' was release, I was a fan who  grew up with the Jackson 5 Era. An excellent CD.  Get it for yourself, if you are a true fan dont listen to the negative.  Take it from someone who has been there from the beginning.  You wont be disappointed. It is Michael who is singing those parts!!!!

B001PB3RU8|5.0|There is such a shortage of true artists in the modern music world. I bought the album after hearing \\"Dog days are over\\" and after hearing the entire album I have to say the songs mesh with the same quality, and eccentricity. She's the real deal, not a poseur publicity hog (yeah Lady GaGa, I'm talkin' about you!)
B000000OQY|5.0|Like I said in title, if Appetite For Destruction would add a bonus CD, adding songs that were possible to be on Appetite For Destruction, these songs would be on that CD. Even though I said \\"Just some....\\" doesn't mean it is not good, actually, I find it's better than the Use Your Illusion Albums. Just for your information, Rose stated that he didn't like how he sounded on the album because his voice sounded rough around the edges (for example, the album has the song \\"Move to the City\\" which Rose's voice sounds like on \\"You Could Be Mine\\" from Use Your Illusion II).        The first half of the album (The A-Side of the album if using cassette tape or Vinyl) is live, while the other half (or B-Side) is acoustic. The first track on the album is a song called \\"Reckless Life\\" which believe it or not, was the first song written by the band, being written around 1979-1981. The song starts out with an explicit shout out, but the rest of the song is not explicit. The second track is \\"Nice Boys\\", a cover that was originally by Rose Tattoo. The third track is \\"Move to the City\\", with Rose saying an explicit line a few times. The fourth track is \\"Mama Kin\\" a song originally by Aerosmith. The fifth track is an acoustic love song, called \\"Patience\\". It has some of the most beautiful lyrics I ever heard. The sixth track is a song called \\"Used To Love Her\\". The song is a joke about Rose's dog (stating, \\"I used to Love her, but I had to kill her. I knew I'd miss her, now she's buried right in my backyard). The seventh track \\"You're Crazy\\" (originally known from Appetite For Destruction in it's faster form) is acoustic, even though it was performed with electric guitars on Appetite For Destruction, it was originally attended to be an acoustic song, like it is on here. The eighth and last track on the album is \\"One in a Million\\", a one of many songs that shows how talented Axl Rose is at writing songs. It is a very beautiful song and a very offensive song at the same time. My favorite thing about this song is that, at the end, Rose states how he is not perfect, and telling people they should accept themselves for who they are, that everyone is perfect in their own way (the lyrics, \\"You're One in a Million, that's what you are. You're One in a Million babe, you're a shooting star. Maybe someday we'll see you, before you make us cry. You know we tried to reach you, but you were much too high.\\" and \\"Some say I'm lazy, some say that's just me. Some may think I'm crazy, I guess I'll always be\\"). A great album, and I recommend for you to buy it.
030746363X|4.0|The huge amount of unique and interesting material in this book will make it worth the price for most people. However, how much you gain from this book will depend largely on how much you trust Tim Ferriss.<br />With the exception of the slow-carb diet, Tim tested everything on either just himself or one or two other \\"test subjects\\", so there might be a lot of other variables involved with his incredible results. It's up to the reader to find out if what worked for Tim works for them.<br /><br />I've tried his diet plan before (when he first posted it on his blog)and I found that while it works for me, it definitely doesn't work any miracles. Tim's diet and exercise philosophies seem similar to Harvey Pasternak's 5-Factor books (personally I like the 5 Factor method because it's easier to stick to long-term).<br /><br />The chapter I found most interesting was the 15 minute orgasm chapter. As a female, I agree with Tim that the key to the orgasm is making the woman feel comfortable and not pressuring her to \\"perform\\". This may mean not making the orgasm session part of sex or even foreplay. You have to treat it as a experiment that may not lead to anything; you're just trying to find out what makes her feel good. Tim advocates letting the woman know that you are just going to tend to her for 15 timed minutes, not expecting any sex or even any moaning on her part. Between that and using your hand instead of your tongue, you'll be making her feel relaxed.<br /><br />The one thing that bothered me is that there are many inconsistencies and areas where Tim might not be choosing to look at the whole picture. It that has been mentioned in other reviews is that Tim claims exposing yourself to cold (such as ice baths) can help you lose a lot of fat, but how does that explain the fact that that swimmers don't have the leanest bodies compared to other types of athletes? Also, he advertises that on your cheat day you can eat whatever you want in unlimited quantities (candy bars are highly encouraged!), but then goes into great detail about what he has to do to combat the calories ingested on his cheat day. His cheat day regiment includes special workouts right before the meals, food timing, pills, only cheating after a healthy breakfast meal...the rules are much more complex than Tim advertises. Turns out it IS a lot of work to get a 4 hour body!but then goes into great detail about what he has to do to combat the calories ingested on his cheat day.

B002ZG994U|5.0|Fantastic movie!  Loved it in the theater and bought it on the first day it was released on DVD.  I really hate the manipulation of the public toward buying the new technology.  There is nothing wrong at all with sregular DVD players, but the makers of the DVDs are really guiding people toward the BluRay players.  The lack of the extras on the regular DVD sucks.  Why should people not be able to see extras just because they can not afford or have been waiting to buy a bluray machine.
0061730335|5.0|In the book, The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, the main character, William Kamkwamba, epitomized a motivated student.  Not only did he want a formal education, he sought out learning experiences on his own.  His natural curiosity was uncanny.  When he was young, he and his friends would build toy cars out of plastic bottles and other types of \\"trash\\".  He was quite ingenious at a young age and his friends were supportive of this.  They always tried new things.  They wondered how things worked.  They took apart radios to see how they worked.  Because of this, they learned about electric current.  Radio repair work became a side job, and people were surprised that such young people could do such a good job.  There was a natural curiosity to how things worked.  Later, he used \\"trash\\" again, to build a windmill that gave his family lights. William's natural curiosity represents the curiosity of all children.  Children definitely want to learn about things around them.  William was implanted with a dream, by just seeing and reading about a simple machine--a windmill.  He saw this as a way to deal with problems with life in Malawi--lack of necessities, such as food, easy access to clean water, and even clean lights at night. William's good fortune of having many people who supported him, including his father, also made him successful.             Not only could he be an inspiration to teachers, he is a definitely inspiration to students and his own countrymen. William's experiences show that with just a little support, an education, and a lot of curiosity anything is possible.  I believe that William will help make his village and country a better place to live.
1439181780|5.0|This is one awesome book, and CD set is great too.  Perfect follow on to \\"The Secret\\" also by Rhonda Byrne.  Well written, easy to read and apply.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know.
B001KOFH2G|3.0|In this review I discuss not the movie, but this product offering.  The movie rocks; goes without saying.<br /><br />But I buy BluRay for significantly better picture.  This is only marginal quality.  Imo the DVD is nearly as good.  Since I had the Collector's edition already, I find little value in this offering.  If you don't already own the Collector's edition, sure, get this BluRay. If you do, you may wind up considering this a waste of money.  The quality just isn't that impressive.<br /><br />That said, I was pleased to find this is the Collectors edition (which I'd wondered about).  It comes with some nice additional features... IF your BluRay machine can handle it.  If your machine is older than a year as of this writing, you probably won't be able to use the fancies that come with the BluRay edition (such as the ship blueprints, which require PIP capability).<br /><br />So only giving this three stars. This doesn't even come close to the significant improvement of the BluRay version of AVATAR (the BluRay version of AVATAR is definitely worth the upgrade).  In Serenity, I think the transference quality could have been sharper, better, more defined.<br /><br />So movie, 5 stars, BluRay quality 3 stars (if that).
B001OQCV6A|3.0|As some reviewers have noted, this Sherlock Holmes is more faithful to Conan Doyle's original.  Fair enough, but it is shot in a style that is more appropriate for video game players than traditional viewers and readers.  The genre is action/adventure cum crime and detective fiction and the dialogue (as in the Benedict Cumberbatch Holmes) is delivered with breathless rapidity.  Many will cry out for subtitles, but by the time you would have been able to read them the camera would have moved on to the next scene (or scenes).  Ritchie's film is visually stunning at many points.  I don't mind the CGI; the image of the city with Tower Bridge under construction is fantastic.  The atmospherics are superb.  However, the soundtrack may be one of the most annoying and grating ever created.<br /><br />The story is vague, but Holmes explains it all at the end.  There is also a lot going on: an evil lord set out to beat the hangman and take over the world; plants, nostrums, diabolical devices, a love interest for Watson, a love interest/competing criminal for Holmes and, in the background, off camera, the looming Moriarty (with a little professorial chalk on his lapels--Ritchie doesn't lack a sense of humor).<br /><br />My advice to viewers: know what you're getting into; don't be disappointed.  The movie has some considerable strengths, but this is a film for the short-attention-span generation.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This sums up the mindset of the men featured in this incredible series.  This movie is similar to Band of Brothers only in that it portrays a theater of combat in World War 2. It's different in every other way. It follows not one unit, but three men.  And not just in combat, but at home before the war, during the war, and after the war.  It's actually not really about the war at all as it is about Eugene Sledge, John Basilone and Bob Leckie, and the many men like them who served our nation during this awful yet pivotal time in our history.      It's foul, it's graphic, it's depressing - and yet it's also inspiring, encouraging and uplifting.  It's extremely well shot and acted and, while it does graphically portray the horror of war, it doesn't focus on that single aspect of gore and bloodshed.  We see the non-combat suffering of these men and learn of the toll it takes upon the human spirit both during and after the war.     I think that perhaps the most profound and moving part of the series was the commentary of the men portrayed in the film that is on the final DVD. This is where the above quote originated.  They were ordinary boys before the war. They were dutiful Americans to enlist. During the war, their only focus was to keep themselves and their buddies alive. And after the war, they sought only to honor the sacrifices made by their fallen friends and make the most of their lives.     This is NOT Band of Brothers. It's different. And in many ways it's better. And in every way it is highly, highly recommended.
0545265355|3.0|I want to give prospective readers a fair warning about the content of these books. The content is extremely violent, graphic and disturbing.  Imagine a gladiator arena with teenagers as the gladiators, everything around you is made to kill you and only one teenager can come out alive.  If this was a movie, it would be easily rated \\"R\\" for violence.  I do have to admit that the author is a very talented writer and storyteller, and the books are hard to put down.  So, if you do not want to get sucked into a violent story, don't pick up the books.
1439177783|3.0|The majority of the book focuses on Portia's suffering from her intense eating disorder.  I found it very difficult to read because it was so depressing.  I had anorexia of a different kind when I was a young woman.  I couldn't understand how Portia could work out and run hard when she was so undernourished. I remember feeling really sick when I was that thin.  If I didn't know ahead of time that it all turned out ok, I couldn't have finished the book.  The hope and healing didn't show up until nearly the end.  Portia is a pretty good writer.  But I think the book became a bestseller more because of who she is than because of its content.  If I were to write about my own experience with an eating disorder, I would include more hopeful things throughout so my reader wouldn't give up out of depression.

0385341008|3.0|I found this story a bit too cute, a bit too obvious. There were too many kooky old aunt types.  It was roundly dissed by my book group.  I would not recommend it with so many really good books to read.
B002S0OBMS|2.0|Now that Webber has revised the book and score in response to poor reviews and box office, will they recut the cast recording?  Those who purchased the original version should get a free replacement if they do. It will be valued as a curiosity when this show finally bites the dust.     For those who care, the story revisions don't cure the fatal flaws of the book and will not likely change the opinions of critics or audiences.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|When I was fortunate to see the movie @ the theatre in 3D I was left breathless. For the very first time I felt like I was being told the story while being involved within the environnent itself. I did not want to come back.  When I got my opportunity @ this special dvd compilation the saddest moment was the fact I must watch it in 2D. But with the added minutes, giving more of an informative back story for Earth along with previous events on Pandora made for a knock it out of the ball park entertainment for myself. I am a true movie slut, but as far as my ultimate favorites it's a very small group & for any new movie to enter that list the Bible must have been re-written.  With this, AVATAR, it was. My #1 is Gigi, then we go into The Women ('39), The Best Years Of Our Lives, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Mildred Pierce, Mrs. Miniver, The Enchanted Cottage - some modern day one's are Grease, Vincent Price horror movies, Hamer horror films, any Hitchkock TV/Movie, even Julie & Julia. Now Avatar is in my definite \\"Love Those\\" & I could watch them over & over. The best part is when you've seen a movie so many times that you feel you know all there is to offer, & suddenly you are pleasantly surprised to find that how wrong you were. Admittedly, my top 5 Fav's are in the category of old classics - but This AVATAR version comes closer than anything I have seen in \\"Years\\"..  So- Go for it - Do Not let this movie (this version) not be a part of your movie library &/or to watch & enjoy list. If you look hard enough you'll see me there working on transforming so to live in an untouched amazingly beautiful world.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I am going to make this real brief, I am a fan of Zombie movies, but besides that, this is an excellent Show, it takes its time to develop the story in a manner that you can grasp compleatly the Characters, story line, etc. It's only 6 episodes but it has been such a good season I believe that season 2 is right behind it. This is a must have Tv show for Zombies fan and horror/drama lovers.
030745455X|3.0|After reading \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" I read the second book in the trilogy, \\"The Girl who Played with Fire,\\" because like so many others I found Lisbeth Salander, if not fully drawn in \\"Tattoo,\\" mysterious enough to follow her story further.  If I found the first thirty pages of \\"Tattoo\\" slow and the last two-hundred convoluted and repetitive, I nevertheless expected \\"Fire\\" to be intriguing because of the seemingly unique  personality of Salander.  After all, good fiction is driven by characterization, not plot.  However, the second book neither delivered a fascinating character in the person of Salander nor did it convey an interesting plot; instead it presented a convoluted storyline, a series of sensational themes and motifs, and a sociopathic perspective that not only was disappointing, but suggested an author who was a hack rather than a literary writer or even a moderately deft storyteller of \\"kitchen fiction.\\"  Make no mistake about it, \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" is pop fiction, not literary fiction and neither complex nor substantive in characterization, theme or plot.  It is crime fiction that seeks to titillate and amuse by simplistic and sensational devices.  Moreover, this book, unlike \\"Tattoo,\\" does not deliver in presenting a coherent plot, the first requirement of mainstream fiction.<br /><br />\\"Tattoo\\" had an interesting storyline of business espionage so that the serial killer theme did not completely overshadow what began as an interesting story and then lapsed into sensationalism and extraneous detail, shallow characterization and superfluous and incomplete secondary plots.  What remained intriguing throughout that book was the cipher Lisbeth Salander.  However, one emerges from the second book with a sense of repugnance for Larsson's world and Lisbeth Salander as well.  What began as an intriguing personality degenerates into a contradictory character lacking in credibility and depth.  Salander in the second book is the result of a prurient male fantasy with about as much substance as a comic book character - the antithesis of Wonder Woman's pop cultural appeal.  I find it puzzling and upsetting that among all the books out there that this book has achieved iconic status on so little merit.  It is as if the global economic downturn has affected people's literary intelligence and that sensational, vacuous fiction is all that has survived the tumult.<br /><br />Like Ken Follette's \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" and others of similar intent, Larsson appears to enjoy an audience of people who desire blood, gratuitous violence and pathology.  Pop culture encourages immediate gratification even if the achieved pleasure is nonsensical and borne of simplistic tastes and very little insight into life and the broader questions of human existence posed by such literary critics as Aristotle and other great thinkers, writers and critics.  In fact, no thought is required to metabolize Follette, Larrson or Patterson, for that matter, just a lust for cheap, cheesy entertainment.<br /><br />Such sensational literary gimmicks as sexual bondage, sado-masochism, murder, rape, pedophilia,  female abuse, lesbianism, bisexuality, drugs, drug and human trafficking, nymphomania, incest, patricide, pornography, dwarfs, prostitutes, and the briny worlds of thugs and pimps and international crime are fixated on by Larsson and barely developed in the ongoing quest to entertain the insatiable demands of some readers who appreciate quick jolts of violence,  murder and abuse and all the dark experiences denied the person caught up in the treadmill of down-turned global economies.  The fact that people are praising this kind of book speaks horribly to what the human reading preference is in the post-modern world.  And these are not thin, easy reads.  One has to plow through purple or cumbersome prose to focus on the incredulity of it all, as if modern readers merely need action, no matter how insipid, to divert them from the realconcerns of modern existence.  This appears to be the crushing result of poor English instruction in the schools, of readers more bent on instant voyeuristic gratification than wisdom from thoughtful reading, of people more desirous to escape their mundane lives than to experience  aesthetics or insight into the human condition.  Such \\"art\\" is the expression of the hack, of one's willingness to vomit it all out in the name of entertainment, always hopeful to make money on that which fails to achieve much more than the appeasement of man's craving for sordidness  without meaning.  One even gets the impression that the authors described here get off on their bizarre depictions of human depravity since there is little psychological insight derived from reading about the characters or the inane plots through which they tread, ever so lightly and insignificantly.<br /><br />In \\"Tattoo,\\" Lisbeth Salander was appealing because she was unusual.  Pierced in various body parts, a hacker by inclination, and a shrewd deviant in looks and thinking, she presented as multi-layered and mysterious.  One assumed she had thoughts of a different nature than most people, and from her implied family background, the reader assumed a suffering that should endow her with the imaginative and insightful characteristics that make for an intriguing heroine.  She dismisses Mikael Blomkvist when she deems him insignificant for whatever reason.  She takes her own sexual pleasure, not letting him set the rules by which their relationship proceeds, suggesting a laudable female independence.  She is not afraid of violence or defending herself.  Ah, Lisbeth, you seem too good to be true, one thinks --- until she reveals all her quirks, eccentricities and inanity in the sequel, \\"Fire.\\"  Then we see a woman who defies credibility, who is anti-social and amoral to the point of psychopathology, who is vindictive, self-serving and somewhat dull in her lack of imagination in dealing with the grim world that surrounds her.  One might posit she has a steely soul as well as an empty heart --- both as empty of joy and compassion as the snowy Swedish landscape.  She is a boxer, an expert motorcycle mechanic, a shrewd, brilliant hacker, an elfish, delicate woman, a lesbian, a bisexual, a piercer of body parts, a world traveler, a benevolent friend, an authority on business, the world, the country, and any other subject one could suggest.  She defies believability because she is a projection of Larsson's yearning more than a real woman.  One loses interest in her personality when it continues to defy belief.  That she enjoys inflicting pain on her tormenter may appear all right to begin with, but as the book proceeds, one feels dirty experiencing Salander's sick revenge and her joyless interludes.  This is because she is not a believable character and because her experiences are so dreary and empty that we feel contaminated by reading about them.  Moreover, how Lisbeth really feels and any depth that might reside in her self-contained facade is not expressed by the writer.  Although Blomkvist assumes Salander is innocent of the crimes she is charged with, and her protector states that \\"she is one of the most moral persons he has ever known,\\" the perceptive reader cannot agree because Salander's character is not sufficiently developed to arouse our empathy or our understanding.  She is the result of a desire on Larsson's part to pluck out of the world every sensational detail that might stick in the reader lusting for a lurid voyeuristic experience.  Whatever sticks appears to be Larsson's rule in maintaining his audience.  This is a sad commentary on what sells, frankly.  Where is the readers' grounding in literature?  In fact, who nurtured these readers' literary taste?  Who taught them how to read and formed their literary sensibilities?  Who helped to develop their aesthetic tastes to the point that they could discern literature from hackneyed blab?  I'm mortified that such a book as \\"Fire\\" is a world bestseller.  It says more than I want to recognize about the lack of education and the superficiality of the modern reader.  At the same time, I must say that most of the intelligent readers I know as well as many highly regarded critics do recognize the shortcomings of this book.  Still, it is disconcerting that with the vast selection of good literature available worldwide so many people gravitate to such a piece as \\"The Girl who Played with Fire.\\"<br /><br />The book has a host of minor characters that confuse the narrative and rarely assume any kind of intellectual or descriptive significance.  In fact, many of the characters blur together because they are parts of various subplots that weigh down the storyline and obscure the theme and purpose of the book as a whole.  The giant Zala emerges as one of these, even though his appearance alone suggests intrigue, and the fact that he has a curious immunity to pain, arouses our interest.  However, as the book proceeds this giant of form and function is revealed in his banality, too.  He is merely another thug among many and hardly interesting since he ostensibly does not think.  Thus, he is part of the yawning scenario of too many minor characters, forced subplots, and meandering dialogue.<br /><br />Much of the book is repetitive as if Larsson failed to remember the wordy episodes he'd wrought, or worse, that he didn't trust the intelligence of the reader and thus had to remind him of characters, plot and theme.  Meanwhile, throughout all the vicissitudes of plot and characterization, Lisbeth Salander hides away in her undiscovered villa wide eyed and astonished at the ruckus her presence has caused throughout the world.  Yeah, tell me more I don't believe.  Larsson notes, \\"Her eyes grew wide with astonishment as she followed the stories in the online editions of the newspapers and on the TV news programs.\\"  Moreover, \\"She was irritated by the passport photograph that appeared everywhere.  She looked stupid.\\"  Thus does Salander emerge as a sycophant, hardly interesting, more inane and mundane than the world one might seek to escape through reading such prurience and barely beyond trivial and vain.  Not the stuff of heroines or even mildly interesting women, for that matter.<br /><br />Huge passages detail Salander's notorious background, portraying her as unsavory, while she watches the accounts on television and reads online versions of her own personality.  Larsson says at one point, \\"As Salander watched Teleborian's face on TV, her heart became a little lump of ice.\\"  Oh, really?  Unfortunately, her heart is revealed as just that by the author's singular lack of adequate characterization -- complete characterization being the mark of the true novelist.  Although we might be moved to empathy for Salander's sexual victimhood, we lose it when we feel it is gratuitously presented as porn for our insipid pleasure.  As the author describes Salander, \\"When she feels threatened, she reacts with excessive violence.\\"  This appears an effort to rationalize her apparent sociopathic tendencies which are glossed over as if to suggest such belligerent over-reactivity is commendable, perhaps desirable in a woman.  Again, it is the writer of sensationalism who has found a sado-masochistic voyeurism in much of his audience, it would seem.  It doesn't matter that these are the words of one of Salander's detractors; she is nevertheless amoral in many of her actions.  \\"She's more of an egomaniacal psychopath,\\" says another observer.  \\"Everyone else around her is unimportant.\\"  Again ,there is the suggestion that narcissism or extreme self-absorption is laudable, when, in fact, it is not ultimately interesting.  People are a mixture of positive and negative traits; for some reason Larsson does not characterize a person of any real emotional depth, of any believable complexity, just aberration or emotional immaturity.  Of course, the real mystery, if there is indeed any in this book, is the question of who Lisbeth Salander really is?  This theme might have been enough for me to finish the book and even go on to the next in the trilogy.  However, as it was, I lost interest in \\"Fire\\" because that which I had read it for in the first place failed to meet my expectations.  The woman Salander ultimately left me cold.  I found her unbelievable, extreme, nasty, and petty, incapable of authentic and varied emotions except vengeance, and totally self-gratification oriented and contrived.  In the end, she did not arouse my imagination but instead repelled me.  That aspect along with a convoluted plot, prosaic and repetitive dialogue and passages, boring characters, and a mish-mash of violence, alas, derailed me.  It was all I could do to slog on through the book.  To me it is boring nonsense.<br /><br />Yet what disturbs me most is that the book is so widely read.  What does this say about our literary taste?  What does it reveal about the depth of readers' insight and their passion or lack thereof for literature that if done well, grounds one in wisdom and humanity?  What does this suggest about the education of people who read this sort of fiction when there are so many great pieces of literature as well as so many books that open our lives to the beauty of our fellow man as well as the truths of the world rather than immerse us in the ugliness and banality of damaged people and depravity in general?

B003NHRGSQ|4.0|this book is really good. it was a amazing second book and i would recmond it to anyone who has read shiver
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|I was beyond disappointed in this purchase.  First of all, they mislead you into thinking this is two-disc, DVD and Blu-Ray disc in one package.  But you get only one disc with two sides containing the movies in both formats.  Although they use the VOB format for the DVD, I have not found any players that will play this on a computer.  Since I travel a lot, I like to watch movies on my laptop which is the reason for the two format purchase!  But now, no way to do that.  Add to that the fact that it took Amazaon a full two weeks to send this to me added to my dissatisfaction with this purchase.  I fully intend to send this back as it was not what was advertised in the listing for this product!
B002ZG974M|5.0|Last Mother's Day, my 32 year old son took me to see this movie in the theater. It was the perfect 'mother's day gift'....  These babies were all so wonderful, different culturally, and yet the same...crawling, curious, crying, bonding with their loved ones...It was a wonderful film, and culturally, very interesting.. observing the over coddled Japanese baby [who has a giant LOL temper tantrum~ which is hysterical !! ~ to the adorable African baby just crawling around amidst all the animals [and them drinking out of his bath water, while baby was still in the tub!]... There are wonderful, wonderful scenes in this movie that you'll not see elsewhere.  Babies are nursed out in the open, so if this bothers you, just be aware [although as a former 'nursing mom', I loved it for it's freedom and totally natural 'order of things'[...   I am now getting it for my daughter, who is 4 months pregnant with her first child, as a Christmas present, so we can watch it together during Christmas..                                          judy
0439023521|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I kind of avoided The Hunger Games like the plague when I first started really getting in to YA, and now I'm probably one of the last to read it. I really, really regret only picking it up now.    Katniss is a wonderful girl, with so much thrust upon her at a young age, that you can't help but empathize with her. Her determination to never appear weak is admirable, and her strength is incomparable. I love super strong female leads, and Katniss does not disappoint at one single point - even when she lets her hard outer shell crack just a bit.  *Mini-spoiler!* The scene with Rue made me extremely teary-eyed.    I'm not going to go on and on about how wonderful this book is, because there are hundreds of reviews already out there saying the exact same thing. Hundreds of thousands of people already know how entirely awesome this series is, and I'm totally jealous I missed out on all the real Mockingjay hype earlier this summer.    Basically, I'm just really glad I have all three checked out from my library, because I just devoured the last half of The Hunger Games in one sitting, and I'm itching for more.    (As of right now, I'm totally Team Peeta, but I just feel like I haven't seen enough of Gale yet to be absolutely firm. We'll see how my feelings develop!)

B000OVLBHG|4.0|Please keep in mind that I read the book just 1 week before the movie came out and I loved it (the book). I then went and saw the movie, I loved that too. However, the one thing I noticed right from the start was that there is more action and fight scenes in the movie previews than in the whole book! While I do love both book and movie just keep in mind that the book is a \\"thinking\\" story and the movie is an \\"action\\" story. I would recommend either to check out.

B0042816YK|4.0|The book was great, and this film does a good job of capturing the essence of the interior life of Elizabeth Gilbert. I agree with a friend of mine, Julia Roberts is an excellent actress, however someone less famous would probably have been more appropriate for this role. Kyra Sedgwick would have been my choice. She has the same quirky edge that Gilbert has. All in all the film is good. Director Ryan Murphy is pure joy in what he does with GLEE, but I would have liked perhaps a European director and crew to have made this film or Ryan Murphy could have utilized textures from European films, shadows, solitude, and angst. For some reason the film doesn't quite do that, but all in all I would recommend it. Love Javier Bardem.
0385512058|5.0|Every now and then, one reads a truly inspirational book full of practical advice that can be put to immediate use. This is definitely a book that falls into that category. Keith discusses in details one of the primary keys of success in building relationships. He details different ways to expand one's network and build contacts, and more importantly how to manage, maintain and grow these relationships through continuous follow-up. The key to success being establishing such win-win relationships in which success will breed more success. The book is filled with practical advice from building birthday logs, to a master contact list, to a board of advisers. This is in addition to Keith's extended personal experiences that demonstrate these techniques and how they are applied. Finally, it also includes examples of historical figures who demonstrated exceptional relationship management and their ensuing success (Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere, etc.). One of my favorite quotes in the book is: \\" Poverty, I realized, wasn't only the lack of financial resources; it was isolation from the kind of people that could help you make more of yourself.\\"<br /><br />A must read in addition to Dale Carnegie's classic How to Win Friends and Influence People - a classic in that field.
1439177783|5.0|This was a great book.  Portia grabs the reader in the first page as she takes you through her ups and downs of the need to be the \\"perfect\\" weight for a model and later an actress.  She describes how anexoria took over her life completely - right down to the voices convincing her that she was never \\"good enough\\".<br /><br />It was a miracle that she survived the punishment she put her body through.  I feel that anyone even close to dealing with this illness should read this book and save themselves from the horror that Portia lived through.

142311339X|5.0|In this new hit series, \\"The Lost Hero\\", a young unexpected hero and his two friends begin a journey like no other. They will face almost certain death, not to mention the Greek and Roman Gods themselves, on a quest to destroy the ruler of the Earth, whose name I will not reveal. This action/thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Rick Riordan does a wonderful job describing Jason and his friends' lives as demigods. I can only imagine how hard it is to write a 500 page book on something with which you have no experience whatsoever. He does a splendid job on keeping you reading this book by putting cliffhangers after almost every chapter. Not only are there 3 main characters, but he changes the perspective of the book based on one of those 3 characters every chapter. Rick Riordan has successfully started a new bestseller series.     I am going to reveal some of the best parts of this book. I might reveal some of the worst, if possible. One of the funniest parts of the book is when Leo is cracking a joke. He is one of the characters that made me want to keep reading, the funny little guy! One of the most romantic parts in the book is when Jason and Piper, his \\"girlfriend\\", are alone at last and they can just hug each other. This was very rare because they were usually fighting monsters or stuff like that. One of the most suspenseful parts is when an evil lady is persuading Leo and Jason to fight to the death. Piper eventually stops them and they escape the mall before it explodes. The worst part of the book was the end because Jason didn't get his memory back, and the fight isn't over, so it is a major cliffhanger! I can't wait until the next book to give it a review like this!    Josh D., Mrs. Rodriguez's Class, A4
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I'm a music fan, but not so much rap or hip hop.  That said, this is a brilliant album.  You cannot deny genius and this is the real deal.  The lyrics and composition are amazing.

It is sheer genius.

B00192IV9U|1.0|I ADORE Michael Jackson, and have over 98 of his songs and all of his videos. This is an insult to Michael as an artist, and as a person. Michael would have never approved this cr**. Is this Michael singing? YES, I believe that is Michael's voice, at least on most of the songs. I have recognized his voice without difficulty. But having Michael's voice is far from sufficient to make good music. It is unbelievable what these greedy people have done to Michael's enormous talent. They have literally USED his voice. They have popped his voice into an OSTERIZER BLENDER together with a lot of bass (horrendous!) and a DEFAULT choir which is all over the place, sings NONSTOP and ends up being nerve racking. Even a synthetizer would have done a better job! Michael knew very well what to do with each instrument, he knew how much bass he wanted and when, he knew how much choir or back-up singers he wanted and when, he knew all about the ingredients needed for an oustanding musical recipe, he knew exactly how much to use of each and the exact moment in which they had to be used and for how long. Michael knew it all and he was GENIUS. These tracks are not the work of a GENIUS, they are the work of a bunch of greedy businessmen and shoddy musicians who know little about music and who believe they can trick all of us, MJ fans, to like this. I LOVE, WORSHIP, ADORE MICHAEL JACKSON and his incredible, unbelievable, unique talent. I love Michael Jackson the Man, the Artist, the Creator, the Genius. Not this! This is Michael's voice, and some of the songs are good, but this is not ***Michael's Music*** and I seriously doubt he would have ever approved of this. ***Michael Jackson forever.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|I have been watching Dr. Who since John Pertwee and I can say without prejudice that the recent seasons are far better than anything done before...better effects, better writing, better characters.  The 5th season has a new production/writing team, but the writing and characters do not suffer for it.  The first episode is a great intro to the new season, and the last episode (2 parter)is the best yet of the finales.  Some of the plots are a little weak but the character interactions are wonderful.  I am particularly fond of the Vampires of Venice and Vincent and the Doctor.  Amy and Rory make great companions, River Song reappears a couple times and the Daleks go in a little bit new direction (the specials include talking to the developers about this).  There are also a couple extended scenes which I really wish they had kept in originally, so they aren't just time wasters.  I am guessing anyone who is a fan of the new series will by these, but if you are a Dr. Who fan, season 5 is certainly a worthy addition to your collection, just as the last 4 were.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Loved the first one, now I've had the fun of sharing both with my own children (all loved them both). The soundtrack was incredible visuals pure eyecandy (again a GOOD thing). I loved the little tips of the hat to the first movie such as Sam's comment about the door. When you watch/rent/buy this movie make sure you just want to sit back and have fun. It bothers me when I read reviews of movies such as this one and they tear it apart. The reviewers look for things that the movie was never meant to be about. Its meant to allow us to suspend belief for a couple hours out of our mundane existence and JUST HAVE FUN. If your so into nitpicking everything to death, do the rest of us a favor and go back into your box and don't leave. Enjoy the movie for what it was meant to be, entertainment. Stop looking for how things would be in the real world...don't we all get enough of that already?
B001UHOWXI|4.0|All I was looking for was a review of the Blu-Ray version of this movie.

I WISH AMAZON WOULD NOT MIX REVIEWS OF \\"LIKE\\" PRODUCTS. !! It is almost as bad as their product descriptions which are totally lame. We don't need any reviews of the movie anymore than we need a review of Gone with the Wind or Wizard of OZ. I just wanted to know if people thought the Blu-Ray was of good enough quality..

030745455X|4.0|Lisbeth Salander, the trilogy's fiesty protaganist, is back, but not before she gets involved in straightening things out with a would-be wife-murderer. She makes her way back in Sweden, but finds herself at the scene and implicated in a triple murder, sort of on the run, and looking to seek out and settle scores with her antagonists. Blomkvist and Aramansky do not believe so, and try to dig into the mess. We learn a lot more about Salander, her family, her background, and \\"All that evil\\" that happened in Salander's life when she was not even a teenager. There are several more characters in this plot than were in the first book, and it is not immediately clear what specific purpose they serve. However, the author takes pains to etch out each character with some detail, so that is commendable.<br /><br />The book's first half is slower than the second. The plot moves but slowly, and at times you start wondering whether this second book is going to be anywhere as good to the first one. The second half picks up, and things start to happen fast. There are not as many surprises or completely unforeseen twists in this book as the first one, except maybe one.<br /><br />This second book also takes aim at the underbelly of Sweden's society, and the cesspool of flesh trade that carries on, and it is not pleasant.<br /><br />The ending of the second book sets up the third one very nicely. I can't wait to pick up the third book in the series.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|the story is amazing and an instant classic. the 1000 something pages flew by in 4 short days. however if this rich story was called a steak then there would be a little fat along the edges. some of what stephen king is writing about has little or almost no reason to be in. like ging so in depth with the death at the beginning of 1985 or mike hanlons interludes. somethings are jut unneccesary like mikes dads life and what the losers do after beating IT in 1958. but overall once you get past the slow open it is a genuine treat
0061122416|4.0|is a short read,very powerful content inside this book--powerful message overall,very adventurous and exciting...the boy is obsessed with that inner voice the language of the world and to meet up with his personal legend he must! very intense adventure--i really recommend this book to anyone who is into Drama/Adventure---Maktub!

B00003CX95|1.0|This movie is the a bunch of junk. First William wallace was not a highlander most of the soldiers at striling were lowlanders and they would be simirally dressed like their english counterparts tough a little more poorly. The scottish aristocracy would be dressed like knights like englishmen. Many of the scottish nobles held lands on both sides since the arrival of norman knights to scotland on urging of the rulers there. There is no evidence that highland tartans ever existed. Edward longshank would not be afraid to fight wallace he was noted for his strength and bravey and always getting into the thick of the battle. The French princess would not be able to hide her thoughts by speaking French since that was the only langauge Longshank spoke, his mother was french he had lived in France and the English nobles still spoke French as there First language. William wallace was no fan of Robert The Bruce he was a supporter of John Bailliol, Bruce wasn't a confused idealist he was a brutal ruler like mosts, and had even murdered another claimait to the thrown, and the highlaners were not that loyal to the scottish crown ,some of them were still in allegiance to the king of Norway.the only good part of this movie was proably that sophie marceau was in it.

Of the eight that we purchased, only one worked. Kind of. Actually, it worked poorly. Against my advice, they exchanged rather than returned them all. Lo and behold, of the next batch of garbage none of them worked. These are the biggest peices of junk I've ever seen marketed as toys. Even worse than Happy Meal Toys. Only buy them if you like to make your children cry or if you like to return things and leave mean reviews!

He artfully picks the fruit of philosophers from Socrates to Newton to Einstein, and to the forefront of today's scientific thinking.<br /><br />Then, he magnificently leaps into the depths of quantum physics, bringing the reader to a certain level of comfort with the idea that there are not three, not four dimensions, but rather, ten.<br /><br />Hawking again asks Einstein's question, \\"Did God have any choice when he created the universe?\\" He takes us along the journey his mind has pondered, and entices even those of us who are not scientists to look at the questions of creation and human potential in a new and satisfying way.<br /><br />This book is probably one of the most important books of 2010, simply in the relatively easy way he brings his readers into today's most progressive laboratories, today's discussions on quantum theory and M-theory, and into the realm of great thinkers throughout history, which certainly includes Professors Hawking and Mlodinow.

B00192IV9U|1.0|I must also chime in with the other negative reviews in that some of these songs are CLEARLY not Michael Jackson and it's a sad attempt to cash in one of the greatest musicians of all time.  For that reason alone you should download this album the ski mask way because there are a few gems on here that are vintage MJ.  However, I can't justify actually buying this album knowing that at least 3 songs have been doctored beyond recognition.  Honestly some of these songs made me laugh.  It was funny because the producers and the decision makers really thought that after all the solo albums and Jackson 5 Christmas albums and regular albums, concerts, features etc. that the general public (there's some 50 Cent language for you) doesn't know what Michael Jackson sounds like.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|My family thoroughly enjoys this album all the way through -  but if you don't absolutely LOVE their version of Auld Lang Syne, well you just might want to check your pulse.  Best version of that song ever made.    Overall, this is a great addition to any Christmas music collection, with a combination of lovely songs you likely don't have on any other album and interpretations of traditional favorites that are given a Pink Martini twist.  Unless you have a problem with non-traditional or international holiday songs, this is highly recommended.

B002VECM6S|5.0|While some think this film is yet another ooey gooey look at how cute and nice human nature can be featurette, I just saw a totally different thing going on here.  \\"The Blind Side\\" is not \\"Rocky\\". It's based on a true story, it actually happened, and for the general public to become immediately suspicious about the circumstances and the veracity of a woman like Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Sandra Bullock) and husband Sean Tuohy (played by Tim McGraw) to not only assist but adopt, put through school, and eventually make into a high school football star a mute, sullen black kid named Michael (Quinton Aaron) from the poorest side of Tennessee is a bit frightening.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job (only problem I had with her performance is that it diminished Sean Tuouhy's role in this semi-miracle and makes him look emasculated) as Leigh Anne Tuouhy, a woman who you imagine belongs to the Tea Party, votes Republican, and doesn't think too much beyond her next interior home decoration.  A sweet family with two nice kids and a lot of money, everything is picture perfect until two very different fates collide.<br /><br />Michael is a big, gentle giant from the projects who is so silent as to be mute.  He is given a transfer from his public school to a private school because they don't know what to do with him.  His mother is a crack addict and his father is AWOL.  This young man has the marks of poverty all over him--the only bed he has to sleep in is an inflatable mattress that falls apart under his massive frame.  Quinton Aaron's performance is so effective that he almost seems to be apart from this world entirely, so little is he loved or cared for.<br /><br />One day Leigh Anne and her husband see him walking in a rainstorm, leaving the school bleachers where he was picking up bags of discarded popcorn to eat.<br /><br />The long and short: Leigh Anne Touhy and her family did something that most of us would not even consider doing, perhaps even if we had the resources.  The moral audacity of this kind of act is what makes it so unique: it doesn't happen much.  Michael is now an all star football player due to the efforts of these people who didn't know him.  (And yeah, this happened in the South.  I was surprised too.)<br /><br />A great film, uplifting and not in an unrealistic or corny way.ty of this kind of act is what makes it so unique: it doesn't happen much.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|As a long time fan of James Cameron's work I really enjoyed the documentaries and supplemental materials provided in this package. Seeing the new technology that was created for this via the virtual camera and 3D camera system he used was incredible as well as seeing how much work Weta and everyone involved put into this. From coming up with a full language, to developing an entire cultural history to creating every single item of clothing, armor and weapons used by the digital characters to be used as models, motion guides and textures was above and beyond. Cameron is nothing short of one of the most dedicated film artists out there at the moment and how much work he puts into his projects is truly astounding. I highly recommend this box set!

B003XX2PPO|2.0|Of course, I loved the boleros and the ballets!  Luis Miguel excels in these, always!   But, what a shame..., he's still recording 'out dated' sounding up beat, fast tempo songs.  Especially, the last song on the album, which the intro sounds like it came from an \\"old disco\\" track.  Listen, it's quite embarrassing, the 'lack of 'styling' his upbeat image and sound.  Yeah, of course, I love his voice, but, this 'production' especially on the 'fast' tracks was boring at best.

It is a little scattered and less specifically directional that I had hoped it would be. ie (if you want to look/feel like this then do this..take these supps) etc. It would have been nice to see some more specifics on what supplements have been taken together should you gravitate toward more than one idea in the book. All and all very good and motivational. Tim Ferris is doing what we all strive to do. Have fun and get paid to do it. Good for him.

I wish dimensions for this product were included in the description. As I look at it again now, the dimensions are noted on the blue cover of the item itself, but I had to adjust the magnification on my screen several times to be able to read it clearly.    This is probably not a deal breaker for most people, and Moleskine products are excellent. It was just a surprise to receive the notebook and find it so much smaller than predicted, is all.

Furthermore, my digestion has significantly improved. There is a lot of science in this book, but even following the most basic suggestions can yield dramatic results in a very short time. The only trick is that you have to be disciplined enough to do it. I bought this book because i knew 15 bucks would be the best investment I could make in my health and physical performance. Thanks Tim!

B003VIW8DK|5.0|Bryan's solo albums/CDs have been hit-or-miss for me, a great fan of Roxy Music, over the years. \\"Taxi\\" grinds my nerves, and I don't like his Dylan imitations at all. But I know he's capable of great things, so I haven't given up on him.<br /><br />This CD proves my faith in Bryan was worth maintaining. It's a very tasteful, carefully planned, collection of beautiful songs. His gentle, sexually-alluring voice hasn't changed all that much over the years, so it is easy to be lulled into visualizing him as still a young man as he sings of roaming endlessly through clubs seeking the right girl to fall in love with. The lyrics tend to remind the listener of his disastrous relationship with Jerry Hall, but that may be my projection as he sings of the love he lost and would give anything to get back.<br /><br />Eno, Manzanero and other old friends (and enemies) help build the luxurious sound of this CD. I dare say I'd compare the soothing loveliness of the music to Roxy's \\"Avalon\\" CD only with more of the Ferry influence. The songs are slow or medium, toe-tapping pace, so don't expect any real rocking tunes.<br /><br />I do like the CD very much and hope Bryan continues to record more. The old boy's still got it!
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|Which is why I enjoyed it. Don't expect any emotional or philosophical messaging or stimulation here, just plain action and gore. Having the two competing Predators was an interesting twist.
B000005RMY|3.0|Of the 19 songs (one only about 30 sec. long), the only one that I really love is \\"Alice,\\" purportedly relating to Alice of Wonderland fame. The problems with the majority of the songs are the super long intros before any singing begins, the length (too long) of the meandering instrumental songs or sections, and the monotony of the sound. At least I finally got a copy of \\"Alice,\\" which I wasn't able to purchase at Amazon as an mp3. The group's cover of the Stooges' \\"1969\\" is interesting. Their cover of \\"Gimme Shelter\\" didn't hit the spot with me, however.<br /><br />I would only recommend this collection of the groups early work to real die-hard fans who have a lot of patience, or someone who thinks having a good copy of \\"Alice\\" makes the cost of the CD worth it. The drum machine tends to give me a headache after a while, and this CD is FILLED with drum machine.<br /><br />I prefer their later work with the female singer and orchestral additions.
B004G6009K|5.0|Tangled is an amazing movie! The story is very well written and the pace of the movie never gets boring. Alan Menken's score is breathtaking! Easily one of my favorite Disney movies of ALL TIME, and I grew up in the second golden age of The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty And the Beast, ect.  I have seen the movie twice in the theater. I cannot recall EVER going to the see a movie a second time in the theater. I actually might see it again in 3D as it was stunning! Also One of Disney's  best villains in my opinion. The psychological aspect of Mother Gothel is deep.    Don't miss this new age Disney classic. Perfect for everyone in your family. It will warm your heart, make you laugh and cry and gives you that Disney magic feeling we have been waiting for since Beauty and the Beast! Amazing!!    I cannot wait for this to come out on Blu-Ray. I even thought about getting a 3D tv..Yeah this movie was that good in 3D for me...haha
B00164KYV4|2.0|Overall, this movie did not translate well from book to screen because the dramatic hit home of the lessons was lost in a poorly written and executed story.<br />I read the book several years ago, and found myself hugely disappointed it hadn't  been written when I was much much younger because it would have saved me a lot of wasted energy on the wrong men (or at least a lot of them).<br />The movie followed five different women with brief follows on three of their men, some of them friends with each other, and their relationships or lack of, and issues with men.  I understand the idea of using female characters to relay the messages. However, I found the implementation of that, sort of a let down.  A lot of the lessons were lost.  I wasn't drawn in to the characters and their lives.  They seemed uninteresting, sort of wishy washy, and they did not truly evolve as chracters, which is the whole point of the story.<br />The one woman, who wants to get married, breaks up with her bfriend of seven years because he hasn't made the move towards marriage, ends up letting go of her marriage dream and gets back together with him.  So where is the lesson or real growth from her character?  Because I was confused.  Is it that she was too hung up on being married?  I don't know.  Didn't make sense to me.<br />So for me, this was a let down.  If you really want the lessons, read the book instead.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Such a great film. Kate Winslet gives a great performance as always. One of Cameron Diaz' best movies in my opinion.  A great romantic dramedy.
030746363X|5.0|Although the marketing and hype around the book might seem a little full on or even off putting to some, I was pleasantly surprised at how much Tim encouraged scepticism of his own claims and methods, as long as you just took action and actually tested it out for yourself. He supplies a guide to spot bad science and how to track variables. I've currently seen results from the increasing testosterone chapters, the sleeping one, and I'm starting the slow carb diet ones. Each little success with the fun I've had tracking results really adds fuel to the fire and after 2 successes with real results I can't wait to tackle and track the results I get with the diet.    So far so good Tim, can't wait for the revised edition once everyone else comes in posting their results a few months down the line.

030746363X|5.0|This is a great book. Here is what I got from it; It is a Manual of sorts.. as Tim states. A lot of the information you have heard before, and most of it, in my case.. was from him. Reading his first book brought a lot of insight to specific areas of my life that I went on to expand my knowledge about. This is a great reference guide containing those facts and ideas, and more.<br /><br />It is very interesting to read about the trials and studies that Tim and his friends did.. and already I have implemented a few of the ideas into my life. As a reference guide, it is a very useful tool in weight loss, muscle building, and life-hacking. It's a great resource. Thanks Tim!

Her experiences and her relationships are alive and make you feel as though you are there with her.  I know why she got a Book Award for this book.

030746363X|4.0|Update II: After 3 months without exercise or supplements I've lost 20 lbs. The weight loss seems to be flat-lining now - which is why I'm about to begin a vigorous exercise regimen in combination with the diet. But again, don't listen to naysayers and people who say something can't be done just cause they've never done it.    Update: Doing the Slow Carb diet now for 12 days and already down 10 lbs on the digital scale. Which is amazing because outside of the cooking and prep time for food -- this diet is effortless and definitely doesn't leave your feeling deprived. It really feels like I've lost weight without making some giant sacrifice in portions. Today is my free day so I'm off to get some Cadbury chocolate bars. Don't listen to naysayers - listen to results. Can't wait to try the other stuff out.    Original Review: After finally reading the Four Hour Body for myself (as much of the 600 pages total that I plan to read in this first sitting), I intend to write a review that is comprehensive and critical while contending with the claims of other reviewers which I've read here. This is a long review, but the gist of it is that it is imperative for all potential readers to think for themselves! Think for yourselves because too many people are reviewing the author and not this book. Think for yourself because this book cannot be all things to all people; we all have different bodies and different starting levels of both fitness and fitness education - what this book will be to you depends on you. From reading the book, I think it can have tremendous value for a large cross-section of fitness novices and fitness freaks alike; for novices it can be a broad discussion you've never heard of and for fitness freaks it can be one little thing you didn't know before.    Let me start off with identifying myself -- because apparently there are some paranoid people who think that every review must either say \\"this is impossible\\" or else it is an Indian outsourcer being paidby Tim Ferriss to write it. I am not now nor have I ever been on Tim Ferriss's payroll - and have only met him twice. Once, by chance on the streets of New York for 10 minutes; and recently he had a launch party here in NYC for this book that I attended and exchanged about 40 seconds worth of pleasantries with him. Maybe it is because I have seen the man breathe that I don't feel the need to either deify or demonize him to the extent that others here have.    Let me also add that I read his previous book, the [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated: Expanded and Updated, With Over 100 New Pages of Cutting-Edge Content.]], and have been impressed by his ideas ever since; only because I saw the results I wanted when I tried his methods. I truly wish it was possible to review the Four Hour Body(4HB) without any reference to the Four Hour Work Week (4HWW); but the strong emotions that Ferriss evokes from people who love him and hate him are in large part inspired by that first book.    In short the first book was entirely ground-breaking! It advocated that people should work only as little as necessary and get the most done in the time they are working. Ferriss believes many emails/conversations/meetings in a corporate work environment are make-work devices and that some of the hours we spend at work everyday can be safely eliminated or efficiently automated and/or outsourced. He also challenges the idea that we need to work first then retire by introducing the concept of mini-retirements - which is breaking up the idea of a long retirement into distributed periods of rest throughout your life. The Four Hour Workweek is a book title -- but it is not an actual, literal number of work hours that the author is advocating you should work. Yet some people, whose intellectual faculties I hold in contempt, seem to interpret the book as advocating exactly that. These people hate Ferriss, they think he's a snake-oil salesman who is advocating a slacker lifestyle; they say that it's impossible for you to work only 4 hours a week even though Ferriss doesn't advocate that himself; they say society would collapse if everyone only worked four hours; and that no real business that actually adds value to society can function if the owner works only four hours a week. Never mind that my dry cleaner and his wife sometimes go to Korea for 6 months at a time - while his son in law runs the place; apparently their business doesn't provide value.    I shamefully admit that I have read the false critiques of Ferriss by these types of people and ignored or even welcomed them because it was good for me. If everyone was on Elance hiring Indian illustrators to create logos (as I have since reading the 4HWW)then the cost of Indian labor on Elance would rise. So if you don't do it because you read a misguided review and were too stupid to think for yourself - then good for me.    The 4HB is different however, whether you do it or not doesn't affect me; which is precisely why I think it would be wonderful if everyone tried the advice in this book. So let me transition into a review of 4HB which oddly can be wrapped up in a two paragraphs below. Most of the negative reviews of this book make only a few arguments. Some people bought the book on here so they could make an \\"Amazon verified purchase\\" review even though they had no plans to read the book. Their criticism pretty much says \\"This book is snake-oil - and everything in the book is available elsewhere.\\" This is a highly incoherent criticism because if all the insights in this book are available elsewhere then why isn't it snake-oil when other people say it?!? Most reviewers never address that fundamental flaw in their logic.     They also say that certain examples Ferriss talks about in the book are simply *gasp* \\"impossible.\\" And I maintained an open mind to that claim of his critics as I read the book -- then I came across the section on Michael Phelps (the Olympic swim champ). The section is all about the effect of temperature on weight-loss. Ferriss uses an insight by a NASA scientist to show that cold temperatures can help to activate more rapid weight-loss. This is a huge realization which I have never read anywhere else and which made the book worth the money for me. But the other takeaway from that section for me was the discussion of how many calories Michael Phelps consumes a day - 12,000! If the section had been about Philip Michaels (someone you don't know) then the critics here would have been saying it was impossible; and that no Olympic athlete could consume that many calories without looking like a house and falling out of performance conditioning. Yet because Phelps has been on TV eating his high calorie breakfast - no-one challenges that claim with the \\"it's impossible\\" mantra. I can't imagine that Random House Publishing or Tim Ferriss the angel investor & start-up advisor would do the sort of damage to their name that would come from blatant lying. Yet many reviewers here, without any evidence other than their own incredulity, accuse them of just that. His critics here also accuse him of gaming the reviews - because they find it hard to believe that advance copy reviewers (many of whom are Tim Ferriss fans already) would have liked the book and made a review on the first day. And finally his critics here just lie; one said he doesn't address stretching even though there is a discussion on that; another said he mentions lifters' results without mentioning 'steroids' - even though there are four pages just on steroids and pro-abuse of steroids.    No-one can write a definitive review of this book without trying out the things Ferriss describes.  I've made actual money because I read his first book - not earth-shattering yet but I'm still on the journey. For this book I have my annual physical coming up next week. Then, I'm going to do the [[ASIN:0060193395 Body for Life: 12 Weeks to Mental and Physical Strength]] 12 week cycle (which I've done before) while on the Slow Carb diet Ferriss talks about. And while on it I will use the Cold Temperatures Ferriss introduced to me in this book. If it works or not I will edit this review to let you know. But I strongly encourage you to do the same - buy the book and try the stuff. At the every least it is an intriguing and informative read that has already provided me with hours of conversation topics.
030746363X|5.0|We thought we knew - but now we know for sure.  He's a madman.    Four Hour Body chronicles Tim's obsessive quest to optimize the human body, fearlessly self-experimenting and pushing his body to the limit.  The book is organized in a \\"choose your own adventure\\" format, where the reader can choose between fat loss, muscle gain, improving sex, becoming superhuman, and more.    Tim's storytelling shines as in 4HWW - extravagant stories and Tim's witty euphemisms make it a very fun read.  However, his panache is backed up with thorough, step-by-step instructions to reproduce his jaw-dropping results.    Whether or not his experiments can be replicated successfully in others has yet to be seen.  If so, consider it a bonus.   Tim's original, mischievous, and hilarious stories make this book worth the entertainment value alone.
030746363X|5.0|Some people are just haters, but, I have nothing but praise.  Is the book perfect?  Of course not.  It IS, however, an elegantly presented body of work that in many cases serves as a logical framework, or, jumping off point where you can then move forward yourself.<br /><br />I've done some of the things that he suggests, and haven't done others, and since much of this is based on his experimentation on himself, you have to recognize that there will be variance in your results, but, as far as a starting point, this book is really the companion book to 4HWW.<br /><br />Read it with an open mind, and make your own decisions.  I would bet that you will find more than 90% of the book immediately useful, and the other 10% will end up being something that you keep in the back of your mind.<br /><br />All that being said, even if you only read the Orgasm chapter, it is worth the price...I mean, isn't that worth learning?<br /><br />2 Things you'll do as an Adult on a regular basis, 1-Cook, so, you'll learn about that, good, and 2-(well, hopefully it is regular) have Sex, so, if you're going to do those 2 things, often, why not arm yourself with the most information you can get?<br /><br />I've read the 4HWW and implemented most of what he suggests, and that has led me on a very interesting path.<br /><br />The 4HB will do the same.  I may not follow everything to the letter, but, the book is Mind-Expanding, People, Not the Bible.
030746363X|4.0|While Tim Ferriss' new book reads more like a journal of all the crazy things he's done to himself, it is, for those who are truly interested in what the human body is capable of - and what it can withstand if the desire is great enough. He has conveniently separated the book into goal-oriented segments, so one does not need to read the book from cover to cover in the interest of getting to the part that they really want to read.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I am continuing to enjoy the book, as well as Tim's conversational writing style.<br /><br />Buy it.<br /><br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go take an ice bath.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|I bought \\"Lungs\\" by Florence + the Machine on the recommendation of my 16-year-old son, who also listens to a lot of music.  I am very grateful for recommendation, because I really love this CD, especially the first song, \\"Dog Days are Over,\\" which starts off very softly and sweetly and ends with a bang.  For me, the two focal points for most of the songs are the frequently thundering drum beats and Florence's powerful, soaring vocals.  While several of the songs feature loud, twangy guitars (i.e., \\"Kiss With A Fist\\" and \\"Girl With One Eye\\"), the majority of them have lush string arrangements.  I enjoyed the \\"in your face attitude,\\" which often is celebrated, on many of the songs.  This CD has Indie written all over it--highly recommended.
0525423273|4.0|I have been seeing this book mentioned every where and I think almost every review has given it 4 or 5 stars out of 5 stars.  So of course I had to pick it up but did so with some reservations.  It seems like it never fails that books that other people love fall flat for me, perhaps due to all the hype raising my expectations.  Fortunately this did not happen with this book.  I gobbled up the story and could not wait to finish it to see just how the happy ending we all know is coming will pan out.  Anna is pretty self-involved and has a habit of thinking the world revolves around her but I still enjoyed watching her experiences in France and the budding relationship with Etienne.  Etienne on the other hand is the most lovable character you could meet.  He's charming, handsome, sweet and has that one flaw of being short for a guy that keeps him from being irritatingly perfect.  The only thing I have to say was strange was I had to keep reminding myself that these were all high school kids.  They all come across as older and I would sometimes slip into the mind set that they were college seniors instead of high school seniors.  Still a wonderful romance story that you should definitely pick up.
B004259BMM|5.0|All but one of Keith's guitars were ruined in the Nashville flood. Supposedly the one that didn't was either a uke or a tenor guitar, so he had to start anew with borrowed or newly bought instruments.  When one is a guitar virtuoso like Keith and relies on certain \\"comfortable\\" guitars (20 or so) it tends to limit one's sound.  Having to pick up other instruments like Martin, Taylor and other high end guitars (many customized or one-offs) helped him break out of the old sound. Discerning listeners will hear a distinct difference, even though production contains many of the same players, engineers and producers. As strong as his previous three releases other than that, I rate all his recent releases 5 stars.
0735619670|5.0|this is best ever book on programming. A must read for any programmer.<br />Talks about the design and programming philosophies.
030746363X|5.0|If you liked four hour work week then this is going to be your style. A great collection on interesting and useful items about your body, with good writing and the links to extra data to learn more yourself. Well worth the money.
0446560065|5.0|I enjoyed his humor very much, there were one or two cartoons I didn't understand though.  I love how he draws simon, so real kitty-like.  I am looking forward to his next book.

B0047WJ12K|2.0|Well i am a 54 year old male.  I've seen lots of movies.  I just watched this Inception movie but it is kind of hard to understand.  It is weird in fact.  All shooter upper and no sense.  It tries to be like the matrix, but its not.  It is way more crazy and senseless. Various levels of dreams and dreamscapes, people flying everywhere,and everyone killing someone.  Good special effects at times, but all in all, a big waste.  Trying to make sense out of dreams which is senseless and pointless in this movie. I paid 3.99 to rent it ok, you got me.  But I did not watch it all at one time.  I had to pause a day because it got so stupid and i needed a break from this action scene after scene with the same boring actions and sound track.  I will not watch this movie again and i don't recommend it unless you want a big headache.  If this is the directors mind, then he should be seeing a psychiatrist.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This album is amazingly haunting and like nothing you've ever heard before! I'm always on the hunt for new and different music and there's really no other album lately that comes close to this. It's so intricately layered and rich. With every listen, new sounds and lyrics emerge... it's a revelation. I find that it has a way of sneaking up on you that is surprising and addicting. It seeps into even the quietest moments in my day and replays in my head... Brilliant!
B0009HLDFU|3.0|I dont blame people being pissed off that you cant rip the tracks onto your PC(dont dare even placing it near my computer) because of the anti-copying software that Sony put on it that will supposedly let in virus' and wreck your 'puter.Personally,I dont like this double CD too much of the FOO's because it just doesnt seem up to their standards. All their previous albums have been far superior to this. Glad I bought it used CHEAP.
B001LQQJ3E|4.0|I am not going to go through what's on the disks - others have done that already.  I would, however like to mention that when my set arrived it was missing disk 22, and had 2 copies of disk 23!  I contacted Mill Creek customer support through email, and found them very helpful.  Within a couple of days I had a copy of disk 22 posted to me, and I now have a complete set.<br /><br />Thankyou Mill Creek for excellent products, and excellent service.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Just like on PBS, only in one sitting. A great parody of Pride and Prejudice. Anyone enjoying Jane Austen should get a big kick out of this movie.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|One thing that I really appreciate about this CD is that it has some great info about the artists and songs that I didn't know and have wondered about. \\"Sweet Baby James\\" is written about JT's nephew, I never knew. There are other tidbits as well. Thanks Carole and James. xoxoxox I have yet to view the DVD it is probably equally fantastic.
0312370849|5.0|When I read a book that touches me, as this one did, I keep it forever. The key makes you cry, it makes you laugh. It inspires, & makes you sad. Hats off to De Rosney.
B003102JDM|2.0|I watched this without hearing about it first.  I'm a huge Coen brothers fan, from the very beginning of their career.  I want to give this 1 star because it had no real plot, filled with random unrelated events and characters that were half introduced then dropped like an unconvincing T-ranny at the first sight/sound of a police siren.  Seriously the characters were barely introduced, and none were well rounded, except the lead, which was barely a rounded character.  The reason that I'm not giving this a 1 star is that I guess this is made for 9th English class, in some kind of silly allegory way.  I love movies with a subtext, but they should still be movies that can stand on their own first, then have another layer built in.  If I had known I wouldn't have watched it, or at least I wouldn't have finished it hoping for ANY kind of resolution at the end.  I'm fine with movies with an interpretive ending, but that would require a beginning and a middle of the movie that was remotely interesting and engaging.  This had none of these attributes.  If I were in the mood to watch an un-movie (\\"film\\" that takes itself way, way too seriously and is ultimately not about anything other than stuff happening and the audience trying to justify why they didn't stop watching it) I would love this un-movie.  This was not thought provoking, it was not intriguing, I honestly don't consider it a movie, but more of a well-made student film project.      I want to watch blood simple again to get the taste out of my mouth.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|First of all my wife and I go nearly every year to see our local Guthrie theater's production of 'A Christmas Carol' so we've seen many interpertations of Charles Dicken's story.  I'm not going to go into great detail reviewing the film, but Disney sticks to the classic retelling and make no mistake, Jim Carrey is an excellent Scrooge, I loved his accent and he wasn't the wacky Pet Detective...  It's a top notch movie production from start to end.  If I had to nit-pick I'd say the chase scene during the ghost of Christmas future was a bit overdone, but it's a minor nusance as this is one of the best movie-versions of Dicken's story and in glorious 3D, the closest you'll get to going to an actual theatrical production with live actors.<br /><br />The 1080p 3D was simply outstanding on our Samsung Plasma display.  Incredible depth and detail.  Blows the doors off of the newest 3D version of Polar Express.<br /><br />Disney is way ahead of the curve here and I seek their products out whenever possible.  Here they have included FIVE versions of the film.  3D-BRD, 2D-BRD, DVD, Digital Copy, AND..streaming!  By putting the Disney Rewards Code into your Disney website membership, you unlock streaming of the film from the Disney website.  I tested this at home and at my office it works great with excellent quality.
0810988232|5.0|This is a beautiful deck by Brian Froud. I like how there are no words on the card, just a number you can look up in the LWB. This allows the reader to make their own interpretations. Also, the book is wonderful. There is a wealth of information in there. Overall, I love this deck, and pull from it daily.
B00447G29S|5.0|My  6 year-old son is a HUGE train lover.  The Polar Express is one of his favorite movies of all time.  We owned a toddler version of the book, we own the actual book, we own the DVD, the 3D version of the DVD, and now the Blu Ray 3D version.  Blu Ray 3D blows them all away.<br /><br />The story, about a boy struggling to believe in Santa, is a wonderful journey to the North Pole.  Seeing it in real 3D for the first time was like actually BEING on the train!  I gasped when the train pulled up to the house, it was that incredible (and this from someone who has seen the film dozens of times!)<br /><br />Since Amazon seems to aggregate all reviews under each version, if you own a 3d capable blu ray player and television, please look for the version that says Single Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo.  There is another \\"3D\\" version of the film that comes with the old school blue and red glasses - this is NOT what you want.  Trust.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|I would recommend this game.  It has very good graphics.  My son plays it all the time!  He loves the \\"coaster cam\\", and plays it for me whenever he builds a new ride.      The only complaint is that it takes about five minutes to load it each time you play, and about five minutes for it to shut down off the pc.
B002ZG9846|5.0|My order got screwed up.  I was sent a single disk version instead of a three disk version.  My money was refunded and I got to keep the single disk version I received.  Can't argue that kind of treatment.
B000E97HIA|1.0|i am a huge Prince fan. while i realize he has not really had any big hits his last few albums, i nonetheless wanted to give his more recent cd's a try. and i am also a completist- if i like an artist, i try to get everything they have done. i listened to this one twice after getting it, and i gave it away the next day. there was really no songs on this that had any spark. nothing was all that memorable to me. based on some people who gave this really good reviews, i had expected much better. i'd say a much better more recent release by him would be \\"rave Unto The Joy Fantastic\\". Prince seems to have lost his edge, but i still love him and am waiting for him to re-invent himself. this one is for purists only.
030746363X|5.0|I heard of Timothy Ferris initially on a twitter update from Scott Jurek.  I've raced with Scott on a number of occasions and respect him profoundly.  Subsequently i searched Timothy Ferris online and ironically, The 4-Hour Body, was set to release 72 hours later.  I purchased my copy on Amazon on Tuesday and since it arrived have been simply engrossed in the content.  I love being a human guinea pig as an endurance athlete and it's this love that has drawn me to the book... enjoy!
0446195529|3.0|Many readers enjoy escapist action thrillers as relaxing entertainment that demands the use of a small number of brain cells. David Baldacci fills that niche with most of his novels, and the latest Camel Club novel, Hell's Corner, provides enough surprises and plot twists to entertain, but not enough insight to require thought. Protagonist John Carr finds himself in a new set of implausible situations, and with the support of others, performs the impossible more than once. Readers will find this to be quick and easy reading, and a book that provides entertainment without straining the mind.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
0156528207|5.0|The Little Prince encompasses many adult themes.  One aspect of the novella stands out in my mind.  The division between the adult and child'd world is clearly the level of innocence.  It is a concept demonstrated throughout the book.    The narrator is a pilot that has crashed in the desert.  Despite an apparent lack of artistic talent, the Little Prince arrives and begins asking the narrator to draw different things.  After catering to the Little Prince's wishes, the travels start.  From this point, the home planet of the Little Prince is introduced as well as many other planets that exhibit adult malfuncitons.  In the final stop, the Little Prince visits Earth.  Like the other planets the author seems to make little sense of life on Earth.  It is also at this point that the Little Prince leaves the narrator as his crashed plane is repaired and a new level of understanding is achieved by the narrator.    Many of the themes in the book will not be understood by the grade level it is marketed toward.  Adults can find satisfaction in the innocence of the story and the mockery of adult life.  It is important to note that this book can be more than a strange fairy tale.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|Avatar curse is upon whole world now in form of Tron .its  Blue all over again but this movie is not great for its visuals but for exploring a loving relationship between father and son .I felt like watching finding Nemo in reverse (This movie is also PG not PG13 ) as here its son trying to save dad.Team behind Tron tried so hard to stick to original movie that they ignored to introduce anything new for this version .Almost 80% action sequence in movie are exact replica of original but of course high tech and big budget.so its like 1982 Tron in 3D with zero Creativity.All close Fight sequences were boring actors just throwing shields.They could `ve introduced some new high tech toys .Sam character was left unexplored in real world .Sound track is awesome but weak 3D unable to immerse \\"user \\"in the whole experience .So far only movie that really I want to play on my samsung 3D (regardless of story/acting) is \\"Resident evil after life\\"
B001UV4XFG|5.0|The action in the movie is great,however there are several cheesy moments with edward, bella, and jacob.  Yet this is overall really good and follows the book pretty closely!
030746363X|5.0|While some of the info isn't new, this book is a pretty good compendium of various disciplines and rolled together. For the price, its hard to beat. by using one basic method out of this book (its also on his website), I was able to add an inch to my biceps in a month. Much of the material flies in the face of conventional wisdom. I found the book hard to put down.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|Most of these songs appear on other albums by other artist previously released. I bought this because it was a great way for me to have these songs on one disc. Especially since some of the duets are with artists I would not normally buy. In all its a great CD for a Norah Jones fan like myself
0061733199|4.0|Like another reviewer said, this book does need some editing.  Aside from that, there's not much to complain about.  I've read this book almost front-to-back at least once, with plenty of re-reading about the important parts like creating your kit and identifying food (I've used the guide already to pick mushrooms, although I would prefer having a specialized book in identifying food, considering how risky it can be).                I'd have to say I'm very pleased with the book and would buy it again if I had to, although I think I will supplement this book with a food guide, because you should never rely on a single object or source of information for everything, even if said object or source is outstanding.         Plenty of other reviews have mentioned the contents, but if anyone wants to know if it contains a particular area that isn't mentioned, just comment and I'll get back to you.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|can anyone tell me if the prices and stuff is basically the same as regular monopoly or if everything is different?
B0034GK7DM|5.0|Easton Corbin is refreshing.  Older sounding country, not like the pop stlye we hear from everyone else.  Very nice.
B00192IV9U|5.0|It's hard to write a review when you love something so much. I have listened to this CD since it came out the 14th and each time it is better and better. Each layer, bit by bit I can appreciate how Michael worked these songs. Thank You Michael! We miss you so much.<br />To those that have negative reviews, please provide proof of your claims.<br />I have listened to Michael since J5.<br />Is an artist not allowed to grow? Must we all be brainwashed into thinking he should sound exactly like he did 15 years ago? I don't think so! So don't push your unfounded views on those that want to hear the album, let us make up our own minds. Michael never stopped creating, Michael never stopped growing as an artist. Give him some space to breath and for us to enjoy what he has given us.<br />Long Live The King of Pop!!
B003F3NDOO|5.0|We are totally hooked on this show. My husband and I both like it. We crack up when we are watching it and usually watch 4-5 episodes at a time. The jokes are funny and the story keeps you interested and wanting more. The actors work so well together. I wish we lived by these people, I would love to drink wine with them at 8 am! We are Scrubs lovers and this has the same humor. Give it a chance and you will love it too!
0316098337|5.0|Agree with some others -- read as little about this book as you can, but do read it. Just know that it is harrowing, emotional, and incredibly rewarding to experience the story evolve from the perspective of 5-yr-old Jack. JackerJack.<br /><br />Some are complaining about it being told from the little boy's point of view, but believe me, it takes the edge off. With Jack, hope never dies. Even the way the author shows a mother's endless capacity to love her son makes this book worth it. I won't soon forget it.
030746363X|5.0|This book is not a typical fitness/health book read.  It is broken up into segments for different goals in mind.  Not all of it will be totally applicable to each reader, but the content that is appropriate for his or her body type and goals is very powerful.    After reading about half the book, I am definitely going to be buying copies for a few friends who would appreciate the help with their fitness.  The book is about debunking false knowledge about fitness and the body so not everyone will agree with it.
B00197X140|5.0|I have watched Anathema performing live an acoustic show containing most of these songs. I can say that listening to this CD gave me pretty much the same feeling of relaxation and katharsis. If you like Anathema this is a must buy item and if you don't know Anathema it's a nice way to get introduced to their amazing music.

0394873742|5.0|We never would have purchased this on our own but after our cousin saw him reading it at our local bookstore, she purchased it for him.  That was over four months ago and he still loves it!  I think he looks at it every day.  The only problem is that he wants us to read it to him over and over again.  If we had to give all his things away and could hold on to only one item, this would be it.
6305841861|5.0|If you're looking for a move that will make you laugh, scream and go WTF all it the same time, look no further Evil Dead 2 two is a B-movie classic.  A rehashing of Sam Raimi's film school project (the original evil dead), this movie has a slightly bigger budget, but realizes part of the draw of the original was the casts over-the-top acting and apparently unintentional over all cheesiness.  From the get-go, you know, Ash is a bit of a schmuck, but a lovable one.   Bruce Campbell's cheesy over-the-top acting kicks him from the word go.  I honestly can't think of another actor brings as much goofy charm to any character.  From the moment Ash finds the professors recording warning of evil lurking in the woods, things began to rapidly deteriorate for our hero.  First, his girlfriend is possessed and comes back to life and attempts to kill him until he chops her head off with a shovel only to have her reanimted corpse pop-up from her shallow grave and dance gracefully off into the night.  At one point he falls asleep in a rocking chair, only to wake him and have her head drop into his lap and bite his hand.  Soon after his hand becomes possessed forcing in the lop it off at the wrist.  If you pay close enough attention you noticed the bookie places on top of the jar containing his hand is \\"A farewell to arms\\".  It's little things like this and the entire casts commitment to overacting each of their parts that make this so enjoyable.  This creates more moments of bust your gut laughter than most mainstream comedy films ever achieve.  It's dark, it's funny, and it never gets old.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Okay, now this is a comic book superhero movie done right.  While I've had issues with Marvel movies in the past,his time they hit the nail on the head.  This movie is based off the ultimate universe version of Ironman.  The casting of Robert Downey Junior as Tony Stark was an excellent choice, considering his own troubled past with alcohol and drugs.  He portrayed Tony's playboy image excellently.  The custome design on the suit is also spot on.  Gwyneth Paltrow is great as the feisty personal assistant Pepper Potts.  It's a shame they didn't keep Terrence Howard around in the role of James Rhodes for the second movie.  The action scenes were intense and everything you'd expect out of a comic book based property.  You can tell the director and cast had a lot of fun as it shows in the on screen chemistry.  They do just enough fan service for those who were familiar with the source material without bogging it down for those unfamiliar with the comic books.  This is a good, fun time and a definite must-see.  Hopefully they can carry the moment of this on throughout the series

Tim has provided the simplest approaches to body transformation that I have ever read. The chapters discussing the slow-carb diet are great.

0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larsson's \\"Millenium\\" trilogy is a great read overall, but it's really the first book (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\") that shines the most. The protagonists are as unique as they are believable AND likable. The tale of Lisbeth Salander, the torn and abused computer genius and Michael Blomquist, the investigate reporter with a knack for his married co-editor draws the reader's attention like few thrillers do. Larsson's style and language are fresh and refreshingly free of schmaltzy emotion. To me, this is the sort of book that will still be great the umpteenth time you read it.
B001F1YBP8|5.0|Enjoying this masterpiece over a lifetime, I never expected the added joys this exceptional Blu-Ray edition delivers. In addition to showing off the amazing video and audio resolution of the Blu-Ray format, the presentation is unique. The players stand, which allows us to see full body language unconstrained by being seated. The players move together, creating a visual flow of its own. Some players emphasize their lines like a batter leaning into a fastball. Everyone has a chance to shine, and the camera misses nothing. The cameras follow the musical lines so perfectly that I hear (by seeing) voices in the ensemble that I may have missed before. This is a perfect blend of individuals and ensemble, and Abbado shows what conducting is all about with his economical style. Experiencing Bach in this way--with the exceptional visual element--adds a dimension to hearing these works that I really can't believe.

B000AGTPUK|4.0|When I first saw this film in a theater, I wasn't sure I liked it.  The CGI was incredible, especially the hair of the various characters and the textures of the fabrics--Santa's bag was an incredible and very real velvet.  Yet the thought of small children being \\"picked up\\" by someone, without the knowledge and consent of their parents seemed a little creepy, despite the unlikely presence of a train in their front yard, and not the best model for behavior.  With exposure, however, the film takes on more of the aspects of a roller coaster ride and while exciting is not quite so creepy.  Even the ghost becomes less threatening with time.  I would suggest, however, that parents discuss the dangerous issue of going with anyone unknown to them for any reason whatsoever with their children after the film.<br /><br />The color and quality of the film are incredible.  Almost anything that can be done with a computer seems to have been done here.  The lifelike quality of movements was exceptional; my favorites were the sudden and very purposeful movements of the animals:  wolves, a herd of elk, an eagle and Santa's reindeer.  The movements of hair and clothing were also wonderful.  The eyes of the various characters, however, seemed a little too staring and gave the faces a wooden aspect, so this is still in the realm of the sophisticated cartoon. The real character of specific objects was also very varied.  Without knowledge of context, the sleigh bell in the final scene would be almost indistinguishable from a real bell.  Yet much of the train and other items were business-as-usual cartoons.  Similarly, while some people were almost hyper-real, others were simpler cartoon characters.  Contrast with the conductor, who looks very much like Tom Hanks, and the engineer and coal stoker, who were totally Saturday-morning cartoons, was at times a little jarring.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the fact that so many of the parts were played by Tom Hanks.  While he is undoubtedly a gifted actor, it seemed that there might have been greater dramatic variety if the interpretations of the different characters had arisen from seperate individuals.  The children's roles were wonderful; and their singing voices exceptional.<br /><br />The most incredible and exciting scenes--and certainly those that illustrated the great potential of computer generated virtual reality--were the roller coaster-like trips down steep inclines on the train and the slipping sliding trip across the lake of ice.  One had the same sensations from viewing the film as one might have had actually undergoing the real experience.  I was totally impressed.<br /><br />The story is a perennial one, the loss of belief in \\"magic\\" by the young.  Though simple, almost everyone has been there in their time.  One almost might say that the whole story was based on the adult wish to prolong their own children's belief for a little longer--perhaps even their own, at least for the duration of the film.  Altogether, the exciting adventures, the comraderie of new friends, and the wonderful message of belief in the spirit of the holiday made the film a great success for me.ifted actor, it seemed that there might have been greater dramatic variety if the interpretations of the different characters had arisen from seperate individuals.

Altogether, the exciting adventures, the comraderie of new friends, and the wonderful message of belief in the spirit of the holiday made the film a great success for me.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This collection bears the stamp of Loreena McKennit, that's for sure.  The feeling I get is one of gratitude, and of appreciation for one's roots.  Beautifully Celtic!  She does a fine job of promoting and exhibiting the culture without sounding as though it was all a lecture on history.  I especially admire the way she manages to bring old songs to life and make them sound like new.  No doubt the original composers would have bought this CD, too, had they had them at the time.
030745455X|2.0|I don't think it's a bad book. It's good in the beginning and in the end. The middle of the book is filled with too much detail which gets boring after a while. The story line is good and the only reason I stuck it out was to find out what happens in the end. I don't understand what all the hype is about.
1416550518|1.0|I love mysteries and gothic novels.  The era represented in this book can lead to extremely absorbing plots.  This book does not have that.  It's characters are not compelling and it was a struggle to get to page 99, where I put it on my \\"burn\\" pile of books which do not deserve to be read, nor lent to anyone who has read a truly good novel in their lives.    Nice Typing.  That's about it.
0345404475|5.0|These days I imagine that most people, like myself, read \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" after having seen and enjoyed the movie \\"Blade Runner\\".  In my case \\"Blade Runner\\" is one of my all-time top ten favorite movies, for a variety of reasons: the questions it raises about what is human and what is not; the love story and the conflict it creates between a man's feelings and his occupation; the futuristic film noir settings and acting; and the contrast between the rich and powerful and the degraded denizens of the street. \\"Blade Runner\\" is one of the few movies I own on DVD or Blu-ray, since there are few movies that I want to see more than once.  Recently, after introducing one of my kids to \\"Blade Runner\\", I decided that we should both read the book that it is based upon.  We each thoroughly enjoyed \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\", but for slightly different reasons than the movie \\"Blade Runner\\".    Contrasting first the book with the movie: it turns out that the movie follows the book fairly closely for about the first third of the book (minus one character, as Rick Deckard is married in the book), but then the plot of the movie departs fairly significantly from the book.  One of the enjoyable aspects of reading \\"Do Androids Dream...\\" as a Blade Runner fan is seeing the choices that the moviemakers made to come up with a compelling two hour movie.  They basically redid the plot to make the major conflict in the movie one between the Nexus-6 androids and the head of the corporation that made them, and they also made the romance between Rick Deckard and the android Rachel into the second major plot element of the movie.  Philip K. Dick died in 1982, the same year that \\"Blade Runner\\" had its first theatrical release, so I don't believe there is any way to know what Dick thought of the movie.  I think that the choices made to create \\"Blade Runner\\" were the right ones to make a great movie, even though there were unfaithful to the book.  The movie and bookare separate works with similar themes, and can be appreciated on their own.    The main theme of \\"Do Androids Dream...\\" is the same as \\"Blade Runner\\"; what does it mean to be human, and how should humans and artificial humanoid lifeforms treat each other, especially in cases where the humanoids come in peace and want nothing more than to be treated the same as humans and left alone.  Although this specific situation can only come about in the future, if artificial intelligence and life science technology progress far enough, the situation has parallels that are nearly as old as mankind: the conflicts that come about when two civilizations, races, ethnicities or tribes meet and start to intermingle.  Should the groups be kept entirely separate under penalty of death?  One of the Nexus-6 androids in \\"Do Androids Dream...\\" is a renowned opera singer - should she be terminated simply because she is an android impersonating a human?    The post-nuclear-war world that Philip K. Dick portrays in \\"Do Androids Dream...\\" is even bleaker than the landscapes in \\"Blade Runner\\".  Animal species have become extinct and animals have died off in such large numbers that people's greatest status symbol possession is their pet - and of course a real animal pet is far superior to an artificial one.  People's minds are degenerating because of the nuclear fallout, and the move off-planet is not one of lifestyle choice but of survival, for those smart enough to make it. People squat in abandoned buildings and move from place to place to try to minimize the nuclear fallout,  In the book Philip K. Dick is able to explore these sub-topics and others that are barely alluded to in the movie.    The primary (albeit minor) problem I had with \\"Do Androids Dream...\\" were a couple of logical inconsistencies in the plot.  If the world and makind are as damaged as Dick describes them, then would there be enough of civilization left to still support opera performances?  Why would the androids want tocome to Earth? In all science fiction there is some disbelief that the reader has to suspend.  I also felt that some people could easily interpret \\"Do Androids Dream...\\" as being misogynist, since the female characters are for the most part pitifully weak, whereas most of the action is taken by men.    That said, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" should be a must read for anyone who enjoyed \\"Blade Runner\\".  The parallels between the two works are fun to uncover.  Each work poses deep questions about humanity and makes a major impact on the audience, which are two important criteria for earning the accolade \\"masterpiece\\".
B002JVWR9U|3.0|It arrived on the day I wanted it to, but the first disc skipped quite a bit. Some parts I couldn't even watch at all. Other than that, it worked just fine.
B0044X5EZ0|5.0|I can't give an objective review about this album cause I just love Jamiroquai's music. If you are a fan, you'll really enjoy it. He haven't lost his unique style and the bonus tracks are a great plus. Besides, it came with the lyrics, so you can sing out loud and enjoy!
B003FHPVG8|5.0|This book is an amazing read.  Unlike the movie, the book leaves the ending to one's imagination.  The story takes place in the 1950s and is about Landon Carter, a teen rebel, and Jaimie Sullivan, the preacher's good and sweet daughter.  Despite their differences, they fall in love and marry.

B0041KKYEW|5.0|\\"Black Swan\\" is a fantastic psychological thriller that chronicles one determined ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman), as she rises to the top of her craft, landing the roles of the White Swan and the Black Swan in her company's production of \\"Swan Lake.\\" Nina has a hard time letting loose and finding the passion needed to portray the Black Swan. The stress of the production leads her to experience physical ailments, engage in wicked banter with her mother (Barbara Hershey), and become paranoid about a perceived rivalry with a new dancer (Mila Kunis). This is a terrifying movie, far scarier than most horror movies that have emerged in the last decade. Portman's performance is astonishing and all but guarantees her an Oscar nod. The final dance sequence in the film is unbelievable, and I literally got chills at the end of the movie, which never happens. Definitely splurge to see \\"Black Swan\\" in the theatre...it's destined to become a classic.
B003JTHETY|5.0|I've got a agree with earlier reviews on the sites, this album takes multiple listens to truly appreciate.  It is by far the most progressive work Maiden has done in years.  If you're looking for the straight up of metal on fear of the dark,or number of the beast, you're probably not going be happy with this offering.  The producer, Kevin Shirley, seems to have given the band a free hand to indulge their most progressive tendencies.  For those who've heard Dream Theater's covers of various Maiden albums you'll know what I'm talking about.  That being said, Bruce's vocals are vastly superior to anything on any of the DT albums.  The guitar work is top notch and intricately laid out.  Coming home and where the wild wind blows are tracks that, when played live, are sure to get the crowds lighters out.  So yes, it could be considered progressive and indulgent but after 30 some years I believe the band has earned the right to indulge their inner music geeks, and for those fans willing to sit through multiple listens you will be rewarded with the band you love showing you how much they love music, and their craft.  Even all these years later, they're not phoning it in like some bands have and resting on their laurels.  If this truly is the groups swansong it's a hell of a way to go out.  As far as the extras on the steel book go, color me underwhelmed.  No bonus disc, the pictures aren't anything you couldn't find on fan sites, as they're mostly pictures of the band in concert.  That being said, the albums a must buy, but don't spring for the steel book.  The albums a hard five but the limited edition only gets a four due to subpar bonus content.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|Norah's new album, actually a collection of old things I guess, works pretty good. This is only the 2nd album of hers I felt compelled to buy, the first being of course her seminal debut, Come Away With Me. Her voice and harmonies with some of music's innovators is not to be missed. The tracks flow from blues, pop, and belting ballads, to some funk and back. It all blends out for a good time. I'm tempted to buy the vinyl.
030746363X|4.0|From reading all the reviews, regular folks who were looking for a concise guide to fitness love this book, while fitness nerds are calling foul and hate the book.  Some of the stuff is over the top, but it has plenty of actionable information that someone who is too busy to read \\"latest medpub articles\\" can use.    It is important to notice that most of the information is divided into basic and advanced.  The basic stuff is what most people will find useful.  Of that all of the fitness nerd reviews I read say, \\"I already knew that, bummer...\\".  I have yet to run into one that says it's wrong.  For the advanced and the orgasm chapter, there seems to be a lot of controversy.    What did you expect?  Like 4-hour work week, most of that stuff was already said in Peopleware and Rich Dad, Poor Dad.  And probably someone said it before that.    Bottom line for me: is it concise, is it fun to read, is it actionable?  Most certainly.
B002ZG9774|5.0|The movie was great from start to finish.Yeah the story was a bit weak but its a musical 1st and for most.The musical Numbers were top notch,Christina Aguilera did a great performance.Who would of known that she is a good actress as she is a great singer.All around the movie was great fun.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Pure fun and joy! This film turned out exactly the way I dreamed that it would ( for me anyhow ). Granted there is a lot to take in when seeing this film, ingest so to speak. But it works. And for those of us who grew up with the original Tron, this will really make you feel and miss those good ol' days when there were killer arcades and simpler times. As complex as the movie can be and feel at times ( which is where I can actually relate and agree to some of the negative reviews out there about the plot/ story ) it does work. What I ultimately took from the story that touched me the most was the bond between father and son. The movie works and hits on every aspect. Mind blowing FX and CGI, outstanding stunts and coreography, an insane soundtrack and music that actually inhances the movie experience ( which is something I have not felt with a film in a long time ), and IMOP a very touching and human story about the strive for perfection in all of us as a whole society, along with the above mentioned father/ son thing. In a nut shell: This film is an ode to all that still have that inner child inside and will always be forever young. Hopefully it will touch a younger, new generation as well. Enjoy!
B003ZD9DTI|4.0|Let's go back....way,way back.Back before the Jew-hating rants,the philandering,the ugly divorce and the numerous drunk driving charges.Back before the ugly ticking time bomb that star Mel Gibson has become now.Mad Max is Mel Gibson in his acting infancy and while it is very difficult at times to separate the actor and his career from the films,separate we must.<br />Trained in the more traditional classical style of stage acting(Shakespeare,etc)Gibson had debuted in films in just one role in /77 in Australia when he was offered the title role in Mad Max shortly after.Continuing working on the stage before,during and after shooting Max,Gibson,like everyone involved with the film including writer/director George Miller,were gobsmacked at the films impact.For just around a cool $1/2 million dollars,Millers' independent film company produced what would become an extremely profitable product way beyond their expectations.In fact it has pulled in to date over a $100,000,000! Gibson's career slowly lifted off the runway of mere acting mortals as he would go on to star in Gallipoli,The Year of Living Dangerously,the two sequels to Mad Max and then onto his Lethal Weapon series.And Gibson hasn't seen ground since,although some say his recent \\"problems\\" have crash landed him unceremoniously back to terra firma permanently.We shall see.<br />Mad Max's premise may be a simple one but it has a certain je nais sais quoi,that draws you into the story and keeps you watching.Set in a future which is decidedly bleak(\\"dystopian\\" being the word often used),the film opens with an escaping convict and cop-killer called Night Rider,that is being doggedly pursued by the constabulary,this being the MFP(Main Force Patrol).Two MFP cars  can't get the job done so it is up to their leather clad top pursuit man Max to get their man.And get him he does which ends with the convicts death in a fiery crash.<br />The scene switches to a motorcycle gang which the now deceased Nightrider was a member of.The body of their former comrade is at a train station in a small town,which they are there to collect.However a young couple watching some of the mayhem some of the gang members are unleashing decide to make a run for it in their car.The gang's boss man Toecutter(played delicously by Hugh Keays Burn)sees them and order all bodies to hunt them down.They easily overwhelm the couple and one member decides to stay behind and have some fun with the female of the two.He is caught later at the scene by Max and his partner Jim,alias The Goose(Steve Bisley)and taken to be arraigned on charges.No sooner have they got their man than they have to let him go;no one turns out as a witness.<br />The gang has a long memory and they eventually take out The Goose while he is trapped upside down in his vehicle as the result of a crash.Max is beside himself and he decides to retire.He turns in his resignation but his boss tells him to take some time off and then come back to reconsider.This he does with his wife and baby who go on an extended car trip around the countryside.While getting a tire fixed his wife goes to a nearby store to get some ice cream but its molested by none other than Toe Cutter and his gang.She barely escapes and they flee the area.They end up at a relatives farm but the gang has followed them there.While coming back from the beach through some woods Max's wife is being chased and he hears her screams.She manages to reach Max who whisks her into the house while he goes in search of the perps.However they have done a runaround and are waiting at the farmhouse.Wifey flees but her car has been tampered with and as she runs away from her broken down vehicle,baby in arms,the motorcycle gang run her down in the middle of the road.Arriving at the scene too late Max is filled with rage.He returns home with one thing on his mind;vengeance.He re-suits up,gets an even more jacked-up pursuit car and heads out to get his pound of flesh.He dispatches the gang members firstin a group then he goes after the two important ones;Toecutter and the guy who killed his partner;in that order.Toecutter gets his kissing the front grill of a semi,while Max hand cuffs the other one to an overturned truck,dripping petrol.He rigs a little something up set to explode in a short time and gives him a hack saw.He tells him he can either cut through the hand cuffs in about ten minutes or saw his handcuffed ankle off,which should take about five(shades of \\"Saw\\"!).The last shot of the movie is from the front hood of the car looking back at Max and the scene behind as he drives away.Of course the inevitable explosion occurs with the audience yelling an in-tandem\\"Yesss!\\".But Max's face is not smiling;it's full of angst,pain and the memories of the past 24 hours as he drives off to......who knows where? Fade out.<br />As I mentioned before while this story may be simplistic at times,and while there are many moments that reveal its' low budget roots,this a movie you just cannot stop watching.Just when other lesser films would fade into some irrelevant love scene or other padding,this one has that hook that just won't let you walk away.You often wonder what is going to happen after such and such a moment and you may even KNOW what is going to happen,but it makes no difference.The film's rawness and punch always keeps itself on track.There are no apologies here and some of the more violent scenes are what they are because they BELONG there.<br />This DVD set comes packaged with the Blue Ray disc also.The Blue Ray is a single sided disc while the DVD version is a dreaded two-sided double disc,and is on the bottom holder of the two.One side contains the film,in TWO versions:widescreen(2:35:1) and full screen.The other side is devoted to features only.Specials include:commentary,a special Max Facts track,photo gallery,TV spots,original trailers and two featurettes,one on Gibson career and the other about the Mad Max phenomenon itself.The Blu Ray disc has only the film,commentary and the Mad max phenom featurette.<br />The film itself has restored Gibsons voice which was dubbed over in later versions and some cut footage.It now runs closer to 91 minutes than the previous 88.The transfer is beautiful and the print they use here is pristine.This is Mad Max they way it was always intended to be shown.<br />In short this career starting,adrenaline pumping Mel Gibson vehicle from /79 is a winner all the way.Sure it's an indie film and shows its' slip more times than not but its' compelling storyline will have you riveted to the screen from beginning to the end.As the first of three Mad Max films(a fourth is said to be in the works!),it is a must have.he goes after the two important ones;Toecutter and the guy who killed his partner;in that order.Toecutter gets his kissing the front grill of a semi,while Max hand cuffs the other one to an overturned truck,dripping petrol.He rigs a little something up set to explode in a short time and gives him a hack saw.He tells him he can either cut through the hand cuffs in about ten minutes or saw his handcuffed ankle off,which should take about five(shades of \\"Saw\\"!).The last shot of the movie is from the front hood of the car looking back at Max and the scene behind as he drives away.Of course the inevitable explosion occurs with the audience yelling an in-tandem\\"Yesss!\\".But Max's face is not smiling;it's full of angst,pain and the memories of the past 24 hours as he drives off to......who knows where?

B001GCUO5W|5.0|This is one those few movies where, even when you suspect the ending, it still blows you away. This movie is like a video capture of Edgar Allan Poe at his best.
B0000024UX|5.0|BOTW was the last studio record by the duo of Paul Simon (song writer, musician and singer) and Art Garfunkel (singer). The two had a successful 60's career as a folk music duo with four albums released along with several hit singles including `The Sounds of Silence', `I am a Rock', `Fakin It', and `Mrs Robinson'. But, it wasn't until the 1970 release of BOTW that Simon's songwriting and Garfunkel's epic singing on the title track along with `The Boxer' catapulted them from `folk duo' to major pop music stars. In addition to those songs were the hits `Cecilia' and `El Condor Pasa' the former being an up-tempo number about a captivating but unfaithful lover while the latter is a Peruvian folk song that Simon modified from the original. Those four songs alone are worth owning the album but `The Only Living Boy in New York' and `(So Long) Frank Lloyd Wright' make the record an absolute must-have. Paul Simon went on to have a very successful career as a solo artist but never could he write such sweeping songs as `Bridge Over Troubled Water' without a voice like Garfunkel's to bring them to life. As swan songs go, this one is just about perfect. A couple of less than stellar songs 'Why Don't You Write Me?' and a live version of the Everly Brother's 'Bye Bye Love' are the only weaker cuts here.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|not a bad movie.  Unusual premise, who'd ever think of making a movie of 3 people stuck on a ski lift 50 to 75ft in the air, on an empty slope.  if your afraid of heights this might move you to the edge of the couch.   I think the wolves were a bit much but you never know I guess.  definitly worth checking out.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|Roman Polanski stars in his own hilarious spoof on the vampire genre entitled THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS. The bumbling Professor Abronsius and his young assistant set off to the snow-capped mountains of Transylvania to stake out its toothy inhabitants, but the two find themselves outnumbered when they land in the middle of a grand vampire ball! Each of the cast members deliver a series of quirky performances, but while Jack MacGowran's confident fool of a professor earns many laughs with his physical gags, it is Polanski's subtle gesturing and soft-spoken humor that wins out in the end. With huge Gothic sets and creeping atmospherics, THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE HUNTERS rivals many of Hammer's best while creating its own dark mood despite the light tone. This can best be seen in the eerie finale, when the three heroes are discovered casting a reflection in the mirror while surrounded by a ballroom of undead dandies. The off humor and slow pacing may be limiting for many viewers, but Gothic film fans will find this Horror Comedy to be quite the delight.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B00005JKCH|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"Spider-Man\\" is an awesome 2002 superhero film from Sony Pictures and Marvel Entertainment.  Starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Defoe, and Kirsten Dunst it pops off of the screen with action and also harbors a thought-provoking storyline.<br /><br />Directed by Sam Raimi and based on the comic book created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, \\"Spider-Man\\" is mostly exceptional.  Following an obligatory origin story for both hero and villain(Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider, while Norman Osborne essentially poisons himself in an experiment), the movie focuses on the choices Spider-Man makes which define him as the hero from the villainous Green Goblin.  At the center of the story is the call to do the right thing morally when often a path of least resistance seems easier.  In Spider-Man's case, the character is a teenager with enormous power and responsibility thrust on him.  Tobey Maguire plays the emotional conflict well.  As Spider-Man makes a decision to stand for goodness, the Green Goblin, the psychological id of Norman Osborne, consumes him.  There is a genuine tragic quality to the Green Goblin, because the good Norman Osborne regards Peter Parker as nothing less than a son.  This rankles his actual son(and Peter's best friend) Harry, played by James Franco, but that's a story for two other movies to tell.<br /><br />As Mary Jane Watson, Kirsten Dunst is intriguing playing a goodhearted character with a hard home life.  Ms. Dunst has obvious talent and a palpable chemistry with her two young male co-stars.<br /><br />The biggest mistake this movie makes is in costuming.  It is still a mystery to me why they chose to put Willlem Defoe in a metallic green suit as the Goblin.  I prefer the famous naturalistic Goblin of comic books and animation, but it's possible the filmmakers deemed that look too controversial and demonic.<br /><br />Also starring Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris, \\"Spider-Man\\" is one of the best comic book adaptations of the modern era.
030746363X|5.0|I received my copy of 4-Hour Body the other day. I opened it rather breathlessly because - well I knew my swimming method, Total Immersion, would be featured. I was thrilled with what I read. Here are excerpts from the chapter \\"How I Learned to Swim Effortlessly in 10 Days\\"(pps. 434 to 443)    \\"Swimming had always scared the hell out of me. Despite national titles in other spots, I could barely keep afloat for 30 seconds. This inability to swim well was one of my greatest insecurities and embarrassments.  I'd tried to learn almost a dozen times and each time my heart jumped to 180+ beats per minutes after one or two pool lengths. It was indescribably exhausting and unpleasant.   No more. In a span of less than 10 days I went from a2-length (40 yard) maximum to swimming more than 40 lengths. From there I moved to swimming one to two miles in open ocean. The entire progression took less than two months.\\"     TIM EMBARKED ON THIS QUEST at the urging of a friend who told him that \\"unlike my other self-destructive habits masquerading as exercise, swimming was a life skill. Not only that it was a pleasure I needed to share with my future children. In other words, of all the potential skills you could learn, swimming was one of the most fundamental.\\"    TIM STARTED THE TRADITIONAL WAY - pulling and kicking, more and harder.     \\"Kick boards? Tried them. I barely moved and as someone who is good at most sports felt humiliated. \\"  \\"Hand paddles? Tried them. My shoulders will never forgive me. Isn't swimming supposed to be low impact? Strike two.\\"  \\"Then I met Chris Sacca of Google fame, now a triathlete in training, at a barbecue and told him of my plight. Befoe I had a chance to finish, he cut me off.  'I have the answer to your prayers. It revolutionized how I swim.'  That was the turning point.\\"    THE METHOD  \\"Chris introduced me to Total Immersion. I immediately ordered the book and freestyle DVD.   In the first workout, without a coach, I cut water resistance at least50% swimming more laps than ever before. By the fourth workout, I'd gone from 25+ strokes per 20-yard length to an average of 11 strokes.  I was covering more than twice the distance per stroke with half the effort and no panic or stress. In fact, I felt better after leaving the pool than when I got in. I couldn't and still can't believe it.\\"    HARD TO BELIEVE  \\"I never thought I'd say this but I love swimming.   This is RIDICULOUS. I've always HATED swimming. Now, whenever possible, I make time to do laps. It's like a moving meditation. I'll swim for two hours and sneak out later for another session. It's like moving meditation.\\"    WHAT ABOUT TIM'S GOAL TO SWIM A MILE IN THE OCEAN?  \\"One morning I woke up early and went to the ocean. I was calm despite the waves, and I stood on the damp sand at the edge of the whitewash looking out for a long time. Then I approached the lifeguard stand.   'How far away is that house.' I asked the lifeguard, pointing down the beach at a red rooftop.   'Almost exactly a mile.'  `Great. Thanks.'  With that I started walking, and 20 minutes later stopped in front of the red roof. I put on my goggles, took a few deep breaths and got in the water.  I swam parallel to the beach about 100 feet offshore. Alternating right and left breaths, I entered a Zen-like state of almost supernatural confidence. I reached the lifeguard stand and continued another 200 yards, when I decided to get out of the water. There was no fatigue or concern.  Walking up the sand I have never been prouder or felt more alive. One of my deepest-seated lifelong insecurities was gone and would never return. The elation was indescribable.  TI training is the first instruction that's made sense to me and is 100% responsible for the fastest transformation I've ever had in sports.    \\"Think it can't be that easy? Here are just two before-and-after responses from testers who used guidelines I provided on my web site:  From Rocky: \\"I tried TI and in 2 days have gone from 2laps to 25 laps. I was telling friends yesterday that in my entire adult life if I had to pick 3 things that have held me in awe, this would be among them.\\"  From Diego: \\"Just one month ago, I was fighting to stay afloat. I started learning Total Immersion. Last week I did a 1.5-mile swim in the pool. Today I made a 2.5-mile swim and only stopped because the facility was closing. I'm graduating to open water now. It's been a lifelong dream of mine to perform in the Ironman and my times now are already below the cutoff for the 2.4-mile swim.\\"
B002ZG99N6|4.0|This is a well-crafted movie based on Chuck Hogan's novel: Prince of Thieves, about bank robbers and the FBI men chasing them. Underneath, it is a character driven story, focusing on Ben Affleck's character. There is a LOVE story here, as well gritty action. It is NOT the movie HEAT, so stop the comparisons. There are a lot of movies about bank robbers, why is everyone picking HEAT to compare it too?

It clears up all those things you \\"think you know happend\\" including the Alamo, the bat, and the kid that killed himself while supposedly listening to suicide solution.  Short review: Buy this book, it's awesome.  RIP Randy Rhodes.
B004G6009K|5.0|I have 5 wonderful children. We are Disney Vacation Club members and my wife and I both grew up in Florida and are lifetime fans of all things Disney. We have had the joy of sharing the fun and excitement of annual Disney vacations, the daily fun of the Disney channel, but most of all the magic that is Disney animation. Pixar has had all the animation thunder and been carrying this torch for quite some time. However, that is no longer true. At a recent screening in our local multiplex, me and the kids sat down for an afternoon showing of Tangled. From the preview, we saw it as a movie we would see. We were all blown away. We had so much fun watching this movie, not just because it was a beautiful exquisitely timed and told story, but it was just flat out fun with no drag and a significant break from the \\"formula\\" of Disney animation. Not that the formula was bad, but this is something new that feels both fresh and current with the extra special \\"Magic\\" that only Disney can do. When I talked to the kids after watching this we all agreed, that for us this film was better than Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, The Princess and the Frog, Alladin and even better than the pixar films (just a small amount though). Disney blew this one completely out of the park!! I ordered the 3D blu ray right away and we cant wait to get it!!!
B001GCUNYO|1.0|Picked this up because I like Liam Neeson, but boy, this was poor.<br /><br />It starts off eerily similar to an early \\"24\\" episode (indeed, even the daughter's name is Kim) - This time, an ex-government agent's daughter is kidnapped, and dad uses his spy skills to rescue her and take the bad guys down.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it stayed in \\"24's\\" implausible mode, so I stuck with it for the yucks.<br /><br />Along with the bad dialog, some of my favorites:<br /><br />-Liam Neeson's anal guy character studying what looks like the actual, folded karaoke machine manual (no, not some hardcopy he printed off a website) before he buys the thing. Must be some type of spy skill.<br /><br />-Liam Neeson's character going to great lengths to acquire an Albanian interpreter, but check it out - virtually everyone in the film speaks better English than the interpreter.<br /><br />-All of the bad guys are out of the 1960's James Bond school of sterotypical villans, especially the fat letch shiek on the yacht.<br /><br />-Kim, of course, \\"the best for last\\", gets auctioned for a really, really high bid. Ha-ha. Dad's high bid. Ah, ha-ha-ha.<br /><br />-The guys on the letch sheik's yacht somehow know that it's Kim's dad that is after them (the dead guy that sold her to him must have taken the time to warn them before he was offed). Orders are to kill Liam Neeson's character -'if necessary'. Maybe he'll listen to reason?<br /><br />-The whole sappy bookend spiel about the rock singer girl - was waiting for evreryone to start singing \\"Kum Ba Yah\\" at the end...

B003NFM3JK|1.0|A sad, convoluted effort that leaves one cold. First, the animators seemed to not be able to decide if the characters were \\"realistic\\" or \\"cartoons.\\"  The result is that too many characters simply look deformed.  Second, just because they could do animated \\"fly-bys\\" impossible with live film, they beat the concept to death with too many shots that defy physics. But, worst of all, the film seems to have been infected with that subtle sense of meanness that is lurking around the edges of so many Jim Carey movies. And this is one instance where it simply doesn't work. The Christmas morning ending lightens up considerably..too bad the bulk of the film was not like it. And, although taken from the book, there is a gratuitous swipe at clergy or \\"men of the cloth\\" that has nothing to do with the plot, but is social commentary from the 1800's. Essentially stating (by the Ghost of Christmas Present) that men of the cloth have little to do with the spirit of Christmas reeks of some kind of agenda that is totally out of place in this film. Buy the Alastair Simm version for a real treat or even the delightful British 70's musical version, \\"Scrooge\\", if you want to feel good.  And God bless us, every one!

B002ZG98ZA|3.0|It's still the \\"girls\\", but not the best portrayal of characters.  It has a strange look for most of the movie- and not in a good way.  I don't think Blue Ray aged the actresses- but something about the film style is entirely unflattering.  Worth watching once just to have some continuation of the stories.
030746363X|1.0|A pound is 3500 calories. To live, you must burn calories--amounts will vary, but for a guy like Ferris (see his blog, I read his first book, he is a fit, active, trim guy), probably 2500 to 2800 calories a day would be a reasonable. Ferris says you can add 34 pounds of muscle---MUSCLE alone---in 28 days. That would mean having to consume about 6750 calories or more each day to do that. (Mass comes from somewhere--from the food we eat. You can't add more mass than the food you consume, regardless how you exercise. It has to be made of something.) And then you'd have to have some magical formula to make sure that weight added that quickly would ONLY be muscle. Now, assuming that some is not going to be muscle, you're going to have to have more calories to get just the muscles (and you'll be adding more than 34 pounds to your weight, because you'll be adding fat). So we're probably up to eating about 7500, maybe 8000 calories a day. (Drink A Gallon Of Milk A Day? That is about 2500 calories if it's whole milk. Drink 3? Yeah, I want to see that.) But never mind adding fat---the numbers for adding purely and exclusively muscle are prima facie ridiculous. And he does it all with only four hours TOTAL in the gym! Like ANY time in the gym makes a difference.  Of course, you can also add weight in water, and that requires no calories. It shows up as lean mass if you measure immediately after drinking water--you can add 8 pounds of \\"lean mass\\" made of just water, simply by drinking a gallon of water in a half an hour. Great for that final weigh-in that \\"proves\\" you added 30-umpteen pounds of muscle, or \\"fat-free mass\\" (make up your mind, already) in 28 days.  Now, spread the principles that led to this Ferris claim around to every chapter in the book. How dumb does he think his readers are? 6750 calories a day? He thinks readers are pretty dumb.
1597801585|5.0|`The Windup Girl' was the debut novel from Paolo Bacigalupi. The novel actually won the prestigious science fiction/fantasy literary award, The Hugo, in 2009 for Best Novel. . . so I wasn't too surprised that the book was fantastically impressive.<br /><br />The story is set in twenty-second century Bangkok. This futuristic location allows Bacigalupi to highlight and magnetize the various ways that humanity has managed to clog the world. This century has been choked by climate change, oil reserves have been pillaged and mega corporations are bleeding society dry and capitalizing on the world's downturn. As a result, the world now mostly functions on animal-power (think `The Flinstones'), food is scarce and under threat from bio-terrorism, and rising tides have seen most coastal towns wiped out. Thus, the Bangkok of the distant future is surrounded by seawalls, behind which lies an ominous ocean. . .<br /><br />Bacigalupi's world is a terrifying imagining, mostly because it's so believable. There is an element of steampunk to this Bangkok, where wind-up springs have come technological leaps and bounds as stores of energy. . . but the animal-powering, the horrendously black effects of climate-change and the general mish/mash of great technology coupled with forced past-times makes for an eerie futuristic world. This twenty-second century is just one stand-out in Bacigalupi's richly imagined novel.<br /><br />The story is focused on Anderson Lake, a `calorie man' working undercover for a mega corporation. Lake's job is to search for untainted food sources (anything that hasn't been raped by genetic modification), and in a world where calories are life and food is scarce, Lake is big business. But Lake is side-tracked from his mission when he discovers a Windup Girl named Emiko. A Windup Girl is genetically engineered to serve the Japanese (think Geisha-Girl robot slave), but Emiko was abandoned by her `master' and now resides in Thailand where she earns her keep at a sex club.<br /><br />Anderson Lake is thrown into a world of corporate backlash when he discovers that Thailand has a private seed bank and a rogue geneticist who could be his ticket to the big-time. But Lake's infatuation with Emiko could ruin everything, as could the government's involved in stealing Thailand's seed bank.<br /><br />I'm not normally a `fantasy' reader. I slant more towards paranormal and urban fantasy, with heavy doses of `romance' thrown in. But I've got to hand it to Bacigalupi. . . he drew me in and never let up and as much as `The Windup Girl' isn't my typical reading fare, I was completely wrapped up in the story from page one.<br /><br />The world Bacigalupi has imagined is broken and fantastical; equal parts intricate and breath-taking, while also offering a terrifying glimpse into future collapse.<br /><br />The world-building is definitely the stand-out in this novel. Anderson Lake and Emiko never quite reached the same heights with their characterization as the twenty-second century did with its landscape. . . regardless; I was just as invested in their story. Emiko was a test-tube product of this world's greed and instant gratification, and Anderson Lake was the epitome of that greed. These two had a beautifully complicated story that was a nice point of balance amidst the mega-corporation double-dealings.<br /><br />Having now read Bacigalupi's impressive debut, I can understand why he so deserved the coveted Hugo award. `The Windup Girl' is full of fantasy flair, set in a terribly realistic future it tells of a sad love story and an even sadder story of humanity. . . brilliant.e is thrown into a world of corporate backlash when he discovers that Thailand has a private seed bank and a rogue geneticist who could be his ticket to the big-time.

B00498YZH8|4.0|I generally don't write long, or spoiler-filled reviews. I see why this film won those awards. It's very authentic. The nicest thing I can say? I recall a project by Billy Bob Thornton. He tried to recreate the same environment. I think he failed pretty badly @that. This movie doesn't. John Hawkes did an excellent job in this. The new kid Jennifer also did very well. Just because a film lacks flash & glitz. That doesn't mean it isn't good. Some of this film's best parts are given through subtleties. Sadly, I think many viewers will miss them. The mountain subcultures have their own mores, values, & hierarchies. I'd say this project captured much of that quite nicely. Well Done :-).
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Gets my vote for one of the best openings ever in a movie.Splendid performances.And a most of the stories are wonderful.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Thank you very much!!! It came in wicked fast, could not beleive it!!! The movie is a real chick flick, my favorite movies!!! Have watched it at least 27 times with my daughters since the purchase. We love Jane Austen and this movie gave it such a spin, really well done. Would def buy from this supplier again. Nice job, fast and in perfect condition. Thank you again!!!
B002ZG99QS|4.0|This movie feels awkward at first because longtime fans are not sure what to expect. The cult fanbase of Tron should not go into this expecting another groundbreaking event, but that doesn't mean it's all bad. The movie spends a lot of time updating us with what's happened at ENCOM over the past 28 years. Later, when you see those light cycles racing in 3D with surround effects, you feel that same electric wonder from 1982! Yes, the acting is cheesy and much of the storyline is rehashed (get in, get out), but the visuals, music, and morals of this new chapter are what make it worth watching. The first Tron was made when personal computers had positive potential, before greed plagued them with viruses and careless developers. This continuation recants the naivety of its prequel as Kevin Flynn now proclaims that perfection is already in front of us: family, nature, and freewill. Tron Legacy is simply a fun, stylized, and ultra-cool reminder that computers are tools, not a substitute for life.

I bought the double-DVD set with the extra minions movies on it (didn't have a chance to watch that one yet, but that's next on my list).

1556347308|5.0|I have been a gamer for over 30 years. I am not about the numbers or the rules as much as the story and the role playing. I have played most RPGs in my time, D&D (every edition), White Wolf (All of it), Shadowrun, Torg, Dresden, Star Wars (D6, D20, Saga), and a ton of other stuff. I have avoided GURPS for a long time, mainly because of the 'sound' of the system. I am here now to eat some crow. This game is hands down one of the, if not the best game I have ever played. In a word it is amazing. The core mechanic is simple and at first you might think that it is limited by that mechanic but that couldn't be further from the truth. It is a deep and immersive system filled with complexity. It caters to both Role Players and \\"roll\\" players. It is a power gamers dream but gives the ability of a story teller to do anything with it. You can play free style or with a battle mat. You can add cards or just use dice. You can play anything from cyberpunk to Tolken. You want Zombie Ninja Rabbits? There is a rule for that. The game is only limited by your imagination and still remains balanced. If you are a gamer and love good RPGs, this is a game you really need to try. You do however, need the Character and Campaign books to play effectively.    Bottom Line: I love this game.

031603438X|5.0|This book dispells and confirms all the (mis)conceptions you may  have had about Keith Richards. The common misconception is that his brain is addled by drugs and he lives as a walking shadow of a living person. Not true. While there are certainly residuary effects of his past drug use, he relates the events in his life with remarkable clarity and detail, even from his earliest days. One can certainly say, \\"Well, he has had help in recalling events.\\" In some degree this may be true. Richards has occasionally employed a brilliant device of inserting a narrative of events of his personal and professional life from the actual partcipants. For example, he included in several spots statements from his son, Marlon, about particularly troubling and problematic periods of his life. This device only serves to enhance the narrative of his life and supplement what he could have otherwise contributed to the story.<br /><br />He does not make any apologies for his well-known excesses and extravagences. He describes with brutal honesty the checkered us and downs in his personal and legal life,and troubles with the law. But to his credit he does not put himself out to be a role model nor does he recommend his life style for the reader. In fact, in several places in the book he states, \\"Don't do this at home.\\" So his honesty and forthrightness is not questioned. There was perhaps too much honesty in the book. The most notable example is with heroin. He matter of factly describes his own addiction and travails but also states those individuals, with a hint of regret, he got addicted with the drug.<br /><br />His memoir illuminates his relationships with his soul mate, Mick Jaggar, and with Anita Pallinberg. I felt there was a lot left out when discussing Brian Jones, that he was only glossing over the events of that relationship ... or it is at all possible that there was not much more to the dissolution of that Stone than what he explains. Only Keith, Mick, and Anita know for sure.<br /><br />Overall, of course, this is a highly interesting and recommended read.course, this is a highly interesting and recommended read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|As a mom of two I was able to lose my 70 lbs of baby weight fairly rapidly, (I'm 5'8\\" and usually 130 but end up around 200 while pregnant) but couldn't seem to get back in real shape due to time constraints.  Driving to the gym, getting the kids ready, packing myself up etc I'd burn hours before I even started on my workout.  After baby 2 (and around 30)I had a harder time getting back in shape after losing the weight.  My husband and I tried a trial membership at the local gym only to find them returning my baby 20-30 minutes into my workout repeatedly.  I researched like crazy for an option I could do at home while short on time.  My entire life I've been an athlete and kept in pretty good shape but babies just do some serious damage.  I knew I wanted a workout that would truly challenge me physically and was under 30 minutes long, but does it truly exist.    Shockingly yes it does.... this workout is hard enough to make me sore and give me my 6 pack back rapidly.    Many friends lately have been asking me for my secret and I know I've sold at least two of these dvds.  It's my go-to summers coming workout for bikini's... I'm currently doing it for a month trip to Mexico so my butt is in tip top shape for swimsuits, and it's fantastic for jean shopping.  Really everything I could ask for.  I highly recommend this for moms on the go who just don't have time for the gym yet it's been the best workout dvd ever and for WAY less than a crazy membership at our local gym what do you really have to lose it pays for itself in a week easily.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|Great headset that was an easy setup.  The only tough part was trying to go back and find all my original PS3 wiring because I needed a cable for the mic to work.  I wish it would have told me that before buying.  So for those about to buy, the USB cable only gets your headphones to work so you can hear the game.  You need to get your original PS3 cables and find this one tiny cable to make the mic work.      Once setup, it works great.  I know the cable is 15 ft, but I wish it were longer.   I have a 55\\" TV with PS3 setup above the TV, so I have to bring the cable around behind and under the TV to keep it out of the way... so I'm restricted to sitting within 10 ft of the screen.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is the greatest set of mysteries EVER!  Acting... Superior! Holmes and Watson are fantastic ...and there is a welcomed balance between both the Watson and Holmes characters!  Plotting... Outstanding! With all the deep twists and turns that you would ever want!  And the BEST gift is ...  When you have all of the above, you also get every episode 90 minutes long, with enough time to develop all of the characters and not rush through the wonderful plots!  One new and fantastic note about how the stories are filmed...   Instead of having Holmes just think and later reveal the solution to a problem (leaving you in the dark about how he did it), the screen writers not only show you what Holmes sees at a crime scene, but presents the key elements (wet, dry, polished, smooth, worn, etc.) [WORDS!] on the screen for you to know what he is thinking. They do this also when texts are sent from one character to another. You see the text on the screen. This is awesome - and such a simple storyline adjustment! It not only makes the story clearer, it brings  the viewer deeper into the mysteries, and, therefore,  the viewer becomes more a part of the solutions.  Buy it, if you love a great mystery! It's great to see Holmes and Watson in the 21st century - and in movies that truly deserve a top rating!
B000JML90Y|5.0|Okay--everyone has heard of Darwin's classic on the origin of the species. But how many of us have actually read it? I've read a lot of other books on evolution, and amongst them, I would recommend \\"Why evolution is true\\". But I had never actually read the book that brought it all about. Then there it was, available on Kindle, for free. What did I have to lose?<br /><br />Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I was thinking--this guy lived so long ago. Would I be able to follow his now-dated English? Not being a biologist, I thought that this book would certainly be over my head. But to my surprise, it was not. It's quite readable, by me and just about any common Joe or Mary.<br /><br />This is no small feat. Consider that at the time, most people believed in special creation--that every species had been specially created by a supreme being to fill a specific niche. Looking around at how well creatures fit their niches, this seemed so obvious. Of course, we now know that there are no permanent \\"special niches\\". The geologic record testifies to tremendous changes in the earth's climate, from times when there was almost no oxygen in the earth's atmosphere, to ice ages that covered almost the entire surface of the earth, to mass extinctions due to giant meteor strikes or super-volcanoes. Evolutionary life has been \\"set back\\", so to speak, many many times, and it is only because life is able to evolve through natural selection that new organisms evolve from their ancestors to fill ever-changing niches.<br /><br />Darwin wrote in a clear and simple style--and as one who tries to keep abreast of scientific literature, I can say with a certainty that this is a rarity. Yes, YOU can understand this book, and I have learned a lot about clear writing from it. Darwin kept it simple. As should we all!<br /><br />Darwin was also an honest writer. With his vast knowledge of both human and plant anatomy, he realized and acknowledged the gaps in his theory, and did not shy away from them. Most have been since resolved due to a more extensive fossil record, the development of the science of genetics, advances in geology (including continental drift and more extensive understanding of the earth's geological history) and advanced dating techniques. Consider that without the evidence that all of these scientific advances has revealed, Darwin was able to piece together an explanation of how the different species came to be--an explanation now well-supported by these various disciplines. His ideas quickly took hold, spreading throughout the world in less than 150 years, and revolutionized the way we look at ourselves and our world. I am hard-pressed to think of a single idea that has spread so fast in the course of human history, and with such explanatory force.<br /><br />No, it's not a Tom Clancy thriller. But you can take a lot away from it, and as a freebie, you can't go wrong.ed due to a more extensive fossil record, the development of the science of genetics, advances in geology (including continental drift and more extensive understanding of the earth's geological history) and advanced dating techniques.

0793563836|5.0|I received this course today. I looked at the table of contents and thumbed through the pages. There's a lot of material. There is some tab, however, most of the lessons are built on learning and strengthening your ability to read music notation. the 1-2-4 fretting method is included. I like this method because my hands are small and I have difficulty with the 1-2-3-4 fretting method. However, you can use any method that suites you. There are three CD's...one for each book. The 143 pages are easy to turn. I can easily use my music stand when I practice. I enjoyed playing along with the CD's. I read the music I was playing. Then I improvised. I'm an experienced musician. However, my music theory is weak. I'm going to complete all three courses. I look forward to practicing every day. This is a great course if you want to learn how to play bass, and read music notation and tabs. If you get through this course, you'll be ready to take a great leap in your music career. It's also a great source of learning even if you are content to just play at home. It's fun and you'll enjoy the learning process. I wish you the best in your music career!

030746363X|2.0|Pretty shocked he went to Princeton. His writing style is very frustrating. It rambles, constantly refers to things he has not yet discussed, a real mess of a book.   He spends an incredibly long time trying to discuss a precious few points. Almost as if he feels obligated to put all this confusing fluff in to fill the pages so the book is thick enough.  Its a lot like a high school student trying to get enough weight for his term paper.  If he really practiced what he preached about efficiency the book could have been about 20-50 pages and would have been a lot more clear.     What would have been really helpful is one chapter that bolis everything down in a non confusing summary.     On the positive side he does introduce a few exercises that were good and I hadn't done before.     Reading the book I couldn't help but be reminded of the Yale grad that had that viral video resume where he was a ballroom dancer, lifted a huge amount of weight, karate expert, and \\"pro\\" tennis player. Ferriss seems to be cut from the same cloth and is definitely cracking in the immortal words of Walter Sobchak.  All the MRI nonsense was a real window into his soul, crazier than a S house rat.      Also I dislike all the ballot box stuffing that went on with the five star reviews. My guess is that he paid a bunch of 3rd world $4 an hour employees to write all these reviews.

This makes watching the movie very frustrating although I did find a way to get the movie to play it is a very annoying problem when watching a Twilight marathon...   Don't buy this disc.

If you read the second one, the third one is a must-read.<br /><br />I found this book more exciting than the first two and simply couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I was concerned that the 3rd book would end unsatisfactorily due to the untimely death of the author who never finished writing the millennium series, but that was not the case.

B00005JKNF|5.0|The dialogue is brisk, full of intrigue, wryly humorous, and moving.  The parallels between life below stairs and above stairs is deeply compelling.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Amazingly well done, but ,warning!  extremely graphic, language, violence, nudity, etc  the storyline and acting are excellent.  Andy Whitfield gives a stellar performance as spatacus.  Let's hope he's back in action soon.
0545123275|4.0|Shiver was my first taste of Maggie Stiefvater, but it won't be my last. I won't write a synopsis of the book because other reviewers here have already done that. What captured me about Shiver was the lyrical, romantic language that infused the story with an air of melancholy. Grace has loved her wolf (Sam) since she was a young girl. It's an obsessive, impossible sort of love, and even though she recognizes the impossibility of it, that doesn't make it less real.<br /><br />Being a few weeks post read, I can recognize the plot weaknesses outlined by a previous reviewer regarding the science of the wolves and the cure, but honestly, while I was engaged in reading the story none of that mattered at all. As an author, I know that plot and plausibility are important. I also know that sometimes a reader just wants a gentle story that unfolds beautifully.<br /><br />I closed this book with a sigh of contentment.<br /><br />Well done, Maggie Stiefvater.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I wish I had seen this when I was taking American History in high school.  Wow!  History comes alive with this series.  It is impossible to watch without appreciating the price that was paid for our freedom.  Huge sacrifices were made on so many fronts and it is humbling to be reminded.  We used this series to enhance our homeschool curriculum this year.  A wonderful addition to any home movie library!!  Order this --- it is AWESOME!
6303122647|1.0|My fault for not realizing this was VHS.  Although new, hoping it will play.  This thing looks like its been in the basement for the last 20 years.  Very disappointed but again I got what I paid for, I guess.  Just praying the quality is better then its appearance.
B0043RSE2M|4.0|Yes I loved the movie, But why would I invest in 4 discs of the same movie is beyond me, just a 3D blu ray version and regular blu ray on the other side of the same disc (with extra features) would me more than enough..actually how many of us really use the blu ray, the dvd & even the digital copy?? and why boast the fact that Blu ray discs have the capacity to hold data worth 5 DVD's when most compaines put just one version of the film on one blu ray disc?? then make us buy the extended/directors cut a few months later and then again the 3D version a couple of months later..and wait the 5th, 10th and 25th aniversary..just not fair to fans of any movie!!!!

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I am hooked. Is there nicotine in this CD?  I have Live In London for 6 weeks and a day doesn't go by that I don't listened to some part of it. The Future sounds like Chris Rea, right? Call me crazy, but the music makes me happy and look inward -- easier to do my writing and work much more than normal as I listen; too bad it loops around in my head even in a dream state. As a writer, I use it for background and inspiration. If I'm down, I use it for a lift.  I've hooked my husband (and dog) on this album as well.  Leonard Cohen is 78 years old and still at hot as ever!  I wish I could've seen him in concert last year in FL, but I missed out-- Please ! Do it again, Leonard. And (HEY, If I weren't married, I'd go right after this guy. HE IS SOO CO0L -- even though I wouldn't be his type, I can dream! ;) What is the matter with Rebecca De...?
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I've followed A7X since they came out with City of Evil, when they decided to change the singing to a more \\"mainstream\\" application. This title from the band showcases some great singing by M.Shadows, but its strong suit is the guitar playing by both Zacky and Synister. While the guitar playing on all tracks is wonderful, the track that really won me over is \\"Buried Alive\\". The intro is an easy piece played with so much feeling, and the song ends into a roller coaster of guitar riffs that leaves you drenched and begging for more! That said, the metal guitar fan will have a blast listening to the great lyrics and awesome riffs that these guys have put together. And while they have lost their drummer, Mike Portnoy (formerly of Dream Theater) does a great job filling in obviouly ;) I thoroughly enjoyed this CD, and I can't wait for the boys' next release!
B003UMW68Y|3.0|I abstained from Nightmare Before Christmas for years because (much like The Goonies) it has just been forced into popular culture, where I don't think it belongs. Neither film was massively popular or a critical success on their original release, but somewhere along the line the spirit of the films were hijacked.<br /><br />I hate seeing forlorn-looking, middle-class emo teenagers wearing Jack Skellington T-shirts as much as I hate the same crowd yelling \\"Hey you, guys.\\" Were they even born when these films were made? Back to the film itself, it's a rather simple tale of a Halloween-themed world being exposed to the magic of Christmas. Jack Skellington and the denizens of Halloweentown welcome the magic, but no one really seems to understand that the macabre of Halloween and the Spirit of Christmas are utterly incongruous. I suppose this is a commentary on the inconsistency of what the public desires and how we are all easily programmed to like what the media tells us to like.<br /><br />The thin story is interspersed with several, generic Danny Elfman melodies and songs. The characters are amusing, especially the Mayor of Halloweentown, who's double-sided head periodically rotates between happiness and despair. And the atmosphere is also very nice, but I'm undecided if it's a Halloween film or an Xmas film.<br /><br />Overall, it's good, but not great. It's more like The Trap Door than it's like Wallace and Gromit, but still a pleasant distraction for the Xmas season.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks great in 1.66:1 1080p HD, and has a decent amount of features.
B000YRY8BG|1.0|I received and returned two copies of this miniseries because episode 2 of the first disk had serious skips, often returning to the beginning of the disk.  I very much want a copy of this superb program but am afraid to reorder.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I would certainly give the program five stars were it not for the technical glich.
030746363X|5.0|I pre-ordered the book through B&N and received it a couple days after it released on the 14th.  My husband and I have been fighting (okay, little strong) over reading rights to this book.  Yes, we're enjoying it that much.    We treating it as Tim suggested - like a buffet.  Been skipping around here and there, picking and choosing what appeals to us at any given time.  A lot of great stories, a lot of take-away tips, and just a lot of fun to read.  We've found it to be very applicable to us --- we're twentysomethings who are very active and have been looking for ways to improve our diet and strength.  I'll admit that I've shaken my head at many of Tim's suggestions (and anecdotal evidence) but I'm willing to try some of it.  And much of what I've been reading so far has been corroborated by my own experiences in the past few months (namely with kettlebells and the explosive results I've achieved with minimal effort) -- so it's not all gobbledigook.  I'm seriously considering photocopying a few chapters for my dad and brother to read at this point... maybe even purchase a few more copies for them.  There are some real gems in here.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Awesome movie!!  A must have for any Harry Potter fan.  Amazing visual as always! Amazing story! Everything is great; however, it's definitely not the best of the series.  Deathly Hollow for the win!!
B000KFB4PK|1.0|It is really a toy for watching. but not counting time. It goes slowly, at least 20 minutes behind real time a day.
B00110K62U|4.0|I've read quite a few of the comments about this DVD and the quality of the Picture.  I feel that people are missing a glaring point.  This disc was recorded in the UK.  The UK uses an entirely different format for recording and broadcasting TV.  They use the PAL format.  In the US, where many are playing this, we use the NTSC format.  In the transfer from one format to the other, much picture quality is lost.  Be reminded of all those old British comedies that you can watch on PBS stations.  The quality is not as sharp...due to the Transfer process.    The other issue it that it was recorded in 1995.  Go watch some 'old' football films/games from 1995, and you'll see the quality has improved much since then. People have also complained about Dolby sound quality. Again, it's the 1995 recording.
B003XKPPOU|4.0|The movie was brand new and in the casing still. However the outercase was a little torn at the edges and such. Whether this was just through shipping or if it was sent like this it was kind of a disapointment. Over all though I was pleased that I could find something at this kind of quality without leaving my home.
0143039881|5.0|Totalitarian organizations and regimes cannot survive without collaboration and omission from common people. I'm over 40 and it was only with this book, that I just finished a few weeks ago, that I begin to have a grasp of what really happened in Germany and Europe in the Holocaust.<br />It is very easy to demonize a few historic personages (like Hitler, Goebbels, Eichmann etc.) in Hollywood movies and the mainstream media, but it takes the kind of courage and competence Hannah Arendt showed in her book to make us reflect about the small \\"Holocausts\\" that may be happening today and very close to us because of our lack of political action.<br />What makes her pages, written decades ago, so important today is the unveiling of the obscure paths that go from intolerance as a diffuse element in every society to the centerpiece of a state politic.<br />Still revolutionary after all these years.<br />Still deserving to be read, analyzed and commented, specially by the youth.

B003YP7N9O|3.0|First off, this is a superb record, the bonus material is great, and the sound is improved versus older versions of the CD. This should be two discs and priced at or around $20.<br /><br />But to bump the price up over $30, the thieves who put this package together included a \\"DVD\\" which is exactly the same as the 2nd CD - the Carnegie Hall concert, with a static photograph while the music plays. Huh? Ok they included a short interview with Ian Anderson, but this is a brazen laugh in your face rip off. Unless you read the packaging really closely, you assume that there's actually VIDEO on the DVD - oh, how naive! This is the kind of crap that makes people hate record companies.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|If you've never experienced this film, you should!  Watch it without any distractions though, as I know people who have \\"watched\\" it (half-heartedly), and completely missed the entire point of the storyline.  Once you really \\"get\\" the story, it will affect how you look at life.  Pay special attention to the way George's youthful optimism turns cynical.  George thinks that he is a failure because his life didn't unfold as he planned, but finally realizes his life is much BETTER than HE ever could have planned it.  George has friends and family who love him and so he has everything in life that matters.

B004132HZS|5.0|Being a Sherlockian, I am very critical about movie/TV versions of Conan Doyle's most revered work of literature. I was skeptical when I heard about a modern-day set Sherlock Holmes. But I was pleasantly surprised, and by the first 15 minutes of the first episode, I was hooked. The makers did a splendid and clever job of taking the original mysteries and \\"vamping\\" them up. If you have read the stories, you will get extra joy in understanding the references to the actual stories. The casting, too, is superb. Benedict Cumberbatch is the second-best Holmes I have ever seen; the role seems to come quite natural to him.    \\"Sherlock\\" is definitely worth buying. Not only does it include scenes that American channels cut out for time (scenes that didn't need to be cut out at all, and which are hilarious and important to the plotlines), but also the making of \\"Sherlock\\" - which is very interesting - and the Pilot of the first episode, which is definitely a must-see. But \\"Sherlock\\" isn't just for Sherlockians only; anyone who merely loves mysteries and sarcastic humor will enjoy it greatly. I look forward to the next season!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Now, I felt the need to write this review for season four because it wasn't just so freakin' good (I mean, it really really was) but because out of all five seasons, season four is by far the best season (so far). Many people point out the plots, but no ones mentioned why this season is more appealing then the other four. Like every season Dexter tackles the, \\"Dark Passenger vs Human Self.\\" But what makes season four so interesting and exciting is the fact that Dexter is no longer asking himself, \\"Can I keep up this cover?\\" but \\"How can I keep up this cover?\\" Dexter, a serial killer/Blood Splatter Analyst, finally gets hitched. He has a baby, two step children and a brand new house in a brand new community. What made the premiere for season four so nail biting was the fact that Dexter--the guy who prefers to be alone and claims Rita and the kids are a cover--is committed to being a husband, father, and Cop (well not really, but he's got a badge) while pleasing his Dark Passenger. How the hell is he gonna juggle so many roles and keep his cool? First episode ends badly for the guy (you can't help but love him) and it really rains on his parade. That's why when the Trinity Killer comes into play, a serial killer so clean, and invisible that he's hardly \\"real\\", he can't help but be amazed and wonder how he does it. Through out the season we discover who this Trinity Killer is and how he effects Dexter.<br /><br />Despite the other subplots and even Trinity's role (played by the fabulous John Lithgow), season four changes Dexter in many ways. As much as he claims marriage is a cover he can't deny he cares for his kids and Rita. We already knew this going into the season, but season four really draws out the nurturing caring person Dexter really is behind the Dark Passenger. For years Dexter has done everything to please his Dark Passenger just so he can function and seem, well, normal. But by the end of season four he comes to realize that he needs his family just as much as he needs to please the Dark Passenger. There's one line that really makes this point come to life. Dexter is chasing after the Trinity Killer and his phone rings. Dexter see's the ID--it's Rita. \\"Don't answer it,\\" says Dexter's dad (who's not really there and plays the Dark Passenger in him. Sorta). \\"What if something wrong with the baby?\\" Dexter replies while picking up the phone. At that moment the Dexter we met in season one, the calm, neat monster, is no longer identified by Dexter himself but as a loving father and husband. (Who just needs to kill to stay sane. :) )<br /><br />Through out the season Dexter evolves, making him a more lovable serial killer then ever. He goes from, \\"How can I keep up this cover?\\" to \\"How can I keep my family?\\" And the best (saddest) part is, Dexter himself isn't aware of this change until the very end. Michael C Hall got a Globe for this season and he deserved it. I've never seen Dexter so tangled in himself and so \\"Dark Passenger can wait.\\" I've never seen such a drastic change to our sweet serial killer--a change that gave us one of the best seasons of any show on television ever.needs to please the Dark Passenger.

B000002UYZ|4.0|You have to wonder at this late date what the function is of this 1962-66 Red Album and its bookend, [[ASIN:B003YNFYD8 1967-1970 (Blue]]. Last year we had massive remasters of all the Beatles Albums, English and American, mono and stereo, EMI and Ebbits. The fabs are also now on I-Tunes. The Beatles finally have the digital ubiquity they should have gotten in the mid-1980s.<br /><br />The Red and the Blue albums were issued in 1973, three years after  the Beatles broke up. To me, the idea of a \\"hits\\" package for the best band, the true eighth wonder, is antithetical. Even in 1963, the group was making albums that held together as such when most were just slapping singles together surrounded by filler.<br /><br />And you really do need to hear every sound of every album--none of us will--to understand rock and Western Music itself. That is a lifetime undertaking. There really are no short cuts with the Beatles: if you get Red and Blue, you may think you found an inexpensive way to learn about this band, but you are going to wind up thinking that you wasted money in the end.  You'll be buying every album very soon anyhow. These sets are a good overview, but in 2010, there are quicker ways to do get this.<br /><br />Trust me, get these sets if you are a complete collector, but if you are just starting out, you might as well just get, say, Please Please Me, Revolver and Sgt Pepper on day one, and start your headlong dive right in.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|This movie was not bad but it was not the best ether. Their are things to like about the film action, story, good actors, but i just can't get over the fact that this film they said was to be action packed epic climax that sort of thing which it was and was not i give it four stars because it deserves four stars for a least a good try but this movie fails to bet prince of persia and the sorcers appretice. This film is a good movie if you do not expect a star wars type movie or a matrix type movie because this movie does not compare to the matrix trilogy or star wars. But it is still worth a look.

B002ZG99QS|5.0|Before I begin, I will tell you that I have never seen the original Tron--nor do I have any desire to. I've seen clips and I do not find it visually appealing. I understand the gist of the plot and the character's involved and know enough to understand the references in Tron: Legacy. That being said, I loved Tron: Legacy so much that I've seen it twice.<br /><br />2D vs 3D. I must say that I despise this 3D trend because the movies I have seen in 3D did not feel like it added anything spectacular to it. When I think of 3D, I think of objects flying out of the screen and feeling like I could reach out my hand and touch them. With Tron: Legacy, there was so much potential here. A disc flying out, programs disintegrating in front of you..etc etc. There were moments where it felt like my eyes were crossed, more than anything. I don't doubt that certain scenes like the lightcycle grid and disc wars, the 3D really enhanced them, but I'm not sure it was worth the extra four bucks. The second time, I saw it in regular 2D and walked away feeling like the special effects were just as amazing. Now there were a couple of parts in 2D where things looked almost fake and you can tell that they were supposed to be 3D but not so much that it bothers you. The best part about the 3D experience was the trailers you saw before the movie, especially the intro for the Real 3D.<br /><br />There were a couple of things that annoyed me. For one, Kevin Flynn's overuse of 'man', 'radical', etc etc. The number of Star Wars references was another thing. The great purge of the ISOs...sounds like order 66 ie, the great jedi purge. During the dogfight scene, I expected Kevin to tell Sam not to get cocky. Perhaps I only see them that way because Star Wars is my geekdom, but obviously I was able to make connections.<br /><br />I do wish there had been greater detail about how Kevin created this new grid and how he was able to manifest a living space in the outlands. But that's not something that makes the movie bad for me. It just makes me thirst for more of the universe.<br /><br />I feel like there are very subtly placed possibilities for a continuation of the franchise and I have mixed feelings about that. It would be nice for a film to actually have an final ending, but at the same time, I feel like there is a lot of room to flesh this out and maybe answer those questions that others have asked.<br /><br />As far as acting goes, I think Garrett Hedlund did a good job in his role. I liked the character Quorra and would love to see her developed further.<br /><br />I will anxiously await this movie to be put out on blu-ray.. It just makes me thirst for more of the universe.

0671015206|5.0|My mother handed me this book shortly after it came out when I was in my 40's. I didn't become as much of a hermit as the books' examples are, but I learned where I could be frugal without making any serious sacrifice of life's enjoyment or material goods. I also learned pitfalls to avoid.<br /><br />As a result, I became a much better comparison shopper and saver. I was able to retire at age 56. In retirement, I'm effectively living as if I had several thousands more in current annual income than I do because of the lessons and attitude I got from this book and like-minded people.<br /><br />I'm on this page now because I'm purchasing a copy for my much younger brother.

B003B13QQU|1.0|As a long time fan I have to say I was extremely disappointed in this album.  Taking cues for musical styling is one thing, attempting to lower the bar on the worst of 80's synthpop truly takes effort and talent to pull off...  And Goldfrapp has no lack of talent.  It's unfortunate that they decided to so effectively throw out much of what made them popular, and throw it along with a fan following that was readily turned off by Seventh tree's radically different sound.  At least I could stand to listen to Seventh Tree on CD, and in concert it was mostly OK to listen to as long as they threw in some of the back catalog that made them popular.    Personally I found this album to be lacking in originality, and full of ham-fisted arrangements that just make me cringe.  Perhaps I'm just not the target demographic here, and really this is some sort of pseudo time machine for people who didn't actually live through the 80's.    I think at this point I'll stick to their older music, and if they return to it or evolve into a style I can appreciate once more I'll consider myself a fan again.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|Great DVD series. We enjoy watching these shows over and over to see things we missed. The extras are great with a lot of input from the cast and stars
B00204AA0O|1.0|I really enjoyed the album \\"Begin to Hope\\" and felt certain \\"Far\\" would be of the same caliber. What I enjoy about Regina Spektor is that quirky,cryptic,poetic energy that she expresses with sorrow or sass. I love the kind of music that stops me in my tracks like the song \\"Samson\\". Or the song \\"Fidelity\\" which begs you to memorize the lyrics, and maybe you'd get a giggle out of \\"Hotel Song\\". There was something soulful about that album, a kind of growing pain that you could set on replay for hours.    On the other hand, I dont have much love for the album \\"Far\\". While her voice maintains something beautiful, and she can skip it around and bounce it off melodies like a stone on water... its the lyrics or content that bugs me. If \\"Begin to Hope\\" was deep, mature, and thoughtful- \\"Far\\" regresses to juvenile, boring, and weird. Yes, its all done with a beautiful voice and that same quirky enthusiasm. But as much as I wanted to be impressed or blown away by this album, I wasnt.    You can take the most beautiful singer in the world, and they can sing the dumbest song ever and you'd probably like it just because the voice was beautiful. They could sing in another language, and you'd probably love it without knowing what the song was about. But if you give a great voice a song of substance it will transcend time, culture, genere, age, etc.    Ten years from now, unless you are a die hard fan, no one will remember this album as Regina's standout piece of work. It's my opinion that when people introduce Ms. Spektor to others they will recommend \\"Begin to Hope\\" as opposed to her other albums.
1933492953|5.0|The book \\"framed ink\\" is not a \\"How-To-Draw\\" book, rather than a \\"How-To-See\\" book. Those of you who search for maticulous step-by-step instructional book for comics and illustrations are recommended to search elsewhere (Burne Hogarth's books would be great for that, in my opinion). This book is all about the fine art of composition. Whether you're an aspiring animator, an experienced comic book artist or whatever - this book, brought by one of the most highly acclaimed artists in film industry (check the preface from Jeffery Katzenberg)is a masterclass in constructing a frame for any illustrative need (storyboard, animation sequence, graphic novel etc.).     You can draw the most beautiful, eye-dazzling imagery and still have no \\"life\\" or sense of belivability in your paintings and sequences. Once you get a hold of Mr. Mestre's concepts regarding proper division of a frame, direction and meaning within your composition, you are bound to improve your painting-narrating skills almost immediately.     I will most definitely acquire Marcos Mateau-Mestre's future books, once they're out. If you want to improve your paintings, make them more powerful and meaningful, this book would be a great start.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|So I dont have a lot to compare this to, with that being said I LOVE this album. I've heard some of the tracks on commercials but it was word of mouth that inspired me to give them a try.    The music is saucy, wicked, sexy, and bluesy. This music is good for superficial background jamming, and for those who like to listen more closely... you can really enjoy the lyrics as well. I have listened to this album over and over again. I dont think it's one you will tire quickly with... it's just fun!
B0043RSE2M|5.0|I bought this movie as a blind purchase based on reviews I had read, and I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed! The story is thoroughly enjoyable, and there are a lot of laughs.  The minions steal the show, but Gru is quite funny too.  The 3D effect is present all throughout the movie, with a few moments in particular standing out: the roller coaster ride, the needle nose of Gru's ship as it crash lands, the high wire act at the end, Gru in space, and the minions' attempt to touch the screen during the closing credits.  Highly recommended!
B003NFM3JK|2.0|Okay, so motion capture animation has gotten a little better, but more on that later!    I've reviewed a few versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" here on Amazon and finally got around to watching this one. Everybody knows the story about Scrooge by now, and I'm too lazy to go over the synopsis, but I will say much of this adaption is beautifully made and it's fairly faithful to Dickens...fairly.     I suppose we've come to expect cinematic adaptations to be a bit over the top. So when Disney and Jim Carrey decided to come out with their own interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge, we had to know there would be physical comedy, chase scenes and overt sentimentality. It certainly wouldn't have the subtlety of Masterpiece Theater (although wouldn't you love to see their take on the story starring someone like, say, Ian McKellen as Scrooge?) Anyway, over the top is certainly what we got. And I don't mind seeing Scrooge flying over London from the second story of his house, or being chased through the streets by a ghostly horse-drawn carriage, or even needlessly shrinking down to the size of a mouse. The problem is there's SO MUCH of this kind of junk involved, it truncates the spirit of the story. If you were to strip away all the goofy additional material, you would realize you're watching nothing but cliffnotes in motion capture. For example, it just seemed odd that Scrooge would get emotional about Tiny Tim's plight considering he barely had time to connect with the lad.     As far as the horse-drawn carriage chase and the Scrooge-shrinkage, the problem is they go on WAY too long! And it seems to me, the purpose of Scrooge witnessing some of these events in the future are defeated while he's preoccupied fleeing from the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come through London streets or avoiding blows from a poker wielded by Old Joe! You'll see what I mean, when you watch the movie.    Jim Carrey actually does a pretty good job as Scrooge. I just don't understand why him. It seems like any number of fine British actors could have voiced the role, or motion captured the role, or whatever the heck you want to call it. He's not particularly impressive as the Ghost of Christmas Present, however, who's maniacal laughing only annoys after a while. Speaking of the Ghost of Christmas Present, what a horrible way to depict his demise. Nothing expresses \\"Merry Christmas\\" like watching a jolly bearded ghost waste away to bone and ash! Speaking of macabre imagery, I know they meant to be funny when Jacob Marley's jaw cracks open, but double-u-tee-eff? I'm starting to think they missed the boat not having Scrooge resemble Vincent Price! It all would have made sense then! Oh, and I have no idea what was going on with Marley's eyes.     All the other voices were fine, except Colin Firth. An actor I normally love, he seemed to over exaggerate his vocal performance...like he was all too aware he was in an animated feature.     Now about this whole motion capture business. I know they've made some advances in the technology. And it's true the job done on Scrooge himself is the best we've seen so far. But as impressive has his character looks, everyone else still looked (as Dickens described Jacob Marley) dead as a doornail! They just haven't mastered the eyes of the characters and can't shake the creep factor. Perhaps there's something to be said for traditional animation that Robert Zemeckis hasn't figured out. Animated characters should LOOK like animated characters...exaggerated features and all. The more animation strives for reality, the more perfect they need to be in capturing the details, especially the eyes, which are called the \\"windows of the soul\\" for a reason.     These Zemeckis characters are still soulless creatures unable to depict the subtle emotions of Bugs Bunny, let alone a flesh and blood actor!    I wouldn't say this is the worst adaptation of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" I've ever seen as it is handsomely made and highly energetic. Plus, I was intrigued by the Ghost of Christmas Present's lecture regarding \\"men of the cloth\\". Still, it's pretty close to being the worst!
0312370849|2.0|Like many of the other low reviews for this book - I thought it was a quick read that I enjoyed and found intriguing until about half way through - and then I just wanted to finish it and move on.  Predictable and contrived, and Julia and her family members all annoyed me.  Julia turned into a very self-centered character, but that didn't seem to be recognized by the author.  Interestingly, most of my book club really enjoyed it...
0394873742|4.0|I'm organizing xmas stuff and just opened the box this book was in. I was shocked by the size of the book, not thick, but tall and wide. It is slightly smaller than the child I am giving it to. First thought was that this is totally going back, I have no room for a book this size in my already cramped house. Then I opened it and realized how wonderful this book is going to be for him to explore. Just thought the size is a pretty major point that other reviewers have only mentioned.
030746363X|5.0|I'm not quite done reading this book yet, but I am finding lots of useful tips and good information. Some things I knew before, but there are tons of resources here that anyone interested in fitness will find useful. A definite must-have for your fitness reference collection.
B001VNB54A|5.0|All around great 10 part series by HBO. Just as good as Band of Brothers. War scenes are great. Characters are all good! Must have if you are into war movies/series. I think people who are not will still enjoy this. Sounds great on the home theater also!
B003ASLJMW|5.0|I guess it is just normal that a movie that was made so long ago just can't give one the same quality and special effects that we see in movies nowadays. Nevertheless I think it is still a good movie and I have enjoyed seeing it again. Not worth owing the disk tough as I doubt I will want to see it again soon....
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|I love Soundgarden. This is a Must for any Soundgarden Fan. The DVD alone is worth the purchase price, especially the bonus Videos. And then there's the CD's too.. Kim Thayil is a cross between Jimmy Page and Tony Iommi. I hope He holds to His Promise in the Liner Notes that there is more to come.. I can't wait.. And by the way, I'm 56 Years old..
B003UESJF6|5.0|LOVED this movie. I don't personally care for 3D movies, but the standard version of Megamind was great. It's a fantastic underdog story and a feel-good movie with all the right humor.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|A good Christmas movie. Is approprite for any age range, but it could be a little scary for the little ones. It is a good remake of the classic Charles Dicken's Movie. Loved It
B0041KOVUU|5.0|For those out there who are willing to look past the neverending drama, the falling-outs, the outspoken criticisms, the bitterness at faded popularity, and all of the other dark clouds that hang over this band \\"The Smashing Pumpkins\\" (and for that matter, always have hung over them/him), and give the band one more chance, this could be an excellent release to do it with.  Personally, I've found a lot to love in basically everything Corgan has put out this decade - the Zwan era, \\"The Future Embrace\\", \\"Zeitgeist\\", \\"American Gothic\\", \\"SuperChrist\\", and the first \\"Teargarden\\" EP have all had a lot to offer in my humble opinion.    But it's on this release that Corgan has truly embraced the sound and spirit of the old Smashing Pumpkins.  From the moment I got the large, beautiful box and opened it up, I knew this was something different.  The package comes with a marvelous picture disc containing all 4 EP songs, with a bonus track on the reverse.  The disc comes in a lovely printed sleeve.  A CD is also included with full-quality digital versions of the spotlessly produced tracks, in an antique-looking letterpressed cardboard sleeve.  As a physical item, this ranks up there with the best SP releases from the late 90s.    How's the music?  It starts strong with \\"The Fellowship\\", an electronica-drenched 70s arena rocker that really sets the tone for the excitement all over this record.  Next up is \\"Freak\\", which, if you haven't heard yet, you should mosey over to SmashingPumpkins.com and download right away!  Probably the most \\"Pumpkins-y\\" single since... \\"Stand Inside Your Love\\"?  \\"Untitled\\"?  It really conjures the 1993-4 spirit, has a great sound, awesome instrumentation, and lyrics that demand to be chewed on a bit.  \\"Tom Tom\\", meanwhile, feels right out of the \\"Machina\\" era via the Seventies.  An awesome song inspired by the likes of Yes, Rush, and I can hear some Tom Petty meself!  One of my favorite Corgan compositions of the decade, that.  It closes on a lighter note with the winsome \\"Spangled\\", which would not sound out of place in the early-90s incarnation, and picks up Corgan's fascination with the sounds of the 60s and the 20s hanging out together in some weird opium den.  Finally, the b-side \\"Cottonwood Symphony\\" is the first Corgan acoustic track since the Zwan era that is actually really delicate, lyrical, and nostalgic, the way the best of his acoustic songs are (think \\"Meladori Magpie\\", some of the \\"Adore\\" demos, and the Zwan-era \\"Always\\").    I think this is a great product that I've enjoyed immensely.  The record and the CD both sound great and there are no filler tracks here.  As a physical package, it's one of my favorites in years.
B00499K9E0|5.0|I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan since childhood, which was a long time ago. I appreciated the other reviews and so I decided to download, A Study in Pink. My wife and I watched the show along with our 19 year old son who is a sophomore in college. We all loved the show and hope to see much more from this team of actors, writers, and  producers. This is a very entertaining transposition of the tradition into a modern day English setting. Well done!
B0011UBDTK|2.0|Nothing went wrong with the order itself; it arrived on time (early, in fact)and the payment was taken from my account promptly.    When I started to watch, however, is when I started to notice the problems.  I've only gotten as far as Season 3, Episode 3 but in general, the picture quality on all discs leaves a lot to be desired.  Maybe it's because I have a hi-def TV and the show definitely wasn't filmed in hi-def, but the picture is very pixellated and I know I've seen it much clearer on TV.  Also, about 2 or 3 minutes of an episode in Season 1 seems to have been erased...it just pauses for a second and then moves on to the next part of the episode.  To top it off (this is the most aggrevating discovery I've made thus far), you can't even turn the subtitles off on Season 3!    The most disappointing thing is that I'm now outside of the 30 day return window.  How is anyone going to find all of the problems with this in the 30 days?  I can't sit and watch the show in a marathon, so it'll be months before I get to the series finale.
B0043ZDU1E|4.0|I pretty much love all Loreena McKennitt's albums to date and this one does not disappoint.  I love the fact Loreena has returned to a more traditional feel for this album. I beleive old fans and new alike will enjoy this album.
B002KVCA1O|5.0|I never thought I'd like the Stones' music well enough to invest in a full-price CD, but you really can't go wrong with this collection when you consider that you're paying about a quarter for over a dozen instantly-recognizable, top-drawer songs.  As I listened to the CD, I realized how much I had under-rated this group and how stellar some of their songs are.  The sound quality is excellent.
0393072231|5.0|You keep hearing that the financial crisis is to complicated to understand? Anyone who reads this book will will find that it's not to complicated to understand and wonder why no one has gone to jail.
0765318741|4.0|loved the book hated the movie, as alot of you have said.  but if you want a good book try this one
B000063DGC|4.0|THIS IS A TERRIFIC CD. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF OZZY, BLACK SABBATH, RANDY, OR EXTRAORDINARY GUITAR RIFFS, THIS IS THE CD TO BUY!!!!! LOVED IT
B0041KKYEM|5.0|BLACK SWAN is the story of a ballerina driven to insanity by her drive to succeed and to be perfect.  It's also one of the more purely fascinating movies of 2010.  Natalie Portman gives the performance of her career as Nina, the dancer.  Nina has been with the professional ballet company headed by Thomas (Vincent Cassel) for a number of years, and she's hoping this will be the year she gets a lead role.  He's reviving SWAN LAKE, and needs a new White Swan/Black Swan.  Nina is a technically proficient dancer who will do well as the prim, proper, chaste White Swan.  But where is her fiery passion and urgency that will be needed to play the Black Swan?  She doesn't dance with the lack of self-control that his character calls for.    Portman's character is something of a cliché.  How many times do we see the driven perfectionist who can't let go and allow herself to let her feelings show because she's so concerned with getting the technical aspects perfect?  It's hardly a new idea.  Neither is the introduction of the character Lily (Mila Kunis), a carefree, full-of-smiles dancer who joins the company.  She isn't so dedicated to her art that she can't go out and party.  But she dances with the ease and passion that Portman cannot muster.  The two develop a tentative relationship...but is Lily really a fierce competitor, trying to psyche out Nina?    And Nina doesn't need much mental manipulation.  She lives with her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer who babies and controls her daughter to the point of suffocation.  Nina is also mentally teased by Thomas...who tries to trick and manipulate his dancer into showing something new on stage.  To say that Nina puts tremendous pressure on herself would be an understatement.  She chews her nails and compulsively scratches herself, leaving tears in her skin.  And she sometimes sees things that aren't there.  Nina is tightly wound, neurotic and obsessive when the film begins.  As things progress, we can see, with great clarity, how she begins to lose herself more and more.    I don't want to say much more, because the journey Nina takes is fascinating.  What's amazing to me is that this movie is really a potboiler or melodrama.  It follows a clichéd path, treads familiar ground.  Yet every moment of it feels new and real and dangerous.  Director Darrin Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER) has done an amazing job of constructing the film to feel like a deep psychological study and a period thriller at the same time.  It feels like something from the `60s or `70s and like something modern and edgy at the same time.  He has chosen to film in digital video, and for once, the low budget choice works.  The film has a slight darkness and fuzziness to it that only helps the mood.    The screenwriters have also written about the details of ballet and SWAN LAKE in a way that lets viewers totally unfamiliar with the story have a good sense of what is going on.  We understand the show and what Nina is trying to achieve.  And for those many folks who say the ending is hard to figure out, I can only say, \\"you're trying too hard.\\"  It is a fascinating and gripping ending...but it is quite clear.  Don't be turned away because you think you won't be able to \\"get\\" the film.  I found it surprisingly accessible.  My 18 year-old daughter had no trouble grasping it. (Although there was enough sexuality in the film to make me uncomfortable at having brought her.)  I didn't hear people grumbling on the way out of the theater either (and the place was packed, by the way...I think this little art film is going to make some pretty decent money.)    And please don't miss it, because you'll miss some good (even great) performances.  Cassel is perfectly cast in the very clichéd role of the artistic director.  Pompous, self-centered and yet somehow alluring...we see the creative side along with his cruelty.  Hershey is frightening in her role...reminding me of Bette Davis in her BABY JANE days.  And Mila Kunis continues to tackle unexpected and challenging roles...and with BLACK SWAN, she has put her days as Jackie on THAT `70S SHOW behind her.  And Natalie Portman is a slam dunk for an Oscar nomination with her riveting performance.  She's on screen for the entire film, and must accomplish much of the dancing herself.  She looks weary, frightened, fragile, strong and dedicated.  Her work here is so accomplished and takes us on such a journey; I was exhausted by the end because the ferocity of her work gripped me so tightly.  It's easily the best female performance of the year.  For her work alone, the movie is worth seeing.  Fortunately, there's plenty else to enjoy in the gripping, highly-recommended BLACK SWAN.
0553805371|1.0|Hawking and Mlodinow's book is stupefying.  It appears to have been written by a teenager with some slight knowledge of M/String Theory and little else.  Part of the book is spent disparaging the entire past history of mankind because it did not come to a knowledge of modern physics immediately upon emerging from the proto-human stage fifty thousand or so years ago.  The authors assert (p. 181, last page) that \\"M-theory is the *only* candidate for a complete theory of the universe\\" (their italics).  This arrogant statement is certainly disputed by researchers who work on Loop Quantum Gravity, Causal Dynamical Triangulations, Domino Theory and \\"Universality\\" (or \\"anti-grand-unification\\") -- and even the view (by some computer scientists) that the universe is a cosmic computer.  While these explanations (and others yet a-borning) have not yet had the time and energy expended on them that String Theory has, it is premature at the least to exclude them from being candidates for a \\"complete theory of the universe.\\"  And by the way, M-Theory is still a long way from being \\"complete,\\" given the incompatibilities between the five different String Theories.<br />Periodically in the history of science we find various Dr. Strangeloves declaring that \\"we\\" (i.e., they) now know it all.  Look no further, because the current state of science (as known by them) has encapsulated all there is to know.  The great ones have spoken;  the small people will have to accept it on (non-religious, of course) faith.<br />Among other oddities, the book assumes that some form of gravity pre-exists the Big Bang.  How can they be so sure?  And what proof do they have that the Big Bang is not really a Big Bounce from the Big Crunch of an earlier trillion-year universe, just one cosmos in an eternal, er, \\"string\\" of universes?  Could we have some serious discussion of branes and bulk, please?  What about Misner, Thorne and Wheeler's idea (in their massive tome, \\"Gravitation\\") that the cosmogonic core of the universe is a \\"calculus of propositions\\" -- something dangerously close to the concept of (shudder) God.<br />The Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, plus a lot of other sensors still in the planning, are expected to give us much more information about nature in the years to come.  But at this stage of the game, things are beginning to look more confusing than ever.  As in many other areas of physics -- or of science in general -- the issue is not that no one can find a solution to a given question;  the issue is that there are multiple, even infinite numbers of solutions to it.  Arbitrarily choosing only one on the basis of scanty evidence can at best be called jumping to conclusions.  And the unfounded assumption that, because something is predicted by certain mathematical theories, it must automatically exist, reminds one of the idea of the luminiferous ether, which followed quite logically from one of the (wrong) assumptions of pre-relativistic, Newtonian physics.  Do the authors ever entertain the notion that perhaps some overriding factor constrains the infinite possibilities indicated by the math into a finite number of actually existing channels?  Something more like a Mind?<br />To judge from the other critiques of this book, \\"The Grand Design\\" seems to get high marks from those who have little familiarity with modern physics, but low marks from those who are knowledgeable in this area.  If novices are truly interested in String Theory/M-Theory, I suggest they start with an excellent introduction:  \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to String Theory\\" by Scientific American writer George Musser (available at Amazon.com).  They will get a lot more for their money ($11.06 before shipping) than from the science fiction of \\"The Grand Design.\\"
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|Unlike other remakes, \\"The A-Team\\" is a fantastic ride of non-stop action, hilarious comic relief and astounding special effects that come together in a perfect symphony of wonderful chaos! I loved it!
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|For a happy, feel good movie with lots of layers, intrigue, comedy, romance, hot actors, great acting, and a surprise twist don't miss this film! I am so sorry to see it get lambasted by more professional reviewers in newspapers because this movie was wonderful. It was fun and lacked any of the stupid gross body humor found in a lot of (suspense) romantic comedies these days.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|A must if you're really into Avatar.  This is a great collector's set.  I especially enjoyed the special features disk.
B003ZSI9YI|5.0|This is another great CD from Phil. Even with his hand taped fast to his drum stick, he was able to keep the songs close to original as possible.<br />The new song \\"Going Back\\" is a reflexion of his young life.<br />This is a must for the Phil Collins fan.
B000006TRV|4.0|The cd was a really good price and came very quickly.  I am pleased with my purchase.  The only thing I am concerned about is that the cd case came cracked from shipping.  It is a gift so I didn't open it yet.  It doesn't look like the crack will affect the cd playing itself though, so hopefully everything will work out for the gift receiver!
0060975768|5.0|I was a helicopter crew chief in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne (A Co. 101st Assault Helicopter Bn..the Comancheros and B Co. 158th Avn Bn...the Lancers).<br />This book is so filled with the feel, the sound, the taste of the campaign that it should be a must read for anyone wanting to experience battle on the ground.<br />I needed a bath towel for all the tears I shed during the reading.  Probably a common reaction for Vietnam vets.<br />I also saw that piece of junk movie that was made from a rough outline of the book, with some Rah-Rah Go America crap thrown in to make us all feel good about it.  Pure pablum.  The Charge up the hill?  Charlie didn't fight that way, he just faded away taking his dead if he could.<br />I've recommended this book to everyone who likes to read and wants real suspense in a non-fiction account of an incredible experience where the learning curve needed to be quick.<br />Don't miss it.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I ordered this movie from Save Money Here Only Here.  While the movie was enjoyed, my DVD player could not read it, so my husband had to play through his laptop with wires connected to the TV so that we could watch easier.    My disappointment comes from Amazon.com/Save Money Here Only Here because I sent an email on 12/2/10 asking how to go about getting a different DVD (preferrable one that my DVD player can read) and as of this date, I have not received an answer.    I will be weary about ordering anything in the future through Amazon.com.
0375842209|5.0|I couldn't begin to know how many books I have read, but this one will always stand out.  I loved it from start to finish!

0446195529|5.0|Once again, we have a thriller you cannot put down.  It rather ties up all the preceeding books and gives an ending to the Camel Club - maybe.  Never know, I guess, when they will be back in action again.  Would definitely recommend this to Baldacci fans with a 5-star rating!
B004222UCS|2.0|I remember buying this on cassette way back when and seeing the tour when it came through Connecticut. So when I bought this, it was mainly for the live cd. The live cd is from 1986. The set list is great but the sound quality is horrible! This live cd should have been remastered and cleaned up! It would have made the double cd worth the money. In my opinion, don't waste your money!
0756665949|5.0|This book is a must have for any true Lost fan.  While you may not learn a lot of new things, the pictures and descriptions certainly bring back a lot of memories.  The book itself is of nice quality and is certainly a conversation piece.
B003NFM3JK|2.0|I am not a fan of Jim Carey, but I love the story, A Christmas Carol. My family also likes the Pixel movies, however, this movie is a real disappointment.  Parts of it are o.k. but some parts are dark and eerie.  I know the ghosts are supposed to put fear in Ebeneezer's heart, but this was somewhat overkill. Jim Carey is still recognizable in spite of his portrayal of Scrooge, but I could overlook that had the movie been any good.  Love Disney, but this one fell a little short, in my opinion.
0316019984|5.0|From my point of view, this new Super Heroes pop-up book has several things going for it.  First, I am a big DC Comic fan; have been since a small lad. (I have a very modest but nice collection of \\"BlackHawk Comics,\\" my favorite, which I have collected over the years).  Secondly, I have a lot of little kid in me and delight in pop-up books of any sort.  Third, I am fascinated with shiny, colorful and complicated things like clocks, watches, toasters, chess sets and such stuff.  I probably have a lot of raccoon in me.<br /><br />Well folks, if you are like me, then this new offering is bound to delight.  It truly is a marvel!  I am fascinated with the fact that Matthew Reinhart was able to come up with the engineering dynamics of this thing...I knew he was good, but I did not realize just how good.<br /><br />When this book is released from its plastic wrapper it expands to just under four inches. (Note here that all measurements I give in this review are approximate).  This includes the heavy bound cover and five pages of pop-ups.  Now I say five pages, but there are far more three dimensional offerings than just five...more about that later.<br /><br />I will go through this page by page so the potential buyer knows precisely what they are getting...anyway, I will attempt it.<br /><br />The first double page, when you open the book is of course...who else, but Superman. His character stands just a bit over one foot tall and the man of steel's left fist reaches out a full seven inches.  He literally leaps from the page. This is the main graphic.  On each of the two pages there are two other pop-ups; one features the space craft in which the baby Superman is sent to earth in when his home planet is destroyed.  The other smaller pop-up is actually two different characters, one of Superman doing battle with the Doomsday monster and the other is our old evil friend Lex Luthor.  These smaller pop-ups stand about 2 ½ inches out from the page.  Each features a wonderful text.<br /><br />The second double page features an extremely complicated and detailed Batman answering the call of the Bat Beacon high on a tower on Gotham City. Note that the Bat Signal here, high in the sky, actually lights up!  When fully extended this big pop-up leaps approximately 10 inches from the pages.  Again, we have two smaller offerings, one on each page.  The first of the inside of the Bat Cave and the second is of the Joker.  The Joker pops-up to at least 3 ½ inches.  Again, all are accompanied by a wonderfully written text.<br /><br />The next double page spread, my favorite page in the book, is of the Warrior Goddess herself, Wonder Woman!  As you open the book she practically leaps into your lap...about 14 inches tall and expands from the page for a distance of at least seven inches.  She is clutching and twirling her golden lasso and looks as if she means business.  There are three additional pop-up graphics on these pages, the first features the famous Amazon Refuge...yes, \\"The Island!\\"  The second shows us Wonder Woman in her invisible space craft off on some mission (which is explained in the text).  The third features our Warrior Goddess doing battle with Ares...truly a scary sight to behold.  Again, all four models are accompanied by an extremely well written description.<br /><br />Next we have The Green Lanterns of Earth...all five of them in one pop-up.  The swoop from the page as if one...over one foot wide, 14 inches tall and five inches right in your face.  Good grief!  Two other additions, one on each page feature The Flash and the other Aquaman.  The colors on all of these pop-ups stay true to the originals and are quite impressive.<br /><br />As we turn the page, we are encountered with the horrible Darkseid surrounded by eight of his evil minions. Standing over one foot tall, this outrageous beast is over one foot wide and comes off the page at approximately six inches.  The two small pop-ups include Gotham's  five most wanted in one and Sinestro doing battle with the Green Lantern in another.<br /><br />The last page is...oh my...the entire Justice League of America doing battle with numerous villains.  The name count here is legend:  Adam Strange, Amzao, Aquaman, Atom-Smasher, Batman, Batwoman, Bizarro, Black Adam, Black Canary, Black Lightning, Black Manta, Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Captain Marvel, Cheetah, Chemo, Clayface, Deadman, Firestorm, The Flash, Giganta, Gorilla Grodd, Green Arrow, TGreen Lantern, Harley Quinn, The Joker, Krypto, Lex Luthor, Man-Bat, Martian Manhunter, Metallo, Metamorpho, Mister Freeze, Mongul, Nightwing, Plastic Man, Red Tornado, Scarecrow, Silver Banshee, Sinestro, Solomon Grundy, Supergirl, Superman, Wonder woman and Zoom.  The main pop up features two towers of fighting action interlinked, standing about 14 inches from the page...straight out!  Three small pop-ups feature the first mission of the Justice League, the New Generation of the Justice League and yet another of the Justice Leage together.<br /><br />Despite the complexity of this book (some of the pop-ups have three and four cards from which the figures are cut, it is quite durable.  I am not saying that it could stand extreme handling from little fingers, but this book, for what it is, is very well made.<br /><br />This book will delight the wee ones and it will delight collectors of such work.  I will be honest.  I had intended to present this work as a gift to you young 5 year old nephew...but there is little to no chance of my doing it now.  I am keeping this puppy for myself!<br /><br />As advertized, this one does have more than 25 3-D impressions and does indeed light-up with the Bat-Signal.  The cosmic Justice League of America battle scene is something to behold...to say nothing of Wonder Woman...sigh.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksr.      The last page is...oh my...the entire Justice League of America doing battle with numerous villains.  The name count here is legend:  Adam Strange, Amzao, Aquaman, Atom-Smasher, Batman, Batwoman, Bizarro, Black Adam, Black Canary, Black Lightning, Black Manta, Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Captain Marvel, Cheetah, Chemo, Clayface, Deadman, Firestorm, The Flash, Giganta, Gorilla Grodd, Green Arrow, TGreen Lantern, Harley Quinn, The Joker, Krypto, Lex Luthor, Man-Bat, Martian Manhunter, Metallo, Metamorpho, Mister Freeze, Mongul, Nightwing, Plastic Man, Red Tornado, Scarecrow, Silver Banshee, Sinestro, Solomon Grundy, Supergirl, Superman, Wonder woman and Zoom.  The main pop up features two towers of fighting action interlinked, standing about 14 inches from the page...straight out!  Three small pop-ups feature the first mission of the Justice League, the New Generation of the Justice League and yet another of the Justice Leage together.     Despite the complexity of this book (some of the pop-ups have three and four cards from which the figures are cut, it is quite durable.  I am not saying that it could stand extreme handling from little fingers, but this book, for what it is, is very well made.    This book will delight the wee ones and it will delight collectors of such work.  I will be honest.  I had intended to present this work as a gift to you young 5 year old nephew...but there is little to no chance of my doing it now.  I am keeping this puppy for myself!    As advertized, this one does have more than 25 3-D impressions and does indeed light-up with the Bat-Signal.  The cosmic Justice League of America battle scene is something to behold...to say nothing of Wonder Woman...sigh.    Don Blankenship  The Ozarks
0743289692|5.0|The book is a very comprehensive account of the condition of women under strict Islamic rule and in Africa. The book presents memoirs of Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Ayaan Hirsi Ali was born in Somalia, moved to Kenya, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Netherlands. Most of these moves were to escape from persecution of her own or her family members. Its a first hand account of the life of a women in Africa and in Islamic countries. The book is a vivid tale of various kind of brutalities women face and survival during their lifetime in these countries. There are certain sections which are graphic and make you question, if all this happened in 20th and 21st century. The author makes an important point in the book by questioning if the western governments (especially European govt.) are doing the right thing by turning their faces in another direction while witnessing atrocities on women in the name of allowing people to practice religious freedom.    She raises another interesting question which doesn't gets highlighted that much. Why is it that typically immigrants have to mingle only with people from their own country/community even in a friendly and welcoming country?  As an immigrant myself, I have always questioned if people immigrate just for the sake of reaping benefits of better economic conditions. Even when I look around I see people forming clusters with people of their own community/country. While I understand its a natural condition when you move to another place, people stick to this lifestyle even after spending their lifetimes. Is money the sole motivation for moving?     In short, its a fascinating book about her life and she does an excellent job of describing her life and condition of women in Islam. She is brave and deserves tremendous amount of respect.
0345423496|1.0|Clark's \\"3001\\" has no plot, no sense of urgency. It asks too much of the reader to accept the coincidence that Frank Poole is awakened at the same time the monolith aliens decide to exterminate humankind, and at the same time that the Bowman/HAL aka \\"Halman lifeform\\" comes into contact with Poole.<br /><br />When Poole finds out the monolith aliens are about to destroy mankind, there is no build-up to this occurrence, or suspense as he takes part in averting this disaster. It's telling, not showing.<br /><br />Majority of the book, as many readers have brought out, is just about Frank Poole being brought up-to-date in the 31st century. The dealings with the aliens are brought in for a small portion towards the end of the novel.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B0030IIYWA|1.0|Hi, I want to tell I love the movie, but I'm a little confused, beacause the Product Detail say It have 3 Language, but really only have English...<br />so for that I but one Star for not thinking in the spanish consumer.
030746363X|1.0|Manually I might add. The most absurd claim in this rehash book. Also more like abuse/torture. Coming from the author who thinks pontificating on the importance of ~eye contact on his blog is groundbreaking. Puhleeze. He obviously doesn't even get the basics between foreplay and climax but girls? Don't try this. ow[...] Tim hun, welcome to the ranks of men who had women fake it and/or women who don't understand their own bodies. Get a job. One that takes more than 4 hours work.
1878424505|5.0|Clear, simple, direct, to the point, effective, informative, transformative.  I wish I read books like this in College rather than wordy, mental explorations about the meaning of life from smart people lost in intellectual theory.    Highly recommended.
B004EKCNMA|3.0|Just another movie is all, nothing that noteworthy here. The characters seemed a bit lifeless, the pacing was too slow, and the sound equalizing was terrible (I had to constantly turn up the volume to even hear what was being said, but then turn it way down again as the sound effects and music got way too loud).
B004FPZ2KY|4.0|I downloaded the illustrated Kindle version of Pride and Prejudice for free from Amazon.  Thank you Amazon!  This is one of my favorite books and one that I have re-read several times and will read again.<br />  OK.  So you know this isn't a bitch and complain session and that I am appreciative of the freebies I have gotten from Amazon.  So here it goes, the good, bad, and the suggestions.<br />  This illustrated version of Pride and Prejudice - offered by Amazon - is beautifully formatted for the Kindle.  It is attractive and appealing and like most Kindle books is a pleasure to e-read.<br />The only problem that I can see  - or actually CAN'T see - is the muted e-ink illustrations or the text below each illustration.  Even when I zoom in on the illustration, though I can see the illustration better, I still can't read the writing :(  I have a Kindle DX (larger Kindle), so this must be a serious problem for people with regular 7 in. sized Kindles.<br />  If the e-ink problem with the nine illustrations were solved, I would gladly pay .99 cents for a copy of this partially illustrated book.  If the problem were fixed AND each of the sixty-one chapters were presented with one of the Brock illustrations, I would gladly pay $9.99 for the e-book.  And please don't tell me to buy the newer, smaller Kindle because the e-ink is sharper.  I have tested it out at the store, and though somewhat sharper, it is not sharp enough to make up for 60 year old eyes when e-ink is muted.<br />Any way, I will make due with this freebie from Amazon and keep searching the web site from time to time for the improved edition:)
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book so much. It is the most wonderful, amusing, and heart-warming book I have read in several years. There are many other reviews by now and all express opinions much better than I could.  I will say that I read the one star reviews and found them all petty and silly.  Not sure how this lovely story could have been dismissed by an entire Book Club, as one review stated.  Let me just say I'm very glad I'm not a member of that particular club!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This was an excellent purchase.  The Blu-ray, extended Collector's Edition is probably the best deal going.  The movie is so vivid in HD color and shows so much more than the first release.  Too bad a sequel is not in the making. Great story line and acting.  If you like sci-fi you will definitely love this movie.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|I found the problem with the pacific being that you cant really connect with the characters. They series prevents you from getting to know the characters because true to life alot of the marines died. with main characters continuously getting killed it was hard to get into.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I have read and listened to this book.  Both ways are great but, the audio is awesome.  I've listened to a lot of audio books and to me, they are convenient if traveling, but I much rather read the book than listen to it.  This is the exception.  The audio version of this on Audible is fantastic.  I love the interaction between Jack and his Mom.  They really did a great job when choosing who did the voices.    Either way you choose you cannot go wrong with this book.  The only negative thing I have to say, if you can even consider a negative, is that the first half of the book/audio is much better than the second half.  I kind of felt let down with their relationship.    I definitely recommend this book!
B002PMV9FG|1.0|Extremely dark transfer.  I hope WB will make a new print.  It really ruined my fun. Some scenes are so dark that you barely see the sides of the screen
030746363X|5.0|This book is kick ass. Ass I expected. I've tested out a number of Tim's experiments over the years and am stoked to put this to work. Really nails the core physical goals that most people have. Short impactful chapters. Love it!<br /><br />I recently crossed the finish line on my first barefoot ultramarathon using some of the key tenets offered up in the book.<br /><br />Hat's off to Tim for a what he's created. The world stands to benefit!<br />-Scott Dinsmore
B002ZG981E|1.0|I wanted to to really like this movie, but the plot was so self absorbed that it missed an essential point - only a twelve year old could believe such a juvenile plot.   A dream within a dream, sounds good until you realize that is what most people deal with every morning.  This movie left me with one thought, Hollywood is really dominated with simple minded fools that cannot get over special effects and actually write a story that keeps an adults attention.  Don't buy or rent this movie, I was do disappointed that I actually spent money on this piece of crap.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|First of all, you need to know that I very much enjoyed [[ASIN:B00005OCMR Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)]] when it came out back in 1982 - I think I saw it three times in two days when I first saw it (this was in the days before everyone had video players), and I have seen it several times since.  I was mesmerized with TRON (1982) and the fact tht it was the first feature length film to rely entirely on digital effects.  I guess you could say that I'm a TRON fan.  What this means is that I had very high expectations when I went to see TRON:Legacy in the theater.<br /><br />For overall chic, coolness, and sci-fi fun, I put this film on par with STAR TREK (2009).  Plus, it's rated PG - totally watchable!<br /><br />What I can tell you without revealing anything about the storyline is that watching the movie was more of an overall experience for the senses than just an action movie.  There were fantastic effects, but the effects did not overwhelm or drive the story, and the techno-music from Daft Punk was a perfect match to the digital world of the web.  TRON: Legacy wasn't at all like the somewhat unsatisfying experience I had with Star Wars III - which was a major dose of digital candy with little else to offer.<br /><br />Anyway, TRON: Legacy had an interesting premis stemming from TRON (1982), had many interesting connections to that older film if you know what to look for, e.g., Dumont's garage, \\"That is a big door\\", etc.  Jeff Bridges was fantastic, the special effects were gripping, the action was engaging, and the acting was quite good.  I think that this film was better or at least on par with other good recent films I've seen, e.g., Avatar, Sherlock Holmes, etc.  It's not a non-stop adrenaline rush, but it's a good mix of action, thoughtfulness, great effects, and memorable characters.<br /><br />This is definitely a 5-star show for sci-fi fans, and a 4-star offering for action adventure fans.  Since I like sci-fi, I give it a strong 5-star rating.
030746363X|5.0|The book is a great dose of of advice, stories, and strategies to transform yourself.  I've already ordered my Kettlebells and am easing into the diet.  I had all prepared to begin spending thousands on personal training and gyms! I've put it all on hold! This guide gives relatively easy strategies that take the minimum effort to achieve amazing results..and I can now hold my breath for 3 minutes!!

B000002KHF|5.0|Van's second album released in 1970 could hardly be more different than his first, the seminal `Astral Weeks' from 1968. As an original musical masterpiece AW is universally recognised as something unique and special; however, `Moondance' is a mellower, more mature offering, less demanding and insistent. In the past 40 years it has been played and enjoyed by millions throughout the world who appreciate its timeless excellence, and it continues to win new generations of appreciative fans with each passing decade. The songs here are more structured, more accessible, and stand on their own as separate pieces. Many have been covered by other artists, but none of these covers comes close to the magic of Van's original recordings.<br /><br />The album is an exemplary collection of beautiful pieces, with styles ranging from jazzy (the title track) to rocky up-tempo (Running to me), to midnight romantic-mood piece (Crazy Love), gospel-themed with backing choir (Brand New Day) to the sublime (Into the Mystic). Every song is good, and they fit together seamlessly to make for a special listening experience. You can listen to `Moondance' every day just about anywhere, anytime and you will never tire of it: this is rare indeed.<br /><br />The powerful, restless dynamism of Van's voice, bursting with the passionate intensity of youth, together with visionary lyrical writing elevates some of these songs to timeless greats. There is no trace here of the bland, the formulaic or mundane. Van is a true original, and if `Moondance' were his only career recording he would still win entry to the Hall of Fame. That a consistency of excellence and increasing mastery of musical form is evident throughout his 40-year career puts him right up there in the top 10 musical innovators of the past 50 years: talented, hard to categorise, versatile, eclectic, respected, unique.<br /><br />If you're serious about music and interested in the best, you should probably have `Moondance' in your collection.n.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Celebrated our Christmas this weekend and my son was thrilled with his gift of \\"Avatar (three-disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD-Live) (Blu-ray).    Ordering on Amazon was very easy and it was received in great time.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I'm a 70 year old man, who has read thousands of books in my life time. Over the years I have learned to keep two books on hand. One book, I call my sleeper book,I use this book to to read myself to sleep.The other book is one I don't dare read, \\"if I want to get any sleep\\". In the last 10 years or so, most of my reading books have become sleeper books. I think this has more to do with my age then the caliber of the books.<br /><br />I just ordered the third book of the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy.  \\"I'M GOING TO GET SOME SLEEP AFTER I FINISH THEM\\"<br /><br />Paul

B00004RF8J|5.0|I've been searching for this movie for awhile now.  This was my favorite childhood movie. I used to walk around the house singing just like the girls in the movie. lol. Now I get a chance to share it with my little girl.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I bought this gps antenna about a month ago for my toshiba laptop computer and i have to say that it is far better than the other one that i had. I highly recommend this antenna if you are a trucker with GPS software on a laptop. I have microsoft mappoint software and this antenna really makes this software run properly.The position updates for this antenna are alot faster than any gps antenna that i have used before,and the positioning is extremely accurate.
B003VS0CXS|4.0|Color and sound track okay.  I viewed on an new Sony 40 inch digital HD TV.  Tried all the variousl options for the Screen settings but never was able to get the picture to look normal.  The picture always looked squished down or stretched out regardless of the screen settings I tried.  So, I do not know if this is the Blue-ray DVD recording or my TV settings.  I have not viewed the normal DVD version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as of this date.  Highly recommend the DVD 2 disc package for all ages of the family.  It is a Dick Van Dyke classic.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|This album is crap.  She is not a lyricist at all.  Some of the tracks are nice but, maybe they should have had a real lyrical talent rap on them?  I know, she is only a fun rapper, not one who has something valid to say.  So if it's just suppose to be fun then, I guess it's okay for teeny boppers.  Anyone who likes real lyrics will shoot their brains out listening to this mess.  She's cute but no lyrical skills whatsoever.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The innocent voice of the 5-year-old is poignant, the unwavering love of the mother is selfless. Room is a crater that left one having unsettling thoughts. Room is about the bond of the mother and child is so strong and divine that provides hope for a new beginning. Innocent and powerful, unique yet not straying from normalcy, beautiful and heart wrenching at times. A remarkable piece of work.
