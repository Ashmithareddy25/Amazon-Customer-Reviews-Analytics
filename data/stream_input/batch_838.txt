0142412147|5.0|So this is what it feels like to be in love with a book...<br /><br />Best thing for me about this collection? How all the stories overlap slightly. Characters from the first story show up in the second, characters from the second are in the third etc. The authors have put together their heads and created a world that all of their characters could live in, and I loved it! I also loved getting the  chance to read stories by Maureen Johnson and Lauren Myracle for the first time, it definitely will not be the last time! Now onto the individual stories..<br /><br />Maureen Johnson's, The Jubilee Express starts like a normal day, a girl (Jubilee) waiting at home for her parents to arrive and looking forward to getting to spend the evening with her boyfriend. It quickly steers off course and Jubilee finds herself stuck on a train going nowhere with a group of cheerleaders (she HATES cheerleaders). She makes her way off the train and that's when the adventure really begins...<br /><br />John Green's, A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle also starts like any ordinary winter day. Three friends are enjoying a Bond marathon until they receive a call that they must get down to the Waffle House to partake in the oogling of some cheerleaders. This would just be a typical guys being guys story except one of these three friends happen to be a girl (and she's not in it to oogle any cheerleaders). Their journey through a huge snowstorm to see the cheerleaders ends up stirring up some hidden feelings between two of the friends...<br /><br />Lauren Myracle's, The Patron Saint of Pigs, centers around Addie who, when in a confused and drunken state makes a mistake and because of it loses her boyfriend. She spends some time feeling bad for herself but is forced to get back to the daily grind at Starbucks. Through a series of events she learns a little something about herself...<br /><br />So if I had to choose, I'd pick John Green's story as my favorite. But I like to look at it one big story! This is a great book, especially for this time of year! It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! I think it's a great way to get introduced to some of the biggest names in young adult literature!is time of year! It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!

B001BTG3OQ|4.0|I purchase this to supplement my SB-600 and love the flash.  It's a little big but not too bad.  Mounts well on my D90, but I wouldn't want to put in on a D40/60 sized camera.  The case is HUGE and is why I give it only 4 stars.  It does have room for the diffuser, stand, filters, etc, but it doesn't fit in my current camera bag.  Flash power and features including the new style display and redesigned power switch including the ability to easily go into remote and master modes is great.  Build quality is good, but my SB-600 does seem a little more solid.  Because of the flash size and size of the case, I tend to carry the SB-600 more and just use the SB-900 around the house, but I do recommend the SB-900.
B0017ANAZO|2.0|Director/screenwriter Diane English's 2008 update of George Cukor's [[ASIN:B0008ENICU 1939 MGM classic comedy]] unfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites, the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead, because of English's thematic overreach, the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit. What's more, the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcom-level stereotypes in this movie, and the original play's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930's. To add insult to injury, the recent big screen adaptation of HBO's [[ASIN:B001DDBCUU Sex and the City]] did this sort of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs.<br /><br />The skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like \\"Sex and the City\\", she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful, cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of Miranda Priestly in [[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada]] (yet another film this echoes); perennially pregnant Edie Cohen representing the stay-at-home wife; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. Through a mouthy manicurist, they find out Mary's husband is having an affair with man-eater Crystal Allen, a perfume girl at Saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress. The rest of the plot doesn't matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering, none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie.<br /><br />Looking strangely youthful at 47, Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990's with [[ASIN:B000XJD33O When Harry Met Sally...]] and [[ASIN:B0000AOV4I Sleepless in Seattle]]. It's not that she isn't age-appropriate here, but her familiar sprightliness seems at odds with the character's passive nature. Annette Bening fares somewhat better in the scene-stealing Rosalind Russell role of Sylvie because she has proven to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability, but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress' performance severely. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow, transparent shopgirl versus the smart, hard-edged cookie Joan Crawford got to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are scooted way to the sidelines as Edie and Alex, respectively. Much better are Candice Bergen as Mary's savvy, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the non-nonsense housekeeper.<br /><br />Probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film's release, the 2008 DVD doesn't have a robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girls' night-in as a contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a multi-married Hollywood agent counseling Mary during a late night at a yoga camp. Two featurettes round out the extras - \\"The Women: The Legacy\\" about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play, and \\"The Women Behind the Women\\" which has cast and crew speak endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-image. The irony is that this version of \\"The Women\\" directed and scripted by a woman takes such a patronizing look at women.without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie.

B00007K02F|5.0|I have to admit that I have been a Mr. Rochester/Jane Eyre fan since I was a teenager.  I have read the book for school and  many times over since then and still go back to it.  When I found William Hurt playing Mr. Rochester, that just added all the spice I needed to enjoy this lovely book/movie.    Jane Eyre is a poor, helpless child who is mistreated and deceived and sent to a home for girls.  She grows up to be a governess and falls in love with her employer.  On her wedding day she finds out that he is married and she leaves him without preamble.  She returns to be by his side in the end and understands his story.    Everyone has a story even the people we think are high and mighty and untouchable.  This is a never ending love story for women everywhere.  The book is a must too.
0767020308|5.0|This movie, although not my favorite of Jane Austin's work, was still a wonderful movie! Compared to the other Emma adaptation, this one was more historically correct. In the one with Paltrow, some of the costumes looked very ridiculous and some of them you wouldn't wear in the regency era.<br /><br />True to some posts I did feel as if Mr. Knightly was a little hard to get to know, but besides that, I thought all the actors did very well. All in all, this is the best adaptation of Emma so far!

B0018CWEYY|4.0|The whole collection...gotta have em!  This was a GREAT buy....it was a shorter season, so disappointed that it's a much smaller package, and they filled it with many extras I don't care to watch so much for my money.  But I guess the price did help reflect that disadvantage too....so I'm not complaining.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|This was a fantastic movie set to watch.  It really makes you think how the originals would have been redone to todays technologies.  My movies never showed up when they were supposed too so AMAZON stepped up to the plate and mailed me a new box set that I had in only days.  They really stand behind there service and thats why I only buy from them!!!  Great movie and keep up the good work AMAZON!!!
0937381888|5.0|I was a first time brewer when purchasing this book and it allowed me to browse the pages and get my first batch under my belt in no time.  From there it provides enough information to let the brewer(s) experiment on their own.  The book gives great tips on what aspects of the ingredient's weights and time addition give the beer its characteristics, allowing you to really create multiple beers from the same recipe just by varying simple time additions during the brew.    A MUST for any home brewer looking to refine their process.
B00005JO20|4.0|Peter Jackson's labour of love is a spectacular, if overlong, remake of the movie that filled him with wonder as a small boy and inspired him to become a film maker. He may play fast and loose with the viewer's ability to suspend disbelief, giving us, as he does, indestructible people who are impossibly lucky when avoiding being trampled and can strafe their entire surroundings with machine-gun fire and only hit the monsters, but this is OK because it's part of the film's glorious sense of fun. And there may be plenty of ripe dialogue and facial contortion but Jackson puts so much heart into his production that this is perfectly in keeping with the tone of the work. Jackson has made a thrilling homage to the original Hollywood blockbuster, while successfully maintaining the emotional core of the plot. Self-indulgent it may be but it's all the better for that.

B000002J1S|5.0|If you want to hear the real Genesis, at its finest, as opposed to the Phil Collins hit machine, look no further. \\"The Lamb\\" marked the apogee of Genesis before the split of Peter Gabriel as the trademark Genesis sound died in a morass of top hits after \\"Trick of the Tail\\" and \\"Wind and Wuthering.\\" Both albums are both worth picking up as eventually Steve Hackett left as well, marking the end of Genesis as a progressive rock band that could stand up to Yes, and signaling the end of the creative input to the music by Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, thus leaving virtually all the songwriting to Phil Collins.<br /><br />\\"The Lamb\\" is as ambitious a musical project as any before or since, and ranks right up with the Who's \\"Quadrophenia\\" and \\"Tommy,\\" Yes's \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans,\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall, although it is probably more ambitious and certainly much more sophisticated musically speaking than the Who or Pink Floyd, without being as ponderous as the Yes effort. The rhythm section of Collins and Rutherford proved that it could easily compete with Alan White and Chris Squire of Yes for sheer rhythmic intricacy and breath-taking bass runs, while Tony Banks and Steve Hackett wove ambitious melodies on top, as Peter Gabriel's vocals and evocative lyrics told a story and created psychic landscapes worthy of De Chirico and Dali. This album is a true must have for any true fan of progressive rock.

B001ILHY1I|3.0|Death Race (Unrated Edition) (Unrated Edition DVD) was released in 2008-12-21 and contains some scenes which are wasn't in the Theathrical release.  The back cover of DVD tells that there is additional 6 min in Unrated version, but there is no any list of what exactly was added.  Here is the list of these additions made by comparing of two versions. Feel free to correct it.    Only significant changes:    1. Scene at the steel mill where the cops come features Jensen egging them on as they attack his fellow coworkers.    2. Cafeteria scene shows the spit actually hitting Jensen's food. Small scene afterward of Ulrich leading Jensen to the Warden's office, telling him that the Warden punishes prisoners \\"who mess with her drivers.\\"    3. The fate of Jensen's cell mates. (You don't actually see anything happen, just sound effects)    4. Small 15 second scene of Case giving details on how the buttons work during the race: \\"All four wheels must hit the button at the same time.\\"    5. The machine guns stop working on the front of the Mustang and Case hangs out the window, hitting them with a wrench as the other cars shoot at her. (Probably the longest scene removed from the theatrical release)    6. A few cuts of Grimm's car interior logrolling before it gets launched into the air.    7. Quick cuts of the napalm flames engulfing Travis Colt before his car blows.    8. When Jensen initially attacks Pachenko, he admits that Hennessey and Ulrich did it, and we see a sort of flashback to him and Ulrich sitting in a car watching Jensen step out of the bus.    9. Case make small talk and asks Jensen what his real name is as the two modified Death Race cars speed across the Terminal Prison bridge.    Nothing really significantly different. A little more extended, but not by much, and nothing really improved upon as far as being more-violent and showing more gore than the theatrical release.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Awesome CD! Taylor is a great writer and I like this CD better than her first one.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I bought the JTTDOTE DVD the day it came out and returned the next day.    I only bought it for the novelty of the 3D and was astonished at color shifts during shots, only seldom working 3D and the ugly colors it produces. Truly awful.    I saw it in a theater and I think this new 3D is in big trouble if theater owners insist on diming their projectors to save money on bulbs. It was so dark, thanks also to the polaroid sunglasses that must decrease the light by at least two stops (camera reference) I hope Cameron's Avator 3D epic doesn't have this problem.    Spy Kids 3D works much better.    I can't recommend it. And boy am I disapointed.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|I love this CD! It's a great dance CD and the slow songs are good too.
0767830555|3.0|This movie is very powerful and is certainly deserving of its Top 100 AFI rating.  This is the story of madness and the slow decent into criminal violence that it leads Taxi Driver Bickle when he sees it as the only way out of a hopeless situation.  Loneliness can be a terrible thing to deal with and while most people struggle with it and choose a more conventional and healthy solution others with mental illness or who are prone to it \\"choose\\" different paths that may lead to self-destruction or as in the case of Travis Bickle, vigilante-ism and taking the law into his own hands to set things \\"right.\\"  The lonely angry psychopath who reacts in this way is the ticking time bomb that unfortunately is almost never recognised until the effects of their madness come to fruition e.g. the Unabomber etc.  DeNiro does an excellent job in portraying this individual and is genuinely scary in his role; even scarier is the realisation that perhaps at some point in our lives the vast majority of us have at least contemplated taking things into our own hands and so to some extent perhaps even identify and even find ourselves rooting for Travis.  The violent end may have shocked 70s audiences and you get the sense that Scorcese even toned it down a little for fear of a public backlash but it's interesting to me that as violence in film has been getting worse and worse over the years, I felt that it was pretty tame given what we are exposed to these days e.g \\"Kill Bill\\", \\"Blade\\" etc and I thought the final scenes were not violent enough relative to today's films.  Ironically, Bickle is treated as a hero and is not punished for his murders in the end which is also interesting as this ticking time bomb is released into the streets in an ominous ending which leaves us expecting a sequel of some sort.  I would like to see a Director's Cut of this movie and to see how Scorcese would \\"modernise\\" this brilliant film for today's audiences.  In my opinion, this is the best film since \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" to expose the seady side of the 70s New York City underbelly although it is just as powerful a film for its impact on its audience.<br /><br />This dvd version of the film though is a bit of a mixed bag as although the picture and sound quality have been cleaned up the sound quality in 2 channels isn't very good and I'm glad that in the newer 2-Disc and upcoming Blu-ray versions you'll get the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound option which I hope sounds much better than what we get here.  The picture quality isn't perfect as a few frames here and there have spots and other imperfections on them but I thought it was done well enough to not detract from the overall viewing enjoyment.  The Special Features includes a good making-of documentary with interviews with Scorcese and the cast.<br /><br />Overall this is a great study into the lone, crazed anti-hero and is certainly one of the better films that I've ever seen.  You may however want to give this particular dvd version a miss and go instead for either the Blu-ray or the other 2-disc standard version with the improved sound quality.<br /><br />Updated 1 July 2011: 4 stars.<br /><br />Amazon won't let me review this separately and so I'll do it here.  The blu-ray release of this wonderful Scorcese classic is a treat for fans as it certainly improves upon the dvd release that I reviewed above.  The digipak packaging with a number of colour postcards is very nice.  The all important picture and sound quality have also improved a great deal although the picture quality isn't perfect as there is still excessive grain in some parts especially in the scene in the brothel when DeNiro first speaks with Foster as well as in other spots but it is still an improvement over the dvd.  The sound quality is now in excellent surround mode and is the aspect most improved over the dvd version.<br /><br />Not perfect picture quality-wise but still worth the double-dip.<br /><br />Recommended!ht Cowboy\\" to expose the seady side of the 70s New York City underbelly although it is just as powerful a film for its impact on its audience.

0061150142|5.0|I purchased this book and once I began to read it I couldn't put it down. It was a page turner. I wanted to know how it ended but I had to wait until the end..I can't flip to the back!!! The endeing was good but Picoult leaves you with some lingering questions that you had hoped were answered in the story.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|It takes a couple of listens to get into this. But maybe some Pink fans won't get into this much at all.<br /><br />I somehow did.<br /><br />I think I enjoy the underrated spunk of *ONE FOOT WRONG* most. It's very experimental sounding....kinda classic rock or something. And I'm not a big fan of classic rock but it sounds awesome. Very vibe-ish. Great vocal work.<br /><br />I must say the production on this album is top notch though. Other favorites are the Electro pop of *SO WHAT*, the sincerity of *I DON'T BELIEVE YOU* and the dire need to express her exhaust with the world in *AVE MARY A*.<br /><br />The only throwaway track to me is *CRYSTAL BALL*. Kinda slow and just boring.<br /><br />4 stars.<br /><br />end note: The big thing about this album is yeah, it's kinda the divorce album so there's a lot of that break up stuff, but it's also a very slow album. There are 5 upbeat tracks at most out of the 12. But it's good if you give it a chance. You might not love it the first listen through.<br /><br />But it's more consistent than Beyonce's new album.
0446693804|1.0|After reading \\"The Divide\\" I was expecting something more from Nicholas Evans.  This was such a disappointment.  I don't enjoy books written in first person, so after a couple of chapters I jumped to the back and even the finish was slow.  A waste of money.........
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I got HBO to watch 'True Blood' because I liked the books so much.  I canceled my HBO subscription at the end of the season.  I only kept it as long as I did because I could not get enough of Alexander Skarsgard, who plays Eric.  ( He was also fantastic in 'Generation Kill'. )  He and Pam are what got the 2 stars.      The personalities of most of the characters are changed from the books, and mostly not for the better.  Sookie, the main character of the books, has been warped into a bi-polar nightmare by the writers and mostly over-acted by Paquin. Important parts of the vampire mythology from the books have been left out and instead we get the \\"V\\" story line and the illogical \\"tribunal\\".  Some great moments from the books are in the show but without the \\"glue\\" that tied them together the story often seems schizophrenic.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|The movie itself is very touching, the robots really had personality. It's amazing to me what simple things the robots would do to give them character. There are several themes in the movie which are serious, the future of the earth with all the garbage we produce and people caring for other people and wanting to have someone to love. The supplemental material was also very entertaining. I don't often watch them but with Wall E I did. It is also presented in HD. The quality of the video and audio matched the movie. A must have.
0823023494|5.0|have been waiting for the book for a very long time, well i should it has been worth it. if you have no idea how to create a character and shape it give it the characteristics you must buy this book because this is a really easy to understand and follow book in order to learn character creation and design..
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|This was the worst movie that I have ever seen. It was so bad, that it was painful to watch. I can't understand how you can gather some of the best actors on the planet, with some of the best music ever produced, and not be able to come up with even three minutes of watchable film. ?????<br />I could have picked random people off of the street, had them write their own tunes, and film it on a camcorder, and I swear that it would have been more interesting than this unbelievably horrifying excuse for a film. And this has to be said: Anybody who liked this movie must be so insanely starved for entertainment that they'd be amused by watching a plant grow.
0956031609|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Shamim has such developed characters and I love how she writes one chapter through one persons point of view, then the following in another, it really helps to understand what is going on.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift's sophomore album's main subjects surround boys, love, and heartbreak and I haven't been able to stop listening ever since November, when it came out. A few songs take some time to grow on you, but eventually It's definitely worth your time. She's also an amazing songwriter that most can relate to.     Fearless  (10/10)  Pretty Catchy. Good Song. It's about not being afraid to just jump into a relationship.    Fifteen (9/10) This song is about her freshman year in high school, and realizing that dating the boy on the football team isn't everything. And that there are more important things in life. It warns younger girls not to fall too deep. This song takes a while to sink in.    Love Story (9/10) This song is extremely popular. I love this song because it's so creatively written with the story of Romeo and Juliet.  I rated it as 9 out of 10 because it's a bit over-played.    Hey Stephen (11/10) This song is amazing!!! I love this song. It is definitely one of my favorites and her laugh is adorable. It is about a boy that she is infatuated with. \\"Cause' I can't help it, if you look like an angel, can't help it, if I wanna' kiss you in the rain, so.\\"    White Horse (8/10) A disappointment and pain due to a guy. \\"It's too late for your white horse, to catch me now...\\"    You Belong With Me (9/10) I can really relate to this song, which is about a guy who you know belongs with you and whom you know better than his girlfriend, but he still doesn't realize it.     Tell Me Why (9/10 ) I love the intro. She's questioning him about why he had to treat her this way and hurt her. \\"You tell me that you love me, then cut me down.\\"    You're Not Sorry (9/10) She wrote this song herself, and the title says it all.    The Way I Loved you (9/10)     Forever and Always (10/10) A song about her ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas about how she thought he meant it when he said forever and always, but it ended bitterly... and she wonders if he meant it at all.    The Best Day (9/10) Atribute to her family. I used to skip this one, until I finally caught on to it. It's very sweet.    Change (7/10) Even though this song was a single, I actually don't like this song...I find that it's okay.      Even though she's not exactly a powerhouse, Fearless is one of the best albums I've heard this year.
0375424474|5.0|This book was a wonderful introduction to the subjects of evolution and paleontology.  Shubin writes this book in a highly readable and exciting manner.  One might expect books on these subjects to be somewhat staid, yet Shubing makes them very exciting.  You will learn just how to closely related all life forms really are.  While humans' relationship to other primates is now obvious, you will see how some of our body parts are simply performing other functions in other species, and how this explains why, for example, eyesight and hearing problems are so often connected.  This book makes want to read more on these subjects, and for me rather conclusively dispels \\"creationism\\".  I also admire the author for being such a polymath.  While academics, especially in the sciences, have a reputation for being so pigeonholed that they know nothing, Shubin is a paleontologist, museum administrator, evolutionary scholar, amateur geologist, who also is knowledgeable enough about human anatomy to teach medical students!  The only \\"downside\\", if you can see as that, is that the author assumes his readers have completed at least some basic college level science courses, but I feel that even those who haven't done those can easily follow this book.

0743298039|5.0|If you are someone who enjoys sitting by the fireplace and reading Jane Eyre, if you simply love literature and words, you will like this novel.    It is the story of a reclusive author who decides she finally wants an authorized biography.  Her relationship with the author she picks for the job, the story she tells, and the author's own investigation of the truth of the story, this constitutes the plot.    Character development is excellent, as are the descriptions of the English countryside.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|I thought it couldn't be done. This is not the era of Lloyd, or Fields or Laurel and Hardy. It's not the era of Capra or Preston. 99% of modern comedies suck badly, and or are mean spirited.    But miracle of miracles, someone current, finally made an hilarious movie with a heart as big as \\"You Can't Take it With You!\\"     Credit here goes not to the very good cast but stunningly to the writer/directors: Michael Arndt - Screenwriter, co directed by Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris.    Brilliant, and wise. Not just a movie about dysfunctional, it's a movie where looser are shown to be the winners they really are, just for surviving, like all of us. Not a moment of saccharine either. It sharp and intelligent.    Beautiful, beautiful movie from beginning to end, and what an ending!
0061122416|5.0|With so many reviews(1,299 and counting) there is little to add for recommending this book. What I don't understand is why there are so many haters? This is a book of fables that has a positive message. Seek your personal legend, be the best you can be, don't be afraid to take chances and enjoy the ride good or bad , in your quest in life.  This beautifully simply written book is not fitting or worthy of disparaging remarks. I was given this book to read with love and in turn gave it to someone I love to read. The circle is complete for now until someone else is given this exqusite book of truths that carry a powerful message to read. Recommended for seekers of truth and light but not for those who drink haterade.
B0014Z4P6U|5.0|I already own this movie on DVD and have seen it in HD via HD Cable.     Regardless of whether or not this title needs to be imported from the UK bears very little importance on it's price.     I mean, personally, I will never, ever spend more than $22.00 on a blu-ray title unless it's some sort of special collectors 2 or 3 disc edition. And even then, it has to be a title I REALLY, REALLY need to have in my collection.     If any blu-ray title doesn't fall below $20.00, I simply won't own it on blu-ray. It's amazing how the HD DVD version is priced at $17.00.  They didn't need to import that one?     Most Blu-ray titles, especially the older ones are somewhere between $19.00 and some even as little as $12.00. I will rebuild my entire collection of over 500 DVD's with Blu-ray  ---- as long as the prices stay affordable.     This movie, however, is truly a masterpiece. It took two viewings for me to appreciate it to that extent. My first viewing was interrupted and there were a lot of distractions. By my third viewing, I was saying to myself, \\"This movie really IS almost as good as \\"Bladerunner\\". It's personal taste, I guess. But if you like Sci-fi served up with great acting, and an even BETTER story, this is the movie for you.

B0010X8NF0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie with its quirkiness--three brothers with serious, yet goofy looks on their faces, and silly antics, is fun to watch.    Francis nearly died in a motorcyle accident (Owen Wilson), and now is examining the importance of his life. Forever playing the role of bossy, big brother, he convinces his younger brothers to join him on a spiritual journey in India to reconnect and become close, like they used to be. He also has a hidden motive to reconnect to their vanishing mother who lives as a nun in India after their father's death (Angelica Huston). Much of the movie happens on this train called the Darjeeling Limited, winding throughout the exotic countryside of India.    Jack (Jason Schwartzman) always walks around barefooted, in a suit; Peter (Adrian Brody) wears his deceased father's sunglasses, with the prescription still in them; Francis walks around with a head full of gauze bandages, with one fancy, black shoe on, and one street-bought, moccasin-like shoe on (after getting one of his $3000 shoes stolen from an Indian shoe-shine boy).    Their journey is one of forever getting into trouble on the train, and glimmers of self-discovery--one heroic deed, resulting in life-and-death, offers the brothers a good look at themselves.       The tossing away of the precious, yet burdensome luggage seems also symbolic of lugging around \\"extra baggage\\". In the end, the brothers toss it all behind themselves, showing the importance of freeing oneself from ludicrous amounts of materialistic excess.    Like the brothers, we are all on that long, winding journey of figuring out who we are and why we do the crazy things that we do. In the end, maybe the brothers have tossed out extra junk, mind-dulling drugs and all, but still--the goofy bad boys that they are--go out for a smoke and a drink.     Seemingly more trusting, the brothers seemed to have a new appreciation of each other. Was this trip a great awakening and life changing experience? Perhaps, but the ending is not \\"happily ever after\\" which is OK by me.
B000002UZ1|1.0|Well, it is December 22 and I still have not received this cd. I ordered it on November 18, it says it shipped on the November 25. I tried to contact the seller and never heard from them. What else can I say.
1433502410|5.0|I've had my NIV Study Bible since the early 1990's. My parents got it for me and it has become one of my favourite Bibles. In seminary I used it profusely since I was convinced the \\"dynamic equivalence\\" model of translation theory was the best one. I did not like the NASB (a popular edition when I was in seminary) as it seemed rather wooden in places. There were places I was not thrilled with the NIV but I was happy with it for the most part. And I really enjoyed the study notes.    Then, something rather amazing happened! Well, actually something rather common happened. Another study bible was released. This was the ESV study bible. I had only briefly looked at the ESV and thought it to be similar enough to the NASB that I really did not give it a second look. But so many people were coming to embrace it that I thought it should be something I should look at. And now since seminary I review many books, I can get most books I ask for to review, so I asked Crossway for a copy of the ESV study bible. All I can say is that this is my new favourite Bible!    The ESV itself takes a more literal approach to translation theory than I have preferred but makes valuable improvements in both the weaknesses of the NASB and the NIV. Where the NASB was overly wooden, the ESV is much smoothers. Where the NIV took too much liberty in interpretation, the ESV is more literal. I feel the ESV strikes a nice balance between both the NASB and the NIV. It is solidly conservative and easy to read. If I had to pick a new favourite translation, I think I am leaning more and more from the NIV to the ESV. But, what about the study notes? I had become accustomed to the ones in the NIV so the ESV had some hard work to convert me. At least I thought it did. Instead, it took less than a minute.    My only complaint at the outset is the paper that most bibles use in hardcover editions (the one I was sent). It is very thin and hard to turn the pages and can tear easily. In leather editions this is not as much of an issue, but this is my main issue with the hardcover edition.    The first thing that struck me about the study bible is the incredible amount of resources it contains. It contains 66 articles and essays ranging from topics on the Trinity, Bioethics, Reading the Bible as Literature, the Septuagint, and a History of Salvation in the Old Testament. These resources written by major Evangelical scholars are weighty but succinct providing just the right amount of helpful information that satisfy's the questions but prompts the reader for further study.    The next thing that strikes you is the full colour maps and illustrations. No study Bible I have ever had had full colour anything unless you count the maps that are put at the back of the bible. But every illustration and map throughout the bible is in full colour. This makes things really stand out and provides nice clear pictures to help aid in the study process.     When it comes to the notes themselves they are very thorough and balanced. They list major options of interpretation and usually let the reader decide. One of the most helpful items in the notes are what I will call the contextual notes. These, with a slight highlight, outline the sections in the text and give helpful brief notes focusing on the context of individual sections. So, not only are individual verses parsed specifically and given helpful specific information but even whole sections are given notes to help facilitate reading the text as a piece of literature. This helps the readers see the big picture of how each individual section fits into the work as a whole.     Before each book there is a helpful treatment of authorship, dating, and other common features. What sets the ESV apart from others are the literary features section which help to explain what is going on overall in the book and the history of salvation summary which put the content of the book in the context of the redemption story of the whole Scripture. This is avery helpful addition as it helps to put into context the book as a whole and helps to prevent moralizing the text but instead interpreting it in light of the rest of Scripture.    Obviously each note cannot be critiqued here in a brief review like this, but one will be looked at which always seems to generate much discussion, and that is the nature of the millennium in Revelation 20. Under Revelation 20:1-6 it describes this as \\"Interlude: The Thousand Years of the Dragon's Binding and the Martyrs' Reign.\\" Each of the premillennial, postmillennial, and amillennial, positions are described and represented fairly. It highlights different approaches to the next (literal versus symbolic) and the representative features of each position. The notes do not take a position on the issue but helpfully simply say, \\"Likewise, each of these views falls within the framework of historic Christian orthodoxy\\" (p. 2492). This is the sort of congenial attitude we need to have when discussing issues of debate that are not part of the fundamentals of the faith. While obviously this reviewer would take a particular position, he appreciates how fairly his position is described and would not hesitate to recommend this particular note to those of any eschatological persuasion.    Overall, I find the ESV study bible to be probably the best study bible on the market. Obviously, please continue to use your other study bible's but if I was to recommend just one, I would highly recommend the ESV Study Bible. Now I just have to wait to get my hands on the Black Genuine Leather edition!

B000Q66PXE|5.0|I purchased both seasons of Rome as a Christmas gift for my non-history buff husband (well, actually because I wanted it).  Both of us loved it!  The production values are gorgeous, the actors do a spendid job of creating the characters, and the special features, especially All Roads Lead to Rome, are informative and add much to the experience.<br /><br />Other reviewers have addressed the historical accuracy of the series so let me just say that we didn't care about the accuracy.  We did some research on a few subjects that interested us, and found that on the whole, the series was accurate.  As far as portraying the customs and mores of one of our parent civilizations, Rome did an excellent job of conveying the social and political climate that incubated Christianity.  I can't recommend it highly enough--great stories, great acting, great costuming, great sets--what more could you ask?

031606792X|3.0|From the previous reviews posted, I can clearly see that fans of the Twilight Series clearly either loved or despised this book. Why is this split so apparent? Fans - you have to keep in mind that this book is meant to mature with the readers, as everyone seems to have issues with the sex and graphic birthing scene. People also love a good tragedy and this was not in the case in this happy ending, perhaps too sugary sweet for those who were expecting tears and the death of an established character. So, without further introduction, lets explore the issues which divided the fans of this fourth establishment of Stephanie Meyer's beloved series:     Edward and Bella's scene of copulation is a particular plot point which sent mothers in a frenzy and adult reader's disappointed that Meyer \\"faded to black\\" when the newly married couple went for their midnight swim. Lingerie and broken bed posts angered a lot of Twilight parents, but it is nothing compared to what we find on Gossip Girl and Sex and the City - and believe me, your daughters have seen it whether they admit it to you or not. Intimacy is a part of life, and I thought Meyer explored it in a tasteful way. While the subject of teenage sex is something that many parents wish would disappear, one cannot ignore that  it happens and we have been waiting for three books for Edward and Bella to finally have a chance to be together physically. Of course, I would not let my 8 or 9 year old daughter to read this - but at 12 or 13 she should know at least SOMETHING about sex. Waiting until she is 18 is ridiculous and unnecessary. Edward and Bella deserved to express their love in a physical manner and they were married, after all. You also have to keep in mind...this is fantasy. I am 20 years old, and I know that getting married and having a child now would hinder my dreams of pursuing my education and career...but in Bella's world anything is possible. She was meant to be a vampire and be with Edward, and didn't want to wait until she was 40 and looked like Edward's mother as she aged!     Renesmee also caused quite a stir....how could Bella get pregnant when every secretion a vampire emits is venomousness? Again, anything is possible. She is a sacred creation, a perfect child who reflects both her parents. I felt relieved that the couple was able to have a child, and that they would do anything, even die, to protect her from harm. I suppose people could not get over the fact that Bella was only eighteen when she conceived, but I truly feel that people were getting too into the logistics of the story! Edward, Bella, and little Renesmee constitute the perfect vampire family. Their world is of the supernatural, and they do not have to worry about money, bills, mortgages, jobs etc.     Jacob's act of imprinting on the baby also disgusted several people because he knew one day she would be his bride. And really, people actually mentioned child pornography! How awful and ridiculous! It was clear that Jacob loved Renesmee, but he did not lust after her in any way. He acted as a loving uncle, and as Stephanie Meyer explained earlier, the act of imprinting encompasses love in different forms. His love for Bella's baby is the reason Jacob was in her life from the beginning even though she could never quite put her finger on it before the child was born. Jacob's love made perfect sense. It does not take away from the novel, it instead ties the bonds of family and the bond between shape shifting wolves and vampires.     Fans were also actually disappointed by the happy ending! I do not understand. Edward and Bella got to be together, forever. The family is intact, and Bella is transformed from an awkward high school student to a beautiful vampire. Everyone got what they wanted - if you want sacrifice, tears, and violence - then write your own ending and be satisfied. I am glad the characters were safe and happy at the end. I am sad that this is the last book in the saga, but I enjoyed the journey that was the Twilight Saga....

072325804X|5.0|Who hasn't heard of Peter Rabbit?  These are some of the best children's art and stories in the English language, presented in a single hardcover volume, with a nice slipcover covered by a sturdy hard box.  What's not to love?  There is one misgiving I have about the stories and that is that the pictures were evidently larger in the original books, and while they are reproduced well here, they are definitely on the small side.  You should be warned that the language was definitely written in a pre-Dick and Jane era, when children's authors weren't afraid to throw in a few big words.  There are also quite a few English and rural colloquialisms.  All of this makes it difficult for littler readers to follow, but this shouldn't pose too big of a problem.  The stories are also in many (not all!) cases rather slow-moving for a modern audience, like Milne's Pooh books.  None of these things should stop you from buying and reading these with your kids.  Indeed, it will help expose them to another way of thinking about the world, not so hurried, jaded, competitive, or anxious to look \\"cool.\\"
0525478183|5.0|I didn't plan on starting my review of John Green's newest book Paper Towns (2008) with a mention of Brotherhood 2.0, I really didn't. But having finished the book I find that, really, it is the right place to start.<br /><br />Back when I had a myspace page, a lot of my friends were authors, library types, and bands. One of those friends was John Green who posted a bulletin about a project he and his brother decided to start in January 2007. Having noticed that they communicated almost entirely through e-mails or instant messages, Hank Green decided that he and John should communicate for a year only through daily (except for weekends and holidays) videoblogs . The rules are more elaborate, but that was the basic premise. Throughout the course of the year, John and Hank exchanged a lot of videos about two things: Being a a Nerd Fighter, the true meaning of Awesome, and World Suck Levels. (Fans might also remember an entertaining Valentine's Day post relating to pink wine.)<br /><br />At some point during this crazy brilliant idea, John Green and Hank Green continued to work. For John Green that work was writing a book. And, maybe it's because I now know more about Green, but reading Paper Towns kept bringing me back to those Vlogs whose themes seemed to have made their way into this novel to interesting (and entertaining) effect.<br /><br />Now for some linkage: The original Brotherhood 2.0 videos can be found at [...]. (They also have their own channel on Youtube.) Since the vlog project's end in December 2007, the Brotherhood 2.0 site has been reshaped into a  Nerd Fighter headquarters at [...] Last, but totally not least, you can find John Green's site at [...]<br /><br />Now for some actual review:<br /><br />Quentin Jacobsen has loved Margo Roth Spiegelman from afar for most of his life. It's hard to not love someone who is equal parts phenomenon, mystery, and adventure. With end of high school mere weeks away, Q is prepared to accept that Margo will always be closer to fantasy than reality.<br /><br />All of that changes when Margo, dressed like a ninja, opens Q's window and asks for his help:<br /><br />  Tonight, darling, we are going to right a lot of wrongs. And we are going to wrong some rights. The first shall be last; the last shall be first; the meek shall do some earth-inheriting.<br /><br />And so begins an eleven part, all-night odyssey that will change Q's life, particularly--he hopes--how his life relates to the lovely Margo Roth Spiegelman.<br /><br />Before Q can find out with everything will be different, Margo disappears--on its own, not an unusual occurrence. Part of being Margo Roth Spiegelman demands the ocassional disappearance to plan and execute further adventures. The strange thing, the reason Q can't pretend this disappearance is normal, is that Margo left clues. For him. As Q, with the help of his fantastically-written friends, tries to trace Margo's path he finds more questions than answers, realizing that he might need more than clues to lead him to the girl he loves. He might need to revisit everything he thought he knew about Margo Roth Spiegelman, both the person and the phenomenon.<br /><br />Paper Towns combines elements of a coming-of-age story and a mystery. Q's search for Margo is, in many ways, just as important as working through the tedium and nostalgia of his last weeks in high school. The story is also very contemporary: the characters have (very clever)screen names that they use to instant message, a website not unlike Wikipedia finds its way into the storyline. Still, the timelessness of the story seems to ensure that this novel will not become dated as technologies change. Green's inclusion of excerpts from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass also points to this book's lasting power.<br /><br />Like An Abundance of Katherines (2006), the writing here has a verve and wit that keeps readers' attention and makes the book speed along. Although Green treads similar territory to his previous novels, Paper Towns remains unique and Q's narrative voice is utterly his own. The tone here is also something new; a blend of a nostalgia and the jolt of the now as Green expertly moves between past tense and present tense narration to emphasize key parts of the plot.<br /><br />Green won the Michael L. Printz Award in 2006 for his first novel Looking for Alaska. In 2007 An Abundance of Katherines (his second novel) was selected as a Printz Award Honor Book. I almost never make award predictions, but I think John Green might have a third Printz Award Winner (or at least Honor Book) in his future.<br /><br />It took me longer to realize that there were two covers floating around for Paper Towns than it took me to actually read the novel. The first cover, yellow and bright, seems to be the primary marketing cover. But there is also a mystery second cover with a different photo and darker colors that was on my copy. Without revealing too much, I wanted to mention the Two Cover Strategy because it's so apt. Margo is so iconic, so important, somulti-faceted, that it makes sense that she cannot be contained by one book cover.e tone here is also something new; a blend of a nostalgia and the jolt of the now as Green expertly moves between past tense and present tense narration to emphasize key parts of the plot.

B00004CJY0|3.0|This film is set in 1868 Texas. Uncle Ethan visits his relatives in a dry dusty land. Ethan wears a grey coat and blue trousers. Ethan remarks about Martin's ancestry as if it was unusual. He gives a locket to Debra. Ethan's double eagles are freshly minted. [This could signify he rode with the James Gang.] Visitors drop by with news of a cattle theft. Could it be the feared Comanches? The house appears quite large inside, and well furnished. The posse follows the trail of the stolen cattle only to find them butchered. Was it a ruse to draw the armed men away? Whose home would be attacked? The returning men find fire, ashes, and bodies. Ethan, Brad, and Martin set out to search for those who attacked the family and rescue the kidnapped girls. The small group of white men are able to fight off a much larger group of Indians. Then they separate.<br /><br />The film follows Ethan and Martin on their search for Debbie. Brad attacked the Indians in revenge for Lucy's death. They return to the Jorgenson's home. Martin wants to join Ethan in the search for Debbie. [A $1,000 reward seems much too high.] A letter brings news to the Jorgenson family. [This is played for laughs.] We see a herd of buffalo, then a troop of cavalry. An Indian camp was massacred. Martin is now a widower. Ethan doesn't find Debbie at the Army post among the survivors. They continue to search. An old Mexican sells them news of Chief Scar. Has Debbie grown up? There is drama in the meeting, and the attack on Ethan and Martin. Ethan has made a holographic will making Martin his sole heir. Debbie is dead to him.<br /><br />Ethan and Martin return to the Jorgenson's home. They are wanted men for the deaths of Futterman and his men. Their daughter is set to be married to a man who is not her first choice. Martin and Charlie fight. The Cavalry arrives with news about Chief Scar being nearby.  What are Ethan's plans for Debbie? Martin wants to rescue Debbie. They attack the Comanche camp successfully. \\"Let's go home.\\" Will there be a happy ending for all?<br /><br />John Wayne does not appear to be happy in this film. Was it changed much from the book? What about the charges against Ethan and Martin? What will happen to Debbie? Will Martin marry Miss Jorgenson? These loose ends are not tied up, as if they ran out of time or money to finish this film. What was the significance of Mose, a man with alopecia? This film is an example of myth-making, or revisionist history from Hollywood. I don't believe Indians would steal cattle only to kill them; its not cost-effective and goes against human nature. This novel was serialized in `The Saturday Evening Post', a popular literary magazine of that time. Its stories were often filmed.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Dear Wolfmother Wussies:    After I played this CD about 200 times and overcame my shock that there is some new music this amazing from the current generation's musicians, I went to Amazon to see what other CD's you guys have made.  To my dismay, there's nothing but singles and EP's.  Bummer. Tragic. First the world economy collapses, and now no new Wolfmother! (I see a connection.)    Then I went to Wikipedia to see what was going on with you. Shock and grief.  You losers have already broken up?  You tease us with one superlative album which puts almost everything out there from over the last 20 years to shame?  You were apparently offended and defensive that critics were calling you \\"derivative\\"??  Did you note that they are calling you \\"derivative\\" of about 25 different bands, all of which are the BEST in the history of rock music?  And did it occur to you that the occasional scurrilous reviews are from boneheads who are overwhelmingly conspicuous in their jealousy of your talent and what you accomplished in your first album??  C'mon!!  You allowed those little stressors to fracture the great talent you guys collectively harness?    I think you guys are really blowing it.  Not since the Beatles allowed Yoko to funk up their legacy has there been such a major forfeiture of musical potential.  Snap out of it!!  You owe it to the world to do five to ten more albums!!  Your sound is impeccable, absolutely the best out there!! I see you as the potential Tenth Pillar of Rock!!--just as prophesized in the Scriptures!! (Beatles, Stones, Led Zep, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Doors, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Metallica being the first nine. Obviously.) Don't mess with the Scriptures, guys!! Comport yourselves with destiny! The stone tablets demand some more albums!  Stop feeling sorry for yourselves, kiss and make up, and get your Down-Under arses back into the studio!  Now!!    Happy Holidays,  -tome raider

B0013FXWU6|1.0|After enduring the longest and most painful two and a half hours of my life watching this ghastly, pretentious, ridiculous and nauseous drivel, I came to the Amazon site expecting a flood of one-star reviews saying exactly the same.    Instead, I see hundreds of whinges about the DVD box! Who cares if it's cardboard or plastic or solid gold? For crying out loud, if it's packaging that turns you on, why don't you spend your money on corn flakes instead, and put your reviews on the Kelloggs website?    My one-star review is entirely about this film. Daniel Day Lewis, eyes all blacked up to make him look mean, plays it like some silent movie villain out of a Laurel and Hardy film. Which is all rather apt as for the first half hour of this bum-numbing eternity of torture, nobody actually says anything!    When they do start talking, it's a relief... but only for a few moments. After just a few minutes of DDL's grimy mumblings I was starting to grind my teeth. As he tried to bond with his loathsome kid, I started pacing the room, slapping abaseball bat in my sweaty mitts. But the final straw was when that odious teenage preacher started screaming and raving in his squawky pre-pubescent voice in his 'church'.     \\"That's it!\\" I told the wife. \\"I'm going outside to get some half bricks to lob at the screen!\\"    In fact, as this turgid, plotless and hideously over-rated guff unravels, you end up wanting to throw bricks at every single character who shows up.  What a load of dross!    Is it all a metaphor about human life? A searing indictment of man's capacity to carry revenge through several generations? What powerful emotional undercurrents are at work here in the corrupt frontier land of early 1900s America?    I couldn't give a flying fig.     All I want to know is... when am I going to get my money back for this shameful corruption of my OWN emotions... and when will Mr Day Lewis apologise for his terrible hammy performance and hand his Oscar back?    Those idiots whocomplain about the cardboard DVD sleeve should count their blessings... at least you've got something to line the bottom of the budgie cage.

It seems to be very durable except for the mirrors which look like they will break fairly easy. The truck is a little costly but it isn't like any other toy dump truck this looks like a real mack you see on the road. I recommend this for any kid who loves big trucks!

B00004W50Z|5.0|Maybe it isn't their greatest artistic achievement,but to listen to \\"The Band's\\" first 3 albums in a row I certainly would not think that \\"Stage Fright\\" pale's in comparison to \\"The Band\\" or \\"Big Pink\\".It may just be that the first two album's were so timeless that when the time came around to make a looser record (with song's reflecting that relaxed effort like \\"Time to Kill\\" or \\"Sleeping\\")it was assumed that they had fallen off a little from their peak.Whether you think they did or not this is a killer album and the \\"Loosness\\" of it is what I feel is so amazing about it.They were not trying to make \\"The Band\\" part 2.I probably listen to this and \\"Northern Lights\\" more than their first 2 albums.Though I love everything they ever released,I wouldn't call this anything but a 5 star album.  By the way the editorial review posted by Steven Stolder contains an error.The title track \\"Stage Fright\\" was sung by the great Rick Danko not the great Richard Manuel.

B000A2IPP0|5.0|This is one of the all time great movies for young and old. Speilberg touches on every human emotion in this film. Should have beat Ghandi, hands down, for Best Picture Oscar that year. It still amazes me that it didn't win because of Hollywood politics. It's the most delightful movie. Make you laugh through your tears.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|For a women so young, she can sing. Love the new album. Love, Love song! Best song by far
0452289963|3.0|PROS:  - Exceedingly challenging and profound philosophy. I doubt 1% of the readers can achieve what he is asking them to do (transcend your body, your desires, and this world). I suspect Tolle is unable to do it. If he cared so little about what people thought or his own ego, he probably wouldn't have fought so hard to get on Oprah and promote his book. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to do what he advises or that there isn't wisdom to what he's saying.    - Usually it's easy to read and fast.    CONS:  - He gets repetitive at times.    - He fills many parts of the book with new age, fluffy, mumbo jumbo. These vague, elusive statements can be interpreted many ways and can leave the reader feeling great (if the reader interprets the way he/she likes it) or feeling confused (if the reader is trying to understand what the author is saying).    - Could be more \\"how to\\" oriented. He should offer more practical steps on reaching this wise state of mind and spirit. He tells you that it's important to get there, but offers few useful ways on how to get there.    CONCLUSION: In many ways this is an extremely advanced book. I doubt most people can truly appreciate it, and fewer can live up to it. The subtitle is misleading. This book has little to do with finding your purpose. It's more about transcending your purpose, not really caring whether you have a purpose or not and just being content. Period. I recommend this to deep, spiritual people who are already not attached to many things. We often like to think that we aren't attached, but if I take away your home, car, degrees, job, and money, then you might feel differently. This book can help you get detached. It's tough to write a great book about this subject. Tolle has written a good one (hence, 3 stars), but not a great one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series. Even though you might say that the nine main characters could be a tad stereotypical, all have enough depth to be believable, and the interaction among themselves keep us interested in their fates. I liked the universe Whedon created here, with the Sino-American shared dominance. I would love to see this explored further. I wish somebody would reconsider and carry this series on.
0380713802|4.0|PROS:<br />- Bryson's writing style is fluid and funny.<br /><br />- Good coverage of Western Europe: 19 out of 22 chapters are on it.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The subtitle of the book is, \\"Travels in Europe\\", but it should have been called \\"Travels in Western Europe\\" since that's where 90% of the book takes place.<br /><br />- Bryson has minimal interaction with Europeans, only interacting with the locals briefly, even though he traveled alone. He seems to travel with his guidebook in hand, looking at buildings, but not really spending much time getting to know the people. Part of that probably is that he doesn't speak a foreign language well.<br /><br />- Not terribly informative.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Don't expect to learn that much about Europe, but do expect to laugh out loud. If those are your expectations, then you will love this book. I gave it 4 stars because it was so funny, so entertaining, that it overcame the flaws I listed.
B001DTUU7A|4.0|[[ASIN:B001DTUU7A Horton Hears a Who! [Blu-ray]]]    What a nice surprise.  My family of two young boys stayed away from the film in the theaters as most remakes of Dr. Suess' classic have been very disappointing.  When my son started asking for it and amazon had such a great price, I picked it up.  It's now in constant rotation and I must say, it's very good.    The Horton story is not very long and the filler used to stretch the film out works well.  The additional characters that were \\"beefed up\\" to add to the story are great.  The voice actors are some of our favorite (Seth Rogen)and Jim Carrey in no way takes away from Horton with his usual \\"Carrey-ness\\".    As a Home Theater show off Blu-ray disc, without spoiling any of the story, there is a scene with many pink flowers blowing in the wind.  It's pure 1080p eye candy!!!    This is not at the level of PIXAR, but right up there with the Dreamworks films (Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar) and worth a viewing.

B000PFUAO6|1.0|I love DT. Even my least favorite songs of previous albums have been at the top of my list to listen to when compared to other music.  This album is so choppy that I can't stand it. It's like everyone was playing their own instrument in their own room and then they just threw it together and placed vocals over it. It's not even music. I've tried and tried to listen to see if I would get it or if I was missing something, but it is seriously the worst cd in my collection. I wouldn't even sell it used, because I wouldn't want anyone to think that this is what DT is like.  Who ever produced this album, should never produce another as long as they live. You know who you are. Stick to what you're great at.

B000068TPN|5.0|Having studied the Vietnam war for decades, I can safely say this DVD is the closest movie yet to what really happened at the Ia Drang Valley during that 3 day battle.  Sure there are hyped up scenes and mis-characterizations, but remember, it was made in Hollywood and Hollywood takes editorial privilege with everything they do.  For those of us who served during that time or had buddies who served and died there, it brings back some awful, heart-wrenching and ugly memories.  I have watched it many times and have never been able to get through it without crying.  For our generation, its was the most painful time.  For those of you who severely criticized the movie, its a movie, okay?  But, it has some very poignant moments that trigger many painful memories for those of us who served with pride during that time and came home without any parades or fanfare only to be spit upon and called murderers.  If you didn't like the movie that's okay, but try to watch it from the perspective of those of us who gave some of the best years of our youth in service to our country.  For many of us, we totally lost the innocence of our youth during those awful years.  For 58,000+ of our brothers-in-arms , they gave their very lives.  Proud to have served...USN 1961-67

B0000YEEHG|5.0|PERSONA ranks as one of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces. Released in 1966 after a three-year hiatus following his \\"chamber films\\" of the early 1960s, PERSONA is Bergman's first mature film focusing entirely on human psychology and interpersonal relationships, leaving behind the religious angst of his earlier output.<br /><br />Even before the action of the film begins, we are treated to an incredible mix of images. We see an arc lamp come to life and film rolling through a projector. A silent comedy film pops up for a few moments, only to be replaced by enigmatic footage of a slaughtered lamb and a hand being nailed to a cross. Finally, a boy wakes up (incidentally the same actor as the child protagonist of Bergman's earlier film TYSNADEN), puts his glasses on, and picks up a book (incidentally the same book as in that earlier film). But he is suddenly distracted, and holds his hand out to the camera. We see the boy touch some invisible screen, as the eerie images of two women alternate upon it. Then, the credits roll. This opening montage may seem unnecessary, but it serves as Bergman's way of hammering home the point that what we are watching is a film, and far from being banal entertainment, cinema is in fact capable of expressing striking truths, as we are about to experience.<br /><br />The plot of PERSONA initially seems simple. The nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson) is tasked with caring for Elizabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann), an actress who has mysteriously ceased speaking. As Alma jabbers away, while Mrs Vogler says nothing, the action develops much like in Strindberg's play \\"Der Starkare\\". But a series of events suggests that things are much more complex than they seem. Are Alma and Volger the same woman, representing just two different facets of a single personality? This interpretation is a popular one and quite probable, but the film's mysteries don't end there. What is the meaning of the two historical tragedies Vogler witnesses, the clearing of the Warsaw ghetto and the self-immolation of the Vietnamese monk? Unlike contemporaries like Vilgot Sjoman, Bergman never directly responded to the violence of the mid-century, and I daresay here we get an explanation why, for how can mere words adequately relate to such horror?<br /><br />If you don't like auteur cinema, and films that are fairly open in interpretation, then I don't know if I can convince you to love PERSONA in a humble Amazon review. Nonetheless, this is a film I highly recommend for the questions it raises. Rarely does one encounter a work of art that provides such satisfying challenge and leaves one thinking about it for a long time after it ends.<br /><br />Sven Nykvist's cinematography expertly serves Bergman's storytelling. I was especially stunned by a long rolling shot as Alma and Mrs Vogler run along a beach. One gets the sense that after the intentionally limited \\"chamber trilogy\\", Nykvist was reveling in the greater variety of shots available to him. I'm impressed by how Bergman presents a plot that feels so epic when in locations and casting, at least, this is more similar to the chamber trilogy than the films of the late '50s. Besides Alma and Mrs Vogler, there are only two other characters, a psychaitrist (Margaretha Krook) and Mrs Vogler's husband (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who appear only briefly.lation of the Vietnamese monk?

B001GQSY5U|2.0|Star Wars just isn't Star Wars anymore.  We all know it, and have known it, and The Clone Wars only solidifies that statement.  A full CG-rendered animated film that serves as a precursor to the Cartoon Network series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars attempts to fill in the gap between Episode II and Episode III, as the Republic is at full-scale war.  Sadly however, The Clone Wars ends up being aimed at a more juvenile audience, and the whole thing just comes off as rather lame.  Not to mention that story-wise, things are just pretty boring, and any of the new characters that pop up here we just don't care about.  Still, there's some familiar voices to be heard though, including Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, and Samuel L. Jackson as Jedi master Mace Windu; and the animation itself is stylish and well-animated.  All in all, Star Wars: The Clone Wars is worth seeing for longtime Star Wars fans out of curiousity alone, but everyone is much better off sticking with the older Clone Wars microseries that debuted on Cartoon Network some time ago.

0679720200|4.0|The Stranger by Albert Camus is one of those books that has been on my \\"To Read List\\" as long as I've had a to-do list for reading. I never got around to reading it, and it's only because my Great Books Group is reading it for January that I finally sat down and read it. I confess I don't fully grasp existentialism, and my lack of knowledge often presents itself as a reason for me to avoid reading books closely associated with it. Even the fact that it is only about 120 pages long did not convince me to read it by my own choice.    As The Stranger was a Great Books reading assignment, my reasons for avoiding it became moot. I had to read it because we will be discussing it in a few weeks. Here is what I discovered.    The Stranger can be read in one sitting -- maybe two. This I promise: read the first page -- no, the first line -- and you'll be hooked. The short, succinct sentences of the first part of the book engrossed me. And the apparent change in writing style for the last part of the book did not deter me. Overall, the plot is keeps the reader engaged to the last word. The Stranger played in my head like a movie.    I used the translation from the French to English by Matthew Ward, Vintage Books, Random House. Albert Camus (1913-1960) is the Algerian born, French speaking writer and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Translator Matthew Ward imparts a distinctly American quality to the work, and makes The Stranger very readable while keeping it true to the original.    To suggest you will be hooked reading The Stranger is not the same as asserting you will understand the work. (Maybe you will have a complete understanding. I have yet to reach that point!) I enjoyed the experience of reading The Stranger, and yet I will bring to the discussion questions about the motives of Meursault (the main character) and I want to discuss Meursault's \\"inactions\\" as well. You can forget about existentialism when you read this novel; you will not need it to enjoy thebook.    For your reading experience, try to find a quiet place where you are less likely to be interrupted. (I know, this seems nearly impossible with job, family, etc., but the ability to concentrate uninterrupted will improve your reading experience immensely.) Though The Stranger is only about 120 pages, it contains tightly packed prose that can act as a movie, making you more of an observer than a reader. The Stranger illustrates an important type of literature, one with which I'm intimately familiar: literature that is complex, not easily discernible, and yet provides an exceptionally fulfilling reading experience. This novel, like other classics, will be more admired with subsequent readings.    Rating: 4 out of 5  Well worth reading.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|OK, let's get this out of the way: the movie is GREAT, not as a superhero movie, but just as a MOVIE altogether.  The great character development, the twists, and the action.  It has bettered its predecessor in the action part...and not too much dragging drama...In the sequel, the drama is not too long and well-placed and \\"makes sense.\\"    Now, on to the Blu-Ray.  One should really appreciate while watching on DVD (well at least on Blu-Ray): NO FREAKING MENUS...The movie just plays...you know...just like in the VHS days...No super fancy menus.  I really detest DVDs that creates this intricate menus that loads forever (yeah, I'm looking at you IRON MAN BLU-RAY)...Dear Movie Studios: NOBODY cares about DVD menus; Nobody will discuss about a DVD and discuss lenghthily about how the menus LOOKS.      The transfer itself is phenomenal.  One needs to see this on a 1080p TV...especially on a really good plasma/LCD with really good contrast ratios.  Anything else would make the movie look like nothing to write home about.  The scenes--especially ones filmed with IMAX cameras--would make you find yourself picking up your jaw from the floor.  THAT GOOD.    And the sound...Look, I watched this on a not-too-shabby 2.1 system and it sounded great...I can only imagine how it sounds like on a 5.1 or even 7.1 surround-sound systems.    As for the extras: To be honest, I couldn't care less for them.  After all, you buy the DVD for the MOVIE.  They could put a documentery about belly-button lint in there and it wouldn't matter to me.  Those complaining about the \\"extra features\\" needs to re-evaluate themselves on why they really bought the DVD.    All in all, I think it's a great DVD and a movie aficionado shouldn't miss it.

0393312836|5.0|This version of Burgess' classic contains his original transcript (and the one released everywhere outside the US), meaning the 21st chapter is the end.  This 21st chapter makes a huge difference in meaning and authoreal intent, and the difference is obvious.      After getting used to the lingo created by Burgess, the book has a great flow to it, and the chapters are the perfect length.  I found myself lying in bed, reading, and coming to an end of a chapter, deciding \\"ohhh they're short enough that I can read just one more\\".  One more usually turned into at least 3 more, and it made for an exceptional, entertaining, and meaningful reading experience.  Truly a classic work, I cannot wait to read more of Burgess.
B00005N5S5|4.0|This movie is a great movie with nice action, decent effects, great actors, and an excellent, although very confusing story line.  This movie is the oldest movie of James Cameron's that I know, and it is amazing.  It is probably my favorite James Cameron movie.  The Titanic was pretty good, but it doesn't beat this.  the three TTTs of James Cameron.  Terminator, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, and Titanic.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a captivating, dynamic film about just how cruel people can be to each other when relationships just don't go right. The action moves along at a good pace without ever being the slightest bit boring; and the acting is very convincing. We get especially noteworthy performances from Elizabeth Taylor as Martha and Richard Burton as George, an unhappily married couple who resort to liquor and abusive behavior to cope with a loveless marriage; and the apparently lovely young couple Martha and George \\"entertain for a nightcap\\" have their own demons exposed before the night is over.<br /><br />When the film begins, Martha and George have just left a party at the university where George is an associate professor. One of Martha's cruelest tricks is to verbally abuse George because he never rose above the associate professor position; her father is a highly powerful man at the school and they were hoping that someday George would be up to the challenge of running the history department. Of course, George has his own complaints about Martha, including his belief that her remarkably abusive behavior and game playing is disgusting--to say the least. George Segal and Sandy Dennis play a young married couple, Nick and Honey, who come to George and Martha's home after the party--only for Martha to essentially hold them hostage. That way Nick and Honey  can witness the cruelties Martha and George inflict on each other when they're fighting at their worst. Martha and George even fight over their son; and it's only at the end of the movie that we find out more about their son and the depth of his importance for their relationship.<br /><br />This is no movie for small children. There's violence, foul language and many blunt comments about men chasing women for money and power (which both George and Nick have done). However, if you want to see great performances and what is very possibly Elizabeth Taylor's greatest performance ever on film, you're in luck--this movie is just the ticket! The fact that this was filmed in black and white serves to highlight the darkness of people's souls; and black and white instead of color makes the film more powerful than it would have been if they had filmed it in color.<br /><br />The second disc has a good amount of extras. There is the outstanding and fascinating retrospective on Elizabeth Taylor's career from 1975 hosted by Peter Lawford; and I also liked the featurettes entitled \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: Too Shocking for Its Time\\" and \\"\\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: A Daring Work of Raw Excellence.\\" There are excerpts of an interview of director Mike Nichols from July of 1966 as well. The first DVD with the movie on it has a running commentary.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is great for fans of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; and fans of George Segal and Sandy Dennis will also enjoy this film. Some people may think that the entire film should have been shot in George and Martha's house to create an even tighter dramatic effect. However, I believe that this does not truly limit the power of this motion picture which is far and away a very special classic.e is just the ticket! The fact that this was filmed in black and white serves to highlight the darkness of people's souls; and black and white instead of color makes the film more powerful than it would have been if they had filmed it in color.     The second disc has a good amount of extras. There is the outstanding and fascinating retrospective on Elizabeth Taylor's career from 1975 hosted by Peter Lawford; and I also liked the featurettes entitled \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: Too Shocking for Its Time\\" and \\"\\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: A Daring Work of Raw Excellence.\\" There are excerpts of an interview of director Mike Nichols from July of 1966 as well.

B000CPGZHA|4.0|I get a horrendous Argentine version in a plastic box, not jewel case. Nothing to do with the English edition. It hurts, for a good dvd concert.   I recommend it anyway. Perhaps because of Venezuela and sent it to me ... that bad. Well ...
0307455874|1.0|I ordered 2 copies of this book for Christmas gifts.  Amazon promised that it would arrive by December 19.  I placed the order based on this promise.  After the order was shippped, I checked the status to see that it will instead be arriving on December 27.  I'm very disappointed in Amazon for false advertising.      In addition, I called customer service to inquire about this and the call was equally as disappointing.  The call came from over the internet and had a very poor connection.  I could barely understand the customer service person.  I think from what I could make out, the customer service person recommended that I reorder the products and have them shipped express.  I couldn't understand enough to verify that I would receive a full refund (including the shipping) for the previous order, and not be charged for the express shipping on the new order.  So, out of frustration I hung up with nothing being resolved.
1592220045|5.0|I read this book donkeys years ago, and found it again recently, and enjoyed it just as much now, as I did as a child, there is some good \\"big science\\" type stuff in the idea and ethics of genetics, and a good bit of wish fulfilment (who wouldn't want to roam the universe in a big bully mega death dealing out ship?). Tuf lack of character makes him an even more engaging character, I personally found him quite likeable and his ethical stance makes him the ideal, if not the only person suitable in the Galaxy to take charge of the seedship, and of course he faces many trials that would seek to \\"tempt\\" him from the path of righteousness. I am re-reading that last sentence and am wondering if there is a religious allegorical theme running through the overall story.. anyway, where was I, yes, as other readers have pointed out, this could make a really good film or better still a mini-series. This is a fun book, but great sci-fi, well and humorously told.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|I  wanted to see this when it first came out, and I'm glad I didn't. This film seemed like one big advert for a universal studios feature ride. There was zero believability whatsover as the main characters fall for thousands of yards and like cartoon characters survive without bumps or bruises. Sled on the fossilized skull of some unbelievably large dinosuar, ride a broken coal cart like it was a roller coaster etc.<br /><br />The main characters were likeable. The absent-minded professor, the trailguide, the unhappy nephew. But everything was dumbed-down and cartoonized presumably to appeal to an audience of children.<br /><br />I found myself fast-forwarding scenes where characters were constantly yelling and screaming as they were being chased and hounded, an the really sappy scene in the middle.<br /><br />Kids might like the action-y bits. Myself, I found it got old about halfway through. 2 stars.
0380713802|5.0|Ok, let me make some things clear for some readers.     a) This book does not (well, the version I read 12 years ago did not) present itself to be some sort of travel guide to Europe. If you want a recommendation for the best coffee shop in Rome or the nicest phone both in Hammerfest, buy a Lonely Planet Guide or something like that.   b) Mr Bryson whilst raised in Des Moines, Iowa, lived in the UK for 20 years, latterly near Settle in North Yorkshire, where I oft saw him leaning over dry stone walls, swinging on gates, or drinking a quiet cup of coffee at the Old Naked man café.  c) The above establishment, despite its name does not guarantee any sightings of old men, naked or otherwise. You have to go to the Golden Lion pub for that.  d) C) (above) was mild sarcasm, a very British trait and which is you don't appreciate or don't \\"get\\" means that no matter which BB book you read, you are going to end up disappointed.   e) This is very important. ALL OF BILL BRYSONS BOOKS TEND TO BE THE SAME SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE d) (above), YOU WILL BE VERY UPSET.  f) Points b) to e) (above) are written in the style of Mr Bryson, so if you don't like this review, you are unlikely to like the book.     So, if you are still with me, BB rambles around Europe in a hap-hazard way, making wry observations. The thing is this, and I suspect that many readers don't get it. Maybe its an English thing.     It spoils the book if you actually try and recreate it by going to see the things that he describes! It is more fun to not go there, and imagine that that's how those places and people actually are, and that amusing and gently madcap adventures follow him around. You will find that should you follow in his footsteps, madcap adventures are unlikely to follow in yours.    I think that BB explains his mindset best in his Down Under book, where he explains his best introduction to a new place is to have a cup of coffee and read the local paper. If that sentiment mirrors your own thoughts and attitudes, then I welcome you to the world of Bill Bryson, you will have a wonderful time.     For some others, I can save them some heartache by (forgive me Bill) offering you this abridged version.     \\"Neither Here nor There - By Bill Bryson (abridged by Pastor of Disaster) .  Chapter 1 - I visited every country in Europe (East and West even though the Berlin wall is still up and travel to some eastern-European countries can be rather difficult). All of the hotels I stayed in were really brilliant offering huge rooms with wonderful views, the food was amazing in all of them, and every restaurant and café, I had no problems at all with public transport and found every local I met totally helpful, and eager to present the fascinating cultural and historical aspects of their city/country in all of their splendour and in such a way that I could find no humour in it, just a further respect for my European brothers and sisters.  Chapters 2- 34 contains a detailed list of hotels I stayed in, the names and addresses of friendly locals and GPS co-ordinates of places I visited that have faithfully promised not to have changed in the intervening 16 years since I visited them in-case it offends your enjoyment of this book.     I thank you.
0743270754|5.0|Everybody who has read of the Civil War and Lincoln's administration has heard of Seward, Stanton, Chase, and Blair. Ms. Goodwin's treatment brings Lincoln and his \\"team\\" to life with enough background material to let the reader understand the tensions and interaction among the players. Better still, what other historians treated as Lincoln's dithering, Ms. Goodwin explains as gifted strategy and preparation. Fun read! Would have liked to see the sources noted.

B000YAA68W|3.0|There was all the rage about this animated movie that finally made me watch it.  I am not a great fan of animated films, so it takes a lot of convincing for me to see one.  To me this story really is about coming of age, differences between middle east and western world and a girl stuck in between becoming the unwilling participant of the events around her.  Marjane is curious, smart and overbearing while her immediate and extended family take a great effort to raise her right so she can be a decent human being.  Her background story is about political uprising in Iran is really a story about social polarization betweeen left (communists) and right (fundamentalists).  Very similar to 1930s in Europe when Nazis were getting advantage in Europe.  Our main character's protective parents send her to Austria in order to protect her from the unstable political situation, but shelter away from one country never really is a shelter against emotional ravage a young girl becomes a part of while away from her parents.  It is interesting story with the political history backgorund to it; it touches on the importance of family and values family instills in us that become part of our own moral values we live by every day.  Touching, but not memorable.  In French, so be ready for the subtitles.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I had high expectations for this CD.  I'm a big Cook fan.  He's the most talented Idol winner in my book.  He does not have big voice, but he's creative and original.  I wouldn't say this CD is great.  It has plenty of good tracks though.  I enjoyed it.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie is the best of what there is to offer as far as romantic comedy movies go. There are multiple stories happening simultaneously, and some of them are the sappy romantic stuff, but others range from sad to pretty outlandishly funny. It is this balance that makes this movie great, but doesn't over do the romantic part. A must have for anyone, men included.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I've been struggling with this one for a while, because quite frankly I wasn't sure how I wanted to go about writing it.  I think it's hard with a film like `The Dark Knight' because if you don't review it carefully then it may come across like just another superhero movie, and with `The Dark Knight', the film that has been hailed as the best superhero movie of all time you have to be able to relay that to the reader, prove to them that this is more than just an action film; that there is real stock in the claims that this is the `Godfather' of all superhero films.<br /><br />True, not everyone will feel the same way, but I feel an obligation to explain to you why I feel the way that I do.<br /><br />First I want to implore you, if you have not already, to watch `Batman Begins' before watching `The Dark Knight'.  The two are truly companion pieces and you will not be able to appreciate the full progression of character (especially within Bruce Wayne) that Nolan and Bale have created unless you first witness how it all began.  Sure, it is not necessary to see the first film in order to enjoy this film for the action/genre film that it is, but it helps you to see just how this film transcends the boundaries of its genre if you see it from the very beginning.<br /><br />What sets `The Dark Knight' apart from every other superhero film, and really any other genre film, is that if you strip away the costumes you still have a film.  This is not a movie about a superhero; this is a movie that contains a superhero.  This is a movie about the realities of destiny, our choices, our weaknesses, our loyalties and our failures.  It broaches those very human and very controversial subjects with an intelligence that is not often seen in a film of this nature.  I think that sadly too many critics of this film look at it as a superhero movie, and so they immediately shrug it off as nothing more, but if they were to search deeper into the root of this film they would see that this is far more than just another Hollywood Blockbuster.<br /><br />The film follows Bruce Wayne as he struggles to find a balance between his personal life (which he feels is leaving him) and his life as Batman, which is becoming more and more necessary as Gotham City becomes the target of a madman known as The Joker.  While the film follows a carefully crafted storyline of doublecrossment with The Joker offering Gotham's mob bosses a chance to keep their money and rid themselves of the Batman, the real story is all wrapped up in the conflicting sides of good and evil that manifest themselves in the characters that appear on the screen.  Everyone from Wayne to Joker to Gotham's new district attorney Harvey Dent are susceptible to this emotional corruption, and they all have different ways of dealing with that particular crisis.  The Joker introduces a new kind of madness to Gotham, a madness that knows no boundaries, and this proposes a question of ethics and morals within those who have to deal with this monster.<br /><br />The fact remains that the emotional punches this film throws your way are not those of your typical superhero movie; for they are far too real.<br /><br />The masterful performances by the cast only help elevate this film, added more layers of realism to the madness.  Bale reprises his role as Wayne and he does so with powerful conviction, especially as the film draws to a close and his own moral stance is jeopardized by his emotions.  I still haven't gotten used to the Batman voice, but his Wayne is by far the best Wayne ever displayed on screen; for he infuses Bruce with a humanity that has not been seen before.  Gary Oldman also returns as police lieutenant Gordon and this time raises the bar by inserting raw despair as the city falls to pieces around him.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also reprise their roles for this sequel and continue to astound, delivering significant aid to Wayne's personal transformation.  Newcomers include Maggie Gyllenhaal (who replaced Katie Holmes), Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger.  Gyllenhaal is a force here, never slinking into the background as did Holmes but making the character of Rachel front and center, providing the film the moral counterbalance to The Joker's influence.  Eckhart is magnificent as Dent, downplaying his own charms to give his character a sense of insecurity that only comes with the job.  Matched against Bale he is the perfect compliment to Wayne's insecurities masked over by an abundance of faux charm.<br /><br />But we all know that this movie is all about the late, great, Heath Ledger.  Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is a far cry from Nicholson's (we all know how I feel about that one).  Instead of portraying the fiend as a joke, Ledger sunk down into the darkness that corroded this mans sanity, and the result was an iconic look at the evils that exist in us all.  The Joker is an exaggerated look at the conflict wrestling in our own subconscious; the battle between good and bad that we all must struggle to win over.  Ledger manages to capture that without ever making it a mockery.<br /><br />I will not be one to say that this film has no weaknesses.  I feel that the film is a tad too long, I will give you that; and I was a little upset over the way the Two-Face character was give such little true treatment.  It could have easily worked itself into the third film, for the squeezing in of the character at the last minute seemed a tad rushed.<br /><br />That's it though.  I have no other complaints.<br /><br />The fact remains that `The Dark Knight' is a masterpiece.  It is a film that transcends the boundaries of genre and proves that you don't have to be a typical Oscar bait film to deliver a message.  Think back over the years of Oscar to the last time a superhero movie has garnered this much buzz and attention.<br /><br />I'm waiting.<br /><br />Nothing?<br /><br />Didn't think so.<br /><br />You see, `The Dark Knight' is unlike any other genre film out there.  Nolan and company have taken all that you think you know and turned it on its head.  The message within `The Dark Knight' is a bleak one, but it is given a glimmer of hope that we all do well to contemplate.  Yes, the world is a dark and dangerous place, but we have the opportunity to make the right choices regardless of how we are being conditioned.  We can stand up for what is right and fight the darkness that encircles us.  We can all be a superhero of sorts, for we all have the power of free choice.and Heath Ledger.

B000EQHHJW|5.0|A superbly directed production which is compelling from minute one to the end and features incredibly charismatic and thrilling vocal and acting performances by wixell and pavarotti as well as the rest of the cast.  Riccardo Chailly with the vienna philharmonic are masterful in their pacing,sense of dynamics and in their musical phrasing providing the perfect eloquent musical partner to this electrifying score.  This opera is not recorded on a stage but in mantua which expands and obviously adds more definition to the visual aspect.  So if you're looking to be thrilled,floored, and swept away by the power of Verdi's Rigoletto then you have come to the perfect place to get your fix.  Go ahead but leave the knife in the kitchen drawer.

0385335997|3.0|Ok, your husband is going to be hanged and unfortunately you can't help him. You've been abducted and are forced to care for a crew of yucky smelling men who are pooping blood.  You then are stranded on an island miles from civilization, and several islands away from your husband.  You must get to him with all haste. This is a dire moment.  Even if you have the full confidence in you husband's abilities it would be normal to experience some worry.      But when I should feel a building of tension I get FULL descriptions of ENDLESS mundane details that a frantic person wouldn't even think to pay attention to.    Also this book is very formulaic.  It's the same repetive use of this theme: a character gets a very short amount of introductory dialogue, then overly detailed descriptions of character appearance and some unnecessary physical actions ,then lastly a few short words more.  Supporting characters are quickly stifled because Clare's character paraphrases everything the supporting characters should have revealed. Maybe Gabaldon didn't feel these characters deserved any sort of real devotion. She especially does this to Jamie. No character is as important Claire's clever observations or Claire's inner voice.  It is as if Claire is a petulant, interrupting child, who must be heard above all else and believes she is the only one who has anything of value to impart. I don't want Clare to tell me what that character had to say....it is tedious because I would like to know how Claire feels about the information...is she scared?  is she angry??  I don't know...because Claire's character must be in such bloody darn control ALL the time  .     Also Claire must have forgotten the trouble she got into the last books because Gabaldon gave her a permanent case of the \\"stupids\\".      We are not vaccinated against all diseases.  Any doctor from the 60's would play dumb if confronted with mountains of bloody diarrhea. And it was just EGOTISTICAL for her to leave Jaime to be thehero when she was already underway on the VERY important mission of rescuing her nephew.  Not to mention she have just been reunited with the love of her life and have such precious little time with him.     Gabaldon lost focus and was just writing to be writing.  Could be condensed to 200 pages.  Maybe less.
1400063515|4.0|First off: The Black Swan is not as good as Fooled by Randomness. The concept behind the book is excellent but the second half of the book is not written very well. I hope taleb produces a full revision of this book in which he corrects this huge missed opportunity.

B00009R86L|4.0|I've been assured that the shoulder pad is excellent.  I bought it for my photographer daughter, but now need to purchase a STRAP.  The picture clearly shows a strap (thus would any reasonable person think that a strap would be extra?).
B000P12LWY|4.0|As a fan of period movies, I could not miss the Season 1 of \\"The Tudors\\".  Henry VIII, King of England is known to most as a man who broke from the Catholic Church to become Head of the Church of England and marry six women. Such infamy secured him a place in history, but so was the fact that it was his daughter with Anne Boleyn - Queen Elizabeth I, who was one of the most benevolvent rules of her time.  In any case, season 1 has four DVDs that will entertain you for almost 12 hours.  Perfect time to watch it would be this holiday season.  I was suprised that series had so much sex in it but also the twists and turns about historical background for Henry's decision-making and his pick of the closest advisors on his court is something I wanted to understand better.  Writers do get sloppy towards the end of the series and the language is not as sophisticated as one would expect it to be on the Court of one of the greatest kings of his time.  I find Jonathan Rhys Meyers to be excellent in his role, but perhaps too young to play a king married for 20 years to Queen Catherine.  Maria Kennedy who play Queen Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England is graceful and dignified.  Unlike the actress Natalie Dormer portraying Anne Boleyn.  Ms. Dormer is too coarse and unsophisticated in her role for a someone (like Anne Boleyn)who was witty enought to keep Henry's interest for so long,speak fluent French after being at the French court for many years.  This portrayal of Anne Boleyn is not befitting of a woman who was a mother of one of the most influential queens of the british royal history.  Court politics, intrigues and the switch of loyalties will keep your attention.  The lessons learned are the ones that apply event o today's modern times and that is perhaps the one more reason for having this series so popular.  I cannot wait to see season 2.  Costumes and jewelry are breathtaking.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|So this film is for intelligent people with an attention span who have an afternoon or an evening to spare. Go get your favorite thing to eat. For me, that'd be California rolls, I'm mad for those, and San Pelligrino lemonade.   Rent this, or buy, I can see buying, it's that good. I could also see watching it with someone of equal intelligence, just so long as you don't have to spend any time explaining things. I hate having to explain story line, plot, you catch me.   This movie is amazing. Enjoy yourself.
B000IJ79WU|1.0|Although the extra scenes(the most notable of which was a screen test) were interesting, I missed 1)the villainous brute testing his laser-eyes on a snake, 2)Superman dramatically flying-off from the Fortress of Solitude after he's regained his powers, and 3)Lois Lane falling into the river at Niagra Falls.  This new version had little continuity, and lacked character development.  After spending money on this turkey, I'm forced to do so again on the standard version, which I sorely missed.  This version would have been a very nice dvd extra to the standard version...alas, it's a complete waste of money on its own.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|So there's this guy (Super Hot Ralph Fiennes) and he's giving a lecture at this college as a favor for his British diplomat friend. This stupid cow, Tess, completely humiliates him during the lecture in front of a class full of people. He's like totally devastated at being humiliated like that and decides to get full-on revenge on her. To get even, he comes up with a brilliant plan to marry her and take her to the poverty ridden cease pool of Kenya under the guise that he's a diplomat with the British government. In actuality, he's really just a gardener for a real diplomat named Sandy who truly falls in love with the co-ed who humiliated the gardener who gave the lecture in the first place.   But uh-oh. Now she's been murdered along with the gay black guy she's best friends with in Kenya. See, she got bored just sitting around Africa all day and started emailing the charitable drug companies who were providing drugs and vaccines to the Kenyans who can't even afford clean water, threatening them saying she was going to get them in some sort of trouble. She's causing difficulty for them the same way she humiliated her poor innocent gardener husband.    Just guess what happens next.   Well, I guess I already told you. She gets murdered.   Ralph Fiennes is very hot in this film and so if you are an aficionado of Fiennes than this is a must-own. Ralph even started something called The Constant Gardener Trust because when he was in Africa he was shocked and appalled that the Africans didn't have basic sanitation and he wanted people to have a way to donate money so that decent sanitation methods could be built. Never mind the guy has millions sitting around in off-shore accounts and could have easily done the entire continents sanitation needs himself. He'd like you to help. Google, \\"The Constant Gardener Trust.\\" I did.   If you don't care for Fiennes and are irritated by African music, British accents and bright colors, stay away from this film at all costs.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Really good video. It kicked my butt, burned a lot after the first day and had to rest for a day.
B00005JLKN|3.0|My first problem is with the DVD cover. I have no clue why they have Sir Anthony Hopkins on there except if it's to make people think that this is a Hannibal Lector movie, you know, a gross-out cannibal movie. It's not that at all. But if you buy this or rent this thinking you're going to get a Silence of the Lambs Part 3, you're gonna be pissed off.     This is a magical love story between a blind girl and a guy with bad teeth. It's like that ice skating movie from the 70's, Ice Castles, but there's no skating and no nice love songs or anything.  The guy, Mr. D., was horribly abused as a child by his grandmother because he pee's the bed. Thus he has a really hard time opening his heart to a girl without killing her and her family first and placing bits of mirror in their eyes. But when he meets a blind girl, who can't see his teeth, he falls in love. He introduces her to lots of new experiences that don't involve the mutilation of her family members and their relationship unfolds in a very delightful way.   Ralph Fiennes is Super Hot as usual in this film, even with the teeth thing going on. He appears nude several times and has a wicked tattoo all over his back which he says took 8 hours to apply. Yummy!

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|This review represents an update after nearly 3 years of heavy usage. See below for the update.<br />-------------<br /><br />For all those of you, who are reading these reviews, and can't quite figure out why Nikon would make such a \\"deficient\\" product, as this SB-900, this review should forever put the debate to rest.<br /><br />It has been suggested that the SB-900 is a sub-standard unit, because it will \\"overheat\\" at times, causing it to shut down, until it finally cools off, allowing it to eventually resume operations. There are some reviewers on this site, that will lead you to believe that this \\"safety\\" feature is an engineering flaw and thus, all would-be buyers need to beware, and seriously look elsewhere.<br /><br />I recently purchased this flash and used it heavily during a conference this past weekend, in which I was one of two event photographers.  Admittedly, I was a little cautious and reserved when I purchased this unit, secondary to several negative reviews regarding it's habitual \\"overheating malfunction\\".<br /><br />Reflecting on it's performance this past weekend, I am pleased to report that It was used heavily in all situations and it never \\"malfunctioned\\" - not even once. Obviously, there were a couple of times when I was too far from the subject, causing the unit to discharge at full power. But, as an observant user, I recognized that this was my clue that I (not it) was doing something wrong. Thus with minor and reasonable modifications, a good outcome was reliably achieved.<br /><br />Interestingly, the owners manual does state that if the unit is used too heavily, it can get hot and shut down temporarily, as a precautionary measure. But it must also be noted that the owners manual for both the built-in camera flash and the SB-800 say the very same thing! In other words, if ANY flash is abused, misused or in any way used in a manner that is inconsistent with its designed purpose, it will overheat and shut down.<br /><br />This is NOT a design error on the part of Nikon. The overheating will only occur if the flash is fully discharged upon multiple consecutive occurrences, on a subject that is too distant for the flash to appropriately illuminate. If the flash is found to shut down, it is a sign that one must move closer to the subject or add more flash units. Again, overheating and shutdown is NOT a design flaw, it more appropriately represents operator error.<br /><br />Additionally, the new design is truly welcomed! The controls are MUCH better placed and much easier to use. It recharges much faster and works very smoothly. I am very pleased with Nikon's new design and any logical user will feel the same.  You will not go wrong with this unit and undoubtedly, will find it a pleasure to work with on a regular basis.<br /><br />In summary: Do not be mislead by those users who are using the unit inappropriately. If you have never caused your built-in camera flash or SB-800 units to meltdown or \\"freez-up\\" (pun intended), You will likely not experience any such event on the SB-900. It is a very well designed unit, is much easier to use, and functions much more smoothly than any flash Nikon has put out thus far.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />-----------------------<br />Review Update 2.5 years later after MANY additional events.<br /><br />OK, now after having the flash for a total of nearly three years, using it under all circumstances, including weddings, & conferences,  I can again conclude that the flash is a very welcomed update. It has NEVER shut down, although once, under unusually heavy usage, the temp did get unusually high and I was aware that it certainly could, but never did.<br /><br />The only conclusion that I can arrive at, is:<br />1. My unit is fault-free and others are flawed???<br />2. I am among the those not abusing the unit???<br />3. I have realistic expectations and some others do not???<br /><br />Again, years later, after MANY heavy events, I have NO regrets whatsoever!<br /><br />Also, if the unit was such a lemon, why is a 3 year old unit, selling for MORE than it originally sold for new, on eBay???<br /><br />I would love to buy another unit, but I have a hard time paying MORE for a 3 year old unit then I paid for mine NEW, years ago!<br /><br />For all would-be-buyers, carefully take everything into account. The unit is truly a serious design upgrade from the SB-800. It works much better and again, I own BOTH units and only use my SB-900, for many good reasons.<br /><br />After years of usage, I can only highly recommend it and would dearly like to get an additional unit for similar events.<br />------------------<br /><br />If you found this review to be useful, please place your vote, so others can benefit as well.<br /><br />Thanks!I would love to buy another unit, but I have a hard time paying MORE for a 3 year old unit then I paid for mine NEW, years ago!

A technical note: The info field on my PS3 reports that the DTS HD Master Audio is 6.1 tracks while the box says the soundtrack is 5.1. My receiver is indeed being fed a discrete back surround channel. If you have a receiver/speaker setup with back surround, check to see you're getting the extra channel.

The detail in Horton's skin, the dust trail as the speck is first propelled on its journey of imminent doom, and the funky textures and hair of the Hoos bring out the best from a good 1080p setup. The movie itself has just the right mix of drama and comic relief - it's a thriller afterall!

1903517575|5.0|Paul Genney weaves a good tale with this patchwork legal quilt of `fly on the wall' vignettes linked to his character, `Wally' Wallace of Whitebait Chambers, up north. I met Paul recently and he outlined his book, which took my attention so I read it with interest after the defining Mortimer years with Rumpole and Sir John's concerns over `New' Labour changes to our profession which seem to have set the current precedent in modern legal characters after Henry Cecil's Roger Thursby in the Fifties, (which was controversial enough in its time.)<br /><br />Most practising barristers will identify very quickly with the issues confronting our flawed hero, Henry Wallace. I'm not giving the plot away, but let me just say that Genney falls nicely into the Somerset Maugham concept of the novel which should end with a death or a marriage, or so Willie said in his most esoteric work `The Razor's Edge' (which didn't).  Read `Pleading Guilty' and you will see the nice twists as they develop.<br /><br />It is a book for today with the nice, under-done boot kicking softly at the legal establishment, born more out of a frustration with the system which we all feel from time to time. This snapshot of legal life has the statutory four letter words -a bit too many, but probably at the publishers' insistence if modern success in getting published is anything to go by. Some were rather unnecessary as most of these words are normally `quotes in court' and not that often heard in the robbing rooms (as we are a bit busy).<br /><br />I came away at the end, as I sometimes do at the end of a case, feeling for the loneliness of the advocate - many of us been there with Wallace and the dead client, and some of the more fundamental incidents of life which most portraits of barristers just seem to have to include: adultery and personal life, dealing with death, and quirky clients of one description or another. But that's what we do.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I found this book hard to put down when I started it, so I became curious and had a bet with myself as to how Genney would structure and flow his 43 chapters.  He has clearly borrowed some of his old briefs and witness statements (just to refresh his memory, of course) but the result works as his ingredients mix well with the office relationships and the great names he comes up with- I liked, especially, Horace Pickles, or should that be James Rumpole! Yes, I know who you mean.  Readers should look at chapters 23 and 27 which I found particularly moving and I am sure many legal professionals can identify with much of Genney's understated views.<br /><br />This is a great new contribution to modern chambers fiction, and if he comes up with a sequel, let's have less of the bad language, more character description but keep your concept of two legal twists at the end. And please keep the jokes running, especially if they are at the expense of New Labour and certain London chambers.  Well done, Paul. We can't give you the `detective writers' dagger', but I will happily give you the `chambers' writers gavel' from the departed Rumpole, as Henry (`Harry') has now joined the legal fiction club for the twenty-first century, and let's hear more from him and your provincial Bar.became curious and had a bet with myself as to how Genney would structure and flow his 43 chapters.

B001CZVVVO|4.0|I have a collection of classical DVDs recorded at this venue but this blu-ray release is definitely one of the best, both in sound and picture. While the program itself lacks originality,  the performances of both the orchestra and  soloists are truly outstanding. I would have given this disc a 5-star rating except that I have a couple of minor criticisms. First the camera work is not top-notch in my opinion - it is too abrupt at times and too much use is made of zooms. There are also some very odd camera angles and sometimes the singers are not on screen when they are singing. Video directors of other concerts from the \\"Waldbuhne\\" have done a much better job in this respect. Secondly, the subtitles are sometimes a little difficult to read - for maximum readability, the white letters should really be overlaid over a grey background. This appears to be a problem with other Blu-ray classical concert and opera releases.
B0013V33DG|5.0|It's clear from all the 5-star reviews that there is no danger that anyone will be wondering if this production is worth considering - it clearly is. But I am still keen to make a crucial argument in favor of Ms Dessay's brilliant performance. It seems to me that we - our generation - will be seen in any account of the history of opera, as the first to see productions which - as a general rule, rather than as a rare event - have taken into account the importance of great acting. Opera is, after, indisputably a dramatic art. Millions of dollars and euros and pounds and rubles would not be spent on staging it if it were not. Concert performances have their place, and audio-only recordings enable us to \\"produce\\" the operas we love in \\"the theatre of the mind,\\" with the advantage, on occasion, of having a cast which includes the very best singers of the age; but there is nothing to compare with a production, in an opera house, in which the performances on stage make us believe in the *truth* of what we are witnessing. And our generation sees many more productions than any of its predecessors did in which the singers are also actors who are able, both through how they look and how they act, to make it easy to suspend out disbelief, even make us forget about the central anomaly - that the people in front of us sing rather than speak. We can BELIEVE IN what we see, and thus enjoy it to the full.    That said, it strikes me that we are especially fortunate to be living when Natalie Dessay is at the pinnacle of her art. In this instance she is able to demonstrate that she is a brilliant comedienne. For heaven's sake, LA FILLE DU REGIMENT is not the operatic equivalent of a fragile piece of porcelain; it is a jeu d'esprit which has its tongue in its cheek throughout. And Marie is a tomboy who has every right to think of herself as a drudge, and it is this (I think perfectly appropriate) version of Marie that Dessay chooses to embody. (I do not have any inside information about the respective contributions of actor and director, I simply believe, after seeing N.D. in numerous different roles, in every one of which she is stunningly convincing, that the uniqueness of her Marie is largely her own creation.)    In almost every instance, in my experience, I would say that if I was watching a play rather than an opera and Ms Dessay performed as \\"only\\" an actor, I would be similarly engaged by the quality of her performance. And would applaud as I do when I watch her in opera - from the gut.  She is, I believe, an actor of genius, perhaps the one great virtuoso of her generation. I feel sad about anyone who does not love this little shrimp of a sutler, as she does her work and grumbles about it at the same time, who is ready, literally, to jump into the arms of the rather stiff Tyrolean she has found, who is utterly bewildered (but not fazed) by the letter in which she learns who she is. It is a stunningly fine piece of acting, AND, miraculously, she can sing bel canto as well as anyone singing today - and better than almost everyone else. And Strauss, and Mozart, and Ravel and Offenbach and... and...    This DVD is one very happy event, in my opinion, one that delivers an hour and a half of high-spirited comedy performed close to perfection. I've been watching a recording taken off the broadcast of the same production from the Vienna State Opera, in which there is also the sublime pleasure of Montserrat Caballé's appearance as the Duchess. Heavenly!  And how lovely it is to see how thrilled Dessay is in her presence.
B001GKJ2FW|1.0|This is a total waste of money. Meryl Streep flails as she dances, and the singing looks like bad lip sinc.

And the performance of the Eroica is dramatic and certainly not bad given the large size of the orchestra and its youth.  If I were at the concert I too would be standing applauding at its conclusion, but it is doubtful that it will demand repeated listening on DVD.  The competition is too great.

1439102813|5.0|How does someone write a book this good on their first try? I'm still in awe!  After having read only one chapter yesterday, I got in a bubble bath around midnight to read just one chapter before going to bed...well...about 5 hours later and many refills with hot water, I finished the book and the bath. At the beginning of each chapter, I promised myself that I would stop at the end of that chapter and go to bed, but I absolutely could not stop reading this book. The characters are written so well that I felt I knew them personally. Reading about Alice's descent into non-awareness of her condition was heartbreaking, but also made clear the point that somewhere along the way, the problem becomes more of one for the caretakers than the victim. There are many ways to die, and, of course, no one gets out alive, but Alzheimer's Disease has to be one of the worst for the victim and the family. Again, I am shocked that this is a first novel. The imagery written in the scenes at the beach are perfect to represent the fragility of life. It was so sad to read how the relationship between Alice and her husband progressed as her illness did. I believe it was an accurate description even if it was a fictional account. I highly recommend this book...just don't start reading it at bedtime!

The psychological components that gave the show life began to morph into a series of clich&eacute;s that reminded me of an alcoholic who repeatedly calls to apologize for behavior he's powerless to prevent.<br /><br />In the end, the behavior becomes as predictable as it is boring, and as a result, I started to resent Hank's helplessness. It also seemed to be contagious, because every member of the supporting cast was some way, somehow victimized by their own absurdly preposterous foibles.<br /><br />In the end, the edges were wearing thin and the show had started to edge closer to a parody of itself.<br /><br />Californication has been granted a third season, and I hope this time around Tom and company focus more on Hank's inner evolution - or devolution - if that works in some ironic way.<br /><br />The endless - if improbable - sex, drugs, and rock and roll are always good sellers, but character development is far more satisfying.<br /><br />Where the hell is that wormhole, anyway?n some ironic way.

B0015GDVTU|3.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />P.S. I LOVE YOU is one of those films that falls firmly into the \\"chick-flick\\" category. The story surrounds the grieving widow, her mother, and her friends, and how they all come together to help heal after the death of the studly husband. Sound schmaltzy for you guys out there? It might be.<br /><br />But it is unique for a couple of reasons...<br /><br />First is that one of the main characters, Gerry (Gerard Butler, [[ASIN:B000Q6GX5Y 300]]) is dead. Although we meet him for a brief moment early on and during a series of flashbacks, he is, in essence, not there. We also don't get to watch him die. The death is startlingly quick, and it jerks the viewer to full attention because it is this sudden loss we see and feel via Gerry's wife, Holly (Hillary Swank, [[ASIN:B000OONQ8U Freedom Writers]]), who also senses the loss of Gerry as extremely sudden -- due to a brain tumor, or so we're told.<br /><br />The other interesting thing is that Holly learns more about her husband after his death than during their short marriage. She travels to Ireland (where they initially met) at the behest of Gerry who, during his illness, arranged for Holly to have a life after his demise. He does this post-mortem trickery by arranging for messages to be dropped off to her at various times and from various people around New York. Initially seeming to be macabre, the story rapidly evolves into ...something more. Holly's trip to Ireland with her two best friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) reveal to Holly that there's a lot more life out there after losing your soul-mate. And she finds it in unique and disturbing places.<br /><br />Another unique quality was that Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates, [[ASIN:B00139XZF4 The Golden Compass]]) turned out to be an accomplice within the entire story's machinations, something that took even me by surprise. Pleasantly. I also enjoyed the eventual dead-end relationship Holly ended up having with Daniel (Harry Connick Jr., [[ASIN:B00009M9BK The Iron Giant]]) that I thought would turn out very differently. And Holly's Ireland love interest, William (the hunky Jeffrey Dean Morgan, [[ASIN:B0018B7E8G Weeds]]) figures heavily in Holly's past and, possibly, her future.<br /><br />But even with all of this uniqueness, the story as a whole turns out fairly predictable. The grieving widow heals (albeit unusually), friends help her, mother helps her, and new friends and lovers make her grope for reason and what her life now means. It is schmaltzy, so just be prepared for that.

B0016Q2D5M|4.0|I wanted to see this flick because I liked the original Journey to the Center of the Earth with Jame Mason and Pat Boone.  That movie was a real long journey, mostly on foot and still captured the imagination.<br /><br />What this movie did was made the story into more of fascinating joy ride.  It gave you thrill ride sensation, like you were at an amuzement park or at a theme park.  The movie had some fun scenes that must have been great in 3D.  I liked the roller coaster ride that was created from the mine shaft train, a little Indiana Jonesish, but still fun.  The dino scene was a little silly, but still fun.  The falling scenes were also pretty good.  Although the humor was campy, there were definately a few laughs.<br /><br />Fraser is a rather nice guy geologist who is down on his luck, his brother went missing over ten years ago and Fraser is attempting to keep his work going.  His nephew is sent to spend a short vacation with him and Fraser is given his brothers things that eventually open the door to going on the journey.  Cool were the older copies of Jules Vernes actual book.  I remembered some of those from grammar school.<br /><br />There is the usual troubled teen issue at the beginning and he grows from his bonding experience with his uncle.  So we have a good story, good comedy, great action and effects, but, it was still a bit light.  I wish they would have had Pat Boone show up in the flick for a cameo giving us a connection with the old movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed the scenes in Iceland and Italy, and of course, the Center of the Earth.  Good for a laugh or for a light evening of got nothing better to do.

This DVD is easily worth twice what I paid for it, and makes a great last-minute gift for those people that you never know what to buy for Christmas...
1400032717|4.0|I enjoyed reading this novel.  I found it engaging right from the start.  It was interesting to see things from a different perspective.  I got some insight, I think, into a very different way of looking at life.  Christopher would, indeed, be a handful.  My problem with this book and why I would not give it a rave review is the atheism kind of tacked-on here and there.  It feels false to the character.  It feels like the authour saw an opportunity to preach his view of religion and was not faithful to the character in so doing.  I found that disappointing and distracting.  It is not integral to the story, though, so it's easy to overlook.

B0012GN0Z8|1.0|The best of this EP disc are the other tunes on the album, \\"Tougher Than The Rest,\\" \\"Be True,\\" and an acoustic version of \\"Born to Run.\\" These are all tunes that will get a smile from Springsteen fans. None are extraordinary, but they're all good.<br /><br />The title track is everything Springsteen haters detest about the Jersey Jesus anad then some. The song opens to a long 1:20 sermon delivered in the most self-righteous pompous tone of voice in which Springsteen salutes Amnesty International as if he is the enlightened one preaching down to the ignorant masses.<br /><br />I for one wish Bruce Springsteen would shut the F!!! up about politics. He is a fanatic true believer of the hard core left wing dogma that permeates the entertainment industry but where he is a genius at writing incredible songs that give meaning and purpose to the heroes of everyday life, he is no genius on matters of history and politics just a blind adherent who follows the script.<br /><br />The performance of \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" that would be a great song for Bruce and crew to perform isn't strong enough to go through the effort of using some fancy software and editing out his Amnesty International blah-blah-blah to make a nice custom disc.<br /><br />If you are politically to the left of the Clinton's this disc is just for you, but if you're an old school Democrat, Middle-of-the-Road Moderate, or God forbid, Republican, you will find this disc highly offensive.
159194113X|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.<br /><br />But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.<br /><br />Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.<br /><br />But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.<br /><br />Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave.will come alive, and never quite leave.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|I won't go into as much detail as other reviews, they have already covered how wonderful season 4 is in detail.  I will say this though - having been a faithful Lost fan since the first episode, I was extremely pleased with Lost Season 4.  I will begrudgingly admit that this show sometimes takes its time with answering our questions.  With season 4, however, we truly are seeing the beginning of the end.  As a result, each episode in the 4th season seemed to answer or at least begin the process of answering a big question viewers have had about the series.    Lost is easily my favorite television show that is currently airing, and the 4th season just reaffirmed that fact.  The Blu-Ray is the perfect thing to tide me over until the 5th season premiere.      Namaste!

0307269752|5.0|There's no need for me to comment on the plot of this novel, since it has been extensively reviewed by others. Suffice it to say this is one of the latest and best in the locked-room genre--though the room here is an island on which people have been isolated by a vehicular accident.<br /><br />In many ways the novel is reminiscent of Danish author Peter Hoeg's `Smilla's Sense of Snow.' Both novels, in addition to dealing with the unraveling of a crime, are concerned with deeper, cultural issues. Lisbeth Salander, like Smilla, is a loner struggling to survive in a difficult world in which she copes strictly on her own terms. Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading journalist who has been disgraced by a libel case, provides focus on contemporary Swedish society. When the two team up, sparks fly.<br /><br />This is the first of the books in a trilogy Larsson left as his legacy at his untimely death in 2004. I can't wait to read the other two.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|This short film was created by the genius Joss Whedon and started as a 3 part web movie.  The DVD features 2 separate commentaries, a making of featurette, and a number of ELE Applications.  My favorite part of the DVD is COMMENTARY! the musical.  Instead of the common spoken commentary that explains each shot, COMMENTARY! the musical really doesn't explain anything that is going on in the movie but instead has the cast and crew just singing about themselves and why they love the movie.     The music, the dialogue, the hilarity...I can't suggest this DVD more.  Purchase the DVD and CD and watch/listen them over and over again until you start to sing the songs in your sleep.  Enjoy!
B000FC10HA|4.0|I read this book because I had read their other book the 22 Imutable Laws of Branding and whilst there are some similarities, there is still some good stuff in here. They explain marketing in a simple way and don't over theorise. You can still pick up some marketing gems even if you have been marketing for years. I agree with one reviewer who said marketing is \\"not an exact sicence\\" becuase it relies on the human mind and emotion so much. Something which is very important and is explored in [[ASIN:1905430477 The Brighter Marketing Bible for Small Businesses]]. If you really want to find out more about marketing but don't have much time the 22 Immutable Laws of marketing is a good read. Just because it is simple don't dismiss it.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|This album threw me off during the first few listening sessions. After watching DC on AI and voting for him many times, I was eager to get my hands on his album since winning AI. At first, I was a little dismayed as it was a different sound from his work on Idol. But this album has grown on me and I now listen to it every day and love it totally. Same for his song, \\"Light On\\". It grew on me as well. But the real treasure is \\"Permanent\\" and that song shall be immortalized somewhere, somehow, as it is David Cook at his passionate, raw, best, singing for his beloved brother.   Go for it, DC listeners. You are in for a treat. Already I am looking for more from this intense, passionate young man. And I want to see where he takes us next.
B0004Z33EG|3.0|Seeing this movie, and expecting something innovative, I was disappointed with what I got.  And while it wasn't terrible, it wasn't something I saw as worth multiple re-releases and being hailed as a classic.<br /><br />And for these comments, I get bashed and flamed and mocked and insulted for things beyond my control.  As of now and the viewing of this film, I was/am only 20 years old, but apparently I'm not old enough to \\"get\\" this film, because according to the people who commented on my review, I'm \\"still a child\\" and given a mantra of \\"You just don't get it\\".<br /><br />And this time it was completely different from the \\"You just don't get it typical American needing your car chases and gunfights to be entertained\\" mantra given for pretentious crappy art films, it was a \\"You just don't get it because you're a snobbish little twit for being 20 years old\\".  Wow!<br /><br />And kind of ironically, I end up re-releasing my review, changed a bit by circumstances unrelated to these flamers.<br /><br />Spending some time thinking about the film and watching \\"Rambo\\" again and \\"First Blood II\\", I saw that the film was not a 2/5 but more a 3/5 in my view.  I do that because the character of John Rambo himself is a far more well-rounded character than I gave credit for, and he is a far more amiable and pitiable person than I had originally thought.<br /><br />The plot in my opinion does not spend enough time on the true \\"story\\" of the film.  The subtle, ulterior plot that I had not even noticed until some time after the movie, ultimately culminated in \\"Rambo\\" in 2008; that John Rambo died in Vietnam, and what emerged from the jungle was a broken, lonely man, unable to overcome the fact that, as he so put it in \\"Rambo\\", war is in his blood.<br /><br />The movie does spend plenty of time on this, culminating in a climactic monologue by Rambo which is itself worth a viewing of the film, but the more pressing factors of \\"Generic Action Flick One-Man-Army-Bad-Ass-Mutha vs Faceless Baddies\\" overwhelmed me upon a first viewing.<br /><br />In \\"First Blood\\", there wasn't enough affirmation that this story is about John Rambo, either in the form of more flashbacks, or more exposition, and instead muddle it under a frenzy of cold, detached action that may fare well to draw in a larger, entertainment-oriented crowd, but ultimately costs the main theme of the film sufficient build-up for the big final climax which solidifies the movie.<br /><br />So in short, the movie could have been a classic.  But too much energy was built towards short-term action rather than long-term drama.  Quite frankly, I'm pointing more towards Rambo flashbacks by the campfire, and less Doofballed Douchebags blowing up a cave entrance then getting rowdy as fratboys for nearly effing up the mission (\\"Bullseye!\\" says one particularly stupid-looking idiot with glasses after firing a bazooka into the cave entrance, in a closeup shot and one-liner that really could have been done away with without any harm whatsoever).ng.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|I dislike writing reviews for products that have a bunch of reviews already posted since mine get lost in the shuffle.     This is a 5 star release if I ever saw one. The bottom line on this third box set is that it is all about the extras. While I have read Chapter and Verse cover to cover, I found the interviews on the DVDs quite informative. Maybe it is seeing the interview as opposed to reading it. Either way, insight into the 5 of the best albums they have made is absolutely fantastic. I would have purchased this box set for the DVD Reissues interviews alone. My particular favorite was for Selling England By The Pound. I really enjoyed hearing how Steve Hackett felt about that one.    But there is more. They have almost 3 hours of live footage. Here, it is a mixed bag. I was a little disappointed in Supper's Ready concert.....it was not nearly as powerful as on the CD. Other footage though is absolute gold. Nice insight into how their live act developed. I'm sad there is no footage of Anthony Phillips though. As far as the extra songs disc, I think it is safe to say that everyone has been waiting for the Jackson Tapes. All the other tracks have been released either officially or otherwise. Having never heard the Jackson Tapes, I was unsure of what to expect. I can't believe this is the same group that recorded From Genesis To Revelation at the same time. It was also interesting to see some lyrics and music used later as parts of other songs such as Anyway, etc. I would not have guessed that a song from the Lamb had its origins traced back to 1969.    As far as the title of my review, I am not an audiophile so these CD's sound as good as any release to me. I think it is perhaps unfair to review these releases for sound quality as opposed to content. I can see maybe knocking off a star (2 max) for those who can hear the difference between the different versions.

B000002KB8|5.0|This is the album that birthed Heavy Metal.  Dark, loud, fuzzed out, scary, and impossible to forget.<br /><br />1.  Black Sabbath - beginning a long-standing tradition of metal bands doing a song title of the band name on the self-titled album.  Opening with a soft falling rain and a distant church bell tolling and a little thunder rolling in; at the 0:37 mark the riff hits.  THE riff, completely overshadowing the thunder in the background Iommi, Bulter, and Ward blast Heavy Metal into existence like a sledgehammer.  This song sets the tone for a lot of Sabbath tunes to follow: varying tempos, time changes, dynamics (loud as hell then soft as a mother's touch), with Ozzy's signature banshee wail, and a lyric about how there is real evil in this world & you should be very afraid of it.  Four & a half minutes in the tune changes to a galloping, driving force rumbling to a close.<br /><br />2.  The Wizard - Opening with Ozzy's slow harmonica riff the rest of the band joins in for a bluesy rocker with a nice guitar & drum flourish early on.  The verse structure settles into a simple guitar and bass line driven non-stop by Bill Ward's fluid yet powerful drumming.  The title character walks the world casting spells and causing general discomfort for evil things around.  The lone hero, \\"never talking, just keeps walking, spreading his magic\\".<br /><br />3.  Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B. - Due to some record company stipulation, a band got paid more if a record had at least 10 tracks on it, so for the first few albums the boys slapped some extra titles on intros & outros and threw little instrumental bits in here & there.  Thus, \\"Wasp\\" is nothing more than the 30-some second intro to \\"Behind the Wall of Sleep\\" and \\"Bassically\\" (yes, two S's) is a Geezer Bass solo intro-ing \\"N.I.B.\\".  \\"BtWoS\\" has a groovy, laid-back riff and a lyric about opium.  \\"N.I.B.\\" (my personal favorite Sabbath tune) is a love song from the point of view of the Devil himself fallen for a human woman.  Like tons of other love songs throughout the ages the song promises all sorts of unearthly delights and gifts, \\"the sun, the moon, the stars; all them I seal\\".  Of course, being the Devil, Lucifer ACTUALLY has the ability to provide these promises.  The song bops along at a good pace with a slower break at the \\"going to feel\\" bridge.  Classic.<br /><br />4.  Wicked World - Opening with a jazzy drum line and a speedy little riff the song settles into a well-paced bluesy rumble.  Lyrics once again about real evil in the world: single-parent families struggling to survive, politicians starting wars, etc.  The song slows to a halt to let Tony throw a little solo around.  The rest of the band pops right back in and comes to a squealing close.<br /><br />5.  A Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning - This suite opens with a guitar and Jew's-harp-sounding quiet intro with a couple lines about a \\"Sleeping Village\\".  For those of you that don't know, \\"Bit of Finger\\" refers to the industrial accident Tony suffered in which the tips of a few of fingers were sliced off his right (fretting) hand.  Thus, completely changing the way he played, tuned, and strung his guitar; forcing Geezer to make changes, and ultimately resulting in the down-tuned, signature Sabbath sound.  Anyway, \\"BoF/SV\\" turns into a rollicking little instrumental at about the minute mark.  Lots of change-ups, with Bill seeming to direct where we go next.  At 3:50 the \\"Warning\\" kicks in and Sabbath take fellow British blues rocker's \\"The Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation's\\" 3-minute tune from 1967 and stretch it to 3 times it's original length.  No extra lyrics are added, but Ozzy must have left to go grab a sandwich (from 7:05 to 13:25) and the boys just left the tape running as Iommi, Bulter, & Ward take us to blues-rock school.  Wonderful.<br /><br />6.  Evil Woman - A bonus track on Japanese releases of the album and on the Black Box: The Complete Original Black Sabbath-and-the-kitchen-sink-for-good-measure 8 CD box set.  Anyway, a cover of \\"Evil Woman (Don't Play Your Games With Me)\\" from Minneapolis' \\"Crow\\", originally released in 1969.  A good blues rock tune.<br /><br />So, there you have it, while America was awash in peace, love, and flower-power, four working-class dudes from Aston, England shows us that things sucked and you'd better say something about it.  Still influencing rockers 40 years later.Evil Woman (Don't Play Your Games With Me)\\" from Minneapolis' \\"Crow\\", originally released in 1969.  A good blues rock tune.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|A friend of mine recommended the Foxes to me and since my first listen to this record months ago, I have been hooked, mesmerized and moved by their music.  What I most love about their sound is the mix of 60s folk along with a more spiritual Celtic sound.  I certainly haven't listened to enough music this year to say whether this is one of the best albums.  However, I've listened to just enough to say that this is my favorite album of the year.  From the first notes of \\"Sun Rises\\" and \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" to the last songs of \\"Meadowlarks\\", \\"Blue Ridge Mountains\\" and \\"Oliver James\\", this record moves my soul.  Along with their EP, the Fleet Foxes have me hooked.

0061120081|5.0|This book, by Harper Lee is a true classic. Every character, every scenario is perfectly written. It's touching and heartbreaking at times, but the book ends on a note of hope.  Even secondary characters have an unique personality, from Calpurnia, to the Cunningham's.  Atticus Finch is truly a great lawyer, fair and just-which is proven at the end, when he doesn't want his own son, Jem, to have unfair protection against the law. He doesn't quite care about others opinions, and is able to see the bad of the world but still believe in it all the same.  This book represents the loss of innocence, shows racism, and depicts cruelty, all from a young, still innocent girl. This is truly a great book, and anyone who has not read it is missing out.
0156030209|3.0|Honestly, this book is longer than necessary and moves WAY too slowly. Normally I can finish a book this length in a couple days. It took me weeks to drag myself through this book. It was by sheer will and determination that I even finished it. This book was recommended by a friend and Amazon based on other books I've read. It did NOT live up to the hype. There are so many books out there which are much better.<br /><br />At no point did it ever make me want to believe in God. It's argument, God is the prettier story- or as other have put it, why not believe in God- it's a sort of hedging your bets strategy, is really not very compelling. I actually thought the \\"second\\" story was better and more compelling because it shows the truth of humanity.<br /><br />I liked the contrast between the stories, and maybe that should have been developed more. And the beginning is completely confusing.
B001EAWME2|4.0|There is no need to discuss what a classic the original Black Christmas is. That has been done at length by reviewers for other releases. This review is specifically for the Black Christmas [Blu-ray] edition.<br /><br />The transfer and sound are great. There are still some traces of foreign matter visible from the print used, but this is the nicest copy you'll probably ever see on a home edition. I believe it is the same transfer used for the Special Edition in 2006.<br /><br />The features are identical to the Special Edition release:<br />- 12 Days of Black Christmas featurette<br />- Midniht Q&A<br />- Interviews ( Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and Art Hindle)<br />- 'Uncovered' Sound scenes<br /><br />My only complaint is the lack of subtitles or commentaries, and for that reason I only give 4 stars. Apparently space limitations were the problem on the Special Edition. That would not be a problem on blu ray. It seems the rights to the commentaries from the 2002 Collector's Edition are owned by another company so those were not available, but it seems that new actor commentaries might have been obtained for this edition.<br /><br />Sadly, Bob Clark was killed by a drunk driver in 2007. For fans wanting the director's commentary, the collector's edition is the only option and will become increasingly harder to obtain.<br /><br />If you have the Special Edition and an upconvert dvd player you might give this one a miss, as there are no new features to speak of. If you have a blu ray player and don't already own the special edition, the Blu-ray edition is the way to go. Of course, you can hold out for a \\"Definitive Edition\\". There's always next Christmas...
076790592X|1.0|Am I the only person who feels like Mitch Albom writes with extreme egocentric undertones? I couldn't even absorb the lessons and wisdom I was supposed to be taking away from this book because I was so aggravated by Mr. Albom's narssicism. It seems like every page was steeped in a light bath of 'thank goodness Morrie had me' attitude. Not to mention the outright statements like the part where Mitch talks about if he died, his boss wouldn't even care as long as he had some of his amazing writing underneath his dead body.    To me, a young but frequent reader, this book felt more like a tribute to Mitch than a tribute to Morrie. Did anyone else feel that way about this book? Or am I way off base here?

1416594884|3.0|The Cold War, Le Carre's forte, is long over, and Le Carre has turned his attention to the war on terror. But the sides have switched, and Le Carre's disenchantment with the West pervades his current work. [[ASIN:0316159395 Absolute Friends]] is another example.    One of the wonderful things about Le Carre was the nuance and ambiguity he brought to his stories, but I feel as if he's lost that. This story is about a mysterious young man who arrives in Hamburg for a mysterious reason. He's a Muslim--maybe, a Chechen--maybe, an escaped prisoner--maybe, a terrorist, an idealist--we don't quite know. For equally mysterious reasons, an idealistic young German lawyer and a not-very-idealistic British private banker decide to save him from deportation, which, given his background and clearly illegal entry into Germany, doesn't seem unreasonable. The Germans, Brits and villainous Americans get into the act as part of a larger scheme to entrap a Muslim cleric. Based on what Le Carre tells us about the cleric, this doesn't seem unreasonable either. But Le Carre clearly thinks it is.     We've all become disenchanted with the war on terror, no doubt, but Le Carre could always show us that all is not what it seems. But now, what he sees is clear, at least for him. It's too bad.

B001LRJH0U|3.0|If not for the always brilliant Viggo Mortensen and the equally talented Ed Harris, Appaloosa would be quite the borefest. I have never liked Westerns. This is not an exception either. I found the film to be very slow moving and the plot completely dull. Renée Zellwegger's awful performance didn't help matters and I will not be mentioning her again here.    However, the subtle relationship between the two main characters is really the key to this film. They don't talk much but they communicate with greater clarity in one scene than most actors do in an entire film. It really is amazing to watch, and slightly humorous. Mortensen and Harris are like an old married couple. They really get each other and have such a great rapport throughout the film. If not for them, this movie would be a waste of time.    Jeremy Irons is the other standout here. Of course, he's good with any material and you get a sense that he almost doesn't belong in the bleak boring western, but forget all about  that as soon as you hear that familiar rasp. While his character is cliché and not all that interesting, it still doesn't matter because the actor is just so damn good at what he does. He plays bad very well.     There is supposedly a twist that really isn't and like I said, the plot leaves much to be desired and the ending feels quite rushed and unsatisfying-but if you happen to like westerns, then Appaloosa might be worth at least one look. *** for the performances. ** for the actual film.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is great. Of course it should have been out during launch but who cares anyway. I didn't get a PS3 till the MGS4 bundle came out and this was included. I decided to get another controller to be able to play madden with my buddies and it couldn't be better. The only controller that is capable of competing with this one is the Nyko Zero and the only way I would buy the Nyko over this one is if it is 5 bucks which I did on Black Friday.

B000IMUYJM|5.0|I first saw Black Christmas many years ago when I rented it on VHS at Blockbuster; so you know it was awhile back.  I love 70's & 80's horror movies.  I don't know if its' the creepy atmospheric scenery or what, but I love old horror movies from this time period.  I like Black Christmas for the most part because you never get to see the killer; you only hear his creepy, crackling, high pitched screams on the other end of the telephone.  I also love Margo Kidders' character, as a crass talking, booze drinking, bitchy housemate.  I will say to anyone who loves horror movies; get Black Christmas and add it to your collection, you won't be disappointed.
031606792X|4.0|Great book if you're on Team Edward. Unfortunately there's a bunch of Jacob stuff midway through but then gets back to the couple you actually want to read about. Some people complain that the book ends too tidily but if you were disappointed with the direction New Moon and Eclipse took, then you'll be happy with this one. As for the emphasis on sex some people complain about, it's really not that intense. And after four books it's about time the fans got some satisfaction. Go Bella & Edward!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|First let me state I am a big Batman fan. When the 1989 Tim Burton Batman movie was announced like a lot of people I was thrilled and couldn't wait to see it. It promised to be dark and edgy and I couldn't wait to see Batman on the big screen finally done right. Then I saw it and well...I was very dissapointed. I personally felt it had a lot of campiness and although Jack Nicholson as the Joker was fun to watch he was too comical and never felt like that big a threat to Batman. Then the following movies just got worse, especially when Joel Schumacker took over it became the TV series all over again. I was saddened by this because a lot of good comic book movies were coming out and yet I still had not seen a Batman movie the way I thought it should be.<br /><br />Then I read about Batman Begins coming out and what it was suppose to be about. I was excited in one way but I was also very concerned it would be screwed up yet again. I saw it at midnight showing and was glued to my seat. This movie was GREAT. No campiness the Scarecrow (who at first I admit I wasn't excited about seeing) was scary and actually made my girlfriend jump in her seat. I could now see clearly why bad guys feared Batman. This movie was so good I went and saw it again the following morning. the part and at the end when Batman holds the Joker card made you eager for the sequal. Although I desperately couldn't wait to see the sequal to this I was worried, I thought \\"How could it possibly be as good as the first one?\\"<br /><br />Then The Dark Knight was released. I avoided watching previews or listening to hype because I wanted to be surprised, sometimes in previews they show the best parts of movies and I wanted to avoid that. I went with a large group of friends also all eager to see this movie and it wasn't as good as Batman Begins...it was better. They bring out Gordons concern of escalation in a huge way in this movie. Heath Ledger as the Joker although a huge concern for me when I first heard he was going to play him turned out great. I literally forgot I was watching Heath Ledger and only saw the Joker. To me he was perfect. He had the craziness the Joker needed, he was scary and very, very evil. He is supposed to be Batmans primary nemesis and in this movie he truly was. Batman had to break rules to catch him. Aaron Echart also did a terrific job as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. You see although he is Gotham's white Knight he isn't exactly stable and is capable of breaking wich of course he does. Although I felt Two-Face should have been in it a bit more his presense was great and he is the best looking/scariest Two-Face I have ever seen. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel was also great. She did a great job and much better than Katie Holmes. I do not think Katie Holmes is a bad actress but she just wasn't as good as the other actors in Batman Begins so she stood out. Casting Maggie in this movie was a good move. I also respect that she had to fill the shoes of someone who had played her before and give off existing feelings for Bruce wayne, I felt she did that very well and I had no problem accepting her as Rachel. Miahcal Caine and Morgan Freeman always do an outstanding job and they continue to do so in this movie. One of my favorate scenes in the movie is when Batman is using his sonar vision and Fox is explaining to him what is going on. This movie has a lot of emotion in it, it shows the best and the worst parts of all of us but in the end shows we can be great. It illustrates this well but doesn't beat you over the head with it. I personally loved this movie but as stated earlier I am a batman fan.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet or you are thinking about buying it, I suggest the Blu-Ray version. The picture on the standard definition is really bad and you can tell Warner Bros. threw everything (picture wise) into the Blu-Ray release. One thing that is interesting is some shots are filmed on an Imax camera. During these shots in the Blu-Ray version the aspect ratio changes, it is not distracting and you only notice if you are specifically looking at the black bars. I watched this with my Girlfriend and brother and neither of them noticed. I am not really sure why they did this though because the Imax shots are suppose to look sharper and better but to me the entire movie was sharp and the Imax scenes did not seem any sharper or clearer than the rest of the movie. But that is just my opinion.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you haven't seen this movie yet please do not listen to hype or reviews or anything else, go see it for yourself. It may suprise you.anges, it is not distracting and you only notice if you are specifically looking at the black bars. I watched this with my Girlfriend and brother and neither of them noticed.

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|In all of the reviews, someone must have made the connexion; but for those just now looking to buy this film in the Blu-ray edition, I should say a word or two.<br />First: the picture quality is excellent.  The pictures look much more solid; and the sound is fantastic.  If you have even a portion of the equipment, you can get much out of this movie.  The \\"much\\" they provide.<br />But is it complex?  Is the storyline a visionary enigma which baffles the viewer?  Is there something deeper that we do not see?<br /><br />The answer, I believe, is a surprising: Yes!!<br /><br />On the surface, one seems to be filled in fairly quickly about what is going on.  Eventually all is revealed; and revealed with a special-effects extravaganza flourish!<br />But the viewer of this film, is indeed misled into believing it is about a man who awakens in a bathtub; confused, dazed and thinking himself a killer.  A killer soon being chased by unusual figures dressed in black.  From there, the story mainly \\"seems\\" to revolve around this man, with Kiefer Sutherland ultimately providing some of the answers we need.  Though not all.<br />The reality, though, is that the movie does not revolve around the gentlemen in the bathtub.  The true center, and answer, to the enigmatic movie lies in none other than the occasionally seen: Kiefer Sutherland!<br /><br />What does it all mean?  Well, you figure it out for yourself.  But I shall give you the beginning to the final answer to this movie.  The name of Kiefer Sutherland is: Daniel P. Schreber.<br />There is your clue; and there is the Key to this movie and what it ultimately means.<br />I believe this movie should be given a second subtitle of: \\"Memoirs Of My Nervous Illness\\".<br /><br />Once you make the true connexion--(and this has to be more than a coincindence!)--then rewatch \\"Dark City\\" with a fresh awe.  An awe that few modern movies of any genre supply.<br /><br />IN CHRIST JESUS: THE LIVING TRUTH: THE LIVING GOD INCARNATE!!!<br /><br />Braithwaite :)

1400063515|4.0|N.M. Taleb fulminates against the adepts of the Gauss-distributions (calling them madmen) and applauds profusely the Mandelbrot-fractals supporters. Why? Because the tail-ends of the Gauss-distribution underestimate the occurrence of black swans (unattended phenomena, spikes, large deviations).  Indeed, for N.M. Taleb, `our world is dominated by the extreme, the unknown and the very improbable. Our future will be increasingly less predictable because of the apparition of black swans.'  The author even rejects Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, because it is ... Gaussian.    But, as J. von Neumann said: `mathematical formulation necessarily represents only a theory of some phase (aspects) of reality, and not reality itself.' Even Mandelbrot fractals are models. More, its exponents are not easy to gauge.  There is also a huge difference between descriptive and predictive (based on the past) models. Moreover, as the author states himself: `you can project the behavior of a physical system in the future. But we hit a stumbling block when humans are involved, if you consider them living beings endowed with free will.'   However, as Schopenhauer said, our minds did not develop in the first place for thinking, but in order to have the best survival reaction (fight or flight) in case of danger.    I agree with the author that `we just don't know how much information there is in the past'; that `there is a huge gap between what we know and what we think we know' and that `people don't know what they don't know.'    Nevertheless, there are black swans for outsiders which are simply white ones for insiders. For the author, one example of a black swan is the 9-11 massacre. But some people made a killing in the stock market by buying massively put options on airline and brokerage stocks just before the attacks. An extremely strange and mind-boggling event.  There are other black-white swans (see Gene C. Marcial's `Secrets of the Street').    This thought provoking book is a very worth-while read, but it has to be handled with caution.
0743270754|5.0|I will make this short and sweet so you can get on with all the other reviews.  I'm  not a big reader, especially non-fiction.  I honestly bought this book because Obama recommended it.  I started reading and immediately could not put it down.  I'm 45, a CPA, but not very academic as a child.  I think I got all D's in history.  I found myself transfixed to how human Lincoln and his cabinet were, and appreciated all the little details so I understood more about their emotions and the day to day living they withstood.  I feel so much more connected with the history of my country.  I experienced the same thing watching the recent TV series John Adams.  For me its the same experience as when I finally lowered my own father off his pedistal and realized he wasn't super human, but a man, whom I am so more fonder of now than when he was super human!  oK not so short, but I recommend this book for its own unique perspective.
0312370849|5.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" is the haunting and memorable story of a young girl's experience of the Vel d'Hiv roundup of the Paris Jews on July 16, 1942, intertwined with the experiences of Julia Jaramond, a transplanted American journalist assigned to write about the roundup for its 60th anniversary.<br /><br />The first half of the book, told in alternating chapters, introduces us to Sarah Starzinski, age 10, her little brother Michel, age 4, and their parents, who live a quiet, peaceful life in the Marais district of Paris. Even though life has become more difficult since the Nazi take over, the children still go to school, and play hide and seek in their small Paris apartment. Their favorite hiding place is a small cupboard in their bedroom, in which they keep water, some of their favorite books, and which has a lock and key. During the early morning hours of July 16, 1942, Sarah and her parents are awakened by the Paris police and placed under arrest. In an attempt to save her little brother, Sarah hides him in the cupboard, locks him in, and promises to return for him in a few hours. Sarah pockets the key, and leaves with her parents. Along with thousands of other Jews from all over Paris, they are taken to the Vel d'Hiv, a large arena on the outskirts of Paris, where they spend several horrific days before being transported to the concentration camps of Drancy and finally Auschwitz...<br /><br />Sixty years later, Julia Jaramond struggles to balance her marriage, family and work. Her family will soon move into a new apartment, one Julia isn't fond of; her husband, Bertrand Tezac, is charming, but also arrogant and often embarrasses her with his cruel jokes; her daughter, Zoe, is 11, highly intelligent and unnervingly mature for her age; and the editor of her magazine who has little respect for anything about her other than her work.<br /><br />The second half of the books is told through Julia's eyes, as the at first reluctant writer is shocked to discover the whole truth about the roundup, including the fact that it was conducted, not by the Nazis, but by the French police and city workers, and that over 4,000 children were taken, most of whom were been born in France, and therefore French citizens!  The deeper she investigates, the more she is drawn into the malestrom, quickly becoming obsessed with Sarah, and the first hints of the involvement of her husband's family in the tragedy...After Julia discovers that Sarah did not die at Auschwitz, she becomes consumed with the idea of finding her. Then she discovers, through a revelation by Bertrand's father, the fate of Sarah's brother Michel, making the full connection of the Tezac family to Sarah...But, while all this is happening, Julia discovers she is pregnant and her marriage begins to fall apart. All of this leads to some agonizing soul searching, as Julia  questions herself, her feelings, and her beliefs.<br /><br />While the author avoids melodrama, in many places this book seems almost too unemotional. But this, in fact, adds to the experience of the story for the reader, making the events that much more disturbing and shocking. The author also pays tribute to the legions of unsung heroes, those people who put aside their personal fear and danger to help another in need. In this book they are the DuFaures, who take in the starving, troubled Sarah, hide her from the Nazis, and make her part of their family. It is through them that Sarah is able to take her key back to Paris and learn what happened to her little brother Michel.<br /><br />This book authentically portrays both Sarah's and Julia's lives in an absorbing and empathetic way. In fact, one (or both) of these complex and interesting women could be a good subject for a book by themselves! It is this, combined with the mysteries surrounding Sarah, Michel, and the Tezac family that make this book so hard to put down, and is also why the reader will remember this story for a long time after it is finished.luding the fact that it was conducted, not by the Nazis, but by the French police and city workers, and that over 4,000 children were taken, most of whom were been born in France, and therefore French citizens!

B001GKJ2DO|3.0|...or James Bond sings!<br /><br />The film adaptation of the smash [[ASIN:B000031WEN Mamma Mia! The Musical Based on the Songs of ABBA,]] has a lot going for it. The least of which is the immensely likable songs of ABBA, which anchor the movie with familiarity. The scenery is gorgeous and the cast is packed with exuberance and cheer. Then again, at 59, Meryll Streep steals the film with her presence as the former girl-group singer retired to an island resort. Packed with good cheer, great music and eye catching dance numbers, \\"Mamma Mia\\" is as frothy and glittery as the foam riding the tops of an island wave. But it's also just about as substantial.<br /><br />As Donna, Streep just shimmers. Her gal-pals Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Waters) each have scene stealing moments. When Tanya lets loose on a flirtatious younger man with \\"Does Your Mother Know,\\" it's one of the funniest bits in the movie. As Sophie, Amanda Seyfried carries her songs probably better than anyone here. Even as she is the focal point of \\"Mamma Mia,\\" the story is ultimately Streep's. It is Donna's crisis of parenthood (the flimsy set-up where Sophie invites her three probable fathers to her wedding) that forms the crux of the movie. The musical numbers spin off in all direction, not always conducive to the plot.<br /><br />Be that as it may, we watched the \\"sing-along\\" version of the film is great fun, and Streep's version of \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" is a show-stopper. I also defy you not to sing along to either \\"Dancing Queen\\" or \\"Waterloo\\" (done as a campy finale with the principals in ABBA period costumes). Also noted, none of the male leads can sing worth a lick, although the story that Brosnan didn't know he was being cast in a musical is pretty funny (he was approached with the offer to play a male lead in a movie with Meryll Streep, then was told what the movie was AFTER he accepted). But if you accept \\"Mamma Mia\\" for what it is, a big hunk of feel-good fun, you won't come away disappointed.<br /><br />Now where is that Movie adaptation of [[ASIN:B00009ILC4 We Will Rock You]]?ow where is that Movie adaptation of [[ASIN:B00009ILC4 We Will Rock You]]?
B0015ABRE2|5.0|i could write a long review telling how great this season is but i just have to say that Dexter is one of the few tv shows that keeps the quality in a such a high level that is quite impossible to not give props to the writes and directors!  just amazing.
B001GQ2TGA|2.0|I have been an Enya fan for a very long time, I am very disappointed with this CD. I have never given enya less then 4 stars, but here it is. I would not recommend this CD, but if you have never bought any of her CD's, I would deffinately recommend any of the other ones, especially Shepard moons or a day without rain.
B001DSNEJM|3.0|I was surprised how good this movie was.  A bit of a shame it wasn't released in theaters while other worse films were.  The Lazarus Project isn't amazing, but it nails it's goal as a psychological thriller.  Definitely worth seeing, and if you're just looking for a psychological thriller you haven't seen, and won't be disappointed by, get this.    The plot twists are managed very well; you don't know what is really going on until near the end.  I thought the final scene was a bit over the top, but the overall experience of watching the movie was suspensful and kept me engaged to want to see what was going to happen next, and care for the main character, Ben.  I was hoping he'd remember this or that, etc.  Other than that very last scene, I can't think of any other faults with the movie at all...it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. It isn't Se7en, and it doesn't try to be.  A lot of movies ruin themselves like that.    Anyway, this is a good movie.  Check it out.
B00006JSGQ|5.0|Simply awsome!  Who needs money for nothin' and chick for free!  Knopfler's solo stuff is silky smooth and very haunting with that unique strat sound that only he can deliver!
B000S0GYRU|5.0|I'm not going to insult your intelligence.  I don't think you stumbled across this movie by chance.  You've heard of it from somewhere.  You're interested.  And if you can suspend disbelief and just enjoy a movie then you've come to the right place.  This movie has engaging characters, a storyline that certainly isn't hard to follow, trippy soundtrack, and a few shocking scenes... of what?  Watch it and see for yourself!  That's part of the fun!

B00177Y9ZC|2.0|***mild spoiler***<br />I wanted to like Jumper, I really did, but something about it just made me shrug and think (that was a very long hr and a half).  The action scenes have little bits of eye candy, but the plot's fairly terrible and the dialogue is instantly forgettable.  I saw the movie all of one night ago and really the only line I can remember is something near the end where he seeks out his mother.<br /><br />The main characters, David Rice and Mille, are off globe trotting after a brief barroom fight.  That I can buy, or at least shrug off, but it seemed that the actor and actress had very little onscreen chemistry.<br /><br />Nothing about the movie really, really annoyed me, which is why I give it a 2 star review, but nothing impressed me either.
0446581348|2.0|I was so excited to buy this book and leafed through it to make sure I wanted it. I was disappointed however when I was done reading the whole book. Although Bobbi Brown does give awesome information about skin, I felt that there was a lot of makeup techniques were missing. The book is mostly basic makeup. If you're looking for new techniques, like I was, you should find another book. Great pictures and information for a beginner, just not for me.
B000000WCX|1.0|I'm an old Bowie fan, but I like nine inch nails. I don't have a problem with Bowie going techno.  What  made Bowie great was the story telling, There's no story here. On the opening track he repeats you little wonder 34 times, he repeats the phrase so far away 30 times all rapped around electronic noises and blurbs that make no sense to me. As I listen to the rest of the CD, the same thing. 1 line phrases repeated over and over with noise in the background. What made bowie great was a collection of the some of worlds greatest musicians led by one of the worlds greatest composers. Not here on this CD you get about an hour of non ending electronic drum beats with noise blurbs, not 1 cool guitar riff. I picked this CD up because of the high rating and it's low price on Amazon. I gave up on Bowie several CD's ago this one's no better!
1416575464|4.0|As almost all reviewers have noted, the Domino style is pretty consistent-clean, colorful, eclectic, nothing fussy unless it is tongue-in-cheek over-the-top Baroque. I love the magazine, so I loved the book. I would have appreciated a chapter with photos of a few complete homes, so you could see how the owners made an entire apartment or house look cohesive. If you don't know the magazine, visit their website, [...]. Also, I'd check out [...] . The creator of that site started out with a small book, Apartment Therapy, about his design philosophy, how to streamline spaces in an 8 week exercise, etc. His newer book is Apartment Therapy Presents, with lots of photos and tips, etc. His website features photos of the readers' homes, and great shopping and design tips.
B001L51RQE|3.0|I guess I've burned out on The Police or is this performance lacking? Sting can still hit most of the vocal notes and some of his bass playing is really inspiring, Andy is solid in the rhythm department and burns on some leads but others are sloppy, and Stewart's acrobatic drumming is awesome and he doesn't speed up tempos like he used to. The set list is good, the audio and video excellent, but I feel the band is just going through the motions and some of the music sounds dull. However, \\"Driven to Tears\\" burns and is the highlight of the show. Also, when playing live, Sting likes to arrange songs differently, probably to keep it fresh, and a trio can't pull off the overdubs without additional players. Anyway, I prefer the studio versions, but \\"Walking in your Footsteps\\" is an exception.     The bonus features include a 50-minute film with interviews from the band on their thoughts of the reunion tour, and two picture galleries. I've been a fan of this band from the beginning but am surprised by this DVD because it leaves me with a blah feeling.
B001C46P2A|3.0|I love Australia-the country. I expected way more from the movie. The CGI was horrible. There were few real shots of the beautiful Australian landscape. Nicole Kidman kept losing her English accent. Hugh Jackman totally overdid his Australia accent but looked amazing without a shirt so that was a bonus. I think it came down to Baz Luhrmann. He might not have made some good choices. With such famous/experienced people in the cast, the film should have been better. I liked Bryan Brown because he did not over do it. Brandon Walters and David Gulpilil Ridjimiraril Dalaithngu were amazing!!! I hope they both see my review. They improved the movie tons. The Wizard of Oz parts were fun to see too. I would suggest Steve Irwin's \\"Ghosts of War\\" for those interested in the Pacific conflict between the Allied forces and Japan.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Overall this is a pretty good book. The text is well written and a very informational, however, at times seems to lose focus of the overall topic. Yet despite this minor flaw, this book is a must read. Author Malcolm Gladwell does a wonderful job.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|When asked why he climbed Mt. Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary reportedly replied, \\"Because it's there.\\"  Perhaps the same reply is apropos of Philippe Petit in his magnificent obsession to traverse the yawning chasm between the twin towers of the World Trade Center via tightrope.      \\"Man on Wire\\" traces the daunting logistics and team effort needed to prepare for the tightrope walk, and the many challenges that nearly fragmented the effort.  The film's climax is the breathtaking high wire walk, set to the accompaniment of Erik Satie's \\"Gymnopedia\\", a beautiful blend of music and image that carries viewers to the heights.    That we now know the grim fate of those twin towers 30+ years later lends added poignancy to the memory of the structure's construction and the creative impulse it inspired in others.  In Petit, it inspired a creative yet defiant act of performance art that had no genuine \\"why.\\"  To madmen who hijacked airplanes and the plotters who sent them and others to their death, the twin towers inspired hatred of all that the West symbolized to them.      Philippe Petit became a man on wire to defy convention, to assert his uniqueness and to do something lyrical just for the hell of it.      The movie soars and will take you with it!
B000AXWV40|4.0|Where the first two Funkadelic albums seemed uncomfortably caught between a sort of pretentious coffehouse/jive hybrid and acid-drenched freakout without really seeming to have a comfortable grip on either, \\"Maggot Brain\\" is concise and much more fully realized.  The title track has become a legendary guitar solo and the consensus seems to be that it is this incredibly moving moment.  Personally, I find it boring and tedious, but if you are into the cigarette lighter scene, then have at it.  Eddie Hazel did better work than this later, but this appears to be his \\"signature\\" moment.  \\"Can You Get To That?\\" is a classic track!  A gorgeous, gospel-tinged soul number, very stripped down but it resonates and is beautifully sung.  \\"Hit It And Quit It\\" is a nice, funky rave-up featuring a rare lead vocal from Bernie Worrell, who also contributes a wonderful organ solo.  Billy \\"Bass\\" Nelson contributes a soulful, earnest lead vocal on another classic track- \\"You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks\\"... \\"Super Stupid\\" is as loud and heavy as any Black Sabbath song you'd care to name, except it is played far better... \\"Wars Of Armageddon\\" is a track that deserves respect for being ahead of its time, but its overall listenability is questionable to me 37 years later... While \\"Back in Our Minds\\" is goofy fun... It's a multi-faceted album and the best of early Funkadelic.  As a bonus, this re-issue includes \\"A Whole Lot of B.S.\\" which is a song that does very little for me, to be honest and a stereo mix of the U.S. single \\"I miss my baby\\" which is a track that I really like because of Gary Shider's impassioned vocal-- he makes a mistake here or there but the overall effect is glorious... and of course, just to further flog a long-dead horse, there is another \\"Maggot Brain\\"... This album is the best introduction to early Funkadelic for a casual listener, and it is essential to the hardcore fans.
B001EN71DG|5.0|I noticed that all the one star reviews are from folks that already own the Star Wars films.  I'm just kind of curious...why did you review this item?  Of course the boxed set of the original Star Wars trilogy is only good for people that don't own the original Star Wars trilogy.  If you already own the item, why would you want it again except in another format (like Blu-Ray which I do agree Lucasfilm should have).    Also, I'd just like to point out that this set does actually remastered versions of the original editions from the seventies and eighties.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This CD is definitely worth it! It's not just a Christmas CD, Enya celebrates all of winter. I look forward to listening to this CD for many more months.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a fantastic video.  After just four days of doing level 1 2x per day I can feel changes in my endurance and can see changes in my body.  Jillian is wonderful and inspirational, and the workout really kicks your butt.  At the same time, after I've finished I am always so energized that I wish the workouts were more than twenty minutes.  I'm sleeping better too because this DVD pushes me literally to exhaustion.    I'm at a decent fitness level and I don't know how this would work for someone heavier or with bad joints.  There are a lot of lunges, and I think perhaps that an older person might experience some danger of injury.  Also, Jillian doesn't do the moves with you, but talks to you much of the time.  This annoys me a tad, especially when I'm gasping in agony.    On the whole, this DVD is amazing, and with three levels I don't think its going to be getting old for a while yet!  I'm so excited to move on and do it again.    One thing I would mention: you might want to get two sets of weights.  She uses the same weight for big muscle groups (back) and small muscles (shoulders).  This is misleading, I think.  If I use the same weight for back and deltoids I feel like I'm either not working my back muscles, or I'm in danger of injuring my shoulders from excessive weight.  This isn't weakness on my part, but the basic mechanics of muscle groups.  Get one set of weights that make your back muscles scream and another that burn your shoulders and alternate during the workout.    Good luck!
B001G5IJVK|2.0|Good track listing, Could have squeezed more songs on each volume. I guess Gene and Paul weren't considered Icons after 1980 according to this set. maybe the second set could have Tommy and Eric covering all Ace and Peter tunes. Save your money(Gene and Paul Don't need it!they're too buzy playing in a KISS KOVER BAND) and make your own mix it will be better!
B000SX89ZM|5.0|Hands down My favourite DD album.<br /><br />Nick shines on \\"Tiger Tiger\\" and \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" still sends chills up my spine all these years later.
0307455378|5.0|Esta obra es una joya del suspenso que continúa la línea de La sombra del viento. Retomamos la vida de uno de sus personajes para ver cómo esta se imbrica en la de nuestro protagonista. El autor es un maestro en la narrativa recursiva: esto es, la narrativa en círculos concéntricos. A menudo nos parece haber saltado de un círculo temporal  a otro, sin dejar del todo la trama que llevamos. Cruzamos del presente al remoto o al será con fluidez, con la íntima sospecha de no saber cuánto de nuestras intuiciones hemos puesto en las que describen los personajes. El juego del ángel dará muchas horas de tertulia para los amantes de este tipo de literatura y a los seguidores de la obra de este autor. Excelente.

B000058983|5.0|I know-this needs no detailed intro or extensive review-I'll just say it is one of the greatest albums ever made and it got me through some of my best worst times as a teenager. This album has always been an important piece of work, and I must have listened to it 1000's of times in my life-as a matter of fact I just listened to it in my car! The greatest album by the master mind and GENIUS ARTHUR LEE.
1416575464|5.0|I've seen this magazine a few times and have picked it up as often, so I was thrilled to see that it was available as a Vine product. I live in a huge apartment and I live alone so I was stumped for decorating ideas that really showcased who I was and what I cared about.    This book has it all - ideas for those on a budget to those who can spend whatever and when they want, and you will never run out of ideas, only time!     I highly recommend this book for amateurs AND professionals looking to be even more creative with clients and even themselves.    Five stars!

0743455967|5.0|Stephen King may be thought of as a hack, but one doesn't get that idea after reading about what he thinks of his profession.  The book is chock full of good, simple, insights that will help the writer convey meaning in every word.  The following are the best points he makes.    NEVER WASTE WORDS:  Every word should have a meaning that conveys something to the plot.  There is very little patience for flowery language or tangents that have little to do with the main flow.    SHOW, DON'T TELL:  What every lit major already knows, but very few manage to ever put into practice well.    AVOID ADVERBS:  I somewhat disagreed with this one, as I believe they have more value than he thinks.  However, I agree the word wistfully should never be used.    THINK IN TERMS OF SITUATIONS:  Don't think of grandiose meanings to your book and write it.  Think of a situation that is interesting and let it expand.  The rest will naturally follow.    LET THE CHARACTERS REACT TO THE ENVIRONMENT, NOT HOW YOU WANT THEM TO REACT:  Don't make your characters mouthpieces, make them actual human beings.    If I had a recommendation for Mr. King that he neglected to mention, it would probably be.    THERE IS ROOM FOR SUBLETY:  Anyone who has read a Stephen King book knows he's not too great at this one!      There's plenty more insights in this book, and it's short enough where it's well worth the time of any writer or aspiring writer to read.
B000E1155E|5.0|It's not often that i find a CD where i like every song, but when i was introduced to Arctic Monkeys i was hesitant about whether i would like them or not as i figured just another over hyped British band. After a few plays, they started to grow on me and i have been listening to them ever since. I think they have great talent. If you like this you should check out their DVD live at the Apollo. Also check out The Last Shadow Puppets - Alex Turner's other band project.
B000PY52EU|4.0|I expected \\"Black Snake Moan\\" to be a kind of guilty-pleasure movie, something along the lines of a \\"Death Proof\\", \\"Planet Terror\\", or \\"Kill Bill\\".  You know, trashy fun.  But it's really much better than that.  Yes, it has a half naked girl chained to a radiator.  But it also has two damaged people reaching out to one another, a rich array of supporting characters, a couple of serious themes (in particular, how past abuse informs everything a person does for the rest of their lives), wonderful music, and top-notch acting.  Sure, there's some trashy fun to be had, but it's a shame that the film's marketing team only played up that aspect in the ads and ignored the richer stuff.  The film might have done a little better in theaters.<br /><br />\\"Black Snake Moan\\" looks and sounds great on DVD, and there's a full array of extra features.  Writer/director Craig Brewer is featured prominently in the extras, and he's an interesting guy to listen to.  He's grounded, creative, and has a great sense of showmanship... but not at the expense of knowing what's really important in a film.  I'll have to check out his earlier movie, \\"Hustle & Flow\\", now that I've seen what he can do.
0375842209|5.0|For the first few pages I had to get used to the rather quirky writing style of Zusak and almost put the book down.  But something pulled at me, probably the fact that it's a young adult book and if a young adult could fall into the story then so could a not-so-young adult.  And so I continued reading.  As it turned out it is a beautiful, touching, funny, sad and gentle story filled with people who will be loved for all their foibles and strengths and brilliant fortitude.  I loved every word of it, even the first few pages which I went back and reread once I got the hang of Zusak.  Highly recommended.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|One of the most underrated performers of our time........getting recogniton these days, still not what Iggy and the boys deserved.This album is so great. I struggle between this and Raw Power's greatness and I can't pick a defining album, because their both so different, yet each being as critical to the times and the future of music and bands to come. So what do I do, I love them both. As far as tracks go you won't find a bad one. Dirt and 1970, they rock my world with each listen, the others brilliant. Get the remastered version with the extra disc, you'll be happy you did. The sound rocks and the 2nd disc is so worth the alternate takes, plus you get two tracks Lost in the Future and Slide that are just so worth that 2nd disc alone. Funhouse is just all that. Rock on Iggy!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|By the time I had finally got around to watching this movie, the hype had already cemented itself in my head. 'It's the greatest super hero EVER!', 'It's one of the greatest movies EVER!' Of course, such hype rarely lives up, but I went in wanting to love this movie. While certainly a great uncharted dimension for super hero movies, certain to shape the future of the genre for the foreseeable future (Superman is already to tread the path towards the dark), it does fall short in key places. So first off, my criticisms on why this movie as a whole doesn't live up to the hype. Unfortunately, to fully explore this qualms that seem to solely bother me, I will have to give a spoiler or two.<br /><br />Firstly, the movie strikes a dark and twisted realism that is very well done, giving a certain tone to the film that separates it from others. It's gritty and chilling to say the least. However, with some glaring moments, Nolan leaves some farcical moments in the movie, for me at least, tarnishing the experience, mainly the unrealistically incometent police force. For example: Leaving the Joker with idiotic guard, going into a known death trap under the overpass... the list just goes on. Now of course, the Gothom City police has never been the brightest, but never to this ridiculous extent.<br /><br />Secondly, while it would be inconsistent with the comics, and a few key themes of the movie, I'm just one of those guys that believes in killing the bad guy so he doesn't come back for a sequel, especially in this case. Now, in the 3rd installment if there's even a passing mention of The Joker, or lack of one, you're going to have a massive elephant in the room... because that's right kids, The Joker, terrorist and mass-murderer at large, lives to see another day. Now I might write this off had Ledger not died, but since his unfortunate death, Nolon knew he couldn't bring the character back in any form, so why not just dispense of the character, especially since this presents no inconvenience, since in the last scene, he's on his way down anyhow. Just let him go, and there's no elephant. Also, A Dark Knight would imply some murder to his methods, as is, he's more of a white knight, because he captures and brings to justice.<br /><br />Speaking of the late great Heath Ledger, his performance is not only his best, but worthy of all the hype. If he doesn't win a post-humous Oscar for this role, it would truly be a crime. Ledger not only gives a creepy and psychotic performance that sends chills down your spine, he completely rewrites the book on the character/psychopathic personality. Hannibal Lector almost looks like Santa Clause comparitavely. The rest of the cast is eqally excellent, from Bale to Gyllenhaal, from Caine to Freeman. Aaron Eckhart on the other hand gives a severely underrated performance, as he gives equally spine-chilling scenes... just not to the caliber as Ledger.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I watched the original 1989 \\"Batman.\\" Comparitevely, the once heralded movie now looks even more of a farce, and an all-out comedy. From tone to acting, to story and everything else, there's no comparison as Nolan has taken Batman from farce to brilliant charactacher. But that doesn't mean this movie is the great, as I would even argue Batman Begins is a little better, and Iron Man still ranks as the greatest super hero movie so far. While putting up excellent performances and quite a few jaw-dropping moments, Dark Knight doesn't follow through, and leaves some rather large elephants in the room. Odds are you'll love this movie, but I'd personally would probably only watch it once.since in the last scene, he's on his way down anyhow. Just let him go, and there's no elephant.

1416562591|2.0|White Tiger by Aravind Adiga has already won the Man Booker Prize, and it is being hailed universally by the critics for its virtues in presenting a narrative quite different from the Bollywood capers and the modern Indian English fiction. In the wake of some well-deserved praise, my biased review might appear like an afterthought, examining a foregone conclusion. My bias rises from my familiarity with characters like Balram Halwai, and from my reverence for uncelebrated works of Indian fiction that present the alternative reality of present day India. Reading the novel left me quite dissatisfied, and this is an exposition of the reason why.<br /><br />The basic storyline of the novel can be summarized as follows. Balram Halwai grows up in a poor and remote village and ends up working as the driver for America returned Ashok. Incidentally Ashok is from the family of landlords who run or ruin the life of Balram's fellow villagers. Even though Ashok treats the Balram quite well compared to how servants and drivers are treated by other people, Balram siezes an opportunity to murder his master and run-off with money to become a rich businessmen. The story of Balram's journey from a village to city, the murder and his transformation into a entrepreneur is retold in form of letters that Balram writes in a course of seven nights. The letters are addressed to Chinese Premier and are laced with a dark wit and provocative confessions.<br /><br />The novel succeeds in chartering into a territory unfamiliar and hence exotic for Western audiences, for Adiga chooses a character from lower classes and makes him into a success story. But likewise, the novel fails in providing a deep or authentic representation of his protagonists to anyone who is remotely familiar with the cultural-, social-, caste- & religion- based daily chaos of India. In fact, the parable is replete with the cliched dialogues, observations and methods  which are synonymous with most Indian movies. These too describe the rise of a virtual nobody from village or slums to riches. The only thing missing here is a romance angle, song and dance situations and the victory of good over evil in the final scene. Further, except maybe for Balram, most characters are caricatures, two-dimensional beings, who perform their parts again like the underdeveloped, underused casts in desi movies.<br /><br />The fact that Adiga creates this alternate universe quite cleverly is clear from the outset, but if his representation actually captures injustices or corrupt world ,can be judged best by us who have risen from it. Unfortunately, my assertion that most of the celebrated Indian writers never lived in real India or in the villages, towns and slums (where the poor and middle classes live), applies equally well to Aravind. For me, White Tiger is a black and white, blurred montage of shots from a distant observer. These are accompanied by a narrative that in spite of its comic and creative content, fails to describe what is actually happening. But I am convinced now that to somebody who has access only to this montage, the description provides a wonder and entertainment characteristic of Marco Polo's adventures.<br /><br />The question \\"if not \\"White Tiger\\" than what\\" is not a difficult one to answer. Premchand, Yashpal, Renu, Mahashweta Devi, Dharamveer Bharati, Mulk Raj Anand, R. K. Narayan, Vijayan, Sadat Hasan Manto, Tagore, etc form a long list of writers who have explored the fervent and follies of Indian psyche, philosophy, politics and religion. I thought of the \\"shrub\\" in Bend in the River by V. S. Naipaul, each time I saw Balram's region denoted as \\"Darkness\\", and I thought it unusual that two divers in Delhi run into each other at every possible parking lot (It requires a suspension of disbelief matched by similar plots in many Bollywood movies) . I agree with the book stub that calls it \\"amoral, irreverent\\", but I cannot agree with its being called \\"deeply endearing\\" for I still preserve my sensibility that shocking and irreverent is not a sure sign of being extraordinary. The manifold of contradictions that exist in India requires a canvass with more elements than are present in White Tiger, and to make it palatable is indeed a task that requires more than a paper tiger!<br /><br />Incidentally most of the entrepreneurs, bureaucrats and politicians in current India do rise from very ordinary families. While some may have followed the path exemplified by Balram, there is a significant fraction who escaped through education. While Naipaul did not grow up in India, his House for Mr Biswas contains characters and circumstances that are surprisingly accurate their portrayal of daily life of a large majority of Indians, and there too the escape occurs through education. Rushdie manages to use metaphor and magical realism to assimilate the commotion of Indian existence, but his descriptions do not usually touch the ordinary man.<br /><br />While White Tiger manages to reveal the dark matter in the cosmos of Indian reality, its exposition, extent and complexity  requires the understanding, humanity, attachment and maturity absent in this novel. To win a prize or write a popular book (for Western audiences) is one thing, to create a masterpiece worth universal respect quite another. No wonder most Indians bashed the book in their reviews in amazon and elsewhere, while the Westerners embraced it. For me the scary thing is that an equivalent imaginary novel, which would win similar acclaim in many developing countries (especially in the Middle East), will portray a driver Balram Halwai in United States, making it big (in spite of racial/religious/imperialist insults) by use of similar murder of a Christian, White guy: only the names of the cities and characters need to be changed. Of course, Balram Halwai, of US will also type it as a series of letters to the Chinese Premier. Perhaps that will make for an entertaining read, though I doubt if it will win a Man Booker Prize or such acclaim in the West. My apologies, I won't venture to compare author of White Tiger or the similar, imaginary novel, to Gorky, Gogol or Dostoevsky!ing and irreverent is not a sure sign of being extraordinary.

B000002HAJ|5.0|Wish is beautiful, sad, happy, basically like any Cure album it will take you any place you want to go and maybe places you'd rather not. This is such an honest album. Porl plays wonderful, he is such an important part of The Cure and I was thrilled he has made it back for the new album 4:13 Dream. Robert plays and sounds excellent as always. The lyrics are truly a thing of beauty. I have listened to The Cure for years but it wasn't till this decade that I really took the albums in or maybe they took me in but either way I fully appreciate the many masterpieces Robert has layed upon us. As many thought this was the end, I'm more than thankful it was not because they've given us so much and hopefully more great stuff to come.
0441013597|5.0|Finished my reread of Dune by Frank Herbert.  It still holds up extrememly well--I believe it's The Lord of the Rings for science fiction.      I won't recount the plot here, since there are probably a million reviews of the book and the series, and lots of folks have seen the regrettable David Lynch movie (fortunately for millions of Star Wars fans, Lynch turned down Jedi to direct Dune).  The movie was like looking at something through pavement heat--you can tell what it is that you're supposed to be seeing if you can account for the distortion.  But, I'm biased; I don't understand how Lynch continues to get work.     But I digress.  There are at least two things about Dune that really make the novel stand out against the background of other science fiction novels:    First, the absence of technology.  As part of the backstory of Dune, there was a revolt against computers in humanity's past (our future), and they are banned from society.  This plot convention steers Dune away from where many science fiction works crash and burn--an obsession with technology and \\"technobabble.\\"  Some sci-fi is so tech-heavy that the stories read like stereo instructions.  Sadly, this is a trend which has only gotten worse after the advent of cyberpunk.  Rejecting technology as a crutch allowed Herbert to focus on the humanity of his characters.    Second, the story is character-intensive.  The characters a very well developed, and Herbert develops them with an economy that should make other writers envious.  The exposition in Dune is kept to a minimum, which is remarkable considering the tone that Dune possesses.  Almost alone in the genre, Dune has a voice that's more akin to Homer, Tolkein, or Arthurian legend.  The story is an epic on a grand scale, with nuanced heroes and villains that lack Homer's length (and beauty) or Tolkein's ponderous prose.  The way the characters interact with situations, each other, and even within themselves shows Herbert's skill as a writer.    One helpful note to Dune:  if you've seen the movie, then you know the general idea of the plot.  Go ahead and read the appendices at the back of the book first.  It's not great reading, but it will give a little more backstory that'll make the book easier to understand.      If you haven't seen the movie version of Dune, just start the book from the beginning.  The appendices have a few spoilers in them if you're new to the story.    Dune explores a number of important topics with depth that's rarely acheived in science ficiton:  religion, climate change, human nature, life, death, ecology, among many others.  It's an outstanding read.
1439102813|5.0|I had the pleasure of reading Still Alice a few weeks ago and I absolutely loved it. I truly could not put it down, and got to the point where I was looking forward to riding the subway so I could read it. I finished it in three days with the final stretch keeping me up late in the night. It changed the way I think about aging family members and I won't forget it. I would recommend this to anyone, not just someone who knows firsthand about the disease. As much as you may understand about the disease, it's a very different experience to feel as though you're inside the head of someone suffering with it, seeing how it affects day-to-day life. Those who suffer from this are truly like prisoners in their own minds.    Of all the books I've read this year, this is my favorite by far.

B0001KZM3O|3.0|This is a sound of Waters' watered down Wall, band reluctantly in tow.

For their own sake, Floyd should have stayed true to the title.
0802130208|1.0|I was too annoyed with the main character.    He is this fat annoying man who blames everyone and victimizes himself for every single situation.    I find myself to be able to read through books easily and relate well...  I see the satire in this.    But I was very annoying and I could not find myself continuing this book any further.    I don't recommend this book.

I'm on season 5 now and can't wait to finish the whole series!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I've been watching this movie every year for the past 20 years. This is a must for Christmas time. Classic!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I fell in love with Dr. Horrible and had to immediately buy every incarnation of it. This DVD is awesome, especially the musical commentary. Totally worth it and you won't be disappointed. I hope Joss and Company release the musical commentary as a soundtrack and do a sequel!!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Alright. Now, guys, this is my absolute favorite movie IN THE WORLD. Saw it in theaters twice; went to Wal-Mart the day it came out. The bonus features are, as in all two-disc movies, pretty good, but they could be better.  I'm planning on getting the Wedding Collection edition, but this will have to do for now.  As always, we follow my favorite ladies in all of Manhattan. Mr. Big and Steve are thrown in, of course. Unfortunately, the show was all about SEX. There's barely any of that in this movie; it's all about LOVE.   And I never thought that Sex and the City would have to resort to immature bathroom humor to get more of an important storyline out of the picture. Carrie, whiny as always, has MORE problems with Big; Charlotte doesn't have any real problems in this feature. Miranda, however, has problems with Steve because he cheated on her. Samantha has more shallow and intriguing problems about sex. Of course, I love all of the girls, but Samantha is my favorite, especially in the movie.   Now don't get me wrong, this is an amazing movie with a pretty good storyline and a great guest star (Jennifer Hudson) thrown into the mix. I'm pretty sure the only way it could be better is if it revolved more about the sexual problems the girls were having more than the love problems. All in all, absolutely fantastic.
B0018QCXGY|1.0|This movie sucks! Can't really say it any other way. I saw this movie...low budget, not much plot, RENT FIRST if you really want to see it, otherwise you'll regret it. I don't understand why its in blu ray, you probably won't be able to see much of a difference since the movie is so dark...<br /><br />The movie does a poor job of trying to create a world of terror and horror with cheap movie tricks and bad acting. I wanted to enjoy this movie, because big monster movies are hard to come by these days, especially good ones! This one however, made me want to get a refund of the time I spent watching it.
0439023483|2.0|I thought the first third of this book was very good.  Collins did an excellent job creating a very likable and strong heroine in Katniss.  However, the whole idea of kids killing kids was lost on me.  Our children are inundated with so much violence and gore, that it would be nice to have seen this novel avoid the violence.  Granted, Collins avoided the extreme graphic detail that one associates with adult novels, but I would not recommend this to any reader under the age of 14 or 15.
B001GQACGO|4.0|I enjoy Beyonce more as Sasha Fierce then as herself. The ballads are nice but the upbeat songs are better.
0316017922|4.0|The book was very interesting and engaging, but it seems like most of Gladwell's books, the most interesting material is in the beginning, and much of the book then repeats. I wish this could be more evenly split throughout the work.    All and all, an interesting and easy read and I'd recommend for light reading over a vacation.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|This is 'stand alone' music. You don't need to have seen the movie to appreciate the music in this soundtrack.<br /><br />I have the score. I have the books. I haven't seen the movie, Twilight.<br /><br />Good beat for exercising. Good for casual listening.<br />Five Stars Plus
0486446859|5.0|The quality of this edition cannot be stressed enough. The reproductions of Rackham's illustrations are printed in rich, deep color, making each page an artwork in itself. Every page has a white margin around the illustration, and a quote at the bottom to let you know to what text the illustration refers. The book is well-bound and the printing is excellent. I plan to order another copy for myself, as I got the first to give away and wanted to keep it!
B001DWNUCO|4.0|i saw this movie at some run down cinema a while back.  It good to see it in Blue-ray
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD set is absolutely marvelous.  The filming is exquisite.  Each movie is very detailed and beautiful.  The caves episode was incredible however, just as in every episode you find something just a bit icky.  The caves episode has a scene with a giant pile of bat guano and upon the pile of guano lives a large colony of cockroaches....just a bit over the top for me and this scene was a long and detailed one.  The episode also includes a full behind the scenes look at how they managed to shoot the incredible video.   Overall, though, the beautiful scenery, and great attention to details makes it an educational and enjoyable DVD set.

031606792X|5.0|My wife is currently 7 months along in what has been a truly rough pregnancy and has been spending alot of time resting/reading. Her sister lent her Twilight (the first in the series last Sunday. She started reading the book at 8:00pm and with a few hours of sleep managed to finish it by 1:30pm Monday. She asked for the remaining books in the series for Christmas. I bought them that Monday and by wednesday she had finished the remaining 3 books wishing that there had been more to the series. Said it was the first series in a LONG time to provoke that much \\"lazy time\\"  A+++++++
B00005RIKI|5.0|This is an incredible album. There is no reasonable explanation to give this anything but 5 stars. Which suggests that if this is the yardstick for a 5 star album, the bar has indeed been set very high. Some other albums that are worthy of 5 stars would be Pink Floyd's The Wall, Led Zeppelin IV, and Meatloaf's Bat Out of Hell.<br /><br />If you think about the caliber of these albums you will reach the same conclusion that I have; there are far too many 5 star albums here. Most of what people are 5 staring should in reality be 4 stars.<br /><br />One thing I don't care for on this reissue is the inclusion of the \\"bonus tracks\\". This is true of most reissues it seems. Don't get me wrong re-mastering an album is great but I'm a stickler for authenticity. I want to hear the album as I remember hearing it back when it first came out. Added extra cut's kind of ruins things here. More content does not equal better.
0316017922|4.0|I received this book audiobook from Anna Balasi with Hachette Book Group. This is the first audiobook that I had listened to in a very long time, and boy was I glad that I started with this one. To be honest, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I started listening to it.<br /><br />I found this book to be fascinating! Although some of the things he talks about may seem like common knowledge, for instance the fact that if you look at some of the best in their field and corelate that with the amount of time they spent to get there, you will see something very similar. The best musicians, The Beatles included, owe their success to the amount of time they spent practicing. While this may seem like a \\"duh\\" moment, the way the author brings these facts to light is new and innovative. It really makes you think.<br /><br />There are many aspects of this book that I enjoyed, but quite possibly my favorite was the section on the hockey players and birth order. It actually had me looking on the internet to check birthdates of the \\"best\\" hockey players that ever played the game (by the way, Wayne Gretzky was born on January 26).<br /><br />Truly a thought provoking book and one I would highly recommend!
1400067936|2.0|[..............]<br /><br />This is an interesting idea, and deserves some thought.  Unfortunately, Taleb immediately sets the tone of his book as a pseudo-intellectual examination of the human approach to life and wealth.  He writes about an obscure historical story of King Croesus and Solon.  Solon tells Croesus to not be so proud of his riches, because times can change, and his riches can disappear quickly.  Voila, Solon turns out to be right - Croesus loses a battle to King Cyrus and loses everything he owns.  Taleb celebrates this story's moral as one of his book's finest points: \\"it ain't over till it's over.\\"  My response is: \\"huh!? no shit.\\"<br /><br />Taleb then launches into a discussion of how everyone in the world is \\"fooled by randomness.\\"  He writes chapter upon chapter of pseudo-philosophical discourse on how we leave ourselves open to large risks, often without understanding them.<br /><br />Throughout the entire book, there are really only two points that I remember, or that I considered worth noting:<br /><br />1. Understanding and braving a certain risk is vastly different from blindly pushing ahead and ignoring the downside of your actions.  Taleb makes a point that many people are unfortunately ignorant of various risks and are hence surprised by certain outcomes of their decisions.  He describes a \\"mistake\\" as something that can be decided before an action's outcome is known.  Just because an outcome is positive, that doesn't mean the decision to take the action wasn't a mistake.  In other words, Taleb clearly separates decisions and their outcomes.<br /><br />2. There is a problem with induction.  Often we make generalizations based on data that seem complete but aren't.  His example is that of a \\"black swan.\\"  Those who observed swans everywhere but in Australia came to a conclusion that all swans are white.  However, once a black swan was discovered in Australia, this theory turned out to be false.<br /><br />These two points are excellent and can serve as good food for discussion.  However, Taleb's thesis, combined with these ideas, does not require 300 pages of numerous tangents and irrelevant quotations.  At times, Taleb's writing seems simply like a collection of favorite sayings from other big-name authors.<br /><br />In the last part of the book, Taleb writes about how he himself is also \\"fooled by randomness\\" and is not entirely logical about various things.  While it's admirable of him to admit his own shortcomings, the reader does not need 80 pages of self-searching.<br /><br />[.........................]<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ an interesting view on investment and risk<br />+ contains a few thoughtful discussions (see 2 points above)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- unorganized; has too many tangents and irrelevant quotations<br />- very repetitive, could be cut down to 50-100 pages<br />- written with an annoying \\"better-than-thou\\" attitude (note how one of the tags for this book is \\"humility\\" - hah!)<br />- has too much self-searching and too many references to how Taleb was exercising or spending time in the gym when he thought of something excitingnd can serve as good food for discussion.

B000V86OKG|5.0|If you are like me and miss Six Feet Under, you should not hesitate to buy this DVD. Even though they are completely different, you can still sense the dark humour and Michael C. Hall's BRILLIANT performance. Actually I like all characters; they are all very talented and wear their emotions on their sleeves. When I first read about the storyline, I thought it sounded really boring and unbelievable, and it took me quite a while before I convinced my boyfriend to watch it too. He really hates thrillers and TV-series like ER and CSI. Surprisingly it only took about a couple of episodes before we were both hooked. (We watched all of Sopranos without being too impressed and have yet to finish watching the first season of The Wire even though we bought the DVD a year ago.) They show is on Norwegian television, but has not been mentioned too much in the media and none of my friends watch it - yet. Everyone should! My favourite part is the evil, playful and devilish facial expression of Dexter - it is worth watching only for that! I was afraid they were not able to match the first season, but surprisingly and highly appreciated they still continue to amaze me with their twists and turns and great acting! Hurry up and buy this!
0684853523|5.0|I read Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" quite some time ago. For one: I have never enjoyed Stephen King's novels. However, \\"On Writing\\" brings forth a new Stephen King, one who knows how to teach his craft of writing. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it for would be writers, writers, and certainly for readers who need to know how writers go about becoming writers.  High praise for \\"On Writing.\\" Written well, and truthful. Maybe King should stick to non-fiction!!
031286504X|4.0|The 'I am Legend' compilation is a fabulous book and must be taken on it's own merits and not on one's enjoyment of the 3 subsequent movies (good or bad).  The fact that it was written in 1954 can only make the reader more impressed with Matheson's scientific references and the way in which he weaves mythology with the \\"modern\\".  Although there are other definite classics included, I felt less of an affinity with some of the other short stories until I again reminded myself of the vintage of these tales. A short story like 'Prey'(1969) falls foul of numerous 'Chucky' type 80's horror flicks, the memories of which now permeate ones imagery during the reading of such a story and needless to say, ruins it.<br />But to harp on the negative is futile when the 170 pages of 'I am Legend' are magnificent.  The ending, the very final line, outshines anything that movies have done with this work.  I would however, recommend a viewing of the three movies, 'The last man on Earth', 'Omega Man' and 'I am Legend' as something of interest after reading this book.  That's not to say there's not an absolute lemon in there, but it is interesting to see the treatment of the material from the 1954 text through to 2007.
B00133KFGW|1.0|A preponderance of 5-star reviews for THIS?  The state of the Union is worse than I thought.      This is one of those movies that are so bad they're embarrassing to watch.  At least outrageous clunkers like \\"Tough Guys Don't Dance\\" and \\"Mars Needs Women\\" are good for a laugh.  This phony, complacent, overwrought dreck lacks even that redeeming value.  If a cloying pastiche of clichés like \\"August Rush\\" doesn't insult your intelligence, nothing will.     Freddie Highmore is a talented child actor.  If you're a fan, you'd do better to catch his performance in \\"Finding Neverland,\\" a film worth watching.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|I will never understand why this movie was underrated by the critics or anyone.  Different strokes for different folks I guess.  Just thinking about this movie puts a smile on my face and whenever I need a pick me up or a laugh this is one that I turn to.  Tom Hanks and Shelley Long start out as the sweetest, most loving couple, and the trials and tribulations they go through trying to fix up their house would test anyone.  Hank's facial expressions and reactions to the problems around him, and Long's attempts to be patient and understanding become hysterical as they struggle to stick together until the house is completed.  I could watch this movie once a week and never tire of it, and I laugh until I cry when Hank comes from the kitchen charred and disheveled and when she asks 'what happened'? and he meekly says shaking his head 'it can't hurt us any more', and then the turkey flies out of the exploding oven and soars through the upstairs bathroom and the popper pops up and Shelly happily says 'turkey's done'.  I just bought Peter Sellers' 'The Party' - and to me 'The Money Pit' is far funnier.  Maybe humor is funniest when we can relate to it or it speaks to us.  I love the Money Pit and I thank all those who worked so hard to create that movie and to entertain us.
0312427999|4.0|I just finished this book--no small feat, there's a LOT of information to assimilate--and thought it was astonishing, ground breaking, and essential reading.  I admit that I'm extremely liberal in my political views, but I'm NOT a fanatic, however.  That is, I believe I have an open mind to the extent that I am mostly willing to listen to an opposing view.  My experience is that what I fervently believe today will not necessarily be my truth tomorrow.  I have killed many a \\"sacred cow\\" because I saw, in time, that I clung to them out of fear, or out of allegiance based on faulty or insufficient information.      I recommend this book to anyone who wants detailed explanations for why the world is in such a disastrous economic morass.  Anyone who refutes the cataclysmic agenda/policies of the U.S. government for past 8 years alone needs some shock therapy of his own.      It seems reasonable to assume that the people who might understandably find this book abhorrent are those who have profited from the misfortune or exploitation of others.  If you're not an exploiter--e.g., anyone who knowingly diminishes another man's quality of life for personal enrichment--what motivation would you have to refute what's in this book with such a vehement, vitriolic hatred?  Every argument, especially an economic one, appears to boil down to two perspectives: on one side are those who are primarily interested in preserving \\"me and mine\\"; and on the other, people who believe that everyone has a responsibility for everyone else, particularly for those who can't take care of themselves or adequately stand up for their own best interests.  I'm not alone in thinking that a lot of the world's current misery owes to too many who think that survival of the fittest (which includes the most ruthless methods of rooting out) is the holy grail.    Everyone who writes a book has an agenda: money, fame, or a burning need to tell a story.  Most probably it's a combination of all three.  Even if there are discrepancies in this book (and no one commenting here has claimed to have researched every single fact in the book with documented proof), anyone who reads history and keeps up with current events knows what's going on in the world.  As has been pointed out before, much of the information here is already known, but the way Naomi Klein has connected the dots is truly original and ultimately disturbing.      Despite the erosion of U.S. Constitutional rights by the current administration (not an opinion, this is a FACT), free speech is still my right.  Just a suggestion: make your own case instead of tearing down someone else's.  Debate is always more educational than mud-slinging.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|I bought a copy on vinyl (before I started going to cassette tapes), and I never bothered buying this album on cassette or CD. Then I learned that it was being released as a deluxe double disc set. I've waited long enough, and it was worth it! This was/is my first DL album, and the boys still sound great. [Sadly, we lost Steve Clark, and Rick Allen's left arm. RIP]
B001ACH4DS|5.0|After listening to this CD, I highly reccomend it. It realy showcases David Cook's incredible, flawless singing style with a hard rock edge.  With this album, David Cook has proven he is a certified star.
B001DHXT20|3.0|Let me say straight away, this film is much better than the Ang Lee/Eric Bana mess, but really that's not saying much.  Look, Im no fan of Edward Norton, he's surly, unattractive, and never has any chemistry with his female leads, I suppose maybe they find him as hideous as I do, but I digress.  Honestly, he's not bad in this, Banner is sort of a loner and skin flint, so it works in this role, though again no sparks between he and Tyler.  The Abomination is a great choice as a villian, he's as stong as the Hulk and much more destructive, the Hulk was never as blessed as Spider Man when it came to villian in the Marvel Universe, the Abomination is about as good as he ever got.  I wish he had appeared earlier in the film, we only really get to see him in full form at the end when he tangles with the Hulk.  The million dollar question is..did the CGI Hulk work this time, and in my opinion he did, he looked much more real, though still obviously CGI, but his face was more expressive.  The pace of the film is a bit slow, but not nearly the glacial pace of the Ang Lee film and as it neared the end it really picked up, though ironically I feel the best part of the film was the begining when Banner is chased all over the slums of Rio, yes, it was very \\"Jason Bourne\\", but all action films crib from Bourne these days.  Overall, hardly Ironman, but a pretty good action film, and as a huge Hulk comic fan when I was a kid, Im very grateful about that fact.  Oh and the camios by Lou Ferrigno, Bill Bixby and the iconic Stan Lee are all nice touches.
B000001FI7|5.0|By far the best album Portishead has, i ripped the album at 320kbs and have listened to it so much its near 190kbs. The blend of classic trip hop style and modern sketching is amazing. For any fan of Massive Attack and Portishead and trip hop in general, if you do not have this album, you are missing out.
B001GAOY5U|2.0|You will like the movie, in my opinion, if you watch movies for the special effects and not the plot. Plot is severely lacking. It appears that the production company counted on the special effects in 3D to sell this movie when the approved the script for production.
B001KO3FFW|1.0|This decade has proven to be one of the worst ever for music and this unimaginative CD continues this trend. From what songs I've heard from it on the radio, I can honestly say they are all boring.  I find myself more and more longing for the 70's and 80's when one could listen to a song and know instantly if it was Supertramp or Kansas or Yes.  A time when pieces of work were intellectually, emotionally, and musically superior in every dimension.  This clown and David \\"Monk\\" Archuleta are only fooling themselves and the American public if they think they are bona fide music stars.

0810994739|5.0|These books are laugh out loud funny!  The first was great and the second one was just as good.

I can't say enough good things  about the Wimpy Kid!
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|It has always amazed me how Enya takes essentially the same melodies, and same thematic lyrics, and fashions different songs out of them for her albums. She is able though to create distinct songs, some of which are quite beautiful. This CD is no exception. It is familiar and one can hear the \\"Enya sound\\" all through the recording. But there are times that it comes together very nicely as in songs such as The Spirit of Christmas Past and One Toy Soldier. O Come Emmanuel is simply hauntingly excellent, and really there are enough songs on this CD to make it a great get.Enya is a distinctive artist who in this CD has reminded us of the meaning,the joy,the solemnity, and the spirit of Christmas.
0385338732|5.0|I own and have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books, and this woman has yet to disappoint me.  Her writing is so funny and sharp, and her characters are always so realistic, even the over-the-top ones, like Lexi's husband, Eric.  I found myself in Lexi's position, wanting to love Eric, but ending up completely repulsed, and vice versa with Jon.  I also loved the added twist of all her BFF's hating her, but having her win them back.  The scene with the muffin basket is unforgettable!    Ms. Kinsella, if you're reading this (doubtful!), you're my absolute hero!
B001GQACGO|4.0|To release the same album many times in forms of \\"deluxe editions\\" or \\"platinum editions\\" is a very Beyonce thing to do, it's bad for fans who usually buy her CDs as soon as her album comes out, but for people who haven't bought, it's always good to consider which edition is the best deal.<br /><br />In the case of \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce,\\" this platinum edition should be the best deal, I think.<br /><br />First, it's a CD+DVD combo, the DVD contains all the music videos from this album except for \\"Video Phone\\" that is shot later, while the CD is packed with 20 songs including the single remix of \\"Ego\\" featuring Kanye West, and also \\"Save the Hero,\\" \\"Why Don't You Love Me,\\" and \\"Honesty,\\" which are all previously Japanese-release exclusive.<br /><br />People may ask: \\"Then what about the extended single remix of 'Video Phone' featuring Lady GaGa? It's also a single, why can't we buy the North American exclusive deluxe edition of this album that has 'Video Phone'?\\" It's true, only the newly released North American deluxe edition of \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce\\" has \\"Video Phone\\" feat. Lady GaGa, but remember only this platinum edition has the uncensored version of \\"Ego\\" feat. Kanye West, and if you wanna buy \\"Video Phone\\" feat. Lady GaGa on a CD, you can just buy the German CD single of \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" at a very low price, and in that way, you can own all the songs from this album physically at the lowest price except for only one song \\"Poison,\\" which is only physically available on the North American exclusive deluxe edition.<br /><br />Therefore, if you haven't bought \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce,\\" this platinum edition is your best deal!

B000Q7ZNCW|5.0|HUGE fan of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, love Johnny Depps commitment to character. You don't have to like it, and you are free to express that, but one thing you should get right is... Roald Dahl was a dark intense writer, anyone who has read his collection of classics would know that (Matilda's horrible parents, James' awful, ugly aunts) and tho I loved the Gene Wiler version as a child, and still enjoy it, it wasn't what the Dahl estate expected (notice that it became Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, not Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The Dahls approved this version and were happy with what Burton and Depp did (and Elfman using Dahls words to get the songs so perfect!).    Make your own decision whether you like it or not, I did. But I was also pleased that the family was happy, and that seems more important than fickle fans (and I can't wait to see their billion dollar movies on the screen, since they seem to be experienced filmmakers... judging how they can tear apart everything wrong, lol)
0375826726|5.0|Christopher Paolini continues to amaze me with this book!  I love the way he writes: his word choice, word arrangement, vacabulary, and story line are amazing.  There are a few new twists and turns that happen in this story that leave me spellbound!  If you thought the revelation at the end of Eldest was shocking, wait for the revelation in this book!  There is a bit of graphic battle description and there are many battles in this book.  I just love this writer and this story.  If you HAVE to know the next chapter, then you must read this book.  It leaves you anxiously awaiting the next installment of the Inheritance series.  Great job Chris!

Kirk, Spock, McCoy, all the original crew members, to me, nothing ever beats the feeling of adventure and heroism one experiences when one watches the original crew in action...i know some fans debate whos a better captain, or which series was better or worse, to me, the original started it all, and when it comes to comfortability, thats what ill take. The second film in the big screen series, \\"The Wrath of Khan\\", demonstrates the best of what the legend of Trek is about....people. Sure, dont get me wrong, i love the spaceships, the epic battles, the alien races the crew encounter...but most of all, at its best, Star Trek is about people, and emotions, and the sense of human unity. This is what Gene Roddenbury strived for when he first thought of the idea of the saga. Essentially, its a continuation of the 1967 original series episode \\"Space Seed\\", in which Kirk and crew meet Khan, a genetically engineered superhuman/conqueror from Earth's past. In the film,which takes place 15 yrs later, Khan is seeking vengeance against Kirk for sending him and his followers into exile following an attempted coup against the Enterprise crew. This film was and is always one of my personal favorites due to the fact it touched on human frailty, humanity, the lust for vengeance and the sin of such lust, and most of all, the value of all against the need of just one or a few ( a bit of paraphrasing of an old Spock saying...youll know it when you hear it). The dvd itself contains lots of great features: extended director commentary, a look at the visual effects used in the film, interviews with cast and crew, etc, etc....overall, an amazing piece of pop entertainment that doesnt insult its fans, but embraces them and their love for that entertainment.ertainment.
B00008DDSC|4.0|The Bottom Line:    An interesting take on the boy-meets-girl tale (with a bit of spanking involved), Secretary is well-acted and heartily recommended to anyone who wants a movie that's a little different than the norm.
B001GQACGO|3.0|I was hoping the the Sasha Fierce cd would have some hot dance songs, but it didn't other than Single Ldies.  I think Mrs. B. was trying to hard to prove she is a great pop singer and not an R&B artist.  I love the first cd, but Sasha Fierce is not so fierce, so the cd gets three stars.
0316017922|3.0|If you've come here thinking that Malcolm Gladwell's latest book could well be a repeat of his previous two instalments, then you are going to go away disappointed. This is definitely not in the same league as the previous two books.  It starts with an interesting argument, and of course, some interesting data, just to 'suck you in'. But Mr Gladwell fails to take the argument to a conclusion. The data of course is interesting but it fails to convince. It probably reinforces that there is indeed a million ways to interpret data, but really, this is data without a purpose.  Outliers is worth a read, if only to compare it to the previous books - I don't think I'm labouring the point too much, because clearly this book is intended to shine in the reflected light of the previous publications. Mr Gladwell is working hard to keep the franchise alive - similiar covers, typefaces, layout etc, but really, the subject matter is very light weight.  If you enjoyed the previous books, go ahead and buy this one, but don't expect the thrill and engagement you experienced in the first two to be repeated.  It would make a nice Christmas gift for someone though!
B000001EG6|5.0|Like many, I discovered Elton John through the wonderful lyrics and singing of Your Song on a 45 and rather dismissed the album. Recently, I purchased the remastered version and what a glorious re-discovery. The new version brings out the lusciousness of the sound, with its use of an orchestra and a choir that enhances many fine pieces, such as the lovely the Greatest Discovery. While lyrics on Take Me to the Pilot seem absurdly dated, such songs as the Border Song remain very much present with its still much needed cry for tolerance and I Need You to Turn To and of course Your Song remain two of Elton John's greatest love songs. And this is where Elton John really became known and his collaboration with Bernie Taupin started to flourish so three thumbs up. Go buy this remastered version, throw away the old vinyl or cassette, and hear it as it sounded crisp and beautifully melodic and so fresh.
B0000AFX64|2.0|I remember first watching this series as a young teen and I really enjoyed it.  I actually prefered it to all the Star Wars mania that was going on around me and I really liked the characters especially Starbuck and I thought the uniforms and the fighter planes were a lot cooler than anything the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises could offer at least at the time.  I hated the dagget and the irritating kid and I didn't miss Athena although I did wonder at times what happened to her but overall I have very good memories of the entire series.<br /><br />I decided to just get a dvd that will help me recall those days without having to spend a bomb and so I got this \\"movie\\" version which is really a cut and paste of the pilot and a couple of episodes.  That in itself isn't bad but the dirty trick of making a \\"widescreen\\" version by mutilating a full-screen version is appalling and disgraceful behaviour.  The picture quality is also poor on this disc as it hasn't been restored and the sound quality is also disappointing as it comes only in mono.<br /><br />For those who like me don't want to get the entire series but just want a better version of this will have to wait until they restore the picture quality, remaster the sound with at least 5.1 surround sound options and add some good Special Features in either the standard or preferably the Blu-ray format.  Incidentally, I hate the new series which casts my favourite original character Starbuck as some kind of perpetual PMS female dog.  Also, where are the Cylons?  It's now a rip-off of Species 2 or the Blade Runner where the villain looks just like us.  Really stupid and they should just give the series another name as it is a totally different animal.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|After [[ASIN:B0002Y6GT8 Live at BB King Blues Club]] and [[ASIN:B000P28RAS Official Bootleg USA '06]], two live releases from Beck that were expensive and varied in quality, it's definitely an early Christmas present to receive a new, reasonably priced, and consistently hot live set from this king of the stings.    The expected tracks are here, and the set list mixes it up enough so that even if you do own the other two live CDs, you're not getting a \\"re-tread\\" here.    Beck's post-Yardbirds success...with the possible exception of the first \\"Jeff Beck Group\\" featuring Rod Stewart and Ron Wood...has always been brighter in the realm of instrumental albums like [[ASIN:B00005AREQ Blow by Blow]], [[ASIN:B00005AREP Wired]], and [[ASIN:B0000025EY There and Back]]. On this album, he simply goes with his strengths for an unrelenting 70 minutes...and when you're Jeff Beck, those strengths result in a house full of dropped jaws. Buy it.
1595141715|5.0|Let me just say that I think Jay Asher is the next big author. He's got talent. Anyone who can take the simple idea of a suicide and the 13 reasons why the person did it, but do in such a creative and appealing way, was major talent. I was also touched by the description of how Hannah gets annoyed by the littlest things, like a boy touching her leg. It drives me crazy too! I'm not your average girl either, so I guess it makes sense. Anyways, It's a good book that gives you a peek into the life of a girl, who is extremely different, in her own sense; kinda like me, but I'm deffinatley not suicidal. Anyone who dislikes this book, just isn't capable of seeing the fact that Hannah is just different and if you can't pick that up in a fictional book, then how can you pick it up real lfe? If I confused you, sorry.
B001F290E4|5.0|I would never had thought I would purchase a Seal albulm. Did not care for his type of music, but the cd is excellent. Took me back
0545128285|4.0|I read the book in one sitting, the stories were interesting, and i think if one was to really think about them, they reveal a lot about the mind of JKR and the Harry Potter world.     Each story tells a \\"moral\\" tale of how magic is supposed to be used and how it is not supposed to be used. As Fairy tales are supposed to scare children into doing the right thing or teach them some moral.     She does both, the stories are unique in their own way, yet they are not. The book is to show how in Book Seven, Harry and Hermione discover the \\"death stick\\" and how his cloak came into being, ect.    The book is for older children and is interesting for fans of the series. But overall, the book does not really, as far as i can tell, really offer anything substantial to the series.
0375507256|5.0|this book is visionary. five different stories woven together with five completely different voices, dialects, and time periods. each story could have worked as its own successful book but together, it becomes impossible to put down. each main character is drawn with enough complexity that they will stick with you throughout your day. from a film noir about a journalist fighting corruption to a science fiction prison story to a post-apocalyptic future on a tribal island to a 19th century expedition by sea, this should be a cult phenomena. based on this book, I plan to read everything Mitchell has ever written.
0425220931|5.0|The Music Lesson is a wonderful book that is full of interesting and useful ideas about music herself. Every Bass player must read this book, it helped my bass playing tremendously. Even if you do not play bass,this book will be very helpful to you. This is not the standard music book, there almost no music theory, scales, or exercises, instead this book talks about the spiritual aspect of music. I highly encourage any musician at any level to read this book, several times. It will change many things that you thought music was or could be, and it will improve your playing.
B000RZGIQ8|3.0|I have this in DVD and Blue-Ray. Keep the DVD. The picture & sound is no different than the DVD. I watched this wanting this to make me smile. It never did. Rent this first & save some money.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Just watched this from Netflix. I was raised by parents that enjoyed and believed that as children we should be exposed to music in all forms and that included musical pictures(movies duh... with music). We got it all. Annie get your gun, Brigadoon(favorite of a ballet brother, and on and on.) Legacy of a musical mother. Now in my opinion this a great movie. Best I have seen in years. Period. Just bought it too. Can't wait to see it again. Those bum reviews in my opinion are just those poor souls that have no appreciation for a GREAT musical. Fantastic flow and story is magical. Great work to all involved. Nice cameo by the Abba boys on the cloud at the conclusion.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD 2 weeks ago after barely working out all year (before this year I was working out about 4 times a week).  It kicked my butt but it is only 20 minutes, so you can push yourself through it.  There are 3 circuits - each features 3 minutes of Strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs.  There is short warm up and cool down too.    I have been doing level one for two weeks (done it about 7 times) and have being doing Ultimate Tae Bo the other days.  I am more tired in the 20 minutes of 30 day shred then the hour and a half of Ultimate Tae Bo (which I also like a lot).  Last night, I noticed a huge improvement from where I started.  With the exception of anterior raises with a lunge, I was able to get every rep in for every exercise.  I couldn't do this 2 weeks ago.    Jillian makes the point that if you want big results in 20 minutes you are going to have to push yourself during the workout.  The fact that it is 20 minutes makes it so much more manageable.  I basically force myself to do it before I know I have to shower.  What I also like about this is that there are three distinct workouts, level 1, 2, and 3.  I think next week I will be able to move on to level 2.    I definately recommend this.  It isn't easy but you quickly get stronger and your stamina will increase.  It has only been 2 weeks, so I haven't notice major physical changes.  I do have more energy, think my waist is a little trimmer, but more importantly I don't dread doing this, so think that I can stick with it.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I have loved every single Nickelback CD I own, and this is no exception...I have to say this is one of my favorites!
B000M4RG42|2.0|In Flags of Our Fathers, director Clint Eastwood attempts to deliver a stirring and thought provoking film that honors the sacrifices made by the veterans of World War II, while at the same time fixing a critical gaze on the U.S. government for their exploitation of those vets to promote public support of the war.  Kudos to Clint for thinking big, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew in this case.<br /><br />The movie shifts back and forth between the bloody battle of Iwo Jima, where we watch young men afraid and dying as they fight for each other more so than their county and, the home front where three soldiers who were part of the iconic flag raising picture travel around the country encouraging people to support the war.  The idea that the movie is driving at is that the photo, considered one of the most famous of the 20th century, wasn't what the public thought it was.  It was actually a picture of soldiers replacing the initial flag that was planted.  The soldiers in the picture never felt that their flag raising act was heroic, but that's how the government wanted it spun in order to keep hope alive among the masses.<br /><br />The movie attempts to portray the conflicted emotions carried by the soldiers as they play the role of heroes even though they know the truth, but none of the characters is developed well enough to make us care about what they are feeling.  As for the war scenes, they are well done but they feel like Saving Private Ryan warmed over.  There is no immedicacy or fear.  Eastwood isn't able to put you there in the thick of things the way Speilberg did.<br /><br />The end result is a movie that often feels muddled and confused and lacks a center.  It's a movie about ideas and questions, but it forgets to engage the audience in any real or meaningful way.
B001GQACGO|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I must admit that before b'Day i wasnt that much of a Beyonce fan, but her last 2 CD's have been a smash hit. I am a little lost on the spliting up of the two CD's but I can listen to both of them front to back. Loved it, and I would suggest everyone go and buy this CD.......Can't wait for the next one.....
B001ACH4DS|5.0|What's not to love.  This is a great CD and I expected nothing less.  Can't wait for his next one!!
B001KVZ6DE|4.0|So it averages out to 4 stars then.   The music is just great with many key blues performances from Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Etta James, Howlin'Wolf and Willie Dixon recreated. The story is a blend of fiction and fact and one wonders why the half truths and lies had to find their way into the story. Just a few of the \\"mistruths\\":  -There were 2 Chess Brothers, not just one and both had a strong involvement in the company.  - Len Chess died 2 months after he sold his company not just after stepping foot outside the door.  -Etta James did not record \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" in Chicago although she did record her composition for the Chess label.  -Etta had already been a star for 5 years prior to joining Chess.           -Len Chess did actually serve as a session musician if the situation demanded it.  -The Chess company recorded many other musicians and styles during their career.  -Whether Chess ever dated Etta James is debatable. She had a boyfriend who was writing some of her best material at the time.  - Chess operated in a few smaller buildings before moving to 2120 South Michigam Ave in 1955.   A thorough account on what is true and what is not would no doubt reveal countless other mistruths. The question is why does Hollywood have to falsify and dress up the facts when a simple report on the facts would have been so much better. Still, the music in this movie is a blues fan's dream and credit must be given for that.
B0000256VK|5.0|Having heard a bit about Roxy Music and enjoying some of their music, I finally took the plunge and purchased one of their cds, in this case the outstanding album \\"Avalon\\".  Brian Ferry and company have put together something that really harkens to the 80s but yet is so timeless.  The entire album flows with the perfect simplicity that only great albums do.  Starting off with the hip, upbeat, almost ethereal \\"More Than This\\", Roxy Music leads the listener into a room of new wave bossanova, and hip noire and never varies from true artistry.  The title track \\"Avalon\\" keeps a simple samba beat, bringing to mind the empty ballroom after a long party, a couple dancing on the dance floor.  \\"India\\" is one of the very short instrumentals, sweet but all too brief.  \\"While My Heart Is Still Beating\\" is a great moody piece.  \\"Take A Chance With Me\\" starts off kind of cold and distant, but warms to a nice sunny tune that will have you whistling right along with it. \\"To Turn You On\\" is a song of aching longing.  \\"True To Life\\" is another song that really brings back memories of the 80's new wave style, then \\"Tara\\", another short instrumental gently brings the cd to a close.    For anyone who has not heard anything by Roxy Music I can't make a higher recommendation than to try this cd.  I think you will enjoy it.  5 stars.
B000025XKM|5.0|It's hard to explain to someone why you like Nick Drake. People either hear the unique talent or they don't. To say he has a cult following today is an understatement.   In all his songs there is a soft gentle vocal wrapped around an intricate guitar arrangement. 2 of the better examples of this would be the title cut and \\"Place to Be\\". Listening to his music all these years later, it's hard to see how radio missed this wonderful artist.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This is, no doubt, my favorite Ron Howard movie ever.  The drama, the acting, the actors, the plot, everything about it is fantastic.  Russell Crowe is magnificent in this movie.  He is convincing, serious, and perfect for the role of John Nash, the famous mathemagician.  No one could've been better in this role than Russell Crowe, it's as though he Ron Howard made this movie just for Russell Crowe.  Definate best picture movie.  Not my favorite, but definately one of my favorites, like right under my favorite.  Anyone who hasen't seen this movie must see it, trust me, it's definately worth it.
B000PY520E|5.0|Remember this was a 70's movie.  I watched it on my PS3 and Samsung HD TV.  Great effects.  Can be a collector's item.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie is really great.  It doesn't seem much like a best picture movie, but who cares, it's an awesome movie!  It is very disturbing, depressing, and serious.  It's supposed to be a comedy-drama, but if you ask me, it's mostly a drama, not to say it isn't funny, it's just very serious, especially at the end.  They said before I saw it that the movie would get stuck in my head for days.  It concerned me forever.  Of course, they said the same thing for Million Dollar Baby, but that didn't concern me that much, that is, not as much as it would've if I haden't seen Scary Movie 4.  But still, those who haven't seen this movie, see it, it's a great best picture movie.  The acting is great, Kevin Spacey won an oscar for it.  The actors, such as Chris Cooper, are very convincing in the movie.  The movie is dark, depressing, and disturbing.  I know i've already said that, but it's just so true, still, it may spook you, not that it's a horror, it is, however, very, well, you know, but it's still a very good, dark film, so give it a chance.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|I just recently heard of Gojira a couple of months ago and i loved the sound and lyrics that came out of this band. To me the music sounds like Tool mixed with Morbid Angel but played faster and darker. Another unique thing about this band is that is you read the lyrics, they somewhat put out a positive message about the world we live in and how to improve our lives. I'd recommend this album to any death metal lover.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Out of all the other Blu-Ray movies i own, this is by far the best collection that anybody has to own. The picture, sound, pretty much everything about The Matrix Collection is perfect. I would highly recommend anyone into buying this on Blu-Ray.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|I bought this movie today on blu-ray and I must say that I am impressed! The action is intense and the picture is crystal clear! While the storyline is kind of predictable, it does not take away from the sheer intensity of this movie.  Jason Statham is brilliant as well as Ian McShane, who i remember from Deadwood.  This is a very good movie!.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|This was my first taste of Slipknot and I enjoyed it very much. I would definetely recomend this CD.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|A close friend that I normally agree with on most everything told me that this cd was just not good.  Well, I heard the first single (4 Minutes featuring Justin Timberlake) and loved it, so I thought, hey, it's on sale, why not give it a try and boy am I glad I did!  I am one of the fans that love Madonna to be on the dancefloor and for her swan song for the WB folks thats exactly where she is: DANCING!  All twelve tracks are very good, if you are one of her early fans and really miss the Clubbing Madge, well this is THE disc for you.  Get you some Hard Candy and give it a good, long LICK! No calories involved.
0316017922|4.0|Outliers is a fascinating and surprisingly easy read, considering the complexity of the topic. Gladwell disaggregates data on a variety of seemingly unrelated themes (yes, I'm a huge nerd for loving this) and weaves it into a suspenseful narrative. His critics complain that Gladwell's points are less than well-substantiated, but those accusations don't undermine the reasonable evidence that supports his ideas, nor do they detract from the compelling nature of the patterns Gladwell exposes (which are, without exception, thought-provoking).<br /><br />Gladwell's purpose in Outliers is to contrast how success has been perceived culturally with the factors that actually contribute to becoming successful. His examples are not always intended to have educational implications, such as the chapter on why certain airlines have higher crash rates than others (would you believe, the culturally-based deferential treatment of the captain by the first officer? Fascinating.) But nearly every chapter inadvertently caused me to re-evaluate our educational norms and expectations.<br /><br />For example, Gladwell establishes in the beginning of the book how children are punished by the age cut-offs established by school systems (students born right before the cut-off will lag behind their peers who are nearly a year older, and have to compensate for their disadvantage all the way through high school). It is inherently unfair to expect a child who is 7.1 years old to read at the same level as a child who is 7.10. This is a self-evident fact, yet few (beyond the Montessori movement) have taken any real steps to correct this problem. As a result, we set up children for years of struggle and failure based solely on the month in which they were born.<br /><br />Gladwell also notes how the differences in parenting styles affect success. This is a well-known fact, especially among those of us who work with children, but the Outliers interpretation offers some considerations which are difficult for us to quantify and express:<br /><br />\\"The middle-class parenting style is typically one of 'concerted cultivation', an attempt to actively foster and assess a child's talents, opinions, and skills. Poor parents tend to follow, by contrast, a strategy of 'accomplishment of natural growth'. They see as their responsibility to care for their children but to let them grow and develop on their own (skills and interests are character traits which make the child who s/he is, not as a signal to look for other ways to develop that interest into a formal talent).\\"<br /><br />But perhaps the most important chapter for educators appears at the end of the book. Gladwell analyzes data showing the gains that upper class children make during the long summer vacation each year and charts the losses that lower class children suffer. The contrast is impossible to ignore: children from wealthy families benefit from concerted cultivation for two and a half months, while poor children languish in the front of the TV day after day after day. While Gladwell only analyzes data from Baltimore city schools, I'd be highly surprised if different conclusions could be drawn from any other studies:<br /><br />\\"An enormous amount of time is spent talking about reducing class size, rewriting curricula, buying every student a shiny new laptop, and increasing school funding--all of which assumes that there is something fundamentally wrong with the job that schools are doing. But look back at the second table [of Baltimore City data], which shows what happens between September and June. Schools work. The only problem with school, for the kids who aren't achieving, is that there isn't enough of it.\\"<br /><br />This is a consideration which would revolutionize American education: the abolishment of summer vacation under the premise that children will learn more if they're provided with enough of the right opportunities. Imagine diverting funds from endless assessment and swinging pendulum reforminitiatives, and using that money to employ teachers for an extra six weeks of best-practice instruction every year. What would YOUR students know if you had an extra 210 hours to teach them?<br /><br />Whether or not you believe whole-heartedly in the legitimacy of the patterns Gladwell has pieced together, there are clearly some legitimate points which are worthy of our consideration. Outliers will challenge you to consider the factors that are working for and against the success of our students. As Gladwell explains,<br /><br />\\"Because we so profoundly personalize success, we miss opportunities to lift others onto the top rung. We make rules that frustrate achievement. We prematurely write people off as failures. We are too much in awe of those who succeed and far too dismissive of those who fail. And, most of all, we become much too passive. We overlook just how large a role we all play--and by \\"we\\" I mean society--in determining who makes it and who doesn't.\\"<br /><br />Originally posted on the author's blog.<br />From the author of: [[ASIN:1606473670 The Cornerstone: Classroom Management That Makes Teaching More Effective, Efficient, and Enjoyable]]r an extra six weeks of best-practice instruction every year.

B001NY7G5E|5.0|Kind of a biased review, because I consider every Prison Break episode some of the most exciting, edge of your seat, drama episodes EVER on Network television.      PRISON BREAK is Great!!    The ONLY problem ever with P.B. was when the writers went on strike last year and it went from a 22episode show to a 13, and the episodes they did do were saturated with commercials.   But even a limited show is better than no show.
0545128285|1.0|The only thing good about this book is that apparently all proceeds are going to support a children's charity.  Buy the book, but don't bother to read it.  Because I think the author has such a fantastic imagination, I was sure I was going to be charmed by a collection of short stories.  But no - the stories were too short, and the book too much a commercial project and no more.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I have read the first couple of pages of the reviews and am surprised that no-one has yet made the comparison to Logans Run, the 70s sci-fi classic, where Michael Yorke is a Sandman, an emotionless cop tasked with killing \\"runners\\", people who try and escape the domed city the story is set in to avoid being forcibly terminated on their 30th birthdays. Logan tasked with infiltrating the resistance begins to empathise with them and becomes a runner himself. Sounds familiar?     Equilibrium obviously tries to cash in on the Matrix but they are very different films, both in terms of budget and premise. This film looks very stylish and revolves far more around the characterisation, costumes and cinematography, as obviously the budget was limited. And the director does a fantastic job in creating the dystopic future and capturing the set piece battles. Even the startling way the film is shot, lots of black and white costumes with a lack of colour enhances the look and feel of the film. It really is a nice piece of work and you can watch and enjoy this even if you think the Matrix is the greatest film ever (and of course, it is pretty amazing.)    The plot as many people have pointed out is a little shaky and the premise of the film doesn't really hold up to over scrutiny, but it is sci-fi, the \\"fi\\" bit being \\"fiction\\" which means we should allow the director to present his world and accept it for what it is. Personally, I like the \\"gun-kata\\", its one of those pieces of \\"film-science\\" that makes you think that \\"hmmm, maybe its possible\\". I remember at a job interview for the Defence Research Agency many years ago being told about some one who had attempted to break down aerial combat into a set of algorithms so that an aircrafts computer could calculate the probability of a successful engagement and inform the pilot. If this was true, the \\"gun-kata\\" might not seem so terribly far-fetched.       Bale is of course immense, you could put him in the tellytubbies and he would probably binge eat for 6 months and paint himself purple to get into role. He is ably supported by a cast of British and Irish actors including \\"Beaner\\" who is the working mans Sean Connery.     This film could have been crap, but it isn't. It is really really good, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B001N4RORE|5.0|Couple friends and I bought the movie. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen!!! The scenery is incredible, the music just picks you up. You cant help to smile from start to finish!
B00004VVNB|4.0|The story is pretty good, the acting ok, the sets are a product of their time. Look, it is virtually impossible to make a film, particularly a sci-fi one and not have it look dated 20 years later. I know its unfair to compare but you will bust a gut laughing at early 1970s Dr Who's where the idea of futuristic transport was a Citroen Diane with the doors taken off, and crewed by 4 camp looking blokes in berets and capes. Tears are rolling down my face as I think of it. Anyway. 2001, Blade Runner, Star Wars - still look good today. Not much else does though. Back to Logans Run, all you need to know is Jenny Agutter gets nuddy in it. How cool is that?       PS - I noted some comment about the sandmens guns being unrealistic. Well, on my first night excercise, I started firing my semi-auto Self Loading Rifle (SLR) which had a blank firing attachment on it (which provides enough back pressure to operate the working parts of the rifle when using blanks) and lo and behold, 4 tongues of flame shot out of the flash eliminator ports just like in Logans Run, which was great for sci-fi reminiscence but rubbish for my night vision. So there you go, not unrealistic at all.

Hey Martel, you hack!  Give me back my money!
B0006ZFQP8|3.0|Wagner wanted two singers in the roles of Tristan and Isolde who could be credible young lovers and also sing in a legato Italian style. However, he wrote vocal parts that only heavy-voiced heldentenors and dramatic sopranos had enough staminia for. Kleiber decided to solve this dilemma through the magic of the microphone.  You may think it works; I am not so sure.<br /><br />Margaret Price began as a Mozart singer, a Pamina whose lyric soprano gained more weight in later years. She has a uniquely fruity, somewhat hooty voice that still manages to sound rich, and she is very feminine. She oculd no more sing Isolde on stage than Kathleen Battle could sing Aida, but she gives it a game try here. Even in a studio under miked conditions, however, she doesn't sound right to me; the volume is there, thanks to the engineers, but you don't hear a true Isolde of stature and emotional weight.<br /><br />Kollo is ocnsiderably more disappointing. He did sing Tristan on stage (or am I fantasizing that?), but he is possessed of a dry tone and often forces. He has no legato and not the slightest heroic \\"carry\\" to convince you that he is riding over a big orchestra.<br /><br />Both lead singers do their best, and in aid of making this a thoroughly modern Tristan, as opposed to Furtwangler's richly traditional one, Kleiber keeps the pace going, sometimes at a fast clip.  There is no denying his inspiration, and for a while I htought I oculd appreciate the conducting and ignore weaknesses in the rest. In the end, however, a Tristan without two credible leads wasn't a success. DG's digital original had a good deal of glare, so buying the latest remastering makes sense if the price is competitive.
B00003CXTG|1.0|While I have little regard for Roger Ebert's opinion on movies or anything else, he did pretty much nail this movie by dismissing it as the story of how the Japanese Navy interrupted a love triangle. This movie is an incredible trivialization of such an important historical event.  It is also a fictional version. Doris Miller's actions were heroic, but he did not shoot down any Japanese planes. The pilots on whom the characters played by Ben \\"Aflac\\" and the other actor whose name escapes me were based did not down three Japanese planes by playing chicken with them. The attacking Japanese planes did not zip in and out and around ships and buildings like Star Wars TIE fighters.   But why am I even bothering to go into this much detail? The movie is horrible. Leave it at that.
0793518326|3.0|Just received this book as a gift. I put it on my Wish List because I thought it was the same book I saw at the Mirage's gift shop in Las Vegas. They had a nice big (expensive) book with all the Beatle's songs and I thought this was it.    Unfortunately, as soon as I opened this and thumbed through it I realized this was not it. The print is small, and not easy to see if you are holding a guitar. There is also an unusual font used instead of normal fonts that are much easier to read.    For me, I liked the fact that they have the Tabs for both guitars but I would have liked to see what the chords being used at the top are supposed to look like. As a hobbyist player when I discover new chords it would help me to know what fingers go where.  But they do show the Lead guitar bits, which is a plus, however some are absent or incomplete.    The book is also in alphabetical order and not arranged by album or chronological order. That means lots of flipping around through this 1136 page book! Be prepared to buy some of those page marking Post-its to make it easier to find those songs you like.  I don't think its a bad book, but it is more of a reference book and not the best thing for someone who wants to learn each Beatles songs. For that stick to bigger, magazine sized soft back books that are album specific.
031606792X|5.0|I've read all the books and I loved all of them! I'm not disapointed in the ending.. I was hoping for a happy one.. I'd fallen in love with all the characters and didn't want to see any of them go!  I am pretty upset with all the bad reviews written about this book.. I thought it had good twists, good ideas, and it was quite humorous! I can't wait for the rest of the movies! and Stop pickin apart this book and just enjoy the happily ever after!
031606792X|1.0|I was so excited to read this book after reading the first three.    SPOILER ALERT    Yeah, so Bella and Edward get married and go on their honeymoon. They have sex and Bella starts shamefully begging for more. She ultimately finds a reason to stay human for a few more years(sex). Bella becomes pregnant and everyone starts freaking out. They want to remove the baby but Bella wants to keep it and doesn't understand why they are worried.     I don't understand how she could get pregnant. Apparently vampires don't need to breathe, don't have a heartbeat, but can impregnate humans.     Also, I find that a book is less enjoyable when the protaganist gets on your nerves. After begging for sex, whining, and wanting to allow the vampire baby to grow inside her, I'm starting to dislike her.....a lot. I mean she was cool in the first three book but now she is way too needy and her whole persona seemed to change.     Anyway, I took a break from reading the book to find a reason to continue because quite frankly, this book is boring me.

B0016Q2D5M|1.0|The 3D version just plain did not work. The colors were distorted as everything was green or magenta, the images were blurry, and it was overall annoying. Parts of it did work in 3D, but the overall picture detracted from the effect.     I tried to return this and was told to contact New Line since it is a production problem and not a store problem. Please contact me if you have been successful in obtaining a refund from New Line and let me know what the process is. I would encourage others who are not impressed with the 3D format to contact New Line as well.
B001C46P2A|5.0|War's imminent, but Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) is tired of waiting for her husband Maitland to sell his Australian property and return home to her.  Despite her husband's admonitions, she flies to Darwin on a mission to convince Lord Ashley to sell Faraway Downs and come home to England.      She lands in the middle of a cattle war.  King Carney (Bryan Brown) owns all the cattle ranches in the territory save for Faraway Downs, which he's trying to put into enough straits to make the owner sell with the help of Neil Fletcher (David Wenham) who ostensibly is the manager of Faraway Downs, but has been helping Carney siphon off cattle across the Billabong River for quite some time.     Lady Ashley's husband Maitland is dead, supposedly the victim of a Aborigene spear.  But, she's seen the other set of books that Fletcher's beeng keeping for Lord Carney.  Lady Ashley fires Fletcher.      Now the race is on.  In order to survive, Lady Ashley's got to drive 1500 head of cattle to Darwin to sell them for the Army contract ahead of King Carney.    And war has broken out and it's coming to Australia.  The police want to take Nullah (Brandon Walters) away from Faraway Downs, because the boy is a 'creamy' or a half-cast (half Aborigene and half white).  While Lady Sarah is not a drop maternal, she's fallen for the boy and for Drover (Hugh Jackman) who's contracted to help her get the cattle to Darwin.     The story's much more than this.  \\"Australia\\" has all the ingredients of a good Western, an excellent war film and a fine romance all tied up into a fairly elegant package.  Add to that, one of the most compelling performances by young Brandon Walters I've seen.      Warning:  take your tissue with you and don't get a large drink.  The movie's long and you're not going to want to leave, either to wipe your eyes or go to the restroom. This one, I am going to want to own in Blu Ray.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2008
B001GQ2TGA|2.0|As Enya couldn't be more creative I'll just copy and paste Antonio Acuna's review, which express word by word my feelings. There you go.<br />\\"Hard to start a review that many will hate, but I'll try. I have to firstly admit openly that I love Enya's music, I would not say everything she has done is brilliant, but the largest bulk of her production is superb and groundbreaking in many ways. I began getting disillusioned with Enya's musical direction with 'A day without rain', Although I like the songs and find moments of true genius in all of them, I felt betrayed by the sparse instrumentation and the fixed formula (verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus) It became so marked that I could tell you where the bridge was in any of the songs by just sliding the progress bar past the middle of the song. In one word, I missed the complexity/simplicity she achieved before. Amaranthine was no better, besides Water Shows the Hidden Heart, sumiregusa and It's in the Rain, the rest was repetitious and the same, thin instrumental arrangements, in a way the anathema of what her musical style stood for. Well, And winter came is no solution to this. Firstly, a 'xmas' album is not one high on my list, as much as I love xmas, if I want the sound of xmas I'll get the Cambridge singers doing traditional carols, besides she already released the sound of the seasons not too long ago, that should have been enough. Here we have the same repetitive structures with the sparse musical accompaniment, so thin that sometimes I want to yell 'for the love of God Enya, get some new instruments!'. Mind you, the album is good, some of these songs are lovely songs, well made, with great vocal mastery and all that, but for someone breaking musical ground for the last 20 years, this shows no growth, it actually shows a certain boredom, as if the most she can muster is the melodies and a bit of work on the layering of the harmonies, no musical exploration, nada. For all the niceness of the melodies, musically, the album offers very little and says very little of where Enya's talent is. To the risk of crucifixion by fans, I would say that if this is the best you have to offer now, you should have stopped with the memory of trees and leave it at that. Now, don't hate me, it is my opinion after all, just that.<br /><br />PS- Enya, if you read this, please DO buy new instruments, hire a little string quartet, get a couple of gypsy players, anything but the pizzicato and the Yamaha sound piano, please! and find another rhythm to write in, you have already worn this one out, everything now sounds like only time.\\"<br />That's it.album offers very little and says very little of where Enya's talent is.

B001ED7C5I|4.0|Chapman's back with some folky themes. \\"So our bright future is in our past,\\" is the full lyric. In her 40's she's not quite as much of a fiery singer as she once was, but her voice is lovely as ever.    Of course, there's more.  Here are a few samples:     \\"Sing for you\\" is a dedication to her fans.      \\"Did it All\\" is a confessional of her life.     \\"For a Dream\\" talks about the reality versus the dreams of our lives.      \\"Save us All\\" has a gospel feel.  Tracy's talking about her God.  Seems the two of us feel the same.    The CD's listed as 'pop.'  I'd honestly consider it to be 'folk'.  It's a good addition to your Chapman CDs.  May not be the best introduction to her work.   This is a much softer Tracy than her initial offerings.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2008

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Let's face it, the late Heath Ledger is the real star of this movie, not Christian Bale.  The latter performs competently, though he also has a weird voice as Batman that made me want to offer him a cough drop or two.  Back to Ledger:  his accent never slips, he creates a character who had a brutal upbringing, he's diabolical and will stop at nothing, and he would prefer to keep Batman around just for the fun and the challenge.  He also smacks his lips a lot as a natural consequence of having had his mouth slashed--the salivary glands are out of control. Nice touch.  Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Aaron Eckhart are great in their smaller supporting rules, esp. Eckhart, with his anguished portrayal of Harvey Dent.  The action sequences are done expertly, especially the circus big rig and the armored vehicle chase.    There is definitely a very dark tone to this film, with Batman not being quite the hero that people want him to be, and many people turning against him as a vigilante who can't always be what they want him to be and can't always stop the evil in time.  He's a regular person, after all.
B000093BDX|5.0|Since I was growing up, I've always become quite influenced on the Beach Boys. I do believe that this album is a must have for any fan of the beach boys or a fine addition to any collection.    Although, I'll admit out that the music and the group is very good, however, there is one thing that I feel the need to point out. No, I'm not trying to defy or bash their music or the group for that matter. But, their music for the most part is basically written about girls, surfing, or cars. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing personal against the beach boys, and I believe that they have many good sounds. But, if you were a producer or a director (so to speak), and your group basically wrote songs about the same stuff mostly, would you express your thoughts on the matter? If so, How? Or if not, Why?    There's another point I wish to bring up. When I was searcing the beach boys on a wikipedia search because I was merely trying to get to know them. There was something that did catch my attention. I found out that they did a performance for the late president Reagan and former first lady Nancy Reagan back in the early 80's. Plus, I also found out that McCain listed a song or 2 of their stuff in his top 10 favorites songs. I was quite impressed.     For what it's worth, I'm glad I have the beach boys, and this album is one of 10 albums in my music collection. May their music be adored for generations to come. If you are trying to collect songs of the beach boys, then this album would be really helpful.     Finally, I must be honest here. I was going to rate this album 4 stars, but I decided to give it 5 after all. Why? Well, the music and sounds alone would of let me rated it 4 stars, but for their politican background on the right kind of persuaded me to give it an extra star.
B001GQACGE|1.0|Who is Beyonce trying to kid with music on this extremely embarrassing CD.  Even the two songs that are hits would be someone else's worst.  Stop it now while you are still ahead and give us something worth our time and worth your talent.  This music on this CD  is childish, boring, of the moment, repetitive, and just plain garbage.  If I Were A Boy, really, is that all the better we get?  And SIngle Ladies, that must have been recorded in what, 20 minutes.  The rest of this lame excuse for music isn't worth my time or yours to comment on or read.  I would be ashamed of myself if I put this crap out and so should Beyonce.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I resisted this sitcom at first because I thought it was just a \\"beauty and the geek\\" type comedy.  But after the writer's strike I watched the second part of the first season and felll in love with the characters.  Sheldon steals the show but my favorite character is tough, little Howard Wollowitz, who wears skinny pants with turtlenecks.    This show does play with a lot of stereotypes, but the writing is fresh and really funny in a clean, clever and benevolent way.  And the cast is superb with great chemistry.      Even with only one extra on the DVD set, I'm really happy with my purchase.  Hopefully, season 2 DVD will have more extras.
B001FBIPF0|4.0|FOB's last record, 2007's Infinity on High, took the band into uncharted power-pop territory (not to mention massive commercial success) while keeping bassist and main songwriter Pete Wentz's heart-on-sleeve, pun-heavy lyrics on full display. Folie &agrave; Deux, then, is the logical extension of the band's increasingly more grandiose aspirations. Fall Out Boy is tired of being the appointed kings of emo; they are more than ready to move on to the biggest arenas of the land, and Folie is just the kind of wildly overproduced, epically scattershot maelstrom of musical creativity in all its best and worst forms that will assuredly get them there.<br /><br />Calling in all the favors they've accumulated over their three and a half-odd years of stardom, Folie is fairly bursting with guest stars, from those you'd expect on a Fall Out Boy record (Panic vocalist Brendon Urie and Gym Class Heroes MC Travis McCoy are just two of the biggest) to those that leave you a bit stunned, such as bespectacled punk-pop godfather Elvis Costello on \\"What a Catch, Donnie\\" to New Wave sex symbol Debbie Harry on \\"West Coast Smoker\\" to Lil Wayne's work on \\"Tiffany Blews\\" (ok, maybe that last one isn't so special; after all, where hasn't Lil Wayne been this year?).<br /><br />But as usual with a FOB record, it's Wentz's sharp lyrics and singer Patrick Stump's over-emotive vocals that define Folie &agrave; Deux. On first single \\"I Don't Care,\\" over a walloping classic-rock riff reminiscent of Norman Greenbaum's `60s anthem \\"Spirit In The Sky,\\" Stump growls \\"I don't care what you think as long as it's about me\\" while sounding an awful lot like (seriously!) David Cook. Opener \\"Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes\\" sounds an awful lot like the opening to the Who's \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" but it's Wentz's sly jab at his critics within the lyrics (\\"imperfect boys with their perfect lives / nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy\\") that, as usual, make the song.<br /><br />Without a doubt, however, the biggest influence on the record is Cheap Trick-style `80s power pop, complete with orchestrated strings on \\"(Coffee's For Closers)\\" and Stump's best falsetto effort on songs such as the hilarious view on the music industry \\"The (Shipped) Gold Standard.\\" The hooky riff is still king in the world of Fall Out Boy, as are sing-a-long choruses and songs that rarely slow the tempo down. From the ridiculous `80s schizo synth rock of \\"Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet\\" (yes, Wentz is still in love with outsized song titles) to the funky pogo-beat on the excellently titled \\"20 Dollar Nose Bleed,\\" there are hooks aplenty throughout Folie. And fame has yet to jade the band's pun-tastic sense of humor, with Stump singing with dead seriousness lines like I don't know much about classic cars / but I got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke.\\" In fact, Stump's relentless dedication to give every song his note-stretching best and to sing as if a gun was pointed at his head at all times no matter the content is perhaps the most entertaining part of the record.<br /><br />Fall Out Boy's huge aspirations, however, don't always work out as they'd like them to. \\"What A Catch, Donnie,\\" a 5-minute piano R&B ballad that ends in the most bombastic, \\"Hey Jude\\"-esque ending, complete with Stump muttering a bit of \\"Hey Sugar, We're Going Down\\" at the end. It's ambitious, epic, and an utter mess from beginning to end. \\"w.a.m.s.\\" is an ill-advised foray into a bass-heavy dance number that comes off as a cheesy genre exercise. And Wentz is still writing lines that will keep that crown of emo firmly atop his head, including such gems as \\"a long walk to a dark house / roman candle heart keeps us far apart / I've got your body doing alright / hate me baby, maybe I'm a piece of art\\" on the not-so-romantic \\"Tiffany Blews.\\"<br /><br />In fact, besides the aforementioned \\"20 Dollar Nose Bleed\\" and the saving Debbie Harry spot on tossed-off closer \\"West Coast Smoker,\\" the second half of Folie is more tiresome than engaging, as the stacks and stacks of production and Stump's indefatigable vocals began to wear. Creative ideas are never bad, but FOB's seeming desire to put as much stuff in each song as musically possible practically begs for a better editor.<br /><br />Folie &agrave; Deux, is, without any shadow of a doubt, the most impressively inspired collection of music Fall Out Boy have put to record, and despite it's many flaws, it's a testament to their willingness to try to grow out of a genre that they were unfairly boxed into early in their career. Pete Wentz will never the most subtle songwriter or arranger, and the band's penchants for multi-layered vocal harmonies and dense song titles probably won't be going anywhere, and most of their fans won't mind a bit. It's always nice to see a band reach for the stars, even if they don't quite make it. Rock `n roll has always been about excess, and Fall Out Boy have learned that lesson well.acks of production and Stump's indefatigable vocals began to wear.

B0015XHP4K|5.0|My review will be divided by different groups of people, depending on \\"appearance\\":    For those people who watched those movies before in cinema, or on VHS, and who really liked those movies at that time (like me):    Recommendation: Buy it! Buy it for the movies themselves. They are worth to watch them again, because of sense of nostalgia, because of very strong character, social, emotional and psychological aspects shown in the movies, etc. Social problematic hasn't change a lot to this days since, so it's still actual. Despite the fact that the movies are 26, 23 and 20 years old, the action is still great (not sci-fictional and \\"cool\\" as shown today) but realistic.     about the quality of the picture and sound: only in Rambo 1 I've got the feeling in some background shots that the picture is a little bit over blurred for a high-def movie. But common the movies weren't shot recently, so in overall I will say the picture is very much enjoyable as well as the sound.    The only biggest minus which I found in Rambo 1-3 Boxset, is the absence of Rambo 4 :)  I would prefer to buy a Rambo 1-4 Boxset, the same way as it was done for blu-ray Die Hard Collection (1-4). Oh well, you can get Rambo 4 separately.    For those people who didn't watched those movies before at all, but likes action movies.  Most probably you were born in the time when the movies were shot or later.    If you liked the recent Rambo 4, I would recommend too buy and watch the previous 3 also (although in my opinion the 3rd is the weakest one). This will give you a more in depth understanding from where the character comes from, how he becomes himself, how he was abandoned by ordinary society or by \\"small bureaucracy kings\\" in charge, his internal struggle with himself, etc. and in any case this is Classic from action movie genre!    For those people who did see the movies before and didn't like them and/or who doesn't like action movies and/or has other reasons against this type of movies, or thestory, etc.    Don't buy it, unless you are interested to change your opinion to those types of movies or events shown in them, etc.

0375826726|2.0|Chris Lingel did a fantastic job reviewing this book and I am certainly not aspiring to trump that.  However, I do want to add some critiques of my own.  Disclaimer: of all the sins Paolini committed, verbose is one I understand best because, I obviously too. LoL!    The book is a true accomplishment for Paolini, so why do I only rate this book with a 2 star?  I rate it thus because while Paolini done an outstanding job as a 19-20 yrs old writing the third of this series (which should have been the last), I don't consider it worthy of a 4-5 stars work in Amazon's collection of books under this genre.  Like other reviewers said it similarly: great potential and creative for adolescent's work.  Paolini is an overachiever even for home-schoolers and for all the same reasons I want my son to be like him, besides the fact if I was his dad, I would be a quad-series millionaire, early retirement, lavish vacations, not worrying about bringing home the bread, etc etc.  Precisely so, it is the wrong reason to have any penmanship rated with permanent praise.  At best, it is the kind of work that promising authors write for testing the water and gauging his/her potential.  But if 3 books aren't enough to spend on this attempt, I don't what will in the brief time we do live in this world?    Aside from the incessant criticism of Paolini needing a better editor (as there is no need to revert to pseudo-Victorian style) because of his verbosity, the 'navel-gazing' sessions of his pro/antagonists riles my impatience to the nth degree.  I mean, how deep can you dig into your navel and ponder the zen of tree growth, space metals, PTSD, and dwarf politic. To psycho-analyze in Paolini's fashion, I have to say I am not sure whether the Victorian-like publishing company (Knopf) got the better of him or is it a reflection of his adolescent/puberty struggles.  And I have to sway to the latter because Paolini is essentially fantasizing himself in Eragon's persona.    Along the line, I oftenfind myself rolling my eyes and sighing - \\"here it goes again\\" when I couldn't flip the pages fast enough to skip paragraphs and pages of sweet-nothing exchanges between the himself (as the 'little one') and his invention - Saphira.  It makes me want to hurl after not pulling out fast enough from reading a few lines of the childish romance between a man and his pet flying lizard.  Because its sensuous nature, I think the book should be X-rated due to the pervert love between a man and his creature.  And to psycho-analyze in Paolini's fashion, because he is not yet married and fantasizes himself as Eragon, you might as well read Paolini's puberty and romantic struggle in his description of Eragon and Arya - failed or unblossomed teenager crush?  Uhmm, disturbing...    Lastly, Paolini prefers cat over dog, no good words about dogs but plenty of mystique surrounding the feline species (hint, hint - super good powerful beings: werecats, Maud, Solembum but where is a were-dog?).  As is obvious from the way he describes Saphira, Angela, Arya, Isalanzadi, Nasuada, Brigit, Katrina, and Trianna. These female characters behave catlike - jealous, protective, hen-like, quick to anger, assertive, and well - moody and aloof.  Which is what bothers me about how he protrays female in general - fierce, assertive, hen-like, but mysterious, and wiser than their male counterparts in general.  Aside from that stereo-type, the female characters are very flat and predictable.  Which of course, I learn to psycho-analyze in Paolini fashion - it is indicative of the dysfunctional views of the female races.  Is it due to his upbringing; I am not going that far, but if you are a girl and you want to attract Paolini, boss him around and 'assert' yourself. LoL! Because he might make you his Saphira in human form.  At least, that is a healthier relationship than one with a four legged creature.    I will read on, just because I have an unhealthy tendency to finish what I started.  Whether it is CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, JK Rowling, Tom Clancy, or Dorothy L. Sayers; I will finish what I started, sometimes against my own good.  My guess is that Paolini will actually write 5 for the series.  Why? (WARNING, I am going to let out a small spoiler here, so if you are not ready, skip the remainder of this paragraph) Because he obviously has to overcome Murtagh before the great G, and the great G hasn't even bothered to appear in person, and in the Victorian fashion Paolini writes, it sure doesn't 'pay' to write terse.  So, I gather, 1 book will be used to describe each of the dragons in his world, and there really are 5 dragons, albeit one hasn't hatched.  So that is my prediction.    Honestly, I hope I am wrong!  But at least I got the book from the library, so I didn't spend a dime for it.  Do I still want my son to become like him, dollars and cents wise - hell ya, write me 10 best sellers! I only charge 10% of sales for room and boards! Seriously, but I would give him a kick in the pants whenever he starts to dig into that navel of his, and I would also promptly fire his editor after whipping his you know what! ROFL!
0375826726|3.0|Well, my kudos to Chris Paolini for effort, certainly.  But I have to agree with many other reviews I have read on this book--nothing much happens in it!  I got to the end of this huge book (about 700 pages I think) and realized that everything that had happened probably should have happened in the first 100 pages.  It was a good read--but Paolini, there is something to be said for brevity.  Learn that, and you might have kept the reader's attention, and not had to write another book!
0137549202|5.0|This is just an amazing book. Seriously you can get a better deal for your hard earn money then this book .There good amount of examples and exercises to keep DSP fanatics entertained.<br />After reading this book I would highly recommend reading<br />\\"The Fast Fourier Transform and it Application by E.Oran Brigham\\"
B001KVZ6DE|4.0|As unfamiliar as I am with the music of 1950s artists like Muddy Waters, Etta James, Chuck Barry, and Howlin' Wolf, I was intrigued by \\"Cadillac Records,\\" a film that dramatizes their story along with that of Chicago's Chess Records. \\"Dramatizes\\" is, of course, a fancy term for \\"historically inaccurate.\\" Consider the fact that Chess Records was founded by brothers Leonard and Phil Chess; not only does the film depict Leonard as the sole founder, it doesn't even acknowledge that Phil existed. This isn't to say that the film doesn't get the job done; even if liberties were taken with history, it still manages to be both compelling and entertaining, telling the story of people who had little going for them other than their love of music. On one side, there are the black artists struggling to find success in a segregated world. On the other side, there are the white men--in this case, Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody)--who wanted to bring that black sound to the airwaves. Most of the time, such men could only rely on independently run radio stations known for playing race music, and even then, bribes were sometimes necessary.    The film begins by showing the humble beginnings of both Chess and Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright). The former was a down-on-his-luck club owner from Chicago while the latter was a plantation worker from Mississippi. After his goal of opening his own club literally goes up in flames, Chess becomes aware of Waters' music and essentially makes him a creative partner. They then begin visiting race music radio stations in the Deep South, Chess armed with a vinyl record and a bit of extra money to encourage the DJs. The airplay created a demand for blues music, which allowed Chess to start a new record label and open a studio in the middle of Chicago. As an extra incentive, Chess buys his musicians brand new Cadillacs; it's a nice gesture, although there is a definite sense of desperation in what he's doing, not helped by the fact that he often relies on royalties to make payments.    I can't say much about the real Leonard Chess, but the film version is such a fascinating character, able to recognize good music yet lacking a lot of financial and social know-how. His marriage to a young woman of Polish descent named Revetta (Emmanuelle Chriqui) is often troubled, mostly because a balance between business and family is never really maintained. There also comes a point when he meets Etta James (Beyoncé Knowles) and begins falling in love with her. She's also a fascinating character, and not just because of her incredible singing voice--assertive, opinionated, and bold, she's not someone to be messed with. Part of it comes from self-esteem issues, believing she's no better than her mother, a prostitute who had an affair with her father, Minnesota Fats. She often flirts with Chess, but she never quite lets him in, not until that pivotal moment when Chess says, \\"I'm not your father, and you're not your mother.\\"    The film also explores the relationship between Waters and his wife, Geneva Wade (Gabrielle Union), who tries her hardest to look past Waters' numerous extramarital affairs. Their story is intertwined with that of Little Walter (Columbus Short), who lives with Waters as they both sing exclusively for Chess. Walter, young and impetuous, soon stumbles his way into alcoholism, and while this made for good drama, his inner demons are never really examined. Granted, \\"Cadillac Records\\" is loaded with characters; if all of them were fully developed, the film would be hours long. Still, Walter deserved a bit more than he was given.    Minor subplots featuring Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and Chuck Berry (Mos Def) are effective, if a little condensed. Wolf, with his quiet, raspy voice and tremendous height (6'4\\"), is quite intimidating. He doesn't get along too well with Waters, who he feels is just one of Chess' business pawns. Unlike Waters, Wolf keeps his money well guarded, even going so far as to pay for the healthbenefits of his band. And as for Berry, who blended blues with country, he doesn't appreciate the fact that white musicians are getting all the credit for inventing rock `n' roll (incidentally, Mos Def has been just as vocal on the subject).    The film is narrated by Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer), the singer/songwriter known for \\"You Shook Me,\\" \\"I Ain't Superstitious,\\" and \\"Little Red Rooster.\\" Whether or not this was a necessary addition to the screenplay, I'm not sure; turning him into a storyteller is an interesting idea, yet he doesn't add all that much to the story besides some exposition. Still, Cedric the Entertainer is well cast, as is everyone else in this movie. Knowles is the most convincing as Etta James, an independent yet vulnerable woman. But as I said at the start of this review, this movie is more focused on music than it is on historical fact; my praise for Knowles is more of a testament to the skills of writer/director Darnell Martin than it is to the real Etta James. In spite of this, and in spite of the fact that my knowledge of 1950s music is limited, \\"Cadillac Records\\" is an engaging, entertaining movie.
1401309666|5.0|An excellent eye-opening book - highly recommended for the new business models that are changing the landscape for everyone. A must read.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I waited years for this to be released in an ultimate DVD set.  I pre-ordered it and was so thrilled when it arrived.  The packaging is great, and includes several limited edition postcards of stills from the show.  Also, the original and extended endings are offered for the pilot!  I had held off on ordering the first season when it was originally out because the version of the pilot was not the original version (I instead ordered a copy of the original pilot from SOUTH KOREA!).  It's so lovely to have everything in one gorgeous little box!! If you are a Twin Peaks fan, or a fan of David Lynch in general, as I am, definitely get this set!  What are you waiting for?!
B001HXG8PK|5.0|This is a great edition to add to your collection whether you're a Batman collector or you're a sound score purist.  The second disc includes the tracks that were in the movies so you can relive those moments from the Box Office smash.  The remixes from Paul Van Dyk, The Crystal Method and other well know artists are a big plus.  This is truly collector material.
0307383415|4.0|This was a very inspiring book.  It helps one see where are next president came from.
B001AIRUOU|1.0|The digital copy has so many restrictions on the installation that it makes it less than worthless.  I say less than worthless because you have to install Disney junk on your computer before you can do the ONE installation that the disc allows.<br />Don't fall for this rip off.  Get the version that has no digital copy and use a DVD ripper to make your own.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I like this edition because it came with the glasses and it looked more 3d and it was a very good movie...people got to get this edition
B001F12J3Y|3.0|I just bought this movie to play on my 50 in big screen.  The movie itself was great yet we were not able to watch the 3-d version because the quality was extremely poor.  I suggest you purchase the regular version if it is cheaper because the 3-d version is simply not watchable.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I purchased this CD just a week ago and have already listened to it a dozen times.  As my title indicates, this is the most memorable Christmas album I own, and I own at least 50.  If you're a long-time Loreena fan like me, you probably have this on your wish list already; here she offers the patented haunting, medieval Celtic-inspired McKennitt interpretation of some well-known European carols as well as some less-familiar ones.  I for one did not know \\"The Seven Joys of Mary\\" but learned that the Irish ballad \\"Star of the County Down\\" is based on this ancient melody.  Loreena's clear, thrilling soprano takes center stage, but she's also got some very interesting instrumental arrangements featuring her harp, accompanied by some Middle-Eastern inspired beats. If you are unfamiliar with this absolutely unique Canadian singer-songwriter-harpist, \\"A Midwinter's Dream\\" is an excellent introduction to the mystique of Loreena.  If you don't already own all her other CDs, this will inspire you to give them a listen.
031606792X|5.0|Having just finished the latest release in another series I was reading at the time and having a long flight the next day, I was grabbed by the cover art on Book 1... Twilight.  So, I perused the jacket notes and bought the book.  At first, as I started reading, I was a bit disappointed that it was a teen-agers story.  I was 42 at the time!  LOL But... I was trapped on a plane so, I kept reading.  Needless to say, since this review is for the final book... I was hooked!    To be honest, though I really enjoyed the book, I totally forgot that it was a continuing story until I again was drawn in by the cover art of Book 2.  When I looked closer, I recognized the author and was ecstatic to see that it was the next chapter in this love story.  Then... I remembered!  LOL  I was on the lookout for Book 3 and got it hot off the press!    Book 4 was absolutely everything that I could have hoped for in a Finale to the \\"telling\\" of the story of Edward and Bella.  Like it's predecessors, it is powerful in it's own right, but still intrinsically tied to them in feel and delivery and depth of the characters.  It brings us closer to those previously on the fringe of the story so that we can get closer to them, better understand them, but not be left wanting more from them.  It brings new characters into play so that in the ending of the story \\"telling\\", we are left with a far bigger world for our Edward and Bella to live in than just Forks.    If you are like me, and dread how a writer will end a story, then you will love \\"Breaking Dawn\\".  I keep using the word \\"telling\\" because although it is clear that the written accounts of the Cullen's has ended, it is undoubtedly clear that the story of the Cullen's will continue...  eternally.    If you have read the previous books... then I have really wasted a review because there is no doubt in my mind that even if I or anyone else were to say that Book 4 sucked... you'd buy it anyway!  LOL  I know surely would have.    No, this reviewis really for those who have not read them... or perhaps, read the first but decided not to jump on the Twilight Train.  If you don't want to invest in it, go to the library and start from the beginning.  I cannot imagine not owning this set so that I can go back and revisit and find new things to love about it.  I think you will feel the same.    ~Enjoy!
0618154248|4.0|This set is nice as a gift, four for the price of one.  The books are smaller in size than the normal Curious George books but they are done nicely.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|The most action-packed Bond film to date. Daniel Craig is superb. And as for the blue-ray edition of \\"Casino Royale\\", well, this is the definitive blue-ray film. If you need a reason to go blue-ray, just watch \\"Casino Royale\\" in blue-ray. It speaks for itself.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|I was damn suprised by this...a GREAT cd with consistenly good tunes, along with some classic-sounding tracks.  There are about three or four songs on here that could easily been on Back in Black.  Do not be fooled by the Walmart stuff - this is a GREAT cd!  Best work since The Razor's Edge!!!

B001GKJ2DO|1.0|This movie was horrible, the acting was just downright cheesy! If it hadn't been for my grandma wanting to see this, I would have never thought twice about it. Infact, just seeing the preview, I said to my boyfriend \\"I Never Want to see that!\\" Well, I guess I jinxed myself! But, it really didn't do anything for me!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Nickleback has got to be one of my all-time favorite bands. This album is awesome. The beat and lyrics are undeniably classic Nickleback.

B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Wanted, starring Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp is an action packed film with some scenes that left us spell bound, especially when Jolie drives.    The hero is a guy that lacks self-confidence and feels that he matters to no one, so when he is selected and trained by a strange group, he resists and questions the purpose, but learns and adapts rather fast to a total change of life style.    Wesley Gibson, played by James McAvoy is an accountant at a dead end job, where his boss is a female tyrant that loves to belittle her staff, demanding performance or else.    Everyone takes advantage of him, starting with his best friend who is having an affair with his girlfriend, to his boss who yells at him while making her stapler snap to drive him mad.    The first scenes bring Angelina Jolie, playing the part of an amazingly talented member of a group, \\"The Fraternity,\\" who kill those that are surfaced by clues derived from the needle point of fabric. Yes, it sounds far-fetched, but the action and the plot are simply best-in-class.    Cross, a sharp-shooter is after Wesley Gibson and Angelina Jolie saves him, preventing his death. At the beginning of the movie, a man gets killed and Jolie reveals to Gibson that this was his father and that now he must learn the trade to eliminate Cross.    Gibson is moved to the training facility for the Fraternity, where he meets other members as each teaches him a new set of skills, we simply loved the knife sequence. There is great damage done to his body as he trains, but they are submerged into a substance that repairs wounds and bruises at the speed of light. Through this daily routine, Wesley Gibson transforms into a mean... lean... killing machine!    The leader of the fraternity is Sloan, played with the superb style of Morgan Freeman and as the plot develops we learn the danger of great power and how it can corrupt those who possess absolute power.    The climax is unforgettable, we were not expecting it, and the action is so amazing that rarely were we able to stop the excitement experienced while watching this amazing film. Don't miss it!!!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I love it.  It's the perfect gift for my little boy.  I believe he will love it.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This is a cute film that depicts the stereotypical south.  Being from the south, I found it charming and funny!
B001EO748M|5.0|Blessings to the cast of The Tudors, and those who work behind the scenes, this is an amazing adaptation of Henry VIII, I highly recommend.... so happy to watch it!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This CD is wonderful   I'll enjoy listening to it for years to come.
B000060OWV|5.0|Robben Ford can really play the guitar and his smooth voice make listening to these songs a pleasure. Love his music. I have several of his CD's which are hard to get in a store so Amazon is the place to shop.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Advent Children is simple a piece of art.<br />I love how the staff of this videogame keeps on taking new stuff and ideas of a futuristic setting and of their unique lovable characters.<br />A MUST have for Final Fantasy fans, either videogames, anime or manga.<br />I want more of this kind of stuff and of this same high quality!
B000UNYJV8|3.0|This is England came to me highly recommended as a smart, insightful film that told a story of modern history that I agree is worth telling. The problem is, I am left clueless as to what this movie was about. It didn't quite work as political commentary, as history, as a coming of age tale, as a story of the aftermath of grieving and loss, or as a buddy film. Its gaping ramblings about skinhead culture, race relations and changing times during Thatcher's \\"reign\\" needed more focus and a better script. I think too much was ambitiously aimed at by the makers of This is England, and as a result, what could have been an entertaining tale with a sound message ended up being a scattered, drifting, inexplicably stuttering exercise in missed opportunity. What was worth sticking around for were the performances here by some talented actors, young Thomas Turgoose as the emotionally needy central character, and the charismatic Stephan Graham most of all. Graham's sympathetic lost soul skinhead character, Combo, was in equal parts endearing, repulsive, and fascinating, and if this movie had a saving grace it was to be found in him. Other characters were maddeningly underused, namely Joseph Gilgun's Woody, who seemed poised to be the film's protagonist, but vanished as the plot grew toward its mid-point. This is England is in part inspired by real people and events in its director, Shane Meadow's, life, and I'm sure had much personal meaning to him, but it was still a sadly empty motion picture that did not live up to its billing.
B000GFLEJA|1.0|When I received the video, it did not play.  We returned the item and received a new one promptly.  The second video was also no good.  It did not play.  We returned the item again.  Eventually we received a full refund for the entire order but I was disappointed that the DVD did not play on two different occasions.  The customer service regarding the returns was wonderful.
B001DUJNGS|3.0|When Enigma first released their first album, I was one of the few who couldn't stand it.  But then, my only exposure to their sound was \\"Sadeness,\\" a piece I still don't care for.    It was only this past year that I happened to hear a track from their second album, \\"Return to Innocence,\\" and was blown away.  I immediately picked up all six of their studio albums and couldn't believe I'd missed out on all this fabulous stuff over the years.    I eagerly snatched up SEVEN LIVES upon its release and... yeah.  Disappointed.  The thing this album lacks is the presence of powerhouse tracks like the aforementioned \\"Return to Innocence,\\" \\"The Child in Us,\\" \\"Gravity of Love,\\" and so on.  While there are some pleasant pieces, here, it's just unimpressive, by Enigma standards.    I will not go so far, as others have, to say \\"save your money.\\"  I don't regret buying it.  But it's never going to be among my favorites.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is the first CD I can actually say I probably overplayed.  I haven't listened to it in a long time, but I studied for many a college test while listening to this.  I'm ordering the CD again b/c the first one broke.  It actually still plays, it just get stuck at a certain pt.  I don't think it was a problem with the disc itself, probably just played it too many times.<br /><br />Beautiful score, great for relaxing or studying or whatever.  Definitely something I would recommend if you like soundtracks.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Great music to \\"get in the spirit\\" of Christmas. The pleasant, relaxing voice of James Taylor singing everyone's favorite holiday songs, in his own great style. *****CD
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Another beautiful selection of music from a fine movie.  It might be something nice to play while you're reading or working on homework.  There's something utterly relaxing about listening to a good soundtrack.  I've found it a nice way to mark time when I'm working at home.  Surprisingly, it can also help you study.  I'm no official expert on that, but it personally worked for me.<br /><br />In any case, a worthy investment.

B00161ISR4|5.0|In 1955 a number of great films premiered in theaters across the country- Bad Day at Black Rock, The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell, East of Eden, The Far Country, Mister Roberts, The Seven Year Itch,  Lady and the Tramp, and many others. Marty would take best picture.     There were a number of science-fiction films.  One of these was Tarantula.     This film has an assortment of fine characters with a good script and decent special effects for the time period.    Once again the viewer is given a glimpse into the mysterious world of the atom, especially the radiation component which has tragic consequences for the human race.    A group of scientists from Oak Ridge relocate to a quiet, desert town of Desert Rock, Arizona.  Outside of the city limits, they conduct their secret experiments on a non organic nutrient food concentrate.  Their goal is lofty-to alleviate world hunger as the population increases beyond the earth's abilities to provide food.     There is a tragic accident, and an injected tarantula escapes from the lab.  The nutrient accelerates the growth rate at an astronomical rate.  The spider becomes the menace, but the real villains are the scientists who created it by altering nature's laws.     Leo G. Caroll was the dedicated Gerald Deemer from Oak Ridge who led the team.  His soft spoken manner gave his character a sympathetic allure, rationality, sanity, and humanity.     John Agar's portrayal of Matt Hastings, the country doctor who attempts to solve the mystery of a man's strange death, is played with deftness. His gentle nature and calmness are attributes of a small town healer and comforter.    Stephanie \\"Steve\\" Clayton, the graduate biology student, is both beautiful and intelligent.  She can also cook, clean and wash- the ideal woman of the 50's.    There is a nice chemistry between her and Hastings.  A little romantic tension goes a long way in this film.    Hank Patterson's Josh is a delight.  He's the comic relief.  He has some of the best scenes and lines.    Some of the dialogue is priceless- \\"Jumping Jupiter\\"; \\"Holy Cow\\"; etc.  You don't find this five and dime dialogue in today's film market.    The cameo of Clint Eastwood as a fighter pilot is a good piece of cinema history.  The oxygen mask may have covered his face, but those eyes of his acted brilliantly.        Also, it was an unaccredited, young composer named Henry Mancini who did the music. He was under contract to Universal Pictures Music Department.    The climatic ending is a fine moment caught in time.  When you view this film and especially its ending, image yourself in the audience of 1955.  The ending takes on a whole new meaning when viewed from that 1955 perspective.    For this 1950's science fiction genre, this is one of the well written and acted films which tapped into the fears of society about the atom and its deadly components.  Ordinary people facing extraordinary menaces, is life at its most challenging moments.
B0000214F0|2.0|I am a true history buff.  After watching the story of Caligula on the History Channel, I decided to buy the movie.  I was truly disappointed.  The story line was weak and riddled with strong vulgar sex scenes that were unnecessary as to WHO or WHAT Caligula was or was about.  Although Caligula was sexually perverted, the movie never went into great detail as to WHY he was that way.  If it had explained the young Caligula in greater depth instead of concentrating on his sexual deviances, then maybe the movie would have made more sense as to why he was he was weird.   Therefore, this was just another senseless porno that was based on a true story.
1600243916|5.0|Many have been critical of this book for its research and like of scientific prowess. Gladwell is a writer- he has no (and claims no) academic premise in his books. I listened to this book which Gladwell narrates- and his voice is so compelling. Worst case, this is a fascinating subject and concept that is worth anyone's time.

B0018CWEZ8|3.0|Watched seasons 1-3 on DVD on my Xbox 360... Which I know upconverts to 1080p and uses smoothing technology... Even standard DVDs look better on the 360 than on my PS3.<br /><br />That's not my issue though. I'm wondering why Lost Season 4 looks so meh. There's a lot of noise in the picture, especially on dark objects on the screen... Like on a black jacket or shadows for example. I never noticed this on the previous seasons... And I don't think it's just the PS3 doing a poor job. On the preview-promo trailer at the beginning of the disk I don't see any of those problems, which leads me to believe it may be the transfer.<br /><br />But looking at reviews for Lost S4 on Blu-ray, everyone gives it great reviews. I don't know if I'm being picky, or if there's a problem with the discs, my ps3 codec, or ...???<br /><br />I'm getting occasional stuck pixels popping up. It seems to be in the same place every time they pop in, but they often pop back out too. They are whitish green when they are stuck, and one is brighter than the other.<br /><br />I figured out the stuck pixel issue. It's directly related to subtitles. I noticed when the there were no subtitles on the screen, the pixels would appear in a location totally different from where the subtitles were... Which makes it look like it's not related. But then when a subtitle popped back up, it dissappeared. I turned off subtitles and confirmed. Turned subtitles on,a nd then the pixels appeared when the subtitles appeared, opposite of when they would appear before, but the same brightness, contrast, and location. Weird.<br /><br />So while the season is pretty solid so far (about halfway through), the poor video/production quality, even compared to DVD, is extremely aggrevating.

B001C08RHA|4.0|I must say that when I was growing up I did not read comic books.  I am still unsure if the Ironman movie is based on some Ironman comic book or not, but if it is, it really does not matter.  This is why.  The cast in this film:  Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges (who you will barely recognise), Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are amazing.  In the first 20 minutes I almost thought \\"where can this film possibly go from here?\\", but then the plot was so well thought out that you will want to see what are all these amazing characters up to.  Robert Downey Jr. plays the Ironman, a gifted scientist who inherits his father's weapons making corporation only to learn that it is time to grow up and take a responsibility for the damage that weapons can do not just to the rest of the world but also to the americans themselves.  He is indulgent, overconfident, rich but stilll likable.  A kind of a bad boy only Downey Jr. can profile.  Several comic parts are so memorable because Downey Jr. is such a gifted actor that no matter how much bad press he can get about his personal conduct in his personal life we still love him, adore his talent and those dark piercing eyes of his.  I actuallly really like this action movie where the main character does not have to be another muscle but can charm us with his sense of humor, genuine smartness and charisma.  Robert Downey Jr. is all of that.  Enjoy! Oh, and if there is another Ironman movie coming out, I will want to be the first one to see it.

B00007AJGH|5.0|I have very fond memories of sneaking downstairs late at night as a young child and snuggling up with my big sisters on the couch to watch `Who Framed Roger Rabbit'.  I was merely five or so at the time, but I can still remember it quite vividly.  Each and every time I watch this wonderful movie I get that same sense of calming comfort that I had resting in their arms.<br /><br />That's what movies are all about, right?<br /><br />`Who Framed Roger Rabbit' was a total breakthrough at the time it was released, and it serves today as the foundation for the perfect family feature.  The combination of live action and animation has been achieved since, and even before, but in my opinion it has never been achieved with this same sense of perfection.<br /><br />`Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is unlike any movie you've ever seen.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Eddie Valiant, a detective who abhors toons after one killed his brother.  He used to be a defender of the toons, now he despises them.  He's hired to follow around Jessica Rabbit, the wife of toon star Roger Rabbit.  He uncovers a secret that may or may not have led Roger to kill a man.  Roger of course claims innocence and pleads with Eddie to help him clear his name.  Hiding from the sinister Judge Doom, Eddie and Roger embark on a perilous adventure to uncover the truth behind this grisly crime.<br /><br />I adore Hoskins.  He's just such a naturally charming acting, his gruff exterior included.  He fits into this role so wonderfully, giving the right amount of feeling to his character in order to make him real and not a walking caricature.  This could have been nothing more than a campy film, but it isn't campy at all.  Christopher Lloyd is his usual zany self, and he fits the role beautifully.  The voice work done (mostly by Charles Fleischer) is also spot on perfect.<br /><br />`Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is the definition of a movie experience.  It is smartly written film and it is masterfully directed by Robert Zemeckis who balances the dark live action underworld with the crisp animated world brilliantly.  This film is deliciousness to the eyes, most definitely, but it never substitutes glamour for brains.  The film never once insults our intelligence.<br /><br />If you are looking for a film that will entertain you to the core, this is it.on underworld with the crisp animated world brilliantly.

B00006D295|5.0|To say that there is no other film out there quite like `The Rocky Horror Picture Show' is definitely putting it mildly.  There is a local theater near me that plays this movie every Sunday night and I finally brought myself to go down there and see it.  I'm telling you, the experience of seeing it at midnight with a bunch of...well...anyways, it was almost as big an experience as the movie itself, but this is not a review of the time I had, but the film so I will refrain from anymore details.<br /><br />The film is a total head-trip, but in a good way; a great way even.  Janet Weiss and her boyfriend Brad Majors are stranded and need some help so they stumble onto a mansion that looks promising, but instead they are introduced to a slew of creepy creatures from the Transylvanian galaxy that show that a romping good time filled with singing, dancing and some naughty after party action.<br /><br />Like I said; head-trip.<br /><br />I really don't know what else there is to say about this movie because it's less a movie and more an experience.  Sure it has a campy sci-fi plot and it executes it well (complete with monster creations and alien banishment) but that is not the point.<br /><br />You have to experience it to believe it; seriously.<br /><br />The acting is flawless throughout, especially from the two leads; Curry and Sarandon.  Susan Sarandon, one of our most capable actresses working today, or ever, is amazing here.  This is one of her earliest roles.  She's young and stunning and commanding in every scene; and what a voice.  Tim Curry tackles what may be considered one of the most fearless roles in the history of cinema as Dr. Frank-N-Furter.  There is no hesitation in his step for he is fully confident and comfortable in his platform shoes.  Without that confidence this performance and this film would have tanked, big time, but Curry carries it on his shoulders flawlessly.<br /><br />Why can't Oscar recognize greatness like this?<br /><br />In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is not a film for everyone, but it is a film that everyone should experience at least once.  There is nothing else out that even comes remotely close to this film, in subject and in execution.  These are those rarities that will never be repeated.  Indulge, guiltily, in what has to be the worlds most famous guilty pleasure.ighly recommend this film.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|This film feels off when you compare it to the other films given to us by Spike Lee.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing (we all know that I am not the biggest Spike Lee fan) but the fact that it doesn't truly feel like a Spike Lee film is significant.  Sure, Lee inserts his views on race relations when he has the chance (please get off it for once) but the brisk pace and overall plot development feel like something far removed from director Spike Lee.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing to the viewer is entirely up to that individual.<br /><br />Personally I found the pacing a welcomed change.  It was easier to follow and more engaging than some of Lee's more preachy endeavors, and while it lacks the depth and pristine command that Lee exhibited in `25th Hour' it manages to keep my interest throughout.<br /><br />I was entertained.<br /><br />At the films open we are introduced to Dalton Russell.  Pay close attention for he chooses his words carefully.  He basically tells you all the films secrets in the opening scene, but you won't get it, at least not yet.  He is going to rob a bank.  Next thing you know the bank is sealed and Dalton and his accomplices take everyone hostage, making them don jumpsuits and stripping them of their cell phones and keys.  Outside the bank Detective Keith Frazier (in search of a promotion) takes on the task of negotiating the safety of the hostages with Dalton, but there is no outsmarting that man who has no doubt thought this through.<br /><br />Sadly, it feels at times like the screenwriter didn't do the same.  There are plot holes that stick out like sore thumbs, especially as the plot twists start revealing themselves.  The side plot involving Arthur Case (the bank owner) and the `fixer' he hires is a tad convoluted and needed a little tweaking.  Parts of the execution regarding Dalton's escape are also a bit of a stretch, but it's nothing that takes away from the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Just don't think about it too hard.<br /><br />The performances are a delight here though.  Clive Owen is a very effective actor who has consistently presented himself wonderfully on screen.  He's able to engage the audience from the moment he opens his mouth (that voice) but he also has the ability to sustain our attention with the light in his eyes.  Denzel Washington was a nice surprise here as well.  He was able to keep his charm controlled as apposed to allowing it to run wild as he often does.  This is probably one of his better performances, for he found the proper balance in his style of acting.  Christopher Plummer does what he can with his character, and he does it very well; but he is upstaged (as is everyone) by Jodie Foster.  Seriously, what in the world has she been doing?  Where was this amazing and commanding force back when she was winning Oscars for performances that were beneath her obviously?  I mean what she does here is leagues ahead of a lot of her more acclaimed performances.<br /><br />LOVED IT!!!<br /><br />In the end `Inside Man' is a very interesting and enjoyable heist film.  It is not as smart as it appears to be, nor as intelligent as it wants to be, but it is as fun as it claims to be so check it out.  The performances and the quick paced action will keep you glued even if the films preposterousness wages war on you later on.

B000P0J0AG|4.0|`Heat' is lauded as one of the greatest crime epics ever; a triumph of acting, directing and screen writing.  I personally wasn't able to see this film for the longest time.  I guess I shouldn't say `wasn't able'; I just never got around to it.  Finally, after all the poking and prodding from friends, I sat down to digest this supposed masterpiece and was able to draw my own conclusions on the matter.<br /><br />Very, very good.<br /><br />Notice I didn't say masterpiece; but it is very close.  I have a few issues with the film, mostly due to some aspects of the script and one particular performance, but for the most part `Heat' is extremely well done.  Michael Mann is probably one of our greatest working directors and this is his Mona Lisa.  He graciously allows the camera to flow through each scene, collecting important details that not only map out the visual feast of bullets and bodies, but he is delicate enough to allow us to come to know the characters intimately, painting a portrait of reality instead of a collage of carnage.  Sure, the films most notable sequence is one of bloodshed (the whole daylight shootout is spectacularly shot) but Mann is equally invested in the homelife of his anti-heroes which only adds layers to the films core.<br /><br />`Heat' tells the story of master thief Neil McCauley.  Neil is on the verge of retirement, but before he slips away he wants to make one more heist.  Lt. Vincent Hanna is desperately trying to nail him.  The film is basically a game of cat and mouse between thief and cop as they track each other.  Mann makes sure to get deep into the heart of both characters, as well as their partners; especially McCauley's right hand man Chris Shiherlis who is having marital problems of his own.<br /><br />My one issue with the script comes in the form of Eady, the love interest of Neil.  I personally found her character arc forced a tad.  It felt out of place even though it served as a major plot point in the films finale.  It just felt unnecessary to me.<br /><br />For the most part the acting is superb here.  De Niro was still making worthwhile films and delivering within them, so his portrayal of McCauley is the films major highlight.  He gives Neil a stark humanity that makes him someone we can relate to and feel for.  Val Kilmer does some impressive work (he had such promise) here as Chris, but his scenes are stolen from him by Ashley Judd who is more than phenomenal as his conflicted wife Charlene.  Tom Sizemore is always dependable in these type roles, and Diane Verona is flawless as Vincent's bitter wife Justine.  That brings me to Pacino.  Why does he feel like he has to scream about everything?  I mean really, he used to be one of the greatest actors of all time and then it was like all of a sudden he decided that he didn't have to try anymore.  He's more than annoying; he's frustrating.  There are glimmers here of his natural charm, but he muddles it up by trying to be `larger than life' and he just winds up being `beyond annoying'.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just picking, but whatever.<br /><br />Overall the film is a very, very good one; a great one at that.  I highly recommend it for the few faults are easily looked over for the many highlights.  Michael Mann has crafted a smart and engaging crime epic that is as beautiful as it is enjoyable to watch.ust felt unnecessary to me.<br /><br />For the most part the acting is superb here.

B00005J6UR|5.0|Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante, and Chris Columbus collaborated on this modern Christmas classic.  \\"Gremlins\\" is a mild horror film set in a small town that is easily a stand-in for Bedford Falls from \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\"  Leave it to these three guys to inject a lot of subversive, sarcastic humor, using the vile Gremlins as their horror-comic tool.    The plot is well-known - a wacky inventor brings home the \\"perfect Christmas present\\" from a mysterious Chinese shop - a Mogwai. The Mogwai, Gizmo, is beyond cute (particularly thanks to the voice work of Howie Mandel).  But Giz has flaws - namely 3:  He hates bright light, he can't get wet, and you can never, ever feed him after midnight.    Of course, these rules get broken throughout the film, with terrific results.  The Gremlins overrun the town, causing hilarious, murderous mayhem along the way.  It's up to Zach Gilligan and Phoebe Cates as the stereotypically-nice guy and gal to save the day.      The plot is simple - the joy is in its execution.  This is one of the best Christmas movies to come out in recent years and is a wonderful antidote to all the holiday movies that focus solely on existential angst or rampant commercialism, although there is just enough anti-commercialism message in this flick to make it worthwhile.      To be fair, \\"Gremlins\\" is light-hearted stuff, but can be a little scary if you're kids are young (say, 6 or so, older kids should do just fine).  A couple of humans and a gazillion Gremlins meet their makers in unpleasant ways, and the Gremlins are pretty scary up close.  The kids will quickly adopt Gizmo as a favorite, but there are quite a few dark moments - and you'll never look at a microwave the same way again.

John Steinbeck is without a doubt a superb storyteller. \\"East of Eden\\" has many facets and dimensions within it. Somehow or another Steinbeck is able to write a multi-dimensional story with phenomenal characters and keep the entire novel cohesive from start to finish.    I had a difficult to wanting to do anything but read this novel once I started reading it. The writing is fantastic and entertaining... The characters are fabulous and there was always so much going on in this novel that you eagerly want to find out what is going to happen next!    This is a must read novel. Steinbeck is such a wonderful writer that I can see why he won the Nobel Prize for Literature!

B000OCXFCO|3.0|United Abominations is a bit of a mixed bag.  Dave Mustaine has never been one to shy away from politics or expressing his opinions in general, and here we see him boiling over based on the events of the early twenty-first century.  However, it is the non-lyrical balance of the CD that is kind of spotty.  If you were hoping to finally have a return to Rust In Piece, United Abominations doesn't quite get there.<br /><br />Lyrically, it is not a reach to say that United Abominations lands on the extreme side.  I am usually one to err on the side of artistic expression, but I find Mustaine's commits many of the very things that he sings against.  In \\"Amerikhastan\\", he makes reference to there being \\"no more Middle East\\" and warns \\"Jihad Joe\\" that \\"we're coming to get you!\\".  It may seem subtle to some, but there is a difference between supporting a just war and an unbridled, bloodthirsty call for revenge.  Contrasted against this is the much saner calling to account of the UN on \\"United Abominations\\".  Here Mustaine takes much more of an informing role on the failings of the UN over the last thirty years.  Finally, Mustaine can still take an obtuse approach to crafting a song as he does in \\"Washington Is Next\\" where he relates Washington as the conquest of the Antichrist, i.e. \\"The Eighth False King\\".  I have to give him credit for writing thought provoking material.  There aren't enough artists for which it can be said that they make you think.<br /><br />While Mustaine's songwriting is as strong as always, the instrumentation on United Abominations is all over the place.  Things start out very promising on \\"Sleepwalker\\" with a gradual build up to a crunching rhythm guitar line that really paces the song.  On \\"Washington Is Next\\", Mustaine gives a solid guitar into that sets the stage for another high energy number.  So two songs in I was thinking that we were in for a return to form.  \\"Never Walk Alone...A Call To Arms\\" makes a bit of a transition.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but it doesn't have the same intensity as the openers.  The remainder of the songs wanders rather aimlessly into the more watered down sounds of the post Rust In Peace era.  They aren't necessarily bad in of themselves, but they just seem flat in the context of Megadeth's earlier recordings.  Whether or not you will like these songs depends on what you are looking for.  If you are looking for classic Megadeth, you will be disappointed.  If you are a new listener or someone who has liked Megadeth's full body of work, you have a better chance of enjoying United Abominations.<br /><br />All in all, United Abominations is a CD to go into with you eyes open.  I would not recommend it for anyone impressionable who would be influenced by the lyrics without giving them much thought.

Apart from well-known pompous judges (we have their names) and even more pompous civil servants employed in the court service (when they are not on strike), lawyers have a reputation for bad writing when traditional legal writing becomes a bad habit and requires simple modernisation.<br /><br />I suggest you read 'Adler on Clarity', starting at the beginning when Mr Adler writes that \\"this book is intended to give lawyers a better life\\". It does just that! The book succeeds in doing so brilliantly, and in a friendly manner. Adler has drawn from highly authoritative sources to make his point, including comments from the late Professor John Adams, acknowledging a list of distinguished personal contributors, and Lord Bingham's acute observation that \\"you cannot write clearly unless you know clearly what it is you want to say\\".<br /><br />There are five sections to the book:<br /><br />- What's wrong with legal writing?<br />- Alternative ways to communicate<br />- How to make legal writing more effective<br />- The common law rules of interpretation<br />- A plain language workshop<br /><br />Each section builds up to provide a detailed guide to effective legal writing with a robust indictment of traditional legal language.  The key is plain language which provides successful communication with clients, colleagues and the world in general. It is plain language and not pomposity which prevents ambiguity and mistakes to save your firm time and money as well as expressing a message effectively and in an approachable manner.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the sections on emails and websites which no doubt will expand with the third edition as these new methods of communication transform our lives.  I see 'Clarity for Lawyers' as a publication to be recommended in publications such as \\"Which\\" magazine, and its organisation, the Consumers' Association, plus all the consumer groups trying to establish modern rules of writing \\"fit for purpose\\" (an unfortunate phrase) in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />Probably the greatest benefit to lawyers are the working examples throughout showing how legalese can be rewritten into plain English.  The examples are taken from Adler's extensive experience in practice, and in teaching (and clearly gained from his Cert Ed training which is an 'eye opener' to many) linked with the activities given in the plain language workshop, and the conclusion with the exercises and precedents. From what I have seen of this book, and it needs to be read over with care, it is highly suitable for the Bar course as well and has relevance to a much wider audience for its reader-friendly style.  All interviewees should read it, too.<br /><br />I was re-reading 'The Adventure of English' by Melvyn Bragg which examines the position of English today as a truly global language, and I realised how the English language has moved on as changes in communication approaches take place.  Just reading the old law reports illustrate such changes and Adler's attack on `inflated' language is well placed here.  I liked the conclusion in his preface when he refers to the `robust attitude from the trial bench' (we have all suffered that) which he hopes will `soon force the offenders to abandon their affectations'. The point is rightly asserted that clients will take their work elsewhere if their solicitor refuses to write plainly.<br /><br />Some of the most successful professional writers are copywriters, and this book is also directly relevant to them as the `Crystal Mark' has now become the accepted benchmark for plain writing.  If the reader does not look at any other chapter, please read chapter 20 on `choosing words'.  It is always the dream of examiners, with their itchy red pens, to delete, prune or `trim' what isn't necessary when marking a paper- Adler shows us what to do to erase the gobbledegook, and he gets full marks for it.<br /><br />Thank you for an excellent contribution to the study of twenty-first century English language, and let's make this work a set book for all students in the future.to the study of twenty-first century English language, and let's make this work a set book for all students in the future.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|What's not to like. One of the finest shows ever produced. I had already seen season two and watching season one made the character's personalities so much clearer. I cannot believe how well the producers captured the 60s, not only the attitudes, but the style of the times. Must see this.
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|I love movie musicals. This is one of the worst movies (of any kind) I have ever seen. Watching and listening to Pierce Brosnan in this movie is painful.  Rent before you waste your money on this one.
159448385X|5.0|We think we know or have a general idea what goes on with the lives of individuals in Afghanistan, but we are extremely naive! This book was one of the best I have read. It was filled with little happiness, yet a lot of love and compassion between these two women. I found myself living among them and was easily absorbed by their fears, agony and treatment by men who treated them as cattle or a farm animal. This is a fantastic read for anyone who waited to read it. I thought The Kite Runner was great, but this one is even better. Kudos to Khaled Hosseini as I was totally taken with this book, and I do read daily. Suggest you do not wait to grab this book at your earliest opportunity!

B0017APPSO|4.0|Winning the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2007 and even getting a surprising Oscar nod in the Best Animated Feature category, PERSEPOLIS is more of a dramatic biography of one girl's life as she runs away from her country and her Iranian heritage.<br /><br />Most Americans are probably used to animated films being light, funny, or a combination of the two (thinking along the lines of [[ASIN:B0015HS5S6 Finding Nemo]]). But Persepolis isn't even in the same ballpark.<br /><br />The animation is cruder, with thick, black lines indicating the strict black and white laws of Iran during the Islamic Revolution that rocked the nation. No 3-dimensions here either. But the austere coloring and 2-dimensional representations are an integral part of the story.<br /><br />The story follows the real-life history of its creator, Marjane Satrapi, who grew up during Iran's tumult and the battles incurred while trying to find its identity. Marjane, too, tries to find herself, and often latches onto the world around her, until family and friends teach her the horrors of past, present, and probably future.<br /><br />The audience grows up with Marjane, learning the ways of the outside world while watching Iran implode. Alone and lost in a world that doesn't understand her, Marjane must learn to live her life while worrying about what's happening back home (she leaves Iran at the behest of her parents and travels around Europe, going to school and working odd jobs).<br /><br />The gripping story is told all from Marjanes point of view, making the viewer care tremendously about this young girl as she creeps into womanhood. We feel her aches and pains as she tries to understand the world around her but keeps getting stymied by her upbringing and her terrible losses back in Iran.<br /><br />I do have to warn potential viewers, though, that this animation holds back nothing. The language, the wars, sex, drugs, it's all there, and Marjane experiences all of them in their great and terribleness. That being said, this is a breath of fresh air in terms of what most audiences think of as an animated feature. It'll surprise you again and again.in terms of what most audiences think of as an animated feature. It'll surprise you again and again.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|After three years, the darkness returns with a splash.  It is even darker than ever.  This movie doesn't bring any disappointment.  It is a truly memorable movie in all.  For the story, it is very good with loads of excitement like how the Joker will make Gotham City in a total mess and destroy the romance relationship between Harvey and Rachel.  For the acting, Christian Bale once again proves himself that he can be suitable to play the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne.  For Heath Ledger as the Joker, he plays good too.  For the direction, it is good.  For the visuals, it is absolutely perfect with no doubts.  Compare with the other movies, this is the best among all Batman series.
0061438294|5.0|This was the first book of its kind that I read and loved it.  It was very descriptive with lots of good pictures. I learned so much from this book and felt it was written by a very experienced person.  Great book
B001AHM2C6|5.0|This CD is a very tremendous one.  It has a dark feeling once more after 3 years.  But, this is even containing darker feeling for me.  In this soundtrack, all tracks are so good and well-made.  Some track is very dark more like a dark chocolate.  It has a very sad feeling, an intense feeling and exciting feeling.  Overall, a great music CD and it's memorable.
045122499X|2.0|I did get $4. off the price and that was fine, but I did find the book was not in great shape.  Beside the page that the seller mentioned, the entire book seemed as if it had had rough treatment.  The back cover was about ready to tear off.  In view of the above, I did enjoy the book.
B001GM28HO|2.0|Hi. I was not satisfied with the sender and the CD I  bought.  THe plastic top cover was broken when I received it. The CD doesn't work well. The music jumps and forwards to faster playing after 1 week of normal playing. THis is the first CD out of 50 I bought from you I am not satisfied. I will not use that sender in the furure.
B001KO3FFW|2.0|David Cook is a great singer, but he sounds like just any other rock singer/ band out there. He is always going to be compared to Daughtry. This album isn't bad, but it isn't GREAT. It sounds all the same, all rock. There isn't something that stands out to me that can separate him from all the generic labeling. But I gave him two stars for effort and hopefully he can have more variety or differentiation on his album.
0316017922|5.0|It is reflexive, well researched and written. Outliers is one of the rare original books that emerged from the US book writing industry in 2008.
1416500294|4.0|Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins, owners of the Admiral Benbow inn, and their son James \\"Jim,\\" are alternately intrigued and repulsed by the latest lodger, a \\"plain\\" hard-drinking, terrifying-tale-telling man who promises payment to the boy every month for watching out for a \\"...seafaring man with one leg.\\" \\"Black Dog appears and disappears\\" and soon after, the pirate lodger (Billy Bones) dies, still in financial debt to the family. Mrs. Hawkins decides to take what's theirs from the \\"seaman's chest,\\" Mr. Hawkins having passed away, but by then Black Dog has gathered together a band of thieving pirates who know about Bones' treasure trove. The bad guys find the chest, but only after Jim has removed the object of their desire: a map of an island marked, \\"Bulk of treasure here.\\" After locating a ship and crew, Dr. Livesey (a family friend) and the boy head off with them on a ship called the Hispaniola. En route to the island, Hawkins learns about a mutinous plan and shares it with his allies, who plan for their imminent peril, outmanned and outgunned from the start. Young Hawkins, showing cunning and bravery beyond his years, triumphs as a young, inexperienced underdog turned hero. Treasure Island, with its colorful characters, perfect pirate jargon and mannerisms, and ultra-exciting plot is an amazing story, surprisingly first published in 1883. The book on CD, read by Richard Matthews, is a brilliant, five-star find. Also good: The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan, Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer, and Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|I loved this movie!  Lots of action.  I especially liked Downey's particular style of acting - very smooth. Jeff Bridges turned in an excellent performance also. I couldn't get over the unbelievable quality of the blu-ray.  Audio and video are the best I've seen.  There are some very funny lines and actions throughout.  Good acting by Paltrow- she was beautifully stunning in this movie. Lots of special features. Highly recommended.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This picture is amazing, but, ummmm, hopefully you've heard of bluray and aren't looking at this for HDdvd.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|There's lots of action in \\"The Dark Knight\\".  The Joker (Heath Ledger) stole the show.  He played the character perfectly!  Blu-ray quality is outstanding, and the audio is awesome.  I didn't like the fact that the scenes switched from the Imax view to the widescreen with black bars. This took away from the movie in my opinion.  Good special features.  Buy the DVD for Heath Ledger's acting and the good blu-ray video and audio.  The movie is over-rated.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|This album is fun.  Plain and simple... but maybe not so simple...      Some of the track's lyrics have a deep thoughtful meaning if you want to look deeper, but if you're just looking for some catchy psychedelia to listen to while doing whatever it is you do, this is the album.    MGMT reminded me of why I got into music in the first place.
B0018O4YSQ|2.0|Even though the story was meant to keep you wondering what was really happening, I found it to be rather boring and complicated. Scenes with the bald guys recurred too often and were not interesting. There are some good special features.  Director's cut offered considerably more content.  For a movie which was supposed to be dark, the quality was good, but the scenery was bland.
159448385X|1.0|What am I missing here? The title sounds hopeful, the story is NOT. Very depressing. Black and white characters in a backdrop of occupation and war. Not for me.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This item came to me in plenty of time, and it was in good condition.  I was impressed.
B001CZVVVE|4.0|Once again the Blu-ray format has brought new life and impact to a classical concert. Both the picture and sound are stunning - whether you select the DTS or PCM soundtracks you will not be disappointed. The added resolution and colour definition make the picture really come alive. The singers and orchestra both perform without fault. However, the program itself is quite acceptable, but definitely not inspired.   This recording has three shortcomings which prevented me from giving it a 5-star rating. First, the camera work leaves a lot to be desired. There is definitely too much zooming - in some concerts this would not be a problem but for this kind of material it is quite distracting. This is not the best example of TV direction -- while it may be considered acceptable in some circles it definitely does not enhance the overall impact in this kind of venue. Secondly, the subtitles are often difficult to read against a white background - I cannot understand why they cannot impose these on a grey background to improve readability. And thirdly, there are some odd camera angles and as in other discs I have reviewed the camera does not stay on the singers when they are actually singing - it often cuts away to the orchestra or audience and all the viewer sees is the singer's back. Too often, the camera zooms in or out from the singer. Surely TV directors should realize that overuse of zooms and cutaways is not acceptable or artistic in a recording of this kind from a prestigious company like DG.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby) and Ted Hanover (Fred Astair) are two friends who are into the entertainment business, one of them opens up a special resort called \\"Holiday Inn\\" which offers quality food and entertainment for it's only open on major holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiven, Licoln Day etc. but there is a beautiful woman (Majorie Reynolds) as they compete to get the girl.<br /><br />A spectacular and funny musical comedy with great original songs by music writer Irving Berlin and Bing Crosby whom even sang the unforgettable \\"White Christmas\\". The plot is a little hard at times but there is great performances from the main cast including some crowd pleasing musical numbers with great dance sequences. This movie went one to be one of the top grossing movies of 1942 for Paramount and an instant classic that later got semi-remade as \\"White Christmas\\" in 1954 but this is the better movie in my opinion.<br /><br />This DVD set contains both the original black and white and colored versions with great picture and sound! a bonus music CD with the timeless Bing Crosby and Irvin Berlin songs, three featurettes, audio commentary, and trailer.
B001ED7C5I|4.0|I have been a fan since her 1st release.  I really enjoy the CD, it's mellow  and classic Tracy.  You go girl!
B000089RVX|5.0|The CD is great, just enough metal to wake you up, but there is also a much softer side to it in Amy Lee's voice.  I LOVE it.
0312944098|5.0|It has been a long time since I read a book that I couldn't put down. The story is tightly woven, well-written, engaging, and fulfilling. It begins with a proposal of marriage on a night that sets the stage for the rest of the story. Archer has woven betrayal, intrigue, love, friendship, and loyalty into a very satisfying and beautiful story. The ending is the only thing that is predictable but still satisfying.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  It's a little old school, but it rocks just as much today as it did in the 80's.  You can't get better than classic U2.
0765318741|3.0|I read this because some science fiction critic said it was \\"better than Robinson Crusoe.\\"<br />Not quite.<br />\\"I am Legend\\" is a pretty compelling metaphor for isolation (and isolationism), but the author lets a lot of that tension run to waste  by devoting the middle portion of the story to a bogus Freudian/science-fictional explanation of where the vampires came from, why crosses repel them, blah blah blah...<br />I suppose it's an important contribution to the evolving vampire mythos (though I'm not sure that's a good thing if \\"Twilight\\" is what we get from it), but it could have been something even better:  a truly atmospheric story throughout.  That, to me, would have been even more valuable.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I was very happy to see that the Godfather was released in Blu-ray. A perfect gift for someone...of the best movie ever.  Great collection and I received it in a very timely manner.
B000063V8U|5.0|I like the next generation better than the original star trek. The original was done in the sixties and was very limited to special effect's. The first Enterprise corridors where to square and boxy. The next generations Enterprise where smaller had screens and intercoms all built into the walls where on the Original star trek it was just the intercoms.
0316017922|3.0|I happened to come across a copy that is not taken by 800 plus people waiting in public library system and read it over one weekend.  NYT Kakutani lady already dissed him I don't have to say much but it made me think.  He tells stories that are not really true or interesting in such way you just want to eat it whole anyway. This must be his greatest gift. And he is always soft on women and children, which is nice.  We know that there is no more feudal-ly place than Japanese rice paddy in the history. They are called 'water drinking only' farmers because they could not eat one grain of rice they harvested for their load let alone get killed by slashing of sword on the spot if ever splashed one drop of water onto low of the lowestest henchman of samurai class by accident while working hard. Talk about rewards for your hard work!  Michiko is a second generation of Japanese intellectual and smart enough not to dig Asian issues, Korean air pilots or rice paddy math kids, but I bet anyone in particular race or group of people that Malcolm discussed in this book would say, \\" What is he talking about? dah\\"  yet I am sure everyone enjoyed it and concludes with stuff he must know for sure and his admirer would like to know by now - his own family history.  Well, if what he said at some semminer I went before is true and Gladwell's law comes to action, meaning every kids can go to Hunter college HS here in NYC, what then happen to all kids that graduate from Hunter? Surely more competition to get in to limited seat of elite-ist  colleges even Malcolm's law makes every college equally elite -sh as ivies, then what? 1000s of  Bill Gate and 1000s of  Microsoft could not possibly compete in the market and I doubt every outlier would come up with something that is outstanding enough to beat competitors who are yet other million outliers thanks to Gladwell's law.  He knows it won't happen so he can only suggest, write about it and let us dream about it.  Oh, well Gladwell.
B000NA297O|5.0|Even thou this is only for the first 5 seasons I have all eight and I really enjoyed this TV Series. With Grace always hanging on Will but Will trying to have a life of his own but still trying to use Grace as a crutch for his being gay. Finally at the end of season eight Will ends up with a Guy who is a cop and Grace end up with a guy who she divorces then gets back together with him. Both Will and the cop adopted a kid and Grace and her guy end up having a Kid. The Kids end up living in a coed dorm across the hall from each other.
B0017M8XS6|5.0|What can i say, it's one of my best SACDs, once i heard a 5.1 SACD, its hard to go back to regular CDs, this one is no exception, it's superb, I can't believe these HI-FI purists giving this SACD a less than 5 rating, all i can say about that is, you can't please everyone. i just feel when i hear good music/sound, I know when i love it, This is WAY better than a standard CD, but i guess i am just easy to please. I am sure if you have 10 grand or more to spend on a \\"super duper HiFi top of the line stereo/turntable system (with perfect LPs)\\" you can tell some differences between LPs/CDs and the like, but for just a little bit of money, you can listen to SACDs like you have never heard the music before. I have a Playstation 3, >HDMI to Onkyo 705 > Bose 901s/Bose 2.2s +sub/center and it sounds like heaven. If you have a PS3. go to ps3sacd.com  tp get the right receiver for the SACD multi-channel output. otherwise, get a stand alone SACD player (less that 100.00 on ebay (harmon-kardon/refurbished)) and a half decent receiver/amp and some good speakers and enjoy the bliss.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|Will & Grace, A gay Man and a straight woman. In one of the episodes grace tried to marry Will when they where in collage, but come to find out Grace turns Will into a prancing Queen and ever since then that has been a running joke on the show, how Grace turns guys gay when she trys to marry them. Even thou this should be on the DVD for Season eight. It is nice to have the finale on its own Disk. This one I will probably go back to again and again, because it was the end of a different kind of TV show. It was nice to have this show on, but it is also nice to have and ending or to have as they say closure.
B0000E64TR|5.0|Well Worth it if you like to heard good sound. If you have a SACD player/5.1 channel system, you will LOVE this recording. I am not reviewing the content per se, if you have ever heard Goodbye yellow brick road, then you already like the album or not, I bought this for my wife, but it is so good its one of my favorite SACDs, especially benny and the jets. For those who complain about 5.1 mixes, and how they differ from the original stereo LP, hey, if you see a group live, alot of times they don't play songs the same anyway, so if it seems too different from the original, chalk it up to artistic interpetation, the original artists probably approved or arranged the new 5.1 mixes anyway. For me, once i heard SACDs in 5.1, there is no going back! The only way to listen to SACDs is with the proper setup, The Playstation 3 will play them if you get the proper receiver, one that decodes LPCM thru the HDMI cable, see [...]  for receivers that work, otherwise, get a SACD stand alone player and a 5.1 receiver/amp, see ebay, and ENJOY!!!!
1439102813|5.0|Once I read the first page, I couldn't put this book down.  Lisa Genova did a wonderful job condensing the awful slide into Alzheimer's: the frantic confusions, the erratic appearance of competence, the illusory nature of lucidity, the loss of control, the stunning disbelief that you're changing before your very own eyes, the way others react to your decline, the patience and impatience of caregivers, the humor of the craziness once you know you're safe...(I laughed out loud when Alice rearranged her neighbors' kitchen cupboards and when she went to her office in the middle of the night in her nightgown--but only after I read that she returned home safely.)   Thanks & congratulations to Lisa for writing such a revealing book about such a tragic disease. (If AD is my fate, I hope my family is patient and my nightgown is lovely when I stroll out in the middle of the night.)

0307269752|1.0|I'm astounded reading all the positive reviews and hype for this novel since I personally could not get into it and can't imagine it being worthy of such praise. I felt the first hundred or so pages were quite boring, convoluted and slow - the complete antihesis of what would normally lure me into a mystery/thriller. Perhaps there was something missing/lost in the translation. Or perhaps the characters were too one-dimensional and didn't speak to me at all. Regardless, I gave up around page 200; when I come up with every excuse not to pick up a book I'm reading, I just have to throw in the towel, as there are too many gems out there to discover.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|Well Worth it. If you have a SACD player/5.1 channel system, you will LOVE this recording.

0385340990|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of 2008 - a sweet, fast-paced, wonderful novel about a woman who quite frankly, I can't believe is a work of fiction. I LOVED the characters, and most of all, the protagonist Juliet. She is so full of love, life and is positvely hysterical! The characters and their stories (forming their literary society under false pretenses and right under the noses of the soldiers who occupied Gurnsey Island during the War)  were so real, so absorbing and so enjoyable to learn about. This novel is a perfect blend of historical-fiction and a coming-of-age-discovering-oneself story told from different perspectives via letters, which enable the reader to feel like he/she is uncovering a heretofore undiscovered treasure. I can't stress highly enough how terrific this book is - a \\"must read\\" and \\"must-share\\" novel!
B00003CXPD|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. If you haven't watched it... You should!
B001F7MSFW|4.0|This is not quite as good as the first movie, but any Hellboy fan needs to make the effort to see it.
B0014DFCMS|3.0|However, I will add a star because of Ellen Page's performance, although I must admit it took a while to take hold with me.  The first fourth of the movie she came off as a 26-year-old smart-mouth instead of a 16-year-old.  Maybe the dialogue improved; maybe I just got used to it.  My wife urged me to rent this film and then wondered why.  About one-third of the way through, I ask her if she thought anything was ever going to happen.  She replied that she hoped so, but it hadn't to that point.  The attitude this film toward teenage pregnancy was so cavalier as to be off-putting on its own.  I guess they've never heard that it is the number one cause of poverty among women.  The movie hardly touched on the powerful emotions that such an experience would create in a young girl.  There was the inevitable put-down of the only person in the movie who made any sense - the ultrasound technician.  The Hollywood elites apparently thought it mandatory to allow moral relativism once again to triumph over common sense.  And by the way, the music throughout this movie was insipid.  From the technical perspective, the blu-ray had excellent colors and was crisp throughout.
0345472322|4.0|I found this an interesting read and helpful for raising children or motivating workers under your supervision.
1594201927|4.0|The book represents an enormous amount of work and is fantastic from the scholarly perspective. The author is, obviously, a man of extraordinary intelligence. I expected a little lighter, less detailed writing, however. The organization of the work eludes me at times with flashbacks and switchbacks in time and location.  The author assumes a degree of famiarity with finacial lingo without which the reader would be lost. This book is not for the novice who I don't believe will finish it.
0375826726|5.0|I'm really enjoying the Eragon cycle.  I think you can tell how Christopher Paolini has matured as a writer when you compare Eragon to Brisingr.  The characters are well-thought-out and interesting.  And as a woman, I find it very refreshing to read a fantasy novel that doesn't just have one great female character as the love interest.  This series has so many amazing female characters!  Brisingr doesn't have as much action or battle sequences as the previous two books but if you've read those, you'll enjoy learning more about the background of the characters and the mysteries behind Gallbatorix's powers that you find in Brisingr.  I can't wait for the last book to come out!!!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Received CD promptly in well sealed package. Beautiful listening! Very satisfied with quality product and handling. Would recommend. Thanks!!
0060507772|5.0|If you are a fan of the discworld series you mst read The Last Hero.  I was unsure if it would be worth it at first, because it is a more expensive book for a shorter story, but the artwork makes it totally worth it.  And the story is standard Pratchett quality.
0545128285|5.0|The tales of Beedle the Bard is a must have of any fan of Harry Potter.  It was a wonderful early Christmas present for me!  Make sure you also have on hand, Fantastic beasts and where to find them (another wonderful book by Jo Rowling that proceeds go to charity as well).      The tales of Beedle the Bard is hard to put down once you start.
B001CD6FKS|2.0|This movie put me to sleep, literally.  My kids were confused by the back-and-forth beginning.      However, the graphics were excellent, and it should shine on HD.
B0013TY8QY|2.0|Fallen was a very strong album--heck, I was hooked halfway through hearing the first single on the radio.  And there were a couple strong songs since (Broken and Missing come to mind).  On this one, Call Me When You're Sober and Lithium are strong but overall this album lacks the depth and spirit of Evanescence's first offering.    I'm not sure if it's the lack of a male vocalist, or the loss of the influence on the songwriting that killed this album.  I'd rather listen to Hungry Lucy, Within Temptation, or of course Fallen than this.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Doctor Who is always good. Every season gets better and the end of this season is just full of Awesomeness!!! [[ASIN:B001DJ7PQ4 Doctor Who: The Complete Fourth Series]] is a Must-have for Doctor Who fans. Donna Noble adds a different spin on the Doctor's companion for this series. Funny stuff and surprises, lie ahead in Series 4. David Tennant is great. Bonus features are good; includes: Doctor Who Confidential, David Tennant's Video Diary and the 2007 Christmas Special (Disc 1 of the set) and much more.<br /><br />I can't wait until the Doctor Who 2008 Christmas Special: The Next Doctor. I can't believe David Tennant will not be the Doctor in Series 5. :( Well at least there are four specials with him as the Doctor to look forward to in 2009-early 2010. Allons-y!
0345444051|4.0|Arthur C. Clarke was a writer a great imagination and prescience.  His science fiction tales are fantastical and sometimes frightening in their prophecies for the human race.  Perhaps his most famous tale of what might happen to man in regards to the cosmos is \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", but Clarke's 1953 novel \\"Childhood's End\\" is just as disturbing a look at the very last generation of man on Earth.<br /><br />The novel begins with the Secretary-General of the United Nations holding his usual meeting with an alien species they have termed the Overlords.  The Overlords arrived mysteriously one day, their giant ships hovering over every major city on earth, but they did not come to conquer, merely to observe and guide humanity through its unknown transition.  The Overlords will not reveal themselves initially to humans, which causes suspicion among many who doubt the intentions of their alien guardians.  Fifty years later, when man has become comfortable with the new world the aliens have wrought, one of great peace and prosperity, their alien watchers reveal themselves and the true course that humanity will take.<br /><br />\\"Childhood's End\\" is a quick-paced and fascinating read, filled with some imaginings that are all too real.  Clarke's vision of technical advances for the future were sometimes spot-on, and his treatise of the end of the world is laced with a wry humor and sarcasm.  Yet for all of its enigmatic buildup, the last fifty pages of \\"Childhood's End\\" seems to derail from the inital story.  While readers are introduced to a variety of characters and several different plotlines, by the novel's end there seems to be too little to tie these together with what happens to the last race of mankind.  Still, it is an impressive tale, one that touches on many themes and questions that still resonate today.
B000P5FH3K|1.0|A 22 year old man is denied the Cadillac of medical care, a bone transplant, after purchasing the Gremlin of medical insurance from a small company.  The movie attempts to arouse sympathy, but provides a jaundiced view of reality.  The fact is the patient would still have been eligible for all the medical care the safety net of Medicaid and Medicare provide, plus the basics his low quality insurance would have provided. This includes visiting nurses, pain management, etc.  We are supposed to believe an employee of the insurance company wrote a letter to the family calling them, \\"STUPID, STUPID, STUPID\\".  I worked in the insurance business and anyone who did that would be FIRED.  Thus, the plot of this film insulted my intelligence.  If the patient had sound basis for a lawsuit an established attorney would have taken the case.  Instead he winds up represented by a fresh law school grad.  I resent being manipulated to believe our flawed medical and insurance systems are even worse than they really are.  You will not enjoy this movie, unless you are very gullible.  It is also depressing and fails to offer good background music, scenery, or any comic relief.  Even the romantic interest is disgusting presenting a battered woman who is married.
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|If you like Star Wars, then you should see this. The plot was solid and the action was nonstop from start to end. There should be another non cartoon movie like this. It was as good as a real movie though too...
B001C08RHA|4.0|Director Jon Favreau's \\"Iron Man\\" may lack the epic stature of \\"The Dark Knight,\\" but it's more entertaining. Thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s inspired brilliance, this Marvel adaptation captures the fun and wonderment missing in the \\"Spider-Man\\" franchise. Favreau maintains the ideal balance of humor and action without resorting to CGI overkill. Downey  receives excellent support from Gwyneth Paltrow and classic villainy from Jeff Bridges. \\"Iron Man\\" is the rare comic-book movie that transcends its source material.
B001EM1E94|4.0|A live-action Terry Pratchett movie is either doomed to fail in every way, or succeed in practically everything.<br /><br />And \\"The Colour of Magic,\\" adapted from the first two novels in Pratchett's brilliant Discworld series, is more the former than the latter. This one is no \\"Hogather\\" -- it has rather slack direction at times -- but it preserves Pratchett's wry satirical sense of humour. And of course, it's all about a mercenary, cowardly failed wizard.<br /><br />Rincewind (David Jason) is ejected from the Unseen University, on the very day that Twoflower (Sean Astin) arrives with his many-legged Luggage. He's come to the Disc... to \\"look at it.\\" But after Rincewind tries to con Twoflower, the Patrician (Jeremy Irons) orders Rincewind to be the guide/bodyguard of the Disc's first ever tourist.<br /><br />After a massive fire sweeps through the city, the two end up fleeing Ankh-Morpork and running into all sorts of weird things -- a very assertive magic sword, a floating island full of see-through dragons, a dramatic dragonlady in a leather bikini, astrozoologists trying to determine Great A'Tuin's gender, the aged Cohen the (retired) Barbarian, druids, and even getting thrown clear off the Disc in a strange spacecraft. And you thought YOU had problems.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Unseen University is having troubles of its own -- the magical book Octavo is acting weird, and power-hungry Trymon (Tim Curry) is scheming against the Archchancellor. Even worse, a strange red star has appeared in the sky, and the world is facing destruction. The only thing that can save it is the spell in Rincewind's head.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because it's based on the first, roughest Discworld books, but \\"Colour of Magic\\" is not quite as funny or tightly-written as its predecessor, \\"Hogather.\\" The writing is not quite as complex or as witty, and the direction sometimes feels a bit slack (such as the bar fight scene, or Trymon skulking and schemind around the University).<br /><br />But despite these drawbacks, \\"Colour of Magic\\" is still a vastly entertaining story -- it has a solid plotline and it chugs away nicely after a somewhat sluggish beginning, and blossoms into full-out complexity about halfway through.  Once it gets underway it starts to resemble a road-trip through fantasy-land, with our quirky tourist and wizard bungling their way across the Disc.<br /><br />Along the way there's some fun action (an upside-down duel), humorous dialogue (\\"You weren't born with a mysterious birthmark in the shape of a crown, were you?\\"), and a general air of tongue-in-cheekness.  Best of all, it's a fantasy spoof -- Vadim Jean preserves Pratchett's clever satire aimed at the staples of your average fantasy: fantasy babes, prophecies, magic swords, retired barbarians, powerful artifacts, and even the idea of reality warping itself to save the \\"hero.\\"<br /><br />Jason is wonderfully snivelly and sour as Rincewind, a failed wizard who basically finds himself repeatedly swept up into bizarre, deadly circumstances even though he didn't want to be involved. Astin is even better as the hilariously oblivious Twoflower, who regards every disaster as yet another great adventure (\\"We're going to run out of world!\\" \\"I have to see that!\\").<br /><br />And there's a talented supporting cast -- Curry chews the scenery with sneering aplomb, Karen David plays a humorously over-the-top dragon-lady, and Irons has a small but wonderful role as the chilly, efficient Vetinari. And of course, the brilliant Christopher Lee takes over as an increasingly disappointed Death.<br /><br />\\"Colour of Magic\\" isn't as tightly directed as it could have been, but it still manages to be clever and quite amusing.c\\" is still a vastly entertaining story -- it has a solid plotline and it chugs away nicely after a somewhat sluggish beginning, and blossoms into full-out complexity about halfway through.

B000HIVIOW|4.0|I first saw this on PBS, back when it was new, and I recorded it and watched it many, many times with my son.  It's very soft and tranquilizing, as the landscapes are hushed by snow, and no words are ever spoken.  The rest is all lulling symphony music, with a lovely vocal interlude during the sweeping flying sequence.  It's a gorgeous little piece of work.<br /><br />Now, the version I saw so long ago did in fact have David Bowie as the man introducing it.  But this was an edit for American television.  I bought a different copy of this a few years back (a DVD which included another Christmas cartoon), and it had the original introduction restored to it.  And I know that this is the original opening because it begins with the narrator walking along the edge of an open field in front of the woods, the same woods that in the next instant become the animated landscape, where the story begins.  That's the version that's on this DVD, the original version, and I know this because it arrived today.  But who narrates the introduction doesn't matter.  This is an artfully crafted work to be treasured in any library, and I wouldn't let the fact that Bowie isn't introducing it from a cozy attic discourage my owning it.  Yes, for the sake of nostalgia, I wouldn't mind seeing that one again, but for the sake of collecting, I'll settle for this original edit.<br /><br />Only a grownup can really appreciate the level of artistry that went into this 27-minute confection, but children, too, are enthralled by it for other reasons.  Watch it with them, and have a real moment you'll keep for a lifetime.  I did.<br />______________________________________
B000GTLQXU|5.0|Okay, I've heard and read all the reviews about how cheesy this movie is.  But it's not supposed to be rocket science.  It's not even supposed to be real.  However, I honestly have no plans to take a cruise anytime soon.    Josh Lucas was wonderful as the reluctant hero.  He did not want to be responsible for these people; but as they slowly ascended the ship - and tragedy after tragedy began to strike - you saw his pain in his inability to stop things from happening.    Mia Maestro was fantastic as the stowaway.  Going up the vent with the water slowly rising - I was with her every step of the way.   And even Josh Lucas right behind me, either yelling at me or encouraging me, would not have made the going any easier.    Kurt Russell... Can I just say I love Kurt Russell?  Always have.  He was superb as the overbearing dad - former fireman - ex-mayor.  His concern for his daughter was soooo real.  And his ultimate sacrifice... well, I'm not gonna ruin this for anyone who's not seen it yet.    Kevin Dillon was great as the drunk loudmouth; Emmy Rossum and Mike Vogel very believable young lovers; Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennett as mother/son; and Richard Dreyfuss... well, I'm not gonna tell you everything.    Probably the most impressive actor in this movie was that WAVE.  As Dreyfuss stands on the deck, you see a look of utter horror and panic on his face as the wave begins to blot out the moon... Fantastic!  The beginning of the end.    Like I said, it's not rocket science, but it's a fun adventure movie, if you're into that kind of thing.  Definitely a \\"must see\\" movie if you're a fan of any of these actors.
0545128285|4.0|A great, fast read for fans of the famed Harry Potter series, this latest book from the \\"world\\" of Potter features five folklore vignettes: \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,\\" \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune,\\" \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart,\\" \\"Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump\\" and \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers.\\" The final story is, of course, instrumental in the seventh and final chapter of Harry's life. Each has a moral for wizards and Muggles alike, which are reflected upon after the tale by Albus Dumbledore from his private notes on the stories. Hermione Granger, we're told, translated the tales from the ancient runes.<br /><br />Easily readable in an hour or two, I made my way quickly through the book and found it enjoyable. As these are basically childrens' tales with commentary by J.K. Rowling and Dumbledore, powerful wizard and Harry's mentor, you're not going to find anything earth-shattering in these pages. But that's not the point of them.<br /><br />Any fan of Potter will be delighted to relive one hundred pages with Dumbledore's running dialogue, and there's some insight to be gained about the Wizarding world from Beedle, who lived in the fifteenth century. If you're not into Harry, there probably won't be much here for you. But Rowling fans will be delighted to spend another evening reliving the magic that originally brought us all to Harry in the first place.
B000W4HIX6|4.0|The film was watched on a 50\\" Panasonic Plasma, and LG BH200 Blu-Ray player. The PQ was a 3.5/5 and AQ a 5/5.<br /><br />The film holds up well for the time period, and the premise of the couple on the fritz caught up in an unlikely and dangerous terrorist plot, adds an edge that is still relatable in terms of realism. Bruce Willis plays one of his, if not his best known, role well and entertains with his diligence and \\"Boyscout\\" ingenuity. We enjoyed this film, but I could not give it 5 stars, due to its lacking Blu-Ray transfer.<br /><br />This is one of Fox's better transfers for an older film, but the picture is not as sharp as it could have been. The sound however, was powerful and thrust the action forward with a crystal clear and thunderous soundtrack. I have not seen all of these parts of Die Hard, but look forward to watching them in succession over the next few months. If you're a fan of the central character and the premise, pick these up for your collection. They're action staples.
0385338732|3.0|I'm a fan of Kinsella so pushed my way through this novel, but I'm happy I got it as an ARC and didn't actually have to pay for it in hardcover -- I was disappointed. The exploration of relationships (romantic, familial, friendly, etc.) is a tenant of chick lit, I think, and I found this book to be lacking in pretty much every area.<br /><br />Main character Lexi is, to me, a wholly unlikeable character -- both before she's in the accident and after. Once a dowdy woman lacking direction and enjoying good times with her girl friends, she wakes up one day smack in the middle of a beautiful life without any recollection of how she got there. Involved in a terrible accident seven years earlier, Lexi has been living a sort of \\"fantasy\\" life ever since then -- and now she can't recall any of it.<br /><br />While the book was light and humorous, I still wanted more depth from the characters. I know not every novel is going to change your life, but I wanted more from Lexi -- and more from her friends, more from her emotionally vacant husband. I just couldn't inhale it the way I wanted to.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I am very sorry to disagree with the masses but this movie was sub-par at best.  I completely agree with RBR Crazywater's review.  Where shall I begin?<br /><br />The action was too confusing.  It appeared and begun too haphazardly and perhaps, in an unpredictable manner, TOO randomly.  Do you remember how people would make fun of Batman's utility belt having just the right gadget for every possible scenario?  It was the same here for the Joker.  He always had the perfect set-up.  He just happened to be disguised as his own henchman?  He just happened to have a bomb planted in a criminal who just happened to be arrested and brought to the same jail?  He just happened to have 4000 pounds of explosives planted at the right place at the right time?  he just ALWAYS happened to have the right \\"paid off\\" cop in the right place at the right time?  It was a little too much....even for a comic book movie.  The Marvel movies never were that absurd with inserting thier reality into thier comic book universe.<br /><br />Christian Bale was not good at all.  He was surrounded by greatness.  Heath Leger, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and even Eric Roberts were all great.  Bale was not.  Poor screenplay was a factor as Bruce Wayne's lines were trite, mostly irrelevant, and outright uninteresting.  One of the most important componants of ANY BAtman story is the psychology of Bruce Wayne and how it affects Batman's decisions and actions and hence, his environment and supporting cast.  This was completely absent from this movie.  Bruce Wayne was as important to the plot as one of the common thugs.<br /><br />What is up with Batman's voice.  It was so intential that it was annoying and disgusting.  STOP IT!!!!<br /><br />This was NOT a Batman movie.  It was a James Bond installment.  With the last movie I was upset enough that Batman didn't invent his own \\"toys\\" like in all previous incarnations, but this movie was just too much.  Christian Bale was James Bond and Morgan Freeman was basically Q.  Combine that with the schene in Hong Kong so as to add international intrigue and suspense, and it is a 007 flick.<br /><br />Summation of the bad points.  I love the character of Batman but he was a non-factor in this movie.  It was dark, visually confusing, had a non-linear plot (anything that happened could have happened at any point.) and basically left me feeling depressed and unsatisfied.<br /><br />there are a few good points however. Although not his best role ever, I still think that Gary Oldman is the greatest and most talented actor in the world today.  Also, in line with what everyone has ever said, Heath Leger's performance was probably the greatest acting performance I have EVER seen in my life.  HE and HE alone WAS the movie.  Please...he deserves the Oscar (and not just because of his tragedy.)<br /><br />Watch this movie if your are a comic book /superhero geek like me.  Watch it if you want to see an incredible portrayal of the Joker. Please do not tell me it is a 5-star movie, or that it is the best comic book movie ever, because you would be way way way way off. (I choose Spiderman 1, or 1978's Superman 1)<br /><br />Again, sorry to disagree with the masses, but I have been a DC comic and Batman fanatic for over 30 years.  Please weigh my opinions accordingly.  Thank you for your time.ne that with the schene in Hong Kong so as to add international intrigue and suspense, and it is a 007 flick.

B00008G9JN|5.0|Songs from the Wood has to stand up as one of the best albums by anybody, and is surely one of Tull's best. The album offers one great song after the other. The bonus tracks are definately worth the price of admission. Once again the level of playing and production are top shelf. A very infectious album...the melodies and lyrics stay with you. Luckily I got to see Tull at Madison Square Garden during this era. To see and hear many of the songs played live was wonderful(as well as some songs from Heavy Horses). Any Tull fan who wrote a negative review for this album should revisit it. Many Jethro Tull albums improve with time like a fine wine! Cheers.

1400049628|5.0|A definite must have for the die hard zombie enthusiast. I received this gift for Christmas a few years back and couldn't put it down! The Zombie Survival Guide is written in the fashion of a classic wilderness survival manual yet from a humorous perspective. I would recommend this book to all zombie fans who enjoyed movies like the classic 1978 version of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead or for those preparing for the inevitable zombie apocalypse.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I would highly recommend this product to any Star Wars lover. The Digital Remastering makes the series seem like brand new, and the audio is great, too. I'm definitely going to get my money's worth out of this purchase.
B000E41MS6|5.0|First time shopper. Service was great and the price compared to the stores was awesome. I will return.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|I Am Legend is another action flick release by Will Smith.  This time Mr. Smith stars as Robert Neville, a US military scientist who helped create a virus-based vaccine against cancer that ends up becoming contagious, spreading to the entire human population, killing of 90% of humans, and turning most of the survivors into cannibalistic, light-hating creatures; i.e. vampire - zombies called Darkseekers.  Most of the movie takes place in New York City, specifically in Neville's town home, and in the streets and buildings of Manhattan.      The drawbacks of the movie are primarily in the plot; specifically there are some very dumb scenes.  Probably the biggest is the lack of firepower wielded by Dr. Neville.  We learn in the movie that Dr. Neville happens to be an Army officer.  We also see that Dr. Neville has been living alone in NYC for several years, often fighting of Darkseekers.  Dr. Neville also has a lot of time every single day to drive thru the city, stop of at music and DVD stores to \\"rent\\" movies and CD's, arrange various store mannequins to provide him \\"company\\", play golf, and chase animals that have escaped from the local zoos.  Yet in the entire movie, Dr. Neville has only three guns on him, an automatic rifle, and two handguns.  For someone living in a city full of zombies that want to eat him, who has military training, and who has a lot of time to acquire firearms in a city that must be full of gun shops, I would think Dr. Neville would be loaded with guns.  In the final scene when the Darkseekers storm his house, he uses a grand total of 1 gun with 1 clip, and 1 grenade.  This is preposterous.  I would have hundreds of firearms in that house, several per room, with lots of ammunition clips around.    A second stupid scene in the movie is when Dr. Nevill falls into the Darkseekers' trap and gets strung up by his leg.  For a sober Army officer to fall into such a simple trap is ludicrous and mind-boggling.    Probably the dumbest part of the movie iswhy doesn't Dr. Neville start demolishing the hiding places of the Darkseekers.  He clearly knows how to construct and use explosives, as shown in the movie's climax.  And he clearly has the time to do this, so why does he not start blowing up various dark spots throughout the city as a way of clearing out the Darkseekers?    So all in all, this is a movie with a great premise and good acting, but some big plot holes that lead to very stupid scenes.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Splendid...absolutely splendid! Best season yet in my opinion!  As for Amazon's part...FAST delivery and packaged well!
193413712X|5.0|It is so fitting that this beautiful book - likely to be a favorite of yours, much as mine, one to which you will return time and again to savor a word, a line, a passage which you simply had to see again; in order to reveal new layers of meaning with every reading - has come out into the open during the holiday season. What book could possibly be better to curl up with during this season of brotherly love, than Paul Harding's \\"Tinkers\\"?    Even while this book has the propensity to appeal to any reader in its simply lovely recounting of a touching tale of generations of family, along with other vividly rendered lives met along the way, \\"Tinkers\\" is a profound, empathic and soulful work of art as well, replete with the most stunning descriptions, written in both tight as well as strikingly beautiful language, all of which blend together to create the sense of a whisper of holiness emanating from within nature and humanity.     I am reminded of a traditional blessing which is meant to be recited when one encounters a crowd of six hundred thousand people. The blessing praises God as `Sage of Secrets'. The intention being, that only God has the capacity to truly comprehend the individual cosmology of each and every one of the many souls on earth. Well, in writing `Tinkers', I believe that Paul Harding has humbly shown himself to be one who naturally emulates this divine trait, who is that empathic. With tender awareness and precision of language, Harding's heart shines through, in this brilliant, existential, and profoundly human work of literature, to reveal to us, in the sense of true revelation, the different souls who inhabit this book. He is so finely attuned to the human condition in all of its complexity, in all of its varied individual experiences, that Paul Harding can truly be called, \\"Sage of Secrets\\".    Harding's generosity of spirit reverberates throughout, as he guides us from a man hallucinating on his death bed, the very bed seeming to crash inwards asinto a tomb of sorts which acts as a vortex for  the fabric of all his personal history and ultimately that of the entire cosmos, into the souls of generations of men in this story, who seem to be tinkering with and studying the mechanisms of the world - of the cosmos, of nature, of epileptic seizures, of illness, of humanity, of mind, of belief, of inflation and deflation of ego, of clockwork, of time, of space, of hearts, of souls, of families, of love, of will, of loyalty... -  in myriad ways, trying to make sense of it all, reaching for some grasp of how `it' works, wondering the extent to which they have impact, where they are in it all, whether through grappling in sermons,  blending into nature, human interaction, providing healing and solace, supplying material needs, fixing household items, mending clocks... even as their thoughts seem to leak into each other's souls through a mystical connection of sorts which defies conventions such as time, as voice, as proximity, as life, as death... And into the souls as well, of - a haggard country wife whose will has broken; a hermit who doesn't speak, with whom a lovely silent ritual is forged; an ambivalent wife and mother; a chatty devoted wife; a dedicated grandson with conflicted thoughts; a child with slowed development; to name but a few, and even the perspectives of fish, of flies, of a cat, of a dog...     And finally, the description of how to make a nest, seemed to me to speak, in its loving detail, of the yearning for a home, and what a real home might caringly be constructed of on so many levels. Beautiful!
0895260131|1.0|If you are a racist or a bigot, then this book is for you.<br /><br />However, if you are NOT an intolerant xenophobe, then you should make sure you do not even touch this book with a ten foot pole.<br /><br />Reading this book to learn about Islam is equivalent to looking to Timothy McVeigh for more information about Christianity.<br /><br />This book is an attempt to distort a faith and its followers in a way that makes it seem as if there is a 90% chance your neighbor \\"Ahmed\\" is a bloodthirsty terrorist waiting for the right moment to kill you and your family.<br /><br />Spencer's reprehensible book is riddled with factual inaccuracies, and to put it in layman's terms: it is plain, flat-out WRONG.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: stay away from this book. If you really want to learn about a religion, what is the logical thing to do? Look at the scripture of that religion. If you wanted to learn about Christianity, you would read the Bible.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you want to learn about Islam, this is not the book for you. Buy a Quran with an english translation (if that is your native tongue). I recommend the Yusuf Ali translation: [[ASIN:1853267821 The Holy Qur'an]]  Or you can just google for Quran and find an online, free copy. There you go; after 5 minutes of reading the Quran, you will know more about Islam than after 50 hours of reading and reviewing Spencer's book.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|I was sooo expecting a repeat of the last three thrilling Indy Adventures. This was Ok if you had never seen the others, but disappointing for Indy fans.

B001GKJ2F2|4.0|Having read the comics that this movie is based on, I understand why they went in this direction and it makes sense.

It really shows people that we are not just what our DNA says, but a part of of culture and ancestry that truly helps dictate our future along with our DNA.  Gladwell truly knows how to capture and reveal human behavior through statistical analysis, not just theories.
B000EE7ZUK|5.0|Not for real.  A comedic hoax.  Some people think they are actually in it for the music.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|great fun. not a big fan of Ben Stiller, but this one is great. Loved the references to other movies. I even liked Jack Black in this one. Too bad Coogan got killed off too soon, but hey! Its war!  Looks great on Blu-Ray.
0316017922|5.0|What do you know about the Power Distance Index? What about the Uncertainty Avoidance factor? How about Individualism vs. Collectivism and where the US compares against the rest of the world? Did you know either of these can predict the behavior of people from various cultures? Did you know it can predict airplane crashes?<br /><br />Have you ever heard of KIPP schools? Did you know there are over 50 of these in the nation that are changing the lives and minds of underprivileged children daily? Did you know that KIPP students achieve more in knowledge then their privileged counterparts?<br /><br />How can you predict a child will become a successful hokey player? What was the best year to be born in order to become a billionaire as an industrialist, or IT tycoon, or the most successful  lawyer?<br />Which is the hardest working agricultural nation in the world(Hint: Not the US)?<br /><br />This book by far is one of my favorite and Malcolm Gladwell's best in my opinion. He writes with great clarity, logic and tremendous common sense that make one consume the pages faster than lunch. It will make you think. Seriously!<br /><br />A very, very high recommendation. Try also his `Blink' and `The Tipping Point'. Another good book in similar manner is `Freakonomics'.
B0000042MY|5.0|Okay, this review is not exactly family-friendly but worth mentioning.  I will try to keep it as \\"PG\\" as possible.  Simply put, I highly recommend both girls and guys to employ this soundtrack during \\"love sessions.\\"  The rhythm and power are uncompromising and it will exponentially heighten your experience.  Pshew.. Is it getting hot in here?
6305511055|5.0|This is a great movie. I had it on VHS, but wanted to have it on DVD. Robert Redford is great in it, but he is great in most every movie. Enjoy

0441013597|5.0|What Herbert creates with Dune is truly unique in the world of sci-fi.  If you are bored with the usual sci-fi fare that seems derivative and predictable, Dune may just be the refresher you are looking for.  Conflicted heroes, depraved villains, and a gripping style that pulls you into his world, Dune is a masterpiece and a must read.
B000006FNX|5.0|Though the movie was a spinoff of Thunderball, it was a fun adventurous story and it was nice to see Sean Connery back as Bond. Very good cast as well. I rate it higher than Thunderball.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Excellent game for evenings with friends. Every game is different and therefore very interesting. You don't know the winner till the end, things change during the game process every turn.  The rules are pretty simple but it will take soem time to learn all of them.  Currently looking forward to buy an extension.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is a beautiful album!   I play it all the time and marvel that she wrote all the songs but one and that one is a stunning cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Make You Feel My Love\\".  Each song is individual but just enough connected to make an entire album.  Even Dylan's song fits right in with her sad, longing, endearing songs.  I could go on and on...
006112429X|5.0|Fascinating, finely honed novel about what happens when, despite all the recommended strategies for parenting, your child totally lacks empathy and connection with other people.  Written from the viewpoint of Kevin's mother, this story keeps you entralled (and horrified), guessing about the plot right up until the end.  Not to be recommended for anyone who's pregnant, but a rivetting read for most other adults.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|Vastly overrated...the movie is too long and there are too many eye-rolling scenes such as Harvey Dent roaming the city with half his face missing and his eyeball ready to fall out if his head.  Heath Ledger is good but his psycho act grows tiresome.  Batman is not a likable character either and whats with the voice.     Very disappointing...
0767827791|1.0|Picnic is a fabulous movie, but do not buy this DVD version as it is in standard screen format - not the original widescreen (like the VHS tape version). The standard screen does not do justice to this movie at all. I don't understand why the VHS (which I have) is widescreen and the much newer DVD (which I bought from Amazon) is standard screen. I should have read the description more carefully.
B0017ANAZO|1.0|The gloriously funny 1939 version of THE WOMEN, one of my favorite films, has been rewritten (in a vain attempt to make it relevant); it has been modernized, vulgarized and generally ruined in this truly awful movie.  There's no sense blaming the actresses.  Most of them are excellent and try hard; indeed, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Bette Midler, Carrie Fisher and several others do their level best to bring some life to this horrible script: to no avail, it's quite hopeless.  Annette Bening is reliably vital and always welcome.  Debra Messing, just the opposite.  Meg Ryan, who looks disturbingly re-engineered, is somewhere in the middle.  Ms. Smith and Ms. Mendes are certainly adequate to their tasks, but there's just no saving this debacle.  I watched it with a growing sense of disappointment accompanied by moments of genuine horror.  Poor Meg Ryan has to say, when describing how she had reliably satisfied her husband in bed, \\"I can suck the nails out of a board and that's a fact.\\"  (Try imagining Norma Shearer delivering THAT line.  No, perhaps you'd better not.)  This movie is worth watching only as a bad example of remakes - a film this awful does exert a kind of fascination: can it really be so bad?  A second viewing confirmed that it can be and is.
0521677467|5.0|All of these books are great.  ive used them for a long time but thought it was about time to have my own copy.  the advanced version really IS advanced though, perhaps a little more than i had anticipated.
1400082773|5.0|One has to keep in mind that this book was originally published in 1995. I was born the same year as Obama (1961) - I must say that by age 34 Obama had considered, done, and written about things that I had yet to consider in much depth. A mixed racial heritage (black father, white mother) combined with a multi-cultural background (Indonesia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kenya) yielded a man with supple thinking and a nuanced approach to life. Forgetting for a moment that this man is president-elect of the United States of America, I must say that Obama can write a compelling narrative. Obama appears to have the intellect, the good judgment, and the disposition (cool under pressure) to excel at the job of US president. This book provides a view into Obama's multi-textured youth.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|We got the movie in a very timely fashion and in very good condition.  Will buy again from this site.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|when i got this set, i watched the dvd. i was astonished! david puts on such a production. every minute of the show was breathtaking. definately a must for all pink floyd / or david gilmour lovers. also, this could have been his last performance due to the death of richard wright.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This is just a note to confirm that this product truly is the actual soundtrack of the movie. Earlier, I was fooled into buying a cheap, synthesizer version of music \\"from\\" the movie. Rest assured that this CD contains the same rich, magnificent music (instrumental and vocal) from Return of the King that you remember. It will trigger the same emotions.<br /><br />It was nice that Annie Lennox's \\"Into the West\\" was included as the final track.
B000QFCD2W|5.0|Wow, what a disc King and crew have put together! This is some of the finest metal you'll ever hear out there.Period. As always, the production is first rate, as is the musicianship. And the composition and execution of the story is tight ,taut and interesting.As a long time KD and MF fan ,I can say that this stacks up with all his best work like Abigail.Yeah, I still miss Mikkey Dee, but Matt Thompson just kills it on this cd. [And Motorhead might have needed Mikkey more than King anyway...]  What can I say about the guitar work, these guys are consummate musicians. The phrasing,lyricism and balls of the solos is top notch. Checkout Mike Wead's solo on the title track, I haven't heard a solo phrased that well since Adrian Smith's finest work with Iron Maiden. And they have the chops to make it sound easy.Very musical too, no shredding for shred's sake at all, the sign of mature craftsmen.Hat's off to Andy,King ,Hal Mike, and Matt. Keep doing it fellas, we love it!

B000002G89|5.0|Just as Songs in the Key of Life is perhaps, several years after the fact, a monumental classic that Stevie Wonder has not yet been able to equal in his subsequent recordings, the same can be said for 461 Ocean Boulevard relative to the latter forthcomings of none other than the immortal blues guitarist, Mr. Eric Clapton.    Released in 1974, 461 Ocean Boulevard was an unparalleled landmark album in its own right.  Thanks to the inclusion of the number one hit cover of Bob Marley's \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\", it is possibly the primary catalyst to the never-before-witnessed international stage of multiplatinum-selling reggae artists, the first and most famous being Mr. Marley himself. Also, it is arguably the release that not only recharged but also supercharged a career that, with a future in doubt as a result of prior drug addictions and band dissolutions, especially Derek and the Dominos, would turn out to be prolific and enduring.    Other tracks include the great introduction, \\"Motherless Children\\", with Clapton's trademark guitar work as well as the top 40 \\"Willie and the Hand Jive\\". Also contained is the staple \\"Let It Grow\\". Throughout the release is the presence of a backing vocalist who would attain stardom some three years later with the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack release. Who is this person? It is none other than Yvonne Elliman, who would have her only number one hit with the Bee Gees' \\"If I Can't Have You\\".    In sum, questions likely had arisen prior to 1974 as to whether there would even be several Clapton projects ahead, what with the untimely deaths of close friends and fellow guitar greats, Jimi Hendrix and Duane Allman. Fortunately, Clapton is still around.  Though his works from the mid-1970s onward, from an artistic standpoint, might not quite match the masterpiece that is 461 Ocean Boulevard, his decisions to kick the drug habits and to maintain his legacy as a performer who continues to inspire present and future artists are personal triumphs that are far more important than any one particular work of art.
B000UBMZ4S|1.0|My dad bought this and I tried several different things to get this to work (put HD cord in dvd player, played on PS3/comp./dvd player) and nothing worked.  Don't know if it's something with my equipment or it's the DVDs but I never could figure it out.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is absurdly bad. A white elephant. From the start, when you see Alec Baldwin, as an Army Air Corps officer, ordering a couple of US Army pilots to Britain to fight Germans in British RAF fighters, you know this flick is BS. America was a neutral in 1940, no US armed service personel were ever sent that year or the next to fight in the British air force. There was an American squadron that saw service flying British fighters in the Battle of Britain, but they were all volunteer mercenaries, who showed up in the UK dressed in civies. The only thing the US gov't would have done, in the case of the actual mercenary pilots, was to refrain from cancelling their visas, and let them go over. The two aforementioned pilots whom Baldwin sends, Afleck and that other guy, then proceed through the movie, through every major aviation event of the war, like they're Batman and Robin; reaching their climax as participants in the Dolittle Raid (which, it turns out, is Baldwin's role, Col. Dolittle himself, which heightens the bogus nature of this \\"historical\\" production) The romance parts are a real tedious chore to have to put up with, the HOT stuff that From Here to Eternity provided and still provides this is not. There is not a Burt Lancaster or Donna Reed or Sinatra to be found among this pathetic High School drama class calibre cast. The Maudlin atmosphere is so strong that one is forced to notice further slop handling of details on the part of the producers.  The director, back when this was released, bragged about the time and resources spent on producing the special effects \\"this movie is all about special effects\\" I remember him saying. Yeah, and apparently not about accuratly recounting history. Even then, the much ballywhod special effects are a dissapointment. You want to see a still competant film account of Pearl Harbor? Check out Tora!Tora!Tora! It still stands and delivers as a representatiion of these events. Want the weeks leading up to Pearl Harbor presented as sultry times for romance? Then go for the eforementioned From Here to Eternity. Stay away from this turkey. By the way, this system will not let me publish this review without punching in at least one star for it, it does not even deserve that.nted as sultry times for romance?

B000004286|5.0|I bought this for my husband who loves the music on the soundtrack and kept talking about it but never bought it.  We've listened to it a hundred times already between the car and house.
B000000W5L|3.0|Everyone heaps praise on this, but like the Beatles White Album, I think it could have been condensed into one very good album.  Don't get me wrong - there are some great songs here - Sweet Vriginia, Torn and Frayed, Tumbling Dice, etc. - but is Turd on the Run really top notch Stones material?  Ventilator Blues and Just Wanna See His Face also could have been dropped without any big loss.  I know that diehard Stones fans will disagree, but this album has way too much \\"filler\\".
031606792X|3.0|Let's make it clear: I don't like any of these books. Why did I read them? Easy: one does like an escapist book.     OK. Am I the only one who kept begging through the previous 3 books: \\"Somebody please bite her already\\"? Does not matter who: wolves or vampires. Of course, all of them did have some entertainment with her around.    What I like about this book:  - Edward (ever boring) is in the shadow. He is not even the main character here. Thanks.  - Jacob's chapters. Cool. I did not mind the imprinting. Anything that can stop the neverending whining.  - Bella. Finally some strength, some spine. Thanks again.    For people who did not like all the pregnancy and birth scenes: yes, it's not exactly fantasy, is it? But it's life, deal with it. This is where this series comes a little closer to being almost good.    The only reason I gave it 3 stars, is to counter some 1-star reviews that complain about the \\"gone romance and magic\\". I'd say: \\"Good riddance\\".
B001G9LV9S|5.0|This Is a Fantastic album (why No SACD?) as for the Extras on this  set ,theres no extra tracks on the first cd ,even though theres room  Any Cat Stevens fan would eat up any bonus tracks they give us,But  compared with other Universal Deluxe Edition this set seems only good  in terms of Extras,Why in earth do we need cuts from the three dvds?  The Teaser Set is a lot better in terms of Demo's,even if they can't even  include the B-side of the single
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell uses social science case studies and statistical data to debunk common myths we've developed about who we are and what we do: that some people are inherently more prone to success in a particular field, that billionaires and Nobel Prize winners are self-made men and women whose pluck and determination allowed them to rise above their peers, that success is the result of talent or genius alone.    In some respects, randomness determines success (where and when someone is born, into which class someone is born, etc.), Gladwell argues, and this can be humbling in its determinism; but at the end of the day, a family/community tradition of hard work and perseverance play as important a role as anything else (even more so than \\"talent\\"), and that can be uplifting to anyone who wants to maximize their own potential, their children's or our society's.    If you are a fan of Gladwell's other books, you will love this one too.

B000002UB6|1.0|The Beatles were pretty much over by the preceding album (White Album) which consisted mostly of solo performances with some perfunctory overdubs.  This album was their attempt to recapture their \\"roots\\" but they could not rekindle the innocence of bygone years.  Only Billy Preston's keyboard work redeems this otherwise slapped-together effort.  Put it this way: if this album had been a demo by some unknowns, no record company would have touched it.

B001GKJ2ES|3.0|The Movie Wanted is a fantastic trip with very little thought put into the plot. It is supposedly supposed to be an adaptation from the Comic Maxi-Series by Mark Millar. The Only thing that ends up linking the two are the names \\"Professor\\" \\"Fox\\" and \\"Wesley\\"   The movie attempts to gain points by curving bullets and making Wesley a grown up killer instead of the whiny little B***H he starts out as. This transformation doesn't even come close to the transformation he undertakes in the Millar story.   I'm glad Millar got paid to say he liked the film version because money was obviously the only thing on his mind when he saw the pile of crud that is Wanted: The Movie.   I digress though, As a movie just saying it's an action movie with an original plot and idea, it is very entertaining.   As a movie based on a comic however, it is one of the biggest dissapointments since the Fantastic Four or Spider-man 3.
1594201927|4.0|A good read.  Well written.  What we used to call a survey course when I was in college.  Everybody should find something to entertain them and something to bore them.  I didn't notice any stunning insights.  What Ferguson does show is that greed and stupidity will have their day (surprise) but who is to know who's being stupid before the event (a lack of common sense and historical perspective is a clue but who of us have Buffet's self confidence, knowledge, and luck).    As to anybody who thinks this book \\"explains\\" the current crises in such a way they would avoid the same mistakes henceforth....There is bridge for sale somewhere in your future.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|I have to say that I was not to thrilled to see this movie for one reason--Cameron Diaz.  Just not a fan.  However, I gave in to the peer pressure and I watched it, and loved it!  Cameron was awesome! Jude Law was so sweet and warm, Kate Winslet was so real and very charming and (in my opinion) this was Jack Black's best role!  He was adorable!  Someone you would take home to meet your parents!  Of course everything ends, \\"Happily Ever After,\\" but at Christmas, how can you not love a movie like that?  If you haven't seen it and you like romantic comedies, you're truly missing out!

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss' review was spot on. We should all be buying this DVD every day forever. Commentary! has quite a few good tunes on it and the regular commentary track was also very enjoyable. I keep getting impressed at the sound quality of the music. They were all recorded at Whedon's home studio. Must be some home studio!    Really nothing I can add to what has already been said of the Dr H movie (movette? It is rather short for a movie). It's great.

B001EO2UJK|4.0|Five albums are featured in this 3rd and last Genesis box set [Virgin CDBOX 14], each pumped up into a double issue, while the double \\"Lamb\\" is now a 3 Disc set (\\"Lamb\\" is in a Book Pack while the other albums are 2CD jewel cases). Disc 1 of each issue is the SACD and CD Remaster of the album with both mixes encoded onto the disc, while Disc 2 is a DVD with 5.1 Surround Sound with extras tagged on at the end of each. The sixth and final double is called \\"Extra Tracks 1970-1975\\" and features singles, demos and BBC Sessions - again both in Audio and DVD. \\"Extras' is housed in a 48-page hardback book with an essay, band contributions, photos and celebrity reviews...<br /><br />NICK DAVIS prepped the 5.1 Surround Mixes and Stereo CD mixes with the remastering carried out by TONY COUSINS at Metropolis Mastering. Both of these guys handled the preceding box sets to both applause and derision in equal measure. While I admittedly don't have a Surround capability at home, I find the sound quality on the Stereo CD mixes to be GORGEOUS - a revelation. \\"Trespass\\" & \\"Nursery Cryme\\" are hissy in places, but still so much better sounding than the crap 1994 Virgin remasters we've been lumbered with all these years (which in turn were supposed to replace the dire 80's issues). But the great news is \\"Foxtrot\\", \\"Selling\\" and \\"Lamb\\", each of which is now an absolute blast. At 8:15 minutes into \\"Supper's Ready\\" on Foxtrot when the acoustic guitars kick in, I was in floods, huge sound filling my room... We've been waiting 35 years to finally hear these great works in DECENT AUDIO.<br /><br />Here's a detailed breakdown of the sets:<br />Disc 1 (42:33 minutes) is their 2nd album \\"Trespass, originally released on LP in November 1970 on Charisma CAS 1020 in the UK and Impulse 9295 in the USA (the original UK issue had the 'Pink Scroll' label design and the CD reflects that). The DVD Audio version also has a 'reissues interview from 2007'.<br /><br />Disc 2 (39:36 minutes) is their 3rd album \\"Nursery Cryme\\", originally released on LP in November 1971 on Charisma CAS 1052 in the UK and Charisma 7208 552 in the USA (Pink Scroll Label also). The DVD audio version also has the 'reissues interview from 2007'.<br /><br />Disc 3 (51:20 minutes) is their 4th album \\"Foxtrot\\", originally released on LP in October 1972 on Charisma CAS 1058 in the UK and Charisma 7208 553 in the USA (changes now to the `Mad Hatter' label design for 3, 4 and 5 reflecting the original vinyl). The DVD Audio disc has 3 extras - reissues interview 2007, Brussels, Belgium Rock Of The 70's 1972 clip and Rome, Italy, Piper Club 1972 clip.<br /><br />Disc 4 (53:39 minutes) is their 6th album \\"Selling England By The Pound\\", originally released in October 1973 on Charisma CAS 1074 in the UK and Charisma 7208 554 in the USA. (Their 5th album, \\"Genesis Live\\", was released in July 1973 on Charisma CLASS 1 in the UK; it was an official release and no explanation is given for its no show in this box set).  The DVD Audio version has 3 extras, reissues Interview 2007, Shepperton Studios, Italian TV, 1973 clip and Batacain, France, 1973 clip.<br /><br />Disc 5 (45:38/48:51 minutes) is their 7th album \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\", originally released in November 1974 as a 2LP set on Charisma CGS 101 in the UK and on Atco 7599 122 in the USA. The DVD has all of the slide show that accompanied the stage shows offering both Surround and standard stereo versions.<br /><br />Disc 6 \\"Extra Tracks\\" (46:44 minutes):<br />Track 1 is \\"Happy The Man\\", a non-album 7\\" single issued in the UK on May 1972 on Charisma CB 181 (\\"Seven Stones\\" is its B-side - a track off \\"Nursery Cryme\\")<br />Track 2 is \\"Twilight Alehouse\\", the non-album B-side to \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" issued on 7\\" single in May 1974 on Charisma CB 224<br />Track 3 is \\"Sheppard (BBC Nightride 1970)\\"<br />Track 4 is \\"Pacidy (BBC Nightride 1970)\\"<br />Track 5 is \\"Let Us Now Make Love (BBC Nightride 1970)\\"<br />Track 6 is \\"Going OutTo Get You (Demo 1969)\\"<br />Tracks 7 to 10 are called Genesis Plays Jackson.  Michael Jackson was a painter who put music to a silent film of \\"Metropolis\\" and invited Genesis in to score it. Some tracks were done, but the full project was abandoned. These tapes have only recently come to light and the four tracks are; \\"Provocation\\", \\"Frustration\\", \\"Manipulation\\" and Resignation\\" - \\"Frustration\\" would later turn up as \\"Anyway\\" on \\"Lamb\\" and \\"Manipulation\\" became \\"The Musical Box\\" on \\"Nursery Cryme\\".<br /><br />While the DVD and Audio elements are fantastic and the extras fascinating - I find the packaging naff (typical of all things Virgin). The box lid won't close no matter what you do, the individual booklets are simply the original artwork restored, but again they're too small to read and massively underwhelming compared to the beautiful event feel of the original vinyl gatefold sleeves (especially \\"Lamb\\"). And with no new essay, no new photos, nor nothing of their history - when they're released as stand-alone CDs, fans are going to feel mightily short-changed - again! And why no \\"Live\\" set - nor the 1975 single edit of \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" - or its unique b-side, the live in the USA (Evil Jam) version of \\"The Waiting Room\\"? And then of course is the price - £90! And with the boys now individually credited as Limited Companies on the rear sleeve - the whole thing smacks a little too much of corporate greed instead of musical celebration.<br /><br />Wonderful in some respects and yet strangely disappointing in others, this eagerly awaited box is 4-stars when it should have been six. I can't help but feel that many would be better off waiting for the individual issues.<br /><br />Good then, when it could have been great.l Jackson was a painter who put music to a silent film of \\"Metropolis\\" and invited Genesis in to score it.

And why no \\"Live\\" set - nor the 1975 single edit of \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" - or its unique b-side, the live in the USA (Evil Jam) version of \\"The Waiting Room\\"? And then of course is the price - £90! And with the boys now individually credited as Limited Companies on the rear sleeve - the whole thing smacks a little too much of corporate greed instead of musical celebration.     Wonderful in some respects and yet strangely disappointing in others, this eagerly awaited box is 4-stars when it should have been six. I can't help but feel that many would be better off waiting for the individual issues.     Good then, when it could have been great.
B001ECQ6PG|5.0|I ordered this turntable to transfer recordings from my old 78 records to my computer. It came with a software CD, which [as with any USB turntable] transfers the files from the turntable to the computer and lets you clean up the 'noise.' The CD that came with the turntable did not have the right software for my Mac, but I downloaded the recommended - and free - 'Audacity' software from audacity.sourceforge.net. along with a PDF version of the user manual. If you use a PC rather than a Mac you should not have this problem. Being a novice, it took me a few hours of reading and experimenting to get things working the way I wanted, but I'm completely satisfied with the result. A great USB turntable at a great price.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is by far the best of the best of the Dicken's Christmas Carol productions.  Michael Caine, one of the few human actors/actresses, does an award winning performance, while the muppet characters really add to the production especially to the lighter side.  It is not the same old Christmas Carol performed many times down through the years, but light and airy at places and down right dramatic, tear jerking, and elevating at others.  We have made this a family tradition for many many years. I had the VHS copy originally and then the DVD and finally got this one as a backup.(I loan the one copy out at times) I am not really sure it is a young childrens movie, there are some spots that might be scary to them and definitely areas that they would not understand (heavy drama) and probably boring.  This is not one of your normal muppet movies.     May God bless and keep y'all,  Les
B000HWZ5W4|4.0|I might be so bold as to say that 'Big Log' is one of the best songs of the 20th century.  Within it there is the desperation of existence, of finding and losing love, tranquility, and restlessness, bookended by Plant's lyrics and vocal and the sublime guitar work of Blunt.  It is one of the finer creative efforts I've ever experienced in any medium.  If you are one of those people like me, it's not a pop song, it's a song that reverberates up and down your spine and stays with you, and haunts you a little bit.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Hands down, one of the best superhero movies I seen in the last 10 years.
B001EYGOEM|2.0|Yes she may be a great song writer but can she sing? The jury is still out on that one. Whenever she appears live on TV I have to grab my remote and turn the sound off. Yikes! She is so flat. Obviously recording in a studio can fix a lot of that. Yes she is very pleasant to look at but I believe she is just one example of singers \\"making\\" it today from their looks (so much promotion is visual) but not their voice talent. Give me a break. Where are the truly great singers? If I have to listen to her or even Faith Hill (sing one more Christmas song) I think I will just stay home and listen to my own selection of music.
1416595546|4.0|It's clich&eacute; to write this, but the novel is gripping. I'm a fan of long historical stories (&agrave; la Jakes and Michener), and I think the style of Montefiore's novel is similar: while the major focus remains on a single character, Sashenka, the plot also follows others in her life as time passes. But perhaps what strikes me most in this novel are the details -- It isn't necessarily what is said or unsaid, but *how*. The work abounds in very specific words like \\"landaulet\\" and \\"tuberose\\" -- describing a type of vehicle, and a scent, respectively); there isn't much that the author leaves to the imagination. Before reading this book, I had little notion of what Russia was (or would have been) like before and during the initial Soviet takeover, but Montefiore seems to have the mind of a director when envisioning the settings, costumes, accents, and accessories of his stage.<br /><br />In all, the novel seems like a good candidate for a film adaptation, so I feel pretty good that I read the book first!
B000V674P2|5.0|This is an extraordinary album, and a seminal one for many people getting into blues in the '60's. I have had this in one form or another since the week it originally came out on vinyl in Mono in the US. Interestingly (at least to me) , it is one of the few albums that I prefer in MONO untouched by either the artifice of being made into stereo or the ingenuity of digital re-mastering. Not to say that it is not exemplary in those formats, but the raw power projected by the original Mono release is something else again. However you own it, you'll enjoy it and you'll own a piece of music history.
0784011176|5.0|I love, love, love this movie.  It is my favorite movie of all time.  If you haven't seen it, buy it.  It's kind of a strange, melancholy kind of setting with some unusual twists and turns.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read so far. I haven't gone all the way through it yet, but it's still the best.
B00197POXG|5.0|The set is well organized.  I love how it is diplayed and layed out.  The quality of the DVD's is great.

0312427999|5.0|The elegance of the presentation is matched only by the vicousness of the presented. Rarely does one book change the reality of the reader, or shatter the predispositions of ones opinions. There is much to be said to the importance and timing of such work, but one must wait till the shock wares off to articulate a clear postion. Bravo Naomi Klein. Bravo.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is a truly extraordinary film on every level:  a profound, humanistic, historically meticulous work; stunningly researched; exquisitely filmed; brilliantly acted.  It ranks among the greatest achievements of cinema.  Lenin, according to Gorky, said that he could not continue to listen to Beethoven's \\"Appasionata,\\" because he would stroke the heads that he must crush.  This is a film about a Lenin who hears the music, and, above all, the music  of other people's lives.  It is simply unforgettable.
B001EO2UKO|4.0|This disc features several good songs including \\"don't believe in love \\"quiet times\\" and never want to say it's love, and us two little gods.  Mellow music and easy to listen to.Classic Dido with her sexy voice and nice  orchestral instrumentals.With the chanting choruses that remain consistent throughout each song. Well put together groupings of songs. The melodies are fantastic and familiar to other works in past. Generally speaking, I liked Burin' Love and Northern Skies also. The whole album is very enjoyable basically. I found it to be a good value for the price.
B000006TRV|2.0|Great music!  However, not happy about not being able to load the first disk onto my computer.  Sent the first one back and had the same problem with the replacement.  Disk 2 loads fine.  Now I can't put the first disk on my MP3 player.
1400076943|5.0|The first chapter you think \\"uh oh.\\"  The first sentence starts \\"Things started to fall apart at home . . .\\" Then there is a broken glass &eacute;tag&egrave;re that gets broken by the father's church missal.  She has managed to pack homages to two famous works - the Glass Menagerie and Things Fall Apart - into the first three pages.  In my mind I'm thinking, this could be a terrible book.  But then I was up until 3 in the morning and would have finished the book if not for the fact that I need at least five hours of sleep.<br /><br />The narrator of the work is the quiet fifteen year-old girl, Kambili.  She is coming of age in a distraught Nigeria that has just had another coup. (Perhaps it's the 1993 Abacha coup, but which one is meaningless.)  She is pulled between her overbearing businessman father and her free-spirited professor aunt.<br /><br />Kambili's father schedules the whole day for his children including prayer time and family time.  He rejects his own father because the old man will not convert to Catholicism.  He has the zeal of a convert, yet beats his wife.<br /><br />Aunty Ifeoma on the other hand is a modern woman.  While she is a Christian she accepts her father's paganism or as she calls it \\"traditionalism.\\"  Ifeoma also wants to pull Kambili from her shy shell and into the beautiful active woman she can be.<br /><br />In a larger sense, Kambili is Nigeria, or any African gatekeeper state, torn between those who want to copy the whites and those who want to create a new way forward.  The father's way is the way to get rich with money while the aunt's way is the way to get rich with family and laughter.<br /><br />The question is which way should Kambili go as she grows into a woman; and, which way should Africa go as it throws off the shackles of colonialism.  No more can Africans be \\"like footballs that are kicked which ever way [whites] want.\\"<br /><br />This was a great piece of fiction by the next great Igbo writer.  If this was only Adichie's first novel, I cannot wait to read \\"Half of A Yellow Sun.\\".\\"
1932100660|5.0|This, in my opinion, is the absolute TRUTH about nutrition.  It will blow your mind.  Food-isms that you have believed all  your life will be shattered.  After \\"The China Study,\\" it is  difficult to put another bite of meat, egg, or dairy in your  mouth. Now I am vegan, and will never go back.
B001CUXZT0|5.0|These late 70's Alice Cooper albums are extremely underrated.  Honestly, the last three albums he made in the 70's appeal to me MUCH more than the Welcome to My Nightmare album.<br /><br />Alright, something feels missing from the Lace and Whiskey album, and I think it's a creepy atmosphere along with a hard rock edge to most of the songs.  BUT, you know what?  That doesn't even matter, because the songwriting here is pretty darn good most of the time.<br /><br />The title song has a really good verse  melody and chorus, \\"Road Rats\\" and \\"King of the Silver Screen\\" both COOK with lots of energy and catchy vocals, and \\"Damned If I Do\\" recalls the classic years of stuff like \\"Under My Wheels\\" and \\"Muscle of Love\\".  THESE are probably my favorite kind of Cooper songs- short and snappy hard rock that should catch anyones attention and be considered immediate highlights.<br /><br />\\"You and Me\\" is just beautiful, and the final track called \\"My God\\" reminds me of Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Debbie Denise\\".  \\"(No More) Love at Your Convenience\\" is a nice taste of disco.  Say what you want about it, but Alice knew how to make a good melody out of a disco tune.<br /><br />Overall, I fail to understand why so many people dislike the music.  Talk about excellent songwriting.
B000002MTR|2.0|2 1/2    Perhaps not their absolute worst material (there still seems to be more fire involved on the whole then their extremely competent though mostly lobotomized current work) , but probably the disc with the biggest identity crisis. There are many less-then-funky choices going on here which keep this album from even becoming uniformly good, dragging these sessions down into noisy creative conflict instrumentally at odds with each other.
0743270754|5.0|This is a book of popular biography, meant for a general audience and not specifically for Lincoln scholars (although I have seen Lincoln scholars extol the virtues of this book on C-span).  As a book of popular biography it undoubtedly brings much to light that the general reader probably did not know.<br /><br />The first half of the book deals with the lives of Edward Bates, Salmon Chase and William Seward before they joined Lincoln's cabinet. (The lives of Edwin Stanton and various members of the Blair family are also discussed.)  While biographies have been written about all of these people, it is unlikely that the general audience for whom this book is intended has read them and indeed if many of the people who are well versed on the life of Lincoln have read them either.  As the subtitle of the book states, this book is about the \\"political genius of Abraham Lincoln\\" and as such has a somewhat different (and more specific) slant than most Lincoln biographies.  The second half of the book deals with Lincoln's interactions with the people whose biographies are provided in the first half of the book.  It shows how they were turned from rivals who underestimated, and often denigrated him, to men who came to respect and even love him.
0790740443|5.0|I must say that this is one of my favorite DVDs.  I am a real fan of science fiction movies that have a real plot and show something special about the human experience.  This movie has both in good measure.  The movie shows the transition of a person from machine to protector.  I love a good redemption movie.  If you like empty action, then you might give this movie a pass.  But if you like your action to be seasoned with thought then this is the flick for you.      I just wish they remastered this in Blue Ray.  I'd buy another in a heart beat.
B001EIOOVS|5.0|This movie is great!  The wait was worth it.  It took so long for the Blu-ray release but everything about it is top notch!
B001C08RHA|4.0|The movie was good....not what I usually watch.  My husband watches movies like this all the time and he LOVED it.  It was a good story line though.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is absolutely the best blu ray title available and you get 6 discs for $50 or less.  The video is amazing and will really show you what your TV can do, especially the black levels.  It may not be that amazing, color-popping nature show but it is supposed to replicate wartime footage with a grainy and 'faded color' appearance, and that it does extremely well.  If you watch this with at least a 5.1 sound system prepare to be in for a treat.  Band of Brothers utilized surround sound technology better than any other movie/show I've ever seen and you will here bullets whizzing by and mortars detonating all around you.        I'm not going to go into how great the storyline is because more than likely if you are purchasing this, you've seen it before.  There are also many other reviews that describe just how great this series is.  For around $50 you get almost 10 hours of WW II - you really can't go wrong.  This is my favorite movie/series of all time and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B0013ND30M|5.0|This is one of Disney's Classics and to have it with all the extras is even better! Remember the days of great Disney movies and enjoy Sleeping Beauty
0307394549|4.0|I checked this book out at my local library and made a few cookies before ordering it. (I have too many cookbooks as it is). The recipes and photos are divine! The only complaint I have about this book is that I wish the publisher had included measurements by weight. Most home cooks use volume to measure out ingredients, but those of us who use weight have a hard and tedious time going back to volume. That being said, I want to tell you that the most delicious Palmiers and Chocolate Crackle cookies I have ever eaten, came out of this book. During Christmas I bake LOTS of cookies to give away, and this year I received many compliments on the cookies from this book. So next year I will use some of the same recipes plus a few new ones. Besides the great photos and recipes, the Table of Contents is a pictorial of the 175 cookie recipes. All the cookies are right there, in front of you to choose from without having to peruse the entire book to choose what you are going to bake. This to me is a great time saver. The cookies are divided into the following sections:  Light and Delicate  Soft and Chewy  Crumbly and Sandy  Chunky and Nutty  Cakey and Tender  Crisp and Crunchy  Rich and Dense  Tools and Techniques  Packaging and Giving   Sources  This is a great book to own, but be careful.....those cookies have a way of jumping out of the page, make you bake them, and then insist on following you everywhere by sitting on your hips, thighs, belly, etc. If you are not a cookie monster now, you will be one if you have this book.
0743290119|5.0|A fun book to read, although you can't relate to every character in everyway, but there's something in each of them you find in yourself or maybe your current situation. But overall, an entertaining book to read on a Monday night after work, curled up in your favorite PJs.
B00005JKNF|4.0|This mystery is sort of an upstairs ( ladies and gentlemen)<br />and downstairs ( maids, valets, cooks  and butlers) mixer.<br />A shooting -gathering of the clans brings together<br />and aristocratic family and<br />some American Hollywood invaders.<br />The head of the clan is a merchant and he is murdered.<br />The Lady's maid of the dowager seems to have more idea of the motivations of the crime than the constable and detective of the police.<br />The traditional British empire culture of the 1800's of manners and styles is about to change and we are given a window on why.
B000NOQDOA|4.0|This mount is awesome.  Got it and installed it on my 2008 Accord. My two year old son loves having his cartoons on the go. Only draw backs I would say this product has are the brackets that hold the player in place could be metal like the base and maybe cover them in rubber. The second draw back is only for those thathave real small ones like me in baby seat still. It hangs kinda low and is close to where baby can kick at it, which can be easily resolved by moving seat up a bit.  Overall, Love the product!  Way better than bags with straps all over the place.
B000E41MS6|4.0|The \\"Time Lord\\" is reborn in the modern BBC series.<br />This result is sort of like Dr Who the next generation.<br />It is humorous and interesting: a fun sci fi show that mostly<br />you can let the kids watch too.<br />This set of dvd's is the first season of mayhem<br />and time and space travel in a telephone booth.<br />It certainly beats most American / Hollywood sci fi series of late<br />which seem to have a dreadful dark and vampire type approach.
B000QUT9RY|4.0|These powered monitors fit my needs perfectly.  I use these on my PC as well as with my Behringer V-Amp Pro.  Despite their small size, the output level of these is quite surprising.  The sound output is neutral and well balanced, these are an absolute steal in this price range.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|I didn't expect much from this movie but I am sure glad I watched it. I was a fan of the campy Roger Corman origional and was glad to see that this movie did not disregard the origional. Jason Statham was excellent as he is in just about all his movies. The guy is the action star of NOW. Joan Allen was very good as the menacing and hot MILF warden. The cars, the guns, and the action were all top notch and this movie is one heck of a fun and action packed movie. Oh, and don't forget the hot babes too!<br /><br />If you like good nonstop action and good actors wrapped around it climb in start your engine and hang on!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|This is a great album!  Listening to the first release doesn't give you an idea about the whole album.  This is some of their best music yet!  Way to go Nickleback!
B0002PZVH0|5.0|Easy to listen to. The ULTIMATE trip. Awesome use of space.    I've listened to thousands of recordings over the past 30 years, but this is still in my top 3....the other 2 are \\"Northern Song\\" by Steve Tibbetts and \\"Strata\\" by Robert Rich/Steve Roach.     5,000 stars. Not for dancing!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Easily the best thing to come out of the writer's strike. Great acting singing and laughs are abound in this clever little short. The extras included are the disc are nice but sadly I discovered upon opening my official mutant enemy produced DVD that the disc itself was burned. Yes the back of it was purple and the \\"verbatim\\" dvd-r logo could easily be seen under the disc's label. While I'm sure it will be fine for now. It's a fact that DVD-rs don't last as long as pressed discs. Meaning an eventual double dip will be required.
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|great movie great acting from danial craig and great music by david arnold see this movie you wont be sorry
B001FBSMW6|1.0|Oh what a massive disappointment.  I liked Hopes and Fears.  I loved Under The Iron Sea.  I absolutely despise Perfect Symmetry.  It's a collection of pop trash with weak lyrics and no real energy.  Although, there is obvious individual growth among the members, as a group, they have lost ground.  Such a weak album typically indicates creative differences and, unless something changes, means they won't be together much longer.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This is my most favorite movie and to find the soundtrack was awesome I so love this music!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|While I think the actual production of DHSAB is fabulous and contains all the wonderful bits of good comedy and tragedy along with the bon mots and sweetness that is Joss Whedon and everyone alive should watch and enjoy this production, I have to knock a few points on the DVD.  There are no subtitles for the Commentary! musical which makes it impossible to understand some parts with no lips to watch, let alone deaf peeps.  You can't flip to a single ELE application and the menu flipping is a bit sticky (a common Joss Whedon DVD issue).  The Commentary! won't give you much new material if you know all the stories already (and will be funnier if you do), but is still worth a few hearty laughs.
B001G5ZKZS|3.0|Soy fanático de RUSH desde hace mas de 10 años y este ha sido el peor concierto que he escuchado de ellos, se escuchan MUY LENTOS en todas sus canciones, pensé que era un error al momento de grabar el CD, pero al escuchar el SNAKES & ARROWS en CD de audio confirmé lo que ví en este DVD.  No se porqué han bajado la velocidad y la intensidad de su música, pero realmente se escucha mal y parece que le faltara algo a RUSH, además que sus nuevas canciones malas, nos han acostumbrado a cosas mucho mejores que las que trae el cd nuevo....  Mal DVD para mí, lo recomendaría que lo compraran a las personas que les gusta coleccionar como yo artículos de RUSH, pero por más nada.
B00013RC66|5.0|I love this movie.  It is aptly described as a psychological thriller because that is exactly what it is.  You won't see a lot of fast-paced action and suspense.  The entire film is a slow build up of psychological drama.  You'll find yourself questioning the motives of each different character and watching with intrigue as Debra Winger's character begins to evolve.  The tension between the two female leads is top notch.  And there's a twist ending to top it all off!    It's definitely an 80's movie so the filming isn't always stellar and the storyline is a bit dated (also, for amusement, check out the computers in the FBI office!) Don't expect amazing cinematography or a fabulous soundtrack.  But do expect a brilliant and seductive pyschological dance between two fantastic female leads.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Aside from this being an amazing series, which I watched on HBO, as well as purchased the same DVD box set when it was released; I cannot get this new Blu Ray disc #2 to play.  It keeps coming up as an \\"unrecognized\\" disc in my Sony BDP-BX1 (Costco's S350 equivalent).  I'm an avid firmware updater for just about everything in the house and I am definitely up to date on the Blu Ray player.  All other discs tested fine, but I'm a bit irritated at having paid for a full box set and only being able to utilize 5 of the 6 discs.  I'm willing to bet that if I can even find a customer service contact number for HBO, they're going to want some money for a replacement disc.      Don't get me wrong, this is a 5 star series (by far) but I could only give this product purchase one less star than 5, since I can use 1 less disc than what I paid for.
B001FEA9QU|1.0|For five bucks it's my most skipped Metallica.  If you read my previous review, then know this.  RUN AWAY from this piece of garbage.  Once you cut your balls off, you can't just grow them back.  I recommend Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning.  But, then again, it's only five bucks.  I'll most likely find a track to like.
0553384775|5.0|one of the best books i have read. a great way to show a mans life being at its peak down to its fall. very very funny!
B0018CWEYY|4.0|In my review of Season 3, I wrote that the series had become silly, relying too much on convenient, contrived coincidence to move the plot along, and had lost its sense of adventure.     Season 4 remedies these problems, and also fixes my main gripe with Seasons 1 & 2; namely, that the show didn't advance quickly enough and kept you in suspense for too long... long enough to milk the commercial sponsors, perhaps, but too long for the viewer, whose sense of anticipation dwindled and patience quickly wore thin. It's almost as if the producers finally sat down together for Season 4 and said, \\"Ok, we've got a hit show on our hands, we can't make it last forever, so let's really get down to business\\" and shifted the series into high gear. In my opinion, this the best Season thus far, with Season 2 a very close second.     Many viewers of Season 4 on this site have complained that there isn't enough \\"value\\" in the DVD set on the basis of the fact that there aren't as many episodes as the previous seasons. I can only surmise that for these folks the mere ACT of sitting in front of a television is a source of entertainment... maybe it gives them enough time to polish off an extra bag of potato chips. True, Season 4 deprives them of this. Yet it still manages to produce all the suspense, intrigue, plot development and emotional punch of any of the three previous seasons.     What it does is condense these values, and miraculously, it feels natural, not rushed. I think the reason is that the other seasons were thinly stretched out at the direction of ABC Studios, even though the producers didn't have enough material to justify the duration. Season 4 strips away scenes of our protagonists drawing patterns in the sand with twigs amidst the flickering firelight, set to irrelevant background music, where nothing occurs except blank stares off into the distance, gratifying hugs, pats of appreciation, and protracted vacant glances at the other characters. Why anyone would have a problem with this is beyond me.     Benjamin Linus is by far the most fascinating character of the series, and his presence is even more formidable this season. I miss the balance provided by Charlie's character (he provided relief, not necessarily comic, but relief from the show's intensity in general) and he should never have been cut. I am starting to resent Hurley's presence more and more, and his continued inclusion during key plot sequences is the entire reason why I'm not giving Season 4 five stars. The actor who plays him is incredibly weak, his character is completely uninteresting, and I have a hard time chanelling this triumph over adversity that the producers want me to feel when Hurley's greatest achievements are:  a) tripping over Jacob's cabin, b) belly-flopping into the ocean, and c) sharing half of his candy bar with Benjamin Linus. At least he doesn't have a completely gut-wrenching romance for us to suffer through this season.     Desmond transforms into another pivotal character this season, which is welcome. Kate continues to impress and the actress that plays her is improving to the point of making her character one of the strongest links in the show. The members of the \\"rescue ship\\" are flawlessly cast and I found myself completely impressed with the well-developed and expertly conceived complexity of the dynamic between its crew, the Survivors of Oceanic flight 815, and Benjamin Linus. I am now more confident than ever that Lost knows exactly where it's going, a sense that had almost disappeared by the end of Season 3.     I would say to anyone hitting a rut with previous seasons or episodes of the series that they ought to endure the dry spell, and stick with the series long enough to earn the privelege of watching Season 4. Excellent work ABC.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|This is a cute movie there are a few things in there for the grown-ups.  My son who is 6 loves this movie and has watched it many times. There is just enough things in there for adults that I don't mind seeing over and over. The movie has an some environmental things in there but they are not like happy feet where its the only thing the movie is about and very sad so it is a good movie and the animation is good too.

B000007XUQ|5.0|The biggest reason to buy this is to get on CD the closest thing to the original Christmas Portrait (disc 1). Disc 2 is fine, and has some wonderful interpretations by Karen (notably \\"There's No Place Like Home for the Holidays\\" and \\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\\"), but it has far too much instrumental filler and cannot compete with Disc 1. Disc 1 is a classic, and unlike the \\"deluxe edition\\" of Christmas Portrait keeps the almost perfect sequence of the original Christmas Portrait album. There are no bad or even mediocre songs on this album, and the arrangements are wonderful and perfectly frame Karen's voice. On several classics, Karen outdoes the originals. The smooth line and wistful ache of her voice when she sings \\"hang a shining star upon the highest bough\\" in \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" are miraculous. Her versions of \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"White Christmas\\" are right up there with Nat King Cole's and Bing Crosby's. Lesser known songs like \\"The First Snowfall of the Winter\\" are equally delightful, and of course \\"Merry Christmas Darling\\" is the Carpenters own Christmas classic. Much has been written about the arrangements, and it should be noted that these were Peter Knight's, not Richard Carpenter's.     One gripe: in the original Christmas Portrait, \\"Ave Maria\\" was Karen and piano/orchestra only, and it was gorgeous. In the deluxe version and in this set, a choir is added - completely unnecessary, and takes away from the purity of hearing just Karen and the piano on this loveliest and most serene of songs. It is still my favorite song of the album. This is the one Christmas album I have to listen to every year (this plus the single \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" by Brenda Lee). I listen to a lot of other music, but nothing else is indispensable. There's never been another voice like Karen Carpenter's, and never will be.
B000002OX5|4.0|The Who Sell Out represents the best Who performances but I'd only say that after hearing the additional tracks. The original album is great but the extras make this essential. It also represents the Who at near or around their peak along with Live At Leeds. I'm biased but the first 3 albums are the best. They are energetic, exciting and really good fun.
B001ESYAJY|3.0|The best thing about this soundtrack is that includes the title song \\"Another Way to Die.\\"  For some reason, it's the final track instead of the first but at least it's here--something that can't be said for the CASINO ROYALE soundtrack.<br /><br />Although CASINO ROYALE didn't include \\"You Know My Name,\\" it was a better soundtrack, but that may not be the fault of the composer, for sure.<br /><br />QUANTUM OF SOLACE is the first direct sequel in the 007 series (some might point out that after Blofeld murdered Bond's wife in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE in 1969, Bond hunted Blofeld down and killed him a few times in 1971's DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, dispatching a few doubles before finally blowing him up on an oil rig).<br /><br />As a film, QUANTUM is not nearly as good as CASINO.  The directing and editing are chaotic at best.  The movie goes at such a breakneck pace that it's easy to get lost.<br /><br />But I have the soundtrack to it because I have the soundtracks to all of the Bond films.  It's good, maybe even better than the movie.
B001DPC52C|5.0|I agree with all of the praise in these reviews... but wait until you see/hear the Blu-Ray!!!!!!!  I watched the entire concert and bonus features straight through and was left speechless at the conclusion of the Blu-Ray.  Full 1080p and an uncompressed 5.1 PCM soundtrack will push your equipment to its limits!  This entire project is sensory overload and the Blu-Ray takes it all the way!  Blu-Ray is universal but the accompanying DVD is on PAL format and not payable by most of us in the states.  Buy the CD/DVD from AMAZON until your import order is filled for the Blu-Ray, it is well worth the effort and wait!<br /><br />This is my new system reference disc and will be almost impossible to top in the foreseeable future.  The only way this Blu-Ray could be improved would have been to include an uncompressed 7.1 soundtrack.  I'm not complaining though, the overall content is so amazingly produced and performed that you will be exhausted by the end of the concert.  An incredible purchase.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|This remake of Journey to the Center of the Earth is a pretty good version.  No stellar performances, special effects are good.  The blu-ray is crisp and clean.  The adaptation of 3-D for blu-ray has a few issues though.  It uses an unusual combination of red and green lenses, and the green will often get too dark and you'll find yourself adjusting the glasses to try and get a better view.  I'm not sure if the glasses are what cause the movie to become so devoid of color, but it almost appears to be a black and white film in 3-D.  Though entertaining, some of the 3-D tricks are the oldest in the book, and you almost feel like you've been there - done that.  You WILL appreciate the ability to choose between the 3-D and the standard versions of the film.      Obviously the comparison between this version of Journey to the Center of the Earth and it's original counterpart is going to be like comparing apples and oranges. The technology has progressed so much for this latest version.  You won't need to use your imagination so much now.  I think the newer version of the movie is worth seeing, and definitely does NOT fall under the category of unnecessary remakes.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" is more than a pop culture phenomenon; it is genuinely a great film.  The social implications of extremes such as Batman and The Joker are played out in the battle for Gotham City and Harvey Dent.  Christopher Nolan, along with writers David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan, has crafted a very thoughtful, engaging story chock full of symbolism and nuances.    For such a juggernaut of a film, it is truly disappointing that the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD should be so spartan.  There are only two featurettes.  One is generic, and the other is little more than Hans Zimmer telling you how brilliant his two-note Joker theme is.  Otherwise, all you're getting are six Gotham News segments profiling lead characters (interesting, yes, but hardly a definitive bonus feature), three trailers and production stills.  \\"Batman Begins\\" had a far more satisfying 2-disc release, and one cannot help suspecting that Warner Brothers have a 3-disc edition in the offing for after the Oscars are handed out.
B000HIVOI2|4.0|I wasn't too happy with the quality of the movie as others have said but then again I believe it was filmed in 1994 and wasn't expecting a full 1080p transfer to look that great. And I got this movie for $9.99 which I figure is a few bucks more than the dvd costs right now so it can't hurt. Other than that the movie itself is rather great; I have seen all of SG-1, Atlantis, and the two new Stargate movies but never the original.    The subtitles on the movie are not defective they are just hidden. If you hit your subtitle button a few times I believe track 5 English has the subtitles ONLY for when the aliens talking. The first English track is for subtitles on ALL the time.    I gave this movie 4 stars because I thought they could have done a better job transfering the movie to high-def and they could have figured out that English audio track 1 should have subtitles for the alien language instead of putting it on a separate track... as if any of us speak English AND the alien language to NOT need the subtitles....
0810995522|5.0|\\"Rodrick Rules\\" is a winning and often hilarious account of a year in the life of diary writer, Gregory Henfield.  His accounts of life with a bullying older brother, tattle-tailing little brother, nerdy best friend, and annual life events such as holidays, vacations, and school events are right on target.<br /><br />Kids will love the pictures and easy to follow text. Educators and parents will love that the kids are enjoying reading so much.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|The only drawback of this DVD is the colorized version.  Technicolor was available when this movie was made, but the director and producers chose not to use it.  Maybe there was a reason for that.    Fortunately, the black and white version is here too- the better one.    Here's a thought though.  Why is it that every time a person is presented in something other than a fantasy- as someone who believes himself to be Santa Claus- he's always shown as a mental patient?
B000I0QM0E|1.0|So far, this is the worst quality Blu Ray disc I have seen, which is a shame because this is such a visually stunning film.  The Blu Ray is extremely grainy and details in many shots almost seem to have a smudged look.  Paramount should recall these discs and tranfer the film over again. Don't buy this Blu Ray.
B000V7B90C|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because these CDs show that Brian Johnson couldn't hold up Bon Scott's jock strap.  At least when Bon sang, you could understand the lyrics unlike the screeching cat sound out of Brian.  May Bon rest in peace.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Jennifer Hudson offers a one-of-a-kind album with hit after hit, giving up a blend of \\"old school\\" R & B with a new solid, fashionable sound.  Her range and pitch are impeccable.  Her delivery seems instinctive, effortless.       I've heard it said her voice is \\"too strong\\" and some people in the business feared the public would not respond.  But listen to that strong voice and you're drawn to this undercurrent of gentle womanliness I believe will remain a trademark characteristic we will enjoy throughout her career.

0316042994|4.0|Often considered Waugh's 'magnum opus,' this novel of epic proportions follows the conflicted Charles Ryder through his involvement with the enchanting Flyte family. After befriending Sebastian Flyte at Oxford, Charles is gradually introduced to his sisters, Julia and Cordelia; his stolid brother, Brideshead; his estranged father, Lord Marchmain; his pious mother, Lady Marchmain; and, most importantly, Brideshead, their grand estate. Over the course of the story, Charles faces varying degrees of propinquity to each member of the family as he becomes a member of the family himself. Through these relationships, he is forced to make choices concerning love, his future, and religion.     Almost a character within itself, the topic of religion is constant throughout the novel. The Flyte family's Catholicism, we come to find, is of differing importance to each family member. Charles, however, never quite comes to terms with it, resulting in an inveterate rift between the family and him.     I only assign four stars to the novel due to its prolonged nature, even at points of the story that have no consequence to Charles' self-discovery, most particularly the scene in which Charles and Sebastian are thrown in jail.

1416575464|5.0|I love this book for various reasons:<br /><br />1) Well structured - starts off with a \\"how to get started\\", followed by one chapter for each key room in the house, concludes with guides on resources<br />2) Each section boils down certain aspect to general terms that are very helpful with your own designs (e.g. shapes of sofas)<br />3) Great photos<br />4) Different styles covered in each section<br /><br />I disagree with a previous reviewer who states that this is only for young people in their 20's - it may not be a book for someone who likes very traditional designs but I would not put any age restriction on it. If you like to have a bit of fun with your designs you will like this book.<br /><br />One thing I want to make sure that you understand before you buy this book - this is not a shopping guide that gives you details on where to buy particular pieces which you might expect when you are a subscriber to Domino magazine. So you get ideas from this book but will have to do your own research where to find the pieces that fit your budget (which is half of the fun of it - don't you think!)<br /><br />This book will get your creative juices flowing and if that is what you are looking for, I highly recommend it as a staple for your own library and as a go-to-gift.
B001F290E4|5.0|Seal has created a great album with fantastic interpretations of great classics. He has, yet again, showed his musical capability and talent.  With his \\"sand paper\\" voice and unique sound he has created some of the best versions of these classics and in some cases comparable with the originals themselves. The originals are and will remain true classics, greats by themselves and unsurpassed by cover versions but Seal brings something different to the tunes and adds his own twist to the music. Take \\"I can't stand the rain\\" or \\"If you don't know me by now\\", two songs that must be some of the most repeated songs by hundreds of artists throughout the years, are great versions and will go down in history as some of the best covers. Seal isn't competing against the originals, he is interpreting and adding his own soul to the music. The challenge challenge, rather, is against all those other covers out there and here he clearly shines.

B001DVBZ4K|1.0|As with the disappointment shown by other customer's submissions, I too ordered this \\"Horton Hears a Who\\" set when there were no reviews to consult. The fact that the set claims to have an audio CD is a fallacy, and the CD and the plush toy were the selling points. The enclosed plush toy hardly qualifies as a plush toy but at least it's here. The CD is not included and that is false advertising on Amazon's behalf. I too am moderately disappointed with this set because I did not get what I paid for.

B00127R7JM|5.0|I think the reviewer \\"Corneille\\" did a really good job at describing these songs so I won't add too much.The whole cd is great and to me it sounds like a black metal verison of Dream Theater.It starts out the the earth-shaking blast-beats of \\"misanthrope' and the middle eastern riff on \\"scarab\\".During scarab the album shifts tempos to a more progessive feel and this contiues to the end of the album.\\"threnody\\" remaims me of the judas priest song \\"epitah\\" off of sad wings of desinty.I don't think you have to be a black metal fan to enjoy this album.In fact this is one of the best albums of 2008.However after both metal edge and metal manics release their top cd's of 2008 and it was found on neither ,I will have to make it the most underated album of the year.
B00127RAJY|4.0|i just got started with this dvd. I really enjoy the fact it is only 20 minutes. Like everyone else, I need to get in shape and lose weight. I use this dvd everyday, and feel great after. I would recommend this dvd for someone that's trying to get motivated to get up and do something. Also combine this with healthy eating and the results will start. I do cheat with fried food, but not much. This dvd makes me get up, its only 20 minutes, but a GOOD 20 minutes.
0142001104|4.0|Always one to look for a good read, I picked up this book after hearing it recommended by a radio talk show host.  When I first started it I expected it to be spiritualistic positive-thinking fluff.  But this book turns out to offer very practical methods for changing one's perceptions in a way that opens one to more of the possibilities in life.  Seeing the potential in others, not taking oneself too seriously, recognizing one's own ability to contribute to a situation -- these are just a few ways the authors present to experience a more fulfilled and passionate life.  Their writing style is eloquent, elegant, and creative, much like a piece of beautiful music itself.    The transformational \\"practices\\" explained in the book seem to purposely exclude any kind of moral or ethical values or judgments.  Since morality is foundational to my own worldview, I found the book unhelpful in that respect, yet still very relevant and engaging otherwise.    This is a unique book, one of the most interesting I've ever read in the categories of motivation, inspiration, or leadership.

B000002UAI|4.0|Though they wrote and recorded some of the most beloved rock and pop song originals in the history of rock `n' roll, the Beatles were also a splendid cover band that let it all hang out onstage and off. Before the psychedelic, more polished days of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" the easy acoustic breeze of \\"Rubber Soul\\" and all-out experimentation of \\"The White Album,\\" the Fab Four were a raw-rocking, speed-taking, leather-jacket-wearing, loutish bunch who cut their chops in and around Liverpool, all across barren England and in the cesspool of Hamburg, Germany, occasionally axing band members along the way and eventually reaching stardom. Though \\"Beatles for Sale\\" is not the beginning of it all, the album is a fine representation of what this group was about from the outset.<br /><br />For starters, these guys loved American rock `n' roll, and it's evident on this record. On the perky \\"Honey Don't\\" by Carl Perkins, for example, Ringo Starr's assured vocals sound as American as apple pie, and his commands of \\"rock on, George\\" and \\"rock on, George, for Ringo one time\\" give the song a gleeful spontaneousness that is pure levity. Elsewhere, John Lennon's passionate, raging vocals on Chuck Berry's \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" are simply on fire, while the lively piano, drums and bass that surround him are as equally rocking and fun. Other rousing covers include the short medley of \\"Kansas City\\" and \\"Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey,\\" sung like a seasoned pro by the soulful Paul McCartney and enhanced halfway through by George Harrison's precise guitar licks. Another rollicking number is the closing track -- sung with true American soul by Lennon -- Perkins' \\"Everybody's Trying to be My Baby.\\" If ever there were songs to get the joint jumpin' on a Saturday night, these ones would be it.<br /><br />As for the Lennon/McCartney compositions, they don't disappoint, though they are lighter fare compared to the fiery cover tunes. But what these songs lack in an all-out rocking sound, they make up for with genuine writing ability. Tunes like \\"No Reply,\\" \\"I'm a Loser,\\" \\"I'll Follow the Sun,\\" \\"Eight Days a Week,\\" \\"Every Little Thing,\\" \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" fully display all the finest attributes of the duos' budding songwriting partnership: sublime vocals in full-flowered harmony together; beautiful melodies often interspersed with subtle exoticism; self-deprecating lyrics about the pitfalls of love; rugged harmonica, fluid bass work and on-the-spot guitar work. That essential Beatles stuff is all here, ripe to enjoy.<br /><br />Amid all the fervent rockers and tuneful originals, two songs on \\"Beatles for Sale\\" disappoint slightly. \\"Baby's in Black\\" (Lennon/McCartney) and \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" (Roy Lee Johnson) are a tad plodding, and surprisingly, the vocals a bit grating. Otherwise, anyone looking to discover the Beatles' early magic would do well to start with this gem of an album.ith genuine writing ability.

1594481717|4.0|I am italian and i read this book in summer 2007. There is no italian edition for this book so I read it in English. And by reading the book, and reading it in english, I understood something quite interesting:     I came to the conclusion that I read faster English books than Italians.  I have also realized that when you read a foreign language the Right emisphere is much more involved because even if you don't know some specific words, you give much more importance to the context and to what the author is meaning. It' s bad when I miss a word in Italian and i feel the need to go back and read exactly every words in the period. That' s never happens when I read English. It would  be a good example on the two emisphers' complementary.    For sure, one of the best book I have ever read!   Grazie Dan!  nik

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|This movie was a little overrated but still delivers. Heath did a GREAT joker. Really disturbing at times. Sometimes a little too disturbing. But He did a fanstastic job in one of his final roles. RIP. Bale as Batman just doesn't work for me. I don't get that weird dark voice he does as Batman. It's just kinda strange sounding and funny. The movie was about an hour too long. I kept looking at the clock wondering when it was going to end. I just didn't see this as a masterpiece like everyone built it up to be. This is another world of improvement from Batman & Robin. It's a good movie. Just I don't think I would want to ever watch it again. It's kinda like Titanic. Once you've see it, that's enough.

B001KO8AQ6|4.0|The best tracks are good songs.  I would give them a B+, until I listen to \\"Hunter\\" or \\"White Flag\\" or some of her really good older stuff.  Then, these best tracks slip to C or C-.  Still good and, at times, quite interesting, but not as good as her earlier work.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|I expected a better movie from her and was disappointed.  Her first Lara Croft movie was very good, the second, so-so.  Some of her other movies are quite good and she needs to concentrate on them rather than the comic book stuff as in this movie.  She must be an Elvis fan as I think she curls her lip more than he did.  In this movie...Jolie has left the building.

The Warden wants him to race in a prison game. If you win 5 times, you go free, but the Warden tries to make it difficult for him. The guards build a huge truck stocked with guns and try to kill the racers. If you love action, you'll love DEATH RACE!!!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|If you have some spare time and haven't anything else to do...watch this movie.  I would put it ahead of watching anyother mindless forms of entertainment.  It doesn't ask for your approval and takes itself completely serious without regard to the idiocy it strictly adheres to.  From time to time, everyone needs to watch a movie like this, not because of good taste of course, and not so you can tell your friends you watched/bought it, but to establish yourself (for a brief period of time) as a kid who enjoys crap.

0743246616|3.0|After visiting the Magnolia Bakery, I had become a bit obsessed with cupcakes and the story behind the bakeries success so when I found this book I was really excited.  There are so many great recipes in this book, although being from Australia myself, I hadn't heard of a lot of them.....can't wait to try them though!  The only thing that lets this book down is the lack of photographs.  Due to me not knowing what a lot of the recipes were, I would've liked to see what they look like, or are meant to look like.  Other than that, it's a great book with heaps of recipes.  Definitely worth making space for in your bookcase!

B00005RHGL|5.0|I was introduced to this money several years ago and I NEVER get tired of watching it. I`ve watched Wyatt Earp too, but after watching Tombstone,it just doesn`t hold a candle to it. We already had the tape of it,but really wanted the DVD, so I actually got the movie for my husband for his b-day,but I love it just as much. Val Kilmer`s performance in this movie, in my opinion,is one of his best that I`ve ever seen. I like Kurt Russell in about everything I`ve seen him in. Bill Paxton,Sam Elliott, Powers Booth, too many others to mention give a good performance in their rolls to complement the main characters. This may not be the best western ever made,but it`s one of my favorites and I give it two thumbs up!Definitely a cult classic.
B001FB55LM|1.0|This is a really mediocre film.  I didn't think the trailer was very funny and the movie is even worse.  If you want a Jim Carrey laugh fest then go rent his old stuff:  Ace Ventura, The Mask, Dumb & Dumber, Liar Liar, Me Myself and Irene.  All of those films have laugh out loud moments.    This is just awful.  Walking out I asked my family \\"Can you remember anything funny in the movie we just saw?\\"  We were all at a loss to think of anything beyond a slight chuckle (compare that to something like \\"Borat\\" where I nearly choked to death laughing, with tears streaming down my face).    At multiple points today in the theatre I thought \\"I'll walk out if anyone else with me mentions the idea\\".  If you watch it on cable some day, I'm sure during the commercial breaks you'll forget what movie you're watching.  It's that bad.  No one in it and none of the characters are memorable in any way, shape or form.  Carrey's 2 friends have no purpose, and Carrey's boss as a nice guy makes no sense at all.  Then you've got Carrey, nice guy, playing off another nice guy...it's just pointless!  Why not make his boss some ruthless a-hole?  Then we'd at least have some conflict in this boring, boring film.    The love story is by the numbers and it's really a lot worse than the sub-par films Adam Sandler has been putting out lately.  I would say \\"Click\\", for example, was much better than this...and I would only say Click is passable entertainment.    But this just plain sucks.    You've been warned!

1400082773|4.0|This was a good way to get to know what influenced our next President. Written long before he had any idea of going into politics so it had no hidden agenda. This helped to refute some false claims during the campaign and confirm some that he would like to have made go away. No matter what your party preference this is very informative. This should be on every high school Social Studies teacher's reading list after the inauguration to get kids interested in taking part of the democratic process while they are still acutely aware that our nation has taken another important step.

0956010903|3.0|I haven't had the same production problems that some others have.  I'm very impressed with the look of the book, particularly the large faux leather volume the smaller book comes in.  I'm NOT impressed with the editing, however.  There's a typo towards the end of the book, and twice earlier, the same word is printed twice in succession.  Not that big a deal, I know, but at $100. a pop, one doesn't expect any such mistakes.  I'm not objecting to the price, as all the money has gone to a very worthy cause, but I think Amazon had an obligation to make sure that the printing was perfect...and it's not.<br /><br />All that said, the content itself is a delight, highlighting Rowling's deliciously wry sense of humor.  I particularly love Dumbledore's commentaries on the Tales, and the accompanying footnotes.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy that I got this Collector's Edition of \\"Beedle the Bard,\\" it's a lovely keepsake; I just wish Amazon had done a slightly better job in putting it together.

As a long time Whedon fan, Joss does great work, and shows great writing may be hereditary by such a great job done by his brothers Zack and Jed.  I saw it when it went up live, I bought it on iTunes, and now I bought the DVD.  The acting and singing are top notch, with NPH as the budding supervillian, Nathan Fillion as the smarmy narcissistic superhero Captain Hammer, and Felicia Day as the love of my.. I mean... as Penny, the love interest of the piece.  Their performance really makes you feel the full range of human emotion.  Several other Whedon alums make cameos and is a must have for any fan of anyone involved in the project, and a should have for anyone who isn't.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|Casino Royale is an excellent movie, especially on Blu-ray, and Sony has done an amazing job at making a near perfect disc.  In my personal opinion the movie plays a little long towards the end, so that's what I gave it a 4 out of 5, and not a perfect score.<br /><br />Danial Craig is amazing as a younger Bond who is just starting off his career and hasn't had the time or experience to mold him into the suave/sophisticated James Bond as of yet.  This lends to much more action in the new movies, with far less gadgets and Judo chops :)
B00104W8T6|5.0|My kids & I love the very unique music.  Now, I am going to buy the movie.  :)

0292701934|5.0|This is a beautiful book and easily a perfect introduction to Avedon's portraits.  Our granddaughter is very interested in photography and this book explains a little about the process as well as highlighting Avedon's work.  Very enjoyable book!
B000002UJQ|2.0|I loved, LOVED!, \\"Bends\\".  I played it so much in the late 90's, my friends got sick of it and told me to stop playing it.  I fell out of society for a while, and here I am catching up, 10-12 years later (long story).  So, I figured I'd catch up with Radiohead.  I'm listening to \\"OK,Computer\\" as I write this, and, honestly, wtf?  It's gotten such great reviews.  What am I missing? Sorry, but it seems like a mediocre album to me, one or two good songs (I really like \\"Karma Police\\"), but nothing like \\"Bends\\" (maybe nostalgia?, but this doesn't do anything for me).
B001CTA1S4|5.0|\\"Doubt,\\" says Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) during one of his sermons, \\"can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty.\\" For all intents and purposes, he was speaking directly to the audience watching \\"Doubt,\\" a film adaptation of John Patrick Shanley's play. Here's a film that doesn't impose a belief so much as it encourages thought. It's an absorbing character study with the structure of a mystery and the subtext of a morality play, which is to say that the blending of genres makes for a fascinating story. So do the characters, each so thoroughly developed that they never once felt like shallow stereotypes. I felt as if I could listen to them talk for hours, which really must give you an idea how engrossing their dialogue is; Shanley reveals his characters more with the careful, deliberate usage of words than with actions. Some may find that boring. I found it masterful.    Taking place in 1964, \\"Doubt\\" tells the story of a nun who suspects a priest of abusing a teenage boy at a New York City Catholic school. The nun is Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), the school's principal. She's a stern, unsympathetic, conservative woman with a keen eye for misconduct. Some would say it's too keen; there's a sense that she actively looks for something to discipline, be it a student not sitting up straight, the obvious pagan undertones to \\"Frosty the Snowman,\\" the undignified usage of ballpoint pens, or teachers with an innocent outlook on life. Such a teacher is Sister James (Amy Adams), the school's eighth grade teacher; despite a relatively pleasant disposition, she's also somewhat reserved, afraid to provoke Sister Aloysius by not living up to her standards. Consider this moment when all the Sisters eat their dinners in silence--when Sister James takes a bit of food out of her mouth and puts it on the side of her plate, Sister Aloysius gives her a piercing stare, one that says, \\"Not in my school, you don't.\\"    Early on, she tells Sister James to be watchful of Father Flynn, who teaches boys' Basketball. It seems he's been spending a lot of time with Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II), an alter boy who happens to be the school's only black student. Sister James tells Sister Aloysius about the day he went into the school's rectory alone with Father Flynn; when he came back, his expression was troubling, and worse yet, there was alcohol on his breath. \\"So it's happened,\\" says Sister Aloysius as if she knew it would happen all along. Thus begins an intense battle of wills, pitting a nun who has nothing but her certainty against a priest who maintains his innocence.    The genius of this movie is that tackles religious and authority issues without getting preachy. We're shown only what needs to be shown, and from that, we're asked to make up our own minds. As in any good debate, both sides have their good points and their bad points. Take Father Flynn; he does seem to care about young Donald Miller, a young man who has made no friends and wants the security and guidance of an adult male figure. At the same time, there's a sense that maybe Father Flynn is taking too much of an interest in him and not enough of an interest in other boys. There are many possible reasons for this. It could be as simple as the boy's skin color--because Donald is the only black student, Father Flynn is compelled to give him just a little more attention than his white classmates. Or maybe he pities Donald for being abused by his father, which, for some, would explain the odd expression noticed by Sister James.    Now, take Sister Aloysius. One could argue that she's the product of a very different set of values, having been conditioned to believe that teachers are enforcers, not nurturers, and that modern-day conveniences--a handheld transistor radio, for example--hinder a child's ethical development. And after years of seeing priests come and go, it's fair to say that she knows a thing or two about people. That being said, accusing a priestof abuse without proof is serious, perhaps even unwarranted. Sister James believes this to be true. She also has trouble accepting the idea she should look at people with suspicion. \\"It feels as if I'm less close to God,\\" she pleads. \\"When you take a step to address wrongdoing,\\" Sister Aloysius replies matter-of-factly, \\"you are taking a step away from God, but in His service.\\" One wonders: Did Torquemada tell himself the same thing?    The film's most pivotal scene features a conversation between Sister Aloysius and Donald's mother (Viola Davis), who fears her son's expulsion so strongly that she seems willing to let anything happen to him. \\"It's just until June,\\" she keeps saying, knowing that graduating from this school will mean access to a better high school. Sister Aloysius is at a loss to understand Mrs. Miller's line of thinking, although I suspect it has less to do with Donald's welfare and more to do with punishing Father Flynn. The emotions running through this scene are raw and intense, a perfect counterpart to the escalating tensions within the walls of the school. They eventually channel themselves to the film's inevitable climax and make it powerful, which is amazing given the fact that, for some, certainty can't be guaranteed. I left the theater feeling no surer than I did entering, which is a testament to the brilliance of Shanley's writing and direction. \\"Doubt\\" is an absolute masterpiece, not merely as a story, but as a thought-provoking examination of human behavior.
B0006J28L4|5.0|I would show this film in any history class if I taught history. Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X was, is and will always be stunning. It speaks volumes about the most misunderstood aspects in American History. Its an important film that no one should miss. I cannot wait until Blu-ray.
B000002G87|5.0|What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said by most of the reviewers here?  This is a stone-cold, front-to-back masterpiece, easily in my Top 10 Desert Island Discs.  Combining Clapton and Duane Allman, both at the absolute peak of their abilities and teaming them with a phenomenally tight and soulful group of musicians produced this staple of classic rock.     The sad thing is, a lot of casual listeners don't know anything of this album past \\"Layla\\" and \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\".  I was one of these until I got the album in my 'free' CDs from BMG about 13 years ago.  I was completely floored at the stunning passion in this music.  They ease you in with the mellow shuffle of \\"I Looked Away\\" before the passionate, gut-wrenching \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" - \\"Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?!  Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?!\\" Clapton howls in a fit of unrequited love.  Brilliant.  Up next is one of my favorite tracks on the record, \\"Keep On Growing\\", a rollicking, up-tempo, shuffling stomper with a fantastic shared lead vocal between Clapton and Bobby Whitlock punctuated by Clapton and Allman's fiery dueling solos.  6:22 passes like 10 seconds when you are bathed in this orgy of fiery guitars.  Amazing.  In fact, Clapton and Whitlock team up on several of the albums best tracks, including the absolutely blazing \\"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad?\\" and the pleading urgency of \\"Anyday\\".  \\"Key To The Highway\\" is an old blues standard covered by just about everyone under the sun, but the version here may be the best of all time, with the band locked into a barrel-tight yet still relaxed groove while Allman and Clapton push each other to the max, trading licks and solos, almost silently daring each other to top the last.  Their emotional reading of Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\" FAR outshines Jimi's original.  (Sorry Hendrix fans, but it's true._  The only version I've heard that comes close to this is Stevie Ray Vaughan's haunting instrumental take on it.  Another blues chestnut, \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\", conveys the theme of this album (Clapton's secret passion for George Harrison's wife, Patti) as well as any of the original tracks.  You can hear the pain in Eric's voice as he tears through the lines - \\"Have you ever loved a woman, so much you tremble in pain?  All the time you know, she bears another man's name...\\"  Clapton's soloing on this track is fiery, dirty, raw, and nasty.  This isn't all the tunes here ( I didn't even mention the title track, as everyone is familiar by now...)    Bottom line - rock fans, blues fans, Clapton fans, Allman fans, GUITAR fans.  BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True blood will not disappoint! I started watching the show but hadn't read any of the Sookie books. Then, when the show ended I was so distraught of having to wait all the way until Summer 2009 (geez!) to find out what happens next that I ordered the books and read them all in a week. Granted the books and show are not identical they are each equally great. I could see how book lovers would be slightly disappointed since it does veer off in its own interesting way but overall this show is addictive and will keep you wanting more. The casting and acting is top notch and of course so is Alan Ball. So glad that HBO will continue to Season 2 and hope they don't leave us high and dry like they did in Carnivàle and Rome.
0738702994|5.0|This is a beautiful watercolor deck that reflects the Wesh Tradition. The Majors look more finished then the Minors, which feels very appropraite.
0060005696|4.0|After reading this book, it really does bring home the point that having more stuff to choose from does not necessarily make for a better life.  Sometimes it is just one big hassle to have to choose among a bunch of choices, most of which are just variations of other choices.  With the current economic downturn, maybe it is time to reaccess this over the top situation.  People will find that there really is a whole lot more important than 35 kinds of laundry detergent on the shelf at the local grocer. Especially when it will come down to IF there is enough money to pay the bills, buy food, etc, and not merely what brand of food to buy.  The adjustment of attitude will be a good thing in the long run, as most Americans are a spoiled, pampered lot, and tend to get bent out of shape over inconsequential matters.
055358894X|3.0|This book promises the scope and scale of an epic fantasy, but without the epic.     It is about a human population in some distant realm. The characters are well drawn. There is suspense and good plotting, (although, it seemed to drag in places). Locke Lamore is an intriguing rogue, but never do we really see this character confront a really terrible, cataclysmic situation.     The whole tension between Gentlemen Bastards (Lamore's group) and the lead up to the final fight left me wanting something more. Unfortunately, this book doesn't provide it.
B001N26GFC|2.0|Riding off into a very slow start, this movie patters along for the most part until about the last quarter of the film when it picks up pace and the dynamic between the characters really escalates. Sally Hawkins portrayal is noteworthy but the character is slap-worthy until the very end rather than lovable. The movie ends a minute too long - had it ended a few frames before it does, it would've made a posh statement, a statement that resembles the rest of the movie, instead of falling into the romantic comedy trap of our times.
1416585710|2.0|Being a hard-core fan of Stephen King, I found this offering to be less than exciting. Yes, it had some high points but, for the most part, it dragged. The story could have been told in many fewer pages without sacrificing a thing.
B001G5ZKZS|4.0|Wow - what can one say about the overall quality of this dvd?  The picture and sound are top notch.  The band really is tight and they are the best.  Nice job Rush.  You all are really first class.  I saw them back in April in Austin, Texas.  It was the best concert that I have ever been to and I have been to over 50+ concerts in my 38 yrs.
0810979772|5.0|I think it's a very good book. Jeff kinny is a GREAT writer. If your are thinking about buying this, you should buy it. it's a great time-killer,too!
B001N4RORE|5.0|Having never been to an ABBA concert or owned a record or seen the play, I love this film.  It is good natured enjoyment.  There is enough naughtiness to keep it from being bland.  Sure most of the singing is more about acting then voice.  This is fantasy after all.  Meryl Streep is just wonderful as always.  I keep going back to the word fun.  It's hard to see this film without smiling.  That is what this is all about.  The extras are outstanding.  Get some friends together,  have a drink and sing along.

0446402389|3.0|Please read other reviews for a synopsis of the story.  The first third of Child 44 is an extremely engaging read that graphically depicts the psychological torment of life in late Stalinist Russia.  Mistrust is the common currency of virtually any social interaction including the intimacies of family and friends.  Whether Tom Rob Smith's descriptive powers are more the result of an extremely fertile imagination or thorough research, this reader was quickly drawn into that frightening totalitarian world so grimly portrayed. The novel unfortunately becomes increasingly concerned with the suddenly enlightened and obsessed hero's quest to win over his estranged wife while finding the serial killer who is the author of countless murders of young children. The implausiblity of the story and of much of the action increases exponentially as Leo's search heads towards its climax.  What had initially kept me up past my bedtime with excitement and anticipation became, if not a chore, an obligation worth seeing through to its less than satisfactory end.
B001B67VR2|2.0|There is no doubt about the few artists that have had so much overexposure, that there has been not just a lack of heart, but also a lack of appeal to all ages. When it has came down to it this past year, that has sadly been the extreme case with Rihanna. She has had so many videos that have been played at once, that there has been so many lacking souls, and not even enough substance. After last year when A Good Girl Gone Bad was released, there was just so much exposure we've heard from the Umbrella, that it is hard to believe that she would push the exposure too much, too soon. That has been the case one year later with a quick expansion, and even more lagging down.<br /><br />Rihanna's A Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded tries to expand the appeal she had shown from the 2007 album, but instead it feels like a big paperweight just dragging down to drain. The newer tracks not only lag only chemistry, but also drag down what Rihanna had shown so a misled happenstance. While you do get the same songs as before like Umbrella, her collaboration with Ne-Yo on Hate That I Love You and her sampling of Michael Jackson's Wanna Be Startin' Something on Please Don't Stop The Music, but the extra songs don't match what could've been the heart and soul of a ingenue'. The extra songs like Disturbia, and a madeup collaboration with Maroon 5 on If I Never See Your Face Again, drag down the soul of the album, and could've made some stronger ground.<br /><br />All in all, Rihanna has sadly made some lackluster songs the past few years, I wasn't really impressed heart and soul on what honestly could've been more. A Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded doesn't really feel like it is worth the money, and misses so much by the appeal of R&B. I hope she can find better songs than what has been displayed under this umbrella.<br /><br />Songs: D<br /><br />Price: C-<br /><br />Remastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: D+
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Joss Whedon is on top of his game again. The creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer comes through in fine form. Dr. Horrible is a fantastic, fun ride. The actors are top notch and the story is very well crafted. This one is going to be hard to top.
0345444051|4.0|Having read both the original opening chapter and the 1990 opening chapter, I can appreciate the updates that Arthur C. Clarke put into this often underappreciated work.  Known best for the 2001 Series and its parallel movies, Clarke is among the elite science fiction writers.  It is remarkable to reflect on the acccurate visions of the future such writers presented in their writing.  Clarke hits the conscience of mankind with marksman like accuracy in \\"Childhood's End\\".  Yet even with the stunning achievements of this book, the climax seemed a bit far out.    \\"Childhood's End\\" sees the end of the human race's childhood as an alien race arrives on Earth to guide humans to the next phase of evolution.  While that phase may be hard to grasp, the themes in the process of the change are not.  Along the journey, readers observe themes such as cruelty to animals, man's inability to live in a utopian society, the idea of a greater purpose than life on this Earth, and the apocalyptic idea of the last man on Earth.    Though humans come to embrace their alien overloads who save them from themselves, a mysterious set of events gives hints as to the aliens' motives.  While the mystery unravels, Jan Rodricks escapes to visit the home planet of the Overlords.  As he learns of the Overlords' planet, Earth is in its final stages and will not be the same when he returns.    \\"Childhood's End\\" progressed in such a way as to make the reader want to know the next phase and the story's conclusion.  I found the final phase to be somewhat of a reach, though this did not take away from my enjoyment of the story.  Clarke's insight into man and the glimpse into something greater speaks volumes of his skill as a writer.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|This is the Batman movie I like the most. So real, like the Spiderman ones which for a moment or two you feel worry for his personal problems and fear for his safey that the hero \\"may\\" die. So noble, that Batman and his comrades resolved to law and justice despite the loss of love and power. However, I cant help but ask the following question, \\"Can there be someone on Earth with this absolute self control and faith not to make things right with their own hands whilst facing such big evil (and risk)!\\" No matter what, this movie is both philosophical and entertaining. Recommended!
1400082773|5.0|I can hardly believe that Barack Obama wrote this book when he was in his early 30s, just out of law school.  At 73 years old, I have seen a lot of the world, had a life long experience and made a more than 60 years study of the world's great literature and histories.  Barack Obama developed knowledge and insights during his 33 years that could be favorably  compared to those of another mythical 33 year old who was supposedly born in a manger 2008 years ago.  This book, in my opinion, is distained to become a classic of the world's literature, and if he becomes the great president that I think he is capable of becoming, he will be seen by future generations as a combination of Washington, Gandhi and Jefferson.    I am in love with Barack Obama, and I have never met the man.    Now if he could just stop smoking...
B000002KOG|5.0|I am a Neil Young fan and enjoy most everything he has put out. This album, like it's cover suggests, is a sort of dreamy, psychadelic sounding album with lyrics suggesting a pull between the country life and the city life. If you like Neil and have overlooked this album get it now. My favorites are \\"The Loner\\", \\"Here we are in the Years\\", and \\"The Last Trip to Tulsa\\". The whole album flows together into a cohesive whole and all the songs are excellent. Highly recommended!!
B00064AM6C|4.0|The performance was supercharged, wild, psychotic and amazing at the same time. Jack is very drunk (at least i think) and he is commiting a murder of his guitar in front a lot of people. I wish I could've at least stood outside for this one, two people can make a whole lot of noise in one setting. I only gave this 4 stars because I wish they could've at least finished one song, just one and I would've gave it a 5. This is definitely something you should buy if you love them, but not if you're just getting into them, you may not be at the time in your muscial life when you can appreciate it for what it really is. If you like this then you'll probably like the concert DVD the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have out. Thier also a garage band and they make some wild music. BuY This! I got it on Ebay for 24 dollars.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I am going to keep it short since other reviews are very detailed.  If you liked Saving Private Ryan, you will love this.  In fact, if you liked any war movies in the past, you will love this series.  Buy it and enjoy the epic war story that can only be told with 10+ hours of films.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|When I inserted the disc into the player I actually closed my eyes and hoped this film was not going to be another stereotyped, all about sex, gay film. I was not disappointed. From the cast, to location, to the soundtrack, Shelter is a very well made film. If you are even slightly intrigued by this film, watch it.
B000001ELR|3.0|I'm a fan of everything till Love Gun. I'm also a big fan of The Elder. I will admit that this album is quite heavy though the glossy production doesn't serve it too well. My idea of heavy is muddy Sabbath like production, not pop Pyromania like production. I liked the Jigoku treatment given to I love it loud.    It's not my idea of a real memorable Kiss album, but it's got quite a few good tunes. Keep me coming is my favourite.
1846467640|5.0|Definately a must have for the beginning reader!  If your child is as crazy about Peppa as my 3 year old is, then this little set is just for them.  Great to take in the car, on travel, of for a little read any time of day.  An excellent companion to the Peppa Pig \\"Muddy Puddles\\" DVD.
B001IZZEEI|5.0|Everything the other reviewers say is 100% correct! I was extremely impressed with this when I first opened it. The outer shell is like a wedding guest book. The books inside are hard cover, and thick pages, similar to childrens books was my first thought. This is a really great set! I loved the special features discs!
B001F290E4|5.0|Seal can sing ANY song and make it his own, he is such a passionate artist that his passion comes through in every song.    This CD is Seal doing his thing once again! At first I was a little disappointed that none of the tracks were original works of his, but he put such a spin on each cut that it turned out being \\"his\\".  I love Soul, love Seal!   Keep the music coming!!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I am completely obsessed with this soundtrack. I listen to it at least once a day. Rob Pattinson's songs are fantastic!! I'm just upset that it's not a longer disc. I wish they could have added all the songs, especially the one in the fight scene \\"Let Me Sign\\" is amazing! I hope they make a second one and add all the songs we are missing!z
B000FL7CAK|5.0|*Please note, if you have not seen Season Two and don't want me spoiling anything for you the viewer.  I suggest you rent Veronica Mars Season Two on Amazon.com on Demand, Netflix, or The Playstation Network.  If you don't care keep reading.      The season picks up three months after the ending of season one when it is discovered Aaron Echolls murdered Lily Kane.  Much like the pilot episode there are a lot of flashbacks to went on during the three months after the solving of Lily's murder.  We find out Logan Echolls was the mystery person behind Veronica's door at the season one finale.  We also find out that Weevel's cousin Felix was stabbed by someone and throughout the season Logan is the assumed killer.  Another thing that season one and season two share is the big event.  Like the murder of Lily Kane which dominated season one as Veronica's huge case to crack (which actually gets wrapped up in a big way at the end of the season.)  Season Two's big event involves a school bus crash which takes the lives of seven people including Veronica's close friend Meg Manning who plays a bigger role than ever thought possible when we met her in season one.    Veronica's love life gets into a Triangle ... like we didn't see that coming at the end of season one.  The two men fighting over her friends Logan Echolls and Duncan Kane.  This not being a pivitol arc I won't spend too much time with this for this reason.  It seems like filler, Veronica Mars has never been a series like [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)]] where the title characters' love life is so important to the seasonal arc.      What is important to Season Two's arc is the addition of new characters and or characters we met back at the tail end of season one.  Dick Casablancas (the name fits his character) who doesn't go through that many changes but has a small part to the bigger picture of Season Two.  Cassidy \\"Beaver\\" Casablancas (Dick's younger brother) who goes through a huge character growth in Season Two and actually becomes a huge player in the end of the season.     The new mayor Woody Goodman played by Steve Guttenberg of [[ASIN:B00019074O Police Academy (20th Anniversary Special Edition)]]  plays a character so different than the man most people knew from the 1980's.  Then there is Jackie Cook daughter of Neptune Shark's icon Terrence Cook who eventually becomes Wallace's on again off again girlfriend.  Her role in Season Two is very minor, who only role really was to be a love interest for Wallace.      The biggest guest star of the season is probably Charisma Carpenter better know to audiences as Cordelia Chase on [[ASIN:B000TLTCU4 Angel - Seasons 1-5 30-Disc DVD Set]] .  In the second season she plays Dick and Cassidy's gold digging yet very fine young stepmother Kendall Casablancas a character that Charisma says is like a sexier, more evil Cordelia think of Cordelia from [[ASIN:B000I0QLQY Angel - Season One (Slim Set)]] is a little more selfish and more evil.      All and all Veronica Mars Season Two left me speechless.  But unlike Season One's finale Season Two's finale almost told the audience there will be a season three.  If you were a fan of season one, you will be a fan of season two.

There she falls in love with fellow student Avigdor (Patinkin), who in  turn is in love with Hadass (Irving). After numerous complications  ensue, Yentl, determined to get what she wants, leaves Europe for  America to pursue her dream of serious study without needing to hide  her identity as a woman.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|The albums starts off very strong. The first 7 tracks are all great, they include the singles Karma, You Dont Know My Name, Diary & If I aint Got You. The album seems to peak after Diary because the album hits a low point with Dragon Days which is the worst song I have heard from her. After Dragon Days the album starts to sound like any old R&B album with songs like Wake Up, So Simple, & When You Really Love Someone. Even though they are good songs they are not as good as the first seven tracks. Slow Down is a great ballad that stands out. Than the album finish off with Samsonite man which is just another song to me. Nobody not really is a good song and a great way to finish off. In conclusion this album has a lot of strong songs and even the songs that are not as strong are still enjoyable (except for dragon days).I would recomend this CD to anyone that like R&B music that has substances.
B0015FML06|5.0|I've been a fan of the CD for many years, but I had never actually seen the concert video until now.  This video is amazing, definitely worth the price of admission.  As one of the earlier reviewers wrote, you hear the definitive versions of most of the material featured here, and for my money, this was U2 at their height - they may have gone on to become superstars, but this was really them at their best.  The music is sharp, cutting, and well-played, and the cameras caught some extremely dramatic shots, made even more so by the elemental factors, the rain, the temperature, etc.  I personally would have loved to have seen the CD redone and expanded, but lets face it - if you already have the CD, you're getting this for the video, and the video alone is worth the acquisition.  I would call this one of the best concert film/videos of the '80s.  The packaging is also good (as with all of their recent reissues), and I enjoyed the still photos.  All in all, a great package.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|ENTOURAGE, FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS, GENERATION KILL, and now...TRUE BLOOD:  HBO has created another winner!  What's the show about?  Blood and Sex!    Those of you who have read the other reviews here may have noticed that poor reviews typically come from viewers who had first read (and loved) the series of books written by Charlaine Harris.  I have also read the books (after I saw the series), and I can tell you...the HBO series is much MUCH better.    The first season of the HBO series is based upon the first Harris book, but the show has diverged quite a bit from that book, and rightfully so, in my opinion.   The producers astutely decided to veer away from the lightness of the novels towards a darker, edgier vision and in the process gave the story much more depth (MUCH more than is contained within the \\"romance-novel\\" flavored books).  Let's hope they stay the course!    Arguably the best opening credits of any TV show, ever (MADMEN comes in a close second).  Great cast, great characterizations: more fully developed (and thus much more interesting) than those in the novels, and a great Anna Paquin as Sookie Stackhouse.  One of the best shows of 2008 -- check it out!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I have never enjoyed war movies but, Generation Kill is fascinating.  I have purchaced the DVDs in addition to watching the entire series several times on HBO.  The real life Marines are incredible and the actors that portray them have done a wonderful job.  Also, the commentary with each episode has given me new insight.  Well worth your time to watch this.  Coni B.
B00005221M|5.0|I ordered the DVD \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" and had a selection choice and chose the one clearly marked \\"Director's Expanded Edition\\".  When it arrived and I unpacked it to play the DVD I discovered that only the cover sleeve was marked \\"Director's Expanded Edition\\", there were not additional minutes of filming nor special features as noted on the back of the sleeve.  I was disapppointed but did not complain to Amazon nor did I return the DVD; I am not a 'returner'.  The movie itself was wonderfully acted; it is about time actual Native Americans are employed in lead roles, speaking native tongue, English and French.  Hence, my rating for the film itself.  However, I will think twice before I purchase anything from Amazon in the future.  Shame, shame, shame.   M. Luttrell, PA
B001F290E4|5.0|This CD of Seals is so very enjoyable.  It is just wonderful.  This is the only cd of Seals I have, but I know that I will be purchasing more of his music.
0201633612|5.0|My grandson wanted it, I got it and he loved it.  The order shipped and arrived in a timely fashion and it was in good condition.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|One of Aronofsky's best movies and certainly a movie that should make its way into anybody's collection.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This is an excellent CD even for the individual who is only a casual CD fan.  The music is very soothing yet at the sametime mesmerizing.  A real plus for any fan whether or not they dig New Age.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The newly added vibration function, in accordance with the Playstation 3's state-of-the-art graphics, gives you an even better next-generation gaming experience!
078322947X|5.0|It is beyond me what the Amazon.com reviewer found so wrong with this film. Now, I haven't seen the original (Cruezot's Wages of Fear, 1955) and I'm sure it's magnificent, but if anything I think that our reviewer is so affected by his loyalty to the original film that he is unable to watch Sorcerer with an impartial eye. Too bad for him, because he missed an unforgettable experience.     I saw Sorcerer late one night on a cable channel, at least sixteen or seventeen years ago. I was immediately struck by the palpable terror and tension of this film. The performances of the four leads are all superb, though even with Scheider's character standing out as it did, it was the character of the Frenchman, Serrano, that I found most compelling. His ability to handle any situation with a cool head and intense inner strength was fascinating to watch.       But of course, the real treats of this movie are the scenes that highlight the tension that simmers throughout: the crawl of the huge nitro-laden trucks across the disintegrating rope bridge in a sheeting rain storm...well, I won't mention any more or it will ruin the film.    This is a great film, a truly underappreciated classic. Buy it.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Wow - if I didn't hear it on NPR I would never have bought the CD. Track #3 is worth the cost of the whole thing. F'n brilliant.
0385751893|5.0|This book is warm, chilling and haunting.  So far, 3 people have agreed with this synopsis.   This book should be required reading, but I'm not sure for whom anymore.   We just can't forget what DID happen, and some people tend to just forget.   Once I get this book back, as it's going onto 3 others, I'm keeping it.   To read again, once I stop thinking about it.  It's just excellent.  If you like kids and history, make this book on your next list to buy.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I know there were other \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" presentations but this is the one and only. No other can compare with the way this story is presented. I loved it as a child and still love it as an adult. It is a true classic.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|This movie arrived quickly in mint condition and new shrink wrapping.  My son is going to love it!
B000002UAU|5.0|Before this album was released, nobody took rock music very seriously. Before this album was released, rock music was just something that you could dance to (although it still made a point but nevertheless, just dance music). When this was released however, the face of rock & roll would change. Yes my friends, this album can never be overstated. Sgt. Pepper's is definitely one the best albums the Beatles ever made (just the White Album or Abbey Road can be defined at their magnum opus). If your a classic rock fan, add this on top of your shopping list.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Whilst I think it fairly unlikely that this DVD will convert new fans to the love of all things Rush, for existing fans (and I expect your already are, dear reader), this DVD is well worth the cash. I was lucky enough to be at one of the shows on this tour, and the two disc-set is a very fine representation of actually being there. The sound and vision is of very high quality. Rush DVD over time have always been so, even the early ones, but the newest and brightest technology really allows this band to shine. On top of that, the Snakes and Arrows album is one of their best in many years, so the material being played live is very much worthy of attention. I think this shows through in the performance - i.e. they know this latest album contains some very fine material indeed and they really enjoy playing it. Juxtaposed to some of the best material from the 'classic Rush' period (perhaps, Jurassic period?) this makes for a great concert experience. For a band that has been touring, and touring hard, for 30 years I do wonder how long they can keep it up? All three members have retained their enthusiasm for the work and their musical dexterity (for my money, there's more raw talent and technical excellence packed into their performances than any other band playing today). I do have the R30 DVD as well, which contains some interesting old footage in addition to a recent concert, but this is way better overall. Not quite as good as my favorite concert DVD ever (Pulse, Pink Floyd....you gotta buy that), but  a very close 2nd - and one I can see my self slipping into the player to savor the thumping surround sound and crystal clear images, again and again.     And-a one, and-a two, and-a one, two, three, four.....
0780619951|5.0|This movie deserves more credit than people and critics give it. Personally, this film has what it takes to become a cult classic. The actors are great, epecially Marlon Brando.    The designs by the late great special effects man Stan Winston are flawless. The creatures of the island are both realistic and creepy. If you're gothic, you'll love this movie, and if not you should see it at least once.    Personally, I suggest that you buy this great cult classic. It's affordable and you'll be entertained over and over again. So...what are you waiting for?! Buy now and enjoy!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I have been waiting for this album forever! Now thats its here im yet again very pleased. The album has the classic Nickelback sound to it but with a little twists every now and then. In a few songs the music is edgier than previous albums. Overall its great and I recommend it to anybody!
B001GQACGE|4.0|So.. I was looking for a dud here from her, but I was pleasantly surprised. Beyonce has grown up. The message is new, and her fans are with it.
B00005JLIU|5.0|Thoroughly Modern Millie is a very excellent musical. Very funny and well worth the money I paid for it
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Horton hears a who is delight for anyone who is a fan of the book. A lot of laughs and is fun for the whole family
B00005NWM3|5.0|this is a great product.  received in great condition.  received in a timely manner.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Even though I enjoy all the Dire Straits CDs, this has always been my favorite. One reason is that it has, in my opinion, the best mixture of \\"fast\\" and \\"slow\\" songs, and all of them are quite different.  The lyrics are really diverse, from supernaturally \\"Calling Elvis,\\" to the hilarious \\"My Parties\\" to the fun \\"My Bug\\" to the haunting \\"Planet Of New Orleans.\\"  The latter is my favorite song here and, to me, shows Knopfler's talents like no other song.  Actually, each song on this compilation is completely different from the others.    When you can start any piece of entertainment, CD, movie, book - whatever - off with a big bang, you've made an impressive start and that certainly is the case here with \\"Calling Elvis.\\"  It's a great, great opening number and sets the tone for a very entertaining disc of music.      It ends that way, too, with the catchy country-sounding \\"How Long,\\" making you smile and want to listen to the CD all over again. I've done that so many times I've lost count.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|We received the movie quickly and it was in perfect condition. It's a great movie, my son loves it!!
0375826726|4.0|Eragon finally gets the his own sword and one of the things Solembum said came true. Varden finally start moving again during the middle of the book to attack Empire. But the most interesting part i think was when Roran was sent on various missions to attack supply trains and stuff. I think Paolini described those very well. The part about Eragon's father was kind of obvious. I mean when you heard it from Murtagh that he was his brother well it didn't sound right. Also Paolini gives a hint about why Galbatorix is so strong and how he gets his power, but its only a hint. Later Oromis and Glaedr tell the whole thing. It sucked he had to make it into 4 books, but if he wouldn't do this the characters would still be freaking cardboards doing whatever Paolini told them too. But he developed them and made them into something we could believe
0446579939|1.0|Sparks needs to come up with some better ideas.  This book is predictable and not that interesting.  I liked some of his other books, but I don't know what happened to this  one.  Very cheesy.
B001G5ZKZS|4.0|This release is, by far, the best production and performance of the recent three concert DVD's from Rush (the other two being R30 and Rush in Rio).     Performance: The band, esp. Neil, is grooving like mad and there is a nice, fat, pocket notably absent in the previous two recorded shows. Neil has definitely spent some time on his approach and has a much more relaxed feel that really keeps the tempos locked in and steady. The previous DVD performances, esp. R30, had major problems with tempo throughout. The band members really hit their stride on this show.    Material: Fantastic, broad in scope, something for everyone, etc.    Production: Very good overall, with nice camera work for the most part. Probably too many transitions, some quite jarring and abrupt, but not a big deal. The audio is too compressed sounding for my taste, but others may think it's spot-on. Also, while I like natural sounding lower frequencies, the punch of the bass drum and Geddy's lower octaves are lean and completely without \\"slam\\". Dialing in the lower frequencies seems to be difficult for these Rush releases for some reason - either too much or too little. The audio side of the production is the sole reason for my 4 versus 5 star review.
B001DHXT20|3.0|If you are interested in a Hulk with high calibre acting and character investment but that's short on The Hulk and action sequences then go watch Ang Lee's The Hulk instead. If you felt that Ang Lee's The Hulk was like something out of a Danielle Steel novel and just want to see the comic book realized onto the big screen with lots of action upon action and are prepared to sacrifice character content for monsters throwing each other through buildings then The Incredible Hulk is exactly what you want.<br /><br />The Premise is quite simple and works as a sequel to Ang Lee's The Hulk even if it does change the story somewhat. Bruce Banner (Norton) finds himself in South America learning martial arts techniques to control rage while the military try to get him to convert his unique biology into a weapon and dose up a super solider to track him down only to find that the super solider has lost control and so they need The Hulk to save the day. That's it in a nutshell.<br /><br />Overall this flick is pure cannon fodder. You can sit through it and come out satisfied that you have finally seen Marvel's The Hulk on the big screen. At the same time it is no Batman or Spider-man but that is probably the character's limitations even if Norton does but in a good effort. If you want to see things getting trashed left, right and centre with some very good special effects then The Incredible Hulk is where it is at.
1400034205|2.0|Half way through the book and I still dont know the plot. Too much boring detail about how people dress, where they are going to go,,,,ugh.
B0010X745K|5.0|The Mist is an absolutely stunning horror movie. It has everything a monster movie should have such as suspense, panic, terror, madness with some powerful performances to boot. The premise is simple. A mist settles on a town and shoppers find themselves in a supermarket defending themselves from monsters that appear in the mist... and then having to defend themselves from each other. It leaves you asking the question \\"are the monsters on the inside or outside?\\"<br /><br />That dichotomy is what drives the film. It is very much about human behaviour under extreme duress in this survival horror as people doubt there are monsters and go outside, go outside anyway for a cause or to save somebody or a family member, start a cult inside that blames \\"unbelievers\\" or form separatist movements to plan an action of escape from the mystery mist that brings with it a wrath of monstrous proportions.<br /><br />The ending grabs you by the scruff of your neck and rattles you emotionally. It is the sort of ending you thought Hollywood never had the brass pair to make and yet when it comes you wish it hadn't. Not that the twist isn't good, it delivers a punch, but rips your heart out with it. Never has a film explored such dark realms as this has. You can't say in the end that you enjoyed the mist, but you can say that you lived through it. Unforgettably depressing but stylish and enduring, it is still a must see and daring brilliance.
0545128285|2.0|I can't describe this book. What is it? It's five \\"fables\\", and by \\"fables\\" I mean \\"surreal short stories with no notable characters, conflict, or action, only a minor message\\". And the message? The same anti-racist sentiments rehashed over two dozen times (see also: house elves) in the Harry Potter series. There is commentary by Albus Dumbledore on each story, and these sidebars actually amount to just as much content as the fables, and add up to a grand total of one hundred seven pages. It would have probably been around thirty-five, but the publisher used a ridiculous margin size.    I think I would have been happier with nothing at all. In Tales, Rowling stumbles upon three, and exactly three, humorous notes by Dumbledore (pages 19, 35, and 80), and two, and exactly two, remotely interesting pieces of lore to add to her universe (pages 83 and 104). The second of these is her sad, disingenuous response to the thousands of critical readers who, after reading Deathly Hallows, cried, \\"Wait, I thought you said the wand chooses the wizard!\\" Her effete reply: \\"Not really.\\"    None of these stories are remotely interesting or invigorating. I only hope that what I'll suppose will be immense proceeds from the sales of this book will support the Children's High Level Group in a great way, as Rowling correctly believed that she could write anything and it would sell.    Hearing Dumbledore's voice again is pleasant. That is all.    EDIT: After rereading the chapters of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that deal with this book, the idea that the three main characters could read the Tales of Beedle the Bard, reinforced only by the words of a crazy tabloid rag editor, and believe it as true makes them appear incredibly stupid.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This was a delighful movie and the nieces and nephew enjoyed it very much , as well as I.  It taught a very good message to all of us.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|I am not going to waste time talking about the film, as people looking at buying this have already seen it.  The two disc is a total waste of money.  All you get on the bonus disc are a digital copy of the film(which you don't need if you have ripping software), and really stupid bits about how the composer waited to adapt the film to Heath Ledger's acting(seriously?), a documentary of the making of the new Batman suit(I DON'T CARE), and an especially stupid set of fake CNN clips where \\"pundits\\" discuss current events happening in the film(really poorly thought out farce).  Had I known this is what I would be getting for the extra money, I would NEVER have bought it.  WASTE OF MONEY!!!
0956010903|5.0|Just got both, the Collector's Edition of Tales of Beedle the Bard and the standard edition, for Christmas. The Collector's Edition is beautiful and impressive.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|Awesome disk with good variety of tracks/guest artists.  Santana is truly a multi-dimensional warrior!  Everyone should listen to \\"Put Your Lights On\\".
B001L51RQE|5.0|The Bad: The packaging is weak because the discs keep sliding out.<br /><br />With that out of the way this CD/DVD package is a miracle of great mixing and whatever post production fixes they did.  I saw them twice on the '07-'08 tours and own bootlegs of them playing in various countries on this tour.  This package sounds better than anything I ever saw live or heard in a bootleg format.  They also play their set list better on this DVD package than they ever did from what I heard.  It was recorded live in Buenos Aires over two days so the editors had some brilliant performances to choose from.<br /><br />This piece of product is everything a TRUE Police fan would want them to sound like.  They're not arrogant, ambitious and faux punk-rock-reggae guys hungry to make it anymore.  They're mature, famous, top-notch musicians, playing excellent songs.<br /><br />The overall sounds, guitar tones, bass, drum sounds and mixing is top of the food chain.  The video coverage and shot composition is superb.  Purists who still think it's 1983 may not dig all the song modifications such as the lowered keys, modulations and new-fangled textures, but they can bite me.  Sting isn't 27 anymore and he sings those old songs with the honesty of a guy in his 50's the way he should.<br /><br />Summers got raked over the coals on guitar forums for playing too much outside stuff during his solos on this tour.  It was like he forgot what a pentatonic scale was.  He was also hitting a lot of clams (bad notes) and sounded under rehearsed.  In this package he brings it all together and wails with precision, great ideas and wild abandon.  His patented shimmering chord textures are ungodly.  Whoever helped him design his pedal board needs to get The Nobel Prize.  He fades in perfect synth parts over muted guitar lines and gets great dirty tones.  He's a joy to listen to on this package.  He is a true guitar innovator.  It doesn't even matter that he rarely played his trademark Telecaster.  The Strat/Whammy combo gives him a lot more expression and he expresses a lot on these discs.<br /><br />Copeland has calmed down in his maturity and refrains from rushing, speeding up, or over playing like the old days.  I miss the old Copeland.  It's what made The Police such a rhythmic force of nature.  He still replicates a few of his signature reggae/ska/rock fills but he's much more in service of the singer these days.  He plays wonderfully but I miss the tension and shameless virtuosity he use to create.  The days when Summers would scream at him on stage to, \\"Slow down!\\" are long gone.  Today he sounds like a normal drummer imitating Stewart Copeland on Xanax.  His current style of drumming works much better musically and it's not like Sting is demanding him to \\"rawk\\" harder either.  It's a different band.  Sting lost the rawk long ago as well.  This is a smooth rawkin' band.<br /><br />Sting is a Golden God.  His voice is in rare form.  He hits all the high notes (Thanks to some lowered keys.), holds them forever, improvises vocal passages and plays perfect bass.  He actually sings high parts while improvising funky melodic lines at the same time.  He plays bass like a songwriter; tasteful and always in service of the song.  His bass tones are rich, full and never muddy.  His ideas for filling out some of the songs with Taurus pedals and pre-recorded backing tracks works like a dream.  It compliments the songs while still maintaining the spaciousness that is part of the Police sound.  It all works!<br /><br />If you're a true Police fan you deserve to pleasure yourself with this package.  The accompanying documentary of the behind the scenes rehearsal stuff is great.  If you missed the tour, it's ok.  This package sounds a lot better than actually being there.  It's The Police the way they deserve to be heard.lot more expression and he expresses a lot on these discs.

B00011RPB0|4.0|For all the acclaim Sofia Coppola's film LOST IN TRANSLATION won upon its release in 2003, I didn't expect the film to have much staying power. For one, upon every viewing one gets increasing peturbed by its treatment of the Japanese, among whom washed-up American actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and recent college graduate Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves. Bob is in town to film a whiskey commercial, while Charlotte accompanies her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi), who swiftly leaves her alone in her hotel while he goes off to a shoot. Bob, experiencing a midlife crisis, finds company with Charlotte, who is experiencing her own uncertainties the future of her marriage and her ability to establish a career. Together they survive their week among an alien culture with an immense language barrier. Are Coppola's jokes about the Japanese (l/r confusion in phrases like \\"lip my stockings\\") adequate ways of expressing Bob and Charlotte's difficulties, or are they just cheap shots? Should we condemn Bob and Charlotte for making so little effort to adapt to their surrounding society, or should we empathize with their difficulties? The cultural issues surrounding LOST IN TRANSLATION might be perennial.<br /><br />But as I saw this film yet again recently, I find it very thought-provoking, and that certainly makes it stand out among Hollywood productions of these times. As Bob enjoys a night out on the town courtesy of Charlotte, hitting the bars and then going to an after-party in some flat where he smokes up and sings karaoke, we wonder about the possibility of regaining lost youth. When Bob ultimately kisses Charlotte at the close of the film, we are led to question whether merely platonic friendships of the sort they had established earlier can really last. And certainly, regardless of its occasional depiction of Tokyo dwellers as weird, the film does inspire a great desire to visit Japan and see it for oneself. The visuals of LOST IN TRANSLATION are occasionally so lovely that they leave the plot behind.<br /><br />The film is also has Bill Murray's best performance of his post-GROUNDHOG DAY period, where he became an expert at depicting jadedness. Here this air of being total disinterested in his surroundings is tempered by a warm humanity. Johansson's acting, on the other hand, may be the film's weakest aspect. Regrettably, her presence in the film works only when she is basically just an object, which Coppola often uses her as (the opening shot is of her pantied buttocks as she lies in bed).so lovely that they leave the plot behind.

I think that Kerrelyn Sparks is an awesome writer because her romances aren't just sappy love stories, there's a plot to this series and it's interesting. I love romances but this one also has action and adventure and it keeps you hooked on wondering whats gonna happen with the story and with the couples romance in the story it's self!   I totally recommond the whole series to everyone interested in romances with action!!!

1400063515|5.0|This (and its sister book 'Fooled by Randomness') completely blew me away. I am a 24 year old finance major, now working as a management consultant, with a real interest in markets and psychology.    The central thesis of the books are tantalisingly simple: the world is so functionally complex (and growing ever more so) that most social phenomena are effectively `random'. Randomness, however, is poorly understood and even more poorly explained by orthodox mathematical modelling which systematically underestimates the `wild randomness' inherent in the world. Taleb suggests (and attempts to demonstrate) that merely understanding the deficiencies of orthodox thinking with regard to randomness (and probability) is a big advantage in life.    The book(s) are a must read for people looking to understand more deeply the world we live in and the limitations with mainstream thought generally and modern portfolio theory more specifically.  I cannot recommend these books highly enough. I read them both in a couple of days and have found them totally absorbing (in a way few books truly are). They challenge and confront and pull the reader out of his or her `comfort zone' with regard to many perspectives on the world. The core readership of the book will obviously be those interested in behavioural finance but I would happily (and will probably) give the books as presents to friends who hate finance. I will probably also give the books to my mother, which for me is the test of whether I consider a book a `must'.    Having said that the author (this is perhaps at times a symptom of his unique writing style) does at times become rather grandiose. He suggests not advising others about how to behave and then only a few pages later commits the very sin he has just warned against. In `Fooled by Randomness' he invents fictional characters \\"Nero Tulip\\" (hmm could the initials N.T also stand for someone else?) - the brilliant but modestly profitable trader (that due to massive risk aversion only invests in treasuries) who overcomes cancer but is overshadowed by a flashy superstar trader neighbour who later `blows up'. In `The Black Swan' Taleb later details how he has overcome cancer and is very risk averse, investing a large percentage of his worth in treasuries. This grandiosity is however in the end totally forgivable due to the ability of the anecdotes to entertain and inform the reader.     One other thing that I found slightly difficult to follow (admittedly I am convinced that I am not as smart as the author so it may be my fault) is the fact that in `Fooled' he correctly discusses peoples' inability to think in terms of conventional probabilities and then sharply criticises those `experts' who rely on such probabilities in managing financial risk (a theme built on very powerfully and convincingly in `Black Swan'). There is the risk that (without meditating somewhat and trying to assimilate everything) the reader will be left nodding at everything Taleb says, but later wondering how it all fits together.    Finally, coming from a legal background I found the discussion in `Fooled' about the warped use of probabilities in the OJ Simpson trial very interesting. The author discusses the legal burden as being `beyond a shadow of a doubt'. I am from Australia (with a different legal system to the USA) but this seems a mistake. I would have thought the correct criminal legal burden would be `beyond reasonable doubt'. This is nitpicking I know.    Great book(s). Priceless wisdom and insight.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Disney outdid itself with Mulan, the story of the klutzy and unfeminine daughter of a wounded warrior, who replaces her father in the army and saves China from the Huns.  The music, action, story, and comedy are uplifting, positive, and... funny!<br /><br />Mushu, a wise-cracking dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy, is an incredible asset to the story.  He's the sophomoric sidekick, the comic relief.  Murphy really is the right voice here.<br /><br />This movie should be required viewing by all who think women should be kept in their place.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|GREAT movie, Heath Ledger was awesome, the scope, visual effects, and storyline were awesome!!!  Well worth the money (in terms of the MOVIE itself)!  One problem I had with it was the same problem I have with all movies that have came out lately, the audio being quiet with the dialogue and then becoming extremely loud when action sequences kick in, so you are constantly adjusting the volume...  Looks great on blu-ray even on my regular SDTV (you CAN tell the difference even if you can't afford HDTV)... Bonus disc pretty much sucked it's just some Gotham news, Psychology of batman and enemies, gadgets, and trailers...  I was VERY upset that they had NOTHING on Heath Ledger, not one feature congratulating his success in the role, dying to make the movie, no in memory of, no Special Thanks (Christian Bale gets a Special Thanks though...), NOTHING!!  Just patting their selves on the back for making an awesome movie, it's CRAP that they would do that, if you want my opinion it's completely selfish and entirely RUDE not to mention him, also there are no interviews or comprehensive coverage of a whole lot of anything on the special features...  very disappointing, makes you feel like you wasted your money (on the 2 disc special)...  Don't get me wrong though the movie was FANTASTIC, best batman ever they took a much more serious approach as to the action and the Joker...
B001EC9V58|5.0|Simply put, Rec is one of the greatest horror films of all time.  I wanted to stand up and cheer when the end credits started to roll - it's that good. The fact that I never saw it coming probably adds to my excitement, but this is one of those rare treasures that keeps horror lovers like myself going. As we suffer through unnecessary remakes, disappointing sequels, and cookie-cutter plots, there's always that little voice deep inside our brains telling us that maybe the next film will set the cockles of our little black hearts on fire - my friends, Rec is that film. Naturally, the US had to go and create a remake ([[ASIN:B001MVYUR0 Quarantine (Ws Dub Sub Ac3 Dol)]]), but I urge you to get your hands on this Spanish original before you even think about spoiling the whole story by watching its American clone.<br /><br />I knew absolutely nothing about this film going in - not even the title. In fact, I wasn't even sure it was a horror film when I started watching it. It starts out as a documentary featuring journalist Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) filming a \\"while you were sleeping\\" segment at a local fire station. As we watch Angela try to figure out anything interesting to do as she interviews individual firemen and walks through the station, we join her in hoping that a call will come in and add some excitement to a pretty boring night. When the call does come down, it doesn't promise much in the way of action - someone needs help getting a door open - but that changes pretty quickly once the fire and television crews arrive at the scene. Neighbors recount hearing screams from the dwelling of a strange old lady upstairs. Chaos ensues once the firemen and a policeman make their way into the apartment, quickly necessitating a dire need for an ambulance (and not just for the old lady). The film maintains the feel of a documentary throughout, as Angela's cameraman Pablo scrambles to get the most revealing of shots (successfully capturing the goriest of injuries that looked pretty damned realistic to me). That unwavering, underlying thread of realism will be a staple for everything yet to come - and there is indeed so very, very much to come.<br /><br />Cue the paranoia and mutual suspicion as authorities arrive outside and begin to seal up the entire building, forbidding even the gravely injured from leaving. No one inside knows what is going on, and the authorities aren't talking - not even to the security guy struggling to maintain even a semblance of control among the motley crew of frightened neighbors, frustrated fireman, and the TV news crew filming everything that is going on. Things only get worse after a health official finally arrives - let's just say that, in this sort of situation, knowledge is not power. What follows, in the film's final half hour, is some of the most realistic, chaotic, intense, and frightening action to ever grace the big screen. Viewing everything that happens through the lens of Pablo's camera, the viewer essentially becomes another character in the film, trying to make sense of everything he is seeing or not seeing, then finding himself swept up in every instance of mad panic that sends everyone running pell-mell from one dark room to another or fighting for their very lives from the most unexpected of threats. The only times the camera stops rolling is when Pablo briefly accedes to the request of authorities to stop filming. With Angela continually barking at him to keep shooting, though, these little breaks in the action never last more than 15-20 seconds.<br /><br />The entire cast is superb up and down the line. I've heard that most of the actors and actresses weren't told exactly what to expect for each hair-raising scene, thereby adding to the intensity of their reactions, but all I know for sure is that I would have had no doubts whatsoever in believing that everything I had just seen was completely real if I hadn't known it was a movie.<br /><br />Get your hands on this movie any way you can.  It's a brilliantly conceived and even more brilliantly executed horror masterpiece that I now count among my favorite horror films of all time. Obviously, I can't guarantee that you will love the film as much as I do, but I can't begin to imagine how any horror fan could walk away from this film without having been deeply impressed.eived and even more brilliantly executed horror masterpiece that I now count among my favorite horror films of all time.

B000VWYNNW|5.0|The closest I came to a Live Led Zep concert was to see this film when it first came out.  I bought the album (LP) and treasured it for years.  Lately I bought the updated DVD which reminded me that some of the music was missing from the LP.  This acted as a teaser to get the CD with the missing music at some point when I didn't have anything else to buy (the CD is great but let's face it, if you already have the LP and the DVD, buying yet a third version of anything is a bit of overkill.)<br /><br />Nonetheless, I put on my WishList with a high priority.  And wouldn't you know it?  My nine-year-old did his Christmas shopping and picked it out for me from the list!  Wow!  So I sit here reading the reviews and listening to the CD.  It's great.  I will probably rotate the LP version from my iPod in favor of this!<br /><br />Once a Led Zep fan, always a fan!
B001EYGOG0|5.0|Tony Bennett and Phil Ramone have already proven an unstoppable combination in the studio, capable of conjuring musical magic with stunningly soul-searching, endlessly listenable appeal. With this superbly chosen set of 11 yuletide tunes and the impeccable musicianship of the Count Basie Orchestra to back them up they inevitably succeed again.<br /><br />What makes Bennett different from the younger crop of singers in contemporary music, however, is his dedication to perfection. Things cannot simply make the grade - they must be perfect. This high standard shows itself here on \\"A Swingin' Christmas.\\"<br /><br />Every note is perfectly nuanced, every syllable sung with thoughtfulness and emotional transparency. He has surrounded himself with the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of musicians and tunes of utmost quality to produce a recording destined to be a yearly hit for generations to come. When comparing the quality and - most importantly - sincerity of his singing to that others releasing seasonal discs, there really is no comparison.<br /><br />The Alan and Marilyn Bergman-penned \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\" is not a cover of the Mariah Carey original, but a rich, velvety warm ballad on celebrating the season with the love of your life. Those seeking a wedding song for holiday nuptials need absolutely look no further than this remarkable recording. Bennett's delivery tugs at the heartstrings without being emotionally manipulative. It is an absolute destined classic, and consummately romantic.<br /><br />The rousing \\"My Favorite Things\\" from Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"The Sound of Music,\\" an anthem to finding happiness in parts of life often taken for granted, becomes a bona fide anthem in Bennett's 82-year-old hands. \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" and \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\" are equally festive. Bennett sounds thoroughly invested, like he is having the time of his life, and this energy transfers to the listener.<br /><br />His takes on Judy Garland's \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and \\"Christmas Time Is Here,\\" which originated in \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas,\\" are understated and elegant. His voice also blends beautifully with his daughter Antonia's on their gorgeous, touching rendition of \\"I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm\\" - she really has a sweet set of pipes.<br /><br />Bennett puts his own particular stamp on the melodious \\"The Christmas Waltz\\" before leading into the disc's crystalline conclusion of \\"O Christmas Tree,\\" which alone makes this album worthy of note. Using a stark piano/vocal arrangement, Bennett reminds listeners here why he is the king of the throne of the easy listening/American songbook genre. The descriptive \\"heartfelt\\" is tossed around idly, but he truly nails it here. To listen to his delivery is to bask in the glow of the very essence of what the songwriters intended. If anything, he is able to use his 82 years to his advantage, and it makes for one heck of a recording.<br /><br />\\"A Swingin' Christmas\\" is sure to find its way into many holiday celebrations for many years to come. Neatly unfolding in a swift 38 minutes, its sole problem is its brevity. We are very lucky to have Bennett bringing audiences to their feet with excellent concerts, but that he can still deliver that same top-notch quality in the recording studio is proven here.<br /><br />For a fun, upbeat, gorgeously delivered set of holiday tunes, \\"A Swingin' Christmas\\" is the place to be.tmas Time Is Here,\\" which originated in \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas,\\" are understated and elegant.

B001NB5BXG|5.0|This is ABBA's last and best album. By this time the couples in the band have divorced and the shimmering quality of their music is kinda gone. But despite of that they manage to make their best album. It is a more somber and dark affair not as over the top as their other albums. Even the cover reflect this(one of my favorite covers ever by the way).Songs like \\"When all is said and done\\"( my favorite),\\"Soldiers\\" and \\"One of us\\" show a more mature quality in their music. 'Slipping throught my fingers\\" and \\"Like an angel passing throught my room\\" are beautiful but full of melancholia. As one of the bonus tracks you get \\"The day before you came\\" that's probably ABBA's best song with  very ominous music and clever lyrics. If you have to buy one ABBA album(besides the copy of Gold that you already have) get this one you won't be dissapointed.
B0017CW5J4|4.0|Everything was amazing about the Blue Man Group Concert except for one qualm that I had. I don't think that the female vocalist is half as good sounding as Venus Hum was in the original complex tour. The Blue Man Group should have brought her back as a guest vocalist for at least the recording of this concert. Other than that little complaint, the Blu-Ray is amazing.
B001NB37M8|5.0|let it be this one. Finally MP3s of ABBA on Amazon,  I've been waiting for awhile for this. This is in my opinion ABBA 's 2nd best album after The Visitors, thought is it more fun than that one. This is so full of catchy melodies and hooks, all the music is shimmering and over the top melodrama, I LOVE IT !!!!  Angeleyes is the best song here, it was  a minor hit for them. Many people are familiar with their hits especially the greatest hits album Gold but if you want to give ABBA's discography a try you should start here and then go to Super Trooper and The Visitors you'll be glad you did.
B000007PSR|5.0|This is a collection of recordings that were left out of the two solo albums presumably because they were too clever for EMI's pop chart entrepreneurs.<br /><br />Clowns and Jugglers is better and more imaginative than the version called Octopus on Madcap (good as that is), and it and the sparkling instrumental Lanky look towards the 1980s.<br /><br />Birdy Hop is unique and difficult to describe.  It is a blues word sculpture which has the singer and the subject of the song (the bird) built into the shape of the song as well as into the words and the performance. Another experimental song is Word Song which is the most condensed example of his song writing style. It consists of a list of mostly nouns playing off against each other, but it makes a fascinating song. There was a third songform experiment on the second album (Mindshot), but someone changed the title to It Is Obvious and made it seem just barmy.<br /><br />On first impression I didn't like there being so many accoustic guitar tracks and it took me years to like Rats (from the second album) without the group sound. But over the years I have become fascinated by his style of playing it, especially on Birdy Hop, Word Song, Rats, and the accoustic version of Golden Hair.<br /><br />This is a collection of out-takes but it is close to being as good as Madcap Laughs. It has several of Syd Barrett's best recordings and is essential for fans.
1594489505|5.0|I don't even know where to begin...this book truly changed my life. What these two women - Marium and Leila - go through is astonishing and heart-wrenching. You really root for them from the get-go and feel their pain as they experience heartache after heartache and disappointment after disappointment. They both experience so many awful things in their lives, separately at first, then together, that you begin to wonder if it will ever get better.   I loved this book, I'd recommend it to anybody and everybody. It'll move your very soul.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Interesting characters in and around a dysfunctional Swedish family.  A family member went missing in 1966 from a small island with no way to escape.

B0013ND30W|5.0|When Disney says they're putting something in the vault, they mean it. Just ask anyone who went questing for [[ASIN:B000F8O35U The Little Mermaid]] during the 1990's. I didn't yet have a blu ray player when Disney announced that Sleeping Beauty was going on hiatus, but I went ahead and bought it anyway. One of the selling points for me was that it came with a DVD copy of the movie in addition to the blu ray discs. I think it was brilliant. I could rest easy knowing that I had the blu ray edition, but I could watch the DVD copy until I got my player. The movie itself is one of those I watch for the way it looks rather than for a good story or plot. It's really a beautiful looking film, and the blu ray version is gorgeous. So buy it now and watch it later, but get it before it's gone.
B001EO2UJK|4.0|The best Surround re-issue effort to date from any band. Worth every penny but why no DVD-Audio? Why are the SACD versions sold outside USA & Canada?    Rhino has put quite the gem together with the 3 boxed sets. My only disappointment is lack of DVD-A. My current rig is 7 years old and there was no DTS 96/24 back then.  Having said that the remixes sound incredible through regular DTS mode (I had to watch The Eagles DVD-Video's in order to re-affirm myself how much better DTS Surround properly encoded sounds over Dolby Digital which can also benefit if encoded at lower compression rates - see P.U.L.S.E. DVD-Video).    Why can't other re-issue efforts be this good? Now how's about that Genesis Re-Union Tour while all of you are still alive (see Eric Clapton's comments on the Cream re-union mini-tour of 2005).    Merry Christmas
B00005ASHM|5.0|The best description I've heard of the \\"new\\" Beach Boys sound that this album brought is a \\"pocket orchestra\\".  Its delicate production, from the atypical rhythms to the calculated dynamics, changed music. To detail my statement, I mean that its complexity is matched by its simplicity.  It brought about many traditional elements of music knowledge together with the pioneering new sounds of the generation and formed a collective experience that was indeed unmatched by The Beatles at that time.     The complexities I speak of; choosing not only to just include many intuitive and detailed production techniques, old and new, but to also wisely choose how those elements should be used to create more atmosphere in the final product; finding rhythms hidden between what most of us perceive as correct, and once again choosing the right rhythm for a given song, not just what sounds \\"neat\\"; The rising and recession of tension with wise melodic choices and placement;  The variety of instruments and sounds, which also help create an atmosphere in the album, are all wisely used in ways that very few artist really understand... to compare it with similar uses found on more recent albums, it's not enough to just use an instrument such as the violin to create a sound, it's also important to use it to its extremities when and where its most beneficial to do so;  And lastly the lyrics, Brian Wilson's approach was unique and IMO still easily relatable, aside from that, he continued to further the way that lyrics and music go hand in hand by yet again -choosing the right sound- for the words.  All of these traits intertwine and work with one another to create a still very original album.   Also in regard to the latter points, there are some aspects within the album that can found elsewhere in earlier works, but once again, its the collective experience that makes this album so brilliant.      I consider this album to be more of a musicians album, the intricate layers and light touches are simply more appreciated by those that understand what is going on within each song.  It is definitely an album that any given person may pick up and fall in love with though.  The best way to understand the multifaceted layout of this album is to check out the DVD for Brian Wilson's Smile.  The live performance showcases a full band perfectly replicating the 2004 record.  It is nothing short of inspiring to see those talented musicians perform the album Smile, and in doing so detail everything I'm trying to convey in a way that my words could never express.  Netflix or download it or something if you are do enjoy both albums or even if you're just intrigued by mass critical appeal of this album and still don't understand it.    I've read quite a few reviews and am interested in the many comments that compare it to other music like, say, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  I think that touches more on musical preference as opposed to the more technical aspects of the album touched on  in the above paragraph.  The production work on said album and others mentioned are indeed works of genius. While any individuals personal tastes are the ultimate deciding factor in what's good or not,  I hope that more appreciation can be credited to, at the very least, the major influence this album brought to those who wrote your favorite albums.    I know the following is rather moot and of no particular use in such a review,  but it is in me to express these thoughts here...    Looking at this album from what is now considered pop music is a mistake.  For example, in common popular rock bands -- very simple song writing from a four piece band who plays their music completely straightforward and linear (for the record this statement isn't all inclusive).  There is no comparison. Many elements of music have been missing in the majority of this \\"MTV Generation\\".  I feel it has taken away many potential sensibilities within in us all-- Simply by saying the light subtleties that canbe picked up by our ears are unnecessary.  I can certainly see how the flood of bands with lack of detail can degrade anyone's ability to hear in such a way and more importantly, care about such things.  Regardless it's not for me to say what's right or wrong, certainly from a business standpoint it is far more beneficial to simplify rather than \\"complicate\\".  But for me in my little world, I enjoy hearing music that makes me think far more excessively and emotionally than I might alternatively.    One last thing, I'm not some Beach Boys fanboy.  I'm a 22yo musician/mechanic who simply enjoys good, talented music.  Not to name drop or anything like that, but my favorite band is YOB, which is far from the smiley \\"bubble gum pop\\" that this album has been described as.  I appreciate this album as a pure work of art, a timeless classic.  For me, any of the wide range of sounds found between the now numberless \\"genres\\" can produce a brilliant album.  It's only a matter of how you convey what you're feeling.  With this review I only hope that a bit more clarity might be shed onto the critical acclaim this album has progressively built up.
B00006AVRK|5.0|I love this series because it really makes me laugh and hardly anything does any more.  I love the episode called \\"Introduction on Broadway,\\" when Bertie and Jeeves are in New York.  Watching this series inspired me to read P.G. Wodehouse.<br />[...]

B000002UB3|5.0|One of th greatest albums by one of the greatest artists . Sure , there are a couple of tunes here that might be a bit over-played on your local classic rock station, but when you get past those , what was Side 2 on vinyl, is some of the best music ever recorded . It plays out like a symphony , one long piece of music with varying tempos , different movements , but all connected . I love it .
0316017922|5.0|Spoiler alert!  This book contains about a dozen \\"whoa, amazing\\" nuggets that could change your life, or at least tell you why you never changed your life, and I'm going to include all of them here just to have them listed somewhere convenient online for my benefit (and yours).  But as any Gladwell fan knows, you don't read his writings just for the \\"holy cow\\" moments, you read them for the journey he takes you on in delivering those moments.  This work provides several amazing journeys, even as they stray progressively farther from what seems to be the advertised purpose of the book: to illustrate how certain people become phenomenal successes.  We learn early on the secret to being a great Canadian hockey player, assuming you are already spectacularly talented and work hard.  But eventually we wind up learning not how to become a spectacularly successful airline pilot, but rather a spectacularly bad one.  No bother, the book is providing entertaining information that can transform your professional life.  So as for those dozen points, here goes, and you've already been warned:    1.  There was a town in Pennsylvania called Roseto where people lived far longer and suffered far less from heart disease than people of similar genetic stock, eating similar diets, and living in similar nearby towns. The only explanation researchers could find was that Roseto had a uniquely strong sense of community: family and faith were both strong, and the wealthy did not flaunt their success.    2. In the Canadian \\"all star\\" junior hockey league - the surest ticket to the NHL - the majority of the players on the winning team were born in January, February, or March.  The league was for players between 17 and 20 years old.  Why the month anomaly?  Because in Canada, elite hockey teams have try-outs at the age of 10, and the age cut-off is January 1.  In essence, the oldest 10 year olds are far better at hockey than the youngest 10 year olds, so the youngest (those born in December) have no chance to make the select teams, which are the only ones with excellent coaching.  The pattern continues all the way through high school.  Similar birthday patterns are seen in places such as the Czech junior national soccer team.  Makes you wonder about what \\"good for your age\\" means in academics too.    3.  Many researchers believe in the \\"10,000 hour rule,\\" namely that you need to spend about 10,000 hours on a skill - anything, including music, computer programming, business dealings in the expanding American West, or mergers and acquisitions - in order to become great at it.  This is something Bill Gates and the Beatles have in common, thanks largely due to circumstances beyond their control.      4.  At least 15 of the wealthiest 75 people in world history (in modern dollars) were born in the 9 years from 1831 to 1840.  They were old enough to have learned how to profit in the rapidly industrializing United States (via 10,000 hours of experience) but not so old as to have already settled down and been inflexible with their life options or concepts of business. Similar birthdate \\"coincidences\\" are seen among the wealthiest tech entrepreneurs including Bill Gates, and among some of the most successful lawyers in New York.    5.  In long-term studies, IQ is found to predict professional success - but only up to a score of about 120, past which additional points don't help.  Nobel prize winners are equally likely to have IQs of 130 or 180.  When minority students are admitted through affirmative action, their achievement scores may be lower, but as long as they are above the threshold, it does not affect the likelihood of professional success.    6.  Anecdotes from the \\"world's smartest man,\\" (according to IQ tests) Chris Langan, and the children of middle class families, suggest that \\"practical intelligence\\" about when, how, and with what words to speak up are a huge factor in success - specifically when speaking up can save you from losing a scholarship. Longitudinal studies of high-IQ children showed that a family's high socioeconomic background was more important to predicting success than very high IQ.      7.  Many people put in their 10,000 hours in something like computer programming, but then never find themselves in the midst of a revolution where people with 10,000 hours of experience are desperately needed.  Bill Gates did.  The connections he formed as an early highly-sought programmer helped him rise and found Microsoft.  Joe Flom, one of the most successful lawyers in New York, became a specialist in mergers and acquisitions before such transactions were considered \\"acceptable\\" business by mainstream lawyers.  When the culture changed in the 1980s to accept such dealings, Joe Flom was the best of the best who had put in his 10,000 hours in a now-mainstream business. He became an historic success almost overnight.    8.  When economically tough times hit, people stop having children for fear of being unable to provide for them.  However, this may be the best time to have children, because there are few other children competing for things such as classroom attention, spots on school sports teams, professors' attention, and jobs upon high school or college graduation.  There are also more children a decade behind them who will provide the demand for the goods and services the older children will provide.    9.  The typical airline crash involves seven consecutive human errors, and crashes are significantly more likely to occur when the more-experienced captain is flying the plane, as opposed to the subordinate first officer.  The likely reason is that the first officer is much less likely to speak up when he or she notices something wrong or a human error, and the captain is flying the plane.  Flights in countries with a large \\"power distance index,\\" which characterizes cultures where subordinates are generally afraid of expressing disagreement with superiors, are the most likely to crash.  This included Korean air, which had the worst safety record among major airlines until it instituted a program requiring subordinates to speak up when there were problems.  There are benefits to deferential, polite, and subtle conversation, but they are unlikely to be beneficial in stressful cockpit environments.    10.  There are at least two non-genetic reasons Asian people excel at math (and some tests have suggested that Asians may have genetic _disadvantages_ in math).  First, most commonly used Asian languages use a monosyllablic, ordered, regular system to describe numbers, unlike English and European languages.  This gives young children up to a year's head start in math.  Second, math often requires persistence and trial and error, characteristics also needed for successful rice farming, the dominant form of agriculture (and employment) in Asia even in the 20th century.  Hilarious evidence of correlation of persistence with high math scores is found in results on the TIMSS, an international math exam.  The beginning of the exam includes a tedious 120-question section that asks students about their parents' education, their friends, and their views on math, among other things.  It is exhausting, requiring great _persistence_, and some students leave it partially blank. If you rank countries by how many of the survey questions their students completed, and by the TIMMS score, the lists are \\"exactly the same.\\"  Holy cow!  At the tops of both lists were Singapore, South Korea, China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, and Japan.    11.  Students from middle class and poor neighborhoods show an achievement gap in reading that widens over the years of elementary school.  However, the financially poorer students progress (in terms of grades on standardized tests) the _same_ amount during the _academic_ year as the wealthier students.  It is during the _summer_ break that better-off students with better-educated families continue to read and learn, while the less well-off students likely do not,and show major declines in autumn test scores compared to the previous spring.  Students in \\"KIPP\\" (Knowledge Is Power Program) schools showed major success despite coming from low income neighborhoods, because of a much longer school day and academic year.    12.  The author, Malcolm Gladwell, tells a story in the final chapter about how his family, and thus he, benefitted from light skin tones and changing racial attitudes in Jamaica.  It's a stretch compared to the rest of the book, but gets you thinking and is an awkwardly charming read.

B000UAE7RW|5.0|This film is a masterpiece because it is nothing but what we expect and we expect something different at every single moment of it, so that we are disappointed and surprised and held breathless every fifteen minutes when one of our expectations goes down the chute. At first we think it is one more private eye's business or investigation in some kind of affair with some married man. But it does not fit at all with the professional dedication  of the suspected unfaithful man. He is obviously looking for something fishy in the water supply of Los Angeles he is responsible for. But then he does meet with a girl, doesn't he after all. And yet there is something fishy in that water supply. So it might be a big embezzlement case. Let Los Angeles pay for the water they will never get and then let Los Angeles get to the water where it will be, and let them pay again. The point is it does not explain everything, and especially why the thieving contractor is so keen on getting the hooker his son in law was seeing. Too keen to be honest. Is she a hooker after all? And we go on doubting, hoping, being disappointed and never getting to the truth of the business. Who the killer really is? Who the police really work for? Who the police tries to protect and cover? Why do the police do that unprofessional act? There is just no good enough answer, and even at the end, when the tycoon contracting embezzler gets the last word we know we are off the point and losing all footing in too deep water. That's probably the best part of this film. You just have to accept the situation the way it is and do nothing just because some people are big enough, rich enough or powerful enough to do exactly what they want and everyone else has only one choice, die or say yes-sir-mister-master-sir-boss. Even killing his own child is not a no-go option for such a greedy person. Remember, change we can, but change these tycoons cannot. So better change them than expect them to  change. Why not send them on a perpetual vacation in some desert island that has absolutely no connection with the outside world, But dummy, that's just the point, such a place does not exist. So better put them to death, put them to sleep or deep freeze them if you don't want to deep fry them, which stinks a little bit. But any other way will let them go on  with their shaggy and dirty business. But gosh it reaps a lot of profit in.

0956010903|1.0|I PRE-ordered this item on December 2nd. I received an E-mail stating that it shipped on the 6th, a tracking number and stated that I would receive my book on the 13th. I waited a couple of days to check on the tracking number, the information wasn't updated and still said that it left the warehouse on the 6th. So for a few more days I patiently wait. On the 13th still no book! So, I give amazon the benefit of the doubt, and called the post office. They told me that the shipping that amazon used didn't require that the package be tracked and that it wasn't guaranteed to be delivered until the 23rd. So I wait again, and still no book. I call the post office back and file a complaint. It turns out that the 6th was the day that amazon contacted USPS to tell them that the book was to be shipped, USPS never received the package and amazon will not send me a replacement! I guess this is more of a review of my amazon nightmare than the book it's self. I shouldn't have had to worry about getting this book, I pre-ordered it!
0743233832|5.0|I recently became interested in ancient philosophy and read three translations of Aurelius. For someone just starting out, this is the best introduction. The intro essay is useful. Yes, the translation slips into one too many Hallmark moments, but overall the translation is concise and pointed and, well, more modern. Compare this translation with the Penguin Classic and you'll see what I mean. Here is the Penguin classic:\\"...both the longest lived and the earliest to die suffer the same loss. It is only the present moment of which either stands to be deprived:and if indeed this is all he has, he cannot lose what he does not have.\\"  A bit long winded. Here is the Hicks translation: \\"...the man who dies young loses not a jot more time than the man who dies old. A man can only be deprived of the present monent, for this is all he has, and how can a man lose what he doesn't possess?\\" And, Aurelius strikes me as someone who would not write or speak in the more mannered  and formal Penguin classic way but  instead as someone who cuts clearly to the nub. Get both books, but start with this one.

B00005QAPH|5.0|\\"The movie business is macabre.  Grotesque.  It is a combination of a football game and a brothel\\".  Fellini, from the book Fellini on Fellini.<br /><br />Round and round we go with this film, one of the greatest films ever made, one of my top 10 films, and arguably Fellini's greatest work, or close to it (La Dolce Vita is as good as this one).  It's the film where Fellini went into surrealism and dreams and never went back.  It's also one of the greatest films ever made about filmmaking and the artistic process.  Despite being a cinema person, I don't like films about the business, as they become so esoteric (especially films made about Hollywood) that they are far too \\"inside\\" for most.  The Hollywood films (especially ones of recent vintage) give the impression that only in Hollywood are there problems on film sets, and that making films is difficult.  Problems exist on all films sets.  That's life.  8 1/2 is not esoteric.  It's a universal film.<br /><br />We see Guido, a famously successful film director, who is suffering from creative block, a ballooning budget on a film he doesn't want to make, martial problems, mistress problems, health problems, etc., etc..  At times, it's hard to tell what's real and what's imaginary, but you're ultimately not to supposed to know what's real and what's imaginary.  This causes much confusion at times, but it's supposed to be, and it works magically.  The film is really striking for many reasons.  Its excellent pace, wonderful, crisp photography, great performances, its unforgettable imagery, and one of the greatest endings in the history of cinema.<br /><br />For those who don't know, Fellini called this 8 1/2 because, according to him, it was his \\"8 1/2th\\" film.  He co-directed his first film (which he counted as half), and made 7 features up until this one.  Despite being made over 40 years ago, the film hasn't dated and remains, rightfully so, on many greatest films ever made lists.
0316017922|1.0|Outliers is about what makes people successful, and most of the book is effective at pointing out the effect of factors other than each person's individual talent or determination, particularly the family, the social lottery in terms of demographics, ethnicity or season of birth, and the opportunities provided by the economy. The author wisely does not define success, and looks at it in a variety of ways. It can be living long, rising to the top of a sport or an art, or accumulating wealth, but he does not include examples of scientists or politicians. He eloquently denounces crude metrics like IQs as predictors of success, as well as practices by schools or sport federations that choose young children for advanced programs by year of birth, and end up selecting the oldest within that year rather than the most talented.<br /><br />The first part of the book is on subject and both entertaining and enlightening. Other reviewers have criticized it as anecdotal, unscientific, and poorly researched. The anecdotes, however, told me a few things I hadn't heard before, and, if they have been expressed better in earlier books, that may be but I have not read them and I credit the author for bringing them to my attention.<br /><br />The second part, entitled \\"Legacy,\\" on the other hand, is off topic. The ethnic theory of plane crashes, for example, is about the pitfalls of cross-cultural communications in a business where it must happen: Korean crews must talk with American air traffic controllers. Interesting though these challenges may be their connection with outliers and individual success is tenuous at best.<br /><br />It gets worse in the chapter on rice paddies and math tests. The author alleges that a rice growing culture makes children good not only at math tests but at math itself, and just about everything he says in this chapter is overly general and questionable. First, if growing rice actually made people good at math, how come this body of knowledge was almost entirely developed in the Middle-East and Europe where rice was not a staple?<br /><br />The author makes much of the conciseness of Chinese number words as an advantage for Asian children, but Japanese number words are not concise: the words one, six, seven and eight have two syllables, and Japanese has not one but two sets of number words in use,  a native one and the one borrowed from Chinese. Conceptually, the Chinese way of counting is similar to the Roman system, and not particularly helpful for arithmetic. The key breakthrough in making additions easy was the numerals invented by Arabs.<br />He describes math in \\"the West,\\" whatever that label may cover, as being a \\"rote learning system,\\" but, compared at least to Japan, the teaching of math in the US or Europe involves considerably less rote learning. He also claims that \\"feudalism simply can't work in a rice economy\\" (p.236). What about Japan, which had a rice economy in a feudal system for 700 years? And, even though he acknowledges in a footnote that northern China grows wheat rather than rice, everywhere else, he equates Asian with rice growing.<br />The author also believes that long summer vacations were introduced in the US and Europe to give children rest. Another explanation is that children were given time off school so that they could help with harvests, and that the tradition endured after agriculture stopped being the main economic activity.<br /><br />At the same time, he omits one obvious explanation for the excellence of students from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore on math tests: they are key to success in the competitive entrance exams for universities. For similar reasons, if students worldwide were given SATs, Americans would probably come out on top.<br /><br />He concludes the book with the history of his own Jamaican family and how its circumstances shaped him. Is it relevant? Is the author one of the Outliers the book is about? In our own minds, we are all outliers.the Middle-East and Europe where rice was not a staple?

0380820498|4.0|I am becoming a big fan of Inspector Banks mysteries.  He is such an ordinary \\"copper\\", and I love watching his thought processes as he tries to solve a case.  In this case, a seven year old girl goes missing.  All the stops are pulled out to try to find her, but before they can they find a murdered man in an abandoned quarry?  It doesn't look like the two cases are related but as Banks investigates he finds out all kinds of things, and he finds a link between the two cases.  I love the characters in these books, and I love the mysteries.  For anyone who likes British police procedurals, this is not a series to be missed.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Every time I see a Pixar film I tacitly assume that they have taken CGI about as far as it can go.  Then with their next film they prove me wrong.  (Unfortunately, with some of their upcoming films about to go 3D, I think they will -- as someone who wears glasses I have never been able to enjoy a 3D film -- the disposable spectacles are simply not made with glasses wearers in mind, and unless they come up with a solution for guys like me many of us will be unable to enjoy them.)  I find it absolutely astonishing that WALL-E is getting so many one, two, three, and four-star ratings.  Come on folks!  What else would a film need to do to be worthy of five stars?  I think the film critics are getting it right on this one.  The film is consistently being named as one of the top two or three movies of 2008, regardless of genre.  The debate is centered not on whether it is the top animated movie of 2008, but whether it will be nominated in the Best Picture or Best Animated Film category at the Oscars.  If it is nominated for Best Picture, it would stand a very good chance of winning the Oscar.<br /><br />The great thing about Pixar is that they keep stretching the limits of what is possible in CGI.  Although trickle down doesn't work in economics, it does work in CGI.  As Pixar developed programs with deeper and richer texturing and layering, new CGI programs are developed for special effects corporations doing work for TV series and movies.  The reason we see such stunning special effects on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is because of cutting edge work being done by Pixar and others.  If you want to gauge just how far CGI has come, try looking at the CGI in BABYLON 5 Season One or SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND, both from the early nineties, and Season 3 of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  The heavily pixilated images of B5 have given way to the richly textured and infinitely more complex images of BSG.  And it is only going to get better in the future.<br /><br />As great as WALL-E is, the short film about a magician and his uncooperative bunny Alex is even better.  PRESTO is one of the best comic shorts ever made, right up there with Chuck Jones's great Donald Duck epic \\"Duck Amuck\\" or his Bugs Bunny classic \\"What's Opera, Doc?\\"  I haven't seen such comic invention in anything since the peak of the greatest Warner Brothers cartoons.<br /><br />As to whether this is a movie for adults or kids, I have to add that in my limited experience with kids' opinions, they don't have much of a problem with it.  It seems to be more adults thinking that kids won't like it than kids actually disliking it.  I think the way to look at it is that the filmmakers made a movie that they would like to see.

B00005R24K|1.0|Major disclaimer: I dislike horror as a genre pretty much from top to bottom. I am a major movie buff. I've seen quite literally thousands of films, have run film societies, and own a staggering pile of DVDs. But I don't like horror. I love nearly every other genre, from film noir to Astaire/Rogers musicals to screwball comedies to Italian Westerns to every imaginable form of Sci-fi, but I simply detest Horror. Doesn't matter who makes them, films by people like Wes Craven, Sam Raimi, and Eli Roth, not to mention lesser lights, just bore me to tears.<br /><br />THE EVIL DEAD was not only as boring to me as other horror films, the sheer amateurish quality (albeit gifted amateurs) added an additional layer of torture. There was simply nothing in this film -- not a single second -- that I found in any way, shape, form, or manner to be even remotely entertaining.<br /><br />OK, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the way I'm wired I'm constitutionally incapable of \\"getting\\" whatever there is to get in a horror movie. So, in a way, this review might end up saying more about me than the movie. Or perhaps it says more about most people who watch and enjoy this than it does about me. When I watch this, absolutely nothing steps forward to refute my conviction that this is complete and utter crap.<br /><br />I will add that Bruce Campbell's commentary is great. I actually watched this and the two sequels to the film because I was reading Campbell's account of his career as an actor, IF CHINS COULD KILL: CONFESSIONS OF A B ACTOR. I love the book; hate the EVIL DEAD movies. Obviously the two subsequent films engage in a great deal of self-parody. I found both his account of making the film in the book and his commentary on making the film on the DVD to be infinitely more entertaining than the film itself.<br /><br />In short, if you, unlike me, like horror films, especially no-budget horror film, you might like this. In fact, you will apparently love it, like most of the reviewers here. But if you don't like horror, you will, like me, probably view this movie as a different kind of horror film, in which the horror consists of your having to watch it. I'd rather watch a mime troupe than ever watch this again.like horror, you will, like me, probably view this movie as a different kind of horror film, in which the horror consists of your having to watch it.

Although trickle down doesn't work in economics, it does work in CGI.  As Pixar developed programs with deeper and richer texturing and layering, new CGI programs are developed for special effects corporations doing work for TV series and movies.  The reason we see such stunning special effects on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is because of cutting edge work being done by Pixar and others.  If you want to gauge just how far CGI has come, try looking at the CGI in BABYLON 5 Season One or SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND, both from the early nineties, and Season 3 of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  The heavily pixilated images of B5 have given way to the richly textured and infinitely more complex images of BSG.  And it is only going to get better in the future.<br /><br />As great as WALL-E is, the short film about a magician and his uncooperative bunny Alex is even better.  PRESTO is one of the best comic shorts ever made, right up there with Chuck Jones's great Donald Duck epic \\"Duck Amuck\\" or his Bugs Bunny classic \\"What's Opera, Doc?\\"  I haven't seen such comic invention in anything since the peak of the greatest Warner Brothers cartoons.<br /><br />As to whether this is a movie for adults or kids, I have to add that in my limited experience with kids' opinions, they don't have much of a problem with it.  It seems to be more adults thinking that kids won't like it than kids actually disliking it.  I think the way to look at it is that the filmmakers made a movie that they would like to see.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno starring Ellen Page is delightfully hilarious but also frankly delicate especially the last half hour. Page is a talented actress, Juno came across immature at first but the character truly grows up before the viewers eyes. Michael Cera and Jennifer Garner really surprised me here, they hold their own around Page's dry wit. The dialogue is something else, you gotta hear it to believe it! And by the way a film cannot make you pregnant, so let's just set that myth straight. I highly recommend this too cool for its own good flick, enjoy!
B000M4RGA6|5.0|Will Farrell (Harold Crick) shines, as the terribly OCD IRS agent, in this thoughtful film about grabbing life by the horns, verses succumbing to remaining an invisible spectator, one destined to---count tiles, steps, how many ounces are left in the soap dispensers, the strokes of the toothbrush, etc. The rigidity of this man's life and daily routines command empathy.<br /><br />Suddenly, Harold begins to hear voices.  Some feel it is a schizophrenic break, but he feels it is something more...something deeper, regarding his very destiny.  Could he be living the life of a fantasy character of someone else?  A full life he's never ever been able to create himself?  He's terribly agitated by the voices, but more so, when he hears that he is about to be terminated.  It is in this revelation, that he finally learns to become a man, face his fears, and remove the boundaries that have always surrounded him.  In doing so, Maggie Gyllenhal's rebellious, tax evading character, with a fair share of tattoos, enters the picture.  The unlikely relationship that evolves between them is, simply adorable.  He is left to wonder, though, whether their relationship will play out as 'a comedy,' or 'a tragedy,' as someone else is writing his script, which is accelerating beyond his control.<br /><br />You become a serious fan of Harold Crick and the developing relationship with the tattooed baker; this lonely guy who has never even had a homemade cookie.  But, destiny plays a large part of this film.  Will he be saved by the author, or become the unlikely, martyred hero?  You'll have a very enjoyable time finding out.  By the end of the film, you are so drawn in, you are willing to accept Harold's fate---wherever it may take him. The good, or the bad of it, this is the first taste of real life Harold Crick has ever experienced.<br /><br />Emma Thompson's character, as the author with writer's block, is brilliant.  She appears on the verge of madness, herself, as she plots and schemes different ways to off her chief protagonist, Harold.<br /><br />This is simply a lovely film, one that we talked about at dinner the next evening, because it left a significant imprint. Do give it some time. In the beginning, it seems rather silly, but it is like a fine wine...let it breath a little, to come to life.chief protagonist, Harold.

B001IA46D8|3.0|Barlow lends his voice to only a few songs, which is the first thing wrong with this album.  Also, it doesn't seem that John Shanks has written a single song on this. I follow Shanks' music endeavors because the songs he writes are so good, such as \\"Patience\\" by Take That a few years ago. There doesn't seem to be any of that here.  While the album is still good, my favourite track being \\"Where Is The Love\\", it doesn't seem to hold the same style of song as \\"Beautiful World\\", which is disappointing. There's no real stand-out songs on this.    But still, it's an enjoyable album.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Iron Man is one of those all too rare big budget movies that actually delivers. Downey was born to play Tony Stark but the real hero of this movie is the screenplay. A well written story, great charactors and terrific special effects.<br /><br />The film is about Tony Stark. The son of Howard Stark, also a genius. Tony inherits the company from his father when his father dies. He's basically partners with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges who also played the part brilliantly). Stark Industries is known for producing military weapons that, according to Tony, needs to be used only once to end a war. Tony soon finds himself captive of an Afghan rebel group that want his weapons made for them, because whoever owns his weapons, basically wins the war. Tony creates the classic Iron Man suit to get out of the captives hands and once he does, Tony decides he doesn't want to create weapons anymore. He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it. The rest of the owners of Stark Industries isn't to happy with this and they decide to, basically, just not listen to Tony anymore. While Tony's company is basically doing whatever they want, Tony is in his mansion revamping his original build of his suit. Not to ruin anything about the story, lets just say Tony is about to put his new suit into some good usage.<br /><br />Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation but it is darn close. It holds Downey's best performance in a long time. It is a fun, comic actioner that sure comes close to a \\"perfect film\\". I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years. Highly recommended.
B000RGSOR8|3.0|I was blown away by the first track on this because of it's killer avant guitar but much of the rest sounds like standard 21st century singer/songwriter fare like you'd hear on a Target commercial.  It's good but it doesn't live up to the promise of the first track.
0375826726|3.0|I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE STORY.  ERAGON IS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER, BUT IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A TRILOGY.  THE WRITER SHOULD LEARN TO TAKE THE STORY AND KEEP IT INTACT.  IT DRAGS ON AT SPOTS WITH VERY LITTLE GOING ON.  THESE AREAS COULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND MORE OF THE ACTION AND STORY COULD HAVE BEEN TOLD ENDING THE TRILOGY AS IT WAS SUPPOSE TO.  AFTER AWAITING THE THIRD BOOK, IT WAS DISAPPOINTING TO KNOW IT WOULD NOT END AND TIE UP ALL THE ENDS.  I WILL READ THE NEXT ONE, IT HAS AT LEAST KEPT ME THAT INTERESTED, BUT HOPE IT IS NOT DISAPPOINTING.  NO COMPARISON TO LORD OF THE RINGS  - A TRUE CLASSIC, BUT THE WRITER IS YOUNG AND HAS A LONG TIME FOR GROWTH.
B001F290E4|5.0|Seal's rendition of Sam Cooke's \\"Change is Gonna Come\\" is worth purchasing this CD on its own merit; yet all the other songs are just as impressive.  I bought 3 CDs and gave them to some very special people in my life.
B000F3T3CS|4.0|L'Elisir D'Amore is one of the finest operas in the repertoire.  Its melodies flow so effortlessly that it's easy to lose sight of how fine and inspired Donizetti's accomplishment is.  And it's been well served on DVD (e.g., the Met version with Pavarotti, Battle, etc.).    This is a delightful production of L'Elisir, one that for sheer comedy is equalled only (to my knowledge) by Pelly's production of Fille du Regiment with Natalie Dessay. Rolando Villazon's Nemorino is the embodiment of what would happen if Harpo Marx found his voice, and it turned out to be a gorgeous tenor.  The duet \\"Voglio dire, lo stupendo elisir\\" where Nemorino buys the \\"elixir\\" from Dr. Dulcamara (Ildebrando D'Archangelo) is not only beautiful music beautifully sung, but a laugh-out-loud marvel of timing and energy that I've watched at least a dozen times.  It's worth the price of the DVD all by itself.      But I usually switch over to my DVD of the Met version for Act II.  Perhaps by this time in the opera I'm finding Anna Netrebko's Adina overly coltish.  For all that the Met version is more static, I seem to find the denouement more moving.  One big reason for my switch is a substantial cut in the Villazon/Netrebko version. We lose Adina's dialogue with Nemorino while all the village girls are making up to him, and the wonderful ensuing quartet.  I have no idea why this number was cut; it's not only a highlight of the show, but the point that signals the beginning of Adina's change of heart.  In a way, the cut is a backhanded tribute to the high quality Donizetti maintains throughout \\"L'Elisir.\\"  In virtually any other opera, cutting material this good would be unthinkable.    On the other hand, I like Leo Nucci's Belcore in this version better than Juan Pons in the Met version.  Both sing well, but Nucci, while a little old for the role, captures Belcore's bluster and bullying perfectly.  Pons' portrayal is bland by comparison.    I could make more comparisons between the two versions,but I'll close by saying that I wouldn't willingly part with either of them.  Lovers of this eminently lovable opera are lucky indeed.
B00006I53S|3.0|I was very hyped up for this lens, and I dont know what it was; either i got a \\"bad\\" copy of the lens, or i was overhyping myself or maybe both. First, the color is excellent in pictures taken with sufficient and excess light. Sharpness was actually (for me) the best at 135mm and mildly soft in between. (I am no professional but consider myself an experienced amateur/hobbyist, who expects more results than the average consumer). To me, the images needed P.S. sharpening almost always. Closeups, the lens was great and expressed the most sharpness and contrast. Bokeh was actually decent. The thing that dissapointed me the most (again overhype) was the image stablization. I dont know if i got a bad copy or wahtever, but whenever i had it on, it started making a noise that sounded like there was a loose part or something. It was not as fast a lens as you may think. f/3.5 can only be achieved with a focal length of about 28-35mm. After that, from 35-135mm, you use a higher f-stop. Using the image stablilization in low light was absolutely horrible. I had to be almost completely stable to get a sharp image in the range of 1/30 or below. If i was lucky, i could snag a 1/5 or even 1/4, but it wasnt close to even 30 or 40 percent. This WILL NOT! I REPEAT WILL NOT! Make your images guaranteed sharpness at any light situation. This baby needs alot more light than you would expect in low-light situations. of course, if you use a flash, the images get distorted in color slightly but absolutely get good images.   GOOD:   - Build quality, feels like a truck  - Didnt notice lens creep as people have said  - \\"Good\\" (B-) images with sufficient light  - Nice macro shots  - USM was fantastic: silent and super quick even in low light   - Bokeh    BAD:   - Image stabilization was noisy  - Yes, your copy may not be a good copy as mine wasn't  - Noticed hazy pictures randomly   - Wasnt sharp at all focal lengths, nearly at none  - Colors werent saturated enough  - Contrast and sharpness wasn't good at all until i was in macro.   - Image stablilization was not what you think it will be. It is somewhat noticable. But, note, this is not the current IS model, it is the old one. It will be very difficult to do panning, and only slightly helps camera shake by 1-2 stops (i think 1 stop does justice). Newer models of the image stablilzer do panning, and help reduce camera shake up to 4 stops.  - Not good in low light unless you are at 28mm and f/3.5    I didnt believe it when people said the image stablilzer and f/3.5 was still too slow and frustrating at times; believe it. There is 1 star taken off of my rating.   The other star was because the sharpness, contrast and saturation just didn't do it for me. Maybe for others, it would be suitable, but not for me.   In general, this is a nice walkaround lens, for someone who will be shooting in great light, no action sports, and wont mind using a flash at night.  ***UPDATE***: i got the 50mm f/1.8 for christmas from amazon for $84 bucks. This thing is a  animal! If you go to this items product page for this item, and see sample pics, i will upload some. They are phenominal! Look into that lens!
0375703764|5.0|this book will stretch your mind. it's one you can read several times over   (at least) and discover new layers of the story every time. danielewski is an amazing storyteller. i highly recommend this book.
0316067598|4.0|You'll either love this book or hate it... and your politics will likely dictate which. Parts of it will make your heart race and your jaw drop. It's as amazing a wartime exploit as has ever been written, a tale of personal courage and dogged determination. I honor Luttrell's epic service and sacrifice, and hope the burden of his service isn't too heavy a load. I honor the rest of his teammates and their ultimate sacrifices, as well as those of the rescuers who lost their lives in their ultimate expression of love. All that said, it's time to look at the book beyond feelings and admiration. Frankly, it's not a particularly well written book, despite a professional author being involved in producing it. The largest problem are Luttrell's political comments that blunt the force of this book. I'm not offended by them personally... I'm almost as much a right-wing lunatic as he is! My fear, however, is that the commentary may take this book out of \\"classic\\" war story category. If this book is somehow \\"dismissed\\" as right-wing commentary, it will severely deprive future generations of a heroic military story that's so very worthy of being told over and over. And who better to tell it than the man that lived it. I wish Luttrell had been advised to write a more understated book.
B000V86OKG|5.0|The smiling face of the box-set cover hardly reflects our heroe's ordeal throughout this second season.   First season had ended with the violent execution of his arch-enemy and infamous criminal - his own brother in fact - a necessity in Dexter's logic.   Second season opens on a sense of apeasement which is quickly shattered by the sudden discovery of a large number of body-bags off the coast of Miami. From then on Dexter pursues two missions. Number one mission: to rid himself of all those who try to link him directly or indirectly with the corpses - Seargeant Doakes primarily - who meets with his death at the hands of machiavelic Lila, and not Dexter's interestingly. Dexter's ordeal will come to an end with her own execution - in Paris bizarely when she is Brirish! - by her one time lover and inspirator, our hero himself. Number two mission: to carry on with his almost mystical trade, that of killing criminals who deserve their fates.    This second season sees a number of relationships enfolding or coming to an end: Dexter v Lila, Dexter v Rita and the kids, Deborah v FBI Agent Lundy, Angel v Lila, and Young Dexter v his foster father Harry Morgan.  Season ends with a sense of relief for Dexter; he can move on with his life. There is no one left to stand in his way and he can now show that smile of self-satiisfaction and fulfillement and achievement that can be seen on the box-set cover. A happy end somehow. But the menace is bound to lurk soon... since after all - and we must keep that in mind at all time - our hero though \\"a Dark Avenger\\" remains a killer of killers which no law can condone.

B00000D9TQ|5.0|Phil Collins' 'Hits' (1998) is a 16-track retrospective of his most popular solo releases, plus a cover of Cyndi Lauper's 'True Colors' included as the only new song on this CD. Although the songs do sound like they were made specifically for Adult Contemporary airtime, Phil brings power and feeling into his music - both in singing and in instrumentation - even if some 'critics' dare to say otherwise. Some songs like 'Don't Lose My Number' and 'Hang in Long Enough' are missing from this compilation, but the hits chosen here are more than enough of a bargain for those that love Phil's music. Recommended.
0061122416|1.0|If you liked this book, I appreciate your open-mindedness in reading this negative review. Also, a negative review can be helpful. I'll say this. It was an entertaining read, but--<br /><br />I enjoyed the first part of this morality tale (follow your dreams, a good message). But--but it was so bound up in the literal belief in omens. It is one thing to take opportunities, be daring, and strike out in new directions, but to march humanity back into the dark ages is something else.<br /><br />Hundreds of thousands of innocent people have died because of the belief in omens and other superstitions. The author of this book never addressed that essential question.<br /><br />I agree that we should follow our dreams, but this parable went too far overboard.<br /><br />I have traveled by bus and jeep across North Africa, and through Egypt and down through the Sudan, Ethiopia, and I can promise you that Mr. Coelho has romanticized nomadic life way out of realistic proportions.<br /><br />Also, the ending is old and predetermined from the beginning. The boy goes out searching for his dream and found it was back home all along. As a story, I would give it a higher rating, but the author really didn't deal with the hard problems of life.<br /><br />One critic said the \\"Little Prince\\" was a lot better. An Amazon reviewer of the \\"Little Prince\\" said that the narrator describes \\"his view of the world when he was a child and how adults could never understand the real meaning of things or perceive truth in the world--only the superficial and the usual. This is generally one of the main ideas of the book; \\"blessed are the children...\\". The rest of the book is the story of the little prince, whom the narrator discovers in the Sahara when he is trying to fix his downed airplane and is in fear of his life.\\"<br /><br />Sounds good. I think I'll read this classic of French literature.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is truly an enjoyable, delightful and charming romantic comedy.  Johnny Depp brings the essence of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin into this film through his character, Sam and does it in such a delightful and totally funny way.  His use of his eyes to express thoughts and feelings without words is also  fun to watch.  Aidan Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson turn in beautiful performances and the supporting cast is equally good and fun to watch.  I love this film and recommend it highly.  After watching the film, I thought how nice it would be if we all had a Sam in our lives.

B001DHXT2A|2.0|This movie, which I believe is supposed to be a sequel to the first starring Eric Bana, is weak. The creature doesn't have any of the \\"attributes\\" of the Eric Bana version like, he grows larger and stronger when made more angry, his leaping ability is cut way down in terms of distance. I mean, what the hell did they even make this flick for if they were gonna change aspects like those that basically \\"define\\" the creature's fury from the beginning. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the Tim Roth character steals the show from Edward Norton's weak display.
B0013URJTG|5.0|Porcupine Tree is an amazing band for this time and space - unafraid to mix heavy and ethereal to create masterworks that harken back to the early and mid-'70's when it was acceptable for heavy bands to include mellow material without being pummelled with rotten produce.<br />  This is the fault of the industry and fans' penchant for extreme categorization that restricts creativity and promotes blandness on a major scale.  So if a talented outfit like Porcupine Tree hope to be successful, it better pack the goods.<br />  Labeled progrock, which is not accurate, \\"Lightbulb Sun\\", like other releases, simmers, burns and caresses, but leaves you wanting more.  This CD is a little more spacey, ala \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\", and has much more to do with a space rock/heavy sound than any prog outfit, like the extremely dull Dream Theatre, or ELP or Yes.  PT do not deserve to be lumped in that banal category.<br />  No one track outshines another, and that's good, because then we get a complete work of art, not just a few singles and throwaways.  For those who love the old days of Blue Oyster Cult who expertly mixed heavy and melody better than just about anybody with a helping of Floydian influence, you can't do better, unless you maybe check out Opeth, equally diverse and intertwined with PT, both Mikael Akerfeldt and Steve Wilson being frequent collaboraters.  Maybe a Wilson/Akerfeldt project will be out sometime, and that will be huge.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|Once in a while a movie comes along that rejuvinates my motivation to become a director and gives me hope that movies are not a dead medium. This is one of those movies. Perfectly crafted starting at the casting of  Adrian Brody, Owen Wilson and Jason Scwartzman. They all play outstanding roles of Brothers who meet up on a Toutist Train in India after a long hiatus from seeing each other to venture on a spiritual journey to see thier estranged mother.    The choice for this movie to take place entirely in India (minus the flashback) was a wonderful selection. India acts as the fourth main character in this movie with its beautiful architecture and interesting inhabitants.  The Colorful backdrops and culture make this movie what it is.    Offbeat humor and wry remarks make this a funny but not hillarious movie, as with most wes anderson movies. This is not a movie that tries hard to make you laugh, you either get it or you don't.    Wes Anderson accurately captures the emotional distance that often occurs when you reunite with people youve known your whole life and dont have much to say to each other and the problems that arise when you have no other choice.    The highlight of the movie to most is the flashback in the garage in New York. Perfectly executed and well timed by all three actors. The soundtrack is superb as well. One of the best movies Ive seen all year.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|I've been through four copies (an 8-track, two vinyl records, and a CD) of this disc.  I just play it over and over.  There really is nothing else like it in the electric guitar canon of Hendrix, Page, Van Halen:  although Jimi gave jaw-dropping performances, he didn't have the extreme facility with a guitar that EVH has.  Page, of course, was prone to sloppy play, both live and on record.  His work also suffers from the crude state of the effects and recording technology available to him at the time.  Eddie Van Halen, on the other hand, is master of every component of rock musicianship.<br /><br />I think one must divide rock guitar history into \\"Pre-Van Halen\\" and \\"Post-Van Halen.\\" Yes, [[ASIN:B00004Y6O9 Van Halen]] is surely the starting point.  People began copying Eddie as soon as they heard \\"Eruption.\\"  For two decades after that, rock radio was dominated by EVH wannabes, some of them very accomplished and successful.  His influence cannot be missed in the latest rock recordings even now.  Not only are his signature techniques now staples of rock soloing, but he completely remade rhythm guitar.  And this album shows what all the hoopla was about.<br /><br />Has there ever been an album with so many catchy tunes on which the guitarist, not the singer, was so clearly the center of the band?  \\"Unchained\\" is a great song, for example, and \\"Sinners Swing!\\" is infectious, but what's most prominent here is that the guitarist is a genius.  It just oozes from every track.<br /><br />I first saw the band on the \\"Fair Warning\\" tour.  I bought the tickets as a favor to my brother without caring for these guys at all.  Ever since that night, I've been hooked.  If you don't know Van Halen, listen to \\"Fair Warning.\\"  Then you'll get it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I could watch this over and over-- it gets better with every viewing.  Not only are the songs amazing, but the DVD commentary may be the best I've ever heard!  Genius!  WELL worth picking up the DVD for the commentary alone.  I'm going to go watch it again right now...

B0000DBJDM|1.0|Don't get me wrong. The original release of Pink Floyd At Pompeii is amazing. Legendary. What's been done in the name of a \\"Director's Cut\\" is nothing short of blasphemy. Lousy, pointless 80's style graphics and some innocuous interview material that should have been added as an extra - not part of the movie. (In the original release there were some behind-the-scenes footage of the band recording Dark Side Of The Moon --- that material worked well in the context of the film.) Oh and don't even get me started about the cropping of the material from 1.33:1 to 16:9. Just Plain Awful!    If the original cut had been released I would have given it FIVE stars - even with 2.0 sound. To make matters worse, the description makes it sound as though the original release is included as an extra but it's not the original release - just the original 'concert' footage. If you're a major fan of the movie (like me) you'd be happier finding a VHS version of the movie.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|\\"Black Christmas\\" is an original, innovative holiday slasher flick that influenced countless imitations, including John Carpenter and Debra Hill's highly successful \\"Halloween.\\"  Directed by the versatile Bob Clark (director of the zombie horror hit \\"Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things\\" as well as the heartwarming family comedy \\"A Christmas Story\\"), \\"Black Christmas\\" is a  Canadian horror gem that has its own cult following and a website:  ItsMeBilly.com.  Though it never spawned a sequel, a successful remake was released in 2006.<br /><br />  The plot is chilling, suspenseful, and realistic.  A few days before Christmas, an unknown psychopath sneaks into the attic of a sorority house.  He makes obscene phone calls that terrify the residents.  One girl (Claire Harrison played by Lynne Griffin of \\"Curtains\\") is suffocated with a dry cleaning bag and her corpse seated in a rocking chair in the attic.  She remains there throughout the storyline, unknown to those below.<br /><br />  The viewer never sees the killer's face.  All we learn about him is that his name is Billy and he had a sister named Agnes.  He may have killed her.  Before killing a victim, he refers to her as \\"Agnes.\\"<br /><br />  The cast is great.  John Saxon (\\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\") is Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller who is investigating Claire's disappearance.  Olivia Hussey (\\"Psycho IV\\") is the pregnant heroine, Jessica Bradford, who is terrorized by her angry boyfriend, Peter Smythe (Keir Dullea).  Seventies scream queen Margot Kidder (\\"Sisters\\" and \\"The Reincarnation of Peter Proud\\") is the depressed alcoholic student, Barb Coard.  Art Hindle (of David Cronenberg`s \\"The Brood\\") is Claire's worried boyfriend, Chris Hayden.  Andrea Martin (\\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\") is the only actor to star in the 2006 remake.  Playing a student, Phyllis Carlson, in the original, Martin returns in the remake as the sorority housemother.<br /><br />  \\"Black Christmas\\" is a creepy, atmospheric horror slasher with a downbeat, open ending; it reminded me of the ending in \\"The House on Sorority Row.\\"  \\"Black Christmas\\" is a must see for fans of holiday slasher fare and slasher flicks in general.  It is definitely a holiday horror classic.  Watch it back to back with the remake for an interesting perspective on how horror films have evolved over the past thirty years.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!

The pressure is on.<br /><br />Actually paper engineering was Charles specialty, my teacher long appreciated. His lessons there among others I treasure. The designing is lovely. The book should be, especially at this price, considered for a child near you or a designer in the wings. It's a real value. I'm getting another for a child I love.
0743454537|5.0|I really like how Jodi Picoult writes her books - her storylines and concepts to me are always unique and are wonderful starting points for a story.  And this book has to be one of the best in the concept - having a child to donate organs to another child.    The book goes on to develop the charactors well and when you think you find someone either empathtic or intolreable due to their behvior, there is something around the corner which adds depth to them and pulls at you and you remotions.    I am not sure if it is quite as well written as some of her other books, but the storyline is so engrossing that it is a minor point to raise at all.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|If you're a vampire legend fan this is a must see. With an all star cast, sets, music, direction and costumes to boot, this is about a close as you're going to get to the real tale of the Prince of Darkness.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is outstanding as the old and young Vlad Tepes III (Dracula) and Sir Anthony Hopkins is at his usual best as Professor Van Helsing. Keano reeves and Winona Ryder are great as the two lovers stalked by the count...<br /><br />What makes this DVD set even more fantastic is the bonus DVD that take you behind the scenes and into the making of this epic historical and fictional account of how love can transcend good and evil...Francis Ford Coppola and his son explain in great detail how many of the visual effects but more importantly the thinking, skill and artistry behind the making of this classic. What most of us would pass off as computer generated effects were, in fact, painstakingy crafted actual set pieces and old fashioned film making techniques applied to modern day cinematography of a centuries old tale. The result is visually breathtaking, errie, sensual and often terrifying scenes that bring you right into the world of the living battling among the undead.<br /><br />Once you see the behind the scenes DVD you'll appreciate even more the true artistry that went into the realism of this classic.<br /><br />PN
B000WD66BM|5.0|This is easily the best second album of any band I have ever heard! I'm a little biased because I'm a fan of the band and have heard nearly all of their songs. My favorite songs by far would be \\"Nightquest\\" , which is heavy and melodic. \\"Devil & The Deep Dark Ocean\\" is the heaviest and most theatrical track on the album. Tapio Wilska's voice is used to maximum efficiency. His growling compared to Tarja'a soprano vocals are absolutely flawless. America's bands simply cannot compete (It's mostly crap anyway) This album is worth the price!

1594201927|4.0|Highly neutral in opinion and straight-to-the-point lecture, it's a classic of basic knowledge about something I hardly understood - money! Till today when I purchased the item to enjoy during the holiday season. No better present, or I'd rather say using the advanced terminology borrowed from the book \\"investment\\" - could I do for pleasure of contemplating various stories connected to the ascent of money. Let's say one of them - the history of the mighty Rothschild family.         Perfect chronology of the most important discoveries implemented to the world's financial system, the role of money in the global policy or dramas of ordinary people who had come to the bankruptcy makes the book a valuable guide what to do especially today during tne global financial crisis.

B0018M6J90|4.0|A movie with a score and storyline reminiscent of the JEEVES AND WOOSTER adaptations of P.G. Woodhouse's classic series made for the BBC, MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY is a delightful film, even if it is misstitled (more on that to follow). Set in pre-WWII London, the protagonist Miss Pettigrew, \\"a governess of last resort,\\" finds herself without work, hungry, and on the street with nothing but the clothes on her back. Frances McDormand is perfectly cast as the wholesome protagonist whose main virtues are an unflappable honesty and common sense.<br /><br />Forced by the desperate nature of her circumstance, she impersonates a Social Secretary hired by the glamorous but silly Delysia, a wanna-be starlet played by Amy Adams. Involved with no less than three men, she is the exact opposite of the world weary Miss Pettigrew. Though unsure about the morals of her new employer, Miss Pettigrew has no choice but to continue the ruse, lest she end up back on the street.<br /><br />What follows is a series of entertaining subterfuges deftly navigated by Miss Pettigrew's charm, quick thinking, and human decency. Frances McDormand is perfect for the role, able to capture both the protagonist's wistful desire for elements of the glamor lifestyle (nice clothes, good food, a sure place to sleep for the night) as well as her disdain for the pettiness and loose morals of those who posses them.<br /><br />Throughout, Miis Pettigrew is remarkably likable; the viewer cannot help but align with her and hope for her success, even if it means the success of other less likable characters. She is also the deepest character, and this is why I think the movie is very misstitled. The implication of the title is that only now, amidst the fancy things and extravagant lifestyles of the other characters is Miss Pettigrew really living. To the contrary it seems that it is other characters who have much more to learn from her than she them. I understand that a good title doesn't necessarily have to relate to the film itself (Fargo, another Frances McDormand film comes to mind), but in this case the title seems disingenuous to the real message of the film.<br /><br />The dialogue sings it is so well written and intelligently witty (at one point, the not-so-bright starlet Delysia accuses Miss Pettigrew of 'dressing like Oliver Twist's mother). If only all the actors could keep up. Amy Adams over acts through most of the film, but does gain back some ground in her final few lines of dialogue. The male leads are mostly archetypes and were not given many real opportunities to shine; most of the funniest lines were reserved for the girls in this one.<br /><br />The film really takes off in the third act when the seriousness of the characters' different plights are juxtaposed with an impending war. Bombers in the London sky and air raid sirens interrupting dancing at a club bring grim counterbalance and needed depth to the story. Through these brief glimpses of the world outside the narrative of the film, we see the backbone of Miss Pettigrew, and learn that she is much more than just a failed governess turned impostor Social Secretary.<br /><br />At first seemingly a period comedy with better than average writing but turning out to be much more substantial, the film is quite funny and more than a little touching, and deserves the accolades it has received. Frances McDormand is a treasure, and is easily the best part of the film. Well worth owning.self (Fargo, another Frances McDormand film comes to mind), but in this case the title seems disingenuous to the real message of the film.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|The story in this movie is entertaining though if you don't like music, don't bother.   But I do love music and have been searching for a reason to sing again. The music on this is exactly what i needed to hear. It's almost angelic to me; the harmonies are so good. The words spark my intellect. Glen's vocals are absolutely strong and solid. He makes me want to sing out as much as listening to Marketa does.  Thanks to everyone who made their albums possible! I am a new supporter of this groups work and will do my best to share the experience.

1592289444|5.0|Anyone who buys this book will be interested in the main theme - the unbelievable trek made by the group of escaped prisonors, but there is plenty more on which to reflect.     The book opens with the author's arrest and brutal interrogation. During this phase he survives by sheer will power and in the knowledge of his innocense.  But later when he and fellow prisoners escape, a subtle change begins.  More and more as hardships and tragedies take their toll, it is the bond of the group that keeps them going.  I won't reveal the closing lines of the book but they highlight that value as well.     As we journey through life, most of us are surprised when we experience suffering or injustice.  The bitterness of such experiences can harden some into cynicism and drive others to despair.  But the underlying message I found in this book is that we are not supposed to, and indeed cannot, make the journey alone.  In caring for the survival and welfare of others, we ourselves survive and are cared for.
0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper was the first Jodi Picoult's book I have read and it led me to read other Picout's books. The great thing about My Sister's Keeper is that it is a page turning book, has a great plot, characters, and the pivot at the end of the story. This book is mainly about a girl named Anna, a custom born baby, to help her sister survive who is suffering from leukemia. However, Anna is growing up and she doesn't want to donate her body parts to her sister. Therefore she provides herself an attorney and sues her parents. Later, Anna realizes the point of her life and gives up on the case.   Picoult has arranged the story in a very unique way by alternating the speaker of the story in each chapter showing every main characters' thinking and their point of view. I would recommend this book a lot because it is such a heartwarming story and you can feel the sympathy for the family.

B000FGGE68|5.0|I see that this movie is being compared with Aeon Flux - wrongly in my opinion, because \\"Ultraviolet\\" shows what can be done when you allow a real actress to do her work without interference, unlike the failed Aeon Flux where the producers seem to have subverted their entire movie to their anti technology message.  Ultraviolet is a movie with a real plot, set in a realistic projected future and with real characterizations, a movie with real music, real acting, a simple plot yet with many convolutions.<br /><br />Visually the CGI of Ultraviolet somehow makes it more \\"real\\" than the staged and overly fussed unrealistic Aeon Flux stagings.  Mila Jovavich brings a focused, intense performance in which both rage and emotional sensitivity lurk just beneath the surface of her enhanced but time limited precarious existence.<br /><br />The movie will need to be seen several times but the underlying theme of resistance against future political repression, in the form of a symbolized fantasy, and objectified and concretized from that abstraction by the forcefullness and precision of Jovavich's fine acting, all add up to a movie which has become an unexpected gem on a beach strewn with rubble like Flux.  Jovavich is the troubled heroine, transcending her own limitations to attain her goals, with or without the help of anyone, a heroine of the future in a world which, like that of today, is maintained by forces which seek to dehumanize us all as human \\"resources\\" and genetic types.<br /><br />I am certain there are some who will disagree violently with my review.  Everyone must watch this masterpiece and decide for themselves.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Although i do not have any knowledge about the comic book this movie is based on, i can still confidently say that it has done justice to it. The camera work and special effects done in this movie were mind-boggling not to mention the best car/train chases i have seen. It lives up to the name action-flick in the sense that the action NEVER stops from start to finish. Story-line is somewhat redundant but it is based on a comic book therefore the basic elements have to be there.<br />All in all a great addition to the action movie genre, my only regret is that Angelina Jolie did not have much to say, where did her lines go???

B000WGWQG8|3.0|I was anticipating this series as something inspirational and informative of American history.  I was hugely disappointed.  Only the second of the seven episodes came close to meeting my expectations---I would probably rate it four stars.  Episodes 1, 3, 6, and 7 were mixed, with some good elements and some bad, while episodes 4 and 5 were awful.<br /><br />Historically, it's for the most part more or less in the ballpark.  However, there are many details that have to be included in a movie like this that simply are not knowable from the historical record---much of the dialogue, a given person's demeanor at a particular time, etc., are of necessity a matter of interpretation for the filmmakers, and they have invariably chosen to present the facts in the worst possible way.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the acting.  Giamatti's interpretation of Adams as basically an insecure and petulant child driven by his emotions who flies into violent rages at the slightest provocation is extremely irritating.  Jefferson is portrayed from the beginning as strangely aloof.  After the death of his wife, this detachment becomes morbidly morose for the rest of the series---it's like something out of Interview With the Vampire.<br /><br />The filmmakers seem to be doing their best to present the American Founders and Adams in particular as vain, pompous, mean, petty, and mundane.  There are scenes of Adams preparing manure, brushing his teeth, shingling his roof, and so on.  There is nothing wrong with historical accuracy, of course, or painting a picture of what life was like in the 18th century so long as it's well-integrated into the main story---but there is something very wrong with anyone who would pay $50 to watch John Adams brushing his teeth, not to mention with filmmakers who couldn't think of anything more significant or important to do with the time devoted to that scene.<br /><br />Aesthetically, the series is mixed.  The costumes, sets, etc. are excellent---but the cinematography is almost bizarre in places.  There are many shots at extreme tilted angles or wobbling, for no apparent reason---shots that would fit right in in a Hitchcock picture, but this is a biopic of John Adams, for crying out loud!  More than once a shot is framed with the actor to the far side of the screen, with three-quarters of the frame practically empty---again, for no good reason.  It's as though it was being shot by a student filmmaker who was trying too hard to be \\"artsy,\\" and this imposition of post-modern aesthetic sensibilities onto early modern subject matter is distractingly out of place.<br /><br />The overall tone of the series is extremely negative.  The filmmakers seem determined to undercut any of Adams' positive achievements.  The episode in which he wins the election to become the second president ends with a shot of him sitting dejectedly in a corner of the presidential mansion, which has been looted by servants after Washington's departure; the episode in which he manages to avert war with France ends with the death of his alcoholic son; and so on.<br /><br />In short, HBO's \\"John Adams\\" is manifestly unjust to its subject.  It's also highly overrated.  I have not read the book upon which this series was supposedly based, though I have read several other of David McCullough's books and for the most part enjoyed them.  Like most contemporary popular historians and biographers, he injects his personal bias into the material, though he is not as bad as many others in this regard even if he does somehow manage to slant in every direction at once.  Still, I doubt that the filmmakers' treatment of the material can be attributed to the author.  Don't waste your money on this movie---at most, get it from the library and watch the first two or three episodes, and skip the rest---without having read it, I'd make an educated guess that the book has to be a better bet for your money.in places.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|I will be the first to readily admit that I slept on Radiohead's IN RAINBOWS throughout 2008.  I originally had planned to buy the album online via Radiohead's infamous download offer (which of course worked adversely against them) but I missed the deadline.  I then purchased IN RAINBOWS in the store conventionally, but I only listened to the first couple of tracks and sat it aside.  It was one of those albums that I said 'I would eventually listen to and critique'.  After putting it off for almost an entire year, the Grammy nominations reignited my interest in IN RAINBOWS, considering the gracious Album of the Year award. I will also be the first to say that I thought that an Album of the Year nomination was a bit lofty for this album, but after listening to it and analyzing it, I can sympathize with the Recording Academy's mindset and thinking.  It is a fine album. Maybe not 2008's Album of the Year, but certainly a worthy contender by all means.<br /><br />The album opens as mysterious as any Radiohead album, only this time with sick electronic programming (drums) that instantly catch the listener's attention. Indeed, opening ditty \\"15 Steps\\" is not only a great opener, but a personal favorite of mine from IN RAINBOWS. I mean, who else writes in 5/4 time conventionally? Yorke sounds as solid as he did on OK COMPUTER, a historical album.  The guitar work complements both the drum programming and live drums. \\"Bodysnatchers\\" opts for a more 'indie-/garage-rock' sound than \\"15 Steps\\". The guitar work is heavy, though tasteful-enough allowing for Yorke's vocals to shine through the arrangement. It too is a great listen and the mixing job is superb. So far, Radiohead is batting 1000.<br /><br />\\"Nude\\" is definitely in my top 3 of tracks from IN RAINBOWS. The synth-strings coupled with vocalized-synth sounds make it one of the most immaculate productions of IN RAINBOWS.  Here, Yorke's vocals sound as sincere as they ever have.  The chord progression as always is out there, one of Radiohead's most redeeming qualities.  As a songwriter myself, it is difficult to exit from the restrains of I-IV-V chordal progressions - Radiohead has no problems in this arena as \\"Nude\\" and the rest of IN RAINBOWS proves true.  \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" continues and upward streak of solid tracks, though it is not my favorite by any means (solid nonetheless). \\"All I Need\\" is equally as strong as anything else, with a bass line that any pop/hip-hop/urban producer would kill to have.  On \\"All I Need\\", the songwriting evolves as more electronic effects are added making for quite a stimulating listen. Top notch Radiohead by all means.<br /><br />\\"Faust Arp\\" features one of the most intellectualized chordal progressions of IN RAINBOWS.  Again, sounds run rampant and Yorke eats it up with his phenomenal vocals. Another contender in my top three for best track from IN RAINBOWS is most certain \\"Reckoner\\" with its top-notch songwriting, great guitar work, and multi-layered drums. Second only to \\"Nude\\" is this Yorke's greatest vocal performance.  \\"House of Cards\\" provides another solid Radiohead performance, while \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\" is another 5-star performance in my eyes.  Radiohead ends on a high note with \\"Video Tape\\", even if it falls short of the very strongest of the album. Even saying that, \\"Video Tape\\" is 110% solid as well.<br /><br />Essentially, Radiohead does not make a misstep on IN RAINBOWS, save for their 'downloading' fiasco, which my have prevented the album from going platinum (it went gold).  But what is commercial success these days? If an album goes gold it has accomplished something with the current state of the recording industry and the totality of the economy itself.  Radiohead have proven to me that they did have one of the best albums of 2008 and I nearly passed up a golden listening opportunity by my foolishness.  4 ½ Stars!!!iohead's most redeeming qualities.

Harrison Ford just doesn't quit and looks incredible for his age, I hope that I age that well.

B000002KGT|5.0|over and over again.  Some things just get better with age and Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours' is one of them.  Some of the songs are haunting, some upbeat, but every one on this CD is superb.    Fleetwood Mac has that special combination of ingredients that made for solid gold.  I hate to say that the day of great music like this has come and gone, but where has music like this gone?      Get this CD, relax, and kick back and remember or discover for the first time what real music is.  This is a classic for the ages!

And, it's one of his movies easily available in the states with a happy ending.  (Hope I didn't give it away, but that only means he's still alive at the end!)    There are a few scenes in the movie version that are out of order and change the meaning from the book.  I understand that to make a good movie, some creative license must be allowed.  Over all a great romance.  You always know who you're rooting for.  I highly recommend it.
0441009425|4.0|Revelation Space is the first novel in a series of books by Alastair Reynolds.  In this book we are introduced to some key aspects of a human civilization several hundred years in the future.  Humanity has expanded outward to several hundred different solar systems, inventing new technology along the way, but still traveling in ships that are limited by the speed of light and therefore affected by time dilation.  That time dilation plays a major role in how the story unfolds.    The story revolves around several different sets of players.  One of these is Dan Sylveste a man obsessed with finding out the answers to why a recently discovered civilization known as the Amarantin were destroyed in an event almost a million years in the past.  The core of the plot revolves around finding the answers to the questions surrounding that event.    Reynolds skillfully interweaves several different plotlines into a manageable whole that keeps the book moving along, but at the same time, as others have noticed, the ending feels a bit rushed.  There is a lot of plot development pointing to a big idea and that big idea in the end is pretty neat, but considering the whole book leads up to that revelation (pun unintended) it doesn't quite meet expectations.  A comparison could be made to a book like Hyperion by Dan Simmons where the big ideas come together in a very satisfying conclusion, even if we don't get all the answers.  In this case we don't get all the answers (since there are some unexplored mysteries left to other books as in Hyperion as well), but what we do get doesn't quite measure up to the build up sustained in the 500+ pages leading up to it.    Not that Revelation Space isn't a very good novel overall with plenty to enjoy, but it doesn't quite reach the intended level of awe that it hopes for in the end.  Still, definitely worth the read and overall very entertaining.
B000R4SMD6|5.0|\\"Even a broken clock is right, twice a day.\\"  Such are the zingers that Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) tosses at Willy Beachum, very young deputy D.A.  This movie is a brilliant psychological thriller.  Ted is convinced that he has executed the perfect crime.  He readily confesses to shooting his wife, who he has caught in an affair. He is convinced his confession will be thrown out on technicalities.  He is so convinced that he even attempts to serve as his own counsel for the trial.  The person that he has caught his wife with adds even more intrigue to the movie, and he makes sure the person is there when the body is discovered so that he can see the look of anguish on the guy's face.  The wife is not dead, however, and on life support in a coma.  The young prosecutor knows he is losing badly and spends hours at her bedside hoping to revive her so she can name the shooter.  Ted loves the game of cat and mouse with the young attorney, and feels that Willy is so cocky, he will trap himself up.  The finale of the movie is worth the wait.  Ted is so diabolically clever at every turn, covering all of the bases, but there are two little details he has forgotten.  One concerns the double jeaopardy clause, and the other is in underestimating Willy's abilities.  The movie is wonderful, but even more enjoyable with some fava beans and a little Chianti.

B0017ANAZO|4.0|I watched this film without making comparisons to the earlier version, and there were so many wonderful comedic actresses in this film - Candice Bergen was a particular standout - that the slightness of the story line was not a problem. A film with Annette Bening, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, Cloris Leachman, Ana Gasteyer, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Debbie Mazar, and Debra Messing gives one an awful lot of talent to enjoy.<br /><br />In little ways, there is a \\"Sex and the City\\" vibe (although there is no sex in this film).  Bening's magazine-editor character does have some Cynthia-Nixon-ish mannerisms, and Jada Pinkett-Smith's author-character reminded me at times of SATC's Carrie Bradshaw, that is, if Carrie had been a gorgeous black lesbian. But that is where the resemblances end.<br /><br />And Eva Mendes, as the villainess of the piece (a Saks Fifth Avenue perfume counter shopgirl), has features that make her a Julia Roberts for the 21st century - all big doe eyes, and a 2000 megawatt smile.<br /><br />This film is fluff, but if you're fans of these actresses, you might like to watch this - possibly with your girlfriends.
B00008WT5C|5.0|AC/DC's 1977 release, \\"Let There Be Rock\\", is one of the best AC/DC albums they've ever made for one reason, Its good high voltage rock n roll with no stopping and non stop rocking, and more... Let There Be Rock is filled with pounding drums, great guitar riffs, and cool singing which makes this album a must have for a rock fan. This album starts off with the bluesy, \\"Go Down\\", which by its name you can obviously tell what it's about.... Go Down opens this album and has a great riff, Its a good song that they can jam on, great song. Then the album rolls on too track two, \\"Dog Eat Dog\\", another cool AC/DC song with a great riff, and one of the only AC/DC songs too contain different drumming besides the basic rock beat. Dog Eat Dog is another AC/DC song that is often forgotten about along with, \\"Go Down\\". Things then really start rocking on track three, \\"Let There Be Rock\\" which is the albums main song and title. Let There Be Rock has probaly the best riff on this whole album and is the best song on the whole album because of what its about and that its just a great rocking song. To prove how intense the song Let There Be Rock is during the recording of it Angus Young's amplifier caught on fire midway through recording of the song yet the producers told him too keep on playing, by the time the song was over the amp head was a melted pile of wires. Things just keep rocking on this album with the fourth track, \\"Bad Boy Boogie\\", which contains another great riff too it and beat. Another classic AC/DC song and contains probaly the second best riff on the whole album. Then the fifth track, \\"Problem Child\\" was actullay released on the album, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, but was for some reason re realeased on this album.... Still a great song with a great riff. Then the six song, \\"Overdose\\", is another one of those early forgotten AC/DC songs but is still a great song. It contains a weird guitar intro too it but quickly gets into the main part of the song with another great riff, but unfortantley that song is another forgotten AC/DC song. Then the seventh song, \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\", was a concert staple for AC/DC in the late 70s along with, Let There Be Rock, Bad Boy Boogie, and Problem Child, anyways back to the point. Hell Aint A Bad Place To Be also contains another great riff and is just a good AC/DC song. Then the final track Whole Lotta Rosie is another AC/DC live concert staple even today, contains a cool riff and for once a different drum beat. All in all AC/DC's Let There Be Rock you cannot miss and at just nine dollars it is defently worth the money.riff, but unfortantley that song is another forgotten AC/DC song.

B001CFLHJA|4.0|To me, listening to music is a particular activity that one chooses to do.  In other words, I don't typically turn on the radio or put on a CD just to have noise to accompany some task that I'm doing.  Much of what passes for contemporary jazz seems to be designed to be such background music.  The songs are long and dull.    Aaron Parks' Invisible Cinema is neither of these.  It's fast-paced, and the instrumental work by all of the participants is very interesting.  I enjoy sitting down to listen to it.  Could there be higher praise for a CD?
B0001NBMEE|4.0|A huge fan of both Hal Foster's original strip and of this movie despite all it's changes to the mythos of Prince Valiant, I can only add one comment at this time: The DVD transfer once again seems to be from a lackluster print, as I noticed with John Ford's \\"The Quiet Man\\".  I love these big colorful cinemascope pictures and I can only hope that as we move into the HD world, new prints will be struck from the negative and we can get a good transfer of such favorites as \\"Prince Valiant\\" and \\"The Quiet Man\\".

B001AXME2S|5.0|Title says it all, this is just a fantastic piece of work. Its a little more mellow than there old stuff, but just a great album. One of the few albums you can listen all the way through and love every song! A must have for your collection!
031606792X|5.0|Im am a Tri-hard...Aboslutly hooked since book one, soon to be sporting a twilight tat..Breaking Dawn was great..Starting with Bella and Edwards wedding i love that..short and sweet just the way i was hoping it would be.Jake was of course acting like an a** at the obviousness of Bella and Edward consumating their wedding..Then the honey moon..I thought that Stephenie could have wrote it better without being to straight forward, Richelle Mead did that excellent in \\"Shadow Kiss\\"..Other than the very breif sex scene the rest was great..And VERY unexpected.Rose was really pissing me off as usual..I acually enjoyed Jakes point of veiw.With him becoming an alpha and his interaction with the Cullens was great, and funny because of his treatment of Rose.Seeing Edward so stricken was nuts and really desperate.It just showed how much he really loved Bella.The touching scene when Edward hears the baby is great.Then the birth of Renesmeme was crazy.I love her name.At first i was like \\"WHAT THE HECK IS THAT\\", but the named slowly grew on me once i could pronounce it correctly.Nessie is the perfect child.She's so smart and talented and i love everything about her.Vampire Bella was just sooooo tight.Reading from a vampire point of veiw was very interesting.Haveing a new strong Bella was great.Her control for blood was excellent as i knew would probably happen, and Jaspers reaction was funny.The Jake and Nessie thing makes sense, but ut threw me.Quil and Clare were cute together.Anyway the cover to breaking Dawn is very appropriate.The games of wills/powers at the end had me on my seat.Some people wanted there to actually be a fight but im glad there wasnt because had there been a Cullen would have most likely died and i really wouldnt be able to take that.I dont love Rose as much as the others, but without her Em wouold be crushed. I love them all and i love this book..Its a definite must read..The whole series is just 1#.
0545128285|4.0|This book was really interesting because although it worked for what it was (a book of fairytales with commentary from Dumbledore), and although I found it relatively interesting and liked learning more about the Wizarding World, the fact remainds that I never would have read something like this if it wasn't related to Harry Potter.<br /><br />Fans of Harry Potter will like it. Especially the \\"Tales of Three Borthers\\" which is directly related to book 7. But if your not a fan, then I wouldn't bother. The best bit for me was Lucius Malfoy's letter to Dumbledore.
1595141979|5.0|Okay..DO NOT read this book if you havent read the first two which are great..If you do you really wont catch the right emotions..I loved the portrayal of Rose, and the \\"issues\\" she was having being shadow kissed.She grew up in the last book with what happened at the end, and if shows.I love the relationship between Demetri and her.Also in my mind the only person who comes before Demetri is Edward Cullen from Twilight and thats a huge compliment compared to how much i love Edward..Demetri stole a peice of my heart and Richelle wrote him beautifully..The relationship between Lissa and Rose took an serious turn,also Roses relationship with her mother improved,and bascically loved this book!!!!Oh and to add more drama Victor is back( the morori who is Lissa's family and trys to kidnap her to abuse her spirit power)and he's on trial, this leads to some serious Demetri&Rose time..Blood Promise should be great, maybe it can give me hope for what happened at the end of Shadow Kiss...
B00129H7VS|5.0|Even if you have the DVD set...get the Blu Ray version.  The DVD extras are cool but the Blu Ray extras take it to a whole new level.  While playing the episodes you can either have video commentary from Easy Company which really adds to the scenes (great if you have seen the episodes multiple times...) -or- you can have a field guide timeline that displays facts at certain points...really informative and awesome supplement to the episodes.  I have seen the series several times so the new features really add to the experience, they also fill in gaps that make certain scenes make complete sense.  Great gift - I recieved the DVD set for Christmas in 2003 and was my cherished present for years.  Got the Blu Ray set for Christmas 2008 and renewed that feeling!    Really, I don't think a series has come out since Band of Brothers that has captured my attention like this has.  I watched all 10 episodes over the course of a week with my Grandpa who is a WWII vet...he couldn't wait for me to get home so we could watch another episode.  He stated he had not seen a movie that captured the authenticity of the War like Band of Brothers.

I sat down and read a couple pages.At first i thought kinda immediate but i continued and i loved it.

0956010903|5.0|This is an awesome replica of the original hand-written book by Ms. Rowling.  Personally, I think her handwriting is a bit tough to read and was relieved that they changed to the more \\"Potteresque\\" font after the introduction.  It cost a hundred bucks, not the millions Amazon paid for one of the seven original copies.  For a Collector's Edition of this complexity (all those little pieces to put on the cover with their inset faux moonstones, the matching clasp, the velvet drawstring bag with embroidered signature, the prints - in an envelope - TUCKED INTO A SPECIAL POCKET INSIDE THE FRONT COVER OF THE CASE!)... That's a lot of work going into a single product.  You can't honestly expect absolute perfection for a mere $100.00       I just received mine this evening and read it straight through.  I thoroughly enjoyed the stories, but it is the book itself that has me awed.  Check out the photos Amazon has of the original that it purchased at auction and compare yours to theirs.  Close enough to the original that I think we all got off pretty easy only paying $100.00 (the net proceeds of which go to an excellent children's charity, as noted in the back of the book).      And if the repetition of the word \\"flames\\" bothers you, grab a blue pen and slip a coma between them.  Now, don't you feel better?    In conclusion, I say, \\"Thanks Amazon and Ms. Rowling.  I love it!\\"

B001DDBCUK|4.0|Taken at face value, the movie is seriously flawed. Carrie, Samantha and Miranda make unreasonable demands on their significant others. Samantha and Carrie don't understand when their spouses have to work late. Miranda doesn't have time for Steve (but she has time to go off to Mexico with the girls and help Carrie move). They whine a lot and don't listen to their partners. The men (especially \\"Big\\") are...well, nice. We don't see a lot of male ego.<br /><br />Then there's the lack of mundane reality. Carrie is supposed to be a writer but she lives the lifestyle of an entertainer. And so on.<br /><br />But SATC was always about fantasy. The show always exaggerated. Remember Carrie's book party? The fashions were always over the top. The women never had families. New York was like an extra character in the show -- ab beautiful city that these women enjoyed to the fullest. And except for Samantha's bout with cancer, nobody really suffered.<br /><br />So...once you're willing to suspend disbelief and see the movie as mildly amusing satire, it's a lot of fun, with some old-fashioned sentiment mixed in (the New Year's Eve montage of improbably lonely people). The plot is driven by coincidences and accident, not strong characters. I'd have liked to see more of Sanford Blatch and the wedding planner. I wish all the subplots didn't involve the same type of relationship issues; the TV episodes were more creative. We could have done without the \\"bathroom humor.\\" The Jennifer Hudson character was likeable and cute but not strong or funny.<br /><br />What makes this DVD 4-stars rather than 3 is Michael King's commentary. He loves the characters and the actors. I think he's a little bit in love with Sarah Jessica Parker.  He points out nuances and symbols I missed the first time around. He manages to suggest a show that has some substance underneath the fluff.<br /><br />Most of all he points out, the show doesn't end the way we would expect. I liked that. I liked seeing the women aging. There's a shot of Carrie looking totally distressed, every line carved into her face.<br /><br />It could have been worse. A lot worse. Time to say good-by to an innovative TV concept and move, with the characters, into a new stage of life.oking totally distressed, every line carved into her face.     It could have been worse.

B00005LKHV|5.0|Sure, it's a dumb movie about guys who want to get laid, but it does invent several characters that you really do begin to care about, so how can you really fault it? The gags are really quite funny, and it's hard to imagine any other situation where a girl could convince her dad that \\"there was nothing going on\\" by screaming at the top of her lungs \\"I'M COMING!!!!\\" Another phrase that will never be the same for met again is \\"There was this one time at Band Camp...\\" The infamous American pie scene is, of course, quite disgusting, but if it had been shared with anyone other than Eugene Levy...
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|Nearly indescribable with the English language, how awful this movie is.  I won't belabor what other reviewers have said so well; but, for my own two cents, the thing that most destroys this piece is CASTING.  Meryl Streep is insane beyond belief as the mother of the bride.  Grandmother, maybe; she looks so old in this film that her very first appearance on screen ruins everything before and after.  Streep's face looks like a leather glove with two slits for eyes; apparently, too much cosmetic surgery has tightened her skin until it has pulled her eyes back into small slots.  I became a slightly nauseous at having to look at that face on-screen over the course of the film.  Streep's ancient look made everything else absurd- her former lovers look like her children in comparison, and from the apparent age of her \\"daughter\\" in the film, her character would have had to have given birth in her mid-70's.  I am with many other reviewers who marvel at how writers and directors can take top notch actors, music, and scenery and throw it all away, creating a horrific and, if there is any mercy in the world, a quickly forgettable moment in cinema madness.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Wow, blast to the past. Jon Feder in this movie reminds me a lot of one of my ex-colleagues (in a good way), which makes watching this quite strange. Napoleon's eccentricities are all so amazingly weird that by the time we get to the end we're really truly relived to see his transformation - and my jaw nearly dropped when I saw it achieved. Skits tied together don't always turn out well, but this little film sort of has what it takes to stretch out to full length. My own high school experience was more like Napoleon Dynamite than other films like American Pie (good grief). The internet romance between Kip and Lafawnduh is a bit unlikely, as is the weirdness of \\"Uncle Rico\\" being Napoleon's guardian (Jon Heder was 27 when Napoleon Dynamite was filmed) is a stretch, but it's all in good fun. Vote Pedro!
B001BNCYV8|5.0|I first bought the Top on cassette in the mid-90s for one reason: I had the Standing on a Beach compilation, and really liked The Caterpillar, and I wanted to find out what else was on this album. I'll admit I was very disappointed at first. I thought it must be the worst Cure album ever. Obviously I wasn't ready for this album, or was expecting something else. I only became aware of the Cure in 1993, so I discovered their albums in a haphazard non-chronological manner, starting with Standing on a Beach, Disintegration, Wish, and kind of working backwards. By 1998 I was a hard-core fan trying to track down all their b-sides (which I did eventually, about 3 years before Join the Dots came out). The Top was one of the last albums I \\"discovered,\\" even though I had the cassette for years before many of the other early albums. I think my point here is that The Top is a fantastic, massively enjoyable album, but is far less accessible or universal as much of their other work. It is an acquired taste, perhaps only for Cure fans or people who are generally into avante-garde music. Still it's puzzling that it wasn't available for so long on compact disc in the US, as if somehow it wasn't worthy of release. So this most recent edition is much appreciated. Finally a note about bananafishbones. This wasn't a frequently performed song at live shows, but I do have one recording of it from Hertongenbosch, May 30, 1984. It is interesting that the tempo on this day was even faster, at 82 bpm than the new tempo of the remastered edition (76 bpm). When I first acquired this recording I thought the cassette must have been played back too fast when it was transferred to mp3. But there's nothing else in the recording that indicates this. Which makes me think that Robert Smith must have very early on regretted the slow tempo on the LP, and that he was wanting this chance at remastering for over 20 years. Not to say the Cure wouldn't play a song faster live, but this is by far the most dramatic example I've heard.
078322737X|5.0|I saw this ages ago, and we all grew up with ghosts of Happy Days flitting past us making us nostalgic to a California era (and its music) that occurred ten years before we were born, so it was interesting to see it again now that I too am going through a phase of listening to \\"golden oldie\\" bands, although in my case it's the feedback-drenched psychadelia of Blue Cheer and the Yardbirds. American Grafitti is a great film, full of funny characters and good dialogue, fantastic editing, and great tunes - so good, in fact, that it's hard to believe that it came from the mind that produced the screenplay for The Phantom Menace. There's a young pre-fame Harrison Ford driving around prepping for his next role as Han Solo, and also Richard Dreyfuss as a college-bound kid wondering whether he should stick around town or look around a bit. Lots of nuances, which is a word you don't often use when describing George Lucas, such as the scene when Richard Dreyfuss has a talk with his teacher, and a girl comes up at the end of the conversation and says \\"teach, can I talk with you for a minute?\\" The scene is pregnant with meaning, but Lucas is subtle (?!?) about it and drops the story and moves on. There's also good fun when Dreyfuss (he seems to get all the best scenes) gets initiated into the local gang, the Pharaohs. It's such a very white white white town, that even the gangsters are white. To inject a bit of colour, though, Wolfman Jack has a great cameo. Suzanne Sommers as \\"the blonde in the T-bird\\" is basically unrecognizable, but hey - it's Chrissy!

B00005JMJG|4.0|A strange movie about memory. Jim Carry is an unlovable schmuck, but for some reason he meets this wacky, gorgeous girl who's also quite horny. Slowly we get to see him interact with this girl, slowly we realize that there's much more behind their relationship. Why? Because it's a film from a Charlie Kaufmann script, where anything can happen. The couple has tender, happy moments that are very memorable (or memory-like) in an iconic kind of way. These are devices we refer back to, they make the movie feel like it is warm, comfortable, and we root for the heroes who struggle against what they are doing to themselves. Do they know that they were destined to be together? Things get weird - once we figure out what is going on, we get some back story. And then that back story gets back story. And then that back story also gets back story. And then the back story becomes the only story that there ever was. Because it's destiny. Complaints? None, really, although Kirstin Dunst acting horny is a bit awkward - she doesn't do horny well. Elijah Wood is good and creepy. And Jim Carrey - well, he can act... like a dork. I sometimes wonder how many people out there have so much time for resolving their inner demons that they don't really need to do regular things like work, cook, watch TV...
B000001EUR|5.0|I still have the original vinyl, and enjoy listening to that most, via an Ion Turntable, and ripping to MP3.  \\"Love At First Sting\\" was very much a big part of the 80's soundtrack, right up there with the best of 80's heavy metal, hard rock and pop music.    How often do you see a German hard rock band produce a top 10 album in the states?  This is it.     You gotta give it up to Klaus and the Scorps, this album and \\"Blackout\\" are 80's heavy metal/hard rock masterpieces.    Love At First Sting has at least six singles that all received, and still receive, national radio airplay.  I am not suggesting that is what defines great music, but certainly shows that it's an album that shouldn't be underrated or scoffed at, in terms of rock history.
B0013D8LOK|1.0|I thought that this was just about the most repulsive movie I've ever seen - and not just because it was a musical! The blood and guts were a bit much, and all of the throat slitting and waterfalls of blood was putridly excessive, not to mention the awful, soulless \\"songs\\" that they sang! I thought it would be good fun watching Sacha Baron Cohen in a movie where he wasn't Borat or Ali G, but the \\"duel\\" that he \\"fought\\" with Sweeney Todd just didn't make any sense. Helena Bonham Carter, who is very attractive, is difficult to look at when she's made up in Marilyn Manson corpse make-up. I thought that Tim Burton would try to infuse at least some sort of dark humour into this story of a sort-of-sympathetic serial killer, but I'm not sure he even tried this time around since the film is really as gothic as it wants to be. Not recommended.
B00005K9LM|5.0|This album was the last of the great Judas Priest era of British heavy metal music, and deserves to be put into the same class as their best 70's and early 80's albums, from Rocka Rolla to Screaming For Vengeance.      When you try to deny it, it throws great songs at you like \\"The Sentinel, \\"Love Bites,\\" \\"Freewheel Burning,\\" \\"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll,\\" \\"Night Comes Down,\\" - every song on this album is very good. This is even an accomplishment for Priest.     While I still enjoyed Halford's incredible range and their songs into the late 80's, \\"Defenders\\" was their last dark, genuine and complete album.  That they still are releasing music and touring, is strange to me, in that I consider this album their Swan Song, in 1984.     It was great to pull this vinyl record out of my old collection and find it in such good condition.  There is absolutely nothing like listening to the original, master vinyl recordings on today's technology.  CD's do not sound nearly this good.     Rock on.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|I read online how good this was. When I found it in my local mom 'n' pop CD shop here in Singapore, my curiosity got the better of me and I bought it. Five hours of early Maiden, great great great. I watched snatches of it late into Monday night and it was fascinating.<br /><br />Iron Maiden's two main guitarists, Dave Murray and Adrian Smith, are magicians and really awesome to watch. When I was a kid, I loved listening to this stuff; as an adult, I have to admit that I still love listening to this stuff, but now I love watching it just as much! I'd never seen the band play. Dave Murray always plays a black Fender Stratocaster just like the one I have, and Adrian Smith sometimes also plays a Les Paul like I have (although he's probably playing a top notch version, while mine is an el-cheapo Epiphone Les Paul Studio). Paul DiAnno is an awesome frontman, and I love his voice, although the studded wristlets are a bit much.<br /><br />In the video you also see how the young Bruce Dickenson, while a very intelligent person with a great voice, is a bit of a cheezy showman, and his outfits are also quite corny - especially the red tights (Steve Murray also seems to favour tights). Well, they make great music, forgive them their fashion faux pas.<br /><br />The documentary on the second disc is really good fun, although it basically looks like Steve Murray's only strategy was to get a dozen ex-Iron Maiden members down to the pub one afternoon, buy them beer, and let them wander down memory lane for the cameras one after the other while the others hung about playing darts and eating crisps. That's interspliced with pics and live clips to put it in context, but it only backs up the impression that it's impossible to think of Iron Maiden without thinking about - love him or hate him - Steve Harris. Sure, why not, he started the band, and has been the only one who has been with it throughout, and he seems to write most of the songs as well.
031606792X|1.0|Let me state straight way, I am not an teenage girl, but even they must roll their eyes that this inane book, the worst in the series, and that is really saying something.  Look, I sorta liked Twilight, and New Moon was not bad, Eclipse was HORRIBLE and this book just continued the decent.  This book is bad from the start and goes downhill from there..it begins with Bella driving a tricked out Mercedes, given to her by Edward, she's horrible at driving it of course, because our Bella is stupid, clutz, as she pulls up the the fuel it up, she of course pulls out Edwards credit card, I suppose he pays for everything now...Jesus, this is the 2000's not 1800, doesnt Bella have any pride..anyway, we then learn that this is sort of a trial car, her real car, is some even more fabulous auto, she will get later..and of course Edward derives his moneybag status, as do all of the Cullens, but cheating the stock market..really cool, now that people are jumping off buildings because that guy swindled those people out of 50 billion..but Edward is smokin hot..so who cares right?..we then learn that he has somehow gotten the obtuse Bella into Ivy League Dartmouth, she has neither the grades nor the money, but who cares right?..Edward will pay with his stolen money and she can attend Dartmouth eventhough he cheated to get her in there...then comes the wedding..UGGG..if i have to hear SM's clucky dialogue viltered through Bellas vacuous head, im going to lose it!!..Honestly, her ridiculous description of Edward when she sees him in his tux for the first time is so pathetic, you're embarassed for her.  I swear half of the pages in this four book series are devoted to Bella obsession with Edwards looks..we get it..she finds him a smokin hot..a god like magnificence..ENOUGH!!..it's just the limit..then Jacob arrives..the poor guy tries on last time to make the vacuous, colosselly clueless, vapid, selfish Bella to see reason..but hey she's about to get Edward to make her a hot corpse andshe'll come into all this money and will be with the off the charts hot Edward, so what does she care if Jacob is in love with her, or is trying to save her soul..she like..AS IF!!...oh and whats up with Billy, Charlies supposed best friend, not telling him that his daughter is..uh ..marrying a vampire!!..he's sworn to protect against vampires and here he is at Bellas wedding to..a..VAMPIRE..i mean, how stupid are these people?..and as Bella leaves after marrying Edward, she hears Jacob howl..and she just sort of says nothing..i mean get real, surely he sees he's not as fabulous as Edward..i mean right?..and that's what it is all about with bella..i mean right?..whatever..at that point i threw the book in the trash.and havent looked at it sense and wont..i through with the inane, poorly written mess that is the Twilight series..im just glad that i borrowed all of these books and didnt in anyway support this ridiculous rage for these books..I stand amazed at the obsession for the cold as ice, boring Edward, he has nothing really to say, he's HOT sure, but he's actually a 100 yr old withered fossil, he's cold as ice, hard as stone, and uh..drinks blood..e[...] desirable..and his whole life is saving or making selfish, shallow, vapid, Bella happy, even she can see, she in no way deserves this largesse(the one time in this whole series I actually agree with her)..he's a 100 year old man obsessed with an 18yr old..i mean how creepy is that...oh and he's a corpse as well..but hey he's HOT, right?..as for Bella, she is without question the most vaccous, selfish, shallow, heroine in recent memory..she makes Daisy Buchanan look like Mother Teresa...i can say to Bella is..peace out~
B000UD08HW|5.0|Wow, over five hours of David Gilmour. I have to say first off that watching this always makes me think of Pink Floyd in Pompeii. At that time David Gilmour bore a striking resemblance to Leonardo Dicaprio, whereas in this he bears a striking resemblance to Malcolm McDowell or Terrence Stamp, but with less hair. He's onstage at the Royal Albert Hall, very much the leader of his band of 10 musicians, many of whom are there to recreate the multiple guitar parts of his Pink Floyd and solo songs. Included from his solo albums are only songs from the recent \\"On An Island\\" (nothing from \\"About Face\\" or \\"David Gilmour\\", for some reason) and he brings David Crosby and Graham Nash to sing harmonies with him. Crosby, Gilmour and Nash sound great, although Crosby and Nash look funny - the former short and paunchy with his hands in his pockets all the time and the latter both boogying and grimacing strainingly as he sings. For a hippy bluesman, it's a bit odd that Gilmour has such a posh accent, but those guitar solos are great, even if he is also a bit paunchy and makes frog faces as he makes his guitar grown and wail. He mostly plays his all-black Stratocaster, although he does pull out a gold Les Paul for a song, and also a flesh-coloured Telecaster, as well as various Turkish string instruments, slide guitars, and at one point a saxophone. Disc 1 is a full concert recording of one of the band's nights at the Royal Albert Hall. Gilmour starts the album with three songs from Dark Side of the Moon - \\"Speak to Me,\\" \\"Beathe\\", they skip \\"On the Run,\\" then play \\"Time.\\" It's odd, to me, to not hear the full album (I never listen to single songs from that album if I don't have to) but those three songs sound good, especially the saxophone solo done by Dick Parry, the original performer from Dark Side of the Moon recording - he switches from a baritone sax to a tenor sax without skipping a beat, great stuff. Gilmour and the band then plays the full new album, and it's tight and meaty, with two songs featuring Crosby and Nash, and one with Robert Wyatt of Soft Machine playing the trumpet from his wheelchair. After a break, they come out and play \\"Shine On Your Crazy Diamond\\", which for a while is just David Gilmour and Richard Wright behind his impressive bank of keyboards. There is a very nice version of \\"Fat Old Sun\\" from the \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" album, and also an impressive \\"Echoes\\"... which does hearken the listener back to Live At Pompeii... These people have come a long way in 35 years. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" feels very personal before it picks up in a band thing. David sings \\"Find The Cost of Freedom\\" with Crosby and Nash, one of their songs, before bringing out David Bowie to sing \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" It might be hard to imagine Bowie singing Pink Floyd songs, but he does a great great job and makes it sound natural (interesting how I also bought a Bowie CD on the same day, \\"Live Santa Monica \\"72'). The solo from \\"Comfortable Numb\\" is stunning, especially the lead-out version, which just screams and screams and screams. Dear Lord!!! The crowd were dancing in the aisles, it was terribly moving.<br /><br />But ultimately, while the cameramen do get some nice shots of David soloing and do zoom in on his fingers (one of the main reasons I bought this) the concert suffers a bit from a lack of attention to this point and also some choppy jumping around from player to player, and also an odd \\"over-the-precipice\\" camera boom shot that they throw in from time to time that looks like it is the same shot over and over again (you couldnt' tell if it was taken at a different time in the concert, since it was so far from the stage). But this is not a major problem in the video, since there is plenty of everything to please the viewer and the Pink Floyd fan, especially the nuggets and the great guest features.<br /><br />Disc 2 has nice songs on it, as well as some documentaries. For the songs, they do \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"Comfortable Numb\\" with Richard Wright instead of David Bowie from the other nights at the Royal Albert Hall and it's not quite the same - Wright does seem a bit stodgy and square, he clearly has none of Bowie's mojo. Theres also a nice version of \\"Wot's... Uh, the Deal\\" from \\"Obscured by Clouds\\", one of the nuggets they dug out and a very nice one indeed. Also some Syd Barrett songs \\"Dominoes\\" and \\"Dark Globe.\\" A cool live-in-the-studio verson of \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" an impromptu rendition of a part of \\"Echoes.\\" There are five songs performed in the BBC Mermaid Theatre that were part of the first public performance of the album. The video for \\"On An Island\\" is very nice, especially the solo which shows David playing in his room of guitars. Smile has background vocals from Polly Sampson, Gilmour's wife, a sweet ballad.<br /><br />There are also some good documentaries, such as 45-minute \\"Breaking Bread, Drinking Wine\\" about the \\"On An Island\\" tour. They band rehearse in the UK at the same production area that Roger Waters is also renting a part of, so there's a scene of the two having a brief chat and hugging (lots of hugging in this one) and also Nick Mason appearing with David's drummer Steve DiStanislao. Hanging out with Crosby and Nash and Bowie (3D, as in three Davids - Bowie, Crosby and Gilmour), David practising saxophone, and then going on tour. They play a castle in Linz, and David does \\"Dark Globe,\\" his first performance since Syd Barrett died and the first time he'd ever practiced or performed \\"Dark Globe.\\" They play at an old Roman amphitheatre in Vienne in France, and of course they reference Pompeii by showing the band doing \\"Echoes.' They play in the Florence piazza, then also in San Marcos square in Venice where they run into all sorts of logistics problems. There are fun incidents about playing water glasses onstage, and when they run into a street performer who does this in Venice they drag him onstage with them. At the end they meet Lech Walesa and play the shipyards of Gdansk on the 26th anniversary of the Solidarity movement, which is moving. Before the documentary starts a message says \\"when you see this special mark press enter to see extended content\\" which means you don't have to hunt around for secret easter eggs to access stuff like this.<br /><br />A 17-minute documentary on the making of \\"On An Island\\" is not as good, although you do get a sort of tour of the Astoria, which is Gilmour's houseboat recording studio on the Thames. There are some stories about the inspirations for some of the songs, and tales of how the lyrics got added and why. There's also five minutes of backstage images from the west coast of the US, which are only interesting because Jude Law shows up, and maybe Crispin Hellion Glover (but I'm not so sure if it's him or someone else).Wright instead of David Bowie from the other nights at the Royal Albert Hall and it's not quite the same - Wright does seem a bit stodgy and square, he clearly has none of Bowie's mojo.

B001C08RHA|5.0|I could already tell this movie would be a lot of fun from the trailer, but I was surprised just how good it really was.  This could easily be one of my favourite Marvel Comics movies, better even than Spiderman or X-Men (forget Daredevil or Electra or Punisher or Ghost Rider).  Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect casting choice, a la Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  Marvel movies are usually well casted anyway, with the exception of Toby Maguire as Spiderman (he's popular, but I'm of the opinion that James Franco would have been better as the image of Peter Parker from the comics) and Ben Affleck as Daredevil.  Jon Favreau, the brilliant writer of Swingers, clearly has as much fun with the character as Sam Raimi has with Spiderman, and Tony Stark is very well fleshed-out and real.  Comparisons would abound with Batman - both were born rich, have reputations as playboys, lost their parents, head giant corporations, have no super powers of their own but are good at stocking up on useful gadgets -  but this film is better than any of the Batman flicks for my money (keeping in mind I haven't seen the latest one).  Great background story of how Stark became Iron Man, and also a fantastic technology sequence where Stark is perfecting his machine.  The battle at the end is not bad, although not as cool as the fight scenes in Matrix 2, and the movie has the best ending/closing line of any movie in recent memory.  I also loved the use of the song \\"Iron Man\\" by Black Sabbath in the closing credits of the film, spot on.
0486448843|2.0|I thought this was greeting cards and it was little tear-off cards.  Very disappointed.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I wondered why Pixar picked this as a title for their new movie, considering that it's a French dish and you need to educate people how to pronounce it on the movie poster itself; but by the time you've seen the movie to the end it becomes apparent why it could not be called anything else. Pixar seems to have been making kids movies that adults can enjoy, but this seems to me to be the first time they've made an adult movie that kids can enjoy.<br /><br />I was a bit sceptical about this film at first, since the trailers didn't make it look very interesting - sort of ho-hum like Flushed Away or something - but the reviews were all so glowing (the Rotten Tomatoes critics poll gave it a 96 percent approval) that I had to see it. And it really lived up to those reviews. The film is about a rat that wants to cook, and while the UB40 song \\"Rat in the Kitchen\\" is never used, the idea of rats being icky creatures to be banished from the kitchen is a sqeamish thought that's... never really addressed here.  It kind of makes me think of an essay I read in Esquire in the mid-80s about the 50 most influential people of the 20th century (so far).  One of them was Walt Disney, and the hypothesis of the essay is that Disney could take a story like Franz Kafka's the Metamorphosis and turn it into a song and dance with a cute cockroach and melt everyone's hearts (which they tried to do with \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\"). Well, Disney put clothes on a rat and called him Mickey, but Pixar pushed the envelope a bit by putting a real, raw rat in the kitchen and asked us to be happy that he's handling the foodstuffs without a proper de-lousing.  And we fell for it.  Does this mean that Pixar is clever, or does this mean that we're idiots?  Well, Disney was never as bold, and now Pixar has taken the step that that Esquire article warned us about.  Hilarious.<br /><br />As good as Pixar is, it has gotten a bit derivative recently - the Incredibles, as good as the film was, ripped off both the Watchmen (plot) and the Fantastic Four (powers, villain).  Cars was a rehash of \\"Doc Hollywood,\\" but with automobiles.  But Ratatouille is something different.  There are bizarre non-sequitars: where are the female rats in all this, why not show more of Remy's childhood to understand how he became so interested in cooking rather than introduce him as if he were a character in \\"Trainspotting\\"; and Linguini's abrupt romance is a bit difficult to understand.<br /><br />But never mind, the story of the little restaurant that could... then couldn't... then could again is quite a lot of fun.  Sure there's that icky part where the friends' conflicting emotions cause them to momentarily betray each other (every movie needs its movie cliche), but the way the ending is wrapped up is quite impressive.  I don't remember the last time an animated movie about rats that cook brought a tear to my eye either.(plot) and the Fantastic Four (powers, villain).

B0018SWA56|4.0|Happy I picked up this book before something borrowed... this book was great and something borrowed was well written I just didn't enjoy that book because of the betrayal of a best friend. This book is inspiring and heartwarming. A great read.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I loved \\"Dummy,\\" that first Portishead. It really takes me to a special place. When I heard that the band was releasing a new album after 10 years of silence, I was immediately intrigued. Yay, Portishead, had to pick this up the day it was released - anything to hear a bit more of Beth Gibbons' voice... The first listen to the album at work I wasn't so impressed, but that could be because of the environment (no comment). The first song starts off with some sample of a Spanish radio DJ saying something I can't understand. The song, \\"Silence,\\" starts off with fast-paced drums and guitara chords and some keyboard. Lovely feedback, very soundtrack-y. Two minutes into the song Beth's voice comes in. Lovely. For some reason the song ends very abruptly. \\"Hunter\\" is very mellow, has nice feedback guitars in it. Songs become soundtrack, then there's \\"The Rip\\", which sounds like the Rolling Stones' \\"Wild Horses\\" as re-interpreted by Daft Punk, or perhaps Tangerine Dream. Nice stuff. Lots of snazzy drumming. \\"We Carry On\\" has Moog organs, trumpets, and Sonic Youth guitar wrangling, it is one of the more \\"challenging\\" tracks on the album. Yes, the beats are definitely a lot harder, sort of industrial compared to the old shuffle beat of \\"Dummy.\\" Challenging, indeed.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|No, this is not Jane Austen or Merchant Ivory, this is Al Gore. The big, sweaty man has come back and traveling the world with his message, he's also staring intently at the screen of his Mac Powerbook. He does one thing very well in this movie: he shows that industry is producing a great deal of CO2, and then he correlates a rise in CO2 with a rise in average global temperatures; this is part of the here and now, the world today. He also paints interesting scenarios of what this might mean for the world, any of which is very scary indeed. But as he disingenously points out, thousands of peer-reviewed scientific reports have been written to prove that global warming is a real phenomenon, while none have been written to debunk it. In other words, there was no reason to make this film, other than to give a voice to the scientific community by a well-known non-politician (since there are no longer any well-known scientists except cranks with agendas like Richard Dawkins). More interesting to me is the structure of the film and the way it influences (or manipulates) the viewer. One scene where he is hinting that the last devastating global crisis that the world faced was the one that Winston Churchill warned about in 1932 is followed after a long pause by one where he talks about losing the White House to George Bush. He is juxtaposing mentions of Nazis with comments on the current Washington administration. Sneaky, or just plain brilliant? He also makes his story even more personal by finding ways to make relevant to the narrative two family crises: the car accident that nearly claimed the life of his son and the cancer that robbed him of his beloved sister. While I'm not sure what they have to do with global warming, it does make the story tender. And when Al shifts from being a sad sack \\"the next president of the United States\\" to being an inspirational firebrand, you know that the film is over.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|The bluray directors cut comes with a second disc with a digital copy on it, as is becoming popular with many releases.

0156034565|4.0|This is a very unusual book about a fisheries expert who is approached by mysterious people who seem to have a lot of money to engage on a foolish mission to introduce salmon to Yemon. Tigers in Antarctica, squid in the Himalayas, flamingos in Iceland, pandas on the moon. Maybe, why not? The story is told in a series of letters, emails, testimonials and transcripts, so you get a good sense of the unreliable narrator as various points of view of the same incident, but in a more natural way than perhaps Rashomon or the like, since there was no crime, just a project unfolding and coming to its natural conclusion. Some of the characters are a bit caricature-ish, particularly the main henpecked narrator and his shrew of a wife (who has concluded that you need an income of over 70,000 pounds a year to support children, etc.). The mysticism of Sheikh Muhammed is a bit hard to take for someone who has never met a whiskey-sipping mystical sheikh, but the loving descriptions of the geography of Yemen, the sport of fly fishing and the life cycle of the salmon, as well as some brilliant character sketches make this a book well worth reading.
B0012Q732O|1.0|Definitely one of the worst movies of 2008. Crtitics described this as a dumbed down Apocalypta. That is an exageration. It is way worse than  a dumbed down Apocalypta. It is absolutely terrible. It lacks a story. What it does have is a crew of very good special effects artists. Other than that this is non-stop violence. This type of movie would mostly be appealing to a red-neck crowd, because all they care about is violence, and could care less if there was a story.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Cool cover showing a coffin garlanded with a magnetic halo of iron filings, the booklet pages are cut through to give it some depth (literally).  Opening track \\"This Was Just Your Life\\" sounds a bit like \\"Blackened,\\" the opening track of the 1988 album that \\"Death Magnetic\\" is called a revival of.  Somehow \\"The End of the Line\\" comes out a bit bluesy, although it quickly begins to headbang.  \\"Beaten, Broke and Scarred\\" is a pretty good track, while the infectious \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" sounds like something from the Black Album.  They have a pretty good video for it out already that should appeal to all the young Metallica fans serving in Iraq. \\"All Nightmare Long\\" is one of those fast fast things with lots of wah in the solo.  \\"Cyanide\\" is a dull song with a good solo that has a brief, strange Iron Maiden moment. \\"Unforgiven III\\" is another catchy song, not a sequel to the Clint Eastwood/Morgan Freeman film. The squeaky guitar solo is not too bad. \\"The Judas Kiss\\" is loud and angry with a very fast solo, lots of wah and a bit of flange. No bass, of course, it's trapped at the bottom of the mix, I don't know why Metallica needs a virtuoso bassist like Robert Trujillo, although a bit of burbling does come out in the instrumental \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" (an ironic poke at Trujillo's old band, Suicidal Tendencies?). Following the album's longest song is its shortest, \\"My Apocalypse,\\" which closed \\"Death Magnetic\\" with five minutes of fury. Good, fast, punky.
B001CTDH4Y|4.0|I know how much cinephiles loathe this motion picture and others of its genre, but, dudes and gals, loosen up! Sure, \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua: [1]\\" is more than a little \\"sappy\\", but take some time out to be \\"sappy and happy\\" viewing this movie (available as viewed on DVD, among other DVD and Blu-Ray editions, as Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment 057850/02)! The adventures of these chihuahuas, other dogs, and assorted animals is a delight, especially for those who have a \\"tender spot\\" for the hounds! This movie never was meant to appeal to the viewer's sophistication. On the other hand, it is not any sort of \\"chihuahua exploitation film\\", either.<br /><br />My favourite hounds in this California-Mexico romp are Pap&iacute;, Chlo&eacute;'s ardent male admirer and very determinedly valiant chihuahua, and Delgado, the down-on-his-luck, butch German shepherd who rescues, and does various acts of kindness for, Chloë, even when he misinterprets the reasons for Chloë's second disappearance. Then, too, who cannot love the thronging hoard of chihauhuas among the ruins of an ancient indigenous culture? Seeing Chloë try to find the mighty voice of her \\"inner chihuahua\\" (as opposed to pampered pet squeaks and whimpering) with the aid of the leader of this pack of chihuahuas is very amusing; I wish that this bit of animal humour had been more extended!<br /><br />This is a pack of fun, and not just for children! Have a barking good time watching this film, in the theatre or at home on the DVD or Blu-Ray player!<br /><br />----------<br />Postscript, July 2014: Since writing the above, I have seen parts two and three, the sequels of the Chihuahua trilogy, i.e. \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua: 2, the Family Just Got Bigger\\" (Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment 105886) and \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua: 3, Viva la Fiesta, Family Always Matters\\" (Disney 109086/02). Each leading canine cast favourite hound will bound around on your screen for more Chihuahua mania! My favourite of the twosequels is the \\"Beverly Hill Chihuahua: 3\\", which is wonderfully zany and replete with one madcap antic after another. In that one, Papi and Chloë (and the others) celebrate daughter Rosita's \\"quincea&ntilde;era\\" (its timing reckoned in equivalent \\"dog years\\"), while some skullduggery has been taking place at a fancy Beverly Hills pet hotel, where a treacherous female employee and a suspicious administrative hound, on behalf of the leading rival such establishment, the two of them colluding with an outside secret agent, are undertaking some disloyal commercial spying and sabotage, which Delgado, Papi, and others uncover and thwart, saving their human master's and mistress' jobs there while they are at it. The canine Mariachi band for Rosita's party and during the rehearsals for it is especially droll and endearing.<br /><br />Don't miss these movies! You and the children or teenagers of your household also might enjoy the attractively written, printed, and illustrated \\"junior novels\\" published so far (as of mid-2014) which are based on the first two films of the trilogy!
B00005MP58|5.0|With over 1500 other reviews on Amazon for this DVD set, why write another one?      Because it's a great series, that's why!    OK -- confession time: I'd never been a fan of \\"chick\\" authors such as Jane Austen, but boy, was I mistaken!  Friends at work turned me on to this series when it first appeared on A&E, and I was immediately sucked into the story.  And what a great story it is!    The adaptation remains very faithful to the novel (a fact which I discovered when I read the book after I'd seen the series), so much so that a pivotal scene that occurs *exactly* half way through the book also occurs *exactly* half-way through the series.    Colin Firth plays a Darcy that I don't believe shall ever be equaled (a role that he seems to have reprised, time and again, in later films), and the entire cast, from top to bottom, is great.  That, coupled with set and costume design that seems to authentically replicate the period, gives the series a lushness and depth that is a pleasure to watch.    The series stands up well to multiple viewings (always a sign of a great film).  In fact, it's one of my favorite things to watch during the Christmas Holidays when it's cold and wet outside.    Anyway -- it's well worth five stars, and if anyone has not yet seen it (hard as that is to believe), my advice is: get thee to the video store!

B001EOQWEO|1.0|I will add my voice to the many having received discs that are defective. We tried to watch this on Christmas Day (I bought it for my daughter for Christmas) and the disc paused, stuttered, and frequently displayed large areas of pixellation. What a disappointment. I wish I had carefully read other reviews here, as this problem appears to be startlingly common.
B000RF7XYO|1.0|It has been about 4 days since I have seen the movie and can't remember that much about this one.  I guess that tells how much I liked the movie.  It was ok and the special effects were ok as well.  I would however recommend Elizabeth: The Golden Age over this one anytime.  I still would recommend buying the cheapest version of either movie since I don't think you will remember either one for a long time.  I did give the Golden Age higher marks as it did have a better storyline.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|This is a modern classic fairytale about a curse that strikes a family and how it affects the first born daughter by giving her a pig shaped nose/snout. Penelope is the first born female in a long line of males in her family. Penelope has lived with the curse for almost 20 years and lived a sheltered existence behind the walls of her family mansion. Her family did this to keep her away from the press and from the whole world finding out about her. Her parents lied to the media that Penelope died in her infancy.<br /><br />Anyway now 20 years later in order for Penelope to 'break the curse' and have a normal face she must MARRY another human. Unfortunately all the people who their parents try to find run away and some even crazily jump through the window when they see Penelope snouted face (which makes me feel very bad for her)! Everyone runs away except James McAvoy's character who is paid $5,000 by the media to get a picture of her and release it to the public. A romance starts building up between Penelope and McAvoy's character that the audience is cheering throughout for them to get married.<br /><br />You will just have to watch the movie yourself to see if the curse is actually broken and if they end up together (I don't want to ruin the plot). Also on a final note you will love the part where Penelope runs away from home when things get real hard for her and she meets Resse Witherspoon's character at a bar. But the central message of the movie is that if you love yourself for who you are then anything is possible.
B0019KWE6S|5.0|This album is gorgeous, one of the best in this decade, period! Music is beautiful, excellence on every level! You don't have to live in Sweden or have a emotional turmoil to appreciate it (though it might help :-) The albums of this level are rare nowadays. The depth of emotions and beauty of arrangements and lyrics - all inclusive, all organically laid out there for you to immerse in. Unbelievable! Anyone who likes David Sylvian will adore this album. The only complain I have - it has no printed lyrics in the booklet. Beautiful, rich packaging (as always from the Sylvian's camp), every detail is though trough, that's why I will complain about that. This music REQUIRES lyrics in the packaging, as they are just as important and just as deep and beatiful, and can stand out on itself as the poetry as everything else on this record. Just like on David Sylvian's records. Other then that little gripe - buy it now!
0316017922|5.0|Although I believe most of us have a bit of knowledge about why certain ethnic groups seem to do well from the perspective of success in the United State's way of measuring success, Gladwell really drives the point home and shows us the many inequities in certain sub-cultures as well as the huge advantage certain random things can give someone such as the year one was born, the month one was born, and particulary, by the certain culture and lineage one is born into and influenced by.<br /><br />But the overall message to me is that hard work, focus and industriousness can lead virtually anyone almost anywhere.  And that as a society, we need to focus on giving everyone a chance to succeed and to be better at developing a greater work ethic if we are going to be able to compete with our harder working and more dedicated competition overseas.<br /><br />There's a certain amount of finger pointing to the wrong thinking of the white shoed country club set here in America, and how they sat idly by as others moved up and beyond them because of their biased and somewhat lazy ways.  There's also some great explanations as to why some geniuses succeed and others never move beyond the average life of an average american.  I felt that the book made some great points, especially regarding the cultural biases that we inherit from predecessors way back in our histories.<br /><br />Read the book, it is fun, well written and sometimes a real eye opener.
B000EHSVQ4|3.0|The Bottom Line:    As for as the theatrical version is concerned, Kingdom of Heaven is a big glorious mess of a movie--it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it has its share of enjoyable scenes.
1401200923|5.0|Hush vol 2 is to the comic book medium as Saving Private Ryan is to film. In the same way Spielberg was able to bring the characters to the forefront in a film awash in cinematic action. In the same way Hush is neither an action movie nor your standard techno-drama/ mystery, it is both at the same time, and not only that it does it incredibly well. Fans either of Jeph Loeb's writing or Jim Lee's illustrations will be happy to add this to their collection. The story line is riveting both for it's twisting plot but also for its rich characters. The Dark Knight's character is more human and real than your standard take on Batman because of Loeb's skilled narration. At the same time Jim Lee makes the characters jump off the page in a way I've only seen matched by Alex Ross's \\"Kingdom Come\\". The result, exactly what most fans are looking for, a new take on the tired character of Batman presented in a way that will blow you away, pick this one up.<br /><br />Preceded by<br />[[ASIN:1401200605 Batman: Hush, Vol. 1]]
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Yeah yeah, there is a lot of talking and there is also a lot of talking. This is a Tarantino movie, and his characters love to talk. But if you didn't spend the time hanging out with the girls of Death Proof, then you wouldn't give two s***s about them when it all hits the fan.     As Stuntman Mike, Kurt Russell owns this film - until Zoe Bell shows us what she's made of.     If you are a fan of classic movie stunt work, with the raw energy and brutal force that is Tarantino - then you will dig this flick!
1401200605|5.0|Hush volume one was and is and excellent comic. However the context of when and how the work was printed needs to be considered. Lobe is an exallent writer hands down, famous for his take on batman in the Long Halloween and Dark Victory, as a detective attempting to unmask a new villain Holladay and the Hangman. Enter Hush, the new aptly named villain. Normally in the comic book industry people talk and secrets are revealed, that was not the case for this project and the anticipation had fans flock the rack too see the next monthly created by one of batman's best writer's paired with an unparalleled artists. Unfortunately it wasn't a perfect marriage and Hush volume one is rocky at times. Often times comic books the writing doesn't match the artists skills. Volume one is one such case, Loeb modified his thinking man's Batman to match Lee's ability capture action. I can't say for certain if the work is a little off beat because of Loeb's change in style or if the time to set the stage for a mystery is more noticeable in a shorter work but it is noticeable. That said once the stage is set Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee do developed a rhythm and Vol 2 shares none of these short comings of this volume. Volume 1 is still a great read full of stunning art work by Lee, it just looses some of luster it once had on the comic book racks and is over shadowed by its sequal where Loeb realy brings the character's alive, this is still however not to be missed! Below is the product info for Hush vol. 2.    [[ASIN:1401200923 Batman: Hush, Vol. 2]]
0439882826|5.0|This is more than a pop-up book - it is papercraft star wars. Just buy the book. The force is strong with this one!    The book even has LED lightup lighsabers.    Amazing. Worth every penny!
B0011UCOGG|5.0|this is my all time favorite book. it is well written and fun to read. i have read it a total of 9 times.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I watched this movie at a friend's house early in the year; I didn't realize it was a comedy and I didn't realize how hilarious the film was.  I have watched this movie over and over and still my cheeks are soar from laughing.  I bought it for my sister as a birthday gift so now the both of us can watch it all the time.  I highly recommend anyone renting this film but have no doubt you would want to own it.
B001GQACGE|4.0|First of all, I do agree with everybody else on one thing, this should not have been a double CD.  All songs could've been on one disc.  However, this is where I start to diverge from the overwhelming majority.  I really did enjoy this effort.  I don't really see the gripe regarding her vocals.  Just listen to the subtlety in her delivery.  In Halo and Disappear, there are parts of the songs where she hit some very low difficult notes and then bring it up for effects.  Disappear is really quite a beautiful song.  Disc one was an enjoyable experience for me.  Disc two is just OK for me, otherwise, I would've given it 5 stars.  I hate to see people miss out on this based on the reviews here.  I think some people would really enjoy it.
0763637084|5.0|This story is my grandson's favorite of Charlie and Lolas.  I was very impressed with the intricate pop ups on each page----very nice!!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said.  This film rises above the pack in so many aspects.  And Heath Ledger's joker is the first villain I've ever seen on screen that I actually wanted to see more of in the sequel since Darth Vader.  His talent will be missed.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Well, it's Christmas Eve and I've started my annual Christmas movie marathon. This year, I watched an old favorite 'The Miracle On 34th Street'. The film is as fresh now as it was in it's original release. The film's message about commercialism taking control of the holiday rings truer each passing year!<br /><br />For those who aren't familiar with this wonderful holiday film, it's at the top of the list of great Christmas films. The cast, script and pacing are perfect. The 2 disc DVD release has commentary by star Maureen O'Hara, AMC Hollywood Back-story, A 45 minute made for TV remake of the film, which is very good and an excellent DVD transfer in both Black & White and Color!<br /><br />Merry Christmas Everyone!
B001NLPM3U|4.0|Aside from the regular 2-Disc special edition, this Blockbuster-Exclusive version has a Joker slipcover, and a journal. The slipcover really only functions when the journal and movie remain inside together, so unless you plan to keep your copy of Batman Begins inside as well, it will collapse if stacked with other movies.    The journal is just that, an empty journal you can write in. The sleeve in the back has a nice surprise for hardcore fans of the movie. As of December '08, you may still be able to find this available at your local Blockbusters for a little over/under 35$, so don't pay over a hundred on Amazon yet! The sleeve is pretty, but hardly functional.
B000XA5K48|3.0|This movie was as absurd as I expected it to be.  I knew the plot would be silly, and that the action would be implausible.  All of this was OK by me, and for the most part this film delivered.  I liked it.    Strangely, the film-makers opted to make a stand on the issue of GUN CONTROL.  They like gun control...A LOT.  Even though the hero mows down legions of baddies with his trusty pistols (and vegetables), he too is staunchly pro-GUN CONTROL.  I won't give the story away, but he performs an act in the film with the express purpose of ensuring that strong gun control measures will be enacted.      Film-makers:  Just make the silly movie.  No need to preach to your audience.  Subtracted one star for the political content.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Elephant is a pretty much perfect rock album. Jack really shows his musical range, how far he's willing to go how far he's willing to push that res-o-glass Airliner of his. This album is worth buying for \\"Ball And Biscuit\\" by itself, that song is seven minutes of pure blues/rock fury and it will never get old, its insane how much loud and how dynamic the guitar work is here. Jack really put his thing down this time. I love \\"Little Acorns\\" its like 80's vocals meets modern heavy metal, but comes off really smooth. I gotta say I think this is my favorite Stripes album. \\"Hypnotise\\" is a perfect dance rock song and definitely one of my top favorite songs ever. You people have to stop complaining about Megs drumming, Jacks singing etc., gotta remember The Stripes are stripped down raw rock and blues roll. The music is simple, good time having fun. They're not trying to be shiny and poppy like most other bands. This is garage rock that is evolving into really good original music. Meg is actually an excellent drummer she fits into Jacks style and really completes the sound. It would'nt be the same with another drummer, unless it's the one from the Racounteurs. Jack's voice, its not the best, but thats the best part cuz neither was Kurt Cobains and his voice was the best for rock and roll. Jack has that kind of cool laid back, into high pitched wail, to full out scream thing. And his guitar work will defintely overcompensate for what vocal skills he lacks. AND THIS GUY PLAYS PIANO WELL TOO! Just watch \\"Under Blackpool Lights\\". You really cant rate an album because sometimes your ears just are not ready for what you're hearing. If you're a serious live for music person like me you'll understand what I mean. I hated this album when I heard it. Even ball and biscuit, (probably my favorite song ever..) I thought it was boring. Then one day I decided to download this album again and I was blown away. People dont like what they dont know usually, that's why there is racism in theworld, and that's why music today is so stagnant, it all sound the same and lame. You have to try different things and that's exactly what The Stripes are doing. This album and their others go from 0-60 in minutes, one song may be really heavy, metal sounding, the next is \\"Hotel Yorba\\". They're psychotic schizophrenic crazy musicians that are single handedly saving Rock and roll for everybody. GIVE THE STRIPES A CHANCE. ALL HATERS GO HOME AND LISTEN TO COLDPLAY OR RADIOHEAD OR THAT OTHER BORING CRAP OUT HERE. THE STRIPES PUT EXCITEMENT BACK INTO MUSIC.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|it  was  great . i  love  this  movie  thanks
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I usually hate this type of movie and I guess I am in the holiday mood.  I left the critic at the door and just went with it.  The movie entertained me and I was able to escape my reality for the two hours plus that it was on.  I laughed and I actually cried so I think this will be one movie I may buy.  It was simply romantic and at the same time realistic with some of the love stories.  Some couples ended together, some didn't and in the end it is life.
B001LF347E|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this show. The first episode hit on that the relationship between Merlin, the young magician, and Arthur, the prince of Camelot is essential and very important. As they meet, they both sort of hate each other, but destiny brings them together, like two sides of one coin for a reason. The first episode also made it clear that Magic is forbidden in this land, so it is intriguing to see how everything would turn out. If you give this show a chance, you will be surprised by twists and turns of the events. Unexpected story, like suspense, that's what come to my mind. Everything in the story is important as things will come together and make more sense.<br /><br />The things I like the best are:<br /><br />1. Great setting. The castle in this TV show is real and it's astonishing! It is one of the best castles in France. Some scenes also take place in Wales and the woods are so magical. I donno how they do it, but the whole setting, the nature, the castles are very mystical, fantastic and beautiful!<br /><br />2. New actors. I hate big name actors. When I watch someone act, I don't want to think about the actor, I want to focus on the character, and that's what you get in this TV Show. The acting is brilliant. It is never overacted, so to keep you focused on the story. Because episodes tell the story in a fast paced manner, as there is so much to tell, the actors keep things smooth, clear and real. There are no awkward situations and the production is made to make you feel like you're there. I found myself worrying when the actors worried, even though I knew things would turn out fine. So the emotions are definitely pass on to the viewers from the skilled actors.<br /><br />3. Characters and the friendship plot. The friendship is as complicating as it is deep and also very good. We learn about the relations of Merlin and Arthur that there is love, there are difficulties, mysteries, secrets, but we also learn about friendships among the rest of the many characters in this story. They are all interconnected and deepen as the story progresses. I don't want to spoil anything, so I wont tell you who is friend and who is a foe. One thing I will mention is that every character has demons as they also have angels in them. Things may turn out for or against their relationships towards each other, you just never know how. That's what kept me watching this show. No one is too perfect or too evil. Everyone has flaws here, and they all react to them differently.  So the show is very focused on the development of characters while keeping the whole thing fast paced and action packed. I am amazed at their abilities to do that. There must be real good writers at this show. Each character has a whole lot to reveal through their past, present and even the future. I was surprised over and over by what I could learn about certain characters with each episode.<br /><br />4. The magic. The magic in this story is essential, but we also know that it is forbidden in Camelot. At first I didn't like the idea as I was too afraid that we wont see much magic happen. I was wrong. There is plenty of magic in this show. It all comes from unexpected chain of events. Also, magic is not all great. There are many who want to use it for evil, so perhaps there is a reason it is forbidden in Camelot.....<br /><br />5. Special effects. Some say the dragon in this show looks bad. I agree that it could have looked more realistic, but it is not horrible at all. In fact, it looks realistic to me. I mean, it doesn't look like an animal on geographic channel, but it does look like a mystical creature we've never really seen in life. It looks like it is done on the computer, but not to the extent that it is too obvious. You can still enjoy the dragon if you are not holding a magnifying glass in your hand trying to study its scales. The rest of the creatures and magical special effects in my opinion are great. They are just about the same as in Harry Potter movies.<br /><br />6. Message on morality. Over and over I catch myself noticing good moral lessons in this show. For young people to watch this show, is not only to enjoy the story and catchy special effects, but also to learn lessons between choosing what is right in one's life. Characters are constantly tested and at crossroads. Each decision we make matters a lot for our own future and the people we love. Morals on friendships, respect, patience, good will, forgiveness. I still remember the episode called \\"to kill the king\\". It was the most amazing lesson on forgiveness I've ever seen done on TV.<br /><br />Right now the show ended with the 13th episode, the last one of the first season and I can tell you, it is at its climax. The show has climbed up high in just 13 episodes. We now have more answers. We know the characters to heart, but we are also puzzled with new information given about them, as nothing is too certain and there are hidden skeletons on the closets. So that only makes things even more exciting. We also went through the pain, struggles, losses as well as joy, great friendships and miracles with these characters.<br /><br />As far as some complaints you may face about this show... I've heard people expressing lots of hateful messages, like the show looks cheap, actors are horrible, etc, etc... I don't know if those people are blind, or if they even saw any of \\"Merlin\\", or are they just negative trolls who know nothing but spread negativity online. Some say that the show is not as true to the original legend. But If you don't like this interpretation of the legend, there are millions of other interpretations out there, and NO ONE really knows which one is the right one. I googles the legends of king Arthur and Merlin for weeks now and have found that no one really knows what happened. No one knows who was who's son, wife, friend, foe... No one knows who killed who and so forth... There are tales and songs from everywhere saying different things. Apart from that, people also complain about the acting, and the special effects. As I am a theater actor myself, I gotta say the actors are amazing. I have yet to see anyone in this show underact or overact. And the dragon effects don't bother me a bit, as I am too focused on paying attention to what's going on. BBC cannot put more money into this as they already have. As much as they put into this show, they did an amazing job. They keep the writing entertaining, deep and mysterious, and they keep the directing smooth, fast paces and beautiful. I have only one complaint, I want to see more!!!!!<br /><br />So in the end of my review, I just hope that I was able to convince some of you to watch this show, and excite you somewhat as deep as I am excited about it. I hope I helped you lose some of you concerns and questions answered. Enjoy this TV serious with a simplistic heart and it will take you on a great journey!

B0017YDPI2|1.0|Great Season (which includes the outstanding 'A Very Supernatural Christmas').    One huge complaint with the Blu-ray edition: There is no menu -- other than a pop-up, which can only be accessed after the first episode of each disc is already playing. Very annoying if you're looking to play a specific episode. Unlike the DVDs of Seasons 1 & 2 (which go straight to the main menu, offering a list of the episodes featured on each disc), the Blu-ray discs of Season 3 begin to play the first episode straight off, forcing you to have to hit pause, then bring up the pop-up menu to find the episode you're looking for.
B001F290E4|1.0|I was not satisfied because the cd was scratched.  But I dont want to go through the trouble of sending it back.
B001E1DJD4|4.0|I too loved Happenstance. To be honest, upon my first listening of Elephants, I was disappointed. I was expecting the piano-driven, great for singing along to while driving, Fiona Apple-esque feel of Yamagata's debut. I thought that this new Elephants album was slow, boring, and as another review put it, that the songs were rather \\"samey\\" sounding.   However, as I listened to it a second, third, and now fourth time, I really like it. Elephants (disc 1) feels very raw and sincere. Yamagata's new songs have more acoustic guitar, and not as much piano as on her debut. Elephants is pretty heartbreaking and sometimes haunting... well not haunting, but something like that. It is more subdued, but each song is something special. Happenstance's songs feel pretty retrospective; I would say Elephants' songs feel like they were written right in the midst of her experiences, like they're more immediate-feeling.  With Elephants, Rachael has progressed from the attitude-driven piano-rock pop of her debut and seems to have found her sound more, and it's not what you'd expect. But then again, it's usually better when musicians take their music in a direction that surprises you.    \\"Elephants\\" opens the album with quiet, pretty piano and builds up, ending with the warning \\"for those of you falling in love, keep it kind, keep it good, keep it right / Throw yourself in the midst of danger, but keep one eye open at night\\".  \\"What If I Leave\\" is kind of like \\"Paper Doll\\" from Happenstance. It's my least favorite song on the album. It is a little boring, but a boring Rachael Yamagata song is not that bad.  \\"Little Life\\" I'd describe it as imagine if Murder By Death and Cat Power had collaborated on a song for MBD's album Who Will Survive...  \\"Sunday Afternoon\\" is one of my favorite tracks. It's like something from Fiona Apple's When the Pawn... (but of course is very much Rachael's own).  \\"Elephants (Instrumental)\\" is a pretty piano/orchestral version of the album opening track.  \\"Duet\\"is probably my favorite song of the record. It is in every way beautiful and heartbreaking. The acoustic guitar, the lyrics, Rachael's voice, Ray LaMontagne's voice. I love how their voices meld into each other's. It's as haunting and perfect as Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova's duets from the Once movie soundtrack.   \\"Over and Over\\" is the fastest-paced song of disc 1, including twangy guitar and some piano. It's got the sing-a-long-ablity and single potential of Happenstance's songs.  \\"Brown Eyes\\" is a mellow, whisper-y song, very Azure Ray (Maria Taylor, of Azure Ray, lends backup vocals) with light, strum-y acoustic guitar.  \\"Horizon\\" will remind Happenstance fans of \\"Even So\\". The piano is nice, and it builds a bit, but not as dramatically as a lot of Happenstance songs do. It ends the album well, even if a bit uncertainly.    As for Teeth Sinking Into Heart (disc 2), \\"Sidedish Friend\\" and \\"Faster\\" are good, catchy songs driven by electric guitar. I would say these are the gems of disc 2. These two are good enough that the rest of the disc's songs can be forgiven. \\"Accident\\" is okay; catchy, but missing something. \\"Pause the Tragic Ending\\" piqued my interest at the beginning of the song... it sounds like it could be a Bond movie theme song or like she was trying to channel Fiona Apple's \\"The First Taste\\". But after the first half of the song is through, it's just... eh... and it ends only to disappoint. The last song, \\"Don't\\" is not worthwhile. At all. The sincerity that is evident with Elephants isn't really present in these songs. They feel really forced.    All in all, Elephants is worthy of a second listen if upon the first you're not interested. I'm glad I didn't just write it off. Rachael is still very talented and now that I've listened to her new album a few times, honestly, I'm glad she didn't just make another Happenstance.
B0014KD46W|4.0|On Steve Winwood's CD [[ASIN:B00009MGUA About Time]], his version of \\"Why Can't We Live Together\\" hypnotized my ears, maybe my personal favorite track of the decade so far.  On \\"Nine Lives\\" Winwood is in fine form.  The opener \\"I'm Not Drowning\\" has distinctive percussion and Winwood's vocals moaning, \\"Count the cost, ghost waiting where the roads all cross.\\"  \\"Raging Sea\\" is an excellent track if you are patient enough to let its rolling rhythms and Winwood's voice like a siren draw you into the mix.  \\"Dirty City\\" pulses to a slow groove with Eric Clapton's guitar stinging as Winwood sings with equal parts allure and sinister sharpness.  \\"Secrets\\" is a good track with Winwood's B3 on fire & a nice touch with Paul Booth's flute.  Winwood's \\"Nine Lives\\" is firmly rooted in the sound, exploring the six & seven minute jam that reprises the progressive rock era.  As a set, the songs tend to blend a bit with similar tempos & percussion, as good as it is.  Still, this is a strong set that goes down smooth like a cold brew.  Enjoy!

Don't get me wrong, the movies are very good, Episode III is the best of the prequel trilogy, but it's not worth buying unless you don't have it.

B001E0JFDI|5.0|I got this book not as a children's book but because it appeared to be a nicely illustrated penguin book.  I am very happy with this acquisition (hardcover version).  The illustrations are beautiful with a charming story of a friendship between the boy and the penguin.  The images of the penguin are so endearing (and humorous!) that I find myself picking it up again and again, studying the little details.  I read somewhere that they made this into an animation for TV and showing it in U.K.  Hope it gets release in the U.S. soon.
B000ZFI1GK|5.0|I'm an Eagles fan from long ago. I'm enjoying this CD. It's nice to see that they have evolved and write lyrics to reflect on who they've become, not who they used to be.
B001CZVVVE|5.0|This opera gala from Baden Baden features four great singers: Anna Netrebko · Elina Garanca · Ramón Vargas · Ludovic Tézier. They sing many popular opera arias including \\"Mon coeur s'ouvre à ta voix\\" from Samson et Dalila (Camille Saint-Saëns) and Flower Duet from Lakmé (Delibes), the latter of which I think is a great bonus because it is hardly seen in any live concert DVDs or blu-rays. All the singers performed very nicely. Mr. Vargas's rendition of the Donizetti's aria from \\"L'elisir d'amore\\" was excellent and impressive. Most of all, however, Netrebko was the hightlight of the show. When she performed the Lehar's aria from \\"Giuditta\\" particularly, she revealed all her passion and energy with her singing and even dancing. It was a very fun, funny and entertaining moment! It showed what the best part of a live concert is. To me, this 6 minute performance alone makes this blu-ray worth getting and owning. If you have the blu-ray or DVD, The Berlin Concert Live from the Waldbühne featuring Domingo, Villazón and Netrebko, you will notice that there are some overlapped songs as a reviewer mentioned. It was actually fun for me to compare them each other by different singers and rendition.<br /><br />I enjoyed the concert and just hoped that more live concert blu-rays would be released.
B001LQCID4|1.0|For you, Amazon customer, I'm going to share my knowledge and experience with this product, according to Amazon's policy, and likewise make a comparison to a superior product.  I think you'll find this information exactly what you're looking for.<br /><br />The last example of German Expressionism, and the first in the style of New-Objectivity, the milestone sci-fi film \\"Metropolis\\" was not treated with much respect upon its initial release.  It was immediately edited to achieve a more commercially viable shorter length, and all that survives of the original 1927 film is an incomplete and partly damaged camera negative, and the shortened and re-edited release prints.  It's been in the public domain for years, and therein lies the problem in finding a good copy.  The public domain copies are all incomplete versions in which subplots were removed and motivations are sometimes left unclear.  A lot of times what you'll end up with is a copy of a copy, some from early video tapes, several generations removed for the original negative, and of course the further you get, the murkier the image gets.  Because anyone can download it from a place like Internet Archive and sell it, there are always several crude copies floating about.  In the past, I bought two of them, before I understood what was going on.  Fortunately neither of them cost nearly as much as this Triad edition.  Regardless of whatever process the claim \\"enhanced\\" includes, no real improvements can be made unless you can get your hands on an actual negative.  Triad does not have access to one, so what you'll get is just one more messy public domain copy.  And NO public domain copies are complete.  That's a fact.  So, from experience, I can pass along this information.<br /><br />If you're really interested in procuring a truly enhanced and remastered copy of \\"Metropolis,\\" might I suggest this Kino edition, [[ASIN:B00007L4MJ Metropolis (Restored Authorized Edition)]]. I bought this back in 2003, when it was newly released, and was very impressed by the exactness applied to the research and restoration. Yes, it is a bit more expensive, but it's worth every penny of it. The Murnau Foundation searched all over the world for all the best possible negatives, selected the best elements from each, went back to the original script and reassembled the elements accordingly, filled in the missing segments with title cards, and did an incredible frame-by-frame restoration. I learned all of this from the two very detailed documentaries, one exclusively on the painstaking restoration. Along with that you get a commentary track, production stills, on and on. It's chockfull of extras. The restoration was so successful, the film looked nearly like a modern release, and that's not just hyperbole. It's truly a remarkable accomplishment.  Believe me, if you want to add \\"Metropolis\\" to your film library, [[ASIN:B00007L4MJ Metropolis (Restored Authorized Edition)]] is the one you want.<br />________________________________________________y released, and was very impressed by the exactness applied to the research and restoration.

B00123B7N8|5.0|If you're a fan of Pantera you're most likely a fan of this album already but if not, you're guaranteed to love every minute of this album. I listen to many genres and own many albums from each and I can only say there's a handful I like from start to finish but this is one of my top three and I wouldn't think twice about it! As far as I'm concerned this is Pantera's finest album with NON STOP rock!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This movie has everything! Great story. Great acting. The superhero kicks major buttocks!! I was very surprised by this movie though. I'm not much of a fan of the superhero films, but I quite honestly enjoyed this film.    It's for the older and young fans of the superhero fan.

B001DU8T6S|4.0|As many reviews here accurately point out - this is not \\"Queen\\" in the classical sense.  This is the DNA of two band members + 1 blues rock singer and the results are interesting enough.<br /><br />When you think of Queen, you think of Freddie Mercury and even bassist John Deacon, and you realise how vital each one of them was to the Queen sound.  But this album is more like the Paul Rodgers meets Roger Taylor and Brian May album project (arrange names in any order you like).  In that sense, only a few songs relate to Queen's legacy.  In actuality, this feels more like a Paul Rodgers album which his fans will be absolutely delighted with.  By Queen's standards, it has just enough material that reminds you of the glorious past, but just barely.<br /><br />The three chord rockers of \\"The Cosmos Rocks\\" are really jams in comparison to the esoteric, anthemic, romantic, grandiose epics of Queen past - which is why no one can quite place the Queen sound here.  Freddie and Paul's singing styles are so vastly different that one does miss Mercury, the inventive, crazy performer who now has Paul Rodgers, the belter, the bluesman, the rocker in his corner.  In terms of their live concerts, these tracks are going to rock quite well in between the old standards.  But for those who miss Freddie Mercury, this will not fill the hole in the soul.<br /><br />This is by no means a great album nor a bad album.  It will likely grow on you with more listens.  Unlike the bombastic approach of the old Queen where one could count on a dramatic anthem to power up the listener, followed by ballads followed by ditties, The Cosmos Rocks will not reveal any soaring vocals or leaping Innuendo turns.  Every Queen album is a tough act to follow, so this album succeeds in that it does not try to compete with the past.  Nonetheless, we Queen fans will compare whatever's served to us.<br /><br />I felt The Cosmos Rocks really heading into Queen territory only by the last few tracks with the refreshing C-lebrity and Say It's Not True (the most Queen song on the album with Roger Taylor on vocals - the second voice of Queen).  Queen has always been an album band, and I felt settled once the boys had found their groove.  A few songs hint at the progressive edge that Queen has always had.<br /><br />So don't get this because you miss Mercury.  Get it to revisit some old friends.  You may find it well worthwhile.  3.5 stars.True (the most Queen song on the album with Roger Taylor on vocals - the second voice of Queen).

B001F0VHEM|5.0|I must say this album is my favourite album of this year, Funhouse has all sorts of emotion, which i admire, Pink draws you in to this Funhouse and takes you on a ride of her feelings, an what a hell of a ride it is!   For people that may think Funhouse is an all fun album THINK AGAIN, Funhouse is not all fun, do not expect 12 songs like So What, far from it!   But no matter what kinda song Pink does, she always seems to be able to make it catchy or relatable, or nearly most of time, both!.     The more uptempo songs are:     So What - Amazingly catchy! Has a great instrumental aswell, it sure did Deserve its No.1 spot in the charts!     Its All Your Fault - Another amazingly catchy and aggressive song, will most likely make you have your fists in the air trying to scream the vocals lol, this should be a single im sure it would be successful!     Boring (UK/Japan bonus track) - Its catchy, but im not to keen on this song, i was at first but i grew to dislike it...     Bad Influence - This song is sure to get you dancing or at least your feet moving, another amazingly catchy song!     Ave Mary A - Takes on world issues, Pink sings \\"We hate so fast an love too slow\\" and \\"Suicide bomber and a student shot\\" but the chorus sums it all up \\"Where did you go? Where did you go? How did you know to get out of a world gone mad!? Help me let go! of the chaos around me...\\"   This song is sure to get you thinking, Personally i love this song!     This Is How It Goes Down (bonus track) - Probably the worst song on the album in my opinion, i just don't like it, But it seems to be pretty popular with others.     Funhouse - Funky is one word to describe this song, as well as catchy! Its bound to get your body moving, a very good song!     The Midtempo songs are:     Please Don't Leave Me - The subject of the song is sad, but it will most definietely not depress you, with the \\"Da da da da's\\" and the cheerful beat, but the song is very relateable (as are most songs on this album) and you can hear the pain in Pink's voice.   Again another catchy song which should be a single!     Sober - Second single from the album, and what a very good choice it is! The song mainly consists of Drums, Guitar and strings, and also with Pink's strong vocals to top that the song is a strong single!     One Foot Wrong - Pink's strong vocals keep this song going, it feels like a mixture of genres, but it works well!     Mean - A country rock song, I think Pink does Country Rock very well! Personally i really like this song, and also the lyrics and Pink's vocals are shown strong here, Great song!     The downtempo songs are:     I Don't Believe You - Pink's most vunerable song to date, you can hear the pain in her voice, and is sure to make you tear up the first time you hear it (works better if you can relate). Amazing vocals!     Crystal Ball - An acoustic song, Its relaxing with a nice melody, Pink shows she is not scared of the future, probably my least favourite song (not including bonus tracks) but i do like the song.     Glitter In The Air - A simple piano love song with a touch of added guitar, Pink asks questions through most of the song \\"Have you ever looked fear in the face and said i just don't care?\\" \\"Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?, your whole life waiting on that ring to prove your not alone\\". Again more great vocals!     To sum up Funhouse is one hell of a ride! Pink just sings about life (whats not to relate to?) admitingly its mostly about relationships but hey we can all relate to them!     Funhouse is a must buy in my opinion, There are not many albums that you find were you like all songs on it, but Funhouse is one of those rare albums were you do! My least favourite songs are the bonus tracks (which really are not part of the album) but i must say stay away if you just want 12 So What songs, cos im sorry to say it but you will be disappointed.
0545128285|4.0|If you are someone who, like me, can't get enough Harry Potter, than The Tales of Beetle the Bard is right up your alley. It is a quick read, but an enjoyable one. Every \\"tale\\" has aspects of the wizarding world that Potter fans loved, as well as a moral. The best part, however, is the commentary at the end of each tale by Albus Dumbledore. It adds more insight into the history and culture of the world that harbored Harry Potter, as well as the humorous, dry wit that is such a major part of Dumbledore's character. My only complaint is that Rowling only wrote five tales!
B00129H7VS|5.0|This series has helped me gain a better grasp of how their experiences in World War II shaped the lives of my father and my uncles and their families, not to mention the people of France and Germany. The DVDs were great, but the Blu-ray version is even more gripping in its realistic detail.
B001GMH8TM|5.0|I can't wait for The Truman show to be released on blu-ray. This movie is so well acted and such an original story line.
1416594884|4.0|John Le Carre's \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" has much to say about the upheaval in the post-911 moral universe. Previous fans of Le Carre who reveled in the \\"West good/ Communist bad\\" genre of spy novels may be unprepared for the complexities of the post-Cold War age presented in this novel.     Some reviews at this post have decried it as pro-Islamic. Only if you define as pro-Islamic any work which shows that people of an Islamic ideology can be as righteous or self-righteous, as driven and confused, as focused and fragile as any other people.     This is a well-written tale. The characters are given depth enough for us to feel that we know them, but not so much as to distract from the fast-moving plot. This is what readers expect in a spy novel, and Le Carre delivers masterfully.     As an American reader, I found the ending to be a cold, hard slap in the face. And yet I cannot call it unjustified. If our government is of the people, by the people, and for the people, then we are responsible for the actions of our government and all its agencies, even underground ones.  What Le Carre has given us is a spy novel that makes you think.
B0000TG9E2|1.0|The movie is great... I have no problems with that. What was bad was that when I received my order it was very obvious that it was a fake copy. It was not an original Disney Copy. I was very upset. I have never ordered anything from that seller again. BE CAREFUL with who you order stuff from. When you find a good seller stick with them.

One thing I would have liked to hear more of is some of the instrumental pieces. Guess I'll have to buy the other \\"score\\" CD. No biggie. Definitely 5 stars still!!
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston's debut album is still their best.  All 8 songs here are in regular rotation on Classic Rock stations across the country.  The perfect road trip album.<br /><br />I discovered Boston a little backwards.  I first started to pay attention to music in Junior High in 1986.  Back then Boston's hit \\"Amanda\\" was huge on the radio.  I LOVED that song.  I went out and bought the album \\"Third Stage\\".  After that I wanted to learn more about the group and I notice that it said in the liner notes that it took over 6 years to make the album so I sought out the album before it \\"Don't Look Back\\" and then last discovered this debut.  Though all of their albums are pretty good quality I have found that this album was their most consistent and based on the fact that I have heard every one of these songs on classic rock radio it almost feels like it's a greatest hits album.<br /><br />If you are new to 70s rock and you are trying to start a collection of 70s classic rock albums this should be the first album to start your collection.
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice is a very well written example of the deterioration Alzheimer's causes, and how it can affect the victim, their friends and family.  At the beginning we see Alice at her near intellectual and social peak.  Slowly she starts to notice worrisome mental lapses of various sorts.  After many tests the diagnosis comes back, and she and her family begin the process of planning for the expected effects that will befall Alice.  We also see how those plans get shattered, and even how some beneficial surprises come of the experience, especially in the relationship with one of her daughters.  Genova's experience in neuroscience clearly shine in her representation of the trials and tribulations of Alzheimer's Disease.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Perfect road trip album that makes 80 minutes feel like only a half hour past.  The \\"1\\" disk compilation of Beatles hits.  This compilation is very enjoyable since each song is better than the one before it.  Yes there are some great classic Beatles songs missing but for a one disk overview this it is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I think I own almost every song that the Beatles recorded and do to the remastering I tend to gravitate toward this collection and \\"Love\\".
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I saw the trailers and I thought this show looked uninteresting. Then, probably around midseason, there was a mini-marathon on AMC, and I caught all the first few episodes. Instantly hooked. Finished the entire season, under the spell and alure of this show. It's light years better than anything else on tv. You can have your Nip/Tuck, your Grey's Anatomy your lame crime drama shows and all that other mindless garbage on television, this show is the real deal.    The characters are all played exceptionally well...Bryan Cranston deserved the emmy he received for his dramatic role of Walter White, the conservative family man who takes on an entire new edge to better the means of his family. I'm not going to go too into the plot in this review, instead I'd rather just examine what I like about it and the high points of the show.     The remainder of the supporting cast is fantastic. I believe compelling dynamics existing between the characters is a lost art in modern day television. This show is rock solid in delivering those dynamics. For example, the relationship with Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul) seems simple on the surface, but is often prone to more complex layers. This is very evident in their simple conversations and interactions, such as when they formulate plans or deal with conflicts. One of the more truly defining moments in their relationship occurs when White visits Pinkman in the hospital after Pinkmans' initial meeting with Tuco, sociopathic drug kingpin.     It should also be noted that there is also a little something extra and special to be found in the series, as the actor that plays White's son is not only meant to have cerebral palsy for his character, but the actor himself truly does have cerebral palsy. For this, I commend the actor, Mittes, for his bravery and talent. Definitely a favorite moment of mine is when White and his wife notice some mean-spirited high schoolers mocking his son's handicap while clothes shopping. White, who at this point is living dangerously, takes it upon himself to settle things in an aggressive manner, the opposite of what his predictable self would have done prior to his new, edgy lifestyle.     The other character that truly intrigues me is Tuco, the drug kingpin with psychotic tendencies. The actor (Raymond Cruz, I believe) is extraordinary in portraying the dangerous and remorseless personality typical of a drug kingpin. The ending to the first season was brilliant, both with scripted lines and the physical acting, the restrained emotion and horror that both Pinkman and White exhibit upon witnesing the brutal beatdown. Also, it was a perfect lead-in to the the next season, leaving fanatic viewers such as myself salivating for what very well may be a rollercoaster of a next season, and sympathetic in understanding that White and Pinkman nonverbally and unemotionally express with subtle body language and nondescript facial expressions that they know they are probably in for a devestating adventure. I credit the writers and the artists behind the genius for creating an infinitely superior product.     Ive never connected so well with a fictional concept. This show has definite human elements, and still manages to be exceptionally entertaining. A rare commodity. I couldn't be more excited about the dvd hitting shelves in late Feb, the second season, whenever it arrives, and utterly engrossed in something on television. Not sure how long it's going to last, but I consciously disregard that thought and enjoy something special while it lasts.     Paris,
B000002JPA|5.0|My favorite metal album<br /><br />Back in 1992 I was starting college and I would go to school and then work at the local hardware store until 9:30pm.  I had a lot of energy still and I started listening to a hard rock radio station on my way home.  Through most of the 80s I was so into pop music it was a nice change for me to start listening to something different.  One day this song came on the radio called \\"Pull Me Under\\".  I instantly loved it and back in '92 the song was on quite a bit.  I loved it so much I went out and bought the album.  To my surprise I loved every song on this album which is rare.  Some of the stand outs to me are \\"Take the Time\\", Metropolis\\", and \\"Another Day.  To this day this album is still on my \\"essential\\" album list which I can't say about many albums I bought at the time, even albums by some of my favorite bands haven't held up this well.<br /><br />What really sold me on this album is the talent of the entire band.  Though I am not a musician I can tell these guys really know their stuff.  The complexity of the songs have really helped keep my interest.  Also the song writing is top notch as well dealing with topics not covered in a lot of popular music.<br /><br />If I am in the mood for some fast pace fun rock music this is the one I go to every time.  Yes, it sounds a little dated but I think despite the heavy use of Synth, I think it has held up very well and at least to me this is a classic.  If you are someone who doesn't care for metal check out the samples because this album is very accessible to non metal fans like me.
B000I0QM04|5.0|Granted, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is not the greatest movie ever made, but to truly appreciate the film process and special effects in this film, watch the regular DVD, then the Blue-Ray. Not only will it give you a better appreciation of the film, but this will convince you, if you are not convinced already, that there is a huge difference between a regular DVD and a Blue-Ray disc. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow give remarkable performances considering that nothing they worked with was real. Angelina Jolie as \\"Franky\\" gives a great performance as usual. The story drags at times, but the \\"look\\" of this movie keeps you wanting to watch. The P-40 Warhawk I think steals the show. It is a great looking plane.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|This is by far my favorite superhero movie so I feel bad giving it just 4 stars but I really feel that the 2 disk edition is a waste of money.<br /><br />First the movie:  What makes this movie great is they avoided making it campy and cheesy as many superhero movies do.  This movie looks and feels like these are real people which makes the main villain the Joker that much more scary. It kinda helps that Batman doesn't have any supernatural powers.  A lot of TLC was done during the production of this movie to make it something special that I believe in a few short years will make this a classic and I think it already will be the measuring stick that all future comic book movies will be measured by.<br /><br />Okay, the reason why I took off a stars is the bonus features on the 2 disk set.  When I first saw this movie in the theaters the first thing I thought was how great it would be to hear audio commentary for this movie.  There is NO commentary track.  This probably means that in a few months they will come out with a special edition that will \\"correct\\" this oversight.  As mentioned by other reviews, the special features are very skimpy.  Most of the special features are the fake news reports that were used to promote the movie online and on things like \\"On Demand\\" where I originally saw them.  They sadly really aren't that interesting.  There are two short documentaries that are no more than 20 minutes long combined that could have easily fit on Disk one.<br /><br />The one plus to the 2 disk set is the digital copy.  I watched the digital copy of the movie on my iMac yesterday and what was really fun is during the scenes that were filmed in IMAX the scene filled my screen without the black bars.  I had seen this film on IMAX so it reminded me of how the scenes would switch in the theater between full screen to widescreen.<br /><br />This is a must own movie for Batman fans but unless you want the fake news clips and the digital download then it is best you buy the one disk version of this film.ilm.

B0015HOFZI|4.0|I haven't had a turntable for years, but I still have five feet of shelf space dedicated to rare vinyl recordings.  I sold my last turntable, a Bang & Olufsen, when I discovered that my new audio system lacked a phono input.  I finally decided that it was time to get some of that rare music on iTunes.  I have never gone wrong with a Sony purchase and to be able to purchase equipment and software for $109 delivered was quiet a surprise.  I've paid more than that for a stylus!  Installation of the software and equipment is a snap, it even has RCA out which is more of an eyesore since I doubt anyone has plans to use the turntable on their audio system.  It has faux professional styling with it's metal platter and front feet.  Actually, it is a fairly standard semi-automatic turntable like might be included with a cheaper system of the eighties -- but that's all it has to be since the software can enhance and restore the recording.  Only downside for me is that Mac software is not available.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|I am in love with Duffy! The vocie, the sound, the lyrics, the mood - this is by FAR one of the best albums to come out in 2008. The 60's Soul music sound works perfectly with Duffy's sultry voice. Although I usually only listen to country music and Big Band/Easy Listening (such as Frank Sinatra, Michael Buble), Duffy has been on repeat, non-stop, since I bought her cd.    Favorite Songs: Hanging On Too Long, Stepping Stone, Warwick Avenue, Delayed Devotion and I'm Scared.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|There was one good thing to come out of the Evil Unholy Writers' Strike of 2007-2008. With eternity in their hands, Joss Whedon and cohorts were able to write and produce the supremely awesome DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG, which was streamed online in a series of three webisodes during July 2008. First time around, there were so many hits on the site that the server crashed. If you're Joss Whedon (and cohorts), that's a mighty good thing.<br /><br />\\"For every day, there is a night. For every world, there is an underworld. And for every hero, there's... this guy.\\" As may be discerned from the teaser trailer's voiceover, Bill a.k.a. Dr. Horrible doesn't have a lot of supervillain street cred. But, as indicated by his video blogs and his responses to all those snarky e-mails, he's a hopeful mad scientist, a man with a plan. Dr. Horrible has got two things on his plate (well, three, if you count his fine-tuning of his evil laugh - dude's got a voice coach, even). He feels fairly good about his most recent application to the Evil League of Evil. And he's only weeks away now from mustering the nerve to actually chat up his laundromat crush, the pure and beauteous Penny. That is, if things don't get ruined by that narcissistic superhero Captain Hammer (or as Dr. Horrible puts it: \\"Captain Hammer, corporate tool!\\"). Because, lately, not only is Captain Hammer foiling Dr. Horrible's schemes, but now he's also wooing (the pure and beauteous) Penny.<br /><br />I never do this, brother, but as soon as I got done watching this one, I immediately went and saw it again. DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is a hilarious supervillain send-up that features a sweet love story at its core. As well as plenty of very nice singing. If, like me, you Joss Whedon fans were hankering for more shows like Buffy's classic musical episode \\"Once More With Feeling,\\" this bunch of webisodes is as good as it gets. Just be prepared for that lousy thing which Joss Whedon does at times.<br /><br />In case you don't already know, these collected webisodes only add up to 42 minutes, so factor this in before you buy this DVD and then bellyache about the meager running time. Joss Whedon directs the thing, and co-writes the wittily-turned story and the terrific songs. I don't think I've ever seen Neil Patrick Harris so endearing, as the hapless supervillain in love, or Nathan Fillion so wonderfully, purposely cheesy and over-the-top as the self-serving Captain Hammer. Personally, I had no idea that ol' Doogie Howser can carry a tune, but dude is great and sings my favorite tune here, \\"My Freeze Ray.\\" Also very key to the story is Felicia Day's performance as the sweet and innocent Penny. Day happens to rock that doe-eyed Claire Forlani look, and, after this, I'm intrigued enough by her that I mean to look up her online web-series The Guild. Buffy fans may recognize her as Vi, one of the potential Slayers (or not, she didn't really have a big part in Buffy).<br /><br />Word is that the cast & crew worked for nothing to get DR. HORRIBLE done; the hope is that the DVD release will make enough profit to compensate everyone. The prospects seem to be bright. Anyway, the bonus features are damn spiffy: \\"Commentary! The Musical\\" is the very cool, innovative, and kinda insane cast & crew commentary done up in song (keep an ear out for \\"Ten Dollar Solo,\\" Nathan Fillion's \\"I'm Better Than Neil,\\" Zach Whedon's funky rap and \\"Nobody Wants To Be Moist\\"); also, the more typical commentary track by Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, Felicia Day, Josh, Zack, & Jed Whedon, and co-writer Maurissa Tancharoen; three featurettes comprising the Making Of stuff: \\"The Movie\\" (7:51 minutes), \\"The Music\\" (7:22 minutes) & \\"What Just Happened?\\" (5:27 minutes, concerning the cult popularity and public fallout of the Dr. Horrible webisodes); the ten Evil League of Evil application videos submitted by fans (30:45 minutes, with standout entries from Mr. Terrible, Princess Zombie, the Reverend, and Movie Monkey); and the teaser trailer that was initially released on the [...]<br /><br />(Lastly, at present, the DR.

B0017ANAZO|1.0|This movie is bad. Considering the cast, it is the type of movie where good actresses go to die. Avoid this remake and watch the original instead.
1423107233|5.0|Great high quality book with large pages that allow the reader to experience the level of detail and care that the artists took with these story boards. Could have used a little extra text in the book in order to describe who drew the particular boards and some back story.  Will be purchasing further books in the series.
B001E7OO2I|1.0|i love john ledgend but i really do think that his attempt to come up with different sounds where horrible in this instance. i liked 1 and a half songs and didn't know that that was possible, was told by several people (whom i didn't know) that it was a good cd but i personally thought it was crap.
B0012236SS|5.0|When i first bought this LP in vinyl format a thousand years ago I thought is was great.  The songs are great for a variety of moods.  This version of the album come with tracks that are remastered in 2006.  Compare 9 tracks on vinyl to 17 in this release.  Better then the original,classic mode better sound and more tracks.  It's a buy.  There are songs on this album I couldn't find elsewhere.
0385340990|5.0|I read this book in one day (Yeah, I'm retired). It's by far the best book I read in 2008.  The same day I ordered four copies from Amazon to give as Christmas gifts. I just wish I could read it for the first time!
0385339585|4.0|I'm not a big fan of the mainstream prolific writers, who seem to have one good book, and then publish a new one every 4-6 months, with none of the new ones nearly as good as the first. Rightly or wrongly, I put Grisham in this category for the most part, having loved The Firm, then so-so on the next few.<br /><br />I picked The Testament up off a shelf at a fishing lodge in Northern Quebec, where I found myself disappointed with the books I had taken with me. I had a day early in the trip, which was rainy, windy, and cold, and having just recovered from an ear infection, I decided to stay in for the day. Picked this up on a whim after breakfast, and found myself still reading it at lunchtime. Finished it the next day. Although, another legal theme, this books story was quite off beat, and absolutely enjoyable reading. Loved it.
B000000OF6|5.0|Surprisingly enough i was not a great Queen fan until i saw a South African production titled \\"Queen at the Opera\\" which re-created their hit songs in an operatic twist.  It was an one act musical of 60 minutes that blew my mind - as it did the rest of the audience who, for the first time ever in my theatrical experience, rose as one at the end of the show to give the performers' a standing ovation.  The show could have and should have toured Broadway and the West End (it excelled by far \\"We Will Rock You\\") and it would have run for years.  From this unexpected initiation I became a fan of Freddie and the band for life and this Greatest Hits compilation does great justice to the phenomenal that is Queen. . .
B00003CXIP|5.0|I'm an 80's kid and I love this movie. I own the standard and special edition version of this movie. I'm waiting for the blu-ray release. If you haven't seen this movie and you're born in the 70's definitely purchase this. My favorite part was the leeches and the story telling by the camp fire.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived much faster than I thought it would. Thank You
B00003ZKS1|5.0|The black album cover with the red MSG and the black & white guitar on it is from MSG's 1981 release.  This is the album I thought I was ordering.  What was shipped was the 1980 MSG release with Michael in the doctor's chair.      AMAZON HAS THE WRONG COVER ART ATTACHED TO THE 1980 MSG RELEASE.      This caused me to inadvertantly order a second and pointless copy of MSG's 1980 release. BOTH OF THESE ALBUMS ARE GREAT (and both clearly deserve a five star rating), but I wanted one of each and not two copys of the same.  I will never place another cd in my cart without closely checking the track listings.      THE LESSON IS - ALWAYS CHECK THE TRACK LISTINGS!
1857151399|5.0|Years ago, while on a midnight flight to the United Kingdom, I read a strange book about a young man named  Meursault. So emblematic of my life was his story, that I wrote my name on the inside cover, and dated it.<br />The Outsider, is one of those novels, or experiences, that one rarely happens upon during the course of their existence. It serves no purpose except the attestation, that as esoteric and nonsensical life may be, it really ISN'T JUST YOU - however exceedingly remote that is to believe.<br />Meursault, died for truth, in the absolute sense, unlike per say, Sir Thomas Moore, who also died for truth, but of a different kind, and with heroic pretensions to his actions. But I am not kine to graze that field, and in those hackneyed words, we hear time and time again,  \\"....that is a story for another time.\\"
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I went crazy in the theater watching this movie.  Would highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Batman.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Has all the characteristics of a great martial arts movie, including a very wise teacher. Jealous senior students.<br /><br />Bad student who went to the dark side, but in whom the force runs strong.<br /><br />And they did it all with ordinary old cartoons!<br /><br />Perfectly okay for all ages, and everybody in the family will enjoy it.<br /><br />Old boring dad saves the day, and the kid nobody believed in becomes a hero and beats the bad guy.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful movie!
B000V8I2QU|1.0|Finally got a chance to hear this on loan from my local library.  Others might do the same if curious and spare the grief of listening as if Phil Spector's downstairs neighbor.  I am terribly disappointed in Mr. Springsteen for this recent entry into his discography as it's merit will forever fail on the overtly compressed production engineering tapped only for the mp3 age.  It certainly makes 'Nebraska' and it's living room production a 5 star and the initially flawed mastering on Columbia's first 'Born to Run' compact disc seem just pristine.  Now unfortunately producer O'Brian is at the helm of the new 'Working on a Dream'.    As for \\"C. Perry\\" review re: >It's overproduced and almost unlistenable. It has violins. Violins on a Springsteen album!!!!! < check Suki Lahav - thems good violins!!!!!
B000NY12LO|5.0|I highly recommend this book for whoever is a little bit weird, unpopular, and different. this is my fav book of all time. READ IT. you'll thank me
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the best WW11 shows. I was able to purchase it at a great price and only paid three dollars for shipping. If you like WW11 movies this is a must see. The packaging is great for storing all of the discs. This is a fantastic deal.
B001M5UDGS|3.0|The actual material was awesome, but I wish there was more on it. The ELE submissions varied between being jaw dropping awesome, and just terrible (in a bad way), as in I couldn't figure out why they were chosen for this DVD. My main gripe is that my DVD doesn't work most of the time, and I JUST opened it yesterday. The first viewing, and it skips, freezes, the sound doesn't come on in certain parts...and the DVD itself is just terrible. A brand new DVD shouldn't skip, freeze, and lack sound in parts all together during the first viewing. Is it just my copy that does this, or are all of them poorly made in this way? If it's just mine, how do I get a replacement?
0060723513|5.0|This story is heartwarming and intelligent.  I didn't want the book to end. Marlo Morgan provides us with insight into how a gentler world could be.
0446401307|3.0|I know this was originally published as a serial, but it still feels like it hasn't been fleshed out enough.  The Overlook is my introduction to Harry Bosch.  As a new reader, the constant referrals to the previous novel in the series got old quick.  It made me feel like I shouldn't have been reading this book, even though it clearly stands alone.  Likable book, even if it was a bit sparse.<br /><br />Harry, so far, is an enjoyable character.  I'll most likely be back for more.
B001EZ78T6|5.0|Shipping was good, cd was pretty good, and the dvd was ok also, not to great, but ok 2 watch. i think its pretty boring, he talks about all the songs, interesting, but boring.
0380730405|4.0|Rebecca de Winter is dead when this story begins, and yet is its strongest character. She haunts the second Mrs. de Winter (whose first name we never learn) even before her arrival at Manderley. Convinced that Mr. de Winter is still in love with Rebecca, she allows herself to be completely undone by the prospect of stepping into Rebecca's shoes. She is scared witless by Mrs. Danvers, the overbearing and creepy housekeeper, who remains devoted to Rebecca and determined to keep everything at Manderly just the way it was before Rebecca died.<br /><br />To be fair, Mr. de Winter seems to give absolutely no consideration of the fact that she might feel out of her league and doesn't seem to even notice her distress. However, even when the de Winters finally start communicating and things look like they might work out, she continues to act like a nitwit. It's very hard to sympathize which such a protagonist, but that aside, this is an excellent work of suspense.
B001MWMVQQ|5.0|I started watching the very first episode because I knew it was going to be good.  Fringe is like a combination of X-Files and Lost with vivid characterizations, edgy subject matter and wild stories that leave you wanting more.  I would recommend to all Sci-Fi geeks and Crime thriller enthusiasts!!
B001FB55MG|3.0|The critics didn't much like this film, but what do they know? All I can say is that my kids had a lot of fun and, in spite of a few misgivings, I did too. It's got all the inventive and enjoyable moments that made [[ASIN:B000NOKJC2 Night at the Museum]] fun -- but adds to the mix the absurd \\"throw logic and PC out the window\\" style of a toned-down-for-the-whole-family Adam Sandler comedy.<br /><br />The film takes the irreverent, smart-alecky but down-on-his-luck schlub that Adam Sandler plays in almost every one of his films, and places him smack dab in the center of a Disney fairy tale. Skeeter is an overworked and underappreciated hotel employee, the true heir to his father's hotel, who is taken advantage of by the evil usurper Kendall (Guy Pearce) and overlooked by the princess Violet (Teresa Palmer). He will have to prove his mettle and win the rights to the hotel using his wits, imagination and a little Disney magic.<br /><br />The magic comes from the fact that everytime he tells a bedtime story to his over-protected niece and nephew, their contributions to the story somehow come true the next day. This is both good and bad for him. Gumballs falling from the sky are fine, and a fun touch. But an angry dwarf kicking him in the shin is not so much fun, for him at least. The nice thing about this is it gives a \\"rationale\\" for the absurd and illogical coincidences that are par for the course in Adam Sandler films -- and it reminds you that at bottom his humor is exactly the kind of humor that children come up with. Only that in most of his other films it would be kids with a nasty sense of humor and a foul mouth -- here, for the most part, it is all good clean fun. Sure he makes fun of vegetarians and environmentalists, but he makes fun of capitalist greed as well. It's all good, and not bad at all.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|This movie was very well written and would be appropriate for children and young adults alike.
B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely love this movie so much that I purchased one for my Mother. It just get's better and better every time you watch it... I would highly recommend it.
0307455874|5.0|i bought this book for a friend that lives in jamaica & i am sure he will enjoy it
0385340567|1.0|This is what can happen after an author has had a good degree of success -- they start to deviate from the formula that made them successful.  Rather than polute this series, I recommend Lee Child start another series devoted entirely to his political, religous or other views that the world is waiting to learn about with baited breath.  Then, when he's gotten it all out of his system, he can return to writing the Reacher novels we all know and love.
0956010903|5.0|My aunt got me this as a combination of my seventeenth birthday and Christmas gift. Let me just tell you, I almost started crying.     It is by far the stand out gift of the year and I will cherish it for years and years to come, eventually passing it on to my children and their children after that.             ...I can't stop looking/touching/talking about it.
0545128285|4.0|In the last Harry Potter book the main characters find truth from a old wizarding fairy tale.  This book includes that story, \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers,\\" as well as four other tales.  They always have a moral, although they are sometimes more disturbing than the fairy tales we muggles routinely tell our children.  Each story concludes with a commentary by Albus Dumbledore, occasionally footnoted by Rowling.      Quote: \\"The heroes and heroines who triumph in his stories are not those with the most powerful magic, but rather those who demonstrate the most kindness, common sense, and ingenuity.\\"    My only beef with Beedle is that there is not enough of it - the small book can only re-whet your appetite for all the good Harry Potter times that have gone before you.  The little collection (whose profits go towards a children's charity founded by the author) gives the reader the impression that Rowling can just not quite quit the wizarding world - and I'll continue to pick up whatever scraps of Harry Potter-dom she can dish out.
1596434252|2.0|there are 26 letters in the alphabet.  about 10 of the pop-ups are really clever,  and the rest are merely a block letter in 3-D.  the cover is more fun than what's inside.
