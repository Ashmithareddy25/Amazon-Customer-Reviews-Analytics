0446547603|5.0|Excellent! This book pulls at the heart, as does all Nicholas Sparks books. I loved the characters right away, even though I didn't know many of their details until later in the book. I wanted to put life on hold till I finished the book. Thanks, Mr. Sparks, for another great read!

B00005JKHN|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter watches this over and over. I love the DVD format and was thrilled at the great condition this arrived in as I purchased it used. Although the story is timeless, the music and singing are very operatic, which is fine because it was so well done. Indeed, it's great to have a mix of styles within our Disney Collection. Besides, how can a kid really enjoy Sleeping Beauty's Castle at Disneyland and on every Disney movie if they don't see this wonderful story?

0345803493|5.0|I normally do not give books 5 stars but this book earned this rating and then some. Book one left me hanging and prompted me to buy book 2 just to see what happened. The story was most definately better than the first book. I fould that Ana wasn't weak at all, just young and inexperienced. Christian wasn't evil at all just scared and misunderstood. The book really let you see how messed up Christian really was and I loved how Ana's character dealt with his issues. This book had me from start to finish. Great story and it is most definately on my re-read list.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|When I first started reading this book I was a little bored. Ana seemed weak and Christian seemed evil. I kept thinking this was going to be a typical BDSM book. Dom teaches Sub, Sub obeys Dom you know the drill. This book caught me by surprise and truthfully the ending is what pushed me to purchase book two, just to see what happened. Overall this book was a good start to the Trilogy. This is on my re-read list.
1401235417|3.0|Batman Volume 1: The Court of Owls is a hardbound collection of the first seven issues of DC's \\"new 52\\" Batman. It briefly re-introduces the Batman family of heroes (and villains), then heads into a new story arc dealing with either a very old and unknown or a very deceptive villainous group (The Court of Owls). The story is NOT resolved by the end of this volume, however - you'll just have to read the individual comics (or a future collected work) to see how it ends.<br /><br />There are A LOT of things to love about this collected work. To begin with, the artwork is spectacular - I can't remember Batman's world ever looking better (or, in some cases, darker). Many of the individual storylines are riveting. The creators also did a great job of conveying Batman's emotions to the reader, especially the confusion and chaos of a certain situation (not gonna spoil that for you - you'll know when you read it). There are definitely a number of great aspects to this book.<br /><br />But there are also things Batman fans may not like. The big one is the villains (The Court of Owls) - you're either going to be able to accept them and their level of power or find them unbelievably cheesy. I found them cheesy. Too overpowered and, in some respects, too much like previous villains. The New 52 Batman seems to be having his personality and identity reworked as well - there are a number of weird similarities to Tony Stark/Iron Man that pop up (again, you'll know them when you see them). Finally, too many events and plot twists occur unrealistically even for a comic book - at least for my tastes.<br /><br />Rating: 3 out of 5 Stars. I can recommend this volume to Batman and comic book fans alike due to the exceptional artwork and stellar presentation, but not everyone will love the storyline.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was by far the best series I have ever read. Book one started off slow and picked up steam by book two and was in full swing by book three. I found myself feeling sad that the story was coming to an end. I can't express how awesome this story was. It had the perfect amount of intimacy and intrigue. I found myself getting pissed right along with Ana when Christian would mess up. I found myself actually laughing out loud at some parts of the book and crying at others. The author did an awesome job. If you don't read this series you are doing yourself a dis-service. Most definately on my re-read list. pick it up you will be glad. Those who love BDSM this book is not that descriptive on that. If you don't like BDSM you will be able to read this story without difficulty. It really is a great story.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|My [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]] is a tough little unit so far--I haven't actually dropped it yet, but I've carried in my coat around town, in a busy laptop case, and on a car seat on long drives. So if I'm going to invest in a case, it better do more than simply protect the device. The Marware Vibe is a basic case with a few handy features.<br /><br />I plucked it off the Vine first and foremost because of its ability to act as a bookstand. The cover articulation is simple and it works, but is designed for `landscape' orientation. The case is generally unsuitable for standing the Fire in `portrait', but it will work in a pinch if you really need to view something in that mode. I find the former handy for browsing the net while playing a game or writing a paper. I can also use the stood-up Fire to type notes with a stylus while reviewing a game or a movie. However, take care not to tap the touch screen too hard because it causes the cover to bend. Over time, I imagine the folds of the cover will weaken; however, it is shaped so that the bottom of the Kindle touches the non-skid pad on the inside cover to help keep it in place.<br /><br />That non-skid pad is also handy for placing things. I've got thick, manly fingers so hitting buttons on my Fire can sometimes be a mashfest. The [[ASIN:B004GCJEZU AmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices]] is a good supplement and it sticks to the pad well enough. I can tilt at about 30 degrees before the weight starts to slip it down. Dirt and dust also sticks to the pad very well, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />The trim size of the case suits the device. It doesn't overlap, which also means there no handy place to tuck a stylus or a pen--even the spine is too tight. I was able to tuck the encased Kindle into my Levi's denim jacket inside pockets, and walk around listening to music. Completely filling my pocket, the assembly didn't bulge, though it was still noticeable if the jacket was being bent or blown.<br /><br />Inside the case, the four point attachment harness is a cheap plastic and it gets the job done. Shaped like a letter \\"H\\" it Holds the unit steady and the four clip points are easy to snap on and off. The elastic band is tight enough to keep the case closed, but like all such bands I've encountered on consumer products, looks and feels like it will hyperextend after a couple years.<br /><br />The Vibe is one of several Marware cases for the Kindle Fire, retailing at about 25 bucks. While there is no pocket or clip for a stylus, and no zipper or magnetic latch, you could do a lot worse for your five-and-twenty payment. Just like it looks on the product page, the case feels and opens like a hardcover book.the case, the four point attachment harness is a cheap plastic and it gets the job done.

This apparently, is the first book to cover the practical legal and administrative implications of the new planning regime, which, in the opinion of most, represents the most radical reform applied to the UK planning system in the last 40 years.<br /><br />The authors, Simon Ricketts and Duncan Field, who were the original `L is for Localism' bloggers, have set out to explain and comment upon the various legislative and policy changes brought about by this  important and pivotal piece of legislation.<br /><br />The veritable mountain of material has been, as explained in the foreword, `broken down into a series of topics, explaining each in a clear and open way....'  Clarity is indeed one of the hallmarks of this book, which, no doubt will become indispensible to anyone involved in -- or interested in -- planning.<br /><br />The new localism legislation emerged as a natural consequence of the UK's new coalition government's Big Society', widely, if partially defined as `reducing the role of central Government in favour of local determination and delivery of services.'<br /><br />The overall aim of the legislation therefore, is to de-centralise what evolved, to the alarm of many, as the centralized corporate state, under previous Labour governments.<br /><br />Among the many harbingers of change in the opposite direction was, for example, the `Better Homes, Greener Cities' report of 2006,  which stressed that `the planning system should be localised... made more flexible, with greater freedom to change between planning designations and an extension of permitted development rights'.<br /><br />No doubt with these thoughts in mind, the new coalition government, which came to  power in May 2010, championed an ethos in which, so to speak, local government calls the shots regarding such issues as densities, green belt designation and the like, largely independent of centralist control.  Radical?  Absolutely -- and not without controversial implications!<br /><br />The book's extensive and detailed table of contents lists a host of topics, from local authorities' powers and duties... to' navigating the system'.<br /><br />Significantly, the chapter on community empowerment includes sections on local referendums and community right to challenge.  There's much more besides contained in this important work of reference which is extensively footnoted for your further research. Also, as you would expect, there are tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, plus four appendices and detailed index.  The law is stated as at May 2012.im of the legislation therefore, is to de-centralise what evolved, to the alarm of many, as the centralized corporate state, under previous Labour governments.<br /><br />Among the many harbingers of change in the opposite direction was, for example, the `Better Homes, Greener Cities' report of 2006,  which stressed that `the planning system should be localised... made more flexible, with greater freedom to change between planning designations and an extension of permitted development rights'.<br /><br />No doubt with these thoughts in mind, the new coalition government, which came to  power in May 2010, championed an ethos in which, so to speak, local government calls the shots regarding such issues as densities, green belt designation and the like, largely independent of centralist control.

1845921046|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moSMRLFX2759MQ]]<br /><br />FOR CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCY PRACTITIONERS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />With many businesses having gone global, the problems of insolvency are compounded and magnified when the issues that emerge extend across borders.  Yet, as Richard Sheldon QC, the general editor of this important work of reference points out, the law on cross border insolvency began its evolution as early as the eighteenth century, with the then spectacular growth of international trade.<br /><br />We were particularly intrigued by his account of the landmark decision of Solomons v Ross in 1760 when, among a number of events, the wonderfully and appropriately named `Chamber of Desolate Estates' in Amsterdam appointed curators (or assignees) of the debtors' property in the case.  For further details you'll need to acquire this fascinating book.<br /><br />`Cross Border Insolvency' deals with the full spectrum of  issues pertaining to the subject, from the UNCITRAL model law, to  jurisdictional issues, to enforcement of judgments and orders made in foreign insolvency proceedings, to matters of priorities and set-off --and of course, much more.<br /><br />This third edition builds on the pivotal work of Professor Smart who produced the first two editions and would presumably have produced a third but for his untimely death.  An expert team from South Square -- known as the leading insolvency and restructuring set of chambers in the UK -- has taken over the work of producing this third edition.<br /><br />The result is, as Sheldon describes: `a comprehensive and up-to-date consideration of the topic of cross-border insolvency', (internationally and at common law) `incorporating where still relevant the work carried out by Professor Smart.'<br /><br />Significant changes to the law since the second edition have been incorporated.  In addition to the number of new chapters, there are many that have been rewritten to reflect recent developments in the law. The contributors to each meticulously researched and footnoted chapter are clearly identified, each presenting an individual view.<br /><br />Where there are expressions of opinion, these sometimes differ, which does make for interesting discussion and debate on this complex and, yes, often debatable subject.<br /><br />As a work of reference, the book is easy to use, containing as it does a detailed and logically laid out table of contents and a comprehensive index which makes things easier to look up, when you're under pressure.<br /><br />There are extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, plus a table of material from other jurisdictions (extremely useful, this) and a table of EC and international material. The three appendices include the Insolvency Act 1986.<br /><br />In view of a string of high profile and notorious insolvencies in recent years -- from Maxwell to Madoff to Barings and Lehman -- the publication of this up-to-date edition is timely.<br /><br />Be you an accountant, or lawyer, or a consultant involved in cross-border insolvency, this book belongs in your professional library.

B000UX6THK|3.0|My experience of \\"Twin Peaks\\" is perhaps unique.  My brother died in 1990 a few weeks before the show, which I looked forward to with some anticipation, began.  Not quite ready to face up to Laura Palmer's demise, I taped the first, movie-length episode as well as all the subsequent episodes for about a month.  Therefore, while my co-workers were avidly discussing the show in its early days, I had to tune them out.<br /><br />Eventually, feeling up to the experience, I took a day off from work and watched all the episodes I had taped (a full VHS).  That is the way to enter Twin Peaks.  By the time I watched those episodes, my co-workers were already losing interest in the show and falling to the wayside;  the show had too many characters and its plots were too complex for weekly viewing.  My coworkers were unable to keep up with it and so long interest fast.  In my case, on the other hand, watching the pilot and the first four or five episodes in a marathon tv session set the continuity (such as it is) in my head. Once this is done, the viewer can take his time to luxuriate in the doings of this strange northwestern town.<br /><br />From the first episode, \\"Twin Peaks\\" had a lot of charm and quirky humor to help one through the rougher periods of murder, abduction, etc.  It's too bad it wasted a lot of viewer interest on inconsequential stories and characters.<br /><br />For anyone wanting to see the televised TP, all the episodes are here (even a \\"European\\" version of the pilot, where a solution of sorts to the mystery of Laura Palmer's murder is offered).  Where this Gold Box is incomplete is that it does not include the prequel movie \\"Fire Walk with Me.\\"  That's probably a good thing, since the movie was terrible.  Not including it also eliminates the temptation to watch it first.  \\"Fire\\" gives away the murderer, and the tension of who killed Laura Palmer is really all that sustains the first (short) season.<br /><br />This box does offer several interesting extras.  One is an informative look behind the scenes at making the series.  Another is the reclusive David Lynch himself having a conversation with a couple of cast members (Kyle MacLachlan and the still-beautiful M&auml;dchen Amick), though their talk merely whets one's appetite for more.  All the regular episodes have optional \\"Log Lady\\" introductions (which, incidentally, are, as you might expect, less than helpful;  they often get so silly you can see the actress trying to choke down a laugh from time to time).<br /><br />This Gold Box is the way to visit \\"Twin Peaks.\\"  It allows those necessary marathon sessions that lets the viewer get the story straight.  Simply turn TP on and watch it until you drop off;  then pick it up later and start again.<br /><br />But viewers will probably approach this series out of curiosity for a long-dead cult series that has no life left in it.  when it was being broadcast, once I entered the world of \\"TP\\" I watched the show religiously right up to the last  episode (hoping, near the end, they could pull a rabbit out of a hat).<br /><br />Viewing it again for the first time after twenty years, I was surprised at how boring it all is once one knows the killer's identity.  During the short-lived \\"Twin Peaks\\" craze of 1990 one did not notice how stories were being unnecessarily spun out at length.  These days, many parts of the series resemble jokes that go on too long for their punch-lines to pay off.<br /><br />No spoilers here: but in one of the extras a co-creator of the series, Mark Frost, complains that he and Lynch never intended to expose Laura Palmer's killer, and the network (ABC) forced them to.  If that is so, hurray for the network.  If Frost had gotten his way, by the end of the second season TP would have been nothing more than self-parody.  You can only carry on a \\"Who Killed Laura Palmer?\\" so long before it becomes silly and derided, and the resolution is rendered meaningless.  Watching TP as whole, rather than waitinga week (or a summer) to see the next episode, I think they solved Laura Palmer's murder at just the right moment.  It's too bad they had nothing to put in its place.<br /><br />As admitted in the making-of documentary, having no story to entice viewers back after resolving the murder of Laura Palmer was damning to the series.  (If you want my two cents, they should immediately have delved into the White Lodge/Black Lodge dichotomy, perhaps having everyone in Twin Peaks choose to be in one Lodge or the other for a climactic battle for the soul of the town.)<br /><br />Anyway, watching TP again, by the time Heather Graham entered the cast I was only too ready for the show to peter out.  That's too bad, since TP began as both entertaining and innovative.  Unfortunately, the writers must have preferred adding new characters to the mix as an alternative to inventing and telling good stories.<br /><br />For anyone who has never seen TP, it's probably worth watching all the way through once.  For old Peaksies like me . . . well, I'm fast-forwarding through anything having to do with the paternity of Lucy's baby, or the saga of James Hurley when he leaves town, or . . .  It's intriguing, how little is actually lost from the thrust of the series by excising certain narratives;  and how the series might have been helped at the time by a little judicious pruning.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved TP once and the Gold Box is a keeper, the way one clings to pictures of old girl or boyfriends.  And it's nice having the disk of extras.a week (or a summer) to see the next episode, I think they solved Laura Palmer's murder at just the right moment.

The book covers her life from a child in NJ through her growth into an artist rocker while living in NYC.  The book drops some names who were part of this counter culture of the times. Patti does not go into too much detail about Robert and his sexuality but does write about his struggles and growth as an artist quite nicely.

The writing style was great and I enjoyed the description offered by the author, but the characters fell flat for me and the plot was weak and a bit juvenile.

B005NPBT5M|3.0|Pink Floyd \\"The Wall\\" is my all-time favorite album. If I had to bring one CD (or a set of CDs, in this case), that's the one I'd bring.<br /><br />The CD issued over twenty years ago was very, very good. It sounded quite like the original LP. The insert was not bad at all. It's true that 82 minutes makes us think it could have been a single disc if they shortened something there, but no fan in his/her sane mind would want it shortened. If anything, we'd like to see a few bonus tracks instead.<br /><br />The 2011 remaster gave me a shock of horror. Fortunately, I still own my old CD. This new remaster is very stifled, the volume is actually a bit lower, the sound is distorted and hissing noises that not even the old LP had appeared here. The only excuse I can think of is:  the original tapes must be in a pretty bad shape after thirty-odd years. Such a pity.<br /><br />My advice:  try to look for the old version of the CD instead. The sound is much, much better in the old version.

Interestingly, the author specifically tackles psychological hypotheses (backed by many published research articles) that what humans find beautiful is evolutionarily significant, for examples large eyes speaks to innocence and symmetry speaks to healthiness.  Humans innately pick up on the cues, and this is why humans place significant value in beauty.  He does this by creating a world in the future that surgically makes all humans \\"pretty\\" at the age of 16.  The problem is that some humans do not want to be become \\"pretty\\" and choose to stay \\"ugly\\".  Of course, this dissention has consequences.<br />Westerfeld included much science in this story, and I appreciated it as a scientist myself.  Although, there were inconsistencies, such as the idea of primary succession taking 100 0 years due to presence of genetically engineered flowers is silly considering primary succession (new growth) occurs in 100 years after lava flow kills all living things.  Also, the idea that a surgery could make people \\"pretty\\" (perfect in every way, not just facially) and then can be gradually digressed as the people age is ridiculous.  My point is that if science is utilized in a novel it needs to be accurate.  If not, I get annoyed.  I am sure others do as well.<br />Overall, I will be reading the next book in the series.

B007IYF4P2|5.0|An excellent book by a real pioneer in this country of what a real fight was all about. This book and Bruce, himself, started a change in the ideas of the Martial Arts in this country. I really believe that this book and its message was held back by the great success Bruce had as an actor. While he talked reality in 'Tao' the movies, with his flashy kicks and moves, sent a different message. After the Gracies' showed the world what real one on one unarmed combat was all about this book , especially this version, showed more worth to me in the 90s then it did when written and later published. When MMA rules changed making it more of a sport then a street fight, this book became a true classic. I thought this to be an excellent book when it first came out. I like it even more now!<br /><br />Pat\\"Hawk\\"Hardy

B00338QENI|5.0|This book is absolutely impeccably researched, written beautifully and most important .. this woman, author of this book had the utmost respect for her subject.<br /><br />It is the unbiased true story of Henrietta Lacks and her family.<br /><br />At times I did have to put it down as I myself would become so angered by what had occurred. This, however, is a reflection  upon myself; how I think, feel, and most certainly not the book!<br /><br />I feel that this should most certainly be required reading for any Black Studies class in America. It is an accurate description of a person and events which are not well enough known; or not so before this book.<br /><br />I've found that many people I do know have read this.<br /><br />Just as a note of interest? My own doctor, an internist, did know her proper name. He is involved in research aside from just having a large medical practice, and came to the US from the UK to study with a virologist at Stanford in CA during the 1950's. So, of course he had done some research with other doctors utilizing HeLa cells.  I was impressed that he did, in fact know her name. (I did not get to ask if he'd read the book at the time; was in the middle of it just then, and waved it at him when we crossed paths on my way out of his office when I'd gone in for a routine visit. He seemed to be familiar with the book; I would not be at all surprised if he was another person I know who's read it.<br /><br />Read this book to enlighten yourself.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|After hearing about the Lifeproof cases I started wondering if I should invest in one.  I'm a mom of 2 boys who love to play in sand, dirt, and water, and I like to take pictures of them when they're playing, and it would be nice to have the peace of mind that my phone will be safe if it gets splashed, etc.  I heard many raves from people I know who have a Lifeproof case, but also read reviews that had some complaints so I was skeptical.  I bought my case at Best Buy, knowing they have a 30day return policy so I could test it out and see if I liked it.<br /><br />I took it home, did the water test, and everything seemed fine.  Then I put it on my iphone 4 and tested out using the phone... It looked good and felt fairly protected, but I noticed a few things that I know would just annoy me over time:<br /><br />1. There's a slight gap between the phone screen and the case cover, so it takes a little extra pressure for the phone to \\"feel\\" when I tap the screen, especially near the edges of the phone. Not that big a deal when taping on apps, but I tried typing out a short message and was missing half the letters bc the taps hadn't registered.<br /><br />2. I use my phone to listen to music in the car a lot, and the screw that covers the headphone jack is tiny and kind of a pain to un/screw.  I don't want to be screwing and unscrewing the little cap on all the time, and also know I have a high risk for losing it.<br /><br />Personally, if I'm going to spend $80 on a phone case it needs to be pretty damn close to perfect. Since I don't really intend to go swimming in this case the waterproof protection is nice but not necessary, and the extra annoyances of the screen sensitivity and the earphone jack screw aren't worth the waterproof factor.  So, I'm returning it tomorrow and I think I'll go back to an Otterbox Commuter that at least has the flaps for the jack and charger connection so those can be kept mostly protected from dirt.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best series I've read in years.  The author begins with an excellant, novel approach to this story in Wool - which was intended to be a stand-alone short story. I learned that it was due to his fans that he expanded it into this series. It was the right decision.  The story continues at an amazing pace, keeping the reader thoroughly engaged.  The story unfolds in a somewhat predictable manner, but it is not \\"too predictable\\".  Actually, that is uncharitable - it's not that its predictable, it is that the author avoids using trite surprises to keep the story moving.  What results is a story with a sense of flow, where the reader is living alongside the characters.  I'd happily mention Wool in the same league as Game of Thrones, Ender's Game, and Rendezvous with Rama.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I'm sure some Beach Boys fans are going to read the title of my review and either get mad or shake their heads in disagreement. There is no doubt that there were some fantastic albums by The Beach Boys since Pet Sounds. Quite a few of them, actually. I loved Friends, Surf's Up, Sunflower, and Love You. Every one of their albums has at least one or two (if not more) songs that I love.<br /><br />The thing is, for me, a lot of their albums had at least one or two songs on them that I tended to skip over from time to time. Some tunes were painful to listen to more than once.<br /><br />So far, THAT'S WHY GOD MADE THE RADIO, has none that I'll skip over. Sure, not all of the songs are fantastic, but they're all at least pretty good. I'd say that my least favorites are Beaches In Mind and Daybreak Over The Ocean. Not bad songs at all, but they don't knock my socks off.<br /><br />A lot of reviewers here have raved about the final three songs on here being fantastic and I agree 100%. From There To Back Again is probably my favorite on the album. I think it's fantastic and Al Jardine sounds amazing on it.<br /><br />Other favorites for me are Shelter and Strange World. The latter is growing on me more and more. Great harmonies on that one.<br /><br />If you're a fan of The Beach Boys, you shouldn't hesitate in getting this album. You'll be glad you did. There's not a bad song on it.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|This is the 2nd movie I've watched with Angelina Jolie and I  will certainly be on the lookout for other movies of this caliber with her in them.  Clint Eastwood is great at directing this movie. The subject will scare you a bit because it involves children and mental health issues in a time period when not much was known on how to treat mentally ill patients. You leave wondering if this really could have happened in that time period.  Food for thouht.
0062183591|4.0|\\"The proper study of Mankind is Man,\\" Alexander Pope taught us. And Dan Ariely provides this proper study in spades, in this, his third work of psychological (and personal) introspection.<br /><br />Ariely's writing style is chatty and, like they say in Yiddish, haimische. Explanations of specific experiments (not only the findings, but also the logic behind experimental design) are interspersed with expositions on life in the lab (though not quite so much as in previous books).<br /><br />As a sometime experimental psychologist myself, I couldn't help but twig on what academics call \\"threats to validity\\" in some of the experiments. \\"Is being nicer to a blind person really a function of consistency theory, or is it some variation of pity?,\\" \\"Did the subjects like the paintings more maybe because of ingroup/outgroup effects?,\\" \\"Would low self monitors like computer nerds (or psychologists) have had the same response to high-ticket labels as high self-monitors like MBA students?\\" And so on.<br /><br />I don't want to rag on Ariely too much (we have the same diploma on our walls!). The book will be wonderfully enlightening for laypeople. And engaging in one way or another for everyone.
0800141660|5.0|I NEVER get tired of watching this movie. The story is superb and so is the acting.  Sometimes it's like watching it for the first time.  The movie brings the book to life.  I love the way the English use so many words to express themselves.  It does help that Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant are both English so you're not hearing fake accents. The scenery in the movie is beautiful.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I gave this 3 stars because I read all three books, and I can't, in good conscience, give it a 1 or 2 since for some unfathomable reason, I kept coming back for more.  I think it was probably because I kept hoping there WOULD BE more.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not read the Epilogue at the end of Book 3.  I just couldn't take anymore.<br /><br />As stated in my headline, this is basically erotic romance.  Not having read a lot of that genre, I am guessing that the S&M is what sets this apart.  The author could have cut out two-thirds of the repetitive and, frankly, tiresome sex scenes and fit this all into one book.  Out of three books, it was the rare plot device that had me actively wanting to read on.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele, our femme fatale protagonist, is a child playing grown-up games.  To say she lacks life experience is an understatement.  To say these books require one to suspend disbelief is an even bigger understatement.<br /><br />In general, the entire story that plays out over three volumes can be summed up thusly:  boy meets girl, boy stalks girl, girl feigns disinterest but eventually gives in, refrain: (they have sex, they get mad at each other, they have sex, they get mad at each other, they gush over how much they love each other, they have sex, they get mad at each other) ... Repeat refrain ad nauseum.<br /><br />The author is clever enough to leave things very much unresolved at the end of book one, teasing one to pick up book two (which I did after taking a break for something less sleazy, like a good murder mystery).  I guess I picked up book three in hopes of some sense of closure.  By the time I got to the \\"closure\\" part, I was so bored and tired of these two characters, I couldn't bear to read any further.<br /><br />In sum, I can't really recommend this series, although I'm sure many readers will want to find out what all the fuss is about.  I wish I could explain that, but I'm still a bit clueless.  If you enjoy erotic romance, I'm sure you will enjoy these books.  Otherwise, my advice is to skip it.romance, I'm sure you will enjoy these books.  Otherwise, my advice is to skip it.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Dear Warner Brothers,<br />I am unpleased with my recent purchase of the Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows Blu-ray + DVD + Ultraviolet pack. The fact that the Ultraviolet version is not compatible with my iTunes library renders the purchase useless. There is only one reason to buy these multi format discs and that is to be able to play the content on my devices any where I choose to enjoy them. Had I realized that this was the case before Pre-ordering the movie on Amazon, I would have purchased the Blu-ray only version. That is Amazons fault for not making it clear what we were getting with our pre-order. I have not had this issue with other WB movies purchased so I had no reason to believe there would be an issue and I assume it is a new practice. I also take issue with the fact that it was not made obvious that the \\"Digital Copy\\" was a proprietary format that requires me to sign up for Ultraviolet and Flixster accounts and go through the Rube Goldbergian process of linking those accounts which is, to say the least, not user friendly. I understand that iTunes and Apple are a thorn in the side of both the Music and Movie industries and Ultraviolet is your attempt to wrest control from them, but the fact is it's only making the end consumer angry and frustrated that you don't see consumer satisfaction as what should drive you, not over throwing iTunes. Do the math... there are more iDevices than any other platform out there but you made this movie incompatible with the system that controls those iDevices. I don't see this changing in the near future. Its time to make it JUST WORK.<br /><br />Ultraviolet will only work on a Mac with the download of the Flixster client app and an Ultraviolet account linked to Flixster and will not load into iTunes. So if you hope to use the \\"UV Digital Copy\\" with Apple TV you are out of luck. Have fun getting the two accounts linked together. That process alone took 45 Minutes due to server errors and pages not loading all the way.<br/><br />As for the Movie itself... It is another fantastic mystery wrapped in an enigma, thrill ride. Robert Downey and Jude Law play off each other very well. Great fun.

0307716546|4.0|An older daughter is working in an elementary school.  The school catches fire and a Mother runs into the burning building to save her girl.  This is the story of the daughter and mother after the fire.  Both are now in the hospital and unconscious, both near death.  No one can hear them but they talk to one another and are aware of everything going on in this soul hovering mystery.<br /><br />Next - you guessed it.  Revelations abound as Mother and Daughter watch those closest to them.  What's more, the fire wasn't accidental but deliberately set to hurt the daughter.  The would be murderer continues to go after the daughter as she lay dying in the hospital.  Neither Mom nor Girl can do a thing but watch as the story unfolds.<br /><br />The \\"who done it\\" portion is brilliantly played.  However the tale surrounding that portion is quite predictable and padded.  Personally I enjoyed the tale.  It wasn't fast paced or clever beyond belief but it was OK.
0099579936|5.0|I admit, I have never read a romance novel before, expecially not an \\"erotic\\" novel. I typical read legal novels such as Grisham.  Many of the women with whom I work were reading the books.  One of my associates gave me the first book and I was a bit hesitant to read the \\"naughty books\\" as they were called.  I started reading, and I could not put it down.  All I wanted to do was read all day.  I read the first two books in a week and a half and am excited to start the third novel tonight.  Yes there is allot of sex, but there is an interesting storyline which keeps you very intrigued to find out where Ana and Christian end up.  These are great books, I read the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo series of books quickly and I did not think I would ever find another series as equally captivating,,,, until these Grey books.  Highly recommend reading them, even for the somewhat prudish out there, such as myself.  These books are highly addictive!

0425263908|5.0|OK so I have been on a reading frenzy this summer so I thought that I would read Bared to you as well.....<br /><br />I was absolutely taken with this book, yes it might compair is to 50 Shades but it is a amped up 50 Shades. Both characters are flawed but the chemistry between them made me want to take a shower!!!!!!<br /><br />I cant wait for the next book to come out - the ending just stoped so I am in limbo!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album absolutely blows away Snakes and Arrows. Not only do you have a jamming Rush but the melodic as well!! The song Headlong Fight is definitly the best song on the album. Probably one of the best songs that they put out in a while. The melodic side is back. The songs Halo Effect, The Wreckers and The Garden have an atmospheric sound that will send chills through you as you listen. There is not a bad song on the album, compared to finding a good song that will stick to you on Snakes and Arrows. They have come along way with their music. and hopefully they will make more! This CD gives me faith in the bands new music form again. I hope it continues. You can only Wish Them Well! See you at the show in Philly!
B002ZFQD04|4.0|Is a great concert and great show, cd is a great compilation of the most notorious songs during the concert (although that I dont really like all of them and some get skip out) is a great cd for listen and even exercise. The only inconvenience is that some The Sticky & Sweet Tour CD/DVD cames determine with the region that the dvd can be watch, so this situation was not describe on the item and i was unable to watch it but seller and customer resolutions with Amazon was incredible, thank you for the great wexperience and mistakes can make, dont judge.
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly changed our lives. Other than my wife's hypertension, we thought we were doing well. The blood pressure is down, we both took off weight, feel great, have energy all day - it goes on and on. I urge you to read through the whole book. Some people just want to lose weight, so they look for the plan. But Dr. Davis explains the problems with wheat and it is very interesting all the way through. Couldn't put it down. We're 5 weeks along now and amazed at the difference in our health and feeling of well being.<br /><br />We were concerned the menu change would be radical and difficult. How wrong we were. It is the simplest of diets. Eliminate wheat products - that's it! You can go further by limiting sugars and starches, and eliminating all processed foods, but we had already done that to some extent.<br /><br />The reason it is so easy is because food cravings are gone - we're no longer hungry two hours after eating. I can go all day just on breakfast if I need to. And our taste buds have come alive - natural food tastes awesome! Some garden foods are like candy now.<br /><br />What he says about gluten free foods you buy is also very interesting.<br /><br />Happy health!
B007MDB548|5.0|Wonderful addition to the rest! Don't hesitate too purchase if you own the others. Tastefully done entertainment for adults and children. I find myself watching it every time my 4yr old daughter plays this DVD lol enjoy
1612680011|5.0|I had heard so many good things about this book/author, but I almost didn't buy it because of a few negative reviews on here.  However, I ended up taking a chance and buying it anyway.  Boy am I glad I did.  This was a really good book which, for me, was very motivational and really reinforced the financial fundamentals.  I can definitely recommend this book.
1469984202|5.0|If it has a few imperfections, it is nonetheless one of the most innovative, creative stories I've read in years. The plot busts along at a crazy pace. The characters are complex and credible. And the ideas build beautifully, surprising you with their novelty and power. Is it fair to say I loved these stories? Absolutely. It's the first book in a long time to keep me reading through the night.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|When I first heard about this book, there was alot of controversy surrounding it. But Ive never been swayed by other peoples perceptions so I bought the book. I read it in 3 days, thats how it gripped me. The way this book is written, I have to wonder what kind of research the author had to do...<br />What appealed to me most in this book was the fact that Christian and Anastasia came for two totally different worlds, how they worked together and made compromises.<br />There were quite a few moments in the book that had me hot and bothered, and a few that had me horrified, but the way this book ended, just had me crying (needless to say I immediately bought Fifty Shades Darker).<br />I loved this book and am so glad that I didn't listen to the hype!
0062060562|3.0|The story: woman has amnesia, every day wakes up not knowing who or where she is, mystery begins .I've given her 3 stars because I liked the begining of the book.  Then the story seem to be endlessly repeating itself..I began to jump pages  at a time.  However, that last section at Brighton was ridiculous.  The ending was silly with the appearance  of characters never before in the story The language sounded pure USA and I often thought the book was set in NY. NNever could quite figure out if they were in London or the suburbs.  Further, with a computer close at hand O would think she could do a bit of self discovery.<br /><br />As far as the story  A good idea for a plot however the writing was  fair.  I must admit it was a page turner for about 100 pages.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|I think it's actually a pretty good Pumpkins album and is the best release since Adore (if you even considered that to be a good release at the time compared to their older material). It's certainly a far cry from the cookie cutter releases over the past 10 years. But hey, I'm also a Gish, Siamese Dream, Pisces Iscariot, Mellon Collie, and Aeroplane Flies High fan.  \\"Drown\\" The 'full' 8 minute version found on the \\"Singles\\" soundtrack, was also a great song which really would have been great had they included this on Siamese Dream.  Instead it was released on the Greatest Hits and is an edited down version of the song.  I think too many people whom review the Pumpkins' work, focus and compare everything too much to Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness.  Though that is/was a great album, I personally don't believe it was still as good as their official first three (one being a b-sides album) releases.<br /><br />All that said on Pumpkins' nostalgia, let me get to my review of Oceania.  I have read many reviews about the production of the album concerning the drums sounding like they were done on a drum machine. I agree with this to an extent. I think more of a mastering technique could have been used on the low end, and that too much emphasis was put on Corgan's voice on certain tracks. Guitars sound good, clarity is good, but loudness on parts that it should have been used (bass, drums) could have been a little better. I found when listening to it out of the four times I have (twice at home, once in my car, once on my ipod touch), that the bigger the speakers are or having a good quality sub-woofer -or both paired, the better the sound is. You can't be afraid to turn it up either. I synched it to my ipod and played it through my earbuds and compared to past Pumpkins albums I thought the bass was pretty flat or just barely there throughout most of the album with the exception of the song \\"Pale Horse.\\" So again, try to put use to a good stereo system and I don't thinkyou'll be disappointed. Really, the only song I could do without (and did not sync to my ipod or burn to a CD for my car) was \\"One Diamond, One Heart\\" -I just don't think it fits with everything else here due to too much synth and electronic sound. Upon my 1st listen, \\"Pinwheels\\" also began to scare me at the beginning of the song for the 1st few minutes until the guitar kicked in a few minutes through. Wildflower also didn't do much for me either.  I really think they had the potential to close out this album with a song or two better than that, and so that and the reasons listed above is why I give Oceania a four-star rating.  Other than that I think it's overall a pretty solid. I give it a 4/5, but I still say give it a listen then judge. The more you play it, the better it sounds and the more you can appreciate it. I think the problem with any new album by any artist anymore is that we keep expecting the same sound as what we grew up on and many Artist's as they too get older, are simply refining their sound. They want a good album, not something slopped out purely for Alternative rock radio.  As much as I even hate to say it, I think if this is what you're doing when it comes to the older Alternative artists/bands, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment as it's likely we're never going to hear the same sound again.  On yet another level of Alternative; Radiohead is another great example of a band who has done this with hits and misses over the years.  I'm sure many of us could think of many more examples.

B00361CAEE|3.0|Vogue is a fashion magazine. Anna Wintour is the editor-in-chief. She seems to call the shots, vetoing other people's inputs. She's not nice but doesn't have to be because she is the top dog. But all in all, what's the point? Fashion can be fun, some of the magazine pictures are beautiful and silly, but this designer wear costs thousands of dollars that most of us can't afford to buy. Sure, I browse through Vogue sometimes, but I never lose sight of the fact that fashion is just clothing.<br /><br />It's kind of strange to see that these are the tastemakers because I don't necessarily think they have the best eye or taste, and fashion is supposed to be subjective.<br /><br />I'm not sure I learned anything from this documentary. I enjoy beautiful textures, fabrics, and looking at nice clothing but it's almost like the fashion world is a bubble.<br /><br />My favorite person in the documentary was Grace Coddington, she just seemed more down-to-earth, relatable, and approachable.
0375869026|5.0|-----------------------------------------<br />\\"Wonder\\"<br />By R. J. Palacio<br />(Knopf, 2012)<br />-----------------------------------------<br />This is a deeply compelling page-turner about a ten-year old boy named August (\\"Auggie\\") Pullman who is a sweet, compelling narrator, but whose external life is marred by the intense negative reactions that strangers have when they see his face: Auggie was born the victim of multiple genetic disorders which combined and intertwined to malform his face from birth onwards. The book opens with his decision to enroll in a regular school after years of homeschooling -- he's going straight into junior high, with all its petty cruelties and emotional upheavals. The story is told from Auggie's point of view, as well as other characters such as his sister and various kids at his school. The countless humiliations and slights, intentional or otherwise, that bound Auggie's life are balanced by the depth of his character and that of the people around him...<br /><br />Many readers, including parents of disabled children, and the children themselves, as well as students and educators, will find a lot to celebrate here. The subtlety, nuance and humanity of this book is tremendous; it is a story packed with humor, insight, moral power and a strong, healthy dose of pure empathy and human kindness. If you saw Auggie walking on the street, chances are you might look away -- as do many in this book -- but after reading this story, you'll wish you could spend more time with him. I know I did. Great story, highly recommended. (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's book reviews)
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Good fast pace movie.  Really good and has a little bit of everything.  It's mystical, it has the mob, drugs, fantasy, lots of twists.  Very interesting and really opens up your thinging to what if?  I loved it and you will too. When he takes the drug you are in for a surprise, the screen does an interesting thing. Loved the Blue Ray although I didn't notice it until he took the drug and then WOW!  Hold on it's quite a ride.
B005Y1SVKQ|4.0|This app is great, now I have pics with measurements to show when I'm at Lowes or Home Depot trying to explain what I'm looking for.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed the fifty shades trilogy! I was a bit disappointed with the ending for the first book but decided to purchase the second and i am glad i did. They were nicely written and i highly recommend!
B000N2HCM4|5.0|I bought this book to learn more about what makes this man \\"tick\\"...I have not been disappointed.  He is very candid in this book; and certainly struggles with who he is - and is very concerned with his race and being a black man.  He makes it clear that he does not like \\"white folks\\"; and that he leans to the teachings of Malcolm X and Islam.  It shows me that he is definitely not the man I want to see guide this country for the next 4 years.  I am glad I have read this book written by him, showing me exactly what he thinks; and how racist he truly is.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is not for children or adults who are easily offended. Explicit descriptions are overdone in my opinion Not for prudes.
B007MAETA8|1.0|I was so excited when I saw John Mayer had a new CD for sale I couldn't wait to listen to it. What a disappointment! He shouldn't have bothered with this one. I wasted my money and now have a different point of view as to his musical talents. I know he can do much, much better because I have his Room For Squares, Heavier Things, Continuum, Battle Studies, Inside Wants Out and a couple of his DVD concerts. What was he thinking when he released this one????<br />I would not recommend this CD to anyone you'll be left out in the cold........
0393061310|2.0|The conditions in which a civilization develops determines if the civilization will be conquered by other civilization.  Seeing the world through Prof Diamond's lens, enables the reader to see that the outcome of conflict is amoral - you shouldn't view the victor as a superior race.  Prof's Diamond presents an agruement that enviromental advantages, beginning with domestication of crops and animals, led to the Europeans colonizing the world.  Farming allows for higher population densities - resulting a civilization resistant to disease with structured government and written language.  These innovations are requirements for advanced technology including steel and guns.<br /><br />That is a short overview.  The wikipedia summary is quite good too.<br /><br />The problem, the reason Guns, Germs, and Steel is almost unreadable, is Prof. Diamond goes too wide - he explains everything in minute detail.  He expects none of his arguments to be taken at face value.  Maybe theories on the global human migration or how domestication changes plants and animals were more controversial in 1998 when the book was first release, but today the defense seems tedious.  If you are a scholarly reader, dig in.  If you are a causal reader, look else where.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very fun game play it all the time. it is worth getting. I would recommend it for everyone.the best app
B007T2XC7A|1.0|I'm very disappointed with Little Broken Hearts. I love Norah's first album, she has a beautiful voice for soulful jazz. Her latest venture seems to be an attempt to break into the soulless pop market and is worse than her previous album's attempt at country.
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is very fun and i was excited when the kindle fire was able to get this app but it can get very boring at times wat i wonder is does the game ever stop?
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Wolfram Alpha is a tremendous application for students and instructors.  The visualization of the problem is a great way to learn and teach.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this app is really fun I play it when I can my dad has a kindle too and I showed him my city and he started and. is addicted to like me.
030758836X|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Gone Girl is one of the most fascinating portraits of a psychopath that I have ever read. Amy Dunne discovers that her husband Nick Dunne is cheating and instead of divorcing him or having it out with him about the affair, she stages her own death so that Nick looks like the guilty party (but you don't know that until like half-way through the book). This is not her first rodeo either. Though she has never committed a crime to this scale before, she has a history of accusing people of rape/stalking when they piss her off.<br /><br />The story alternates between Nick's POV in the present and Amy's POV from her diary for the first part of the book. In the beginning, you love Amy. She's the victim. Nick has been emotionally distant and physically abusive. Plus, she seems naive and I can't help but feel sorry for her. Plus, Nick is a total dick in his chapters. He's too stoic and unlikeable, but he's also insecure (because of the emotional abuse he suffered as a child) and has bursts of love for his wife,  so you kind of feel bad for him too.<br /><br />Even after I knew beyond all doubt that Amy staged the whole thing and fabricated the Amy from the first part of the book, I still wanted her to live happily ever after and for Nick to go to jail. She manipulated ME so much in the first part of the book that even in the last bit, I was still rooting for her. That's insane. High-five Gillian Flynn. You're the man (I mean that in as non-sexist a way as possible)!<br /><br />This book was not only compelling plot-wise, but made some astute observations about married life and how two people can truly be in a addicted to each other in a toxic relationship. Also about women in society in general: how they often assume a personality only to attract men re: The Cool Girl. Gone Girl (at least from Amy's perspective) seems to suggest that the only way to be subversive as a woman in this world is through going after what you want, even if it means manipulating people, committing felonies, and ruining reputations.<br /><br />This book is technically a mystery/thriller and I don't usually read those kinds of novels. However, this book is about so much more. There isn't a ton of crappy police drama (I got Law and Order for that), which was nice. There was a lot of publicity/journalism stuff that I was like, ok, this is a little over the top. But all in all it was freaking amazing! Flynn is an incredible writer and deep, calculated thinker. If you want a book that will seriously mess with your head, this is it. Happy summer reading!
B0086700CM|5.0|So glad kindle finally got this app!! I cant stop playing the game. Its, well, addicting! Not much else to be said.
0345803485|1.0|REPETITIVE, POORLY WRITTEN TRASH. I NOW FEEL 50 SHADES DUMBER AFTER READING THIS BOOK, IT LITERALLY GAVE ME A HEADACHE.

B007KQ6XYY|3.0|it preety much like the first one it was ok but not the best. its not the best app in the world
B0050DIWFC|5.0|My daughter recommended this novel by Landay and said \\"Dad, you have to read this and tell me what YOU would do under the circumstances.\\"  My daughter is 45 years old with three boys like Jacob...in fact the oldest is named Jacob.  As the story unfolds you continue to ask yourself \\"What would I do?\\"  My other daughter is a forensic scientist with 13 years experience in DNA work.  She says there is no basis for what Landay develops as a possible \\"murder gene\\" but he makes me wonder.  Landay is very good at character development and describing what REALLY happens in family crises and in dealing with a teenage boy.  It is real and if you are a parent of a teenage boy, you will LOVE this book.  I have six children.  I just read Landay's first book \\"Mission Flats\\" and it rivals \\"Defending Jacob\\" but more focused on police work in Boston.  Kudos to William Landay.
B0086700CM|5.0|Glad they finally have this game for kindle fire! I play it literally every day. Everyone should get this game(:
B006N9KFPC|5.0|This album is phenomenal .. i love his voice!! .. pop songs and slower really beautiful songs as well <3
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it and its super addicting.  who knew getting chased by a monkey could be so fun???!!! once I got it I couldn't stop playing I loved it woo much.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I liked \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" so I read \\"World Without End\\" which I liked a bit less.  I started to feel uncomfortable with the constant depiction of the Catholic Church as a bunch of cynics, corrupt or idiots (or all three combined), and with the idea that all noblemen are bastards while ALL poor people are exploited. But I dismissed this feeling telling myself that I was probably being paranoid.  Then I read \\"A place called Freedom\\" and I am finishing the \\"Fall of Giants\\". They are mostly pieces of propaganda.<br />It is interesting to see that lefties such as Ken Follet need to distort completely the past to make it fit their twisted hateful and envious view of the world.<br />Fall of Giants has many interesting facts and descriptions, but is mostly \\"history as the left would like that it had happened\\" to promote Marxist class warfare.<br />The bolcheviques are mostly sympathetic figures with no hint of the millions of people that they killed a few years later while trying to impose their tyranny.  Imagine for a second that the same sympathetic portrait was done about a Nazi... Wouldn't be howls of horror everywhere (fully justified, BTW)?<br />Well.... That's exactly the way I feel. You don't \\"humanize\\" murderers.  Called them communists or Nazis.<br />This book is crap.
B0086700CM|5.0|if u love fun games then this is the game for u and u will not ever get bord of this game its just to fun!!!!!!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|The update to version 3 has ruined this. Visually =uglier. Functionality and accuracy = reduced. And the worst part? Crappy, imitation swype actions for things like punctuation, etc. that ruin the user experience.  If I wanted swype I'd install it. Not happy. Even worse, no way to uninstall the update. :-(
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Great game. Not too easy, but not too hard either. Only wish it had more info on how gain points. Great for killing time though.

0345803485|5.0|love love this book! truly a great read from start to finish! love how you feel like the fly on the wall in the whole story, sometimes knowing a little too much of these characters! but so enlightened about some new areas in their personal lives! awesome! highly recommend!!
1469984202|5.0|Wow. Just finished Hugh Howey's magnum opus, the Wool Omnibus. It's quite the ride.<br /><br />Wool is a mind-blowing, page-turning adventure that'll have you scratching at your head and thinking, how the hell did Hugh come up with this awesomeness?<br /><br />The inhabitants of Wool live in a dystopian future. The world outside is a brutal place, swept by toxic sandstorms and full of unbreathable air. The people of the world are forced to live in \\"silos,\\" long canister-like living quarters drilled miles into the ground. Many silo inhabitants suffer from \\"out\\" sickness--they feel that the \\"Wool\\" has been pulled over their eyes by the silo owners, and that the world outside is perfectly breathable and livable, that all the images on the outside viewscreens are computer-generated illusions. Anyone who says they want \\"out\\" is granted their wish. Though it's not a wish that anyone should want...<br /><br />Twists and turns abound in Howey's omnibus. The Wool #1 will have you on the edge of your seat routing for the sheriff. By the time Wool #5 comes around, you'll still be on edge, this time routing for a completely different character, and wondering how she's going to get out of the tight situations that Hugh places her in.<br /><br />This is wonderful, engaging stuff. I can easily understand why Ridley Scott would auction this puppy... the writing is cinematic, and invokes all five senses.<br /><br />I'm glad Hugh was able to snag a spot in the top 10 on Amazon's Science-Fiction 'anthologies' section... because it will only bring him more readers, and in turn fund more Wool stories. I can see this as being a seminal, defining work in the genre.<br /><br />Pick this up any day of the week when you're ready to read up a windstorm!
0345803493|5.0|I was so excited to read this book! I have been talking about it non stop with my co workers! We all discuss who would be the best mr. grey in real life! so enchanting!! gread read.. much better then the first one!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this trilogy down!!! It's not porn, it's an amazing story of two people's lives crossing paths and intertwining in such a captivating way that you are heartbroken that it's only a trilogy. It's a MUST read!!!
0062060562|1.0|After page 100 I wanted to smother Christine with a pillow.  She just wasn't a likable main character. I wonder how much they had to pay Lehane for his 'Memento on crystal meth' quote. That's why I bought this never ending dragged out novel.  I love Lehane, I love Memento so this should be a no brainer, right?  I tried really hard to enjoy this novel but after the tenth time of her waking up and doing the same thing over and over and over again... it totally lost me.  The ending can also be seen from a mile away.  Dont believe the hype.
B0088TG252|4.0|Despite a few negative reviews here I enjoyed this movie. It takes some interesting twists and turns in unexpected places. The basic story is a old one (Spy vs Spy) but is action packed and very watchable from start to finish. Very much worth the $3.99 rental price for an evenings entertainment. I will not go into any specifics in this review to avoid being a spoiler. If you like spy flics \\"try it, you will like it\\".
1451627289|5.0|This was my first Stephen King novel that I read and it blew me away.  I fell in love with the story, the characters and the ending was one of my favorites of all time.  Since reading 11/22/63 I have gone on to read more King novels including Under the Dome and The Stand and I have to say that I am becoming a very big King fan.  I can't wait to see what he does next.
030771652X|4.0|This was a book club pick so I wasn't sure what to expect. Was VERY happily surprised that it lived up to prior reviews. I connected with the main character Bee right away through the description of her relationship with her sister. I have a similar one with my brother. But what really hooked me was the believable disintegration of Bee's former life and how it was described as she sinks deeper into trying to solve the mystery of her sister's murder - which initially only she believes is a murder and not a suicide. Made me really think and wonder about what I would do. Bee, her sister and her mother are well fleshed out characters with whom an emotional connection can be made. The other characters are less defined on purpose but still well-formed in their personalities and behaviors except the murderer. I was surprised we didn't get a better sense of who they are and their motives.
0307959856|3.0|..in the disposal in marriage of four of their five daughters.'<br /><br />This novel is set in 1803, some years after `Pride and Prejudice' was written, but before publication.  It's `Pride and Prejudice' revisited and expanded with hints of `Emma' and `Persuasion', and an overlay of murder.  Elizabeth Bennet has married Fitzwilliam Darcy, and is now the mistress of Pemberley.  The couple has two sons - Fitzwilliam (nearly 5) and Charles (just 2)<br />It is the eve of the annual Lady Anne's ball when the tranquillity of the Darcys is shattered.  An unexpected carriage careers up the driveway, containing Elizabeth's sister Lydia (the one who eloped with George Wickham) screaming that her husband is dead.  A search party is despatched, and finds George Wickham in the woods, drunk, dishevelled, and bloodstained, beside the body of his friend Captain Denny.  It looks a lot like George Wickham has murdered Captain Denny (he even admits that it's his fault).  But is it?  And what's the truth about the mysterious woman seen prowling around the Pemberley woods?<br /><br />As the obvious suspect, Wickham is hauled off to gaol.  Yet Darcy considers him innocent, despite the fact that he has nothing but contempt for Wickkham.  After all, Wickham had tried to seduce Darcy's 15 year old sister to try to get her fortune.  Elizabeth has her own uncomfortable recollections: she once found Wickham attractive and had temporarily detested Darcy as a consequence.<br /><br />I'm happy enough to think the worst of George Wickham, and quite enjoyed the various twists in solving the murder case.  I liked the portrait of Pemberley and the relative happiness that Elizabeth has achieved, despite the onerous responsibilities associated with running the Pemberley household and her social obligations.  I liked, too, the way in which Ms James recreates a version of Jane Austen's early 19th world.  But for me, this novel is not a particularly satisfying Austen sequel.  And, because of the constraints imposed by the Austen characters and setting, it isn't as effective as a piece of crime fiction as it otherwise might be.<br /><br />`I have never approved of protracted dying. It is an affectation in the aristocracy; in the lower classes it is merely an excuse for avoiding work.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smithints imposed by the Austen characters and setting, it isn't as effective as a piece of crime fiction as it otherwise might be.<br /><br />`I have never approved of protracted dying.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Even better than the  first one. I just wish the corrective prediction was a little more 'predictive'. The halo themwbis nice.  Even on SGII.  Recommend  highly.
B00881VLCE|5.0|fun and innovative app that has visually appealing puzzles ranging fro.m simple to challenging that is sure to have you captivated for hours.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Where to go from here!!<br />That is a good question, I don't think there is anything out there that will hold my interest like this Trilogy!!  I could not put it down, every spare minute I had was spent holding my Kindle!! I do hope E.L. James will bring on another one as captivating as this one!!! Loved it!!!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This movie was seemed contrived from the start. I do not watch many movies and I am sorry I wasted my time on this one.
B007SGM084|5.0|The Trilogy was just great!!!  Could not put it down!!! Where to go from here??? One of my best friends was reading with me so we could discuss!! That made it even more enjoyable and fun!!  I must admit, I was sad to see it end!!! I do hope E.L. James will write more books as exciting as these were!!
0375703764|4.0|This book made me shiver when I read it. If you would like to see if it is possible for a mere book to produce feelings of dread, and even horror, I suggest you begin your experiment here.<br /><br />Materials :<br />1.<br />10 or 20 small candles, maybe \\"tealight\\" style candles, from the dollar tree or superstore<br />2.<br />A small lighter<br />3.<br />A place alone with no artificial light, or just cover up those little blinking LEDs with napkins or something<br />4.<br />House of Leaves<br />5.<br />A mind altering drug, perhaps alcohol, if legally available.<br /><br />Procedure :<br />1.<br />Wait until the dead of night, when most people are asleep.<br />2.<br />Put the candles somewhere prominent near where you will be reading.<br />3.<br />Flex your imagination, and try to suspend disbelief as much as possible.<br />4.<br />Rip off the book jacket and front matter blank pages of the book House of Leaves.<br />5.<br />Take a shot of whiskey, or what have you.<br />6.<br />Read House of Leaves by candle light.<br /><br />My results? The exquisite dread and empty feeling I had while reading this lasted for days. Echoes of it still linger. It's an experience I will not soon forget. The only way it could have been weirder is if it had shown up on my doorstep in a blood-spotted plastic bag of unlabeled typewriter pages.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Throughout this book I was impressed with the ability of the writer to convey his story in a way that was both captivating and inspiring. Scott Jurek is no ordinary man, however his story reads as if anyone can achieve levels of greatness. The books style of ending each chapter with a recipe was very unique. I cant praise this book enough, it actually has the ability to make you feel upbeat and motivated as you read it.
0307352145|5.0|This is a book so fantastic that at times I have to put it down just to marvel at it.  I bought extra copies to give to other people that I thought would enjoy it.  If you're the kind of person that finds yourself talking with a small group of people at a party with a lot of people, buy this book.  If you go to a bar and you don't like the fact that it's super loud and crowded, buy this book.  Actually, just buy this book no matter who you are.  If you're an introvert, you'll love it, if not, you'll learn about a large chunk of the population.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|This was a very well researched and documented 'Cold Case\\" from pre WWII China. The story is both shocking and fascinating. I found it hard to put this book down. This book also gives color to this period in Chinese history from the perspective of an ex patriot. A very moving story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's a great time waster esp. for long car rides. My sister and I love it. The variety of games makes it hard to put down. :)
B007I1Q4W2|3.0|Some of the acting and dialogue could have been better, but for a low budget zombie flick, this is much better than I had anticipated.  The Civil War horrors meet a new kind of terror:  zombies!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I think this book was brilliantly written!  The way it went back and forth between the past and the present.  There was so much detail, it was definitely well researched.  I will be looking for more books by Elizabeth Haynes!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so amazing, I couldn't put it down, and I had to buy the other 2 as well! GREAT BOOKS!

B00785P2QC|4.0|You need to make it to where I can rotate the buildings when I try to build anything so it fits and you need to make it to where I can update the game when there's actually Internet since the game kept saying there wasn't a Internet connection when there actually was. other than this it's awesome the entire game is perfect.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is not just for the \\"younger\\" crowd.  I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  Haven't seen the movie yet!

B0047T86G0|1.0|[[ASIN:0199571120 Oxford Dictionary of English]]<br />I purchased the kindle version of this book and I am disappointed. I normally used on my daily routine a dictionary as consultation tool but when I tried version it is terrible; it takes too long to look for possible options of an entry and then it gives you multiple selections where the word has been used in any contest on the dictionary and if you are lucky the definition of you entry would be on the first twenty of so. I used to have a PDF version of this dictionary which was marvelous. Please do not loss your money in this product I GRADED CERO.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Fun, although challenging at times. My kids like it too (age 4 and 6). I love the 1 where you purposefully have to crush things!
0345803507|5.0|From the time I started the 1st book until the time I finished the 3rd book was about 12 days.  This was a wonderful way to end the series.  Only thing better would be if it didn't have to end!  2nd and 3rd books are better than the 1st book so keep reading.  Books 2 & 3 have more plot and Christian becomes more likeable.  I really think I'd read them again and again through my life.  At the end of this book, you get to read the first chapter or two of the first book from Christian's point of view and I thought that was so clever and super fun to read.  Now, I'd love to hear more from Christian (hint, hint EL James)!  My husband also enjoyed my reading these books (if you know what I mean)! ;)

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had to read it because it's all everyone was talking about.  Didn't do a ton of research on the front end, so didn't really know what it was all about.  Man! I had no clue they were this erotic!  I'm not complaining about it, it was intreguing...somewhat of a guilty pleasure.  I'm not sure I could go around recommending them (verbally) to everyone I know, especially at work and the like, for fear I'd be judged for enjoying them!  But I did enjoy them.  They are just a little too riskay, for the workplace.  From the time I started the 1st until I finished the 3rd book was 12 days and that's with a full time job and 2 babies. The first book was good, not the most amazing book I've ever read, but good.  And the way it ends left me at a place where I just had to know what happens next.  Within minutes of finishing book 1, I started on book 2.  The 2nd and 3rd books are better than the first.  Probably the 2nd is my favorite.  All and all I enjoyed them all and definitley couldn't put them down.  I think I'll read them again from time to time.  My husband really enjoyed my reading them, too (if you know what I mean)! ;)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app been using since it came out but I know for sure it's been updated but just not on Amazon... Is this going to be an issue with all the apps I get from amazon?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'll start by saying, I much enjoyed the Fifty Shades Trilogy and read them all with in 12 days.<br />As far as the story line, the series gets better with books 2 and 3.  Christian certainly becomes more likeable.  I wanted to punch him through most of the 1st book.  The writing doesn't get much better and the author still uses the same phrases a bit (or way) too much.  Would be fun to play a drinking game where you drink every time she writes \\"he regards me shrewdly\\" or \\"I blush/flush crimson\\" or \\"he presses his lips into a firm line\\", etc.  I think it's the oddity of these sayings (no one in real life says these things) that makes them stick out even more, so the over use is really aparant.  If she just wrote \\"I blush\\" 100 times in the book, then it wouldn't stand out so much.  These and many others are constants throughout all 3 books.  You won't read them then say \\"that's the most well written books I've ever read\\" but that's not all that important to me (kinda irritated my husband though).  If you can get past these things, I really found it all very intriguing and I couldn't put the books down.  My husband enjoyed my reading them too (if you know what I mean).

B0013K1ALE|3.0|Pretension runs all through director Peter Clifton's 137 minute long, 1976 quasi-documentary on Led Zeppelin and a series of three concert performances at Madison Square Garden, in New York City, during July of 1973, called The Song Remains The Same. Aside from the concert footage, the film weaves assorted silly fantasy sections into the film, as well as footage of backstage goings on, such as security guards beating rowdy fans, the theft of $203,000 from the band's safe deposit box at the hotel they were staying at, and band manager Peter Grant's bullying of various Garden personnel over matters trivial and not, among others. The film was not the first attempt at a true `rockumentary,' but it was the first rockumentary to try and add extraneous fictive material so the whole could be seen as a work of art, apart and above the actual music. Prior to The Song Remains The Same such films, like Michael Wadleigh's 1970 documentary Woodstock, on the famed 1969 rock festival, were basically strictly journalistic endeavors or attempts at cinema verit&egrave;. Not so with this film. And that's its fatal flaw.<br /><br />  While the music, and even the band's lapses into self-indulgence, are great, the film's cinematic pretensions bring the whole effort down into a barely passable cinematic mediocrity. In a sense, parts of the film play out almost like a precursor to Rob Reiner's seminal 1984 `mockumentary' classic This Is Spinal Tap. Numerous shots where the band is actually `live' in concert are mixed in with scenes of them on stages at Shepperton Studios that do not resemble their American venues, and numerous other little alterations had to be made. The film would have been so much better had they simply filmed the concerts, then did the fantasy sequences and combined them, rather than the time and money wasting rigmarole that ensued.<br /><br />  Unlike the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night, which received overwhelmingly positive reviews for a bad film, The Song Remains The Same, a merely mediocre film, was almost routinely savagely attacked from Day One, mainly for the fantasy sequences. That said, like the Beatles film, the Led Zeppelin film did well at the box office. Unlike A Hard Day's Night, though, The Song Remains The Same was, indeed, a highly influential film. Almost all concert films and rockumentaries that have come since have this film's DNA stamped on it, for the good or the ill. And, unlike the Beatles film, this film's improvs are restricted to the musical stage, where Plant and Page were masters of that art form.merely mediocre film, was almost routinely savagely attacked from Day One, mainly for the fantasy sequences.

B0010X8NF0|2.0|The Darjeeling Limited is not a bad film, and nowhere near one of the all time worst films. But, in no way, shape, nor form, can anyone who understands and appreciates the art of cinema call this a good, much less great film, and those who have praised it or claimed it was one of the best films of its year are idiots, pure and simple. It is, in a sense, the sine qua non of mediocrity, and Anderson is the same thing in the realm of directors, which only begs the question as to what The Criterion Collection finds so valuable about his cinematic canon. More than that, I get the real sense, given Anderson's comments on the audio commentary track, and in the extra features, that he is not even trying to grow and make films of substance and quality any longer. And this is a shame, because Rushmore, the first film of his to break big, was a good film, and one which showed potential for Anderson to become a valuable asset for American cinema. In fact, only David Gordon Green's debut film, George Washington, showed more potential for a young American filmmaker, in the last dozen years, yet he too has stagnated, although his problem is more based in mere selling out to Hollywood and its conventions, whereas Anderson seems to be just creatively dead. Given his working and personal relationship with Roman Coppola- who's proven he's a good screenwriter, it would seem that Coppola would be the person to turn to for his next film's screenplay; to get outside of Andersonworld. If not, he may be doomed to becoming his generation's Tim Burton; a thought even scarier than any of that perpetual juvenile's own films.

B0064NTZKI|3.0|I watched the recent PBS American Masters documentary on Woody Allen, Woody Allen: A Documentary, online, and it was surely a disappointment. It covered, in its three and a half hours, many of his films, his early life and break into show business, but it offered almost nothing of depth- oddly recapitulating the flaws of Barbara Kopple's 1998 documentary on the same subject, Wild Man Blues. In a sense, the film gives the best representation of the critical cribbing that is killing most film criticism, by having vapid and flat out bad critics opine on subjects they do not understand, but it does little to give one a better understanding of the filmmaker, for the so-called talking head 'experts' it relies on are the dense and pretentious film professor Annette Insdorf, the lifeless hack film critic Richard Schickel, the ebulliently vacuous film critic Leonard Maltin, a film critic priest named Robert Lauder, who utters...well, nothing of value about Hannah And Her Sisters, a number of Allen's co-stars and actors, who burble on cluelessly, and, worst of all, utterly unknown schlock filmmaker and critic, F.X. Feeney, who displays he has absolutely no clue about films, in general, much less Allen's, in particular. The much better insights into Allen's life and art come from his non-screen cohorts: comic and talk show host Dick Cavett, managers Jack Rollins and Charles Joffe, cinematographer Gordon Willis, and co-writers Mickey Rose and Marshall Brickman. The only other filmmaker of note to appear on screen is Martin Scorsese and he mostly rambles on about how his New York and Allen's are like visions from two different worlds. Well, duh, Marty. Exactly how and why is that is never broached by Weide.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there are worse ways to spend 210 minutes. The problem is, there are almost as many ways to better spend such time. I recommend the latter option, especially with the knowledge that most Allen films are crisp enough that almost three full features of his can be squeezed into that same timeframe. My recommendation? Try Stardust Memories, Another Woman, Crimes And Misdemeanors, and, for dessert, Allen's truly greatest comedy: Radio Days. You can thank me later.is can be squeezed into that same timeframe.

B001CN2WXM|5.0|L.A. Confidential is a great film not because it is revolutionary, in terms of style nor approach, but because it is so uniformly excellent in every area. It is one of those films that stands in counterpoint to the director as auteur, although surely a different director would have made a different film. The point is that the material is so good that it's one of those can't miss films. It also exemplifies that the most revolutionary thing in art is greatness, especially sustained greatness. Any work of art, and any artist, has to be judged in this manner, since it is the only objective way to evaluate things. Notions like revolutionary or daring are too subjective. What was revolutionary often becomes clich&eacute;d. True originality resists easy mimicry and subsequent triteness.<br /><br />  A good example of this comes from two earlier films that this one is most compared to: Roman Polanski's Chinatown (1974), and Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994). While both of these are good films, neither is great. Chinatown is far less complex than L.A. Confidential, and almost wholly dependent upon lead actor Jack Nicholson's abilities. Quick- other than John Huston, name me an actor from that film. See? It's also a far less realistic film, and far more dependent upon style. Even more style-dependent is Pulp Fiction, a film almost devoid of realism. In fact, even though it is based on a novel, whereas Serpico was based upon real life events across the continent, and two decades later, L.A. Confidential is really an extension of that Al Pacino film's exploration of evil. Both show that all the cops are criminals of one sort or another. Only degree of criminality is in question. In both films, the leads win, but pay for victory with extreme loss. This is why Curtis Hanson's film is better than the two films it's most compared to by critics, and holds up well against the more realistic drama of Serpico. It's also why, compared to the violence, especially in Pulp Fiction, that in this film is never gratuitous. It always is at a minimum, within the bounds of character and circumstance, and advances the story, even if just in a small way. Also, the fact that all the cops, even the `good ones,' are criminals, is something just not seen in most films of the last few decades of Right Wing hagiography of all who wear uniforms.<br /><br />  When this film came out, in 1997, it was one of the few films that I ever saw twice in a theater. After having seen it once with a female friend, I recommended it to other friends, and went to see it again with them. In watching it a couple of times over the years, and for review, it is one of those films that has many things in its backgrounds, many moments that become `Aha' moments upon rewatch, and make the viewer re-evaluate just what the film is doing and why. This is the definition of depth. Yes, the film is not as existential as Ingmar Bergman's Shame, nor is it as innovative as Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, nor does it present reality as closely and achingly as Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story, but its uniform excellence, and ability to do even its genre moments well (I recall pumping my fist and going, `yeah!\\" when Exley shoots Smith in the back at my first viewing), and recast clich&eacute;s as something different (bright lights noir), are among the many reasons this film rises to greatness. I would not go so far as the hagiographizing Andrew Sarris, in casting all crime films as pre- and post-L.A. Confidential, because the film does as much to celebrate film noir as it does to recast it, but it certainly is one of the best Hollywood films of the last thirty years or so. It is also the high point of director Curtis Hanson's rather pedestrian career, and the only one of his films to ever come near and surpass greatness, another argument that auteurism is not the only way to get a great work of cinema made for, without the contributions of those mentioned, this film would likely still have been a good one,but great? I doubt it. Regardless, L.A. Confidential is a great film, one of the best crime drams ever filmed. See it. Or else.I doubt it. Regardless, L.A.

B000EHSVS2|4.0|Director Franklin Schaffner's 1970 film, Patton, is a film that falls just shy of overall greatness, unlike his previous film, Planet Of The Apes, even though both had excellent scripts, were unconventionally shot, had great acting performances, and were films that fundamentally altered their subgenres, biopics and science fiction. It is a film that, while it's clearly not a great film, does not offer up an obvious reason. It starts off brilliantly, with Patton's famous address to the film audience, and then, well, becomes, in many ways, a routine biopic- at least when it's not about Patton directly, for George C. Scott owns the screen like few actors ever before him had. No, it's when we see other characters, or the big battle scenes, that the film becomes pedestrian. And that 20% or so of pedestrian film lowers the rest of the film's inarguable greatness to merely near-great status.<br /><br />  Patton is not a great film, but in its flaws it delineates much of what a great film can be, and just how little of that needs to stem from the idea of a visionary or an auteur. As such, and along with Casablanca, it stands as one of the great arguments against the notion that films of quality must be wrought from the power and inspiration of a singular source. Franklin Schaffner, in fact, is proof that great art can come from people who are not gifted with innate greatness, just as the real General George S. Patton proved the opposite can also be true, and the two ideas not mutually opposing. As for the film, watch it for Scott's performance, watch it for a sense of American history (pro and con), and watch it because it's great entertainment, if not great art. Not all art need core into one's soul, sometimes pricking the flesh is enough. As such, Patton's a great prick.

B004U7MQXS|3.0|It was many years ago that I first saw the Beatles' 1964 debut black and white film, A Hard Day's Night, on PBS. It had to have been during the 1980s, possibly during a pledge drive. Given that I was not a Beatles fan growing up, I didn't think much of the film, however, perhaps this was my bias, the wan rift of memory, plus the fact that I have become a much more acute critic of all things, including cinema, clouding my memory. Then, a couple of years ago I watched the band's second film Help! It, too, was not a good film. In fact, it was quite a bad film. However, most critics state that the second film was not as good as the first, and this includes Roger Ebert and virtually every other online critic for, according to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 100% rating in terms of favorability.<br /><br />  Yet, the truth is, if Help! is, as I describe it, a `bad' film, its 87 minute long predecessor is a flat out terrible film. That anyone would find this appallingly poorly executed, unfunny, hodgepodge of ill acted swill remotely entertaining is a testament to the depths human enjoyment can plunge. Yes, the songs from the bands' early era are good, but there isn't a single joke told in this film that garners even a mild teehee. That some critics suggest this film is equal to the great classic comedies of the Marx Brothers shows how addled some minds truly are. While it's true that, as Ebert suggests, this film had a profound influence on the music video industry that arose in the 1980s, it's had a negligible impact on film, itself. Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, and Ingmar Bergman, among others, were already far more visually sophisticated and daring than anything director Richard Lester tossed into this film, along with cinematographer Gilbert Taylor. In fact, despite Ebert's claims that the film is `strikingly original,' the very opposite is true- it is derivative to the core (think Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, the Marx Brothers, the Ritz Brothers, the Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, the Bowery Boys- need I continue?); so, unless one wants to claim that being almost wholly and shamelessly derivative is perversely a `strikingly original' thing to be, Ebert's statement is doomed to go down as one of the greatest examples of his tendency to cinematically brain fart. The screenplay, by Alun Owen, is simply abominable. The film consists solely of songs with a few poor comic tidbits in between. These tidbits consist of the boys running away from female fans, engaging in pseudo-blue banter with Paul McCartney's supposed `other' grandfather, a man who seemingly undermines and embarrasses the boys at every opportunity, and arguing over petty matters with their band manager. The film ends with the boys titillating a television studio full of screaming young females.<br /><br />  Several things are apparent in this film: 1) it was designed merely as a moneymaking venture for, despite the brain dead criticism this film is utterly void of any real art, 2) the Beatles simply cannot act and their films, it seems, started their later slide into musical pretension, and 3) the Monkees'- television's Prefab 4 response to Beatlemania were almost infinitely better actors. In fact, their acting range was probably farther beyond the Beatles' than the Beatles' actual musical canon was above theirs, for the Monkees actually were good at improv; the Beatles weren't. And, the film is actually at its best during seeming improves. The clearly scripted moments, which seem less like even a first draft but a first premise, and which have the boys interacting with real actors is excruciatingly painful to watch and hear, as jokes that are decades old, even then, are told with a manic glee that somehow, if a teen heartthrob tells them they will magically regain their humor. One wonders why both of the band's first two films are so poorly made and the answer is rather obvious: producers rushed them through production for fear that the Beatles' popularity would fade and that the Rolling Stones, or some yet discovered group would make them pass&eacute; before the films were released.<br /><br />  The real test of the film's cinematic worth, however, comes from a simple test: if the film had been on a fictive band, made up of actors, singing Beatles songs, would the critics have trumpeted it so? Of course not. Furthermore, they would have used the films of many of the predecessor comedy teams I mentioned as proof of just how derivative this film is. However, this film's cardinal sin is not its pretension, but, aside from its poor technical quality, simply how dull and unfunny it is.e Beatles' popularity would fade and that the Rolling Stones, or some yet discovered group would make them passé before the films were released.<br /><br />  The real test of the film's cinematic worth, however, comes from a simple test: if the film had been on a fictive band, made up of actors, singing Beatles songs, would the critics have trumpeted it so?

B005LLX582|4.0|American film director Terrence Malick's fifth feature film release, in four decades in the business, The Tree Of Life, is a film that, in parts, has some of the greatest techniques and moments ever recorded in film history, but it also has some fatal narrative flaws that prevent it from outright greatness, as an overall work of art, and possibly the worst ending to a near-great film since Akira Kurosawa's 1950 classic, Rashomon, while at the same time having one of the most self-indulgent and showoffy endings to a film since Federico Fellini's 8½. More reprehensible than anything the film does, positively or negatively, is how utterly over the top some praise of the film has been, and how utterly ridiculous some of the criticism of the film has been. Granted, some of this has been generated by Malick, and the promotional efforts for the film, but, frankly, many big name, and lesser name critics, have simply imbued and misconstrued their own critical lack and imaginative dead rot into their reviews, and missed the boat on this film, from some of its most basic elements through its more nuanced themes and evocations.

B006OB3K56|5.0|Overall, Shame is a great film, one which assumes an intelligent audience, and one worthy of pantheon level greatness, in all aspects, from the writing to the technical to the acting- the whole damned package, and an equal or better film than Ingmar Bergman's great film, with which it shares a title, and was even more wildly misinterpreted than this one. Even more so, let me pay its creator the ultimate compliment: if I could get films of my novels made I'd want McQueen to direct them. Shame is great art, and hopefully it will do for the NC-17 rating what Midnight Cowboy did for its predecessor X rating- earn some major Oscar nominations and damn the puerile American film ratings system for good. Another plus it bears is, given that the whole cast, save for Marianne, is white, and set in America, that this film reaches such heights, directed by a black Brit, making it all the more remarkable, and a good herald for a time when, hopefully, in a few decades, critics like me won't even have to mention such things, for, Steve McQueen shares far less in common with hack filmmakers of all backgrounds, especially black hacks like Spike Lee, and for that little bit of heaven I can only end this review as I started it.

B002XUL6RG|5.0|The film treats Sands less as a Christ-like martyr or an Osama-like terrorist, and more as an old time Robert Ripley curio- a believe it or not. Margaret Thatcher, on the other hand, is never seen, merely heard, as almost a Dickensian wraith of malignance and idiocy, and these dual treatments- the brutalizer as bodiless and the brutalized as slowly debodied, are a great example of the subtle poesy the film employs. Technically, the film is interesting in how it juxtaposes image with sound, and sometimes allows sound to be the dominant sense. From early scenes of a guard, outside in winter, smoking a cigaret, and hearing exhalation, to the rancor in multiple scenes of violence, McQueen uses synaesthesia better than just about any other film director around. Also, he makes grand use of the long take, clearly influenced by the works of Theo Angelopoulos and Bela Tarr. In the subgenre of `prison film,' Hunger blows away other lauded films, from Cool Hand Luke to Midnight Express, which are conventional melodramas, in comparison. But, in achieving his realism sans much dialogue, McQueen also shows that he is, in a sense, the anti-Cassavetes, for where Cassavetes achieved such realism with dialogue, in great films like Faces and The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie, by letting characters speak as in real life, McQueen allows characters to react and brood, as in real life. In Cassavetes films, the self is defined by interactions with other selves. In McQueen's film, self is delineated by interaction with oneself.<br /><br />  The screenplay, written by McQueen and Enda Walsh, has many good moments, such as the clean clothes the Brits force the Irish to wear to receive visitors (Otherwise they are naked, in protest of wearing criminals' clothes), a masturbation scene wherein one prisoner, in a cell smeared with feces, somehow feels embarrassed to waken his cellmate with the sounds of his self-pleasure, the scene of how the Brits need to powerwash the excremented cells, only to have the prisoners returned to the cells and break their cots and other furniture in protest- again inflicting almost as much brutality on themselves as the Brits do. And these scenes show exactly why the Brits are so intransigent, since the Irish are so willing to live down to their stereotypes of them. Another technique that McQueen uses over and again is showing brief snippets of a scene, then cutting away, to let the viewer imagine how the rest will play out; but the key is that he never cuts too early, so that the viewer is bewildered as to what is going on. David Holmes soundtrack is one of the best ever recorded, in its use of ambient sound. The cinematography by Sean Bobbitt is precise and emphasizes emotional and visceral reactions in the characters to impart the same to the viewer.<br /><br />  All of these things contribute to the film's greatness, and the film's own lack of pretension only amplifies this fact, in an odd recapitulation of how the use of sound amplifies emotion throughout the film. It's little wonder that this film won the Camera D'Or, the prize for best first feature film, at the Cannes Film Festival, the year of its release, it deserved to. What is odd is some critics comparing the film to Pier Paolo Pasolini's ignominious disaster, Salo, simply because feces plays a role in both films. Nonetheless, Hunger is, unlike Pasolini's film, a great work of art, and here's hoping that McQueen does not go the way of David Gordon Green, in selling out to the Lowest Common Denominator of the masses.

B0008ENIAC|3.0|The film is often called a film noir, but it is really not. For a film to be called film noir there needs to be a gritty realism to it. This is merely melodrama. Film noir penetrates deeply into character. This film is propelled not by character exigencies but by the Dumbest Possible Action theory, and also by having any real world issues too easily solved, as well as that old Hollywood standby- style over substance. But, because the work is immanently melodramatic, the foregrounding of style over any deeper elements, actually makes the film more enjoyable as a guilty pleasure. And, on that score, Mildred Pierce is terrific. No, it is not a film filled with cosmic profundities nor with great performances for the ages. But, it is a film loaded with charm and appeal, and a `who cares if it's over the top?' attitude that damns any claims of pretense, and frees the film into being itself, that guilty soap opera that you love, but don't want anyone else to know you love, unless you tell first. Go ahead, now. It's your turn!

In some ways, this could have been a better set of short stories.<br /><br />I was also somewhat disappointed by the plot twist. I had really hoped for an epic space opera focusing on the 'redshirts' instead of the typical heros.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I read this book in less than a couple of days and would likely loan the book out to others.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This novel was recommended to me by Amazon.com I am assuming because of my browsing and purchase history. I was delighted to see by its description that it was a legal/court/law fictional that takes place in a geographical area that I am familiar with! I am a John Grisham fan but most his novels take place in Mississippi and other surrounding states. I also like Law and Order, but those episodes take place in NY. Defending Jacob takes place near Boston and also makes references to other New England towns.<br /><br />I am really impressed how quickly the novel grabbed me, despite the author not being as famous. I really liked how modern \\"issues\\" such as social networking (ie Facebook, blogging, and text messaging) came into play during the investigation. The author captures the hearts and minds of our present generation's teenagers of whome are growing up in this fast paced technical and computerized world we are living in. Feelings and thoughts (or lack of) are clearly understood by the reader by the way the author by the way that talk, shrug, and facially express themselves. The reader can... \\"like, totally get it.\\"<br /><br />The intriguing, and frightful past of the main character is an important aspect of this story. He is a D.A. and his fourteen year-old son is a suspect in a murder investigation. The D.A.'s thoughts, opinions, and statements may assure the reader that he believes in his sons innocence, but actions of consequence might tell the reader otherwise.<br /><br />Is it a lie to keep something from your past hidden from your loved ones? Can true love a trust prevail despite a deception revealed only because it had to be? Is Jacob innocent or guilty of this murder? I found that truly could not come to my own conclusion of the truth until the end of the novel. The events and underlying principles had me hooked and I could not put my kindle down. Defending Jacob is a one of a kind crime, cop, lawyer, court, mystery novel. This book would also make a great movie!movie!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book has no literary value. It's pornorgraphy. The characters are unbelievable and ridiculous, the story line sophmoric, and the writing style bland. If you have no other sexual outlet, rent a XXX. Don't waste your time with this smut.
0307730697|5.0|This book is very moving as it doesn't contain all of mission and BUDs training events.  It is big on faith of the individual and his family and friends and the tremendous hardships it took this man to become a SEAL elite, which very few can achieve.  It is a tear jerker to be sure but also it shows that if there is a will there is a way and this man proves it time and time again under extremely difficult challenges.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I don't understand why so many reviewers are giving this movie 5 stars when it is more like a 3.0-3.5 star movie (5 stars for visuals, sets and designs). The plot contains too many inconsistencies in an otherwise technically beautiful film.<br /><br />Sci fi movies are supposed to contain intelligent characters. In this film many act in a completely illogical manner, some are even eligible for Darwin awards.<br /><br />The geologist and biologist characters seemed intelligent at first, being skeptical and cautious about the alien environment they were exploring. After they become seperated from their crew the biologist decides it is a good idea to pet the hostile alien snake creature and both end up getting killed or infected in a scene that looks like it was created purely for the spectacle. WTF were they thinking?<br /><br />The geologist later shows up at Prometheus' doorstep as a zombie in an unusual yoga pose (reminiscent of an posessed character in a exorcist/japanese horror film, just plain lame) and none of the crew notice his unusual appearance and end up getting killed.<br /><br />There are many other plot/character irregularities that have been posted all over the internet so I won't repeat them here.<br /><br />I am completely dumbfounded as to how such a critically acclaimed director such as Sir Ridley could approve these scenes. The screenplay writers may be the ones to blame but surely the ultimate responsibility lies with him.

B000P6R6X8|5.0|This record actually got a mediocre review from many fans, but I think it's beautiful. I love the return to basic, straightforward smart rock.<br /><br />As Garrison Keillor said during their appearance on A Prairie Home Companion, \\"The song you just played, Sky Blue Sky, doesn't sound like the alternative to anything, it doesn't sound alt, it just sounds the way music was meant to be played.\\"<br /><br />The slower, insightful \\"Either Way\\", \\"Sky Blue Sky\\", and \\"Please Be Patient With Me\\" are the perfect relaxers between some classic rockers like \\"Shake it Off\\" and \\"Hate it Here\\". And \\"Impossible Germany\\", while it had made many appearances in live shows, this is where it finally stepped up and identified itself and what it really was.<br /><br />\\"Side With the Seeds\\" and \\"Walken\\" are songs I don't normally think to drop the needle on out of the blue, but when they come up while listening to the album as a whole, they are a couple of my favorites to crank up.<br /><br />Every album Wilco has released has settled in with me in different ways. This is one that settled in immediately and has never wavered. While others took awhile to soak in, and others have been forgotten, only to be rediscovered again later, Sky Blue Sky has remained in heavy rotation since they first allowed fans to stream it for free prior to its release, and it shows no signs of leaving the top of my list.
0061726834|3.0|A dystopia in which Lauren Oliver imagines love as a disease that people should protect themselves against. The result: adults without desires, without passions following the rules as unflinchingly brave little sheeps for fear of suffering. Lies in shambles from the government to maintain a population in a blissful ignorance.<br />A society sad to die brilliantly portrayed by Lauren Oliver, as in every dystopian vision may not prevent the reader to wonder... I liked the questions raised by the novel.<br /><br />A mixture of \\"Matrix\\" where no one is truly free, and everyone is monitored. Yet without being as bas as the Big Brother in \\"1984\\" by George Orwell, yet there is a hint of Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" with a population programmed to live a monotonous, peaceful life without realizing that they are maintained in prison. In a climate of fear, people unable to enter in the mold are rotted in prison or are forced to exile themselves or they risked to face a death sentence. So, to avoid problems, young people are indoctrinated from birth to believe in the dangers of love, emotion and affection. Growing up, and before age 18, if they stray off-piste, they are cropped by the people through the betrayal, submit to the control of the police and raids. Any excess is punished. Music, poetry, laughter, friendship or contacts are not encouraged.<br /><br />A society sad to die brilliantly portrayed by Lauren Oliver, as in every dystopian vision may not prevent the reader to wonder... I liked the questions raised by the novel.<br />Is a life without emotions would be more comfortable? Are we already formatted to the point of not reacting to the narrowing of our freedoms to think, act and live? Have adults accepted more easily to fall into line, to follow the rules? For fear of being alone, to suffer would you agree not to make your own choice?<br /><br />I liked the characters encountered in the writings of Lauren Oliver in the first volume and I will follow after their adventures in \\"Pandemonium.\\"<br />Nice discovery.<br /><br />Lucie<br />newbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr

0385341008|4.0|I spent a wonderful time together with this book! During daily trip in the subway, he brought me the minutes of escape that help to start a day or end it on a positive note.<br /><br />Although the topics covered in the letters were not always conducive to great laughter, I was surprised, however, often I was caught smiling. I even came to giggle out loud during some exchanges between Sydney and Juliet. There is a french expression for a book like this one, it says: This book is a good moon in a box!<br />Every time I've open it, I was feeling great!<br /><br />Sometimes the painful memories of war are told by some characters, but the accuracy of the words chosen by the authors is always admirable. The writers talked about sentiments without ever falling into tears or pity. It's novel fresh, positive, full of hope and courage.<br /><br />As Juliet, I wished to meet and know all the Guernsey's characters. Through the pages, they have become dears friends. Who would not like to be part of this circle, talking about books while enjoying a pie and sipping tea? I wanted to try the potions of Isola and see the figurines carved by Eli.<br /><br />I even felt the nostalgia over the lack of correspondence in our time. Of course, we communicate by email or text messages but it will never be as enjoyable as to read than a paper letter. It reminded me of memories of \\"pen friends\\" that I had when I tried to learn a foreign language. But I would have especially loved receiving the stories of Oscar Wild's Cat, wouldn't you ?<br /><br />Even in writing this text, I think of this novel with a smile. This is a book that is good for the soul. A simple story about ordinary people who became extraordinary through the reading of their adventures. A small jewelry definitely to keep on the shelves and read at the first signs of low spirited!<br /><br />Lucie<br />newbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr

0062060562|4.0|I was immediately seduced by the book as soon as I held it in my hands. The simple cover who consiste of an open eye on one side and a closed one on the other was intriguing. Then the back cover review sharpened my curiosity. I could not get rid of this book. Like a detective story, the reader investigates with Christine her own story. Each memory become an index for the young woman and to the reader. I've been vibrated with the daily revelations. When the female character doubts began to increase, the reader become to wonders more and more about the leading of the plot. Madness? Paranoia? Poisoning? Invention? Imagination? You are really looking to unravel fact from fiction in an suspenseful atmosphere. A wonderfull suspense due to an attention to small details.<br /><br />The characters are wonderfull well described by their imperfections and their flaws. The writing is fluid, delicate and captivating. In the labyrinth of Christine's memories, we follow the breadcrumb trail left by SJ Watson until a perfectly well fed end.<br />A brilliant novel that you will not let go.<br />A must read!<br /><br />Lucie<br />newbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr
B000J6I0U2|4.0|\\"Casanova\\"(2005) is directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Cidar House Rules, Chocolat, What's Eating Gilbert Grape). Heath Ledger stars as Casanova in this fictional tale about a Casanova who falls in love with Francesca (Sienna Miller), who writes illegal feminist books under the alias Bernardo Gaudi, all the while the church is after Casanova for his crimes against sexual morality.  When the suitor from Genoa, Paprizzio (Oliver Platt), comes for Francesca things get complicated and the real fun begins as Casanova maneuvers the unwitting Paprizzio and others in an attempt to puts things into his favour with Francesca. Meanwhile the Venetian Inquisition, headed by Jeremy Irons, is closing in on the identity of Casanova, as the Casanova assumes a myriad of identities from the Genoan Paprizzio to the underground writer Bernardo Guardi. This is a bright, sexy, and lively movie with a wonderful cast of actors.

B007SPN5MA|5.0|I have been a fan of Glen Hansard and the Swell Season since I first heard them play on late night TV around the time Once was released.  Glen's solo album, Rhythm and Repose, has been my constant background music for the past week since I first found it posted on NPR.  I bought the album and haven't quit listening.  This album seems more bluesy, with lots of angst over lost love.  Marketa even provides vocals on a few tracks.  There isn't a song on the album that I don't like but my favorites are \\"You Will Become\\", \\"Maybe Not Tonight\\", \\"High Hope\\", \\"Love Don't Leave Me Waiting\\" and \\"What Are We Gonna Do\\".  Beautiful melodies with a quieter tone fill this album. You can feel and hear the sadness expressed in the music but its beauty will bring you many hours of enjoyable listening.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I love the short story format, but seldom (read: never) buy short stories unless they're practically thrown in my face. I have also loved Stephen King since I learned to read in the eighties, so this just had to be an instant hit for me and my brand new Kindle.<br /><br />Mile 81 is closer to the Stephen King I got to know in my youth than the kind of author he is today. The complexity of some of his newest installments is stunning, but also exhausting. After reading 'The Stand' years ago I more or less stopped reading King. Not because it was bad, but it was simply to much. I longed for those short slices of extraordinary life that his earlier work was drained in. The unexplainable, scary and still mostly unexplained.<br /><br />Just read 'Mile 81' It's classic King.
1936608898|4.0|One quote that keeps popping up is \\"this is not hard compared to birthing a baby, quitting heroin, or beating cancer.\\" Actually, it is. I haven't got any experience with heroin, but I had 7 unmedicated births, 2 c-sections, and I beat cancer. Those things are hard, too but that doesn't make this easy. This is hard. It's hard to eat this way in a world that doesn't. It's hard to cook for a big family -- either all eating this way, or them eating this way and me not eating what they're eating. It's hard to stick with it day in and day out. It's not too terribly hard for a few weeks, but it is hard as a lifestyle.  I feel anti-social. I know my eating habits put a damper on others' enjoyment when our eating out choices are dictated by my \\"can'ts.\\"  I know I've offended more than one gracious hostess with my polite, \\"No thank you.\\" And I do miss crafting a perfect loaf of artisan bread or making my grandmother's homemade pasta. I miss tomatoes fresh from the garden with olive oil and fresh mozzarella. I miss handing on food traditions of generations to my own children. I couldn't care less about sugar and I'm not lamenting processed foods at all. They were never in my diet. I'm struggling with the limited choices of real food left for me.<br /><br />Admittedly, because of autoimmune issues, I'm eating the extreme end of this spectrum, eliminating nightshades, eggs, nuts, and coffee in addition to the other foods. This kind of eating got just a passing mention in the book, yet a large population of readers is reading precisely because they're battling autoimmune disease. Note: this book doesn't recommend giving up coffee even in cases of autoimmune disease, but other research (and my personal experience) does bear that out. And giving up coffee wasn't terribly difficult. Peppers, curry seasoning, eggplant... those things are missed.<br /><br />I'm not complaining and I think it's worth it, but I do think that in a future edition, the reader would be better served if there were more practical ways to cope with the everyday challenges of eliminating what is objectively a lot of food choices. For instance, two of the \\"go-to\\" recipes call for nuts. That works for some readers, but it doesn't work for the autoimmune folks. So, what's offered as a standby is just one more (two more) thing on the \\"don't\\" list.<br /><br />I still think this is a valuable resource, but for most folks, longterm success with eating this way is going to take more than, \\"You can do it. It's not as hard as childbirth or cancer.\\"e were more practical ways to cope with the everyday challenges of eliminating what is objectively a lot of food choices. For instance, two of the \\"go-to\\" recipes call for nuts. That works for some readers, but it doesn't work for the autoimmune folks.

B004W2UBYW|1.0|I do not have time to read books, but have my Kindle read them to me while I'm commuting, doing chores, yard work, or walking. I was very miffed that the publisher disabled the text-to-speech function for this title. Aren't there a lot of other busy people like me that this publisher is shafting? What about the vision-impaired? We should boycott publishers who do this, restrict books for extra profits. What do they want to do, make readers who would pay for audio have to turn criminal to find hacked PDFs that will work? Does Amazon want to encourage everyone to use Adobe Reader to read aloud ebooks? These corporate suits have no idea of how rotten this makes them look. Don't get this unless you have time and eyesight to burn. Disgusted in Minnesota!

B007MDB71O|5.0|I thought this was an awesome movie. Unfortunately Disney bombed the advertising and once the media got into a feeding frenzy it had no chance at the theater. I read these books as a kid and have been waiting for years for someone to make a movie. While a few liberties were taken, they did a good job staying faithful to the books. The effects were awesome. I originally saw it in 3d at the theater. Awesome! Watched it on DVD and Blu-ray and the blu-ray knocked the socks off the dvd version. If you're a fan of the books, I highly recommend the movie! Even if you're not, ignore the media/advertising and see it. You won't be disappointed.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|My favorite Rush album is Caress of Steel and what that album has that this one lacks is a crisp, crackling bite to the guitar and a clear depth to the drums and bass. Rush seems to have forgotten the importance of negative space, i.e., intervals between the sounds that give these sounds their definition and, I would argue, their power. The songs on the digitally recorded and over-processed Clockwork Angels are buried in a wall of noise and they must fight to be heard like poltergeists trapped in a snowy television set.<br /><br />As you might guess, I don't listen to a whole lot of modern music and have a bias against albums that are mastered with the amount of dynamic compression that is today's industry standard. This bias isn't just an aesthetic preference. I find that dynamically compressed music tires my ears after about ten minutes. Clockwork Angels may well be a significant sonic improvement over recent recordings like Vapor Trails (I wouldn't know) but it's still not enough to make me want to listen to it.
B007549YM4|1.0|This movie was utter garbage...directed by Xavier Gems and he did Frontier(s) and Hitman. Those are WAY better than this...the actual filming of it was crappy too.

1936608898|5.0|It Starts With Food    The Paleo community is generally very supportive of its own and very quick to write a positive review for a friend or a Paleo luminary. While I generally have positive things to say about most things I review on the internet, I honestly think that It Starts With Food is the best health and fitness product that has come out in the last two years.    I would give It Starts With Food to anyone who is thinking about starting Paleo, who is critical of the whole concept, who has already been successful with it and is looking to tweak a few things, or who can read English (or any other language its published in).    Most diet and fitness books will eventually date themselves. This happened with Professor Cordain's Paleo Diet and Paleo Diet for Athletes. Both of these are great books. Ground breaking in fact. Unfortunately, some of the science is now a bit dated.    The same will probably happen to Robb Wolf's Paleo Solution and the plethora of other clean eating books that have recently been or are soon to be published. Its an inevitable part of the advance of science. Understandings of different pathways and new theories eventually make old understandings obsolete or slightly inaccurate.    I do not see this happening with It Starts With Food. Dallas and Melissa Hartwig are probably the first publishers in the history of diet and exercise to have the confidence in their message and enough persuasion and common sense in their arguments to be able to afford to admit that they do not have all of the answers.    I'll take the advice of someone who understands what they do not know and acknowledges that current nutrition science has an incomplete understanding of human biology over someone who claims to understand all of the mysteries of the universe any day.    There is a big difference between knowing and doing.  The Hartwigs wrote this book for the kinesthetic learner as much as the wrote it for the visual learner. Not only are the explanations placedin simple terms, but the explanations on how to implement this new lifestyle charge are as vivid and easy to comply with as is humanly possible to write.    In the military, we teach people to give orders as a series of tasks, conditions, and standards. In no unsure terms, It Starts With Food gives you the the steps and standards for success in this life style shift.    It Starts With Food is also a witty, easy read. I read it on the flights to Memphis from Columbus, GA and back. This was maybe a total of five airport hours. Subtract ample twitter and Facebook time and it becomes apparent that this book is a quick read.    It Starts With Food is funny, easy to understand, and more importantly easy to follow.    The list of contributors and editors reads like a whose who of the brightest and most competent minds in Paleo. The recipes are great (I've made two), the science is Kraken proof, and the advice works. Every chapter starts with a testimonial just in case you think that this is some ivory tower theory about how eating real food will make you healthier.    The conciseness of the book is simply astounding. They cover everything from theory to practice, fat loss to the pursuit of elite athleticism, alcohol to sleep.    I literally wanted to tweet every other sentence while I read it.    I'm giving this book to my mother, my friend whose a vegetarian doctor, a buddy in Afghanistan, and every girl I take out on a first date as prerequisite reading from now on.    [...]

B0085157B8|1.0|I watched the first movie and it was okay. This second movie wasn't even okay, it felt like a B movie. The storyline connected with the first movie and did more than I expected.<br /><br />The characters they had didn't matter to me because there was no character development. You just know which one is which, and they don't go any further then that. Cop, amusement park Owner, amusement park Owner' daughter, amusement park Worker, and so on.<br /><br />This movie did not do so good because instead of doing what a good movie does with storyline, character development, movie direction, etc - this movie just throws a whole lot of BIG BOOBS at the viewers. That's what a B movie would do as well. All they do is have a lot of boobs shots and this movie is no different at it.<br /><br />The special effects were as good as the first one. But, they did not use that much and the Piranha did not even show up as many times as the first.<br /><br />People that really liked the first and how it was done would HATE this one. People that just want to see big boobs would love this. I do not recommend this movie as a buy and only a rent.

Even if you know that a \\"dinner jacket\\" is a tux, if you're American you'll still say tux...
B007WEYGPC|5.0|This book is very inspirational, and good read. It describes the setting of the southern living back in the day of slavery. The plot of the story is, Scout Finch, daughter of Atticus Finch, watches her father defend a black man, who is accused of rape. This is a fun story, compassionate, loving, and dramatic. I believe all people should read this, sometime in their education, that way they can be inspired and learn from their adventure.

B004VJJF34|4.0|I checked this movie out from the library - not knowing what to expect - and after watching it, I simply cannot put into words how completely genius, strange, dark, and exciting this movie is! First of all, the chemistry between Deniro and Minnelli was so raw and real - you felt like you were watching a couple's private life as a fly on the wall. The sets are so strangely over the top that it just works! Also, the musical numbers - particularly the infamous \\"Happy Endings\\" number towards the end of the film was utterly amazing. You can't help but think of the songs/scenes days after. The story was a bit slow at times - but it was also very watchable and again, really stuck with you after seeing it. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who a.) Enjoys Scorcese films b.) Is a Robert Deniro Fan c.) A Liza Minnalli fan or d.) Simply enjoys a great drama or musical. I have no clue why this movie hasn't stood the test of time the way so many others have from this era. You will be reminded why Deniro is considered such an acting legend but also confused as to why Minnelli didn't make more films or why she isn't regarded as cinema's greatest talents. Overall, great movie and even better on blu ray!

0470449764|4.0|The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review boasts three hundred former exam questions to help you prepare for the GMAT.  All of the questions used here have been retired from the exam, so don't expect to receive any gifts.<br /><br />The book opens with a dry 35-page review of mathematical concepts that you need to know for the exam.  The red meat of the book is the 176 practice questions in the problem-solving section, and the 124 data sufficiency practice questions.<br /><br />Half of these three hundred questions aren't very hard, but they exhibit two features to keep in mind for the exam:  1) Read the question - and be sure that you are solving for what they ask, and 2) Time Traps - There are some questions that could take you three minutes to solve, but if you approach it another way, you can solve the problem in under a minute.<br /><br />You can make the easy questions work for you by practicing under time pressure.  Set out to solve the first 40 questions in each section in, say, 45 minutes, then try solving the next 40 questions in, say, one hour.  You may find yourself making `stupid' mistakes, but you can learn from this.  For example, the time pressure may cause you to write too quickly and illegibly, causing calculation errors.  Or you may `save time' by skipping intermediate steps, but then you find out that you've transposed signs and found the wrong answer.  Whatever it is that causes you to make these mistakes, you can work them out by practicing.<br /><br />There are also time-saving tricks that you might forget, or may not feel comfortable doing under time pressure.  Now is the time to work on these tricks.  This is why it pays to look at the problem resolutions, even if you have the correct answer.  You may learn a trick that can save you time.<br /><br />Because data sufficiency problems are unique, one can find some reassurance that the GMAT offered 124 of them for practice.  Practicing these problems really do make them less daunting.  Iwould recommend that you solve at least 250 data sufficiency problems before taking the exam.<br /><br />This lean (215 page) study guide is essential for your GMAT preparation.  You can get away without it if you have the Official Guide for GMAT Review.
B0063IH60K|4.0|would be perfect without ads. at least the ads never interrupt the game, just between each deal. using my own images for the deck and table is nice.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books are great to read. Although they are short, they are an easy read and hard to put down. The storyline is something new and unique. Buy it!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|would love to have the same updated version that is available for my Droid...and would love Angry Birds Space free for Kindle.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish someone had told me what a waste of time reading this book would be. The main character is a silly mixed up girl who we are suppose to believe is smart. The male character is the flawed prince charming who has the dimensions of a cartoon character. Believe me this book is a complete waste of time.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It works great when I download different songs. I have had nothing but good things with it on my Kindle Fire. Get the app.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|So many people dislike this album and I tried to find out why. I looked through numerous professional reviews of \\"Zeitgeist\\" and below are the two main reasons why it was so unloved:<br /><br />1) It's too heavy.<br />2) It's not the real Smashing Pumpkins.<br /><br />Those don't seem like terribly good reasons, do they? The last time the Smashing Pumpkins made an album that was \\"soft\\", the fans ripped them apart. And yes, I do like \\"Adore\\". This time around, people attacked their bombast. Make up your minds, guys. As for the name, it's just a name. Big freaking deal.<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" is a listenable album. What do I mean by that? It's got melodies, and this tunefulness warrants the hard-hitting sound. Usually the idea of having numerous producers on one album can be absurd, reeking of top 40's bad habits. But here, the fact that Roy Thomas Baker produced only some of this album assures the listener that \\"Zeitgeist\\" is varied just enough to not be considered inconsistent. \\"Doomsday Clock\\", \\"God & Country\\" and \\"Pomp & Circumstance\\" all come from different places but don't sound out of place alongside one another. And does anyone else think that the guitar solo in \\"Tarantula\\" sounds like Brian May? I think I heard somewhere that \\"Queen II\\" was a personal favorite of Corgan's.<br /><br />My personal favorites are \\"7 Shades of Black\\", \\"Bleeding the Orchid\\" and \\"That's the Way My Love Is\\". And Jimmy Chamberlain never fails to make a song better. Too bad he's no longer in the band, but this new kid sounds like he's shaping up pretty well.<br /><br />In short, hating \\"Zeitgeist\\" just became too acceptable. With the new album \\"Oceania\\" coming out, so many fans are saying \\"well, it should be better than 'Zeitgeist'.\\" As for me, I'm still trying to find fault with it. And I can't. And I was as skeptical as everyone else!
B007UR1OHO|5.0|Excellent Movie,  Based on true events always makes for a good movie and this didn't disappoint me. Definately a good watch.
0307730697|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. Period. An unbelievable story about an apparently unbelievable guy. Words in a review really can't express how amazing this story is from start to finish. This is one that will stick with you long after you've read it, and everyone will wish they had the courage and attitude of Adam Brown. I almost wish I hadn't read this story - just so I could read and experience it like it was the first time all over again.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad its on the kindle fire it is so much fun.It is a lot of fun and its really easy but yet so hard.
B000005HCM|5.0|If you're in a bad mood, one that you can kick with some good feeling music, this is the go-to stuff.  Within one chorus of the title track,you'll forget what you were pissed about.  That's the highest tribute there is.<br /><br />Everyone else has said what I was thinking. So, I'll just add that Lee Morgan is right up there with the best players of his time - Freddie Hubbard, Booker Little - and rates consideration among the best ever.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Beautiful collection.  She has a great, sultry, sweet voice.  Also got it as a great deal from Amazon, which made it even better!
B0074MZSPO|4.0|My buddy, O, has been putting me straight about new groups for about 40 years.  He laid this one on me last month, and he's done it again.  This band cooks - reminds me of the way Little Feat can play in so many styles - and the singer is just spectacular.  My first impression was that she reminded me of Amy Winehouse (which for me is a good thing),  but that is just one of the things you hear.  She's powerful and expressive.  Good songs too.
B0086700CM|5.0|the app is great for long road trips. I would totally recommend this to my friends. you should have patience if it is your first time.
B0074MZSWW|2.0|Just popped this on Spotify, not knowing anything about the band, whether or not they're hip and cool according to Pitchfork or whomever, never of course seen them live ... and I have to say ... this record is decidedly unimpressive to me.<br /><br />For one, this style of music has been mined endlessly by everyone to the Stones and Zeppelin over the years to Amy Winehouse and the Black Keys ... and in all those cases ... much better than it's done here, frankly.<br /><br />For another ... isn't it about time we put to rest the whole 'retro-recording sound' for good, except in special cases where the music really calls for it (an example off the top of my head would be the way that the song 'The Good Life' by Justin Townes Earle is recorded)?  The crappy old lo-fi recording just for the sake of ... whatever it's done for the sake of ... was tired when Oasis did it with \\"What's The Story?\\" in 1994, and it's certainly not any fresher now.<br /><br />The singer sounds like she might be pretty good live, and may be great in 10 years, but on this album, I'm sorry to offend anyone, but I find her vocals annoying.  She sounds like she's doing a cut-rate Robert Plant impression.  The quality of the recording here I suspect is doing her no favors.  From what I hear on this disc, to see her name appear in the same sentence as Janis or Otis ... this is surely the height of blasphemy.<br /><br />Looking over the reviews, then listening to the actual record, I have to conclude that either people just really LIKE these band members, like 'personally', for whatever reason, or all the hipster music rags are proclaiming these guys as the coolest new thing since ... I dunno, Fleet Foxes, or Bon Iver ... and everyone here is lining up to echo the music critics that define 'what's good' for them.  That's about all I can deduce from listening to this disc.  That, or everyone here has seen them live, and they totally rock, so ... it makes this disc good by default.<br /><br />Because honestly, this record doesn't have much going for it in my humble opinion.  Maybe eventually with better production, better chops, and better, more original songs, this band will turn out to be great.  And I'm willing to entertain the idea that they're GREAT live, they sound like they might be.  But to me this particular recorded outing is derivative, poorly produced, and borderline annoying to listen to.<br /><br />No offense to anyone that likes this album, I just call it like I hear it.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|The disc is in great condition, however there are labels on the case that makes it appear it was once in a rental store. This was not specified in description, so this is a bit frustrating.
B005K17RU0|5.0|App works very well...had no problems....good maps and easy navigation allows more than one city at a time too!!!!! would recommend to anyone...it works just as good on my kindle as my phone.
0307592731|5.0|I've read the previous reviews.  Some very long and some where the reader disliked the book.  I have few words to say.  For me it was a joy to read.  Perhaps those who considered it a pity party didn't lose their mothers.  I could fully identify with Cheryl's pain.  Her trip on the PCT makes me wish I were younger and not afraid of making this journey, especially alone.  I too shed tears at the end of her quest.  I raise my hat to you Cheryl.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|In 1966, the year I arrived from Castro's Cuba, Gene Roddenberry's groundbreaking sci-fi classic Star Trek set out to capture the minds and hearts of fans across generations. Nearly forty-five years later, the special effects may look rudimentary, but the plot and the characters are legendary. The acting is superb, led by the triumvirate of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley. Here at last is the first season of the original series 29 episodes in their original broadcast order. That means starting with \\"The Man Trap,\\" on to many other adventures going boldly where no man has gone before- traveling thru outer space, time or thru a different dimension, confronting Romulans, Klingons, that treacherous Harry Mudd guy, and the unforgettable Ricardo Montalban as Khan among many others. The two-part \\"The Menagerie\\" (which recycled footage from the original pilot, \\"The Cage,\\" which featured Christopher Pike as the captain of the Enterprise is not included in this set).
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard app, works great and fast.  I had to uninstall Swiftkey X before it would upgrade to 3.0 by re-downloading and installing.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Works as advertised. Easy to administer and a solid product. My old thermal paste for my graphics card had worn out and this replacement worked great. Keeps my GPU at manageable temperature levels.
B002RI9MZC|5.0|William Boyd obviously has a profound understanding of the human condition and the skill to express many varied permutations thereof in a wonderful, insightful and thoroughly entertaining book. He is definitely on my list of worthwhile authors.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I understand some of the negative feedback here.  When I first heard this album, I wasn't sold at all.  It was all just a bunch of noise.  But from past Rush albums I've learned that, for me at least, it takes quite a few listens to get through the outer layers and find the gem.  I've let CA live in my life for a while now and find it to be one of my favorite Rush albums.  Being Rush it's quirky, has lofty goals, goes all over the place, and takes a major zig zag at the end.  Many will hate it, but to me all the songs are good and it flows well even if it's not \\"even\\", starting with an onslaught in Caravan then slowly, gradually settling down to The Garden. The writing's good, the lyrics are interesting, the playing is top notch, and the sound is at the very least, very good - simple and clear with clean bass, generally just two guitars, and clear drums and vocals.  That's one complaint I don't understand - the sound - cranking up The Anarchist is nothing but rewarding, and I can't wait to feel it live.  Having heard the first two tracks for literally years now, I generally skip them, and I find the album starts very well with title track.  The initial onslaught quickly drops into a smooth, catchy first verse, which for me is one of the most intriguing transitions they've ever written.  That opening has played in my head countless times.  I love The Anarchist, especially the bass pedal backed climax, but I'm also a big fan of the chorus.  Halo Effect could be an Aimee Mann song, but one of her best.  Seven Cities of Gold has a great bass driven intro and stands well as a classic Rush song, the lyrics, the playing, the sound...  BU2B2 - odd but interesting; another of Neil's Pantoum(ish) works.  The Garden.  Don't know - an 80'sish ballad. Weird and soft, but still a great song and an oddly appropriate closing.  Overall I'm highly pleased to have this in my collection and expect it to have a long and busy life.
0521675804|1.0|This really is a GREAT book.<br />It is British English as all ESL teachers will know.<br />It is however an American copied BLACK and WHITE version.<br />The pages are cheap paper - not the coated orange/red paper from the UK version.<br />It is a straight copy of the UK version but beware.<br />We ESL teachers buy durable books because lap tops, photo copy machines are not always available.<br />These pages will rip easily so weigh your options or download the 2nd edition off the net.

B0009IW88A|5.0|if u love score to the movies and u r a huge batman fan like myself, u will love the score to batman begins and the dark knight. they are great.<br />the scores to the movies are so much better than the orginal soundtracks. highly recommend this score. AWESOME!!
B007VT6QSI|5.0|Justin Bieber's `Believe' is one of those rare CD's that you can listen to straight through, without pressing the skip-to-the-next-track button.  It is a purely enjoyable collection of very well written, produced, and expertly sung songs, that put the sounds of summer back in the air.<br /><br />I have been following Justin's career since 2009, and as a 71 year old grandfather I consider myself his oldest fan.  Having loved pop music since the 1950's, I don't consider any music off limits.  It is therefore hard for me to understand the narrow minded views of some supposed music lovers, who dump on this album.<br /><br />There are terrific club/dance tunes on this CD like \\"All Around the World\\" and \\"As Long As You Love Me,\\" beautiful dreamy ballads like \\"Catching Feelings: and \\"Fall,\\" direct guitar-driven love songs like \\"Be Alright,\\" cutting humor as in \\"Maria,\\" and what could easily be a Jackson 5 long lost gem in \\"Die In Your Arms.\\"<br /><br />In 2010 we attended a Bieber arena concert and it was pure fun.  At 16 he managed to captivate an audience of 15,000 people for a full 90 minutes.  He has only improved over the past two years and it is clear that he is here to stay.  The \\"haters\\" are peeing their own pants and depriving themselves of first class music by avoiding this CD.  I highly recommend that anyone who really likes music to check this album out.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Again if u r a batman fan like myself, u will love this score also. of it has a darker theme than batman begins. but it is also awesome.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This story is highly unlikely....but not beyond the realm of possibility ...however, though technically well written, I came away with the feeling that the book was a sophomoric attempt at describing the unusually \\"unique\\" sexual awakening off a young woman.

B005ZOCF5E|5.0|Recent trends in science fiction have portrayed the future as bleak dystopias. However some recent novels have bucked this trend. Kim Stanley Robinson's '2312' released earlier in 2012 and Alastair Reynolds's 'Blue Remembered Earth' now released in the US are examples of a new kind of utopia - one where the setting of the novel exists after a period of serious problems. They are not perfect visions of the future. But they are not despairing ones either.<br /><br />Reynolds' future is not a total utopia though. Climate change did wreak havoc on Earth in the 21st century. But technology rose to meet the challenges of a warming world. The climate has been repaired. Still there were \\"resource and relocation wars\\". But that is now in the past of this novel. The present of the novel itself is one where \\"Mandatory Enhancements\\", literally genetic engineering and an omnipresent world wide system have made humanity more peaceful. That itself does sound like a dystopia to me, where free will has been altered, but it seems an accepted part of the setting. It does give something to think about though. The present is also one where life enhancing technology has been developed so that people routinely live well into their second century.<br /><br />That is the world that Reynolds has created. As for the story itself, it begins with a death. The death of Eunice Akinya, matriarch of one of the Earth's richest families. Now her grandchildren are put on a quest to discover her legacy. Taking the reader from Africa, the dominant geopolitical power of 22cd-century Earth, to the Descrutinized Moon, where a colony is not constantly watched over by a \\"benign world system\\", to the moons of Mars and beyond, this book is at heart the story of a family coming together and finding itself at a significant point in human history. A point that promises to change the future of humanity itself. Blue Remembered Earth is a point when \\"possibilities are opening rather than closing\\".<br /><br />Reading like both a thriller and a mystery, the book is the first in a trilogy called Poseidon's Children. It is a trilogy that I look forward to continuing in 2013 when the next installment comes out. Until then I hope that 'Blue Remembered Earth' signals a turn in science-fiction - a turn to more hopeful visions of the future.like both a thriller and a mystery, the book is the first in a trilogy called Poseidon's Children.

0451169514|5.0|Reviewers here have written a lot about this novel, which is really King's best. When I first read it about 20 years ago, I slogged through it for the sake of the story line but re-reading many times has deepened the experience and made me appreciate that, Cujo and all, King can be a supremely talented writer.<br />What's good? Like one of his big influences, Ray Bradbury, King is at his best when he is writing about children, specifically children \\"at a certain age\\", between childhood and adulthood. For him, as for Bradbury in stories like The Halloween Tree and Something Wicked This Way Comes, this is a magical age, but one that seems to make them singularly open to the unexpected and magical, supernatural experience. They go about their usual business, negotiating between angry or remote adults, best friends, neighbourhood bullies, strict teachers only to turn a corner and find themselves in a world where all the laws and expectations are demolished and the unthinkable happens...reality becomes sometimes evil, sometimes horrifying, sometimes magic - a world that is indisputably there but which adults cannot see or share.<br />The prime evil in the novel is the clown, but as this story ripens, the children's idea of what is not right in their world goes deeper than that. As the story unfolds, the horror of the clown and the inexplicable murders grip the children one by one but also there is a dawning realization that, in ordinary life, an evil lurks that is almost as horrifying, if not more so...the remoteness of Bill's parents toward him after the death of his brother, the strange and violent nature of Beverley's father, the increasing violence of the bullies who hunt Ben, whose whose egotistical bullying turns murderous and the adults who do not seem to see any of this at all. As King's children observe in one instance where the bullies are chasing Bev, the adults turn away and that is the scariest of all, because regardless of the source of evil there is no where to turn. Not from Bev's dad, not from the bullies, not from the clown. They are singularly on their own, until they join forces with each other because of their shared perceptions and their shared \\"outsiderness\\". They are the Losers and they gain strength from that.<br />What else is good? his portrayal of children betweentimes, their silliness, their strong and unspoken bond with each other, the \\"kidness\\" of their dialogue...each of them is a fully rounded character, people we have been and knew at some early points in our lives.<br />King's novel is a complex one - it will make you shudder, laugh, and sometimes bring tears to your eyes with the gentle wistfullness of his writing. Worth the journey
B003Y5H5F6|1.0|Uninteresting charactors. Cliche' story. Bad dialogue. Dialogue constisting of mistrust, whining and complaining. Predictable. Pointless action. Pointless violence. A super giant werewolf that seemed to be the highlight of the whole crappy film. Len Wiseman and company chose poor writers and even worse directors. Len Wiseman should have done whatever it took to retain Danny McBride, he knows the story and legacy the best. Without the McBride writing and Wiseman directing, it just isn't worth anything more than a saturday night straight to video B-movie. Which is in fact all it was with a good budget. Everything about this piece of crap was BAD to the truest difinition.

B004EPYZTE|4.0|First of all this was an attempt at a re-imagination. Look at most re-makes. They're carbon copies with CGI instead of prostecticts. The very last 30 seconds was GOD AWFUL, but I try to ignore that one little thing for the remainder of the film. I'll admit it was crap, but I enjoyed the new hyperactive Conan, he had a furious energy that helped move along the movie to the GOD AWFUL ending. I mean he didn't kiss the girl goodbye. How can you not do that. but anyways... Just watch it and decide for yourself.

I'll buy a stack of books for my two-year-old daughter, and she'll love some of them and hate others, and I'm never sure exactly why because they all seem great to me.  Moo Baa La La La is one of those books I ordered on a whim, but I'm really glad I did!  Within a couple readings, my daughter was asking for this book, and within a couple days, she was \\"reading\\" it out-loud to herself from memory.  Astonishing!  This book really clicks with young children, and I highly recommend it.
B000F8O35U|5.0|this is a great movie one great thing with Disney they make all there animated movies for both boy and girls.  this movie has memorable songs like (under the sea) and (part of your world).  this movie is 23 yrs old.  see the story is areal the mermaid want's to be human so bad that she has to decide to be human or mermaid if human then she can be with the man of her dreams if mermaid she lives with her mermaid family either or.  this platinum edition is just what i got.  they were for a short amount of time before the little mermaid went back into the vault.  like 1 or 2 years.  enjoy this timeless tale.
B007JMW46U|4.0|This is such a nice text, not only because it introduces great mystery stories but fantastic images. These kinds of stories were, are and will be for developing a critical, reflective and smart reading.
B0000696I1|5.0|i love this comic movie one i am into super hero movies and comic books.  when i was young this was popular.  there was even a TV show from the 80's to the 90's.  in this movie they got to go back in time to ancient japan.  to fix the wrong going on.
034580404X|3.0|Did I just read Twilight again?? There are so many similarities between these series!<br />1) Her mannerisms: being clumbsy and biting her lip.<br />2) His dark dangerous secret.<br />3) She lived with her dad (well her stepdad who she considers her dad) and her mom moved some place hot wwith her new husband.<br />4) He is rich and plays the piano.<br />5) She can do nothing but read books and thinks she is too average, yet every guy likes her.<br />6) He is adopted.<br />7) Oval wedding ring and wedding at his parents house.<br /><br />And there are probably more! Yes, I understand  some similarities with with Twilight are okay and understandable but really? Throughout the whole series all I could think of was Twilight!<br /><br />Also she repeats herself so much it is ridiculous! I know some people have already said this but that just made me angry. The entire series is the same thing happening over and over again with a few interjections of unexpected issues! Through all these annoying problems in the book that I was turned off by the love story got me through it. Maybe it's  just me because I am a sucker for a love story but I found it very sweet. Through all his wierd problems their love got them through it and he quit his strange habits because he loved her. I thought some things and lines they said were very sweet but also repeated. All in all it was okay but I still can't believe i spent $30 on this series!!
B007MAETA8|5.0|First I am a guitarist and songwriter, and have played music live on a relatively small level locally, but I \\"get\\" the music industry now.  I don't get fanatical over artists, nor jump on bandwagons of who's hot-- I just appreciate good well-written catchy music.<br /><br />When I first heard John Mayer (Why Georgia) I thought he was another crap artist from MTV like the stupid boy bands. He fell on deaf ears. I also admittedly was not into that style of music at the time. I liked post grunge, nu-metal, old metal, hard rock, 80s rock...stuff like that at the time. But I grew up on pop music, folk music, 70s rock music, and 80s-alt music (ie. Boingo, Cure, U2, etc.) before I even knew what I liked. When I found John, I had given up my metal ways and was searching for guitar inspiration...and with the perfect timing of Continuum and my heart getting broken, the mind-meld was set faster than Spock could ever do on Star Trek. We were on the same page...Callback to bluesy music? Yes! Crazy riffs and wailing solos? Yes! (Try playing Heart of Life or the acoustic version of Neon from \\"Where the light is\\"). Sad depressing songs to say what I wished I could say? Yup. Continuum had it's hooks in me. I then went backwards to the earlier albums and at that point I was a (closet) fan for life -- my metal friends would never know! But then I dropped the facade when Battle Studies came out and stepped out and into his concert. Just awesome ripping solos, with a jaw-dropping guitar arsenal at his disposal too! I'm a proud fan now. And I want his guitar collection...but I digress...<br /><br />So when this album came out John had a lot to prove to me. I wanted to hear the next ripping blues solo; the sad song that would let me cry my heart out. But I didn't get that. Not at first. I thought \\"This is bad...c'mon John you can do better!\\". I didn't like the glaring echos to Crosby Stills and Nash songs, Neil Young harmonicas over acoustic tracks, the lack of awesome bluesy solos he didon Continuum and Battle Studies, and the kicker was the obvious Bob Seger \\"Mainstreet\\" rip-off riff in \\"Shadow Days\\". But after a few weeks of running it over and over, \\"Queen of Cali' \\", \\"Something Like Olivia\\" and \\"Walt Grace's...\\" are by far as epic songs as \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\" and as pop-y and catchy as \\"Half of My Heart\\" and \\"Who Says\\" and even as far back as \\"Your body is a Wonderland\\".<br /><br />I hear what he did. I watched the interviews and I get the \\"I did the album for me\\" attitude. \\"Heavier Things\\" and \\"Room for Squares\\" were his foot in the door/catch-the-Dave-Matthews-wave  albums. \\"Continuum\\" and JM Trio he was established and wrote from his heart, played the music he wanted to, and he launched up the charts. \\"Battle Studies\\" he was at the height of his success and had to write the album we expected after \\"Continuum\\". But bad press forced him away into seclusion, and this album came from him just wanting to make good songs--write obvious yet catchy, but not forced lyrics over easy to listen to music. These are the songs he sat a home and sang to himself in his bedroom. Not the songs the record label is snapping their fingers at and pushing for charting of the single that will push the current number one off it's pedestal. Not the songs that have to out-do a previous album. Just \\"good\\" songs.<br /><br />The Seger riff still bugs me, but I can usually hear past it now. When I listen to his other albums from front to back, this one is more cohesive from track to track. Although he still has the \\"girl broke my heart\\" songs on this album they are less sad compared to the Continuum ones (those were my fav's when I had a broken heart). The riffs aren't anywhere close to \\"Neon\\" but they have great progressions and cadences. I even considered having my 70yr old dad check out this album as the coolest music he's ever listened to outside classical music is CS&N and CCR -- but this he might like.  This album is a lyric album-- not a flashy solo album, or a heavy acoustic fingerstyle album. Listen to it without comparison to his other albums or what else is out there on the radio/TV. Listen to the influences of those 70's iconic folk-acoustic bands in the songs and lyrics, like CS&N in \\"Born and Raised\\", or Neil Young in \\"Whiskey...\\". It took me a while to bring my walls down, but once you appreciate it at that level and understand where it came from from a songwriter's perspective, you will love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing. It's the first book I've read that has a sequel better than the first one. Catching Fire had more action and it had more twists. I couldn't stop reading this book. It's a must read for any reader.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Although I thought it was a poorly written book and the sentence structuring annoyed me, I wanted to read it til the end!<br />Mr Grey's character is so far fetched and I found him to be quite annoying - almost Carrie Bradshaw whiny but again, I wanted to read it til the end.<br />I personally think that my year 12 English essay was better written but that's just my opinion!!<br />If you like a book that's easy to read, doesn't involve thinking and is pure escapism, give this a go.<br />You'll be entertained, surprised, startled, feel yourself blushing, you'll laugh out loud and you'll think seriously about reading the next 2 books out of pure curiosity.
0345803485|2.0|I am so tired of reading books like this and Twilight.  Why?  Why?  Why can't the strong dominant one be a female for a change??  Why didn't I write for a living, this book makes it look so easy, and make millions, just by writing sex scenes?  At least my novel would be oh so different.  Forget the wimpy, whiney females; I can't get past it to see their other characteristics.<br />How would you guys like a female who is strong, tough, beautiful, RICH, and can have whomever she desires (and has)...except one person, who is already married.  Of course she will end up wanting this person...who happened to be her childhood playmate; who, by the way, is NOT drop dead gorgeous. Yes, lots and lots of exotic scenes, where she tries to satisfy herself with others.  Not possible.  She wants that one.  Causes LOTS of trouble.  Do they end up together?  What about the poor wife?  Does she have a chance against the Rich, Beautiful Bitch? Well, find out...buy my book!  (Which is unfortunately not available)<br />My point? Am so tired of the dominant male; wimpy, beautiful female that males fall all over for.  SOMEONE MIX THINGS UP ALREADY!!
0375869026|5.0|This book is simply wonderful (pun intended:)). A must read for upper elementary and middle school aged kids - and parents, too. It delivers a fantastic, hope-filled message without ever feeling preachy.<br />August was a singularly special character to root for - the tears I cried were good tears!<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough!
0307951529|5.0|Chris Guillebeau $100 Startup is a great little book. It may not be for everyone, but for those it is for, I think it's a very valuable piece of information. Plus just about anyone could make use of the lessons in this book, if they chose to do so. Like the book says: If you have an idea or a passion start working on it now, don't wait for things to be perfect. Of course, thing never will be perfect and the sooner you get started the sooner you can start being successful. Another great read I would like to recommend is [[ASIN:B00851Y7PA Google: The Ultimate Guide To Building And Marketing Your Business With Google (Adwords, YouTube, Google+, Google Analytics, Google Apps, Google Places)]] And easy and informative read!!

B007SYWFRM|1.0|I am terribly  upset with amazons kindle fire free version of Ice Age Village. Yes this may have been a free app to down load ...it has hidden cost behind it.<br />I downloaded it for my 6 year to entertain him. Little did I know that as I was driving he / the game was asking him to get or acquire more gear or treasure it was charging my bank account. This is highly fraudulent. The games are listed as free. The young person playing the games doesn't realize the extras are not free. Does this system tell them its going to cost money/<br /><br />This needs to be corrected. And a full refund should be give to to those who unknowingly trusted that a free app was just that a free app.

B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow! Great storyline! This is definitely not some cheesy love story. It is action packed and relatable. The characters are easy to fall in love with and the story keeps you wanting more page after page. I could not put this book down and would highly recommend reading it yourself. I'm glad I bought the sequel at the same time so there wouldn't be a break in the story, I simple had to know what was going to happen! Enjoy!!
1401207529|5.0|James Gordon and his wife Barbara (Not to be confused with Batgirl) have arrived in Gotham City where they will settle as she is pregnant with their first child. James is now working for the Gotham City Police Department and after a dozen years Bruce Wayne has been living somewhere else until he comes back as he makes himself Batman to do justice to the city of Gotham and fight crime in honor of his parents's death that he witnessed when he was a child. However, Gordon has problems of his own as he is trying to find out who is this mysterious man dressed up as a bat, Gordon becomes conflicted on either becoming a friend or foe to this new vigilantee especially dealing with a corrupted police force which he will soon be the commissioner.<br /><br />An amazing and complex rebooted origin story from comic genius Frank Miller! in 1986 DC decided to update Superman, Wonder-Woman and other DC heroes for a fresh new angle and Batman was no exception. Frank Miller and artist/co-writer David Mazzucchelli came up with a fresh update on the Batman mythos after Miller's brilliant Dark Knight Returns comic book back in 86 as back in early 87 they did a 4 part mini-series for issues 404 till 407 for it brought Batman for a new generation to readers young and old alike. It was later in 1988 released as a single book called graphic novel as it with Killing Joke and Dark Knight Returns have brought back the dark image of Batman after people were exposed with the 60's show and his Superfriends cartoon. This also re-introduces Catwoman as it tells how she was a hooker turned anti-hero but despite Catwoman has always been one of my boyhood comic character crushes i really don't like how Frank Miller made her an unattractive shaved headed Sinead O'Conner-lookalike hooker which just kills it for me but still this is an excellent Batman story.<br /><br />Quality storytelling by Miller and great artwork by Mazzucchelli made this the most popular Batman story after Dark Knight Returns for it's loaded with action, excellent writing and thrills galore. I first read back issues of this comic when i was 14 in the mid 90s at one of my local comic book stores and thought it was fantastic but late bought the graphic novel. I applaud Miller for making Batman cool again with Dark Knight Returns and this as it helped inspired many comic book makers to filmmakers like Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan and animator Bruce Timm for their incarnations of Batman and you can tell that Batman Begins was influenced by this masterpiece.<br /><br />This graphic novel also contains 40 pages of never before seen developemental material including character sketches and layout sketches, sample script pages, sample storyboards, early sample art from David Mazzucchelli, afterwards by Miller and David and that sort of thing.t's loaded with action, excellent writing and thrills galore.

B007L6VR12|5.0|This movies is brilliantly written by director Wes Anderson, and this is arguably his best film yet. Starring many famous actors and actresses (and new actors) such as Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward, Frances McDormand, and Tilda Swinton. This movie will make you laugh and cry at the same time. Check it out it is definitely worth it!!!
B007P6VLRS|5.0|It seems like all the artists I listen to that have had a string of bad records or took some time off have been making some great comeback records. Smashing Pumpkins, thankfully, are not the exception to this trend. I never cared for Zeitgeist, it felt over produced and like Corgan was trying way to hard. Oceania feels like an actual SP records, very heavy, spacey, a bit psychedelic,  and is the best the band has sounded since the Machina albums. Even Corgans voice sounds more sure this time around.<br />Fans of Siamese Dream era Pumpkins will especially find this album refreshing, it goes back to basics yet stays current.
0783233477|1.0|I didn't like this film; thought it was weird.  Made me uncomfortable. I felt all the characters in the film felt uneasy too.  But then I don't like Science Fiction movies. (except for Harry Potter) But, if you like Science Fiction movies that aren't in outer space, and super weird, you'll probably like it.
0007350031|3.0|Disclosure: I like Michael Crichton stories (usually.) I'm probably giving it an extra star because it feels like a Michael Crichton story. Plot driven by scientific mayhem with barely any character development. Cliff hangers and escapes. It's all in here. What is missing is any introspection by the characters as to whether shrinking humans and machines down to miniature scale is unethical or not. Previous Crichton novels were laden with morality questions. Not so, here, hence my description \\"entertaining fluff.\\"<br /><br />But the real reason I'm writing this review is to quote a passage from the book. The absurdity of it leapt out at me causing laughter accompanied with a groan, and here it is:<br /><br />\\"For a hermit he seems kind of lonely\\", Karen thought.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had heard so much about this book that I just had to read it.  I was very dissappointed.  The story might be interesting if we didn't have to deal with all the trashy, repetitive stuff.  Instead of writing 3 books she should have written only one book with more substance. I'm not a puritan at all, I love hot sexy scenes, but there's a limit to everything. She killed a good idea by over-sexing it.
B0086700CM|4.0|awesome really addictive... deserves a 5 star..I gave 4 stars cos at times it gets slower probably for my system.

The drawings are perfect for any Star Wars fans who is also a father (or a grandfather or even a mother.  My mother and wife loved the book).  The drawings are great and enjoyable from a father-son perspective.  Love this book and would recommend it to anyone.

B0076HMCCO|5.0|High Definition is to Twin Peaks what a great cup of black coffee is to Agent Cooper. Seeing this again in High Definition was like having your best friend from High School come home for a sleep over. You will fall in love with Twin Peaks all over again..<br /><br />I found the entire series at a yard sale on VHS 4 years ago and bought it. I watched it, appreciated and enjoyed the story and dialogue and didn't think too much about it. I'm not sure what made me stream this, but Boy Howdy, I am so glad I did. The cinematography is gorgeous! Story and Dialogue are only part of this wonderful love triangle. David Lynch's brilliance as a director shines complete in the first season. This is visually stunning. Having last seen in on VHS, for me, HD was all the more enchanting, enriching the story with all the eye candy Lynch could find in his actors and spectacular Northwestern landscapes.<br /><br />What a treat it was to see the Twin Peaks logo on the Sheriff's coffee mug, or that the daily special at the Double R was Split Pea and Lamb Stew, or the fact that the delectable Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) had a set of Frank Sinatra baby blue eyes, when broadcast T.V. and VHS had led me to believe they were brown.<br /><br />Beware, if you were ever a smoker, no matter how long it's been, this show will trigger a longing you thought you'd conquered. Not to mention a deep longing for huckleberry pie and a cup of hot black java.<br /><br />Twin Peaks is a dose of double-dipped nostalgia; directly from the 90s, yet the show longs for 50s film noir flair with every sexy breath it takes. Queue it up and enjoy the flannel clad bad boys, the bombshell blondes in saddle shoes, and the quirkiest law enforcement crew since the Andy Griffith show.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|Of all the brilliant, talented female musicians of the 90s - Fiona Apple would not have been the one I'd picked to artistically reign supreme in 2012. But Idler is a masterful LP and Fiona effortlessly takes the crown.<br /><br />I've watched and wept as Tori Amos has gutted her feminism by desperately clinging to her plastic surgery enhanced dolled up closeups. I've held my forehead in shame as Bjork recorded an album on her freaking I-phone, so out of touch she believes embracing elitist technology will keep her vibrant. And I've fallen asleep listening to Ani Difranco sing her ode to Occupy Wall Street.<br /><br />So ya know, really, if I hadn't suffered a romantic disappointment the very same week Fiona Apple (Unidisputed Goddess of the Break-Up Album) released her first album in 7 years, I don't really think I would have had the heart to download this after all the disappointment that's come lately from my posse of favorite females of the 90s<br /><br />Well, Gawd bless relationships that end in disappointment and Fiona Apple for documenting the misery that follows them in all its glory. If you've made it into your 30s, or 40s, perhaps even 50s divorced, never married, or not-otherwise-specified alone, ask yourself this question: Who exactly is singing our song? The formerly mentioned ladies are all confronting wedded bliss (and I wish them all the world's happiness) while the rest of us are marching on, facing the world alone, without a back up choir.<br /><br />This release is enchanting. I found myself tapping my foot, nodding my head, and singing along. Fiona has matured - This album is complete from start to finish. It is a complete work of art, spilling over the edge with creative juice - no room for filler tracks or incomplete thoughts. This is developed, mature, and different than anything else she's put out so far. Yet, it's a natural evolution from where she started. For a seven year absence, there is no anxiety here. Fiona is calm, calculated and serene.<br /><br />\\"I can love the same man in the same bed in the same city<br />But not in the same room, it's a pity, but<br />Oh, it never bothered me before<br />Not 'til this guy, what a guy, oh God what a good guy<br />And I can't even enjoy him<br /><br />And now I'm hard, too hard to know<br />I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no<br />Tears calcify in my tummy<br />Fears coincide with the tow<br /><br />How can I ask anyone to love me<br />When all I do is beg to be left alone? \\"<br /><br />Her skill as pianist is formidable and she finally steps into her own as a competent musical rival to all of her contemporaries. She bends her piano to her will and holds it spellbound. Fiona's strong Jazz roots give this album a distinguished flair you won't find anywhere else in the last or the next decade. She is heart-broken, yet absolutely her own, a complete, and fulfilled human being who can't help but keep rockin' on. Taking the road less traveled has left Fiona to fine tune and craft a passion that her contemporaries traded in for settled stability - This album is riddled with bipolar angst that refuses rest or regret and therefore stays vital, restless and alive.<br /><br />Her trademarked confessional passion is here, but it is no longer a young woman's passion; honest and inspired, Fiona's talent has ripened, and it is so bitter-sweet it will leave you salivating and craving more with spit dripping down your chin.<br /><br />Pure Excellence - Highly recommended!ene.<br /><br />\\"I can love the same man in the same bed in the same city<br />But not in the same room, it's a pity, but<br />Oh, it never bothered me before<br />Not 'til this guy, what a guy, oh God what a good guy<br />And I can't even enjoy him<br /><br />And now I'm hard, too hard to know<br />I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no<br />Tears calcify in my tummy<br />Fears coincide with the tow<br /><br />How can I ask anyone to love me<br />When all I do is beg to be left alone? \\"<br /><br />Her skill as pianist is formidable and she finally steps into her own as a competent musical rival to all of her contemporaries.

B007V5CF5K|1.0|Yes, this game is only a dollar but if the distributor is asked a technical question on why it doesn't function on your Fire, you expect an answer. I have reinstalled it several times with the same bug (the phone in the tutorial does not work). Someone else in these reviews had the same issue. If they had the answer, I would have posted it up for others. As it is, I wasted perfectly good dollar on this.
1936608898|1.0|The minute I opened this book and glanced through the first few pages, I knew I would have a hard time giving credence to these authors or their philosophy and subsequent food plans. The book is so unprofessionally published, right down to the undersized margins that it looks like a cut-and-paste job from the authors' website. Information does not flow smoothly; there are just boxes, continuous one-sentence paragraphs, and anecdotal information stuck between points they want to make. There is virtually no academic reference to actual studies; instead, the studies are \\"alluded to\\" but not referenced. This poor presentation and dismal writing should be a heads up to readers that these authors may be enthusiasts of their theories, but attempting to support their academic claims with \\"scienc-y\\" add-ons should be a red flag to everyone. Ultimately for me, while the information in the book may have worked for many, many believers, the attempt to dumb down and popularize their topic also destroyed any credibility in the theory itself. Their publisher should have valued both the authors themselves and their readers enough to give them a much better written and professionally formatted product.<br />The final insult was the price -- $26 for a $2 book.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|My five and three year old daughters love playing this. They do all the easy levels and then I step in and finish the hard ones. I believe there was one level where the eggs were on the bottom of the bag under the heavier items. You were supposed to fix that before they collapse in on themselves. All in all, a fun game for the entire family. Graphics are cool.
B007CIJT6E|5.0|Love this book. I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and this is one of my favorites- love the easy writing style and interesting characters. Great book!
B00845PV16|1.0|Horrible, terrible movie - Run for your lives!<br /><br />The acting was forced and fake, the cinematography was tactless and unartful, the computer generation was poor, disgraceful, and cheap.  The sound quality (I have an astounding state-of-the-art professional home theater) was inconsistent and frustrating to amend (which was impossible).  As an audiophile I was disgusted with the sound.<br /><br />The PLOT!  The plot was atrocious!  Predictable - and UNIMAGINATIVE.  I've watched predicable movies before (and been tickled by their quirky nuances).  At least the predictable movies had a decent plot.<br /><br />Plot improvements could have been made if scenes and explanations were coordinated, made sense, and helped the viewers to sympathize and give a crap about the protagonists and situations.  There was an extreme focus on action without plausible build up or resolution.<br /><br />A fan of hero movies, I wanted to enjoy this Ghost Rider flick.  Normally my expectations of hero/action movies are low and I find many movies a delight, some which don't always receive the highest reviews.  Even to my standards, I consider this very, very poor.  I rate even Ninja Assassins far above this movie.<br /><br />I rented this movie and I very strongly recommend the following advice: DO NOT BOTHER!  AT ALL!  You will be missing NOTHING and waste precious time which could be better spent watching paint dry or banging your head against a wall for entertainment.  Save yourself and your money.<br />The faults were conspicuous after 10 minutes - good naturedly, I stuck out the movie for 25 minutes.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was reluctant to read this book, for whatever reason I have an issue reading books that have a large popular following. The first chapter or two, or three, were challenging, as there wasn't a lot going on. However, I did connect with the lead female; in many ways, she's me. The book flew by after the first couple of chapters. All sex aside, I enjoyed their banter, the moments between the crazy sex.
B007RE0RR8|1.0|The whole reason we purchased this doll was because of the cute ice cream package she is showed holding. When we received the doll it came with a magazine instead. I'm not happy about the misleading picture. I know it's silly but the ice cream made this so cute that it's why she wanted it.
B004132HZS|5.0|I watched season 2 before season one and was completely hooked. This first one is important for understanding Holmes and Watson' relationship and how they continue to grow in season 2. Fantastic series.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game ever and I played it lots on all my friends iphones and FINALLY it got put in the amazon store. I got it yesterday when I saw it in the top apps and was soliloquy happy!!!!!!! this is my favorite app and everyone should get to play temple run cause it is awesome and addicting. once I got it I could not put it down. it is challenging and exciting and fun and I love it so much! GET THIS APP.....PLEASE!!!!!!!!  It rocks!!!!!!!!!!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Fantastic series - have watched repeatedly and shared with others. I wish American television was this good - maybe I would watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Don't have a lot of time to read but I made time for this. Enjoyed all three books so much that I have read them twice.
0345803493|1.0|This book down the toilet. At least that's what I think when someone writes..flushing or flushes. This book was not any better than the first one. I stopped reading around the marriage proposal. I don't think I will be finishing this series. I don't understand the positive reviews on this book or book #1. I love the negative reviewers posts on this book, as to the kindle count for certain words in the book. My fault in purchasing the series, yes I bought all 3, was not checking the reviews here on Amazon prior to my purchase. I wouldn't have bought it. The only redeeming quality of this author's is selling the rights. Maybe Hollywood will get the book completely wrong and make an awesome movie. For those who want exact reasons why I don't like this series here ya go: writing was terrible, someone needs a thesaurus, the repetitive words, no plot, the heroine is way to whiny, and the hero is blah.
B000S54P4O|1.0|***Updated***<br />Noise.  This album is just noise.  Slow, experimental, instrumental, dissonant, plodding, moody noise.  Setting your noise in a minor key doesn't make it deep.  Congratulations, album.  You have the most \\"thumbs-down\\" ratings of any album in my music collection.<br /><br />Purchased this album after hearing about this band on NPR's Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me.  The prevalence of 5 star reviews are a mystery to me.  Angry that I wasted $10 on this album.
B005LAIGWS|2.0|If you saw the first one and liked it, give this a shot. If you thought it was stupid, this one will not surprise you in any way. It was real dumb. The plot was real dumb. The acting was real crappy and the special effects were pretty good. Actually, I didn't try this, but I bet if you watched it on mute it would actually be cooler than with sound. It looked cool. But it wasn't cool. The story had so many holes in it you could barely see the cheese. It was like those old horror movies where everyone in the movie is so stupid like they've never had to use common sense a day in their lives. \\"All my friends are being heinously murdered? Let's go see what's down in the cellar! Doop dee doop dee doo AHHHHHHHRRRGGHHHHH!!!!\\" Yeah, that kind of complete idiocy was rampant in this film. Let's not worry about HOW anything is happening here, lets just focus more on having a big flaming head look at the camera kinda sidewaysey a bunch and run to the bank...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this app is awesome! and very helpfull. it totally works on the kindle fire! because it says its for the Android.  but not true. so to all the bad reviews what's your point?!
B007MDB71O|5.0|If you don't already know by now, never listen to film critics. This movie is a perfect example of how critics are totally full of it. The only thing to criticise about this movie is how absolutely horribly Disney failed to market this film. If the critics were judging this soley on how well it was marketed, then the terrible ratings make sense. I didn't want to see this movie based on everything I'd seen from pre-marketing. It looked retarded. I finally rented it just out of curiosity and was completely blown away. The acting was top notch, the special effects were amazing, and the story was fantastic. It immediately made me want to watch a sequel, so I went online only to find that Disney botched the marketing so badly that they actually scrapped plans for a sequel because it didn't make enough money! Of course it didn't make money, they made it look ridiculous in everything they said about it. It's a serious sci-fi movie that they marketed as some kind of kids show. The only reason it got a pg-13 rating is because all the people on Mars bled blue blood when they were eviscerated and hacked to pieces. If it had been red this would have had a hard R rating. It was extremely violent and had many adult themes that would not only not appeal to kids, but it would piss off any parents who took thier kids to see it. Disney's marketing department is run by morons. Unfortunatley that may have ruined what could have been one of the greatest sci-fi franchises EVER. Don't listen to critics, and don't listen to Disney. Just watch this movie and enjoy!
B00785P2QC|4.0|A lot easier to play than Sim City, and very visually appealing. Impossible to get by without spending money, and for that reason only four Stars.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|I've been a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins since Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness was created.  The album featured everything I fell in love with the Pumpkins from heavy-hitters (\\"Ode To No One\\", \\"XYU\\"), to epic anthems (\\"Thru The Eyes of Ruby\\", \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\\"), to sing-a-long rockers (\\"Here Is No Why\\", \\"Muzzle\\"), to acoustic numbers (\\"The Arms of Sleep\\"), and artsy tracks (\\"Cupid De Locke\\", \\"We Only Come Out At Night\\").  To me, that album will always be their masterpiece as it is one of the best rock albums created.  Siamese Dream and Gish are excellent classic albums as well.  I wasn't too keen on any of their later albums, but I've learned to appreciate the softer Adore and electronic Machina over time.  When Smashing Pumpkins came back into the music scene with Zeitgeist, I was pleased but somewhat disappointed.  The album featured some songs with the sound that you'd expect off of their earlier albums like the pummeling \\"Tarantula\\" and the rocking opener \\"Doomsday Clock\\".  However, the album lacked the spark and flare the Pumpkins had prior to their break up which may have been the reason for mixed reviews.  With the anticipation of Oceania, what should you expect?  Well, it starts off with the most rocking track on the album \\"Quasar\\" which kind of takes you on a trip back to the Gish era.  A fine opener it is, however, Corgan's vocals seem a little monotone.  Nonetheless, the energy of the music makes up for them.  \\"Panopticon\\" soars with an anthem-like chorus that will remind you of Siamese Dream tracks \\"Hummer\\" or \\"Rocket\\".  The album continues to be a great listen with the two best tracks on the album \\"The Celestials\\" which starts off soft but turns into a memorable up-beat rocker, and \\"Violet Rays\\" which is a melodic rock track that actually features some of Billy's best vocals on the album or maybe the best since their comeback.  The song could have easily fit on one of their earlier records.  \\"My Love Is Winter\\" continues as a melodicrocker that wouldn't be bad to release as a single if they were to decide to go that route.  However, after these first 5 songs, the album kind of takes a wrong turn.  \\"Pinwheels\\" features a mesmerizing intro that feels too long.  It almost sounds like it could be off of a Nintendo or Sega Genesis video game.  When I first heard the 30 second clip for \\"Oceania\\", I thought that it would be epic.  It turns out that I can barely make it through the song.  The first half is good but then in the middle it sounds like a completely different song.  This has worked well with past works like the acoustic break in \\"Behold! The Nightmare!\\" from Adore but not here.  It just makes the song too choppy and out of focus.  I know it's 9 minutes long but it seemed much longer.  \\"Pale Horse\\" is a snoozer for me.  When I first read the track list and saw the title \\"The Chimera\\", I thought that it had to be a heavy hitter.  Well, it indeed is a rocker but a poppier one.  It's not bad but it sounds TOO MUCH like Zwan than Smashing Pumpkins.  I enjoyed Zwan's record for what it was but not for a Pumpkins album.  \\"Glissandra\\" picks things up a bit and is easily one of the best songs on the album with it's catchy guitar riffs and glossy production.  \\"Inkless\\", like \\"The Chimera\\", sounds too happy sounding and too much like Zwan to be on a Pumpkin's record.  The lyrics are rather dull, \\"the stars are out tonight...\\".  So yes, Oceania has it's perks but has it's downfalls.  I know you can't live in the past but it would be cool to hear some heavy rockers like \\"Geek USA\\" or \\"Jellybelly\\" again.  That is one flaw.  The other flaw is just that Billy's vocals are not the same as they were before.  They aren't lifeless or passionless (\\"Violet Rays\\" is an example of good vocals) like they were on the majority of Zeitgeist but they just lack the angst and intensity that was present on their albums prior to Zwan.  However, I do recommend Pumpkins fans give this a listen.  Does it live up to Mellon Collie, Siamese Dream, or Gish?  NO WAY.  But, is it worthy for being a fine Smashing Pumpkins release?  Absolutely.<br /><br />Standout tracks:<br />Quasar<br />Panopticon<br />The Celestials<br />Violet Rays<br />My Love Is Winter<br />Glissandra
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been a fan of Rush for 35 + years. It brings a sense of rightness and comfort when I listen to this album. They evolve and grow musically as I grow in years. Rush has been, is and always will be the soundtrack of my life. Even in the Autumn of my life, a child like wonder and fascination swells when I hear their music...it all comes flooding back. I will tend that Garden I promise.

006197806X|5.0|Pandemonium is the follow-up novel to Delirium. This sequel knocks it out of the park! The story once again centers on Lena, a teenage girl living in a world split in two- the world that has taken love out of the equation and the Wilds, the bombed out shell of the US that those who have chosen love over all else. Pandemonium goes deeper into Lena and her world. She is no longer following society, blindly accepting her fate of a loveless life. She has made it to the Wilds and is now struggling to survive as the \\"new Lena\\".<br /><br />The story jumps back and forth between \\"then\\" and \\"now\\", telling the story of Lena when she first came to the Wilds and the ongoing story of Lena and the Resistance. Lena must learn to cope with the loss of Alex, who she fell in love with in Delirium. In the \\"now\\", she has been integrated into society once again and is working for the Resistance from the inside. Lena shows much more depth as a character in this book- not only has she learned about love, but also about hate and how it is just as strong a force as love.<br /><br />Parts of the story were, yes, predictable, but there were for sure moments of \\"wow, didn't see that coming!\\" and the ending was such a cliff-hanger, I cannot wait for the third installment!<br /><br />Well written, lots more depth to Lena as a character, a solid read!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The friend who introduced this book to me said, \\"You might not like it, but you'll never forget it.\\"  So true.<br /><br />I did like it.  A lot.  I just finished reading it for the second time, in fact.  And no, I don't think I'll ever forget it.<br /><br />The writing's good.  The premises (the surface ones and the deeper ones) are all fascinating.  The animal and zoo-keeping facts enthralled me.  It was exciting, brutal, and most of all thought-provoking.<br /><br />And I still don't know which story to believe, or what exactly that means about me.<br /><br />Read it.  It's not something that will let go of you once you turn the last page.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Growing up in the '90s, I've always been familiar with the Pumpkins. However, I began listening to them very consistently this last year and they quickly became one of my favorite bands. Their first three albums are quite brilliant, especially for the time they were released. Though Billy Corgan was ahead of his time and created music quite unlike anything else, there remains a divide among Pumpkins fans with some feeling that Billy is a musical tyrant who wronged the other band members- D'arcy, James, and Jimmy by continuing to perform with the name \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" in their absence. Yes, I liked the old line up, but what some fans don't seem to realize is that BILLY CORGAN IS THE SMASHING PUMPKINS! He wrote all the band's music and is responsible for their unique sound. James and D'arcy were good, but Billy could play guitar and bass better than both of them. In fact, Billy had to play and record all the bass and guitar parts on Gish and Siamese Dream- because he was that much better and could do it much faster than the others. I'll say that Jimmy is a hell of a drummer, but without Corgan, The Smashing Pumpkins would simply not be The Smashing Pumpkins.<br /><br />The recording of Oceania was a band effort, and Billy wrote all the music again. However, this album signals a return to the Pumpkins initial sound, without sounding like a rip off of their previous successes. I would say that if you like the psychedelic and sonic atmospheric landscapes found in Gish and Siamese Dream, Oceania is definitely for you. Upon first listen, I noted Oceania has all the classic characteristics of a Pumpkin album- layered guitars with sonic depth, beautiful string arrangements, and melodic guitar riffs that synch so well with the dreamy atmosphere only the Pumpkins can create. Billy claims that this is his best effort since 1995's Mellon Collie, and I fully agree with that statement.<br /><br />I really enjoy all the songs, but here are a few highlights from Oceania. \\"Quasar\\"is the opening track and it's a heavy-rocking shoegaze tune that provides a great starting point for the album. The second song, \\"Panopticon,\\" has a killer guitar riff with pounding drums in the background. The next few songs such as \\"The Celestials\\" and \\"Violet Rays\\" are slower melodies, but are still great songs. One song that really stands out is \\"Pinwheels,\\" which begins with a synth intro that is remniscient of the Adore sound, but much more uplifting and also has some acoustic guitar. \\"Oceania\\" is a somewhat mellow, progressive masterpiece. \\"The Chimera\\" is a hard rock song that reminds me of the sound from Siamese Dream. The album finishes on a softer note, with the song \\"Wildflower.\\" Altogther, this album is a must buy for any Pumpkin fan. Billy Corgan has proved to everyone he still has it, and hopefully, Oceania gets the attention it deserves. In closing, Oceania can stand on its own and should not be compared to the masterpieces of Gish, Siamese Dream, or Mellon Collie, but appreciated for what it is- a sign that Bily Corgan has- and is still fully capable of producing beautiful, unique music.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I was not a huge NJ fan before this album.  I watched a video of her singing the songs at a small concert and really liked what I heard.  A little more of a rock sound, and less easy listening.  I think she is a great talent and like that she gave this a try.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Pretty much does the same things my phone can do.  Definetly would not pay for this, especially at $5....free may be to much!
B00846REIS|3.0|This book is practically a copy of 50 Shades.  Yes, the names of the characters are different, and here we are dealing with a bunch of troubled kids as opposed to just the one disturbed character that is Christian Grey, but still... the books are just too similar.  While reading it, I could not help but feel I had already experienced this love story.  He removes her makeup just like Grey does in one of the 50 shades books, he falls in love with her the moment he sees her; he wants to dominate her; she does not want to be dominated;  he is billionaire in his twenties; he owns every establishment they set a foot in, and on and on.<br /><br />Was the book entertaining? Yes.  Does it get better toward the end?  Yes.  Is it better written than 50? YES!  Nonetheless, I would have preferred to read something \\"new\\" and not a re-make of 50 shades.  I hope the 50-shades hype does not mean that every romance-erotica novel out there will now become an adaptation of the same book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It kept my interest and now I am on the third book in less then a week.  It is the best series since Twilight.
0156012197|5.0|An excellent tale of a boy who grows up to be a mature, respobsible, and ultimately boring adult. After crash landing his plane in the desert, he meets the little prince who ignites something in him and recalls to him the joys of childlike wonder. Recommended to me by a very close intellectual who is my greatest friend. I would highly recommend it to anyone who knows what its like to miss the child like wonder and intelligence associated with simplicity  and who dispizes the idiocracy associated with flawed \\"grown up\\" ideaology. It is inspiring to read and can be read multiple times with something new learned every time. An easy read with great application. I will definitely have this book in my collection for the rest of my life.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|This is my first COLDPLAY album purchase.  I've been a fan of their music for some time now, but never bought a full album.  Some people feel this is too \\"pop\\" sounding, but to me it does not.  It much better than any pop music playing right now on the radio (w/ a few exceptions).  The lyrics are tastefull and some are hauntingly beautiful.  I recommend this album especially if you've never listened to any COLDPLAY album from start to finish.
B0086700CM|5.0|the speed gets faster and it gets annoying at times but it gives a good challenge especially with the gorilla monkey things
B004EJUMT2|5.0|I see why just about everyone in metal loves this band. The album is awesome from the first song to the last and everyone in between. Once I saw these guys live earlier this year and can only say, wow, just wow!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|but I was hooked once I started watching Downton Abbey.  You'll love the characters, the acting, the writing, the costumes, the sets.  Besides those of us who are anglophiles, I think it speaks to us in 2011-2012 because we can see where we came from socio-economically and yet somehow long for that simpler time.

B002SQ3664|5.0|Whether it's Brokeback Mountain or Taking Woodstock, Ang Lee has a knack for letting the story tell itself.  It's funny, touching, lovely, wistful and really captures the coming of age of a generation on their way to wherever they are going against the backdrop of a generation coming to terms with the arcing of their own timelines.  It's hard to explain but at least rent this movie and see how it moves you.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|when you first open it'll notify you that it has been updated to a recent version. it has great features and runs smoothly on my kindle fire. lots of functionality to it I'm quite pleased.
0345803485|4.0|This isn't a book that requires much thought.  It got me through a day shut inside with the a/c because it was 100 in June.  Better than the books that insipired the author to write in the first place.  If you're looking for an engrossing read to while the day away, this will work.  That's my short review.<br /><br />But it's rare that I don't think about a book so...<br /><br />When I start thinking well, I've read this book before.  Young virgin who meets a domineering man that teaches her about sex, only this domineering man is a Dominant.  Trouble is, the author is clearly not comfortable with the world she is writing about.  Why do I say that?  First, she made Christian's desire for \\"strawberry\\" the result of abuse in his formative years.  It's like she's asking vanilla readers to forgive her for talking about kinky sex because her hero is damaged and that's why he's into it.  Why not just write a guy who likes to be a Dominant w/o the excuse for it?  Or really turn the genre on its ear and write about a guy who is submissive (would the male publishing world even allow that?).  Then with Christian's overly long contract and Ana's fears, she immediately took everything off the table except for bondage and spanking.  I'm not saying she had to go hardcore, that's not fun to read, but how many times can I read about someone being tied up and hit with something?  She should have done research with Ana and added in other stuff.  There is more to BDSM that could have been explored (read the Kushiel's Dart series and you'll see).<br /><br />But repetition is the word for these books.  Every other paragraph has \\"holy\\" something in it.  Holy cow is used so much that all I can think of is Seinfeld where George's key chain that says holy cow gets paved in the road and says \\"holy cow\\" over and over as cars drive over it.  Then there is that Christina is always running his nose over parts of Ana.  Ok once, but he does it every time they have sex.  Again, get a new schtick.  Ana's constant requests to touch him (how many times can the guy say no), know about his past and demand info about Mrs. Robinson are so annoying I was yelling at her to shut up.  Does she have to badger the guy every page?  Back off chick.  By the time she started mouthing off about a lifestyle she clearly didn't understand and making judgments about Christian's past with Mrs. R I pretty much had my fill of her.  Time for the gag, wait, that was taken off the table too.<br /><br />The book is bizarrely behind on technology.  I thought it was supposed to be set in the early 2000s until Christian mentioned Kings of Leon.  What college student today doesn't have their own computer?  It's pretty much a requirement.  Who uses \\"the latest version of an iMac\\"?  I haven't heard about one of those since they had those colorful ones in the late 1990s.  If you're filthy rich and using Apples, you're using an iBook air.  And you aren't buying your g/f a Blackberry, you get her an iphone.  But then, what phone made today doesn't support texting?  Ana might not pay for texting on her old phone, but a 22 year old will have a phone and it will have texting capabilities.<br /><br />As for the Tess of the D'urbervilles obsession (I assume to rival Twilight's obsession with a classic book each novel), well, being compared to Tess isn't much of a compliment.  Depending on how you interpret the book (it was written in the days when it was the woman's fault if a man attacked her so it's a bit unclear what the inference of a \\"guardian angel looking aside\\" is meant to imply), Tess is either seduced or raped by a guy believed to be her distant cousin (his family actually stole the D'urberville name and wealth generations ago) and gets pregnant.  The baby dies and Tess moves on with her life, meeting Angel who looooooooooves her until she confesses to him on their wedding night that she's not a virgin.  Even though he's not a virgin and she was potentially raped, he tosses her aside like trash and walks out.  When he finally forgives her and gets over some mystery illness he finds she moved in with her former lover/attacker because Tess feels that's all she's good for.  Tess kills the guy and runs off with Angel who tries to hide her from the police, but never fear, when the cops find them, Tess goes with them and goes to the gallows.  But not before she urges Angel to marry her pure sister and he does.<br /><br />Is that really a woman a modern young woman would identify with or want to liken her relationship to?  I guess the author didn't undestand Tess any better than she understood BDSM.<br /><br />Taking it as a light summer read, I'll move on to the next book, but I fear the goal is to \\"cure\\" Chrisitian  of his strawberry tastes instead of having him and Ana reach a true dom/sub understanding where she trusts that he'll never ask her for more than she can handle and he trusts that she'll never let him go too far.ash and walks out.

B005KELQEU|5.0|I got this through the Amazon Warehouse deals for 8.40 . It was probably a return from a Kindle TOUCH owner (read reviews how it does not fit)  There is 1/8 inch width play but NO play at all in the length.  The Kindle TOUCH is 6.8 inch Length,  and the KINDLE (79 with special offers...Advertisements) is 6.5 inch Length.  3/10 ths. of an inch.  Critical!!  IT WILL NOT FIT THE TOUCH , unless the case that I have is simply made too small because the qualiaty control in terms of the dimensions are weak.  Some who have the touch say it fits fine.  Therefore, the issue must be qualiaty control. I doubt the Kindles are of varying size. Nevertheless,  The case for 8 and change is great!!!<br /><br />Belkin....address this issue !

B007J4T2G8|5.0|We enjoyed this book enormously.  I am surprised that a number of people did not like it because it is not realistic (a pack of improbable lies).  I recommend to them to read Marcel Proust,  Remembrance of Things Past.  That is a good book and does not have an invented incident in it but characters are disguised.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|So pleased today to have Amazon replace my charging cord for my kindle \\"for free\\".  About a month ago I noticed a crack or two on my Kindle cord.  I thought I had damaged it somehow. Every time I got the cord out over the month more and more of the outside coating was cracking.  Today when I got it out to use it, chunks of the coating were falling off.  I searched the internet to see if others had the same issue - I found they did.  I called Amazon and they have replaced it.  Go Amazon!  I use Amazon for everything now-a-days.  I couldn't be happier with the service. Amazon never disappoints!

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Simply put, thematically this is another take on 2112 -- a struggle with faith and against control. Why else would the clock on the cover read 21:12? Musically? Wow. That's all I have to say.

B0026PW67W|5.0|I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan and so I was looking online for some HP stuff. I was trying to find things from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, but cheaper, to save money. I saw this and kept debating whether or not to get it, because it was a little expensive. I decided to get it and I was SOOO glad! I showed someone the picture of it and she said that it was the same one at the WWOHP, which sells for $50! When I got it I immediately opened it up and started exploring all of the passageways and writing. I love the little notes and fold-outs. It is REALLY big. The paper is thick and heavy, and it looks like worn parchment. People are saying that it doesn't have the houses, but I didn't really care, there's so much other stuff! Overall, it is a great product, and probably won't wear out anytime soon.

0312944098|4.0|The characters and plot of Mr. Archer's \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" are somewhat predictable. The story took about a hundred pages before the thing got my undivided attention. It would take a pretty dimwitted individual not to quickly realize that Danny Cartwright is going to get the girl, his revenge and be swimming in loot by the end of the story. The good guys are good. The bad guys are bad. Danny's and Beth's love for each other is unbreakable. Yadda. Yadda. Yadda. That's okay because besides the author being a very good storyteller, he does sprinkle in enough tiny mysteries and plot twists to keep the reader engaged. I especially enjoyed that Mr. Archer makes Danny's ascent and revenge due not only to his abilities but also because other key characters believed he got a raw deal and were at his disposal. There was also one nasty piece of work named Kevin Leach who I wished had had an even larger role in the book. \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" isn't great literature, but so what. It's simply a fun, summer read. That'll do just fine for me.
B00899DR40|4.0|I like all types of music and I don't really like labels.  If I like it I listen to it.  This is a more grown up album complete with some romantic sweet songs, some edgy songs - It's just fun to listen to and makes me smile.
B0053KWDES|1.0|I am sending mine back for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />The first one is that the static noise heard when the amp is located close to my iphone. No static is heard when I place them apart from each other, but obviously the whole point to having a pocket amp is to be able to have both in the same pocket...<br /><br />Second is that I have very high end earphones (Westone ES5) and for these, the amp doesn't add any value whatsoever compared to the iphone internal amp. My guess is that it's due to the very sensitivity of the earphones, meaning it doesn't take much power to drive them, and the iphone amp is doing a fine job at that.

006197806X|5.0|I think we all have been in this situation where you wanna cry and shout and lie down to bed after reading a book. Okay, not just a book, but a really good book. This is what happened to me the time I reached the final page of Pandemonium. I can't explain the feeling. Maybe it was a mixture of things. The feeling where you don't understand whether you are sad or happy or hopeless or the opposite. And the only easy escape is to have the next book. But no way you can have it now because you still have to wait a couple of months or a year to have it. Then it hits you... frustration and torture. Honestly, I don't think I could write it down well. So let me just say that I totally loved Pandemonium, I enjoyed it so much. It is really good. It surpassed my high expectations.<br /><br />What I love about this book?<br /><br />The Deliria. Love.<br /><br />Even Delirium impressed me so much by tackling this idea that \\"love\\" is a disease. It was amazing to see how terrified people are when they learned that you are infected... by love. And then you'll be persecuted because you feel it--love. In Pandemonium, it surprises me even more by how the plot and the setting changed. War. Chaos. Everywhere. I met a whole bunch of characters and each of them has their own story to tell. I felt sad for them. I pitied them. This book is action-packed, you won't get bored. Lots of twists and surprises that will keep you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Lena.<br /><br />She had grown so much from that innocent girl in Delirium to a fighter in Pandemonium. When the rest of the world seemed to be hardened by loss and grief, Lena remains human, strong and smart. It's nice to see that she still cries, and she still have a soft spot within her, but she's never numb. She knows what she wants and I liked her for that.<br /><br />Julian.<br /><br />What can I say? It was a surprise to me because I didn't see it coming. I thought it was this another guy from the Wilds. I missed Alex from the beginning, and I admit that throughout the book, I'm not sure what to believe in. I believed and/or almost believed that maybe he's really dead. (You have to read it, to find out. ) And Julian is the new guy. I loved Alex from Delirium but I can't resist loving Julian in Pandemonium. Both guys are great. I didn't know who I liked better for Lena. But then, Alex might or might not be dead.<br /><br />Alex.<br /><br />When I finished the book, I couldn't stop thinking about what really happened. I missed Alex the whole time in the book but Julian filled that hole in my heart. But then I guess, it couldn't be filled at all. Because when I closed the book, I grabbed Delirium from my shelf, and skimmed through the pages where I can read about Alex again. I don't want to say anything more, because I don't want to spoil the book for you. I'm afraid that I'm giving away too much already.<br /><br />This book made me shiver. It seemed like Lena's emotions poured into me like a bucket of cold water. (Or maybe I should lessen my coffee intake.) Felt like I was shaking, I could hardly stand. I read the last page over and over again. The big cliffy ending almost killed me. This book is so so good, I totally loved it. I couldn't stop thinking about it and this feeling is weighing me down. I don't think I will sleep well tonight.<br /><br />Deliria is infectious. Want to know what it feels like? Do I recommend it? My goodness, yes. After a roller coaster ride kind of feeling? After almost being killed by a big cliffy ending? Who am I not to share the torture?<br /><br />Just read it. It's worthy of your time.<br /><br />Requiem,<br /><br />Please be out now.inning, and I admit that throughout the book, I'm not sure what to believe in.

0345803485|1.0|First of all this was the absolute worst book I have ever read.  It appears that to be a best selling artist all you have to do is repeatedly write the same exact phrase.  From biting her lip, to her inner goddess, murmuring and mumbling...I was appalled that this actually has people praising this book.  It really is irritating to find out that this book was published, along with 2 others, when millions of people are aspiring to be authors and they're getting nowhere.  I am here to try to get you to save your money, because this piece of garbage is NOT worth it.
0571238343|5.0|I am currently in Media Arts and Animation and I bought this book to help me understand the whole process. It is very informative and easy to understand. I love the illustrations since I not only like written instruction but I am also a visual learner. The instructions were well written and took into account the beginner in animation.Excellent book if you are considering this field or even if you just want to learn how to create good animation.
0439023521|4.0|I saw the movie and liked it so much I bought the book! I was very pleasantly surprised at how well the movie captured the essence of the book's plot and characters.  The book is easy to read and kept my attention page after page after page!  It has lots of action and conflict and is thankfully not overly graphic. The author did a wonderful job of developing the personalities of the main characters and making the story's premise credible.  I highly recommend it and am looking forward to reading the second book in the series.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Very good app! I use it on my Kindle Fire and it is just amazing! I got it because you cannot access the vevo videos off of youtube on the regular internet because they are not in a moblie format, so I would deffinately suggest this!! I would give it 1,000 stars if I could!!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I had fairly low expectations for this film, but it far exceeded my expectations. The story is complex - you have to pay attention to what the characters are saying, but I saw it with small children who had no trouble following along. If you're going to see a mindless action film, this movie is not for you. It asks you to think, and to consider the characters' positions and feelings, and to buy into the ideas it presents. It is bold, exciting and intelligent and it takes no prisoners. It is easily the best science fiction film made in the last ten years, and though Disney threw it under a bus so badly that it will likely never have a sequel, I hope it becomes the cult classic it so richly deserves to be.<br /><br />The cast is fantastic and rock-solid. Taylor Kitsch is honestly not the John Carter I envisioned when I read the novels as a child, but he brings an internalized anti-hero depth to the character that won me over very early on. His acting style serves as a contrast to the many classically trained actors in the supporting cast. He really is a stranger in a strange land, and though the script didn't always give him much nuance to work with, he brought it anyway. More than that, the physicality and athleticism that he brought to the role is really incredible to behold; I can think of few actors around right now who could have done it justice. There are several truly incredible action sequences in which I understand Kitsch did all his own stunts, and it's authentic to a degree I haven't seen in action films in years. Dejah Thoris is not the warrior princess from the (horrible) trailers, but she is a brilliant, passionate and fearless female character who does not let John Carter off the hook. He doesn't fall for her because she's pretty arm candy; he forms a connection to her because of her devotion to her people and her intelligence. That's not a story you see every day. The supporting characters are all pitch-perfect if you're a fan of the books (particularly Sola and the rest of the Tharks, of whom I would've loved to have seen more.)<br /><br />And the SFX! This is one of the most expensive films ever made, and it shows. You see every penny on the screen; this movie LOOKS amazing and its visual effects are a feast for the eyes. I highly recommend watching this in HD, on Blu-Ray if possible, on the biggest screen you can find, because the shots of Helium and Mars literally took my breath away. The scene where he learns to walk on Mars gave me chills. There is not one pixel that doesn't look completely believable. This is a world that you can completely suspend your disbelief for and get lost in. I would have happily watched two more hours of the Tharks or Helium's society alone.<br /><br />The script will upset purists, because it is an adaptation. I loved the novels as a child, but I understand that this is an adaptation and that Andrew Stanton filled in some storytelling gaps from the original pulp stories. They really worked for me, particularly the ending that left me smiling. I saw it twice in the theaters, and twice the audience applauded over the closing credits, something I've never seen happen before. If you're a fan of space adventures, and earnest science-fiction films that are just plain fun, you'll like this. Authentic science fiction isn't for everyone, especially ones that invite you to think and invest in a fictional world, but for those of us who love that, this film is an absolute gem.y Sola and the rest of the Tharks, of whom I would've loved to have seen more.)<br /><br />And the SFX!

B000SGSU58|5.0|If you like Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch, this may be the best book I have read with Harry in it.  Why?  Fast-paced, Harry's future is on the line, intense storyline, creative plot twists, fascinating trial scenes with parallel detection and investigation moving forward. There's on the edge of your seat scenes. Liked Harry in it, like his new girlfriend. Everything is done well in this book. Great secondary characters, too. Don't start this book if you have other commitments.  Save it for when you can read it in a couple of days.  It's fairly riveting. The only drawback for me was detailing of the sex trade--somewhat graphic crime descriptions. But the book is superbly plotted and executed.  It will make you want to read another Harry Bosch book when you finish this one. I just ordered THE DROP.
B004LWZW2E|4.0|Insidious is an independent horror film from director James Wan; one of my personal favorite directors who also directed Saw and Death Sentence. Insidious is slightly different from other haunted house films because it's not the house that's haunted. It's not a big change to the genre, but at least it attempts to create something different. Insidious mixes tension with jump-out scares. When I originally watched it in theaters (with mixed expectations because of the Paranormal Activity marketing and James Wan directing), most of the scares were original and unexpected so I left satisfied. The first two acts of the film are terrifying and amazing. I have mixed feelings about the last act when they enter what is called \\"The Further\\". Although it changes the pace of the film and isn't as scary as the first half, it's still manages to be creepy. Consequently, I enjoyed the film overall. The acting was fine, the music was great, and the scares were often original and creative.<br /><br />Insidious is an amazing horror film worth watching with an open mind. Go in with low expectations, and you'll possibly leave surprised. I highly recommend watching Insidious. If you have to buy it or stream it on Netflix, it's definitely worth your time!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|There's not a doubt in my mind it's the greatest album I've ever listened to. At this point I would literally buy any piece of music these guys are selling. Their next album I will buy sight unseen without a second thought. I will be thrilled if it is even half as good as this one.
B00845PT18|1.0|I have no words to describe how truly bad this film and Nicolas Cage were....not to mention the other has been and no name actors in this flop.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Well I just got back from the midnight showing of this film and I have to admit that I think they did a pretty good adaptation from the novel, [[ASIN:0446563072 Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]] by Seth Grahame-Smith, although admittedly there was quite a bit left out and a few minor changes were quite apparent. The primary reason why you should never read the book before seeing the movie, you will almost always end up being disappointed in the big screen adaption. However, I must admit that this may very well not be the case in this particular instance. Your main cast of characters include Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln, whom you may recall seeing in the movie, [[ASIN:B000M4RG42 Flags of Our Fathers]] directed by Clint Eastwood. I kept watching his character and trying to place him but just couldn't until I realized that the reason he looks so familiar is that he could pass for a young Liam Neeson or perhaps even an older son. Rufus Sewell plays the vampire villain, Adam with a fiendishly clever and quite believable style that makes him a very despicable villain, one of his many roles that you might recall was the pompous knight in, [[ASIN:B00000F4ZY A Knight's Tale]] along side the late Heath Ledger, or perhaps as the evil crown prince in the very well done and quite intriguing movie, [[ASIN:B000K7VHQ4 The Illusionist]], which also starred Edward Norton in perhaps one of his best performances to date. Rounding out the cast is Dominic Cooper as Abraham's confidant and vampire hunter/killer trainer; Henry, Anthony Mackie as Abraham's boyhood friend Will, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Abraham's love interest and eventual wife, Mary Todd.<br /><br />The movie starts out with Abraham as a young boy and tells the story of his upbringing and rise to prominence as perhaps the most beloved of all our Presidents, while also being the one man who not only brought this great nation together as one after being divided for so long with brother fighting against brother during the Civil War, but also as our savior as a nation of free living men instead of a nation of vampires. Which as you will come to find out in the movie, actually fought against the Union by taking sides with the Confederacy.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed with the way the movie, for the most part, tried to blend historical fact with vampirical fantasy to make for a very entertaining movie. It almost, and I do mean almost, makes you wonder if perhaps just maybe it might have been possible. Okay, nobody really believes that, but suspend believe for awhile and simply enjoy the telling of an alternate reality. I really didn't have any complaints with the movie because we are working from a fantastical point of reference and not one based entirely on historical accuracy. I did however really enjoy the fact that in the movie Abraham chooses to dispatch his undead foes with the blade of a very well balanced axe instead of a variety of firearms that he had been offered. When Abraham starts swinging that axe around in a quite unique and very precise manner, you will really become quite anxious waiting for him to start hacking his way through the undead hordes. And you won't have to wait for very long before he does.<br /><br />The ending of the movie was also very well done and without spoiling it for anyone, I was left feeling just a bit unfulfilled as I had envisioned a bit different or perhaps I should say a more final, yet unique ending to go with the existing story. But having said that, you will not be disappointed in this movie at all.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Movie Aficionado<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.ng the Civil War, but also as our savior as a nation of free living men instead of a nation of vampires.

B007D2XSW0|1.0|First of all why would they put a camera app in the kindle fire appstore? The fire doesnt even have a camera! The only thing you can do is take pictures from your gallery to decorate. Plus when i turned it on it froze! i tried to get to the home page but nothing worked. I  finally had to restart my kindle. but when i restarted the kindle the app was still on the screen! i had to call the kindle fire customer service so they could fix it. but they charged me 50 DOLLARS!!! this app can ruin your kindle so beware! unless you have money to blow do not get this app!!?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It is depressing that this is a best seller. It is absolute crap writing. It is rare that I don't want to read more than one book in a trilogy - but this was more than enough. I absolutely have no interest in what happens to these vapid, inarticulate and horny characters.
B006G7YBT2|4.0|Boone Daniels is a surfer who works, as often as circumstances demand, as a private investigator. There are just enough dangling threads from a previous novel to suggest that Daniels' reluctance to engage in his vocation is only half an outward expression of his surfer ethos. The other half is composed of a reasonable aversion to life-threatening situations met with a reluctance to confront the throng of deceptions and little failures that make up the world outside of his carefully arranged paradise out on the waves.<br /><br />But, as the book opens, the surf is anything but up. Boone's ex-girlfriend, Sunny, has left for a well-deserved ride as a career surfer. The old rules that have governed the scene since The Dawn Patrol, his rag-tag band of loveable badasses, first arrived have begun to erode. The recent murder of a much-beloved local icon by a young surf punk has everyone, including Boone, questioning the foundations of their shared life and experiences on the beaches of San Diego.<br /><br />For those whose awareness of the surfer culture begins with the Beach Boys and hasn't been refreshed since Pointbreak, The Gentlemen's Hour is a thoughtful reboot. Its cultural memory stretches back to the second World War and gently guides the reader to the modern day where Buddhist ethics, turf wars, ecological turmoil, mixed martial arts and white supremacy rest uneasily side-by-side.<br /><br />Like the waves it often turns to for metaphor, the story relishes in hiding beneath the surface, slowly building power until neither reader nor protagonist can hope to escape its momentum and must decide whether to ride or bail as it careens towards a crashing finish. As coyly as he pieces it together, it is impossible not to see the process aspects of the story being assembled as Winslow sketches out Boone's persona - a reluctant PI forced into his current role by a blown case in his previous life as a policeman that continues to haunt him.<br /><br />Winslow's understandingof his characters' motivations and how they shape the action that unfolds rings true throughout. The rich plot is unlocked one layer at a time by people making difficult but understandable decisions that add flesh with each twist to the skeletal archetypes they inhabit at its beginning. It is a rare moment in the book when the author is forced into lengthy exposition to make you understand someone.<br /><br />Dialogue exchanges, especially between surfers, is often reduced to monosyllabic grunts hard-coded with intricate meanings that must be unpacked through context. While the lingo sits a bit silly on the page at times, it's really no more of a stretch than the hyper-dramatized dialogue of film noir and it's to Winslow's credit that it co-exists ably in the story alongside the language of judicial process and capitalist excess. The sum is a complex world where unlikely allies and enemies are drawn into one believable tapestry by their connections to one another.<br /><br />By the book's end, it's a satisfying world - one that meets the smell test of reality - and one that doesn't linger any longer than is necessary. Not all of the endings are happy but one is left with the sense that those characters who survived were made stronger from their experiences. For many folks, that's the hallmark of good storytelling and, fueled by Winslow's snappy writing, the total package is tough to disparage.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have heard alot about this book, and decided to read it and form my own opinion.  I thought that the writer chose her words beautifully to put together this book.  It was extremely enticing and very provocative.  I found that it may have brought feelings to the surface that alot of woman have hidden.  In the end, I enjoyed the love story that it is.

B0070NSPCU|4.0|This is an excellently written book, well-structured, well-paced.  There is rarely a dull moment.  The only complaint I have is, well, the unimaginative use of standard fantasy tropes, and it wouldn't hurt for the characters to be a bit more vivid and interesting. However, I do like them.  Otherwise, this is a definitely worthy piece of fantasy fiction.  I am glad I bought it.  I would give it a 4.5 stars if I could.
145210655X|5.0|I had seen this in a parenting magazine, and as both my husband, and four year old son LOVE Star Wars, knew it would be a great gift. Luckily, even though was backordered, got it just in time for Father's Day. The book has a lot of laugh out loud pictures of Vader and Luke, things that both the adult can relate to, and things the kids can relate to, all written in an amusing, clever way. I knew it would be liked by my husband, but what I didn't count on though, was that my 4 year old got sooo many of the jokes, (Luke using the force to get down the cookie jar, or doing the potty dance, while insisting he didn't have to go, or listening endlessly to the Ewok's cd (I thought about the Wiggles when I saw that one!!) and my four year old keeps dragging out the book, for Daddy to read to him, and they do, they've read it many times since Father's Day, and the jokes still make them both laugh.

0307887448|1.0|Ugh.  This book.<br /><br />I won't repeat what other reviewers have said about the trite plot, juvenile writing, and cliched 80s pop culture references that fill this book - It's been said before, and said better than I could.  What really bothered me about this book was not the Mary-Sue-ish main characters, the utterly black-and-white morality of every personality that shows up, or the absurdity of the entire plot situation; what bothered me was the inaccuracy of almost every single reference peppered liberally across every page.  To the point that I'm not sure the author actually ever played a game, video or otherwise, in his life.<br /><br />The point when I realized just how little the author knew about gaming was the point when the main character entered the Tomb of Horrors.  First, the author glossed over one of the most iconic roleplaying adventures of all time for reasons I can't quite place - though, thinking about it, he tends to gloss over the really interesting parts of the story in favor of more pop culture references and boring pixel montages.  The main character then ends up at the end of the supposed module where he meets Acererak, the demilich boss of the entire encounter.  Anyone who has knowledge of the Tomb of Horrors module or Dungeons & Dragons in general knows what a demilich is - a floating undead skull animated by the soul of an evil mage, and one of the most iconic monsters in D&D's history.  I mean, the author surely knew this and put this section in to make anyone who tackled this notoriously impossible dungeon smile with nostalgia and think of maybe dusting off the dice and getting the old group back together.  Surely he's actually read the description of the dungeon he wrote into his love story to Nerd Culture, right?<br /><br />Then why did he have Acererak play Joust?<br /><br />Demiliches are floating skulls - THEY DON'T HAVE THUMBS.<br /><br />This is one of the more important moments in the book, and he screwed it up.  He clearlydidn't do his research, not with this and not with anything else.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great free game fun to play.  Love your other apps too.  wish the adds wouldn't just show up. I understand its free but just annoying.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Hey this has a really nice feel to it. worked fine on my Razr. didn't try fb or twitter in it yet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has loot of cool games but some of them are hard to beat but the fun part is that you get to play lots of other games on it and also you can challenge. your self and try to beat all of the different level.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|The version I received is slightly different than some of the pictures, and I suspect this is related to the 2011 revision others have mentioned.  There are 2 differences worth noting:<br /><br />1) This USB port has changed to micro-USB (and is not mini-USB as in the photo).<br />2) The profile will fit through any opening that will accept an OEM Apple 30-pin connector.<br /><br />Both of these are significant improvements to the product.<br /><br />It is priced competitively against similar products, but is the only one I've found that lets you inject power.  This is significant if you want to use something like the Macally iKey30 (a wired iPad keyboard) and charge at the same time.  This product allows it and is in fact the only product I have found that does.<br /><br />I think the placement of a micro-USB port to inject power is very nice, as micro-USB cables are so ubiquitous, and rated to be more durable than mini-USB.<br /><br />Finally, you can both charge AND sync via the micro-USB port.<br /><br />Overall, this is a 5-star product.  The construction is solid, you can charge and sync via either the 30-pin iPod connector or the micro-USB connector, and if using the 30-pin connector for another wired peripheral, you can inject power over the micro-USB port to charge at the same time.  These characteristics make it materially superior to the similar competing products that I've previously used.
0634022296|4.0|Enjoyable and great for sing-a-longs and easy guitar play, but not easy to keep open due to stiff binding.  Took it to an office store and had them cut off the binding and add plastic binding combs and clear plastic covers.  Now it opens flat, ready for singing and playing. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
B005MMJ84K|3.0|I was looking very forward to reading this book. I like Lauren Oliver as a writer and a person in her interviews. I can't say there was one over arching flaw in this book: the action is intense, there is a new romance with an interesting new character, but something was missing that kept me from going head over heals for this book.<br /><br />Lauren writes beautifully. There are several quotes that caught my breath: hate fuels you, but rots you from the inside and a quote about the best books being a door. The context in which they were written maybe left the quote without the full effect that it could have had. I get that the story is a what if dealing with what if the religious right took over the country, but I feel that could have been explored more, especially in relation to Julian, the pro love cure leader's son. I found him to be an interesting character searching for God and reason in his life after being disappointed by the values for which he was being used as the poster child representative. I would have liked to see more about that. Maybe if the first person narrative hadn't been used.<br /><br />I will read the next book despite being disappointed by this one because I want to know what happens with the romantic twists and Lena's discovery of her mother. Over all this is a good book to read this summer.<br /><br />And finally my parent, older reader of YA two cents worth. THere are a number of swear words in this book and the violence is more intense than a lot of YA books. The main character kills several pursuers in self defense and if you have a problem with violence towards animals, there is a killing of a rabbit.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|i got this in the mail about 1 month ago it was a ok product it was very cheap but i guess you get what you pay for
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing I like the coin idea  and the fact you can change avatars I also like the all the cool things u can buy and the super speed invisibility
B007D2XSW0|3.0|I would call this app a work in progress if they want to make $5 a purchase.  Compared to other similar apps like PicSay Pro and Camera Zoom FX, this app is still lacking in features.  However, this app worked well on my acer a500 ICS tablet and the layout was good.  The features are well labeled and shows previews, the layout seems well suited for someone without much technical knowledge, grandma could figure out this app and easy edit and upload pics of her grandkids for example.  Bottom line, this app is great for beginners and casual users, but most will find the features limited for now, let's hope they have some major updates planned for the future.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love this app! it works really well and the pictures come out great! I would definitely reccomend it tobany aspiring photographer :3
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's just BADLY written porn.  There is a story which would have taken about ten pages to write.  I hate that I wasted my money.  I bought it because \\"Over ten million copies sold.\\"  What is wrong with these people?  It is NOT a good, interesting, well written \\"love story.\\"  It's just bad PORN.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game works fine. The only reason it has glitches or is lagging is because if you have a lot of games similar to this one, then yes it will lag. But this game is a lot of fun to play, especially to pass time. The graphics are amazing for a free game. You can change your avatar as you continue to play and buy upgrades. It can get old, but if you set a goal then you'll have something to work for. :)
0743270754|3.0|The author has taken a new shot at a Lincoln biography, incorporating his cabinet into the story.  This makes the story flow more smoothly.  It reveals yet again the base level of politicians and the miracle of Lincoln.  There are some insights into managing your rivals, but not many solid ones.
0374203032|4.0|Prof. Sandel's book is more descriptive than prescriptive. The point is to provoke public discourse and arouse complacent minds to think critically about the unchallenged hegemony of markets and unsupported economic axioms (altruism is a limited resource). Discover the roots of your distaste for line cutters, insurance companies, empty suits in skyboxes, and the theory of market neutrality. The book is pitched to a general audience. One does not need an extensive background in economics or philosophy to fully engage with the text. Recommended for those who believe corporations have displaced families and communities at the center of American life, and for free marketeers who staged the coup.
0061906220|5.0|I bought this book on the advice of my 2 yo son's speech therapist. He is a bit behind in speaking and we were working on his early repetition skills. The book is very simple and repetitive, which is perfect. It also has a cute song, which is also good for teaching language. After 3 days my 4 yo son, who has almost never sung a song in his life, was repeating almost verbatim the whole book and singing the song. The simplicity of the book is perfect for us. The message (Whatever you step in just keep on walking along singing your song) is great. The illustrations are sweet. And I don't get annoyed reading it over and over again. I'm not sure what else you can ask for in a children's book!
B008CPAVZO|4.0|The movie has a good story unlike most recent Zombie films. The comic book style scenes were awesome, like the darkness to it. Overall a solid film
B006X415GK|4.0|If you can snag this doll under the seven dollar mark, it's worth it. She's cute, stylish and was an excellent addition to the Monster collection my daughter already has going.
B0086700CM|5.0|very good game fun to play my whole family luves it and so do i. I like the monkey bird things they are scary lol
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game was so good I love it I love to play it if I could I would play it alot
0984183523|5.0|With his book, Victor offers consulting firm candidates a roadmap to success. The book does not promise you success, but convinces you that there is no substitute to tons of practice, provided you have the correct reference points (e.g., frameworks, do's and dont's). For those that think getting accepted into top consulting firms is a piece of cake, after reading this book you will be disappointed. The book makes it clear that you have to be disciplined and committed to this process.<br /><br />What this book does differently from any other resource is its emphasis on a FEW frameworks, which are the templates that one uses to gather the basic information to crack a case. However, little by little through the book you realize that frameworks exist for a specific purpose, that is, to test hypotheses. Unlike his free online workshop, the book assigns more importance to hypothesis generation and ties this process to the frameworks. Overall, the book brings up and clarifies issues not readily apparent in the six-hour free workshop Victor graciously shares on his website, caseinterview.com.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I only read the sample for this book and it was fantastic!Can't wait to buy the whole Kit and Kaboodle!
B0086700CM|5.0|although I'm not great at this game I cant put it down its very addictive makes me want to get better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I used to play solitaire on my windows desktop/laptop. When I got my Kindle Fire one of the first apps I downloaded was this one. Now I can enjoy it on the go!!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Just downloaded it since it was free, and opened it and pressed the upload button and chose a picture from my album, and it would just reset and give me the intro screen again, tried with uploading a picture straight from camera and it did the same.. Not worth it, free or paid.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I immediately purchased this for my Kindle when I was finished reading the second one.  I love all of the books.  I'm very happy that I purchased all three.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It is a rare occasion that I feel strongly enough to submit a review on a book that I read.<br />I am shocked beyond belief that whomever reads the first book in this trilogy (or tries) would have the intestinal fortitude to subject themselves to more torture by reading two more books! I would far rather be beaten and flogged physically (too), than continue this  trilogy torture. The &#34;lack&#34; of basic writting skills coupled with out dated remarks, i.e. &#34;I'll be a monkies uncle&#34; !? and the fact that 3/4 of the pages contained either; she felt the heat rise in her face or she felt her face flush....it would have been more merciful for this reader if &#34;Miss Anastasia Steele&#34; had burned up by spontaneous combustion durning one of her &#34;heated states&#34;.<br />I give this.....work? two stars because of the writters audacity to publish it !
0345803507|5.0|I read all 3 books in less then a week, n was left wanting more an Im not an every day reader. These books not only captured my attention but made me feel like I was a part of, n knew these ppl personally, or maybe its that it made me want too...lol...Either way it was amazing & I LOVED EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF IT, N EVEN TRIED TO SLOW DOWN  MY READING TO SAVOR THE LAST FEW PAGES/CHAPTERS BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT IT TO END.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|sometimes you have too overlook some reviews and try it for yourself. and if it's free what have you got to loose?  just got it on my kindle fire and have no problems. does exactly what I expected out of a free photo editor. crops, adjusts and has some cute extras. not a professional photo editor, but if you want simple and easy then you should definately download this free and fun app.
B0086700CM|1.0|i got it right when it came out and it was fun for a day! i wish they could have made something else!
0765316994|5.0|I was really skeptical of a meta Trek novel, but Redshirts is a great nod to the hundreds of hours I spent watching Star Trek as a kid.  Great read, pokes fun at the old \\"tech tech tech\\" style those shows were written in while still capturing what we used to love about them.  Wonderful.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Working great  so far including gallery and ability to save to phone. Only got to play for a few minutes this morning but had no problems.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Wish I could earn daily acorns. would make gameplay more interesting. but still good game. wouldn't show a friend request so I could accept one of my friends.
B00633W614|5.0|I finished the first book ony to find that the second was soon to be released. I immediately ordered it, read it and now find I still have to wait to see what happens next. Great read so far but I wonder how many books will be in the Chronicles and when will they be out?
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a wonderful family movie.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially those that have children.  It stresses the importance of a need for both parents, especially having caring fathers in the home.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I am a huge Sherlock fan.  I have read all of the original stories and feel that these movies truely capture how the characters would behave if the stories were writen in modern times.<br />  They are fast paced, never a boring moment.  I prefer to watch movies at home because I am easily bored.  Normally, I have to stop the movie half way through, do something else for a while, and then watch the rest.  With these movies,not only did I find myself glued to the screen, the 90 minutes flew by.  Even friends who don't like the Sherlock books have loved these movies.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game remains me of Mario brothers. the arrow pads are very responsive so it took some time to master thecontrols. very fun game.
B007TBCTRK|5.0|I went into the movie expecting to be pleased, but not to notice the music. I've noted that Marc Streitenfeld's music usually works better when side by side with the movie itself, which is all a soundtrack is, honestly, supposed to do. It's supposed to add weight to scenes and drive the movie forward. That being said, the music caught my attention, and not in a bad way.<br /><br />When I bought the album, it was a bit disconcerting to find the track order was changed. I found that this was for the better, though. \\"A Planet\\", the first track, contains the most complete version of the film's main theme. It is beautiful, with a true sense of exploring the unknown, with all the wonder and fright that goes along with it.<br /><br />The rest of the soundtrack builds on this theme, at times moving, other times aggressively creepy. Songs like \\"Going In\\" and \\"Infected\\" (the two that caught my attention in the film) are moody and ambient. Their subtlety gives them strength, using a repeated series of notes, low and dark, to push the songs through to completion.<br /><br />Other tracks, like \\"Life\\" and \\"Space Jockey\\", are bigger and more epic experiences. They are simple, yet undeniably effective. Marc never goes too big. He keeps it close to home, letting emotion seep into these tracks, and they are nice changes from the usual bombastic music that seems to be crowding the films in theaters these days.<br /><br />\\"Collision\\", which I feel to be the crowning piece on this score, takes the main theme and starts low, constantly building and \\"edging\\" its way to the climax, where it finally unleashes the most thrilling version of the theme yet. It conveys hope, inevitability, and heroism, all in this slow-burning piece, perfectly fitting the character's emotions onscreen.<br /><br />If you've seen the film, I highly recommend getting this item. It's a nice change of pace from the blockbuster soundtracks I've heard recently (Transformers, Avengers), and it is darkly stirring and emotionally rousing. A great listen all around!
0446572993|3.0|Classic Baldalcci setting and characters, all interesting enough. Sadly I knew who the villain was right away. I didn't know why or how they would be \\"bad\\" but I was right. I found the characters engaging, but the storyline a bit weak. Too much explaining at the end to tie up loose ends. Not one of his better stories.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|i loved hunger games. excellent book. catching fire was alright, but too much like the first book. i HATED, HATED, HAAAAAAAATED this book. it flat out sucked...ummm...b***s. it could have been sooooooooooooo much better. you owe me ten, or six, or however much i paid for this sucky book, suzanne collins. screw you suzanne, screw you! if i was catholic, id burn htis book.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Nicely done.  It's the first app that integrates all my news and social streams including google+.  One improvement I might recommend is having a single login  for all Google feeds - Plus, Reader, and You Tube (adding Picasa would be huge btw).  Great stuff!
B0017MVLHG|5.0|This particular album has all the great hits in their longest versions, plus many other lesser-knowns.  Great audio quality.  The collaboration between the gifted and powerful voice of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder yielded some really great music.  Much of the music of the 'disco' era was excellent .. it was the clothes and bling, etc. that was over the top .. those of us who were there didn't like that part of it even then.  But the music, the music .. moves people ... emotionally ... and physically ... gotta dance.<br /><br />This album from her youth (along with later works and YouTube videos), reveals a gifted and intelligent woman of character.  She is missed.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|WOW what a fantastic app! try it you won't believe how easy it is and makes regular photos into quality prints with frames too!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I am planning to upgrade my T-Mobile G2 to a non-physical keyboard Android phone in the next few months (like the Samsung Galaxy S3 or perhaps HTC One S), so this new SwiftKey 3 software allowed me to quickly type on my small 3.7\\" screen using my two thumbs with ease.  I know that with the larger 4\\"+ screens it will only get easier, so I'm looking forward to my upgrade.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a really fun game I love it when my friends first showed me it they had to yank Me of there divice I have to say this is a really popular game I will continue playing temple run and intro duceing people
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The variety of games is diverse and challenging. this app will keep you on toes. don't miss out. download this app today.
B003B02OQ4|1.0|The problem with Grisham is that his novels are either very strong or very weak. I've read 10 or so, and the rule has never failed. This is one of the lousy ones, right from the outset. The whole thing is unloaded on you like a ton of bricks, in a clumsy and forced manner. The situations, the characters, the conversations have no credibility whatsoever. I cannot believe that such drivel comes from the same writer whose magical pen produced classic thrillers and political suspense novels. The stylish writing and the typical wit you've come to expect from Grisham are just not there.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome app for the Kindle Fire! Best one I have tried and so incredibly simple and easy to use with a stylus or appendage.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this app. it is ssoooo addictive. I cant stop playing it. I love the objectives I cant stop thinking about them!!I love that there is noooo glitches.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app of all time, you will always find time for God with this . It give multiple versions of the Bible in different languages! 5/5
B007SGM084|2.0|I bought the trilogy so read the whole thing. Didn't need to -  the first 50 pages pretty much captures it.  Way too long, bad editing, EXTREMELY repetitive, thin plot, and even the sex gets wearing and isn't that titillating!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a cool App. Not too many ads. No glitches. Easy to use. I play it every day. Lots of fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|all my friends have an ipod touch and they have that. I started playing it now I'm ADDICTED!!!!!!!! WOO TEMPLE RUN '-'
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Plain and simple, this is the best Rush I have heard since moving pictures. Stand out songs for me are The Garden which deals with a persons legacy. Also, the wreckers which tells a story of a ship that is run aground by \\"wreckers\\" (who back in the day made fake light towers to crash boats). Finally, headlong flight is just instrumentally awesome in every way. As for the other tracks, They are Fantastic also, it was a hard album to pick a top 3 out of
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an app that I use daily along with my daily devotion and prayer. I have found this app very useful. Whether you are a new believer or a veteran this will definitely strengthen you as a christian.
B00881VLCE|4.0|entertaining but manuvering can be tricky.  you have to sscroll though the puzzle pieces and I still can't<br /> get that feature to work consistently.  I have trouble even choosing a puzzle
B000YENUIQ|1.0|I purchased a DVD from the seller and when I opened the package there was a sticky tag on one side of the DVD and upon removal it ruined the disk. It was obviously repackaged. It was only $5 but when you can only use it as a coaster, it's $5 too much.
B004LWZW88|4.0|Me and my girls love this movie, would have given it 5 stars but there is something wrong with the blue-ray, the sound is very quiet and I have to turn the sound all the way up to hear the movie.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Makes you sign into facebook or twitter to upload and save your pic. It's free though.  I wouldn't want to pay for this..
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Basic editing right here... hope there are better out there cud I have yet to find an android photo editor that I'm truely fond of, better luck on the next one.
0670022411|1.0|If you like tedious descriptions of clothing, food, scene, and anything else that has NOTHING to do with the story, you'll love this book. The plot lagged, badly, in the first 100 pages and just sort of stalled for me completely around page 200. It's romance. It's all throbbing this and him being overprotective and her lapping it up and sleeping and horseback riding and lots of other stuff I could NOT care less about. Honestly, if you like this sort of thing, enjoy. If not, steer clear.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|This is an album that you simply must buy. Hendrix is so magical and the quality of this pressing is superb. A definite best buy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was encouraged by a friend to read this book, though she warned the sex was so naughty, but told me I just HAD to read it.  I'm in the Human Services field and I won't lie, the beginning of book 1 indicated red flag after red flag to me of a soon-to-be abusive relationship.  But, I soon became more comfortable with the way things were going and heeded my girlfriend's advice to \\"keeeeeepp reeeeeeading!!\\" when I voiced my worry about where this story was going!<br /><br />In a phrase, BEST SEX OF MY LIFE.  I think my husband and I are picking at each other less and less because I just want him all the time!!  He threatened to limit my reading about half way through book one because his work schedule leaves him exhausted and he could barely keep up with my...appetite. ;)<br /><br />Now into book 2, he continues to be \\"pleased with the results\\" of my extracurricular...um,...motivation.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I will say, it scares me to death to think of young girls/women reading this.  Especially those who are not married and don't already have a trusting relationship with a spouse.  I'm all about spicing the sex life (oh, this is way more than spicing...)of a married couple.  But my fear is that young girls (24 and younger) will read this and be swayed to think that a dominating man will also be as gentle and lenient as Mr. Grey becomes.  Not so, ladies.  In my professional opinion, dominating men don't care for their women and this goes south quickly.  To clarify, I don't just mean sexually dominating...I mean overall possessive and domineering behavior.  That type of behavior has future-domestic-violence written all over it.  I'm not sure I've encountered a situation where the man was able to turn off his domineering demeanor when not in the \\"bed-room\\" (or where ever you're having sex!) So, young women...please heed a warning.<br /><br />All that said, the movie rights have been sold and I have no freakin' idea how they will produce this...story.  And, who in the WORLD will play the devastatingly handsome Mr. Grey?  I typically only enjoy a novel if people are dying or having hot sex.  And in this book, there isn't much dying, but there is lots and LOTS of hot HOT, delicious sex, like every other scene. ;)  Enjoy! And I recommend warning your husband...and involving both parties in an exercise regime prior to Chapter 9.
B00186X1T2|5.0|This is as iconic as their first album and contains some incredible guitar work. It shows Knopfler and company as a tight, well-structured band at the height of their careers. The sound quality is a bit scratchy in places but Tunnel of Love is playable time after time. The vinyl version is better but then I am a vinyl lover so am biased, but the CD version is very good.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Awesome app - now I can get exactly what I turned the news on for without sitting through commercials.  Well done and easy to use.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. Sandra Bullock did one of the best performances I have ever seen. I just saw it for the first time a month or so ago and have watched it 4 more times since. One if the best 'feel good' movies I have ever seen!!
0440539811|5.0|So... nice to meet you. How are you? Im fine, thanks. In my opinion this is a good book. Good luck. Bye!
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|No substance. I shut off the movie in the middle because the story was not interesting. Mainstream media cranks out products like this simply to make money. Even if it flopped at the box office (which I understand it did) they profit. Another good reason to read instead.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you value accuracy, knowledge, and have an interest in BDSM, and want a REAL erotica novel with depth and maturity.... DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Put it down, back away slowly, and run as fast as possible. If you decided after reading this book that you wanted to try BDSM or some aspects of it, I suggest you go actually find the REAL BDSM community and poke around and get some REAL information.<br /><br />There are plenty of great BDSM based erotica novels that can give you an accurate and healthy insight into our world. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. At all. Edit [02/06/2014]: In fact, a group of Intimate Partner Violence and Domestic Abuse specialists have recently completed a legitimate study whose conclusion is that \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is a fictional representation of an abusive relationship. To view the study, please go here: [...]<br /><br />It's terrible. I cannot even express how absolutely abhorrent this book is on so many levels. I couldn't even get to the halfway point of the book before I had to put it down. Unfortunately, I was dumb enough to waste the money on it without reading reviews, or looking up anything about it. Thanks Amazon Kindle store, for suggesting a piece of pure [~]. I wish I could give it 0 stars. It doesn't even deserve ONE.<br /><br />This is NOT Erotica; This is NOT BDSM; This is not sexy, hot, titillating, or anything else; And this CERTAINLY CAN'T even constitute a novel at all. Sincerely, an actual practicing member of the BDSM community currently engaged in the community and teaching about healthy BDSM.<br /><br />For one, the book is so poorly written. The dialogue, characters, story... All of it is so generic, superficial, one dimensional, and ridiculous. It's stale. It's sad. It's so terrible there's not a word in the English language to describe it. Trust me, I've tried to find one. The main heroin is a joke. She's sniveling, blind, naiive, dumb as rocks \\"damsel in distress\\" meets \\"Dumb blonde\\" stereotype. The main hero is just as bad. Powerful, egotistical, slightly saddistic, uber rich, \\"do whatever I want\\" bay boy stereotype. NEITHER characters have any dimension, no true or decent character development, and absolutely no endearing traits what-so-ever; the story is plotless. There's no originality, and as one reviewer aptly pointed out, the characters are pretty much a regurgitation of Twilight characters with different names. Not to mention the author reuses the same, typical, ridiculous phrases, and cannot even honestly be mature enough to write an erotica novel that uses mature phrases. The whole thing reads as if it was written by a 16 year old with no writing or sexual experience what-so-ever, who's decided to try and make a novel out of their first, and ultimately ridiculous, sexual fantasy... Which isn't too far from a possibility considering the author not only obviously knows nothing about BDSM, but they obviously did not bother to do any form of research before beginning the novel. If the author had ever been, in any way, actually associated with the BDSM community, OR had actually done her research, the BDSM elements in this novel would not be as completely unsafe, unhealthy, and inaccurate as they are. It's absolutely terrible and does no justice or favor to the BDSM community but to solidify already existing negative ideals of it's relationships and practices, and promote inaccurate and misleading information about them... And don't even get me started on the relationships between the characters. Considering this book started out as a Twilight fan fiction, it shouldn't really have come as any shock to me that this book also promotes and romanticized VERY UNHEALTHY views about romance, sex, and healthy relationships.<br /><br />And this is the part that bothers me the most about the book (hence why I'm about to write a lengthy post about it where I've only mildly grazed on the above problems). Not only is it what bothers me the most, but it is the MOST IMPORTANTthing about why you SHOULD NOT pick up this book.<br /><br />To you all saying \\"BDSM is consensual\\", you're absolutely, 100% correct. BDSM operates on two primary phrases: \\"SSC\\", meaning Safe, Sane, and Consensual; and \\"RACK\\", or Risk Aware Consensual Kink. While they both describe two separate mentalities within BDSM, they both boil down to the same fundamental principles: That all play is within the confines of safety and sanity for both parties (physically, mentally, AND emotionally safe, not just one... ALL); that all actions are consented upon and agreed to by both parties before play (usually what we call \\"negotiating\\"); and trust that your partner(s) will abide by the rules, boundaries, safe words, precautions, etc, set forth previous to play (the result of these negotiations we often call \\"contracts\\") - as well as your partner(s) actually doing so; as well as both parties being completely knowledgeable on the risk of any actions during play.<br /><br />Like any other relationship (those non-BDSM practicing, we often call \\"Vanilla\\") there is the possibility of domestic violence, and abuse. We have, within the BDSM community, very STRICT definitions of what qualifies as abuse within a BDSM relationship, both emotionally and physically. You will all be surprised (more than likely) to find out that these criterion are not unlike the criterion for domestic violence and abuse in \\"Vanilla\\" relationships. Some of these things are:<br /><br />* The abuser keeps the victim unaware of what is going on and what changes are taking place. Example: Your partner might control your finances, make plans for you, or not tell you what his/her plans are until the last minute. He/she may talk about you to others behind your back, to isolate you from them.<br />* The abuser controls the victim's time and physical environment, and works to suppress much of the victim's old behavior. The victim is slowly, or abruptly, isolated from all supportive persons except the abuser. Example: Your partner might have insisted that you stop certain social, hobby, or work activities. You might have gotten moved to a new location, farther away from your family and friends. Or you may have been asked (or told) to reduce or stop contact with specific supportive people in your life.<br />* The abuser creates in the victim a sense of powerlessness, fear, and dependency. Example: Verbal and emotional abuse creates these emotions. They become stronger and stronger over time.<br />* The abuser works to instill new behavior and attitudes in the victim. This new behavior erodes your self-confidence and self-esteem.<br />* The abuse puts forth a closed system of logic that allows for no input or criticism. In other words it is their way or the highway.<br />* Abuser may coerce or force a victim into agreements without their full informed consent, especially long-term contracts with newcomers.<br />* Abuser may manipulate a victim into financial or emotional dependence without taking precautions should conflict occur or the need to leave arise.<br />* Abuser may exert non-consensual control, dominance or abuse of a partners children or make demands that go against maternal or paternal responsibilities. (I.E. Restricting access to children as punishment.)<br />* Abuser may use threats of abandonment or loss of current contract if new demands are not met.<br />* Abuser may force victim to do things alone, together or with others in ways that violate or compromise previous negotiations.<br />* Abuser may use name calling, mind games, denial of human necessities like food, water, shelter as needed, health care and so forth, especially in ways that reduce a victim's self-esteem.<br />* Abuser may threaten to expose victim or your lifestyle to `vanilla' co-workers, family members, or children.<br />* Abuser may initiate inappropriate or harmful punishments or withhold appreciation or affection as punishment.<br />* Abuser may deny a behavior is abusive and/or may minimize abuse. The abuser may also accuse you of making abuse up, not being submissive/Dominant enough, and so forth.<br /><br />Those are some of the very basic ones constituting emotional abuse in BDSM relationships. As a member of the BDSM community, let me make something VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY clear: Not only do the relationships meet almost all criteria set forth by several organizations outlining the forms of domestic violence and what constitutes them in normal (vanilla) relationships, they also meet all criteria set forth by the BDSM community and the National Leather Association's International Abuse and Domestic Violence Project concerning abuse in BDSM relationships and what constitutes it.<br /><br />The key word to ALL of this, however, (whether you are a standard submissive, a \\"lifestyler\\" a \\"leather\\", or anything in-between) is \\"CONSENT\\". You must CONSENT to give up this power over your own life, you must CONSENT to do these things asked or required of you, and there is very, very, very lengthy and detailed negotiations (where both parties are 100% equal) that go into it before any final action is taken; IF, at any point, any member of the play or party may choose to stop, be released from the contract, or leave, and their wishes MUST be respected and accommodated.<br /><br />Manipulated consent does not count as consent. Coerced consent does not count as consent. Forced consent does not count as consent. Modified consent does not count as consent. Once consent leaves the picture, once they begin to feel trapped, isolated, etc, nce the behavior becomes manipulative, and so on... Then it no longer becomes a BDSM relationship. Any form of manipulation automatically voids consent. It becomes an unhealthy and abusive relationship.<br /><br />Now go through that very basic list and check off which ones the relationship on FSoG meet. It's damned near all of them, and then more.<br /><br />For more information about Abuse in BDSM, the National Leather Association International Domestic Violence and Abuse Project is a great place to start. Another option is The Domme Daycare (undergoing reorganization, currently), The Submissive Guide, and others.<br /><br />To reiterate what I stated earlier: If you value accuracy, knowledge, and have an interest in BDSM, and want a REAL erotica novel with depth and maturity.... DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Put it down, back away slowly, and run as fast as possible. If you decided after reading this book that you wanted to try BDSM or some aspects of it, I suggest you go actually find the REAL BDSM community and poke around and get some REAL information.<br /><br />There are plenty of great BDSM based erotica novels that can give you an accurate and healthy insight into our world. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. At all. Edit [02/06/2014]: In fact, a group of Intimate Partner Violence and Domestic Abuse specialists have recently completed a legitimate study whose conclusion is that \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is a fictional representation of an abusive relationship. To view the study, please go here: [...]<br /><br />It's terrible. I cannot even express how absolutely abhorrent this book is on so many levels.

Thanks Amazon Kindle store, for suggesting a piece of pure [~]. I wish I could give it 0 stars. It doesn't even deserve ONE.<br /><br />This is NOT Erotica; This is NOT BDSM; This is not sexy, hot, titillating, or anything else; And this CERTAINLY CAN'T even constitute a novel at all.

B000NU2CY4|5.0|I'm not here to give my opinions of plot and acting.  My book report days ended years ago.  Only the quality of the film on blu ray means anything to me and you can decide whether you like the actual film on  your own.<br /><br />Disc one has both the theatrical release ,which Ridley Scott claims is the Director's cut ,  as well as the Extended version with plenty of additional footage.  I have both the original SD release and the Sapphire SD releases and this 2 disc set takes the cake for video transfer quality.  Deep dark blacks and rich hues even in muted scenes.  Really quite excellent.<br />The audio is DTSHD lossless audio but often the score itself seems to envelope the foley effects of the action which occurs in too many spots to specify.  Never the less, the audio sounds great on my fairly esoteric audio system.<br /><br />The 2nd disc contains more extras than you might want to watch in one sitting.  While the letters on the back of the disc are simply too small for me to read, I ordered the disc from Amazon about 1 month ago and just got to it today.  I have watched the Gladiator many times and always enjoy it. One of these days I will travel to Pompei myself.  In the meantime, be assured that the quality of the Sapphire Edition of Gladiator is well worth it.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am finding it hard to finish the first book. I love erotica. I also love compelling characters that either make me like or hate them. I find I just don't care about any of the flat characters portrayed within the pages. The writing is as flat as the characters. The sex scenes are not as racy as I would imagine for a book on bondage, etc. I find it highly unlikely that a real Dominant would pick Ana. There is quite the process of weeding out that goes on in picking a Sub and she certainly does not display with any conviction someone who has bought into that lifestyle.<br /><br />I am having a hard time reconciling what I have read so far with the fervor it has stirred up. Not sure if I will complete the book, very doubtful I will bother with the series. Maybe the movie will be better.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|having lived in Hawai'i for 7 years, and after seeing \\"The Descendants\\" on video, I knew I had to have the soundtrack and Amazon was the best way to go.  This is the best Hawai'ian CD I have.  Gabby is an icon in Hawai'ian music.  When I lived there the Beamers were also going strong.  Add in some Makaha Sons and you know, if you've ever lived or visited, Hawai'i Nei, this is Da Kine.
0345525558|3.0|I'd like to give a kind warning that parts of this review may reveal significant parts of the plot.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly hoped to give The Language of Flowers four or five stars.  What a compelling concept:  the relationship of a woman with flowers; her own secret language (she also happens to grow up in a challenging foster care life).  The story synopsis alludes to the Victorian legacy of each flower having a meaning, with the giving and use of flowers as a novel way to express emotion and send messages to others.<br /><br />Ultimately, I felt there wasn't enough of that language of flowers in the novel.  It's too bad because I felt that the author had an incredible keen knowledge of this topic and could have weaved more of it into her plot.  The story began believable, with the first person voice of the narrator pulling the reader right in.  But as the story progressed, it began to disintegrate with its farfetched and unrealistic developments until it wasn't believable to me anymore.<br /><br />The main character Victoria, barely getting by after fleeing her foster mom, is hired in a flower shop though she has no work experience or education.  She gets pregnant, leaves her job, and ends up spending some time in a nearby park, sleeping on the ground.  She plans to labor alone in her small apartment, with no prenatal care, like the Virgin Mary who gives birth alone under a tree.<br /><br />But Victoria miraculously gets interrupted by a midwife knocking on her door, who then delivers the baby.  The heroine eventually abandons her infant daughter in a basket in the home of the child's father while he's not even there.  Numerous times Victoria leaves the child alone, which is hard to believe for any mother.  If Victoria is capable of doing all this, we needed further development of her character to understand these almost cruel streaks.  I didn't find this story believable, and though I found Victoria's passion for flowers believable, there wasn't enough of it to carry the story forward.to carry the story forward.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am addicted to this game!  It's a shame, really, the amount of time I spend playing it.  Each time I start playing,  I refuse to stop until I have surpassed my high score.  Extremely entertaining, challenging, and a great time waster (i.e. when you are in the waiting room of a doctor's office, on a road trip, etc.)

1401307450|1.0|Before reading this book I had respect for Anthony Kiedis, I thought he was a thoughtful and caring person. I thought he was spiritual and had respect for humanity. Of course this book changed all that. Truth is this book makes me think keides is one of the most vile persons to ever exist.<br /><br />Some of kiedis's sins<br />-having promiscuous sex with 14 year old girls.<br />-stealing safety equipment (inflatable life vests) from airplanes so he could inflate them on-stage for dramatic effect.<br />-raging heroin addiction along with being a minor dealer to his girlfriends and others so he could support his own habit.<br />-caring nothing about the band or his music, not showing up for practice or shows.<br />-constantly referring to himself and his art as \\"beautiful\\" while seemingly caring nothing about it.<br />-mocking the Jewish religion because he felt LA police would give him a break for drug charges because he was Jewish.<br />-Stealing from everyone who offered their friendship towards him.<br /><br />In a way i want people to read this so they can see  what a vapid, self-obsessed person Kiedis is. The whole book speaks volumes to his arrogance and inherent sense of superiority.
B0086700CM|5.0|Right on top of my list of favorites..... Can't wait for a second in the series or maybe a tshirt w / a pic of me riding the ride that is.....Temple Run.

B0079R8KXG|5.0|With all the reviews, good and bad that are out there regarding kindle fire covers, I was skeptical of buying any of them. I settled on this marware case and am very happy with my purchase. My kindle fits perfectly in the clips, the elastic strap keeps it tightly closed when not in use and your able to stand the kindle up at many different angles. Thumbs up!

B007XNAQLA|5.0|B. Bernardini ... I think your jazz professors better go back to music school. HeeHee! This is an incredible product... probably another one of Chick's Grammy awards waiting to happen. Just so fortunate to be getting a quality release from RTF -- again, the sound mix is out of this world! -- even though the venerable guitarist Al DiMeola is left off this one. I understand drummer Lenny White did the bulk of the mixing of this CD. It couldn't be any better! The addition of Frank Gambale and inclusion of strings player Jon Luc Ponty makes is an acceptable tradeoff.<br /><br />As for tempos of songs, it's not unusual for this to happen as music is heard over years (decades, in this instance). Futhermore, its authors probably know note-for-note where to take it to the next levcel. Totally love what RTF IV did to \\"Spain\\" and many other tracks. It just is part of maturation of the music. Sometimes more space between notes is of value. Long-time RTF fans... and those who saw the group on the live 2011 tour ... will no doubt be blown away when they hear this CD/ DVD.<br /><br />A must-buy! Long Live Return To Forever!
B004LWZW8I|1.0|Watch the first 10 minutes and you know the rest. It's utterly canned, copied, shallow, and formulaic: a brutal, insulting, jingoistic hero-beats-villain-and-gets-girl gorefest with indecipherable dialogue, improbable fight scenes, gaping plot gaps, and lousy lighting (worse than Meek's Cutoff, and that's saying something) that makes numerous scenes unwatchable. Even the casting is distractingly bad. Even the love scene is botched. This one is a true rotter. However, the DVD is quite smooth and round and might be useful for skipping on water.

030758836X|5.0|It is interesting to me--but not surprising--that a tiny segment of this book's readers give it low marks. I detect two consistent themes in those reviews.<br />Before I get to that, let me put in writing my FIRST reactions to this novel: creative and complex story, daring approach, flawless context, remarkably courageous personal insight, glib-witty-brutal-unflinching narrative.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even when it made me itchy and twitchy and feel uncomfortably exposed.<br />And THAT brings me to the second theme in those negative reviews.  (I'll get to the first one in a moment).  Be assured, if you decide to read this book you're going to find little pieces of yourself and of people you know or care about woven through the cast of characters.  And it won't be the best pieces, either.  It will be the quirks and traits and harsh sentiments that all of us hope to keep hidden, not only from others but from ourselves, as well. Not everyone can look at that kind of naked emotion and see it as powerful, revelatory writing.  Some of us are going to find it uncomfortable enough to dislike the book and to find flimsy complaints on which to blame that dislike: characters, language, writing style. And some of us are going find it uncomfortable enough to dislike the book but recognize nonetheless that it is a riveting story told with skill, imagination, and intelligence, and therefore we have to go for criticism number one... the ending. And those are the criticisms that make the least sense to me. I can't imagine, after nearly 500 pages of wandering around in the skulls of these characters, what sort of happy or tragic or poetically just ending the critics might have anticipated. The end of the book (but certainly not the end of the story) is as natural and logical as all that leads us to it.  Granted, that's not very natural or logical for most of us, but it's what THESE characters would do; it's what they DESERVE.  And in that there is a sort of literary integrity.  It's not a Hurray! or a Yahoo! or a Gotcha! It's not TV.  It's a continuation of the lives these pathetically twisted people have knowingly, willingly, compulsively built for themselves.

B007PAAO0Y|1.0|Womack isn't the first Soul, Blues, rock or reggae singer to incorporate dance beats (hip hop,techno, house) into his music but Womack's beats sound so out of date and plastic it's hard to just get lost in the music (same problem with Jimmy Cliff's awful \\"Black Magic\\" album). Those cheesy programmed drums keep sticking out as a sore thumb. This album is a huge disappointment to those of us expecting a classic Soul album.
B003Y5H5F6|2.0|This movie was very disappointing.  I am a huge Underworld fan and thankfully I did not go see this movie at the theater or I would have been really upset.  Its only an hour and fifteen minutes long and they could have cut out half of it.  Wait until it goes on sale and then buy it.  I hope the next movie is a lot better.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|One thing that came to my mind when I was reading was that Christian is the devil. I wanted the characters to be more complex and I hope they do in book two. Three stars because I couldnt stop reading. Overall the book is kinda sad, Christian's problem is evident but we dont know why is Ana's self esteem so low to begin with. Id hate for a young girl to read this book. it gives a lot of the wrong insights on love and relationships. Its a quick read for an adult  who wants a glimpse of the s&m world though.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|I always find Smashing Pumpkins fan's to be the harshest critics (a lot of the time unjustified) of their favorite band. You rarely see this with other artists that are get 4.7 ratings on Amazon and put out absolute garbage. Or it could be the band attracts a lot of haters due to the often misunderstood Billy Corgan. Either way, this album is a fantastic effort and blows the last two official Pumpkins albums out of the water: The drudge-y and often overbearing Machina I and the half-hearted Zeitgeist album. Oceania delivers enough textured melodies and soundscapes sure to please any listener.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Awesome trilogy to read just didn't want to see it end,recommend to everyone ,Ana and her mr grey had a very interesting relationship in every way.and oh my god red room had every toy available I think they lacked nothing in there,where oh where is our mr grey!!!!!

Very little delay in applying the filters, effects, frames, etc. Autofix looks very good.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice app. Also nice that it gives you the option of how high a quality image you want to save when you select one of the 3 save buttons. Pic appears in gallery as any other pic when you choose to save to phone.<br /><br />Nice app. EVO 4G LTE.
B0000028M7|3.0|While \\"Alice In Chains\\" was one of the big 3 bands in their hey-day (along with Nirvana and Pearl Jam), their music has aged worse than the other two band's music has. I would only recommend \\"Dirt\\" to fans of Alice In Chains, not necessarily for fans of early-90s Grunge/Punk.

B00006RU5B|4.0|While I can't argue this is a well-crafted album (maybe one of the best-produced albums of the last 20 years), it feels really...slick. Over-polished. Not at all 'raw'. Audioslave is a great piecing-together of two great bands (Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine), but it feels almost too deliberate. This doesn't make Audioslave's self-titled debut album a bad listen by any means. It just feels overly radio-friendly, and not as subversive as one would like.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|It was the most suspenseful ride in a movie that I have seen in a long time. Watching two different worlds collide, the seedy underworld and the so called respectable one, join forces in the person of Daniel Craig's character and the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. I believe that there is talk of a part two. Great! I can not wait.

B004EPYZUS|5.0|I found that the new sequel did not disappoint. This movie tied some loose ends up from the last ones and moved the sequel forward with the new. If there is to be a continuation? Good!
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|First of all, the book contains countless talk about all the drugs (prescription and otherwise) and alcohol Ozzy has done over the years, as well as the dumbass things he has done for amusement... yeah, I know I rated this a 4 star, don't get ahead of me... however, who can begrudge Ozzy a chance to further express himself and reveal the overwhelming magnitude of the atrocities and madness of his life? This is a man that has spent his life entertaining people from one medium to another: amusing kids at school (to avoid bullying), amusing people in jail (similar reason), amusing friends and band mates and pretty much everyone that has come anywhere near him with all kinds of pranks and who knows what else, as well as entertaining the whole world with his music and tv show, and now his books.<br /><br />This book gives a great view into Ozzy's life, particularly for those who have never known his full career (as let's face it, many of us fans of Ozzy have not been around since he started). Going through all the drugs, alcohol, and other things, and shows his honest remorse for the more tragic of experiences, such as his slaughtering chickens, biting the head off of a bird and a bat, and terrible actions as a father.<br /><br />Some musicians, like James Hetfield of Metallica, find music and writing lyrics to be a form of therapy, and that's kind of what this book seems like to me: Ozzy talks about everything that has happened, including the great sadness of Randy Rhoads' death and the end of his career with Black Sabbath, as if to get some of that off his mind, lower the issue, and express it all.<br /><br />Would I recommend buying, or reading, this book? Without a doubt... I enjoyed it immensely, and have read it more than once since I originally bought it (which was soon after it was originally released), even bought 2 extra copies more recently as gifts.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this omnibus after reading a couple of reviews, knowing nothing of the author. He has quickly become a favourite, and I plan to buy more of his books.<br /><br />Within the first few sentences, I was utterly drawn into the world of Wool. The characters are all interesting and lovingly developed. No mere throwaways, they all have something to offer to the grand plot of this marvelous work of art.<br /><br />Having finished the Wool Omnibus, as well as the sixth installment of the Wool series, I can safely say that these books are hard to put down. The plot never drags, but also never feels rushed. Hugh Howey writes with the confidence of someone who truly has a story to tell. I'm looking forward to seeing where the Wool universe ends up!
B005VPRETE|5.0|What more can be said about LEGOs? They are the greatest child's \\"toy\\" ever, encouraging building, creating, participating. Olivia's tree house is beautifully made and my 8 yr old daughter had a great time putting it together. She and her buddies get together and have a great time creating stories and reshaping the treehouse. SO much better than many of the more passive games out there (read -videogames.) 100% recommended.
1781161313|5.0|I purchased this book thru Amazon for about $30 or so a few years ago after searching for it at a reasonable price. It was very hard to come by for a looooong time. Now I see this re-release and I have only one question. The cover is different from the one that I have but is anything else different? Was it updated with any new material or is it a straight reissue? If anyone that has the new one could share some insights it would be terribly helpful? In other words....... do I have to buy it again? LOL. Thanks to any who read this!<br /><br />BTW: mine has a copyright by HarperPrism of June 1996.

B004HW7JH4|2.0|I agree with bits and pieces of all the reviews. I also wanted to like Season 5 because I love and have watched and rewatched Seasons 1 through 4, and while there were a few episodes that are some of the best Mad Men has ever done, overall I found Season 5 as a whole to be weak and thrown together.  I never felt attached or particularly interested in any of the new characters that were introduced and many of them felt more like caricatures rather than characters.  Right out of the gate I found the marital trials and tribulations of Don and Megan irritating, tiresome, and endless.  I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer that said if episodes 1 and 2 (which were linked together) were a pilot, the show never would have gotten off the ground.  By episode 13 I didn't know how much more I could watch of Megan emoting after every single line of Don's, and wondered just how much more screen time Weiner could give Jessica Pare.  I was never bored by Betty and Don, Megan and Don just made me yawn.  At the end of each season I was almost depressed to see it end, I was so hooked and wanted it to keep going.  By the end of Season 5, it almost was a relief.  Considering that this is one of the best shows ever done, I could almost feel Matthew Weiner's boredom grinding out these scripts.  And when I read the reviews that say this is the best season ever, I wonder if we have been watching the same series.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and again, there were a few episodes of brilliance but not enough to make this season an emmy winner.  Also, how is it that no one remembers at the end of Season 4, Megan standing on the balcony telling Don, \\"I don't want to be an actress!\\" and all we have heard out of that mouth is nothing but drival about acting?  I'm going to vote with my wallet and not buy Season 5.  To me, comparing Season 5 to the previous 4 seasons is like comparing Rod Serling's Twilight Zone to his later Night Gallery.  Yes, I think Matthew Weiner is a genius butam amazed so few people are willing to say \\"the emperor has no clothes\\".  Even more amusing is the cover of the Season 5 dvd case which has an Emmy on the cover, but Mad Men did not win a single Emmy for that season.
B006RUJST6|4.0|Format: Kindle Genre: Young Adult Romance (?). Obviously, I wasn't quite sure how to categorize this book's genre. Yes, it is about a start-stop-start-pause-? relationship between a 21 year-old college age teaching assistant and an 18 year-old high school senior but do the ages of a book's characters dictate the genre? In this case I'm saying yes. And here's why: The ending. ****SPOILER ALERT**** (Skip to the next paragraph if you want to avoid the spoiler here.) Everything turns out ok for the two lead characters in the end, but it is at the expense of expunging anyone who is over 22 years of age. That's fantasy land for most young adult readers. A world without adults, a home without parents.<br /><br />Both the narratives' young characters face overwhelming life circumstances--one (Will) appears to manage his trauma well, while the other (Lake) is still learning what it means to act the grown-up. The plot opens with Lake  (and her mother and brother) moving from Texas to Michigan after the unexpected death of her father. There through her younger brother she meets Will. Lake and Will fall in love at first sight but that romance is brought to an abrupt halt when they realize that their life-circumstances prevent them from being together. The author parses out Will's backstory through poetry readings and anecdotal conversations so he is something of a mystery for readers. Lake's backstory, on the other hand, is plopped down right in the face of readers from the very first pages of the book. So as readers we know where she's coming from, how she thinks, what she wants, when she's confused, and just how dang spoiled this young woman is. Lake has a lot of growing up to do and if Slammed is suppose to be a coming of age novel then is almost misses the mark. (I'm back to the ending, which I won't spoil again.)<br /><br />Despite it's weakness as a written work, the narrative flows quickly. The plot is a little contrived, but engaging. The chronological pace is fine although the end felt somewhat rushed. I liked most of the characters, with the exception of Lake--she's immature and her common-sense is only half-baked; she's smart but doesn't act it. I liked some of the dialog. I liked that Will was something of a mystery to Lake and us as readers. But here's the thing--I'll forget about this book in a couple of days, because there is nothing amazing or lasting to take away from it. I give this book four stars and here's why: I want to give it three and a half stars because it is better than mediocre but not good enough to be on the upper end of the star scale. And half stars, like half-baked characters, don't work here.

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I have Azada on my Kindle and I love it. I have read some complaints about the puzzles repeating, but I actually enjoy the repeated puzzles as they get progressively more difficult as the game advances through the plot. The tower puzzle at the end of the game is a far cry from the tower puzzle at the beginning. Well worth what I paid for it.

B0018QCXH8|5.0|To celebrate my 100th passive-aggresive review shot out like projectile diarrhea out on Amazon's pages to the horror of many, I've chosen a personal favorite of mine: There Will Be Blood, where the only criticism I can find about it is the name. There Will Be Blood chronicles the life of Daniel Plainview, an ambitious miner-turned-oilman in search of fortune during the early 1900's when the industrial revolution was hitting the western United States.<br /><br />The themes present throughout the film range from family to isolation, greed to power, and creation of a town to destruction of one's mind. The whole time slowly showing Daniel's fall from grace and descent into alcohol-fueled madness in his self-percieved 'victory', whilst he's isolated himself from everyone that loved him into his hollow mansion.<br /><br />Early on in the movie one of Daniel's men dies due to a rigging accident, leaving his infant son behind to the care of Daniel Plainview. When Daniel's going from town to town offering his services he uses his 'son' H.W. to show everyone that he is a family man and not a faceless Union Oil lobbyist. As his business expands Daniel shows H.W. the tools of the trade, some tips and pointers, and is raising H.W. to be his successor. However due to another oil accident (before the insurance days) H.W. is caught in the loud pressure release of the excavation and becomes permanently deaf, unable to communicate to Daniel anymore. So what does Daniel, the warm-hearted and loving family man do? Send his son off to a San Francisco boarding school for the deaf of course! After his 'healing' from Eli however Daniel takes his son back and brings him a teacher, in order to assist with communicating.<br /><br />Near the end when Daniel is in his lofty mansion his son approaches him to tell him that he's breaking off with his father and starting his own drilling company in Mexico. Daniel takes this as a business threat and disowns H.W. right there on the spot, calling him nothing more than a cute face used for buying land. H.W. walks away and Daniel is left alone in his dark mansion, a few fleeting memories of H.W. passing through his mind, showing the audience that Daniel really did love his adopted son at some point. So what drove them apart, was it H.W. going deaf? Was it Daniel gaining all of his riches? Or did they just slowly have a falling out as H.W. matured more and grew to know his father in another light?<br /><br />Another plot point in the movie is where Daniel meets his long lost supposed brother Henry who heard about Daniel striking big and wants to offer his assistance. It is with  Henry who Daniel feels the most comfortable with revealing his deepest and darkest thoughts, how he hates most people, and wants to make a fortune to get away from everybody. The fact that Daniel trusts his supposed brother so much shows that somewhere deep down he has a sense and admiration for family bonds and trust, but somewhere for some reason he's been alienated from his own family and has a fractured family of his own. It kind of makes me laugh when I think of the scenes with Daniel, Henry, and H.W. together, a supposed 'family' when in actuallity none of them are even remotely related. Daniel eventually gains suspicions about Henry and puts him to the test to see if he's really the brother, the supposed brother who Daniel has shared his darkest secrets with has infiltrated his trust and guard. After putting Henry down Daniel is shaken to the core, knowing that his real brother is dead this is the only moment where you really see Daniel in a vulnerable state, his real family is dead and gone, and his only family is a phony act that Daniel orchestrated.<br /><br />Another major conflict in There Will Be Blood is the slow burning rivalry between Daniel and Eli Sunday, the towns local priest who rival's Daniel in his taste for money and power. Daniel and Eli both represent two opposing foundations of the United States; capitalism and religion. Daniel promises the gullible townsfolk that he'll be making everyone prospourous and rich, while Eli promises everyone that they'll be healed and receive salvation, both headstrong in their mission enough to warrant butting heads on more than one occasion, all the awhile keeping it under the noses of the townspeople.<br /><br />Eventually Daniel reaches an ultimatum from one of his prospective clients, that they'll allow him to run an oil line through their land only if he attends one of Eli's sermons and 'accepts salvation', in a great scene of Eli getting revenge on Daniel while giving the church audience a show. Daniel, in spite of bringing profit and wealth among the community, is finally confronted in front of an audience about all of his failings as a father and as a family man, triggered by his abandonment of H.W. and Henry's murder. Eli is much more enthusiastic about confronting Daniel's demons than Daniel, after Daniel threatened a union oilman's life for bringing up his family, he is left powerless due to the overwhelming number of church-goers following Eli's demands for salvation. Eli has won this round.<br /><br />Onto the final scene Daniel Plainview is woken from a liquor-fuel slumber by none other than Eli, who's apparently forgotten about the hard feelings from over a decade ago, but Daniel in his isolated alcoholic madness sure as hell hasn't, and Eli has walked right into the spider's web. Sobbing and begging for money, Eli reveals that he has gone broke and is desperate for another donation, while Daniel silently soaks up Eli's misery and despair until he erupts in a rage and bludgeons Eli to death. Daniel 'won' in a game where there are seemingly no winners.<br /><br />There are other aspects of There Will Be Blood to admire, the score itself by Johnny Greenwood punctuates the mood, creating memorable scenes, while the cinematography shows the yawning rural landscape, with all the open fields analogous with the vast potential for oil striking the United States was in at the time. There is no scene more breath-taking that I've ever seen then when H.W. is being carried away by Daniel while the oil is coming from the ground, the music, the acting, the scenery, it all molded together to what I would call the best scene of all time. When Daniel and Henry are setting the trail for the pipeline to run through the music is industrious and ambitious, and when the fifteen year time gap is shown through the melancholy violins sets the stage perfectly for the final act.<br /><br />Really I could go on and on about There Will Be Blood, this is an American classic that rewards repeat viewings, each viewing showing a subtlety in each character's behaviors, while still cloaking their true intentions and thoughts in mystery and speculation. This is not a movie for everybody, the story unfolds at a slow pace letting you get more involved in the world and despite the dumb horror movie title there is almost no blood, the violence isn't the focus of the movie, it's usually accidential and whenever there is bloodshed it's by the hands of our 'hero' Daniel Plainview. However those going in who have patience and searching for something unique will find a wholly unique and engrossing experience, going into one man's heart of darkness in the boom of the oil rise.ligion.

B008ALAHA4|4.0|After reading the previous review about this product that stated:<br /><br />\\"If you're using this with one of the new (2012) Macbooks, it won't quite work as advertised. It can charge the battery. Or it can power the computer. But, it can't do both at the same time.\\"<br /><br />I CAN 100% STATE THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE! Whatever Apple Tech said that was incorrect!<br /><br />For reference, I just received my new 2012 MacBook Air and my MagSafe 1 to 2 adapter, connected it to my older 85 watt MacBook Pro power supply, and while the MBA is on I can clearly see that it is charging in he menu bar - so again this adapter works just as one would think it would with no issues as previously described. So again you can easily use your older MagSafe 1 power adapters and there is no need to buy a 2nd extra charger.<br /><br />However, I do find it annoying to now have to carry around yet another easily losable adapter in my bag. However, when needed this little $10 adapter will allow me to power up my MBA using any older style MagSafe 1 power supply which is a useful option to have when needed. Oddly size wise when compared to the older 2011 MBA MagSafe connector they look essentially the same, so I guess the smaller size (?) bits are for the inside of the MBA as opposed to being viewable on the outside.<br /><br />One last thing of note regarding the new MBA power adapter. Oddly Apple has now gone back to the original style little square MagSafe style connecter instead of using the 2009/2010/2011  L-shaped MagSafe cylinder like connector. While it's handy as you can connect it in any direction, I have to wonder about the old 'strain relief' issues they had with this older style connector and how or what they have changed in order to make this work better? I guess time will tell.<br /><br />Hope that helps the cause...
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I am stunned by just how awful this book is. Girl With the Dragon Tattoo had many disturbing elements, but was so intriguing and brilliantly written. This is just junk.

B00007LTIA|5.0|This review is not about the music, if you want to hear snippets to see if you like it, try youtube.  This will not help though, there are lovely melodic parts that will charm and mislead you, there are cacophonies that will have you move on.<br /><br />If you are browsing and thinking of buying this but don't have much spare time, don't bother, you will struggle and give it a 1 star review having wasted your money.<br /><br />If however you want to find a piece/s of music that will reward you, that will be more than 3 minutes of fluff, then buy it.  Listen to the the first track and the last track endlessly.  When you have grown to like and understood what they are about musically not lyrically then try the second track.  This way you will get into it quicker.<br /><br />The third track in my experience is the most difficult, less melodic maybe, but as rewarding as the others when it clicks.<br /><br />I cannot remember exactly when I first heard TFTO but it does take a lot of sustained effort on behalf of the listener to get.<br /><br />I got this when I was about 19 (49 now) and even used to have it on when revising for exams, when you like it it becomes so familiar, rewarding, enjoyable, and something you will return to time and time again.<br /><br />Forget all the hype about prog-overload.

0142420891|4.0|I don't know why I have continued to push off reading this book for so long. I've been wanting to dig into it for a while, but I always choose another book over it. Why? But now that I have read it, I'm so glad I finally did. To get the second part to an amazing story!<br /><br />With 'If I Stay', you are in the POV of Mia and in Where She Went you are in the POV of Adam. I absolutely loved that. I loved how we got to see the way Adam feels and felt. I also like how it flips back and fourth from present to past. It was an amazing thing. In this book, we go through, yet again, and emotional roller coaster. It was a painful thing to see what Adam's inner self has been going through over the last three years.<br /><br />In 'If I Stay' I cried my eyes out, but I didn't in this book. The emotions where there in this book but in a different way. I didn't really understand why Adam blamed himself so much for the promise he made. And I really didn't understand Mia's logic to be honest. I did, but I didn't.<br /><br />The character development in this book was amazing. But that is to be expected since this story is picks up three years later. It's amazing how this book takes place over a 24 hr period. Just one day changed the way both Adam and Mia lived their lives.<br /><br />The ending to this story left me feeling... :D I loved how things turned out and it ease my heart :) If you have not read If I Stay, I highly recommend that you do and if you have read, but have not read this book yet, I high recommend that you too!<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed part two to Mia and Adam's story. It was an emotional journey that leaves you thinking once you finish both books.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I loved this book, it made me smile, it made me cry, and most importantly it made me step back from day to day life and really think about what matters and about the future. I recommend this book to people with and without family history of Alzheimer's.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is great although it can take you awhile to save up money to buy items. It is free but the makers of the game make it kind of hard to recieve acorns ( a type of currency) so you will supposedly want to buy more acorns for the game with real money.
B005H9B44A|2.0|I could not rent this movie and had to buy it (right after Avengers of course).  Unfortunately it was not offered in HD and a month later it's on Netflix instant in HD.  Oh yeah the movie is just average.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|As a long time POTO fan and any thing else Anderw Llyod Weeber , I was somewhat disappointed, the middle of Act One drags on forever and at times the staging is a tad over the top and it takes away from the music. Act 2 is far better than the first one. I strongly dislike Ben Lewis as the Phantom he makes the Phantom very hard to watch becuase of his bizzer facial expressions that are laughable. He is not the typical sexy phantom such as Ramin in the 25 th Annvisery POTO. The rest of the cast is spot on and very enjoyable.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It's funny I just looked at this a few days ago.  The reviews here that are negative are for an old version that just got updated.<br /><br />The new version works great, looks good, and has a lot of features.  I hope the dev doesn't abandon this app on Amazon now that it went faotd.  If that happens I will drop my review here and on the other market.
0062112430|4.0|I read this book when it first came out and enjoyed it. Oliver is a very good writer and storyteller. The story can seem a bit slow and a bit repetitive at times, but the overall idea and thought behind the story is fascinating. I finished the book and thought about it for a long time afterward, which is something a lot of books fail to do. This is not a fast paced \\"read it and be done\\" book. It's a thoughtful, painstakingly told story that will draw you into the world the author has created.

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|We use this mic for the How-To videos shown on our blog. The sound is really much better than what you'd get from an onboard mic. We use both the Canon S95 [[ASIN:B003ZSHNGS Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD]] (excellent sound from the camera, but not once the cam is moved farther out), and the Canon HV20. Especially on the HV20 [[ASIN:B000MUV6BA Canon HV20 3MP High Definition MiniDV Camcorder with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom]] the mic will pick-up camera sound. For example, when you move the zoom in or out it can pick up noise; ditto for the the S95.<br /><br />Two caveats: Remember the switch the power off when you're done, or you'll be left in the cold next time you want to use it. Also, while the mic has a very long cord, it can be crazy-making if you do have to move around during the recording. Especially when you making recordings without someone else's help, this mean you have to walk to the camera and lights to make adjustments etc. In one of my videos I actually cursed under my breath, wishing I had a Sennheiser wireless set-up [[ASIN:B002CWQTXG Sennheiser EW112PG3-A Camera Mount Wireless Lavalier Microphone System]]. One of these days...!
B001LF3YQK|1.0|This wipe case doesn't stay closed and when it is closed it has a large gap so the wipes dry out very quickly.  The red slider is very difficult to open so you have to brace the case with one hand while using your other hand to slide it.  This is very difficult to do when you're trying to change a wiggly baby. Also, the hinge broke within days after I bought it. This case sucks.  Don't buy it.

0099579936|1.0|I am so glad that I did not have to pay to read these novels. The heroine, Anastasia Steele, is astonishingly inarticulate, relying on favorite phrases such as \\"holy c**\\", holy s***\\", double c***\\", etc. to express her reactions to just about every situation. For a 21-year-old college graduate with a 4.0 GPA and acknowledged by one and all in the novel as intelligent, Ms. Steele is remarkably sophomoric and fatuous. Yes, the author takes pains to tell the reader how inexperienced and unworldly she is (and, supposedly, therein lies her charm) but the character is such an ingénue that it seems she has escaped from the pages of a badly-written romance novel of an earlier era. Let's see... now onto our hero - Christian Grey. He has grey eyes, occasionally `scorching' grey eyes, wears a grey suit, has a grey stare (oh, and let's not forget his infamous \\"tortuous\\" grey tie).  Yes, yes--we get it.  He is a handsome billionaire -- so commonplace, nowadays (ho-hum) -- with `expensive and absorbing hobbies' all of which he is expert at and, of course, a dark and fifty shades of grey side. Before long, they have sex; she signs a contract to become his submissive and gets to play in his playroom - a sado-maschosist's dream. I wonder how the women who give this book 5 stars would have rated it if E.L. James turned out to be the pseudonym for a male author. Would they have derided it as anti-female, pornographic, sexism?  How does having it written by a woman, ostensibly for a female audience, give this book some sort of investiture as a guide for the emancipated female. The thought that any woman could be inspired by the more than accommodating \\"heroine\\" is disturbing on so many levels.  Yes, this is a fantasy tale but, as in all fantasies, much of the appeal of such stories lies in innate desires that are rarely expressed. Does this mean that the positive reviewers secretly long for bondage and sado-masochistic relationships? And, if that is the case, more power to you--consenting adults and all that. I guess my main argument against this book isn't so much about its' sexual politics which is open to interpretation. I have read erotica in the past and enjoyed it, but this book's sex scenes become so formulaic, unimaginative and repetitive that they lose all eroticism. It's amazing that, considering all the different kinky sex they have, the author made it all such a bore. After a while, the novelty wore thin and as soon as either main character began to express a desire to have sex, I found myself skipping over the \\"sexy\\" parts hoping that a plot of some sort would materialize (which eventually does in the next installments of the trilogy). I know some reviewers argue that the value of these books lie in the journey of self-discovery and self-affirmation that the heroine and hero take, and that the sado-masochistic, bondage and torture aspect is just a little frisson on the side of the entrée to spice things up.  Unfortunately, for me, the side dish took up way too much of the meal. And, the worst part was that it wasn't even a good meal. The novels read like the fantasies of a teenager who is writing about her \\"crush\\"-the cutest, smartest, richest guy in her school. The writing is so vapid and immature that it was almost painful for me to read at times. Hmm...perhaps that was part of the sado-masochistic aspect of the novel--not only did the heroine subject herself to pain but I, as a reader, did so as well. I read the novels thinking that with so much good buzz about them I would be reading some good erotic literature. Alas, that was not the case. My advice to those who are interested is to save your money and borrow them from the library or from a friend who has already bought them. Don't waste your money.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Having assumed all the negative press was on the mark, I rented a DVD of Carter at our local grocery for .99--and was pleasantly surprised to find this was a fun adventure movie.  My wife and I had only recently watched the two seasons of Rome and were delight to see Caesar and Mark Anthony reappear on Mars in something close to their same roles. The physics was nonsense, of course, but the actual pace and complexity of the story was measured and as good as any classic western.  Carter, the movie, has been given a bad rap.  It ought rightly to capture more of the attention it deserves--just for being a well-spun yarn.<br /><br />If the movie had weak points (Ok, maybe Taylor Kitsh was a little under-dimensional--but even that worked), they were nothing to the critics who gave it an eager thumbs down and the seeming frightened old women shuffling the deck at Disney.

Sounds like a great idea, and there have been many attempts to do just this.  Flipboard does it near perfectly.  The layout and scrolling is easy to use, looks good, can link into a host of social network accounts.  If you prefer to add in your own favorite web media outlets and social networks, rather than using the canned categories Flipboard offers, you're welcome to do a search and add it to your flipboard.  Performance is very good, though I have come across several instances where Flipboard doesn't update stories to the most recent, even when manually telling it to refresh. Another bit of greatness is that Flipboard will sync your settings across devices.  So, if like me, you use both phone and tablet, you only need to set up one device and any changes you make on either device will carry over to the other.<br /><br />On the down side, controlling Flipboard, changing its settings, isn't nearly as easy as it should be, IMHO.  As I stated in the title of this review, Flipboard isn't intuitive at all when it comes to changing settings, or adding/removing content.  Options for settings is particularly sparse.  What is the refresh interval and how do I change it?  Why can't I get rid of the cover story section?  What if I don't want all my devices to be pulling the same articles?  Why can't I create my own categories or modify the current ones?<br /><br />Even with the issues mentioned, Flipboard does a very good job over all.  Easily the best looking app of its type.<br /><br />*Note: Apps can get updates and change over time, for better or worse.

Having dug into several dozen, I can say that not one of them is perfect, each lacking something here or there, some feature(s) that another one has, isn't as easy to use, etc.  Though I keep two different editors installed, my default goto editor has been [[ASIN:B004OZK9VW PicSay Pro]], which is what I'll be using as a comparison in this review.  In terms of cost, PicShop and PicSay Pro are pretty close, with just a dollar separating them.  Both have free trial versions, so you can have a chance to check them out before plopping down your cash.<br /><br />As expected, I found a lot of things with PicShop that weren't up to the caliber of PicSay Pro, and PicSay Pro lacked some of the features of PicShop.  You can share right from your gallery into PicSay Pro, but not PicShop.  Exporting pictures is quite limited with PicShop, with only exporting to your device, Twitter, or Facebook.  PicSay Pro on the other hand can also export to anything you can normally share to on your device, plus set as image for a contact or set as your wallpaper.  PicSay Pro also lets you save the image locally where you want and under any name you want, while PicShop saves in the same location as the original photo under whatever name it chooses.  It's not all bad for PicShop though.  It can save in more formats automatically, upscaling your image on its own when needed.  Resaving an edited image results in a new file with a new name, so the original isn't overwritten.  In PicSay Pro, you have to set the new name manually.  Filters, effects, and additional features again goes it PicSay Pro, which has a much larger set of these.  PicShop fights back though with the ability to layer images, and use frames on your final output.  The UI for both apps is pretty easy to use, though they differ significantly.  PicShop may win this argument by a smidgen, because of it's larger buttons, sliders, and filter previews.<br /><br />So far, not a single issue with performance of PicShop.  It worked well, and at my slightest touch.  Stability has been excellent as well.  While I'm not ready to give up on PicSay Pro, I'll be keeping PicShop around as my new backup editor.<br /><br />*Note: Apps can get updates and change over time, for better or worse.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album is beyond good.  Buy it, study it, treasure it.  I waited to write this review until I could absorb what I was hearing over several listens - and then several more.  It's startling to think how long I've been a Rush fan at this point, so I won't dwell on it.  But long enough to have been an early adopter of the majority of the band's catalog.  If there's one thing you learn being a Rush fan it's that your first impressions are never correct, especially if you're writing off whatever you are hearing as lazy or unformed.  These are 3 of the most intelligent people in modern music, and they don't take their music lightly.  So chances are that if you're not getting it, it's most likely because there's too much IT to get in a casual or early listen.  However, I didn't really have that issue in a first run through CA because the sound of this record is so mighty there's no way any human with a pulse could not have a visceral reaction (provided the means of delivery isn't some sort of tinny iPod ear nubs).  Rush is in the house - in your house at max power.<br /><br />But in a way, that's a problem.  When somebody grabs you by the throat and yells in your face, you aren't exactly prepared to contemplate the subtle nuances of whatever they might be saying.  In other words, it's an amazing sonic experience, with peerless musicianship and incredible production, but does that mean the songs are any good?  And actually, beneath the atomic resonance of the sonic tidal wave, these are some of the band's catchiest tunes ever.  I didn't even realize it until I found myself looking forward to singing along with choruses and bridges.  \\"All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary...\\"  \\"I can't stop thinking big...\\"  \\"Distant as a comet or a constellation...\\"  I could go on and on.  Just a master class of subtle tunecraft in an era that has forgotten melody ever walked the earth.<br /><br />This is also a very nice PRODUCT.  The booklet is gorgeous.  It's been a long time since I bought an album that also felt like an artifact worthy to be unearthed by future archeologists.  Along with the music you get the feeling that this might be the first ALBUM to be made since OK Computer - that is, this is a piece of art which can only be understood and appreciated as a totality, with the booklet and lyrics an indispensable part of the whole.  Nobody does that anymore.  It defies the iPod shuffle, but if a listener can't spin the circle on something that jostles his innards then there's no way he will ever get the impact of the music no matter how he slices it.<br /><br />All in all, I get the feeling that this album is a tribute to the fans - not just the Rush fans, but fans of music.  By making something that dares to be distinctive, in the vertical plane of modern music and in the long horizontal of Rush history (which is now a large chunk of hard rock history), Rush proves that they care - they care about their music, they care about their fans, they care about remaining vital in a world that has only recently started to even acknowledge their existence.  That's not just a testament to the band and its fans, its an inspiration we can all draw from.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game has kept me entertained for hours. It has a ton of levels with great power ups. Even though there is potential for in game purchases, you can win everything you can buy, so you don't have to spend any more money to enjoy all of the games features. Overall this is a great game.
0345803485|4.0|I read some other people's reviews and had to agree to a point. I kept buying the next book and about half way through the second one, I was hooked.  I admit before purchasing, I didn't have a clue about all the sex, I know - how could that happen?  This man who has everything but mental health meets girl who gently leads him to his full potential as a man.  It's the best love story!  One of my favorite parts are the emails between the two of them.  I miss Ana and Christian!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|First time hearing Metallica was the S&M album and so when I heard them without the Orchestra I was a little thrown off. Needless to say I like the either way. But S&M will always be my favorite. Great DVD.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|I enjoyed the film and I think just anyone can learn from what you will see. The film does a good job at explaining the role of Washington to Wall Street. It is worth the 90-minute investment.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko was supposed to be like Archie Bunker. He was supposed to be the guy who got completely exposed as being the person you should not try to emulate. Instead of vilifying Gekko, Wall Street cloned him. This is not capitalism, this is pure greed. I learned in school that capitalism is a system where you to try to make a product to see if you can make a profit. These greedy fat cats made nothing except large bets with other people's money. Luckily, I graduated from college before these professors were bought out by Wall Street and Congress. Inside Job does a nice job of showing how this corruption even gets into our higher education system.<br /><br />The film does a very good job to explain how these financial institutions became too big to fail. It cannot tell the whole story because no book or film can. The reason for this is that the bigshots that caused this would rather die than reveal how they cheated the global economy.<br /><br />The film does have a leftist slant to it with interviews with people like George Soros, Barney Frank and Eliot Spitzer. We could have done without Soros, that guy has an agenda as big as you will ever see. Frank knows he is no innocent man when it comes to this and how his relationship with Fannie Mae helped inflate the balloon. You almost feel for Spitzer because you remember how good he was at bringing some of these greedy pigs down. But, you cannot forget the old adage that it takes a lifetime to earn a reputation and a minute to destroy it. While many on Wall Street were doing the same indiscretions as Spitzer, they were not in public office while doing them.<br /><br />I bet Mr. Ferguson wishes he could remove the segment with Dominique Strauss-Kahn (DSK). He was in on it just like so many.<br /><br />You will see in the film how much of a joke the financial ratings system became. Everything was AAA rated. You will see representatives from Standard & Poor's and Moody's crumble in front of Congress. Those people said, \\"Our rating is just an opinion.\\" That opinion is worth billions to investors. Those agencies may have been the biggest frauds.<br /><br />Old fashioned liberals, the old \\"party of the people\\", became just as greedy as they too joined in on the riches. Pelosi, Shalaha, Dodd, Clyburn, Boxer, and countless others from Fannie Mae got VIP loans from Countrywide as a \\"Friend of Angelo Mozilo.\\" This was not mentioned in the film, but it is fact. Feel free to google that line in quotes. If you saw the Michael Moore film, \\"Capitalism\\", you will see Chris Dodd<br /><br />And hey, how about Glenn Hubbard, what a bag of garbage  he is. Great job exposing that weasel. You could see him sweat and think to himself, \\"Oh my God, they are on to us!\\"<br /><br />It truly will not matter who we vote for until we throw the garbage out and have actual regulation against lobbying, and increased regulation on gambling on Wall Street.<br /><br />The 2012 election will be a battle fought not with action but with enormous amounts of cash. This election could have each side spending over a billion. It is nauseating. The saddest part of it all is that it will not really make a difference if Gov. Romney or President Obama is at 1600 Pennsylvania on January 20, 2013. Both men will have so many greasy palms to repay that they will not have time to care about the little people.<br /><br />Term limits should not be just for the President, it should be for all of Congress. One should not be able to make a career out of being a professional politician. Ten years and then find something else to do.<br /><br />The Democrats don't care about the people anymore, they care about their wallets. At least with Republicans you kind of get the idea that they really do not care too much about the bottom, they don't try to pretend like they do. Both are wrong. It made me remember back in 1992 when Reform party candidate Ross Perot had both parties shaking in their boots. Sadly, Perot was a bit of a nut job and made the tragic mistake of quitting. But, you wonder why we haven't had any other third or fourth party candidate come forward and challenge this oligarchy. The answer is they don't have the cash to join the bash. Just like Wall Street and some other places, the better the greenery, the better the scenery.<br /><br />Underneath the Great Seal should be a sign that says paid for by Goldman Sachs.<br /><br />What should really enrage every American is that none of these Gekko clones went to jail. Only a select few are even standing trial. Dick Fuld, Angelo Mozilo (voted worst CEO ever), Jon Corzine (MF Global's disaster came after the film), and so many others who were in the boardrooms got away with mass destruction. Iraq may not have had weapons of mass destruction, but a good number of them were in our backyard.<br /><br />So many jobs were lost and so many lives were ruined because of the actions of these greedy pigs, and nobody got caught and most got to keep their dirty money.<br /><br />If you began being a bookie on a local street corner taking $20 bets on sports and were caught you would go to jail for running an illegal gambling business. The sad part you would pay out to any player any bets you lost on because that is the right thing to do. The only thing you did wrong was not bribing Congress beforehand.<br /><br />At the end of the film, you feel kind of hopeless for our economy. The economy and the working people are the tragic figures of the film. Hardly any new regulations have come into effect. The fact that so few got punished does not make you think it can happen again, it makes you believe that it will happen again and that the people we vote to protect our rights are not protecting us; they are jumping into bed with them.
1853260231|4.0|Wow. How did I reach the age of 43 without realising \\"Frankenstein\\" is so much more than a one-dimensional horror story about a blockheaded monster with bolts in his neck? The \\"fiend\\" reads poetry, longs for companionship, admires kindness and gentleness. Is he evil, or just lonely and misunderstood? Either way, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If she says \\" inner goddess\\" one more time I might go crazy. Poor character development. A supposedly klutzy woman suddenly transformed into a \\"beguiling\\" creature with no explanation. Sex parts read like \\"Penthouse Forum\\". All the same after a while. Repetetive wording. Seriously, no one looks goid when they bite their lip!
B007D2XSW0|3.0|This seems to be a nice photo editor. The lines are clean and the UI is understandable and doesn't require too much digging in order to understand how to use each feature. As stated by others, there are features lacking, but it generally covers the usual gamut of processing effects. I do think that the ability to share completed photos should be expanded some, but I can certainly go to my gallery in order to share.<br />* The &quot;sticky intents&quot; permission is, however, a definite point of concern for me. Is not as if I fear everyone (apps) will divulge my family secrets, but the fact that this info is persistent on my phone and that it *could* be shared is what bothers me. I really do not feel that this permission is (ever) necessary, even for troubleshooting purposes.*<br />For this reason I will end up removing it from my phone and only rate it 3 stars - without the permission it stays and is 4 or 5 stars even.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|As indicated below, this is an outdated version, PlayStore has working new version. I don't blame the app, I blame Amazon. Do not buy anything from Amazon Apps, careful even with free stuff. I purchased a different app here but has been updated 5 times already in PlayStore but not here. Avoid Amazon, even for free App. But why? Its free you ask. Because if there is a major problem like a security issue, you will never get the update.

B000W91RUG|5.0|At the time I'm writing this, Big Bang Theory has been on for five seasons. Despite the fact that one of my best friends raved about the show, I never watched it. When I went to the UK, I noticed that Big Bang Theory was on ALL THE TIME. I was hungry for a show with American accents (British accents.. they're lovely, but you long for home after awhile!), and I ended up getting hooked on Big Bang Theory. When I got back home, I ordered the dvd, and I keep falling in love with the show. It's laugh out loud funny, and this is coming from someone who rarely ever laughs out loud. If you haven't started watching this show yet, I can't recommend it enough.
B003O86FMW|4.0|as the second of the trilogy - much builds up in this book.  It still has the quick pace and seeming tunnel vision / impression from Catnis' perspective.  Primarily the build up of tension to the potential of upheaval in Panam is the focus and on that the bood delivers.  A fun and quick read!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|DroidX, it works fine. I will have fun with it. The pictures save to your gallery if you just hit 'save' button again not fb or twitter offered to the right of it.
B000MPEIF6|4.0|I've recently sat to watch for the first time all of the resident evil series.  It's no wonder that people love the movies, there's enough suspense, campy undead, action, feminine vulnerability coupled with a kickass attitude for most people who like a movie to entertain them.  As they series progresses, so does the development of Alice's character.  Yet in this first installemnt - I can appreciate the initial concept and the \\"coming into oneself\\" aspet of who Alice is.<br /><br />A very fun movie.
0553386794|5.0|My colleage told me about this book and TV series and let me borrow his paper back since he had finished the complete series himself.  (All 5 that have come out so far)  I could not put the book down and had finished this long novel within 2 weeks staying up until well past my normal bed time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel to anyone looking to get into a series.  Just make sure you have the next week or two open.  You'll be hooked.

0307594165|4.0|Home is beautifully written. I haven't read any Toni Morrison in a long time, and was blown away at my return. It was a quick read (for one not interrupted by family for a change). Evocative is the best word for it.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine Ms. Morrison living in New York when she can write so very well about the country. Southern country. This is poetic writing. Very real and yet beautifully told.<br /><br />I would have loved for it to be longer, but I also enjoyed it for making a beautiful afternoon.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much. See for yourself. I recommend it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have no idea why all of these reviews are so terrible. I got this app on my Kindle Fire and I think its GREAT!!!
0439023513|4.0|Okay, so I was bored by the fighting in this book. Yet, I was also amazed that Collins is not squeamish with her characters. Through out the entire Trilogy, the characters are real, have flaws, have doubts. The political punch is cynical of power--nearly becoming a primer for a wilderness anarchism that you might find if you combined Ed Abbey with Isaac Asimov. The ending is satisfying although a bit predictable. Yet, as with the entire trilogy, I couldn't put them down. They provoke excellent conversation regarding the themes of political power, wilderness and technology. The books are disturbing. A Teenaged Mad Max world.<br /><br />And one more thing: Why does Collins hate dogs? In the ever intense debate amongst cat lovers and dog lovers sort of like the whole Gale versus Peeta thing, or Team Jacob versus that other Twilight Dude--Collins sides with cats. The name Katniss is quite obvious. I've seen no other Teenager book where dogs are actually hunted and eaten.?! And what about those Muttations? Collins loves cats--certainly not dogs.
B007KAJG3K|1.0|I loved this movie, but am upset that the UltraViolet copy can only be watched on my computer. I did create my flixster account, then downloaded some flixster app onto my laptop so I could get my digital copy. However, I can only watch it on my computer. I need this digital copy in my itunes so I can put it on my ipod (it's an 80GB ipod classic), and although it is downloaded to my computer, it can only be accessed through the Flixster app which does not let you move it to the desktop or itunes.<br /><br />I contacted customer support and they told me to download the Flixster app to my iphone or Android. I replied that I don't have an ipod that has apps, so I needed to know how to get it into itunes. Their response was \\"sorry for the inconvenience.\\"<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that this is not a true digital copy that I can watch while traveling.
0439023491|4.0|Books for teens certainly have changed since I was a teenie-bopper some 40 years ago. This is much more adult, more gruesome, more macrabe, certainly more pessismistic. This book doesn't disappoint but it is also the nature of the second book in a trilogy to be much like sitting in a waiting room of a Doctor's office. Things happen but they aren't resolved. The wilderness theme isn't as powerful in this book. Yet, I loved it.
1936608898|5.0|Having been a passionate advocate for the power of food for the last 15 years (initially the Zone diet now Paleo, or as I like to think a species appropriate diet), the book title itself is enough to get me salivating.<br /><br />It Starts With Food is AMAZING! Go read it.<br /><br />Let me tell you why I love this book.<br /><br />First, I am a nutritionist, and from this perspective I see this book as an exceptional tool for teaching people about nutrition (specifically nutrition that will change lives) in a way that is  easy to understand and doable. Added to that, this book would inspire just about anyone to change their diet.<br /><br />Dallas and Melissa really got my attention from this bolded statement in Chapter 2:<br /><br />\\"We are far more concerned with health than we are about history.\\"<br /><br />YES! Isn't this why many of us became so enthusiastic  about `Paleo' in the first place? NOT because we somehow felt good recreating a `caveman' diet. NO - we love paleo because of how it makes us feel, and how it changed our health. It's not eating a `caveman diet' that worked, it is eating a human species appropriate diet, with its multiple health benefits.<br /><br />How did It Starts With Food's Whole30 eating template get designed? \\"We combined scientific research with clinical experience\\" This is why the information in this book is so good, Melissa and Dallas have worked with thousands of real people; they understand the  science of nutrition and how to apply it. They get how nutrition works for people both physiologically and psychologically, which in my experience, only comes from working with many people putting a diet plan into practice over time.<br /><br />How does food affect your body? Dallas and Melissa answer this question with simple yet scientifically accurate explanations, examples and interesting analogies. What I particularly love are the distinctions used to decide whether a particular food is healthful to eat. These are called `Our goodfood standards'.<br /><br />The food we eat should:<br /><br />  Promote a healthy psychological response<br />  Promote a healthy hormonal response<br />  Support a healthy gut<br />  Support immune function and minimize inflammation<br /><br />If we look at all the food we eat through this lens, it is very hard to see where one could go wrong when deciding whether or not a food is healthful for us as a human animal, and, as well a human individual. There are foods that none of us should eat as a species, however as individuals we each have different tolerances, and Achilles heels psychologically.<br /><br />I particularly like chapter 4 \\"Your brain on food\\". This explains brilliantly how modern processed foods are designed to maximally light up ancient reward centres in our brain, the ones that help us decide that a food will be safe and good for us to eat. By lighting up this reward centre, modern processed foods trick us into believing they are good for us, even when they are not. (IMO many food manufacturers have zero interest in our health, they are only interested in making money without acutely poisoning us)<br /><br />I can't think of anything this book leaves out. Chapter 5 covers the effect of food (and to some extent) lifestyle on hormones; insulin, glucagon, leptin and cortisol. Chapter 6 explains digestion and leaky gut, the importance of gut bacteria and how to maintain a healthy gut. Chapter 7 covers inflammation, particularly silent inflammation, the one you can't feel, but can lead to a slow health degradation, and how diet contributes to this. Chapter 12 covers auto-immune disease.<br /><br />Then we get to actual food, and how each food on the Whole30 is chosen. Each  food we are to cut out has its effect on our body detailed using the four `good food standards'. This concept is brilliantly simple and simply brilliant when applied to choosing foods. All the usual problem foods are covered; sweet stuff, bad oils, intoxicating stuff (alcohol), grains, legumes and dairy.<br /><br />What you should eat and why, and importantly how much - is all covered from chapters 13 to 15, with answers to all questions that might jump into your mind as you go along. eg. `But what about cholesterol?' Answered. `What about saturated fat?' `Coffee?' Answered.<br /><br />The Whole30, the strict, yet powerful 30 day elimination plan is explained in chapter 17 and 18. Chapter 21 shows how to fine tune this if you are a special case - you might have autoimmune disease, diabetes, or are an athlete or vegetarian.<br /><br />Once you have finished your 30 day elimination, there are guidelines on how to add in foods and test them, and (very important) strategies for long-term success (Chapters 19 & 20)<br /><br />Supplements are covered in chapter 22,. Lots of meal and food preparation ideas and recipes, plus a list of resources is in the appendix.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with \\"It Starts With Food\\". It is thorough and sound, both the science and the practice of eating a diet that just might change your life in unexpected ways.

B007D2XSW0|1.0|decided to try this app despite the negative reviews it had. Im not gonna bash the app, but i will say it does not work on my phone. i can get to my gallery to select a picture but when i do nothing happens. i cant even share the photo to this app through my gallery. Hopefully either the dev or amazon get this app up to date.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Superb.  The app does just as it says.  You choose the type of device and then select the pictures off your phone that you want to send and they are waiting for you on the other device at the designated webpage.  I always forget to go grab the cable and transfer the files from my phone; but, this makes it so simple to transfer a pic whenever I need it without the added hassle of digging through my bag to look for my sync cable.  I know that sounds lazy, but how many times have you done the same thing and said, \\"I'll just transfer them all later\\" then six months later you've got 2 GB of pictures bogging down your smartphone.  It's totally worth the money.

B00000J7SS|5.0|Yes, other reviewers are correct. It takes a few listens to get it, especially Disc 1. This album is a different style of Miles, a more \\"plugged in\\" sound than most of his previous material. While I probably wouldn't have started the album with \\"Pharaoh's Dance\\",  Bitches Brew's complexity and surreal rhythms make it a classic.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This game gives a lot of options. for level of play and type of game.  very enjoyable<br /> game for all skill levels
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie and portrayal of the Navy Seals who are Navy Seals is beyond awesome! How clueless we are as a nation of what these heroes and other heroes in the military give to protect this nation on a daily basis. The only thought that went though my head as I watched this movie is that a commie, Marxist, street organizer - who bows down to every world leader he meets and who can give a rat can about this nation and its founding is in charge of these dear and beloved brave men. God bless the heroes of the NSSF.<br /><br />Make your kids watch this movie so they know what true heroes are.

0553386794|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire: A Game of Thrones<br /> \\"When you play the game of thrones, either you win or you die. There is no middle ground\\" (Martin 448).  This quote from George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones captures the essence of the fantasy novel. Martin creates a medieval world that falls into turmoil after the death of King Robert Baratheon and features feuding families, fire-breathing dragons, and the mysterious \\"white walkers\\" who live beyond The Wall. Martin uses a complex setting, magical plot elements, and well-developed characters to bring the reader's into his world and creates an excellent fantasy novel in the process.<br /> Martin is able to create a setting so complex, it features an entirely fictional continent that the reader can't help but want to explore. He uses the experiences of the characters to introduce detailed locations. The audience journeys from The Wall cuts across the snowy North, to the lush, Mediterranean-like Riverlands of The South. Martin's descriptions can make you feel a shiver with Jon as \\"the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens\\" (115), or feel the rain as \\"...it beat down on Ned's head, warm as blood and relentless as old guilt's\\" (367).<br />Martin is able to weave in fantastical elements that make sense to the story while thrilling his audience. As the novel opens, the reader travels with rangers of the Knight's Watch who are exploring the other side of The Wall, and encounter the Others, a supernatural race who are thought to be extinct. Martin leaves you on the edge of your seat as the rangers are killed and turned into zombie-like creatures. Martin leaves you breathless at the end of the novel as the beloved character Daenerys walks into a burning fire, only to emerge with three newly hatched dragons.<br /> Martin also creates well-developed characters that do not always fit into a typical `good vs. evil' paradigm. For example, the audience first identifies Lord Eddard Stark as a loving family man, but is confused when it is revealed that he had an affair and brings home the love child. Lord Stark is revealed to the audience as a brave leader, but later reveals that he has killed innocent people and burned cities to the ground. It is characters like these that make it hard for the audience to have just one opinion of Martin's characters; they are seen as complex people who are put in extraordinary circumstances, and allows the audience to engage in reflecting what makes a person `good' or `bad'.<br /> The world that George R. R. Martin creates in A Game of Thrones invites his readers in and challenges them to think beyond `good vs. evil'. Martin paints descriptive pictures and allows his audience to explore the terrain with his characters. He combines medieval courts with fantasy elements such as dragons and zombies. Martin creates characters that have human flaws that make them relatable even in such a fantastic setting. A Game of Thrones is an epic fantasy novel.<br /><br />Works Cited<br />Martin, George R. R.

B003MQNENY|5.0|I found a recommendation for this book on Fr. Robert Barrone's \\"Word on Fire\\" blog. I had avoided it because I thought the TV series was enough, but the book is infinitely more subtle and detailed. Also, Waugh takes every opportunity to embellish the narrative with his dry, slightly cynical wit. I will definitely re-read this at some point. It is certainly heavier and more serious than any of his other books that I have read, but the characterization alone makes it engrossing.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love this app. It is so easy and intuitive that anyone can get great results. Just follow the flow at the bottom of the screen and that's it. Great for experienced photographers and I beginner's alike.

B0055S348W|4.0|After ordering this app for my Droid X phone, I found it simple to install and use.<br /><br />When I turned on my phone's WiFi, this application discovered and properly identified all of the printers on my home network and automatically found a perfect driver match for one of them.  I printed photos, documents and text messages and all turned out okay.<br /><br />Then I went to my office and did the same thing.  Once again this application correctly identified all of the printers on my office network and found a matching driver for one of them.  I then printed a high-resolution color photograph from my phone wirelessly and was pleasantly surprised at the speed.<br /><br />One disappointing shortcoming is that this application prints email ONLY from the Google mail client, but not from the default mail client that came with my Droid X phone.  An email query I made to the company's support people was answered within a few hours and confirmed that they're still working on adding other Android mail clients to their printer service.<br /><br />When they do that this application will be considerably more useful to me.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one of the best reads in a very long time.... I would recommend this book to others. Great Job!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I really like Scalzi's books, but this one may be a personal favorite (Its a toss up with Zoe's Tale). It really hit close to home for me as a long time fan of the original Star Trek, but I think that you would enjoy this book even if you are only familiar with the show and not a big fan. I dont understand the criticisms that the story is superficial... because the humor is very clever, there are some pretty deep questions posed, and the relationships between the characters are meaningful and even got me choked up a few times. Great book.<br /><br />I think its pretty cool too that Scalzi has posted some of the one-star reviews on his blog, as an example to other writers that they cant please everyone and have to get comfortable with the idea/not take it personally when people slam them.<br /><br />John, please come to Dragoncon in Atlanta in Sept!
0345803485|2.0|I bought this book offline because everyone was raving about it, and I wanted to read it too. Honestly, I don't like it at all. I just stopped half way through the first book and I don't really want to read anymore. I understand that the book is erotica & that's great but it seems to be only about sunmissivness and I don't like it at all. It isn't written very well and for the first half of the book they dance around one certain subject. It is not appealing to me, and I don't like that it gives off the message or undertone that women should obey men, even if it is just in role playing. I'm all for exploring sexuality and having a fun time doing it, but this book is a one way street to only one kind of fantasy. I don't understand how this is inspiring women, just get to know yourself and being assertive and you don't need this book! Don't waste your money, I'm glad I didn't buy the triology.
1858705223|4.0|When Slash released his debut solo album in 2010 it featured a wide and diverse selection of artists from the like of Ozzy to Fergie, Lemmy to Adam Levine as well as spots for Nicole Scherzinger, it was an album that worked well and featured a standout track in \\"By The Sword\\" sung by Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother. The album also featured two songs by Alter Bridge frontman Myles Kennedy who would also go on to front Slash's group for his world tour during which he would sing songs from Slash's former bands as well as tracks from the album, so every night Kennedy would be filling the shoes of Axl Rose, Scott Weiland, Andrew Stockdale, Ian Astbury and Chris Cornell it was a job that he performed admiringly as his voice handled all the different ranges. So for Slash's second album Kennedy performs all the tracks, it seems like a natural progression and a working relationship has been built up by the two men.<br /><br />The album itself \\"Apocalyptic Love\\" is a rock fuelled funk filled adrenaline rush of old school rock and roll and it's clear from the outset that the album has one intention and that's to rock, it's an album full of great riffs such as the opening song the title track \\"Apocalyptic Love\\" with its funk driven riff that has Myles Kennedy using his full vocal range to drive the song on and features a great sing along chorus. \\"One Last Thrill\\" starts out with a scream in the background before Kennedy delivers the lyrics at 100 miles rate; it's a great piece of punk rock. It shows Kennedy has many different styles of vocals. It's also topped off by a trademark Slash solo. There's some great drumming and bass playing from Brent Fitz and Todd kerns on the song \\"Standing In The Sun\\", both Fitz and Kerns are part of slash's live band.<br /><br />The song \\"Anastasia\\" starts out with a gentle flamenco style acoustic guitar (think end of double talkin' jive) before kicking into a \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" riff and changes again and features a great solo from slash as well as Kennedy going from low to high with his vocal. \\"Bad Rain\\" has a pure rock swagger about it with its pounding drums and a grooving riff. The first single \\"You're A Lie\\" is a good indication of the album with its killer chorus and sleek guitar playing, it shows how much the Slash and Myles Kennedy partnership has grown.<br /><br />Just like Slash's debut solo album \\"Apocalyptic Love\\" comes as a special collector's edition packed along with a special edition of Classic Rock magazine, it contains a pin badge, poster and interviews with all band members, Slash and Myles also list their top 10 albums, there is also a look at Myles Kennedy's other band Alter Bridge. Slash's live Made In Stoke DVD also gets a behind the scenes look. More importantly it comes with two bonus tracks including the Aerosmithesque \\"Carolina\\" as well as \\"Crazy Life\\".<br /><br />Slash seems to have found his perfect frontman foil in Myles Kennedy and \\"Apocalyptic Love\\" is an unashamedly full blown rock album, one that owes much to Slash's 70's rock influences. It will be interesting to see where they go from here as the they continue to gel even more, Slash has stated in recent interviews that making the album was the most fun he's had in a long time and listening to the album its clear to hear the chemistry that they have
B005HSG3TC|2.0|The key word here is \\"lightweight\\" because it won't stay up. I am disappointed in this product and will go to a store in Alexandria and see if I can find something better! It starts out good but as you are using it, it slides out of the groove and eventually collapses down so that my Kindle is laying flat instead of being propped up! Now I just use it to protect my Kindle until I can get a different cover.

B001WCN23W|5.0|The first album released by the Stones in the 1970s, it's an album drenched in a sheen of perspiration.  Many of the tracks were conceived in the last 60s (Wild Horses, Brown Sugar) and as such, would fit right in on the previous Stones' album, Let It Bleed.  While that album oozed menace, this album seems to be mired in a drug-induced haze.  Known for its hits, the real gems are hidden like a junkie's last healthy vein.<br />The album kicks off with Brown Sugar, a song about interracial sex and cheap dope.  A classic, it captures the initial surge of energy that propels the Stones into the 70s.  Bobby Keys's sax adds an extra touch of raunchy sex appeal.  \\"Sway\\" is a yearning tune full of resignation to an inevitable descent into depression.  \\"Wild Horses\\" is cut from the same thematic cloth though it is far more famous.<br />\\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is a seven minute-plus song, a showcase for MIck Taylor's virtuoso guitar.  Keith Richards has stated that Ron Wood is his favorite co-guitarist but Taylor is the better musician.  The majority of the song is a jam between dueling guitars, two brothers of diverse personalities trying to outdo each other in front of the audience.  \\"You Gotta Move\\" is a nod to the blues masters the Stones revered (and from whom they pinched a tune or two... or three... or...).<br />\\"Bitch\\" opens Side B.  It's pace is quicker than Brown Sugar but while a good tune it lacks that extra bit of edge and bite that the album opener has.  \\"I Got the Blues\\" is a retreat back into that dark cave of weariness.  The lyrics express hope that one's former flame is now happy but Jagger's voice betrays this as a lie; he misses her and what he would do do have her back.  \\"Sister Morphine\\" is the bottom of the drug induced state; the singer's waiting for Death.<br />\\"Dead Flowers\\" is the hidden jewel of this album.  The lyrics reveal shame, an attempt to run from the light that would reveal the singer's addiction.  Hidden from daylight, from prying eyes of the upper crust of society, one can indulge in that blissful euphoria that the drug of choice provides.  There's a promise that the singer will outlive others and will be sure to be at their graves long after they're gone.<br />As melancholy as \\"Moonlight MIle\\" is, there's a glimmer of hope in it.  The lyrics indicate an partial emergence from the haze and at least offer the possibility that things will be better, if not then, than someday.<br />This is the Stones album you play when you're hanging on your back porch with your one or two friends or your lover, a beer or a glass of wine in your hand; the one you play as you drive down dark lonely roads as you travel through middle America; the one makes your pause and think about that girl that got away when you hear it in a pub on Thursday evening.<br />It's the one that lets you know that you've crawled through a mile of sewage and came out on the other side; dirty, sweaty, smelly, scarred.  But alive.

0099579936|1.0|As a 31 year old female, the portrayal of taboo and risqué sex for a couple in their 20's is so far off, it's laughable. The terminology was shit. The repetitiveness of ever time he \\"took her\\" was shit. I was expecting something gasp worthy. It is the middle aged woman who's never had anything besides missionary's version of what steamy is.
B006O99SYA|5.0|Midnight was the hour her platinum and diamond-encrusted watch stopped.  Hours later, in the cold of a January morning, her mutilated body was found at a site just a sort distance from her home, in an area superstitiously believed to harbor spirits.<br /><br />She was Pamela Werner, the twenty year old daughter of a retired British diplomat.  She was murdered in Peking in 1937. Her killers were never brought to justice.<br /><br />Paul French brings to this true crime story both a historian's willingness to tease out the facts from multiple obscure sources and a novelist's relish for enlivening the small details of time and place.  The result is a compelling and highly readable story of strangers in a strange land that tells us volumes about China before Japanese occupation, and what life was like in an expatriate community on the far side of the world.  Inhabited by those who left Western civilization behind, the world French presents is filled with colonialists, prigs, and desparate men and women, all of whose actions contributed to Pamela's murder and resulted in its never being solved.<br /><br />There is no Hollywood ending to this story, but there is resolution, through the single-minded work of Pamela's father, who turned the love for his daughter, his skills as a China hand, and his last resources toward unravelling the events that led to her murder.<br /><br />You will find this to be an absorbing tale.

B003CN4R74|5.0|This album received many complaints by fans. At first, I was baffled as to why. Going back I realized much of it might be a small issue that slipped my initial notice. I'll admit it, there is a negative stylistic influence, a slight touch of techno which has a varying influence throughout the CD. I can't quite put my finger on it but I do think there's something there. Some songs like \\"what you want\\" and \\"Oceans\\" are full of it, though the songs are not purely judged by it's presence (Oceans is great, What you Want it alright). Perhaps this is what turned so many listeners off, but I am confident in my belief that most songs are simply too AWESOME to be ruined by the touch of grime. Oceans and The Change are too great to be ruined by it; in fact, no song is bad, some just aren't great. Others, like the mighty My Heart is Broken are mostly clean of it, and Never Go Back has is mostly plagued by the guitars being a little bit lower pitch than they should be (another persistent problem of varying presence). And still, Never Go Back has such raw power to become the second or third best song on the album. Especially considering the low guitars are an issue with the already mediocre verses, but the song shines with fantastic choruses. Choruses are typically better than verses, I know, but I mean relativity even.<br /><br />Now, if there is anything that redeems the slight style problem it's the album's true masterpiece. Lost in Paradise has no stylistic problems, and a long list of strengths. The song has a wonderful polish to the style, fantastic violin AND piano, top notch vocals even for Amy, a great slow intro mixed well with a more intense body and a mind-blowing bridge that lets it defeat even the alternate version of My Immortal and take its place as my 8th favorite song. It's just so fantastic.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app allows you to open the photo to edit, then has a scroll bar along the bottom of the screen to move through and access the various features, such as cropping, adding &quot;stamps&quot;, etc.  I find this interface much easier to use than any of the other photo editors I have tried so far. It saves the photo back to the gallery you opened it from, and allows allows you to share it to FB right at the end. You also can choose to save the photo in various qualities depending on how you will use it, all the way up to saving it for printing.  This allows you to save space in your memory if you are just playing with a photo and don't intend to ever print it.<br />I do hope it will get the latest updates, but even without them this app worked flawlessly on my Asus Slider tablet running a rooted version of ICS.

0099579936|1.0|I just finished reading 50 Shades and plan on asking Amazon for my money back.  This book is ridiculous at best.  There is NO young, well hung, billionaire out there that would give this girl (based on her terribly unflattering description), who stupidly falls through his office door AND later in the book projectile vomits repetedly in front of him, a second look. Of course her friends, her mother, her step father, her inner goddess...the list goes on and on are aghast that this woman could get a man like Christian...Ana is laughable...someone to feel sorry for.  My friends told me this was a good \\"poolside read\\" for the summer...it has since become our poolside joke book. I mean seriously...a pale, mousey brunette insisting that this Adonis confess his love for her after three weeks?  Isn't that something that perhaps high school aged children do?  Also \\"firing up her mean machine\\"...really?  Who calls their computer a mean machine?  Who repetedly emails their supposed business tycoon boyfriend?  Alas, be it on a Blackberry or an iphone 4s...why in the hell aren't they \\"sexting\\" like the rest of the world?  I sit here biting my lower lip trying to figure this out.

I told my lady friend about this game, she played on my phone and is now hooked, we try to beat each other's high scores.  I am winning :D
B001HN6918|5.0|First off, a few character studies. The peacock villain, Lord Shen, was obsessed with power. He wanted to rule, and kung fu hindered his greed. His solution is to use a weapon of fire and metal to stop kung fu. He's an outcast son who, by trying to change his future like Oedipus of old, fulfilled it. He's full of bitterness and willing to destroy anything that gets in his way. Po, now the Dragon Warrior, faces two new challenges. One, to find \\"inner peace.\\" Two, to save kung fu from Shen's \\"cup that is never full.\\" He's haunted by visions from his past, and travels not only to save kung fu, but also to learn the secrets of his past. His connections with the furious five are growing, and they form a much stronger team. I love it when Po offers Shen the chance to be a new person, and offers forgiveness. How it ends is for you to see. These and other characters were great, and showed off some fun acting. The movie was full of chuckling humor, despite a couple cheesy lines.<br /><br />The animation was amazing, to say the least. The 3D worked really well, with all the fighting and stunts. I really liked the diverse use of animation, with the 3D, the flat cartoon-like images, and the shadow puppets. The new range of animals, including gorillas, goats, peacocks, and a croc, was very satisfying as well. As in the first film, the fight scenes were wonderfully thought up and animated. In one particular fight scene, the music was timed precisely with each of the blows and bumps, creating a really cool experience. This describes all the music composed for this film by Hans Zimmer and John Powell. I heartily enjoyed all of the music.<br /><br />Now for the movie's effectiveness as a sequel. Unlike many companies, Dreamworks wisely planned for this movie even before releasing the first, and organized the plot around it. That was a key that made it successful. Plan ahead, far ahead. I love it when a sequel works as this one does. In the plot of saving kung fu, with the subplot of finding out about his past, Po took watchers through a wonderful adventure. They even left a cliffhanger, which gives me hope that they had also planned for a third. However, along with that are a few concerns. First, I worry that they thought up this cliffhanger on the spot, and haven't planned far ahead. I want the third movie to be as much (if not more) of a success as this one was. Second, based on the cliffhanger, it may occur that the third movie takes the focus away from kung fu, and expands the \\"Po's past\\" theme to be the main show. This would be a disaster.<br /><br />Now for my final recommendation. This movie is slightly darker than the first, and is more intense. Not that it isn't for kids anymore. Kids, I believe, will still enjoy this movie, maybe even more than the first. There is no language, and no inappropriate references or behavior. All the humor is clean, and actually funny. It is rated PG by MPAA for sequences of martial arts action and mild violence.finding out about his past, Po took watchers through a wonderful adventure.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|I've just completed probably my tenth listen of Clockwork Angels (CA).<br /><br />There are fantastic songs on this album.  \\"BU2B\\", \\"The Anarchist\\", \\"The Garden\\"...all standouts.<br /><br />Or they would have been, if I was actually able to hear everything that is going on.<br /><br />In every track, there is at least one of the instrumental tracks that is drowned out by some other layer of noise...I'm not sure if it's a tremolo, a keyboard track, or what...but there are very few spots where any instrument rings clear.  In a lot of the songs, you have no hope of even guessing what Geddy is saying unless you have the liner notes in front of you.<br /><br />It's easy to make statements like this is \\"complex orchestration\\" or \\"layered\\" or \\"expansive\\", but all of those things are possible without saying \\"heck, why not just make every track sound LOUD\\".  We have volume controls on our equipment Nick, we didn't need you to do it for us.  I can feel the discomfort of the terrible mixing every time I listen, and the feeling hasn't improved with time.  The music sounds...muddy.  Loud muddy.<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Start playing this album, get into the middle of \\"The Anarchist\\" or \\"Headlong Flight\\"...then immediately switch over to listening \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" -- a song just as layered and complex as any on CA -- and you will immediately hear the difference.  All of the audio tracks on \\"Spirit\\" will sound clear to you.  Then switch back to CA and notice how Geddy's voice, Neil's drums, and Alex's guitar riffs are drowned out by...noise.<br /><br />Make no mistake -- these songs are excellent (five stars) and will be a joy to experience live.  This is some of their best and most mature songwriting.  I'm hoping there will be a live release next year so that I can fully appreciate this music.  It pains me to think that Geddy, Alex, and Neil must have listened to these tracks and said \\"yep, that's the sound we were going for\\".  I can only assume that they listened to iton some special piece of equipment that I can't afford.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|With its usual charm, Pixar delivers another fine movie, save for a letdown, which I'll explain later. Their animation captures the characters and their habits perfectly, and it couldn't be done any other way. They also continue their creativity, both in script and animation (which were yet again incredible), and had the audience laughing frequently!<br /><br />The characters were done very well. Merida, the princess, is a headstrong free spirit that wants to \\"change her fate\\" (of being betrothed against her will) at nearly any cost. Like her wild, flaming hair, she will not be held back. King Fergus is jovial and sympathetic, and yet a fiercely loyal husband. Queen Elinor is a lady proper, and wishes the same upon her daughter. The three sons, while never speaking, were portrayed fantastically. This shows the superior nature of Pixar: the ability to convey spectacularly through animated expression and posture.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT* Elinor, the prim mother, undergoes change herself. Facing the uncomfortable reality of becoming a beast, she must face her unruly side. As the credits begin to roll, one is left wondering: \\"Which character am I to look up to?\\" Merida is headstrong and sometimes disobedient. Fergus is understanding and supportive, but deaf to reason in a rage. Elinor is too strict. And what role does the witch play? Does she give Merida the spell in order to help her realize her mistake, or to cause more discord? She seemed regretful of giving the former prince the spell, in hiding her status as a witch, so it seems she has people's best interest in mind. *END SPOILER* Yet again, we find cauldrons producing what seems to result in good. Still, there is no character to completely imitate. This is one of Pixar's realistic conclusions, even if it isn't terribly original. There aren't any perfectly good people. (not even the heart-throb Young Macintosh) Everyone has a bad side to go along with their good, but each person is different. We can learn from each in a different manner.<br /><br />Once again, when the film ends, the audience is slightly confused by the \\"moral.\\" \\"You can change your fate\\" is an odd choice for Pixar, and is a bit vague. It's not so much a moral as it is a challenge. Brave doesn't rely on other Pixar films for its reasoning or popularity. It sets itself apart, even in the purpose of the film. But is that a good thing? I don't think so, in this case. \\"You can change your fate\\" seems to encompass many \\"morals,\\" including \\"do what your heart tells you,\\" and as Jeremiah 17:9 says, \\"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?\\"<br /><br />On a lighter note, this film is perfectly suitable for kids. Because of the heavy reliance on expression, they will be able to understand more than in usual animated film dialogue. *SPOILER ALERT* The only possible inappropriate scenes are when Fergus and his fellow hunters have just descended a tower using a rope made of their shed kilts. The only other one is when the three brothers change back into boys, sans clothes of course. All of this is done in good-natured Scottish humor, and isn't much to worry about. *END SPOILER*<br /><br />In conclusion, the animation was superb, and the characters were fantastic. They are the reason I would go see this movie again, rather than the vague \\"moral\\" conclusion. You can learn a lot from them, but please don't \\"follow your heart\\" as a result of this movie.<br /><br />P.S. Wait until after the credits. ;)ach in a different manner.<br /><br />Once again, when the film ends, the audience is slightly confused by the \\"moral.\\" \\"You can change your fate\\" is an odd choice for Pixar, and is a bit vague.

B00122J30S|4.0|Like most bands that have been around for decades - the Smashing Pumpkins have a full suitcase full of different sounds from different eras.  Whether or not you like this album will depend upon what you actually like about the Smashing Pumpkins.  This album isn't Mellon Collie Part 2 nor is it Adore Part 2.  This album is a hodge podge of a lot of the sounds the Pumpkins have experimented with in the past with some twists thrown into it.  Is it a Pumpkins album?  You bet.  Will this album have its fair share of critics?  Definitely.<br /><br />This album sounds like the Smashing Pumpkins.  This is important because a lot of bands (GNR?) release new albums with a new lineup to where the band doesnt even sound familiar anymore.  Corgan always was the talent behind this band so its no surprise that he can bring back the sound.<br /><br />There's plenty of rockers on this album with Doomsday Clock (this song could be on Gish or Siamese Dream), 7 Shades of Black, United States, Tarantula, Starz, and Bring the Light.  There's also some filler material as well.  Let's go, That's the way my love is, God and Country, and Neverlost are all easily forgettable.  Ive always found subpar songs on every Smashing Pumpkins album so this comes no surprise - Im sure some people enjoy them.<br /><br />So where does this album rank in SP's discography?  Well, I never cared for Adore or Machina outside a couple songs on each album.  Throughout the years, Ive found myself listening to Zeitgeist more and more and each time my appreciation for it increases.  It's kind of grown on me.  So I would say that it's better than Machina and Adore, but that's about it.  Its still a great album, but in the whole grand scheme of SP's catalog - it falls roughly somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />It's not spectacular, it's not horrible.  It has both bright points and low points.  But that has always been the case with SP and it also is part of the territory when you take risks with your music as Corganoften does.

B002ZB26AO|4.0|Barbara Demick brings to light the oft thought mundane details of daily life... Well, they would be mundane if the people experiencing them lived in most parts of the world. But, North Korea is not 'most parts of the world' and from it far too few details of ordinary life can be gleaned. Therefore, the often intimate descriptions of ordinary people's lives intermixed with factual accounts of the repressive North Korean government is extraordinarily captivating. Demick begins her compilation of stories with that of woman who recounts her innocent, yet forbidden first love. This fascinating love story is somewhat abruptly followed by another no less surreal tale. While some of the transitions between the sagas are lacking fluidity, the value of this collection of first hand accounts of life in a repressive and secretive country is priceless.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|True, this is not the best knife sharpener out there but given the S&W's size and functionality, I'd say it's first in its class.  It's very portable and has restored many of my knives to their former glory.  Also, the eyelet makes for easy attachment to other tools or knife sheaths and the fine tip of the fold-out diamond cone can sharpen even the smallest serrations.  This is a well designed product and the price gives it even greater value.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.

0143034901|5.0|I recently reread this book in anticipation of The Prisonor of Heaven, and it confirmed for me all of the reasons I love this book. I may  have actually enjoyed it the second time around more than the first time. Zafron's prose is beautiful, every word bringing you more into the story, into each character, into each place described. I wish I could read Spanish just to be able to read this in its orignal language.<br /><br />There is something for everyone in this book - mystery, intrigue, danger, history, romance. This is not a book you want to rush through, you want to be able to sit quietly and take in every word. Some of the quotes in this book are amazing - my copy has quite a few pages folded down. This is definitely a book lover's book. Although, for me, The Angel's Game didn't live up to the story of The Shadow of the Wind, I eagerly await for The Prisoner of Heaven and another trip to the Cememtary of Forgotten Books.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|Quick review.  I couldn't wait for this book to be over with.  Travis was a guy that screamed trouble, seemed like he would eventually end up in prison.  Abby?  Just a dumb college girl who played innocent all to well.  The nickname Travis gives her, \\"Pigeon\\"... made me cringe each and every time!  He even called her \\"Pidge\\".  This book was a disaster.  I'm happy I loaned it instead of actually spend a penny on it.  I have no idea what the hype is about.  It's irritating and too few women realize that the bad guy can and will eventually kill you.  Travis showed all the signs of a dysfunctional human being.  I didn't even understand Abby's backstory.  Did she have one other than her Father? I don't know.  This book made my head hurt.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|At least one cowboy and three sons agree with the good reviews! I am the wife of cowboy and mom of sons. I am passing on their opinion as I am the one that does the typing! I did not go see it yet, waiting for the dvd. It was guys' night out and we have to be a bit prejudice because one of our sons was one of the Indians in the Cavalry and Indian (maybe six seconds of) scene. :) Our son was also wrangler for the set and got to meet some super people and learned a lot from one of the older \\"Native American\\" Indians. We know which one our son is because we got to see some of the still pictures! Otherwise we might be wondering as it is such a short scene. He knows the hard work that goes into a small and momentary scene!<br />  ----We all wondered why the title name change and odd marketing procedures, but we waited to see what held in store. Our son was somewhat disappointed and muchly so when he heard critics and 'no sequel' rumors. We hope that the opinion turns around after all the good reviews from the folks that really know what they are watching.  So THANK YOU FOLKS FOR GOOD REVIEWS! (It was pretty awesome for the friends and family to see a couple of our 'local boys' from our junior rodeo be a couple of the helpers and riders :). and it is pretty neat for parents to see the names in the credits :). For the boys it was just one more day on the job!) :) They also got to see some spectacular country, some of the good ol' John Wayne area! It is all part of what goes into making a movie and we sure hope the monies are recouped (some of the workers just get enough to make wage, pay gas to get home with, and a bit more to pay taxes and get a meal!) Maybe enough GOOD SHOUTS IN THESE REVIEWS AND JUST MAYBE THERE WILL BE A SEQUEL! Somebody might get wise!

B003UESJ9M|4.0|I was surprised that I really liked this movie.  The story is a bit disjointed, and the complexity of the relationship between Paltrow's and McGraw's characters isn't clear.  There could have been more dialogue to help us understand what brought this country star to alcohol and drug abuse, which obviously predated the major emotional block in their marriage.  I also wasn't sure about the significance of the bird, but perhaps a second viewing would clear that up.  I was blown away by Paltrow's performance, which had raw emotion, nuance, and multiple emotional layers.  I thought she did a great job of playing a person successful in her career, but not living up to whom she wanted to be personally.  In the end, her career mattered more to her husband than to her, and that's what he failed to understand.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the equally strong acting and singing performances of Meester and Hedlund.  The music in this film alone makes it worth a viewing, and the film asks an important question about the price of fame and the damage it seems to do to marriages and love.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I bought this book on my E-Reader after downloading and reading an excerpt.  Unfortunately, what appealed to me in the excerpt turned out to be this book's only redeeming quality, and it took me over 2 months to wade through this snooze-fest of a book.<br /><br />The plot of the book is pretty straight-forward.  Celia and Marco were entered into a magician's competition by her father and his teacher when they were children.  The rules of the competition were never made clear.  All they know is that they are in a competition and that the competition is binding - meaning they cannot get out of it.  So they spend the first half of their lives training and preparing for the competition, and then they both end up working in a circus where they proceed to construct more and more elaborate illusions in order to prove that he or she is the better magician.  It is inevitable in a book such as this, then, that they will fall in love.  And when they try to end the competition so that they can be together, they are presented with a revelation that is both heartbreaking and cruel.<br /><br />The main quibble with this book is that it is all flash but no substance.  The author has a very distinctive voice and the evocative prose imbued the titular circus with such magical quality that the readers can't help but be drawn in.  But after a few chapters, you realize that the detailed description of everything in sight really does very little to further the plot along or to flesh out the characters, which remained two-dimensional throughout.  Celia and Marco remained cardboard cut-outs with so little personality that their romance isn't remotely compelling or believable; and the secondary characters are introduced and discarded at the drop of a hat.  Furthermore, the author chose to employ a couple of gimmicks that proved to be unnecessary, if not distracting.  For example, interspersed between every \\"real\\" chapter is a short chapter describing a particular tent in the circus from a patron's point of view.  So between each chapter you get to slog through pages and pages of descriptions using sentences such as \\"as you enter the circus\\" or \\"to you right is the illusionist's tent\\". These chapters added nothing to the plot and only served to pad a paper-thin plot.  The story also jumped around in time a lot, a device that worked wonderfully in TV shows such as \\"Lost\\" and \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" but serves no purpose here except to make things a lot more confusing.<br /><br />And a lot of the confusion came from the fact that this book is a prime example of shoddy world-building.  The book is riddled with so many plot holes and unanswered questions that left me extremely frustrated.  For example, we knew from the first pages of the book that Celia is a real magician - someone born with supernatural abilities so that the illusions she performs are not illusions but real.  But what about Marco?  We know that he's a \\"trained\\" magician plucked out of an orphanage by his teacher.  But how was he trained, and how does his brand of magic work?  How did he learn and how is it that he can perform illusions as compelling as those of Celia's without having been born into the ability?  If the whole point of the competition is to prove that \\"real\\" magicians are superior to \\"trained\\" magicians, then the whole foundation upon which the story is built has been undermined by the author's inability to answer these questions.  The rules of the competition was also never explained, so the author can have free rein to make up things as she goes along.  And the reveurs whose only purpose in life is to follow the circus from town to town?  How is that remotely believable?  I know that reading fantasy works such as these requires a certain willingness to suspend disbelief.  But that doesn't mean I have to check logic at the door and that the characters should not act is a logical manner.<br /><br />All in all, this book was a huge disappointment given the hype and I will never understand what the hype was all about.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I at first thought it was going to be a 3D game ith great graghics because of the good reviews. When I first started it, I was surprised at the 2D format and thought it looked rather primitive, but when I started to play it, I quickly got addicted to it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Lots of bad reviews but works perfect for me on HTC evo lte some nice effects like tilt shifting and more
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is really neat. I am excited to see what else I can do with it! woo hoo hoo
B007D2XSW0|4.0|It looks like whatever issues people had with this app on the Kindle have been fixed with the app's 2.0 update. You can easily upload from your gallery and save back to it as well as the social site functions. I was skeptical of this FAOTD because of all the recent horrible reviews, but the app functions well as a nice photo editor on the Kindle Fire. It would seem that the creators of it fixed the bugs. Just thought you should know. :)
B004J4WN0I|4.0|i really enjoyed it<br />it was impossible for me to stop reading it<br />i will give 4 star because there are fantasy writer that are better but the story is wonderful and for sure i will buy the second book
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I am running the 2011 Macbook Air which has a Thunderbolt port. It's running OS X v10.7.4 which is the latest and required. I also did a software update check and it found the update required for the Thunderbolt adapter to work. Pretty easy setup.<br /><br />But who bought this to use on the Mac side anyways!<br /><br />Here's how it went down on Windows 8 32bit Consumer preview. The same will apply to Windows 7 32bit users also. In order for the device to be found, you must have it plugged into the Thunderbolt port, then turn on your computer. I found no matter what I did, unless it booted with it plugged in, it would not work. The drivers will not auto install nor are they available from Windows Update. You must download them from Broadcom. Google \\"broadcom driver windows netxtreme desktop\\" and it is the first link since it cannot be posted here.<br /><br />I used the Windows 7 drivers and they worked for Windows 8. Just go into device manager and update the driver that way, selecting the file you just downloaded.<br /><br />Very simple process. Remember to have it plugged in before you boot into Windows. Also an FYI, the adapter gets surprisingly very warm to the touch.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Many negative reviews but since it was the free app of the day I downloaded it. Three reviews said it would not work on Droid Incredible. I'm sure it was a problem for them but it works just fine on mine. Many complaints that you cannot save the photos to the gallery. Yes you can. There are three save options. Twitter icon, Facebook icon, and the word \\"Save\\". Just click \\"Save\\" and the photo is saved to the gallery. All in all, a nice addition to my phone.

The space bar is finally large enough that I dont accidentally hit the period and the punctuation being able to slide is a great idea imho. Great keyboard before and even better after the update.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun you get so much money for the easiest things I suggest this game to everybody!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good stuff hopefully I get free points :) I cant wait till I get to the next level.  is that enough?
B0086700CM|5.0|Great graphics! This game is very fun.<br />It runs well on my Kindle Fire<br />with no problems. Fun game that is free!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This editor works great on the ASUS Transformer Prime and Samsung Transform Ultra. The editor works great and well worth the cost. Other poor reviewers that are experiencing problems need to report them to the developers or request a refund. Developers cannot fix a problem without crash reports and other information. Whining because the app doesn't work and panning the app in the review does nothing but make life worse for everyone. Just a note, a lot of the people who are whining about the app not working and giving one star just shows how petty, silly and selfish because they got the app for free!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An unexpected page turner. Friends warning me that this was mommy-porn could not prepare me for the true love story that was revealed in this trilogy. Not to spoil Darker or Freed, I was really taken with both Christian and Ana, character flaws and all. I thought EL James didn't disappoint in terms of describing the carnal desires (and kinky preferences), youth and immaturity of the two and communication gaffes created by misunderstanding. I will likely read all three again just to get swept away in the romance. I learned some new terms but wasn't overly bothered by the physical intimacies given my initial hesitation to pick up the series. I was very disappointed in the ending...made me so angry that I downloaded Darker the minute I finished to keep reading!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|One of the most poorly written books I have ever read. I read it because I heard about how great it was and was very disappointed. I don't recommend it at all.
1594630844|5.0|What a brilliant concept, a crowd sourced manual for how to live life with input from the wisest people alive.  I sincerely believe in the merit behind all 30 of these lessons, they are the recipe to the secret sauce of life.  I am going to anonymously send this book to people I know who could use it the most.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|The only song on this album that I don't like is Wildflower.  I love Panopticon and hope it is the first \\"single\\" from the album that receives airplay.  I also love The Celestials, Oceania, Inkless, Pinwheels and Glissandra.  I feel that Violet Rays, Pale Horse, My Love Is Winter, and The Chimera are very strong songs as well.  One Diamond, One Heart and Quasar are decent songs with Quasar having an awesome riff, but weak lyrics.<br /><br />I'm glad the Pumpkins decided to do an album again.
0307472841|3.0|This is quite an unusual type of thriller. One expects another book by a Swedish author to be in the style of many television programmes from Sweden and Denmark. This book started off like one of those programmes, with an account of a horrendous crime in a small village, and it finished with the reader knowing by whom  and why that crime had been committed.<br /><br />However, in between there are accounts of what happened to someone who went from China and returned why America quite a few decades ago. The central character in the story becomes a female judge from Sweden.  There is quite a lot of detail about the treatment of people who were working on building the railway in America, and about Chinese politics, especially internal conflicts.<br />As you read the book you start wondering where all this is going. If you persevere than the events leading up to the horrendous crimes become clear. Not being sure about the nature of the content of the book, I looked up Mankell  and it then became clear that he did have some political objectives in writing the book in this particular fashion. His passionate concern about equality, his personal political ideology and his interest in Africa account for this unusual type of thriller.<br /><br />In many ways it was interesting to learn a lot about Chinese politics and how that is impacting on the world today. In the same way conflicts and tensions in some parts of Africa were also informative.<br /><br />However, you wondered as to whether all the events took place were not far too contrived to fulfil the author's political aims. For example, it was very convenient that the female judge had a friend who was going to China and she needed a break and so went to China. Another example is that odf the incident when someone broke into her house, but did not harm her. And it was clear later on in the story that the burglar's aim was to kill the judge. So why not kill her when she was completely alone in the house?<br /><br />Thereare many other questions one would ask. I would like to read other books by Mankell not because I am expecting them to be excellent thrillers but because his political insight, although biased, is interesting.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|this app sucks. it is telling me that &quot;there is a problem with the kindle fire&quot;, but I am using my phone to open pic from my album.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Listened to the clips on Amazon and like their music. Ended up ordering this CD and also Genuine Negro Jig. Both are excellent and fun CD's. Highly recommended.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Absolute best photo editor I've ever had! it freezes up occasionally but other than that, everything is great! they have a variety of filters and its nice to pick from them.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|I'm more of a casual fan of Norah's than a hard core one, but I was definitely pleased with most of this album. It has a bit of a different sound for her, and that was a good thing. Typically she has a lot of moody, slow songs which I tend to find basically boring. She obviously has some gems in every record, but I feel this one may have had the most consistently high quality tracks. If you are even mildly interested in Norah Jones, I think you would enjoy at least half of this album. The first track does start slow, but it is kinda cool. It gets a lot more upbeat with track 2, Say Goodbye. The title track is also slower, but quality. There are definitely a few that I don't care for, but there are also quite a few that are unique and fun. Highlights are Say Goodbye and All A Dream.
0307277887|3.0|\\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" is not a bad read.  After all, it spawned the character of Dexter Morgan that Showtime metamorphosed into an anti-hero the likes of such only Walter White of AMC's \\"Breaking Bad\\" and perhaps Don Draper of that same network's \\"Mad Men\\" could possibly rival.  If there is a problem with \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter, it lies in the expectation that author Jeff Lindsay could possibly power-up his brain to compete and/or compliment those of the group of most likely highly paid writers employed by the television series \\"Dexter\\" with the incentive to continually shock and titillate its audience.  Sadly, no matter what Lindsay does, legally or literally, the character Dexter no longer is his sole proprietorship--Dexter is like HAL in \\"2001\\"or Dr. Frankenstein's monster; he has taken on an identity and personality of his own and this is the persona to which the audience relates and responds.  Showtime's Dexter IS Dexter.<br /><br />In \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter,\\" we glimpse Eliza Doolittle before she blossoms into \\"My Fair Lady,\\"  We hear his voice and we recognize Dexter and the presence of his \\"dark passenger.\\"  We understand his abnormality--his need to playact emotions that he doesn't feel because we are already conditioned to like the Dexter of the show.  We enjoy his sardonic wit and understand when he is preparing a vigilante kill according to the \\"Code of Harry.\\"  What fails to entertain us in the pre-series world of Dexter's introduction as a recurring main character in a series of novels is the divergence of the book from the plot meticulously outlined in the first series of the show.  Reading Lindsay after seeing the first series was like sawing off a foot for Dexter instead of a whole leg.<br /><br />Key characters that the show develops don't even make it out of the pages of \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter.\\"  Most of the premise is there--the Icebox Killer and the link to Dexter's childhood, but because I was waiting for what I knew happened in the series, I was seriously disappointed when it not only didn't occur, the book fizzled to a too quick and  different ending that killed off characters that enrich the series' following seasons immensely.<br /><br />Dexter Morgan is still there; he's just a single guitar playing without the technology of his band or maybe he's a blunt knife and not a chainsaw.<br /><br />Bottom line?  If you, like me, got hooked on Showtime's Dexter, you most likely will be disappointed by \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter,\\" the first novel by Jeff Lindsay that features serial killer vigilante Dexter Morgan.  Lindsay's Dexter is most assuredly recognizable.  However, the situations and premise of the novel's plot are better realized by the writers of the series. Unfortunately, for the book, the first series of the television show added more nuance and kept interesting characters in the mix that add a comfortable comradery to the cast as a whole.  Their vision of Dexter and his makeshift family make you want to watch.  Recommended just for Dexter die-hards.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"s, I was seriously disappointed when it not only didn't occur, the book fizzled to a too quick and  different ending that killed off characters that enrich the series' following seasons immensely.<br /><br />Dexter Morgan is still there; he's just a single guitar playing without the technology of his band or maybe he's a blunt knife and not a chainsaw.<br /><br />Bottom line?

B007P6VLRS|5.0|Sometime since 2007's hopeful, yet underwhelming last full length \\"Zeitgeist\\" sole surviving Pumpkin Billy Corgan had some kind of emotional quake to invoke this much yin & yang of beauty and fury, which has always been the key combination to the most dearly loved of Smashing Pumpkins anthems. Yes... this is the album Pumpkins fans have been waiting for.  Fans of \\"Gish\\" & \\"Siamese Dream\\" take notice.  Guitars wail in distortion amid tribal beats (\\"Quasar\\", \\"Panopticon\\", \\"The Chimera\\", \\"Inkless\\").  Heart strings are yanked at and torn off by the teeth (\\"The Celestials\\", \\"One Diamond, One Heart\\", and the phenomenal \\"Violet Rays\\"). Progressive electronic elements explored on previous albums like \\"Adore\\" are borrowed from, but never overwhelm, adding to the beautiful sonic atmosphere (\\"Pinwheels\\"and the amazing closer \\"Wildflower\\").  The entire album flows easily cohesive and satisfying.  A concept album of the heart.  A simple, age old concept which seems to get more and more lost within this digital age.  It's ironic how just a few years ago Corgan was so vocal about releasing only downloadable singles, shying away from the full album mentality,  to produce something that makes you remember why the album as a whole is so vital in the first place.  One of the best of 2012.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Once I figured out the correct play style the game became super easy for a while. Now they're a bit tougher. I'm on 2-3. 3rd time around should be pretty brutal.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|Bared to You was a great read.  If you liked 50 Shades of Grey then you will like this book.  A lot of similarities. A true love story just with hot sex.  People with problems being accepted and loved. These characters are loveable and straightforward.  Loved it and will buy her sequel.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book incredibly lame. The main characters are flat, irritating and quite frankly annoying. The writing is atrocious! The author chose to repeat several themes throughout the book and it gets very redundant. She put the rot in Erotica.
B005WFUZTE|5.0|This cd blew my mind.  I hadn't listened to Megadeth in ages because I thought they went too soft and left their thrash roots.  This cd changed that perception, the growling vocals and ripping guitar rifts took me back to my younger days and my joy for speed metal.  I've since walked my way backwards and started picking up other Deth cds like Endgame and United Abominations (which is my fave so far).  The System is Broken is on its way..
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album sounded good the first time I listened to it, and it get better each and every time, thereafter.  This is a concept album, which I love, but a lot of other people don't like.<br />The theme of the album is this:  You're going to get screwed over and crapped on by other (evil and hateful) people, but you need to let all the hate angst and hatred go, that is in your heart, and just pursue your own happiness and wish them well.  I wish I was mature enough to follow the advice, but my hate and angst still drive me.  Remember Neil Peart(the drummer and lyricist) lost his wife and daughter within 6 months of each other, so he's been to hell and back.<br />I love the lyrics, liner notes, the sound, the singing, everything.  I think it is one of their best efforts, if not the best EVER.<br />I don't care what the other Rush fans say, and I can't wait to see them live, in Atlanta, on November 1, 2012.
B002OSXDAU|2.0|Often, when an author has a thinly veiled political agenda--no matter what it is--the story suffers for it. While this book isn't as cringe-worthy as Atlas Shrugged, still, there were many parts of it that were downright strange, you could even say lurid. First of all, the author's contempt for the human race practically sizzles off each page. Secondly, Howard Roark is nothing less than a sociopath. Thirdly, that whole rape scene and its meaning was just nasty on many levels. There are elegant moments in this book, certainly, but for the most part it's just a creepy product of a rather disturbed mind.

B000UR366S|5.0|I was surprised with this CD, which I liked since my first listening. It is good to know that after almost six years from her last work 'Travelogue', she is still in tune and productive.    The opening song which is instrumental is great. I think she should start exploring more instrumental music. Maybe a real ballet oriented work as A. Coopland did in the past. All remaining songs show a coherent production of her trademark style, which means she will enjoy the listener. Her voice which was affected by an illness some time ago and now it is better than her last work. She is singing better in lower keys to compensate the change of her voice timbre and roughness.    The artwork of this CD shows the Joni Mitchell's The Fiddle and the Drum ballet which DVD is available at Amazon in this link:    [...]  which uses a collection of songs from Joni's portfolio. The theme name is a song from her second album 'Clouds'.    I think there is not any living artist developing songs and artwork as she does today. You can find Joni's like singers today, but not as complete artist as she is.    Shine Joni, shine!
0345803485|2.0|I. Cannot.  Believe. This. Book. Is. On. The. New. York. Times. Best. Seller. List.  Oh my, what can I say?  No character building, no plot, and erotica that quickly goes stale.  Someone mentioned this book (called it porn) and said it was a fun read.  Since I was out of the country and bored, I downloaded it onto my Kindle.  My very first impression was how simplistic and immature the writing was.  Instead of character and plot building, superficial details were given; what a character was wearing, color of hair,...And it never got better.  I never did find out why Christian found Ana so beautiful.  For all I know she was a mousy stick.  Was she smart? Independent? Brave?  Anything would have helped.  But the author did not give any clues as to Ana's character.  Ditto for all the characters.  I am embarassed I finished this book....and I am appalled that this book is on the NY Times Best Seller List.  I had no idea it was popular.  Makes me sad.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I have it on my kindle and it works great on it. very well put together. bravo :D
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting. What a wonderful person Richard was. Besides from being super smart (obviously), he liked to enjoy every bit of life. That includes things you wouldn't necessarily expect from a physicist (drinking, chasing girls, etc.). The thing that stuck with me the most was his sense of curiosity. Everyone should be more like Richard Feynman.

1936608898|5.0|Land Ahoy! Dallas and Melissa Hartwig have sent you a lifeboat!  They call it, 'It Starts With Food'.  Just the title gives you an idea of the simplicity that lies within. If understanding something well enough to make it simple, means you really get it, then they must have very large brains. There is a reason ISWF is in the number slot in nutrition books on Amazon.  They have made simple look easy.<br /><br />It Starts With Food is not only easy to read, it is entertaining! To be honest, I almost didn't read it.  I thought it was going to be another diet book just regurgitating the same ole same ole.  I mean, how many ways can you reinvent the wheel? I am so glad I listened to all the tweets that were chirping loudly about this fun read. It takes some pretty dry and complicated nutrition information, throws in a dash of metaphors, a dollop of animated charts, a pinch of  humorous headings, some fine sifting with their 'science-y' stuff, and spices it up with some tough love.  Dallas and Melissa have mixed it all together to create a recipe for a hot and delicious book.  They even make the cooking and recipes look simple. All of this without dumbing it down.  It is so simple even Einstein would approve.
0765316994|1.0|After having read and thoroughly enjoyed \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" by John Scalzi I looked forward with anticipation to the release of his latest novel \\"Redshirts.\\"  Many writers improve their skills with writing and plot over the years as each new novel they produce reveals their creative imagination and Scalzi has shown himself to be such a writer.<br /><br />However, Scalzi seems to have hit a speed bump with this one after he has showed us what he is capable of with his previous novels.  I for one was sorely disappointed with \\"Redshirts.\\"<br /><br />After 40 pages into \\"Redshirts\\" I kept thinking this will improve Scalzi has not hit his stride for this one yet.  After another 20 pages I could not wait to finish the book so I could pick up something of a better caliber.  Many will see the spoof on the \\"Redshirts\\" from Star Trek episodes, their seemingly unimportant lives, which furnished the humor for the story.  Other reviewers go into more depth on the story so I will not take up space rehashing what I consider a minor novel that would have worked better as a short story.<br /><br />The characters and dialogue were immature, the plot uninteresting, the attempt at humor passable.<br /><br />If you are a Scalzi fan like I am, skip this one and wait for something better in the future.  If you feel a need to find out for yourself, get a copy from the library and save the money.  I rate \\"Redshirts\\" 1 star.  I enjoyed John Scalzi's past works and hope he tries harder next time.
0061692042|5.0|For years I had appreciated Richard Ford's intelligence and elegance of style but had never been able to finish a single one of his books. This is certainly not the case with 'Canada', which is not only the story of one uprooted family but works at the level of a metaphor of all uprooted American lives. There is a fine tension between the voice of the narrator as an adult and of his feelings as a child watching his family fall to pieces in the wake of his parents' hair-brained scheme to rob a bank. At no point does Ford ever lose his compassion, which is what makes this novel not just good but great.
B008CP93S0|1.0|[[ASIN:B005S28ZES Amazon.com Gift Cards - In a Gift Box - Free One-Day Shipping]]Not very original about hippies in a commune without the sixty's music. My Grandpa might like it. How about something more up to date?
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|This book is for teenagers. And if you are a teenager, you may enjoy it.  But if you are an adult, then you'll likely be disappointed by the low reading level, the \\"just accept it as given\\" take on the unlikely technology and social history, and the derivative plot. At best I would say this is a diverting and reasonably competent movie novelization (pick any syfy channel movie that includes virtual reality).<br />But I was greatly disappointed, as I was lead to believe this was an adult level novel and so expected a believable extrapolation of the near future and realistic plot developments. Physical access to the internet is mostly owned by an evil corporation, yet they can't isolate where people are logging in from?  The hero, who is not a pro hacker, is able to completely rewrite his government ID files, but the corporation is not able to match his login to his real identity? In a world of no energy and a permanent depression, the AFFORDABLE housing solution is to build metal frame towers 20+ stories tall for stacking mobile homes?  And so on.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I am almost all of the way through the 5th book at the moment, and I must say: This is the most depressing series I have ever read!!!  There are no moments of levity in this series.  The book is nothing but a all of the characters getting kicked in the face at every turn.  Almost every time there is a good or interesting character, he or she is killed.  And if they are not killed, they are beaten down over and over again so you wish they could die just to be put out of their misery!!!  I have taken a long time to get through this series, because it is so damned depressing that I have repeatedly had too stop for a few weeks and read something more upbeat.  Martin stated that he does not plan this series to have everyone live happily ever after, well I could have told you that!!!  If he keeps this up everybody will die in the winter.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I must admit that even as a life-long Beach Boys fan (minus the Love/Johnston era nonsense!) I groaned a little inside when I heard that they were contemplating a 50th Anniversary get together.  My hopes weren't very high, quite frankly.  Boy do I love to be proven wrong!<br /><br />When I heard those opening harmonies, within seconds I was reconsidering my hasty opinion.  This album is one of the happiest surprises of my Beach-Boys-sated life and I couldn't possibly be more thankful that they mustered the energy and courage to go through with the idea.  It is a real gem.<br /><br />It took me a minute to warm up to a couple of the songs, but I can honestly say that I love this album in its entirety, from start to finish, and boy, what a start and finish it is!  As a prime example of one song I balked at initially, The Private Life of Bill and Sue struck me as an oddity to pass over, but once I got the gist of the lyric, coupled with some of the happiest music ever sung on the chorus, I knew I'd been wrong again.  But my favorite example of ultra low expectations being dispelled is the only Mike Love contribution on the album, Daybreak Over the Ocean, which grew on me fairly rapidly despite internal resistance (bias).  I love to be proven wrong!<br /><br />I'm totally had.  Brian Wilson has struck pay dirt again.  And no, I'm not really surprised.  That's why God made Brian Wilson!

B007MDB71O|4.0|John Carter (originally titled John Carter of Mars) is based on the 1917 novel A Princess of Mars by Tarzan-scribe Edgar Rice Burroughs. An adaptation has been trying to get off the ground since 1931. When the film was finally released to theaters in March, financial prospects were already hopeless. John Carter is now infamous for what a huge flop it was for Disney. On a budget of $250 million (not counting marketing), it only grossed only $72 million in America. Despite what a gargantuan flop it was, it still managed to gross $280 million worldwide, while setting box office records in Russia. The novel it's based on was the first in a series of 11 novels, but this is hardly an established property. I think few would argue that the failure of John Carter was a failure of marketing. The \\"of Mars\\" was dropped from the title. A rumored reason being that Disney didn't want people to draw a correlation between this film and their recent Mars Needs Moms film, which was also a colossal flop. The trailers were too vague, giving no real indication of what the film was about. When will Disney (and other film studios) realize that it's not an established property or trying to get people to disassociate a film from an unrelated film that brings in box office? It's an intriguing trailer and word-of-mouth that will bring financial rewards. John Carter of Mars would not have reminded people of Mars Needs Moms, but the trailer did remind people of Prince of Persia.<br /><br />The financial hit that Disney took for this film has been widely reported, so much that it's overshadowed the film itself. So how is John Carter? Not bad. What immediately separates John Carter from most films like it is that it isn't a sci-fi, action blockbuster. It's an adventure movie a la Indiana Jones...And you don't see too many films like that anymore. It's a much better film than its reputation would lead you to believe.<br /><br />The film opens on Barsoom (the official name of Mars) and gives a bit of back-story, as well as making it clear that the film will be a visual treat. It then jumps back to New York City, 1881 where John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), a former American Civil War Confederate Army captain, dies suddenly. His nephew Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) inherits his estate and his private journal. As he begins reading, the film once again jumps back to 1868. Here, John Carter escapes the grasp of a Union Colonel (Bryan Cranston) and ends up in a cave where a mysterious medallion transports him to Mars. Because of the physical characteristics of Mars and Carter's bone density, he is able to jump to great heights and utilize great strength. He is captured by some Martians called Tharks and soon finds himself caught in the middle of a war between two cities of Barsoom, with a Princess named Dejah (Lynn Collins) caught in the middle.<br /><br />Action, romance, aliens, war, a lot of eye-popping visual effects, and a charismatic lead actor; John Carter has every essential element necessary to appeal to the broadest audience possible. It's clear throughout the film where the $250 million budget went and the film benefits from this price tag in a way investors did not. The sets are grand and, like most of the film, terrific to look at.<br /><br />John Carter has about as much depth as the average film of this sort, but it's a largely superficial film. It doesn't purely rely on special effects and CGI to tell the story, but the story isn't particularly exciting or fresh. Granted, it's based on a story that was written almost 100 years ago but we've seen this template thousands of times in movies. Still, there is a certain amount of originality due to director Andrew Stanton's visual prowess. Stanton previously directed the Pixar films Finding Nemo and Wall*E, so he has an eye for telling a story visually. Even with his ability to stage a visual extravaganza, his visual sense recalls other films...I could never escape the idea that I was watching Indiana Jones thrown into Star Wars on the set of Lawrence of Arabia. Furthermore, despite a script by 3 different people; much of what's good relies on aspects that weren't on paper. The dialogue is heavy-handed and plodding, but it offers no surprises nor is it particularly important.<br /><br />Even with familiar themes, John Carter is entertaining and it's chock-full of fine actors (including Mark Strong, Ciaran Hinds, Willem Dafoe, and Thomas Haden Church to name a few) and the visual effects are particularly impressive. A familiar template for a story, with fine actors and astounding visual effects? That sounds like Avatar. Yeah...And John Carter, while far from perfect, still does nearly everything better than Avatar. The CGI-heavy action sequences are thrilling and consistently appealing on a visual level. A lot of effort was put into these visual effects and they're quite convincing. One battle sequence is intercut with a traumatic event in Carter's past and is both unexpected and effectively executed.<br /><br />Had this been a hit, it would've done been a major success for the charismatic Kitsch. He brings more depth to his performance as Carter than the film requires. He's got a great, commanding speaking voice and is a very talented physical performer as well. His performance, like the film, is pretty serious-minded. That's where comparisons to Indiana Jones end. There's a minimal amount of humor in John Carter, which is particularly surprising when most films of this sort rely on some type of comic relief.<br /><br />CGI aside, this film would feel right at home as a 70s movie. You don't see blockbuster fare like this too often anymore. I didn't love John Carter, but here's a rare example where a sequel may actually be warranted...And could no doubt be better than this first installment. There's a terrific and simple twist ending that actually concludes the film on a nice note and made me a bit disheartened that there would be no sequel. It's a crowd-pleasing film that will likely find an audience on home video. It falls short of being marvelous, but it certainly entertains and that's really all it needs to do.

B002OSY2T6|4.0|My barely 4 mos old daughter has just become very interested in toys. We got this hoping to increase the duration of tummy time. Success! She loves it. She is constantly grabbing and swatting at it. One of her favorite things to do is knock it over and spin the wheels. The bright red lady bug is a huge hit, with her constantly staring at it or reaching for it. She also likes to grab the antennae. I do worry a bit about the antennae as they are hard plastic and she is clumsy, as all babies are at this age (ok well babies in general), but so far there have been no issues. The locking feature is nice but I haven't found much use for it yet. I agree with other reviewers that the motion sensor is too sensitive. Walking past it can set it off. All in all I would highly recommend this.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|great story, can't put it down. kindle is the only way to read!<br />kindle is light & easy to travel with, thin & takes up no room when packed.<br />no bent pages, quick back peddling for reread.<br />The book great with details for people who are following the hbo show.
B00845PV16|2.0|I won't say much other than do not waste your time or money on this movie. It is horrible, I loved the first ghost rider but this was not even close to watchable.

0142420891|5.0|Where She Went is a stunning follow-up to If I Stay, where we first met Mia Hall in an out-of-body experience, following a horrific car accident that left her parents and little brother dead, and Mia in a coma. If you're reading this review, you've likely read If I Stay, and if you haven't, you may want to wait to continue reading until you do.<br /><br />In Where She Went, the story is narrated by Adam: hot lyricist and guitarist of nationally-acclaimed Shooting Star, and jilted, heart-broken ex-boyfriend of renowned cellist, Mia Hall. From Adam, we learn what happened in the weeks, months, and yes, even years, after the accident. No one was left unscathed, least of all Adam.<br /><br />I was completely floored by Adam's voice - and by voice, I mean how Gayle Forman allowed him to speak through her writing. It spoke to me. He recounts, via past- and present-tense narration, the emotional and psychological fallout of his relationship with Mia, with his band, and most of all, with himself. I could feel his fury, his pain, his confusion. He really struggles internally with himself and with his feelings toward Mia. I wished I could wrap him in a big hug and tell him that it will all be okay.<br /><br />** For three months, I lay in my childhood bed, wishing myself as comatose as Mia had been. That had to be easier than this. My sense of shame finally roused me. I was nineteen years old, a college dropout, a layabout, a cliche. My parents had been cool about the whole thing, but the reek of my pathetic was starting to make me sick. **<br /><br />When Adam finally -accidentally- meets up with Mia in Manhatan, there is so much tension! I held my breath through a lot of it, waiting either for Adam to explode, or for Mia to freak out and bail. I had so many questions for Mia, but poor Adam had even more. The question we both shared, though, was simply: Why? The answer was and is not simple. As Mia and Adam traipse across Manhattan, ducking into secret gardens, obscure bowling alleys, greasy diners, and the quiet deck of the Staten Island Ferry, we learn more about what Adam and Mia have been through since they parted ways. This meandering adventure may have been my favorite part. There is a lot to be said for showing, not telling, in a story.<br /><br />It was so fascinating, witnessing Adam evolve throughout his journey. He certainly went through the \\"Seven Stages of Grief\\" and while it was heart-breaking initially, it was also inspiring. I learned so much about healing and acceptance through Adam's lyrical prose.<br /><br />** But I'd do it again. I know that now. I'd make that promise a thousand times over to have heard her play last night or to see her in the morning sunlight. Or even without that. Just to know that she's somewhere out there. Alive. **<br /><br />Maybe it's because I'm a bit musically-obsessed myself, but I feel like reading Where She Went was a bit like listening to a symphony. The dirge-like lows, the tentative middles, the soaring highs. Oh, and that ending... The ending was a sweet, sweet cresendo, as the harmony and melody converged, and finally, the last note faded away, leaving behind a sense of jubilation and peace.<br /><br />** \\"You?\\" is all I can manage to choke out.<br />\\"Always me,\\" she replies softly, bashfully. \\"Who else?\\" **<br /><br />Needless to say Where She Went left me satisfied, awe-struck, and even a little sad - but in a good way. I think Adam \\"Wilde Man\\" Wilde said it best, and I'll leave it at this:<br /><br />** It's no big dramatic before-after. It's more like that melancholy feeling you get at the end of a really good vacation. Something special is ending, and you're sad, but you can be that sad because, hey, it was good while it lasted, and there'll be other vacations, other good times... **ng alleys, greasy diners, and the quiet deck of the Staten Island Ferry, we learn more about what Adam and Mia have been through since they parted ways.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I grew up reading Stephen King books, and haven't read one in several years. 11/22/63 was on my book club list, and I read the entire book in less than a week. I couldn't put it down! It had the typical Stephen King feel, but more real life than I remembered. Everyone in my book club loved it, even people who normally don't read Stephen King. I will definitely be reading more Stephen King books this summer!

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|The crew of Prometheus travels to a distant planet in search of the Engineers, whom they believe are responsible for the creation of the human race.<br /><br />This is a tough film to award stars for.  I really wanted to like it and it delivers masterfully on a visual level.  There are also some very good individual scenes.  Unfortunately, the screenplay is pretty much a mess.  It's hard to imagine that such an unprofessional, irrational group of characters would be selected for such an important mission.  Exhibit A: the team members who decide to bail in the middle of a trip to an alien relic because they decide it's too scary but also think it's a good idea to try to pet a weird-looking alien.  The film also raises a lot of unanswered questions about the Engineers and their motivations.  I enjoy it when a well-written film declines to answer all the questions it raises, but this script has so many inconsistencies that any planned ambiguities get lost in the general sloppiness.<br /><br />Nevertheless, since I can't award half-stars, I'm going with four instead of three.  I was consistently entertained by the effects and performances, there are some great set pieces (such as a brutal dust storm), and I can't deny a certain thrill at the iconic sight of (SPOILER AHEAD!) an Engineer transforming into the Space Jockey from \\"Alien\\" as he seats himself at the controls of his ship.  I will be there for the sequel.  I want to see what becomes of Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and David (Michael Fassbender).  I will be really wanting to like it and really hoping not to be disappointed again.

0345803507|4.0|I wasn't that keen to read Fifty Shades but my friends kept going on about so I gave it a go.  I am so glad I did, I laughed, cried and OMG'd all thru the 3 books!!!!  Its no work of Shakespeare but its a good read, it gets a bit repetitive with the head tilting, constant declarations of love, etc. but the story ticks along nicely and the sex titillating. All in all a good weeks reading.<br /><br />As for those readers complaining about the price....that should be taken up with Amazon and not published as legitimate reviews of the book.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|These books were poorly written for starters !  It is pretty much an adult version of twilight ! They seem to be havin sex every six pages . The first book was the best . It doesnt  follow the bd/sm relationship it claims to !! After a while they just make you laugh .. If wouldn't buy the books, if you want to read them borrow them form a friend ! But please don't waste you'r money !!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This 3rd novel by Gillian Flynn has the least likeable characters that I have ever met. Even though the characters were deplorable, I loved the plot. I couldn't stop turning the pages. This is the first book in a long time that I would even read while I was walking in the hallways at work. Any time I had a couple of minutes, I would sneak time to read just a bit more. Wow. The plot twists are shocking right up until the last bit of the book. Just. Shocking. Anyone who loves surprises and suspense should read this book.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|love it so will u. and can use facebook and twitter omg idk what else too say soooooooooo bye bye
B004J4WKTW|1.0|I always finish books once I start.  99.9% of the time.  This is one book I started reading that did not finish.  I honestly had no idea what was going on or who these characters were.  There was no reason for me to keep reading.  I did not follow the story nor did I care for the characters.  I had read good reviews but could not get into it.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I cannot explain to someone who has not watched this series how excellent it is. I have watched each season over and over, and I never get sick of it.

B007D2XSW0|3.0|I liked the app and everything works fine till you decide to share with Facebook or twitter ( only two options) and then is a pain you know where, the integration with any social media service should be easy and painless. But with this app is frustrating and that is sad because like I said before is not bad at all with a decent amount of filters, effects, and edit options. So I will keep it and will give 5 stars when developer fix the sharing interface. Motorola Photon

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The trilogy of Fifty Shades of Grey was exhilirating, sexually stimulating, provocative, insightful, a kept-you-interested page-by-page could not put in down type of book. I am still not over it and imagine that somewhere out there is a real life \\"Fifty\\", wow!!<br /><br />I recommend this trilogy set for all women who want to reignite their sexual goddess and their relationship with their \\"significant other\\".<br /><br />Truly, I may read it again from start to finish!<br /><br />Loved it!!
B004LWZW88|5.0|This was a great movie.  I found this as a great buy for around $11 on Amazon and purchased it not realizing that I had already bought a copy a while back.  Not really worth returning it so I'll keep it as a gift for a friend or relative.

They lasted for about a year the the left ear cup broke off the part that goes over your head.  I never really abused the headset in any way so I don't know really how it happened, but it did.  Maybe mine just wasn't perfect.  The sound quality is very high def, and they are very comfortable usually.  8/10 (would be 9/10 if they didn't break).

Matt Scannell was the amazing guitarists and singer as always and Hugh Jackman really proved to be an outstanding entertainer outside the big screen!  I expected to pay so much more for this collection, it's a real steal!  Buy it today, you will be glad you did!

B0056BMK6K|5.0|John,<br /><br />Simply put, your book, with a little decoding, makes total sense. You were write in say that if one has an understanding of internet marketing, the rest just made perfect sense.<br /><br />In any case, I understand that not everyone may have had enough information to get exactly what you did to make it work for you. I understand that there are some fundamental things that must be done. Although I don't think I'd ever use Twitter or a blog, I most definitely will try and get folks to sign up on a landing page for the next release/update.<br /><br />Thanks for the valuable information John. For those of you who aren't internet marketers, take the system outline and wrap it around what you are doing. Not everything will be as perfect but having everything in place will help in the long run, especially if you've got a series of books like John.<br /><br />Thanks again!

B0061JPYX2|5.0|This is one of the best cds in my music library; even though it was put together rather quickly in the wake of Amy's untimely death, its so masterfully done! I love the alternate versions of her already classic songs. My favorite is her rendition of \\"A Song for You\\" by Donny Hathaway, its gut-wrenchingly beautiful, you can feel the heartache, pain and regret in her soulful voice. Amy was a rare, raw talent that had a unique old soul. Her song lyrics and talent belied her mere 27 chronological years. Amy is one of my absolute favorite singers! I fell in love with her music when I first heard \\"Back to Black\\" in early 2007. Upon hearing B2B I quickly found her previous cd, \\"Frank\\". Its a tragedy that she only made 2 cds; so I was quick to buy \\"Lioness: Hidden Treasures\\" as soon as it was released. Lioness is a true gem! Amy was a treasure and she is truly missed!
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great movies at a great price.  This value was one not to miss!  The entire series like this can make you a \\"couch potato\\" for a day!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|People who have not read the book should,because it's not what you think. It is a very good trilogy on book 3!!!!!!!!!!!
0345803485|2.0|Don't like 'em. Flat characters whom I suppose would be archetypes if they actually had any complexity. Rich, Troubled, Broodingly Handsome Hero. Innocent, Beautiful, Smart, Feisty, Imperiled Heroine. Evil, Twisted Villain. BLEH!<br /><br />And last but not least, \\"love conquering all\\" - especially passionate, panting love and supposedly hot,erotic sex in the face of patently ridiculous circumstances. I bought the hype - I bit - bought all three books. So I got through them and frankly, I wasn't all that entertained. Oh well.
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King continues to amaze me. This book sits alongside \\"The Stand\\" and \\"It\\" as long, great reads that you don't want to put down. Unlike those two books, however, this one doesn't deal as much in the horror genre as more of \\"what if?\\". It's sci fi, historical fiction, and romance rolled into one. It had me going to the history books as well.
0345803493|2.0|I kept on reading after the first book in the series, even though every fiber of my intellect (and my gut) said \\"stop!\\"  Ah, but did I listen? Nope. Made it through this second book so I could trudge through the third and last one. I sometimes sacrifice smarts for dogged stubbornness. You know, there's a point at which even hot, erotic sex becomes BOR-ing! And this book did NOT provide hot, erotic sex - either BDSM or plain old vanilla. Maybe the characters are having a great time - maybe even the author - but for the rest of us, mmmmm...not so (yawn!) much.
B004AGI2L4|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I rented Centurion -- I hadn't been expecting much, but it's a sharply made, smart film with an excellent cast, great scenery, and an engaging story. The Blu-Ray really does the visuals justice; the gorgeous scenery, the incredible detail work on the costumes -- even the nighttime scenes are clear and visible. For those who enjoyed the movie, this blu-ray is certainly worth the price and is mach sharper and clearer than the DVD.
0345803507|3.0|I made it through all three books, maybe because I figured since I'd already bought them, I might as well find out what finally became of Christian and Anastasia. No big surprises, at least for me. I have to remember that every book on the NYT Best Seller List is not necessarily there because it's great literature or even a compelling read.
0785162348|5.0|Like everyone else, I was pleasantly impressed by The Avengers, and I loved the production design in the movie. I read a few reviews here on Amazon, but it was really the high quality of the Thor movie art book that swayed me. This book is as good as that one; each character has his own design section, and there are several pages devoted to the incredible SHIELD Helicarrier. Personally I was pleased that there weren't too many set drawings, and that the book focused predominantly on the characters and gear. The section on the lackluster aliens in thankfully small, and the section on the Hulk was a highlight. For fans of the film who have any interest in production design, this book is certainly worth your investment, especially at Amazon's price.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I came across the recommendation for this book in the Kindle store.  I am so glad that I was able to read it in the \\"omnibus\\" edition; I don't think I would have liked waiting for the installments!  This is an incredible story.  It's well written, well thought out, and the characters are well developed.  The fact that it was written by a relatively new author made me appreciate it even more. I was immediately drawn in to the story and devastated with the turn of events at the end of the first \\"book\\".  It hooked me right away.  If you are a fan of sci fi, or have gravitated toward the latest trend of dystopian novels, do yourself a favor and read \\"Wool\\".  A quality read.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|This film should have received the Oscar in the year it was nominated and not Forrest Gump! It's simply a wonderful story and it relates to everyone who's been in jail for a minor misdemeanor or for something thy didn't do. Men's justice is blind!
B002M9WW30|5.0|Rocky-Rocky Balboa how can you go wrong...  The best movie series ever and in bluray.  Great price, quick delivery. ROCKY, ROCKY, ROCKY!!!
B004QL7K8E|5.0|This movie was a total blast! It's the party you could have only dreamed to be at. You probably won't enjoy this movie if you are over a specific age bracket given the extremes of the following: degrading language, electronic music, female nudity, sexuality, drug use and ridiculous antics, just saying. It's kinda American Pieish. Just turn your brain off and go along for one crazy ride, and don't expect a deep story line or character development or blah, blah, blah. Party to the break of dawn, yo!
B000FC146C|5.0|I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it tremendously.  Loved it so much I wanted to have it on Kindle.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I found this app thinking this would be great for my eight year old son. Great graphics and very engaging but after a couple of days I found that I had been charged several times and I didn't know it. Very misleading in fact I removed and will not recommend this game to anyone unless you are willing to spend lots of money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game provides endless fun because (and I actually checked this) it has 124 games and tons of types. from action to puzzle. has a fun points system too.

0345803493|4.0|First off, if you haven't heard of these books...Where have you been? Second, make sure you check out my review for Fifty Shades of Grey.  Third, please realize that this is a BDSM romance book, so there is some graphic nature to this book.<br /><br />Alright let's talk about Fifty Shades Darker, I was so excited when I finally got my paperback copies of these books.  I had already read the first book in the series so I started reading the second book right away.<br /><br />Adult books like the Fifty Shades Trilogy aren't usually what I read/review but, i couldn't help myself.  Fifty Shades Darker lived up to the hype in my eyes.  I loved this one just as much as the first one.  Fifty Shades Darker picks right back up where Fifty Shades of Grey left off, not leaving a single gap in between.<br /><br />As I read more about Anna and Christan I pulled for them to get back together.  I found myself begging for it.  Once they were they of course had so much to work through and this book shows them doing that.  Just like the first book, I really enjoyed reading their emails back in forth.  Plus in this book Christian is still battling with his past demons and Anna is trying her best to prove herself in the publishing world.<br /><br />I will say the timeline in this book threw me a bit for a loop.  But sometimes life actually works like this and things happen fast before your eyes, so I just went with it.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Darker had me laughing one minute and crying the next.  Especially when everyone thinks he is gone, that scene just about killed me.  I'm sure it will do the same for you.  Warning through, at some points I wanted to scream and throw my book because I was so made with the characters, but that to me makes it a great book. This series is very addicting as you follow their relationship, so if you haven't read these books, just give tit a try you might actually like them.  I know I do!
B000002JEV|5.0|THIS IS GREAT. The first song will hit you like a Mike Tyson body punch. WOW, they were a great band. There are multiple versions of some stuff here, but it's all good. The first disc is intense. It is wild, loud, tight, hot, and everything that you could possibly want from Zeppelin. It is not a standard live album, so the sound quality is NOT shot, you DO NOT hear crowds sometimes breaking into the music you're hearing, and there are not sometimes big delays between songs nor big silent gaps during the songs for the band to stretch out. With the second disc there are some silent gaps with the nearly 20-minute version of \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" but that's definitely a Zeppelin trademark. I thought Jimmy's guitar should have been louder on the version of \\"Black Dog,\\" but it's good anyway. Yes indeed, this is worth the price of purchase. HOT STUFF.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good game.  Easy way to pass the time and my daughter loves that there is so much to choose from&hellip;now that I opened most if it!
B00795P4EG|5.0|amazing ability to remove telephone poles, fence boards,  pretty much anything you want from a photo. Totally worth the price.
0345525558|1.0|All of the characters suffer the effects of abuse and mental illness.  None are particularly believable or likeable, especially the narrator.  The story is full of unbelievable events and magical solutions.  It is fun to think about the language of flowers, but this story is no fun at all.
0345803485|1.0|I have  never written a review before but as an avid reader feel compelled.  Halfway through and I'm stopping-the writing is so bad the story so repetitive I can't go on.  Honestly it's Bella and Edward but he's a billionaire not a vampire and every chapter is essentially the same.  It just gets painful after a while.<br /><br />For well written erotica try the Beauty series!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|By this stage, it's really just hard to believe anyone's life is THIS exciting. There's nothing really new to read about and it's all just very trite and tired. Haven't even bothered to finish this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|its the best game I have on my kindle fire great graghics great controls you have to by this game if you don't your crazy
0425263908|3.0|I got this book after thoroughly enjoying the Fifty Shades Trilogy thinking it would be up to the same great reading.  I was sadly mistaken.  I found the story line being more vulgar than the trilogy, don't really like that, and it started off right away with Gideon coming on to Eva which was a little hard to take since they didn't even know each other.  Yes, this book is different with both Eva and Gideon having their past issues, but it sounded like the author of this book had read 50 Shades and tried to go with the same storyline, changing very little and not giving the readers a little time to get to know both people before throwing them into the troubled relationship.  Not sure if I will go onto the second book, Bared to You didn't read as smoothly as the trilogy did, wasn't really that impressed. Hard to improve on prefection with the 50 Shades Trilogy, will keep looking.....
0061906220|5.0|I bought this for my step sons, 2 and 4. They love with Pete the cat! This book was well written and very entertaining for children. I am going to get the other books in the series.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|The movie was given to me as a gift for Father's Day and I was a little nervous wondering if I would really like it. I thought I would like it after seeing all of the trailers for the movies and many people online who said they liked it have enjoyed the movie for the same reasons I thought I would. They said it was a fun adventure that had some great special effects. However, it received mixed reviews upon release and it did not do well at the box office. After viewing it I have to say I really liked it!<br /><br />I am not going to go into great detail about the movie but I will say what I did and didn't like about the movie. In the beginning there is a short prolog that tells the story of the conflicts between the civilizations on Mars, known as Barsoom to the natives. I wish that part was just a little clearer because for a while it was confusing for me to understand who was who and what was going on. I also think the early part of the movie before John Carter arrives on Mars could have fleshed out his character a little better. However, once you are on Mars and the confusion clears up the movie is very enjoyable with good character development with both John Carter and Dejah Thoris, a Princess of Mars who must enter into an arranged marriage in order to resolve the global conflicts. When John Carter arrives on Mars he is captured by a very tall green skinned multi-limb race of humanoids called Tharks. This warrior tribe eventually assists John Carter in his aid to save Dejah Thoris. John Carter's character development is an essential part of the story as his motivation goes from wanting to leave Mars and return to Earth to falling in love with Dejah Thoris and wanting to rescue her and resolve the planet's civil discord.<br /><br />I found as the movie goes along it gets better and better and really becomes an exciting action and adventure movie. I don't want to put too many spoilers in my review but the movie did hit a slight snag for me toward the end. Spoiler alert for the next part if you haven't seen the film: When John Carter gets transported back to earth against his will, his journey to return to Mars seems rushed. It also resolves some of the confusion form the opening of the movie, which is in reality setting up the ending. Its not that this part of the movie was bad, it wasn't, its just that coming so late in the movie the pace of it seems hurried.<br /><br />I wanted to make a comment about leading actor Taylor Kitsch as John Carter. There have been some complaints that he has been miscast because he doesn't portray a larger than life persona one would want in a warrior hero. To some extent that is true. His screen presence is not the best. Yet in the framework of the film it works. He is supposed to be just an average guy that is placed in extraordinary circumstances. When John Carter defeats the Giant white gorillas and Tal Hajus you finally see the larger than life warrior emerge. As I stated that is later in the film. All in all Taylor Kitsch is fine for the role of John Carter.<br /><br />Although I really enjoyed the movie it does have some flaws, which all movies do, and I do not think that it is bad at all. The saddest part for me is that the ending sets us up for a sequel and the movie really cries for one but with the poor performance at the box office we will probably never see one.alert for the next part if you haven't seen the film: When John Carter gets transported back to earth against his will, his journey to return to Mars seems rushed.

B005URRCUY|5.0|This album is full off testosterone and funky grooves.  Definitely a beat you can dance to...even if it's just yourself.  The guitar feels raw and unclean...unprocessed.  You won't hear any autotunning on this album. The vocals are crisp and palatable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Darker is easily my favorite of the series.  James is highly imaginative and creative and everything gets crazier in Book 2.  It is here where we see more character development and growth in and between Christian and Ana.  The writing is much better and is easier to read than in Book 1.  Like I said in my review for Book 1, make sure you have Book 3 ready and waiting!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Very easy to use interface and it processes the image effects very quickly on my Galaxy Tab 7 Plus. Seems to have good social media integration too.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades is a great start to hook you into the whole series.  Beware- if you read Book 1, you will NEED to have Books 2 and 3 handy and on deck.  I would have given this book 5-stars, except the writing is absolutely terrible.  Please don't read it expecting to read a well-written novel, because it is not as such.  And it is repetitive....and it is repetitive.  However, books 2 and 3 are much better.<br /><br />Now with that said, it was easy to overlook these shortcomings and take it for what it is- a fun and fantastic summer read.  I must admit, I read it just because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about.  48 hours later...I knew I was addicted and had to complete the series.  If you are looking for a book to get lost in and to take your mind away from the now, this will not disappoint.  Stow you twitchy palm and read on and enjoy!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The app complained that there is a bug in the Kindle Fire Operating System preventing opening images from the gallery. Nice to know, I'm sure, but I DON'T HAVE A KINDLE FIRE.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Freed is the most suspenseful of the three books.  (Almost to the `stressing me out' point!)  At this stage in the story line, the sex that appears on every third page doesn't seem as new and exciting but the characters would not be the same without it.  Freed is also the most Twilight reminiscent of the three, but again, just remember that this is not Edward and Bella and Jacob, and take it with a grain of salt.  I especially enjoyed the look into Christian's point of view.  He is not that tortured of a soul after all and yes, he does have a heart.<br /><br />Again, a fantastic and quick read that will hijack your mind to a place filled with boats, designer shoes, and oh yes, handcuffs.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|almost as good as if not better than ps Mobile. esDot is doing a great job with this app. keep it coming...

B0054JZC6E|5.0|My son likes the option of earning points as &quot;dollars &quot; so you can &quot;buy&quot; more games. He says that it's a lot of fun. So far he's been playing it for almost 90 minutes, so I'm guessing he's onto something.  So far no complaints!
B005LAIGLO|2.0|Wanted to buy this movie when it first came out, decided to go the rent option instead to check it out.  The movie plot is real slow and will find yourself wanting to fast forward through the movie.  Could've been a lot better and was disappointed with how it all turned out.
B004TI5N38|4.0|A delightfully entertaining book. I hated to see it end and wondered about a possible sequel. Baldacci is always a dependably interesing writer & he did not disappoint this time.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I'm a pretty big fan of Sherlock Holmes and the stories that Conan Doyle wrote. I enjoyed the Jeremy Brett series, generally hated Basil Rathbone, and have enjoyed the 2 Robert Downey movies...so when this series came out, I was curious, to say the least.<br /><br />It's a completely different take. Rather than attempt to redo the stories authentically (as they did with the Jeremy Brett stuff) or re-imagine them in steampunk London at the turn of the last century (as they did with the Guy Ritchie films that star Robert Downey Jr.) they've essentially translated Sherlock Holmes to modern-day London, complete with an expertise in computers, and rumors that Sherlock and his flat-mate, Dr. Watson, are gay lovers. The whole thing is amusing as hell, and there are constant references to the original Conan Doyle stories. In one memorable sequence a very nerdy guy says a bunch of stuff, and then someone else translates for him--and that's \\"The Geek Interpreter\\", a reference to a short story titled \\"The Greek Interpreter\\" which the show's producers have apparently decided isn't suitable for adaptation to the modern world.<br /><br />My only complaint about this show is that it's way too short. Where else but England could a TV network have a \\"series\\" that has \\"seasons\\" that last 3 episodes? In America we call that a \\"mini-series\\". Seriously, they need to get their act together. The producers apparently weren't quite prepared for how well the show did this year on American TV, because they've already decided (because of scheduling conflicts with the stars, etc.) not to do the next season for another year and a half. Eventually, they'll have enough hours to fill one full season of an American TV show...hopefully.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is one of those games/toys where you play it and think 'why the heck didn't I come up with this?'  It's so simple (learn it in 10 seconds) and so much fun. It's even more fun the more people you have playing. It's a simple push your luck dice game but it's a blast. Perhaps it's the theme (and it's popularity right now) that makes the game so special.<br /><br />If you can't have fun playing this, you're dead inside. Which is pretty much exactly what a zombie is... Buy it!

B0086700CM|5.0|addicted to it on my ipod, now im addicted to it on my kindle. glad they put it on the kindle market place and it deserves a 4-5 star rating
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Really enjoy playing this game...the only problems I have had is trying to visit neighbors and the cost of expanding your land goes up drastically each time. Need to improve the rate that you can earn acorns also. Love the graphics and the movies. Animals are cute!
B00633PFQC|5.0|I'm sure the latest book by Michael Sandel will generate controversy, particularly because it dares raising serious questions about the dominant free market ideology of the past few decades. Sandel is no anti-market luddite, and understands that capitalism has been and still is an engine for economic prosperity. But, as any good philosopher would do, he is looking at the broader question, at what happens when economics turns into an all-encompassing approach to human relations, relations whose worth is measured with the single common currency of hard cash. Sandel's point is that market values sometimes interfere with ethical values, and that whenever that is the case we ought to ask the hard questions about why we do certain things (like having children, going to sports events and so on) and what we value about them. It's a very Aristotelian / virtue ethics approach to ethical discourse, and one that is all the more important in a modern society whose problems are becoming too complex to be handled by more rigid ethical doctrines, like utilitarianism or deontology. Sandel's approach is the same one he used so effectively in his previous book, Justice: What's the Right Thing To Do? He doesn't begin with lofty moral theory, but with actual examples from everyday life or from the news, and then works his way to the general principles that inform our ethical decision making. At one extreme, it should be obvious that there is no problem at all with certain things being for sale: you want to buy a car, someone else wishes to sell his; as long as the transaction is fair and between consenting adults, there is no problem. At the opposite extreme things should be equally as clear: it is not acceptable, morally, under any circumstances, to sell one's children (or anyone else, really) in slavery. Period, regardless of how much pressure \\"the market\\" may exert, or how advantageous the transaction would be, even to the slave. That's because slavery is a mortal blow to human dignity, and because we have moral duties toward our children that include not selling them for profit. The difficult issues, then, are somewhere in the middle: is it ok to buy your place in a queue even though that means that less rich people will never get to see an allegedly public Congressional hearing? Is it acceptable to sell your organs for profit? What about naming rights to public places, including schools and parks? Regardless of whether you'll end up agreeing or not with Sandel, reading the book will make you think hard about what you value and why. Which is the whole point of the exercise.ty, and because we have moral duties toward our children that include not selling them for profit.

B006OB3K56|1.0|Where to begin?  Do we care about these self absorbed idiots? Nope.  Is there any character developement that would make me care?  Nope.  Is there a story line that makes any sense at all?  Nope.<br />So...what do we have?  We have a really \\"D\\" rated sex film that was mass-marketed to the general audience.  It is disgusting.<br /><br />Oh, if you like to look at female breasts...and fake sex scenes...well, then, this is the blockbuster for you.<br /><br />However...if you really had hoped to see a story about character development and a true story...well, then you had better skip this piece of junk.<br /><br />It is horrible.<br /><br />I seriously think Amazon should give \\"zero\\" stars...for total junk.  I didn't even hate this film...it is totally worthless.  Do not waste your time or money.<br /><br />\\"Shame\\" on you, Steve McQueen.  Disgusting.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|Love this new album - I've been a fan from the first album she put out, and haven't been disappointed yet.  The best part is, you never know if she's going to put out another one, so when she does, it's so exciting!  What a great artist.<br /><br />The album has a fabulous, gritty feeling - I think Fiona is putting herself out there more and fighting her instincts to stay safe in her hermit-like cocoon, and that really come through in the lyrics and stylistic choices on the record.  I'm digging the minimalism and raw vocals on many of the songs. And I have to admit, I'm totally hooked on the last track, which is an uncharacteristic surprise from Fiona!<br /><br />Hope we'll see another album in a decade or less.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The author transported me to the world of the Hunger Games.  I found it hard to put down.  I read this because my 10 year old niece was reading it, however, and personally felt it, as well as the final book of the trilogy, were too violent for that age.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Hey, Laura Izabor and Melanie Fiona...would you mind if Rebecca Ferguson sat here and had lunch with you?  I think that you three would get along just fine.  Now, on to the review.  This lady's voice is strong and soulful and the combination with the right music just put it all in place.  She has her own style, but throughout the disc, I kept being reminded of Laura and Melanie, and as much as I love them, that's high praise indeed.  She seems true to her material and, I must say it again, that voice!  She has a range that's making me want her to hurry up and drop her follow-up!  It's easy to see how she won THE X-FACTOR competition, and it's easier to see how, with the right management by her side, how she'll win over the music industry.  Hey, she's already got me.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|There are some good ideas here, like the combination of the video game Breakout with a more tradional pinball table. But, I found the controls to be less responsive then is acceptable. Having controls that sort of work, kind of, sometimes, is not going to get it done. In short, there is still work to be done. Update it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This will go down as an epic RUSH album. If you were at the last tour the first two song will be familiar with a little change, but as good as ever. Then they take you through an incredible melodic and metal journey with every member of the band taking their skills to the next level. At one point you feel like the bassline owns the album, then Alex pops in with stream that blows your mind. All being done as Neil continues his greatness. If you've enjoyed RUSH in the past, especially mid 70's to late 80's RUSH, that era is back and dare I say, better.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Nice features so I thought I'd give it a try.  Attempted to open a picture from gallery and a notice comes up, &quot;Woops, there is a bug with Kindle Fire....&quot; then you tap Okay which does nothing.  Um my Asus Transformer isn't using the Kindle OS so don't urge me to contact Amazon.  The problem is the app itself so quit blaming others and fix it.  Fix for more stars.  I would give zero just for the blame game if I could.
B004LWZW88|5.0|I liked this DVD format because I don't own a blue ray player but might get one in the future.  This DVD can be played on a regular DVD player and also came with the Blue Ray one so that when we do make that purchase we'll be all set.  I wish more DVDs would do that.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I ordered my cover for my kindle and the product works great. Only problem was I ordered pink and received black.  I was leaving town so I just used the black one (although it's not nearly as cute!)  Still a good product though!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app helps strengthen your relationship with God. since it is so accessible it makes reading the Bible a easy and pleasurable experience.
B008469DGY|4.0|This game is very addictive and fun. My dad likes playing even more than I do. I can't play much because he is always playing it.
B005EWDAFQ|4.0|I must say i found the book quite \\"unputdownable\\", the story keeps you riveted. Also gives some insight about modern securities trading methods (altough not so sure if so called algorithmic trading is as refined as the story says it is - but that's ok, it's part of the story). However the ending left me puzzled. Honestly not quite sure what the author is saying. Probably just me, not being up to the writer's technique.I still recommend it as a good compulsive read.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome trilogy. For a new author these books were outstanding. Really loved the storyline and characters. Would like to see more of the same kind of books from this author.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|i think this awesome but could be better if the kindle had a camera and if you had more options
B004132HZS|5.0|The quality of the DVD is excellent, and of course, the story is amazing. I loved seeing it on the TV instead of on my laptop. I was really excited to have this and show my friends and hopefully convert more fans :)
B004XNGKBS|5.0|this works well. I love that u can draw the letters as well type. I would recamend this to peeps who injoy wrighting.
B00000AFGM|5.0|I enjoy listening to Manson's albums no matter what the sound of them. If you're like me and don't care what kind of sound Manson produces with each album, this is definitely worth the money and the listen. My favorite songs have to be:<br /><br />1 Great Big White World<br /><br />2 The Dope Show<br /><br />3 Rock is Dead<br /><br />4 I don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)<br /><br />and 5 Coma White *This song is by far my favorite on the album.*<br /><br />I've only been listening to Manson's music since mid 2010 but I grew up with it as a kid due to my older sisters constantly playing his music. So I know what his sound is and no matter what direction he goes on his albums I enjoy all of them from the AS album to the new Born Villain and everything in between. The first album I purchased when I got started on his music was \\"The High End of Low\\" which many will say wasn't a very good album and I have to disagree. Some good songs from that album would have to be \\"Pretty as a ($)\\", \\"Arma-Godd***-Motherf***in-Geddon\\", \\"Running to the Edge of the World\\", and \\"We're from America\\".<br /><br />I recommend this album to any true Manson Fan who enjoys all his eras of music. The album itself has a sort of softer sound going in the opposite direction of his normal \\"Suicide Rock\\" as many classify it. It may be a softer sound but it still has a tremendous amount of emotion put into it.
1878424319|5.0|A friend loaned me her copy of this book, and I loved it. Mr. Ruiz is a gifted writer.<br />These are my comments to her after reading the book. 'It is a very well written, succint, and edifying if not elucidating treatise.<br />He has taken general principles of psychology, philosophy, etc., and woven them into a very readable and workable common sense approach to self improvement and enlightenment. It reminded me of things and reinforces most of which I know and try to live by.<br /><br />It's interesting that human nature is a constant, regardless of when or in what society people live in.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I really like it! It lets me edit then post to Facebook! It's great! It's. basicly on the go! Very Cool!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I must admit that I couldn't put this book down.  It had me completely spellbound.  It certainly is not a book to read for someone that doesn't have an open mind about human sexuality. This book is sexually graphic but is entwined with a story line.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really fun &amp; addicting. u should totally get this game! have to fill word requirement, blab, blab, blah
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good reading.  I enjoyed reading this book but, throughout the story, it seemed to be building to a great ending but then, abruptly, came to a short, simple and unimpressive conclusion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a fun game I just wish there was another way to get acorns besides buying them. other than that its super fun
B00407PNWO|5.0|What a great movie. I just loved the story. This is a great movie for all true romantics. I like how back in those days the romances weren't vulgar. This movie is just full of; excitement, romance, humor, and adventure. It's so great that I want to watch this movie again and again.
B0086700CM|4.0|a lot of fun to be had.  a couple gripes on the menu navigation, you can accidentally spend coins pretty easily.  occasionally the game seems non.responsive, not sure if that's the game or the kindle.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|addictive, challenging, and fun. It is challenging than the description. I have had the app for one day and I 'm hooked. Works great on Kindle Fire.
B00884GR0W|2.0|I don't have this yet but why cant someone make a minecraft. Not Eden minecraft.It would something everybody likes. (5 stars). Easy
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Amazon you need to allow 0 stars. When an app does not  even start how is it worth one star.<br /><br />It's a good application, when you get it from google play store.<br /><br />Need I say more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome. you have to earn coins to unlock games but the app also gives you random coin gifts for all kinds of stuff, to coming back everyday to persistance on beating the games. I strongly reccomend this app &amp; give it 5 stars.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and enjoyed every minute of it!  I don't get how some people were let down by the dialouge because I have seen many a poorly written and acted movies but this is NOT one of them.  While I was watching I never got the sense that any line was forced or badly delivered.  I have seen may interviews and programs about these brave warriors and what I saw on the screen was exactly what those being interviewed came across as,  dedicated members of our military who think not of themselves but of those they serve with and will do anything to complete the mission and make sure that their other team members, not themselves, get home safely.  While the movie itself is fiction, I know many of the scenes are based on real life events from various missions during the war on terror because I remember reading about them in the paper or doing researching after having seen the movie.  It was great way to spend an afternoon and know afterwards that the people in this movie are out there keeping us safe.
B007TBCTRK|2.0|Prometheus sees the eagerly-awaited and highly anticipated return to the Alien franchise of director Ridley Scott, whose groundbreaking science fiction films in the late 1970s and early 80s help shaped the genre as we know it today. While not a direct prequel to his 1979 masterpiece, the film does take place before the events of that classic film, and within the same general universe. However, whereas the original Alien was essentially a haunted house movie in space, Prometheus asks bigger questions about the meaning - and origins - of life itself. Noomi Rapace and and Logan Marshall-Green star as a pair of scientists who, via some ancient cave paintings, discover a \\"star map\\" which they think will lead them across the universe to where life on Earth began. Years later, the pair arrive on a distant planet with a cadre of associates funded by the Weyland corporation: icy administrator Charlize Theron, ship's captain Idris Elba, geologist Rafe Spall, biologist Sean Harris, plus a sentient android named David, played with clinical conviction by Michael Fassbender. However, upon their arrival and initial forays onto the planet, the team find much more than they anticipated, and a great deal of danger.<br /><br />The Alien franchise has a storied and impressive musical heritage, from Jerry Goldsmith on the original Alien, through James Horner on Aliens, Elliot Goldenthal on Alien 3, and John Frizzell on Alien Resurrection, as well as Brian Tyler and Harald Kloser on the Alien-Predator crossovers. It must have been a daunting task for German composer Marc Streitenfeld to step into this arena, not only with the weight of previous composers to consider, but with the added pressure of Prometheus being one of the most highly anticipated films in years. Having only scored seven films since making his debut in 2006, there was really nothing in his filmography to suggest that he had the composing chops necessary to step up to the task, and unfortunately this proves to be true. His score is a murky, surprisingly pedestrian orchestral/electronic hybrid which clearly tries to pick up the mantle of his predecessors, but has nowhere near the technical or compositional excellence that Goldsmith, Horner and Goldenthal brought to their orchestral/electronic hybrids.<br /><br />In fact, it seems that Streitenfeld's music actually suffered a similar fate to that of his peers. It is well-known that at least three of the prior composers had terrible experiences writing their Alien scores: Ridley Scott replaced much of Jerry Goldsmith's score with classical pieces and re-arranged the rest out of sequence; James Horner and James Cameron almost came to blows on the scoring stage of Aliens, and Elliot Goldenthal suffered so much studio interference that his Alien 3 score was altered beyond recognition in the final cut. Streitenfeld's ignominy is in having the bulk of his thematic material replaced with music by Harry Gregson-Williams in the finished picture; Gregson-Williams' \\"Life\\" theme is by far the standout musical element in the film, and features at least half a dozen times during some of the movie's most pivotal moments. The theme - which features on the soundtrack album in \\"Life\\" and \\"We Were Right\\" - is a noble, optimistic melody for horns and strings augmented by a light choral element, and is quite beautiful, although its use in context seems rather muddled: it's almost as though Scott, realizing his movie didn't have a strong musical identity, simply stuck Gregson-Williams's theme in wherever he felt the need for a memorable musical moment, irrespective of what the scene was or whether the use of that theme at that moment actually made narrative sense. Nevertheless, the theme is lovely, and will undoubtedly go on to become the most remembered musical aspect of the film.<br /><br />The rest of Streitenfeld's score is a surprisingly uninvolving affair, and despite the presence of three new themes and a couple of smaller motifs and recurring performance techniques, it never really lingers long in the memory or generates much of an individual identity. There's a suitably large orchestra, and a whole bank of synthesizers and electronic textures to add otherworldly ambiences, but on the whole it fails to truly establish itself beyond its own narrow scope, instead content to mirror the action with creepy vignettes of suspense and a couple of explosions of noise for the action sequences.<br /><br />A main theme of sorts is heard in the opening \\"A Planet\\", and crops up again in later cues such as \\"Small Beginnings\\", \\"Dazed\\" and \\"Collision\\"; it shares some of the same harmonic language as Gregson-Williams's theme, with the two almost seeming to merge together in cues such as the rather impressive \\"Earth\\", but in context it fades into the background whenever the \\"Life\\" theme comes to the fore, making it seem curiously unresolved and understated. A see-sawing four-note danger motif (not like Horner's) appears in \\"Going In\\", \\"Not Human\\", \\"Too Close\\", \\"Hyper Sleep\\", and several other cues to represent the unknown but omnipresent threats facing the crew of the Prometheus, although the instrumentation and layers of sound accompanying the motif tend to make it difficult to identify. Often, Streitenfeld uses what sounds like a processed bass flute to bring this motif to life, which lends the score an unexpected 1970s flavor, before the grinding synthesizers and other industrial groans and moans quickly bring it back into the present.<br /><br />In some cues, notably \\"David\\", Streitenfeld manipulates his music to give it an abstract, oddly detached feeling, which he achieved by having his orchestra play the music backwards and reversing the sound in post-production. Also in this cue, and in cues such as \\"Small Beginnings\\", there's a staccato pulse beating under the music, a little like a mechanical heartbeat, but which Streitenfeld describes as `the sound of blood rushing through your ears', which acts as something of a recurring tone to represent David's synthetic nature. Elsewhere, the music establishes a rhythmic undercurrent to give the score a sense of forward motion, whereupon Streitenfeld layers on various blocks of dissonant orchestral noise, adopting a \\"wall of sound\\" approach to overwhelm listeners during action scenes. Cues such as \\"Hammerpede\\", the opening parts of \\"Infected\\", \\"Hello Mommy\\", \\"Dazed\\" and \\"Planting the Seed\\" adopt this style, which is effective enough, but seems more than a little overly-familiar.<br /><br />A large-scale final theme, which seems to musically represent the God-like power employed by the Engineers, is first performed on noble brasses in the opening cue \\"A Planet\\", and appears again as a leitmotif for the Final Engineer in the powerful \\"Space Jockey, the noble and resilient \\"Collision\\" and the conclusive \\"Birth\\". One final conceit is a processed restatement of Jerry Goldsmith's original theme for Alien in \\"Friend from the Past\\", which underscores a pivotal scene of exposition and is a nice nod and a wink to the old master. The majority of film-goers won't even notice it, but I liked the tribute.<br /><br />As much as Prometheus works well enough in context, Streitenfeld's work on this score really doesn't live up to its pre-release hype, and will not be remembered as well as any of the others in the pantheon of Alien scores. As much as I don't like questioning a composer's credentials, I do have to wonder whether hiring a comparatively green composer like Streitenfeld was a wise idea for a film of this magnitude; it's likely that the assignment was simply too big for him, and having heard his small contribution, one can't help but wonder what Harry Gregson-Williams or someone like him would have done with a canvas like this. It's a shame; much like the film it accompanies, it promised much, but delivers less.

B008CPZNL6|4.0|I've been waiting for Flipboard to come to Android and this port does not disappoint. The version for the Kindle Fire has the same innovative interface as the iPhone. Read news feeds, Twitter and Facebook quickly and easily. Well done.
0156027321|2.0|When I first read the book's description I became excited: \\"A story that will make you believe in God\\". I thought, well, let's give it a chance. Maybe this book can wipe out my doubts about Its existence. However, this excitement didn't last very long. It is a very long story given the little content that the author has to share with the reader. Spending many months in a boat, at the open sea, can become extremely boring, not only for the main character but also for anyone enduring the many pages of the book. Because the book is really  long and basically about a castaway and how he tries to survive.<br />The author makes a very unexpected twist towards the end, which becomes a turning point that, for some people, allows you to comprehend the metaphor of religion, whichever it may be. Personally, I need so much more to start \\"believing\\".<br />Regarding the argument in itself, Life of Pi is the story of a young Indian man who tries to emigrate to Canada with his family in search of a better life. Unfortunately, something goes wrong with the ship and he finds himself in a boat, struggling to survive in the ocean.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|The Pumpkins have always been so closely associated with leader Billy Corgan, that even without any other founding members left, their latest album still sounds exactly like.....Billy Corgan. Unfortunately, though, while the bass and guitar of D'Arcy and James Iha has been missing without effect for the last several, often excellent S.P. albums, this time around it's drummer Jimmy Chamberlain who has flown the coop, and that's my biggest problem with this album. His drumming defined the Pumpkins sound, and without it, we're basically left with (another) Corgan/ZWAN solo album. And as a solo album, it certainly has its Pumpkin-y moments, but unlike the last album, the excellent \\"Zeitgeist\\", which was propelled by Chamberlain's hard-hitting percussive attack, this album is just sort of....typical of Corgan, rather ordinary, and not particularly 'heavy'. It all reminds me of those sixties bands who tour years later with one original member. This is basically \\"Billy Corgan's Smashing Pumpkins\\" now.

B005LAIHY0|4.0|I finally got around to seeing this film in a theater. I was delighted to have the option of seeing it in normal format instead of 3-D. 3-D glasses fight with my own and make the experience awful.<br /><br />This film moves at a fairly slow pace but the visuals - the scenery - are great to see. Not much in the way of interpersonal conflict here, just a little. The music didn't make an impression, in fact I don't remember anything about music except that it wasn't used to cover up bad film making as is too often the case.<br /><br />The film ends with a great tease for sequels. I'm glad somebody survived. I'm glad the specific somebody survived. That's one tough scientist.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like the game I had a lot of fun playing it keep up the good work will deffenteny be playing it again
0099579936|5.0|I loved this book. I am not one into reading such books that go into such great detail about sex. I couldn't keep my hands off or remove my eyes from the book. I felt like I was on the edge of my seat and times I wanted to jump into the book. I fell inlove with the love story! Yes it's poorly written but it's a great book
B0086700CM|4.0|I love the game but sometimes the graphics just suck other than that I think the is really nice. Hope u find this helpful.
B003UD7JEE|1.0|This series is stylish in many ways - obvioulsy not cheap and the acting is ok. The editing and picture quality even better.<br /><br />But yet another show with some man-killing \\"heroine\\"? Really? We have seen it all before - in Kill Bill, Dark Angel, Bionic Woman, Salt, Charlies Angels, Buffy for the younger audience... I could go on and on. This is just a new packaging.<br /><br />A sexy strong female where the plot just serves as an excuse for her to finish off less strong men (hundreds of them). It is actually very feministic and misandrist in that sense. Doesn`t work for me. I value men.
0345803507|4.0|I bought the set.I have read better. There are very humorous parts of each book which they needed. All in all they were a fun read but a little of the same over and over
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|Good grief! I was a cop for several years and none of the other women on the department could have passed for super models, or dared to dress like Beckett does unless they were on vice detail.<br /><br />Yet, seeing Beckett parade around in skin tight mini skirts and plunging necklines (such as her role as the Russian girlfriend!) is so ridiculous it adds to the hilarity of the series. But it takes away any possibility of taking the show seriously. Then again, I suppose if I want reality, I'll watch old episodes of Police Story.<br /><br />The dialogue is fast paced and well written (a rariety today) and both primary the secondary actors are excellent. The plotlines are complex without becoming Byzantine. And I ****LOVE**** the inclusion of Castle's daughter and mother. That was a bit of genius on the part of the writers. Without them, Castle would be so one-dimensional he's be uninteresting.<br /><br />I've put my order in for season 2 and hope they can sustain the level of entertainment ...

B008CPZNL6|1.0|Having been a Pulse user since it was native on my Kindle Fire, I was excited to download and use Flipboard.  The main reason is because Pulse limits the amount of feeds one can have.  Perhaps I'm a little OC, but I want my feeds organized into categories, such as all my preferred news feeds under \\"news,\\" etc.  Although I can add whichever feeds I want to Flipboard, one cannot move them around like can be done in Pulse.  There's a lot of extraneous content in the app as well, making this user feel like I'm having to flip through a magazine full of articles I don't want, just to find the ones I subscribe to.  Perhaps there will be an update and when I can organize my feeds and get rid of the extraneous ones, I will be a loyal user.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is wonderful. I'm having so much fun editing pictures of my nieces and all kinds of things. I love it.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Season 4 starts off like a meth-head with a new teener and doesnt stop,just like the addict until there's nothing left, either of the product or the user(viewer!)The best television series of all time period. The show is so well written and is 1oo% a believeable very real portrayal of something that is happening in every state, city,and neighborhood in America. Watch all 4 seasons and by the first 15 mins u to will b hooked. I cant wait for season 5 and if it does end i will be sad to see it go.But ive got seasons 1-4 and as soon as 5 is available it will be on my self. That way i can at least rewatch whenever i want and still get the same high. If u havn't bought the dvds do yourself a favor and it will be one of the best purchases you ever made. Oh yeah.\\"Hey Jesse,Sunday night bowl yo!\\"
B00785P2QC|2.0|It's a great game if you just want to fool around. Though if you are looking to get into it at a quick pace you will have to spend money. One big thing that i hate is that you are promised extra investment points if you post on your facebook, but the moment you login with facebook you can no longer get those rewards.
0066620996|4.0|It is especially interesting reading this book so far after its publication because the books assessment of  a good company verses a great company hinges on a ranking system of corporations DOW and stock value (as well as other factors).

B004J4WLB4|4.0|We selected this book for our book club and everyone agreed it was worth reading.  We are all in the field of education and have dealt with foster children and foster families many times.  It was interesting to read about the main character's thoughts and opinions about herself.  The book was an easy read and kept one's interest with the various relationships in the book.  Our club also enjoyed the back and forth of the chapters between Victoria as a younger child and now as a young adult.  The book left us with a sense of hope and the desire to continue to listen and be aware of specific comments or emotional actions from our students not only that livr in foster homes but those children who come from what we percieve as dsyfunctional environments.  We discussed how our perception of what is a loving and suppportive family is obviously not the same as what our students consider to be loving. Most of our students love their parents and sibilings no matter how bad the environment seems either physically or emotionally.  We need to not be judgemental but understanding and supportive.  Language of Flowers was a book we would recommend to our friends and family - we all left with a feeling of being so very lucky having the families and friendships we have. I for one am planning to let my friends and families know just how much I love and appreciate them more often - with busy and hetic schedules we assume everyone knows and feels our love but this book brought to the forefront that we also need to commuicate it to them with our words and actions.  Just one last thought - the flowers mentioned in the book and their meanings was so fun to learn about.  The flower dictionary in the back of the book was a great point of discussion!!

B0072OFM28|5.0|This series is one of the most enjoyable I've ever glued my eyes to and also one of the few shows that starts off great and just gets better each week. While everyone is entertained by naked men and women, sex and violence( the fight scene choreography is so different from anything else so far put to screen )one thing remains firm--the writing is extraordinary and the acting meets the challenge. The language is near poetry, and the machinations of the characters are endlessly entertaining---equal to the most magnificent show ever on television I Claudius. I miss terribly John Hannah, who stole the show from day one.Yet the most diabolical characters were Lucretia and Ilythia. They will be surely missed in the final season...unless Lucy's producer/creator husband comes up with a twin sister role for her. Yet I think not because the show must leave behind the small venue of Capua to the big arena ( no pun intended )of Italy itself. Even though we lament that the next season will be the last, we must remember the slave rebellion (the Third Servile War )lasted all of two years. Next comes the maneuvering of Roman senators, Crassus, a young Caesar, the Great Pompey, and Metullus, the First Triumverate.The show tries to be historically accurate as possible within the confines of entertainment, which is why we have the figures Crixus, Gannicus, and Onemaues. It was Crixus who disputed strategy with Spartacus, wanting to return to Gaul (modern day France )instead of escaping by sea via the assistance of Cilesian pirates ( who later on were wiped out by Roman fleets under Pompey)and whose success created a burning rivalry with Caesar.Crixus took about twenty thousand with him, headed north and was exterminated by several Roman legions.Later gaining power Crassus was wiped out by being surrounded by a Parthian host and lost sixty thousand legionnaires.Inadvertenly Spartacus was partially responsible for the decline and end of the Roman Republic.......As far as the conversation of Liam replacing Andy, I had no problem with it because after just rewatching the first season it came to me that Liam had a stronger screen presence than Andy and finer oratory skills and voice quality.Anxiously awaiting season two on dvd and Blu ray and watching the final season next spring.[[ASIN:B007055JQ8 Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series]]
B0062NARCA|1.0|I purchased this UMD cd in error, I don't have any way of playing this type of cd.  I paid about $18 and returned it within the week and received $4 credit.  That's ridiculus!  There was a restocking charge for half the price. This turned out to be an expensive error on my part.  I am not happy with the way this vendor does business.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow!!! Awesome! Great story, so emotion packed! It flowed well and was easy to read.  Definitely worth the read! I could not put this one down!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a good game which requires a little strategy especially in the later levels. high replay value and will keep you interested
B0085RZGYU|5.0|I have now read many David Baldacci books, and I am a huge fan. I'm only half-way through this book, and I love it. I am listening to the audio version, and it is hard to stop...the story is just so good..!  And his writing and command of language are wonderful...!
B007SGM084|1.0|30 bucks for a download?? Ya gotta be kidding!! Free wireless download? Make it 15 and I'll pay you a buck for the download.
B0086700CM|5.0|A great game to pass the time. its even addictive afterwards. I enjoyed it and is continuing to enjoy this game.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Good Fun at the Cinema in 3D.....? If comes out in 3D I will buy it.....? Seems this one at the moment is not in 3D.....?
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun game!  keeps kids entertained constantly.  the help guide be more detailed such as how to feed the animals.  nice graphics.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I downloaded this to my kindle fire,  and it responds berg quickly. I love all of the options and effects, and operating it is anything but complicated....
B000QCS8TW|1.0|At first when I was reading this book I'd every now and then stumble across a misplaced character.  \\"Tom cat\\" became \\"torn cat\\", every now and then a parenthesis would sneak its way in, or a semicolon.<br /><br />Now that I'm about halfway through, it seems like one very other page I encounter at least one instance of incorrect characters.<br /><br />It seems to me that this book was converted to Kindle by means of optical character recognition (OCR).  Whoever was reviewing the OCR job for mistakes wasn't very good in the first place, and it seems about halfway through he or she just gave up.<br /><br />Having to stop and unwind the mystery of the misplaced character is just terrible for immersion.  It's also inexcusable in age when the publisher certainly possesses perfect digital copies of the text.
B0071MQBX0|4.0|This is a very unique performance, a great way of celebrating 25 years of phantom of the opera. I'm a fan and I loved this production, I totally recommend buying the DVD. The only thing that wasn't perfect was some camera angles that did not clearly zoom on the action, but it probably happened because it was filmed from a real performance...anyways overall it is great!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Although I've only tried a few music apps this one seems to work the best for what I need and like, with lots of choices in music, and genres, has not caused me any problems on my phone like the few others I've tried. Glad I got the pro even though the free version was no problem either, but the price for the pro version didn't hurt either.
0307887898|4.0|The information presented in this book is done so in a straightforward and informative way, but I find myself getting bogged down in it a little bit.  It doesn't have the quality that makes you want to keep reading it without putting it down, but neither does it come across as a textbook.<br /><br />Side note: my copy is an uncorrected proof, so there are typos and a number of graphs that are missing, though hopefully these issues will be rectified in the official publication.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Great graphics and excellent game-play but it has the tendency to reset your progress. I think it has something to do with switching wireless networks or low wireless signal.
0345803485|3.0|The book was interesting but repetitive. I think it excites women more than men.I wonder if the next novel in the trilogy will be more of the same.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|Ok Ok I know it's not 100% factually accurate and all that stuff -- but this movie is really really exciting.  It is well filmed and I think the excitement is really intense.  I love the beginning with the quote from the Book Of Job.  I think this is the type of movie where you just sit back and enjoy pure entertainment and it's not really all that far off -- Secretariat was the greatest racehorse of all time and he won the Triple crown -- this movie shows that and the acting is really good.  I love the scenes from my hometown -- Virginia -- we may not be quite as race-saavy as Kentucky but yes, we love horses too!  At any rate, my kids and I absolutely love this movie -- a moving tribute to the greatest racehorse of all time -- from Virginia I might add -- Secretariat, Big Red!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun game great to kill time.<br /><br />it has so many games in it its a Multics app. U should get it its free
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Unlike most of the reviewers here, I did not buy this amp to improve audio quality. The main reason I bought this was to use it as a volume control of sorts on my TV. It lacks a headphone jack, so I bought one of those 2 x RCA Male / 1 x 3.5mm Stereo Female Y-Cables which plugs into the audio outputs, and from there you just plug the headphones into the cable's jack. However, unless the headphones have a volume control, the volume will be at a constant, unchangeable level. Thus, enter the Fiio E6!<br /><br />It felt a bit fragile when I first handled it, all though that may simply be due to the paranoia caused by reading reviews on here. It took a very short amount of time for me to get used to carrying it around. The volume boosting of this amp is also quite impressive to me. I've never had an amp before, but this allows me to blast songs on my laptop which were normally pretty low. Haven't messed around with the different audio presets much, but I honestly see no reason to do so. I will likely update this review as things come up, such as how long it takes the E6 to die on me. The volume control is precise, but allows a press and hold feature for a more quick adjustment, which is neat.<br /><br />In reply to other reviews, the E6 does not power on when it's charging. It lights up to let you know it's charging, and then the light shuts off when it's done. I plugged headphones into it when it was charging and didn't get sound out of it until I powered it on, like normal. Sometimes the E6 picks up interference, but it isn't especially bothersome. It's more a minor inconvenience, and other than that, I have yet to pay attention to how long I've used it in order to give a valid estimation of its battery life.<br /><br />Like others have mentioned, there is no battery indicator, nor does the on-light change to signify low battery. Often times, the thing will shut off in the middle of an activity, and you'll have to plug in the charger cable. It's really inconvenient if you're not using the thing on a computer at the time. Whatever you were doing is put on halt until the amp is either fully charged or has enough battery to finish up whatever you were doing. Also, the volume resets to default when the battery runs out of juice, so you have to readjust it to the optimal level. This is annoying enough for me to throw the thing on the charger before that happens, just so I don't have to finely tune the volume all over again. You'll want to do this regardless since discharging Lithium Ion batteries completely before recharging them will shorten their life. Using the amp while simultaneously charging it also nets you more interference than when it's not charging, and you get no indication of when it's done while doing so. You have to stop and turn off the amp so you can see if the red charging light shuts off or not. Rinse and repeat until it's done charging.<br /><br />It may sound like I dislike or even hate the product after that last paragraph, but I'm just being thorough. On a side note, the delivery was handled well. Less than three days after it shipped out, I already had the package in my hands (and I chose the free super saver shipping). I love the product, so it earns a full five stars. Though, as long as it was easy to use and amplified volume without distorting it, it would have earned full marks regardless. Obviously, if the thing breaks on me quickly, I'll revise my score, but I'll try not to let the negative reviews affect me. If you have devices that need a sound boost, or have the same TV situation as me, I fully recommend this product.<br /><br />I don't know if the battery life has diminished over the course of the five months I've had it, but it's lasting me under five hours at max volume after a full charge.you're not using the thing on a computer at the time.

B005S9EJ46|5.0|You won't be disappointed --- with these actors and a great story line --- beautifully filmed.  Hope the price comes down on blu-ray
0345803507|1.0|I finally finished the last book in the trilogy.  On the one hand I'm glad I read it since I like being in-the-know as far as what others are talking about but oh how painful it was to read this drivel.  I could hardly wait to get done and I was hoping against hope that Ana would grow a pair and dump his ass.  Could she be any more stupid?  Christian Grey is a class act jerk.  Over and over again he'd treat her horribly (sometimes just when I'd start to think maybe he wasn't so bad after all).  She'd get suitably and appropriately angry about it and then -- oh, he'd touch her or look at her in 'that way' or he'd speak in a low, throaty growl -- and she'd be 'lost'.  UGH.  The writing is terrible, too many repetitive phrases, the sex (while scintillating at times!) gets really old after reading it on page after page after page.  A few loose ends, characters not tightly written, NO plot whatsoever in the first book, an unrealistic romantic timeline and -- again, this is not a minor critique -- too many phrases, terms and descriptions used again and again and AGAIN.  Nauseating.  Money and time poorly spent...

B000J103PC|5.0|Pound for pound, no one lays on the vicious snark like a woman targeting another woman. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant's assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.<br /><br />Andy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won't change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.<br /><br />Meryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film's dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee's self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she's in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly's frazzled first assistant - and Andy's primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview. No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.<br /><br />Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don't hate her. You're not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly's incessant, impossible demands. It's not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend's patience is wearing thin.<br /><br />This film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen. I laughed at the right bits and scornfully rolled my eyes at the sheer fanaticism these frantic characters invested in mere articles of clothing. I then went to sleep in my awesome grown-up Underoos.No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.<br /><br />Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway.

B000FBJAOG|5.0|I loved this book. it is amazing how he composed the book  on what wepons you need,  what wepons you dont need, and how zombies behave
0767834739|2.0|The first Resident Evil surpassed my expectations and is actually an entertaining little zombie flick that I am proud to have in my zombie movie collection. Apocalypse started out awesome and then completely fell apart like 20 minutes in. This movie is just all over the place. When making a zombie movie, please stick to the zombies. We dont need to see the main character fist fight a cyborg/human/alien that carries a grenade launcher. Just shoot it in the head. The whole plot was just ridiculous. Im not even gonna try to explain it to you. This movie could have been great, they had such good material to work with. I cant believe they let it devolve into this mess.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|Mark Wahlberg - exciting, twisty, violent, unpredictable. I watched it four times in two days and enjoyed it every time. I now will watch anything MW is ever in. Mark Wahlberg.
B005HWUBZ0|1.0|I based my purchase on a new report on this guy.  The clip showed his music as upbeat.  I didn't find that when listening.  And when he sings falsetto, it's a real turn off.
B007FOH7UU|4.0|I'm a sucker for Keane's brand of British Pop; anthemic songs with high soaring melodies and emotional impact. The kind of music Coldplay knocks off in their sleep and Snow Patrol can mount on a good album. \\"Strangeland\\" is a return to form in that regard. The synth-pop of \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" and the experiments of \\"Night Train\\" are gone, replaced with a back to basics approach to composer Tim Rice Oxley's emotional approach and the soaring vocals of Tim Chaplin. There's a lot of calls to the 'wide eyed dreamers' (in \\"Sovereign Light Caf&eacute;\\") or 'we're gonna rise again' on the ecstatic first single, \\"Silenced By The Night.\\"<br /><br />Pianos plink in the background and there's pipes and flutes, like you can just tell Keane was aiming for the big emotional statement. While this was done perfectly on the album \\"Under The Iron Sea,\\" on \\"Strangeland,\\" the band has matured into craftsmen. The lyrics are unforced, but also lack depth. A lesser band would have a calamity in this situation, but Keane have become sharp enough to overcome the occasional triteness by having enough of a sense of space and nuance (both \\"Neon River\\" and the excellant \\"Sea Fog,\\" the discs elegiac closer). There;s also an earnestness to Chaplin's singing that assists in outshining the odd weaknesses.<br /><br />\\"Strangeland\\" is not Keane's finest hour, but it is a return to what makes the unique in their world of pop. \\"Sometimes our fingers graze the sky\\" he cheers on \\"Day Will Come.\\" With sweet and oft-catchy songs that recall Coldplay and U2, Keane are happy with grasping for the stars, and \\"Strangeland\\" will satisfy fans of \\"Under The Iron Sea\\" or \\"Hopes and Dreams.\\"
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game. You get to see 1-2 minute movies of the new movie of The Ice Age. You can buy animals and complete a family by finding their mate and their children. The game money is surprising easy to get. I am really addicted to this game.
B004NJW96M|4.0|the cardboard sleeve was crushed on one corner and removes da value in this collector's item. I would have liked to receive this item in very good condition as specified in my purchase on Amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|fast fun and addicting,  it never gets old. its an easy way to pass an empty afternoon. great great great game!
B004YTGRMI|3.0|First off, this is a very nice package.  The bonus content and extra printed goodies are fun.  The story of this album can't be understated.  It's a watershed moment in alt-rock.  It's REM's \\"Revolver\\".  For its fan's, the music is a timestamp for a place in their lives (for me it was my college days).<br /><br />Everything's very sumptuous until you get to the original album disc.  It's ear-splittingly EQ'd/mastered, and not in a good way.  Now, it has been said, the original LP was not the most dynamic recording in history.  But the original vinyl cut from Bob Ludwig still stands as the best way to hear this classic.  I can't help but wonder if the band endorsed this version because its excessively loud and lacks any warmth present in the original LP.  In fact, the previous IRS edition bests this version by a rather wide margin.<br /><br />BUT --- the bonus \\"Athens Demos\\" is a monument in its own right.  So therein lays the quandary.  Do you buy this for the swag and the 2nd CD knowing that the original rehashed will disappoint?  The answer resides in just how important this music is for you.  For me, that 2nd disc completes the story.  So, if you have the IRS reissue, that CD will supplement this set in the proper way, but only if you can buy this box for $10, as I did.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|too much sex and not enough story. Everytime I thought that something was going to give the book some substance it was back to another sex scene.
