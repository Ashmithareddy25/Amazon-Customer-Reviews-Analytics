B002VQ7PVS|5.0|Restless is one of the best spy books I have ever read. The story is told in chapters alternating between England in the 1970's and WWII. The main characters in the 1970's are a young woman and her middle-aged mother. The WWII passages are about the mother, who was a spy. There is a traitor, too. The plot is realistic and the characters quite believable.<br /><br />Anyone liking this book will also like Daniel Silva's The Unlikely Spy, which is also a spy story set in WWII England, and much more realistic than Silva's Gabriel Allon series.

B004LROUNG|5.0|The Litigators is not a legal thriller, in which a heroic attorney defeats a villain. It's a satire on greedy, unprincipled attorneys who pursue mass lawsuits against manufacturers just to become rich.  There are also some swipes at big law firms and sleazy ambulance chasers. There is an idealistic young attorney and he even slugs someone, but he loses his main case.<br /><br />It's an excellent book, but don't expect a pulse pounding thriller. It's really entertaining and has some funny moments.

B00386EZJU|5.0|When seeing the movie, I noticed a bit of music that I thought might work for a film trailer I was making.  I wasn't sure which cut it was so I just downloaded the whole thing since the rest of the music sounded pretty good too.  Pretty good????  Boy did I underestimate this soundtrack!  This is the most amazing soundtrack I've heard in years!  It's definitely in my top soundtracks of all time. If you're still reading all of the amazing reviews for it and wondering how the score to a cartoon dragon movie can be so wonderful... what are you waiting for?  Go buy it!  I can guarantee you won't be disappointed.  I also agree with the \\"youngun\\" who said not to listen to it before bedtime.  You will NOT be able to sleep.  It's great to listen to if you run though, VERY motivating.

But as far as the song material goes, I was disappointed that there wasn't more in the CDs that wasn't already part of the bootlegs that's been collected over the last 30-40 years.

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I went in to the theater and saw the movie, and much to my surprise, it was EXACTLY like the first movie. It had small groups of special characters, it had the kind of plot which centers around a young and \\"different\\" member of the species, and in the end, everything sorts out. Not worth it, if you've seen the first one, you have seen this one, and even if you have REMOTELY seen the trailer to Happy Feet 2, you pretty much have seen what this movie offers. There aren't any more funny scenes, than the ones in the trailer, aren't any more characters or anything. Really Dull movie.

B005MYEPXC|3.0|If ever there was a DVD which called for commentary and extra documentaries, a movie involving major writers of the 1920s certainly would.

B004EPZ08O|3.0|Rivals SAW for the sickest, most gruesome, highly improbable routes to death. The CGI, props and other effects achieved their desired results - not fun to watch and definitely not for anyone under 14. The raison d'etre for the movie is that it doesn't pretend to be anything other than over-the-top, disgustingly gruesome. NO happy endings here; no romantic sendoffs; no cute little critters. If there is ever a case for instinctual biological fears this movie certainly adds to that case.  Cinematography, CGI, settings and props, directing all effectively and efficiently staged. Acting, however, was just too acting like - not that that's a prerequisite for this movie.

0756404738|4.0|What images do the words \\"epic fantasy\\" bring to your mind? For me, they call up ferocious battles and distant lands and great, world-changing actions. By those measures, Patrick Rothfuss' The Wise Man's Fear would certainly fall into the epic-fantasy camp. Yet those approaching the second volume in The Kingkiller Chronicle with hopes of Tolkien-esque fields of slaughter or the geographic sweep of the Viriconium novels will probably end up a bit surprised. Rothfuss maintains the approach he began with The Name of the Wind, twisting fantasy tropes to fit an intimate rather than expansive narrative, a story centered on a single, extraordinary life.  The Chronicler is ready to pick up his pen again. A day and a night have passed, and the story he has heard so far from the legendary Kvothe hasn't disappointed. A tragic childhood. A serendipitous enrollment at a famous arcane academy. A clever dispatching of a marauding dragon. A search for the terrifying Chandrian, at whose appearance iron rusts and wood rots and flames gutter blue. The red-haired man masquerading as a backwater innkeeper has recounted many of the details for which the Chronicler has longed. Yet there are more to come. As the second day dawns, he will learn how Kvothe saved the life of a powerful noble, turned the tide of a savage skirmish, and escaped the clutches of the seductive Felurian, the fae woman whose charms break men's bodies and crush their minds. But doubts will arise in the Chronicler's mind, too. Why do some of the tales that Kvothe recounts not seem to square with evidence? Why can't the man who allegedly called lightning down on scores of his enemies deal with a couple of squabbling soldiers? And why does Kvothe's fae assistant, Bast, seem so set on having the Chronicler produce an uplifting account of his master?  If you've read The Name of the Wind, you have a pretty good idea of what lies in store with The Wise Man's Fear. If not, then go get it -- now. Any author deserves attentionwho can produce an 800-page-plus tome that's elegantly written, original in setting, exciting in action, profound in theme and imminently readable throughout. That's no small feat. His follow-up keeps the quality similarly high, albeit with a few missteps. Readers know from the first book that Kvothe is destined to become a great lover, a kind of brainy warrior Cassanova. But when Rothfuss introduces Kvothe's first liaison with the supernatural Felurian , it comes across as more silly than seductive, purple in style and studded with similes galore. \\"Though I am doused in you, I burn,\\" he intones. \\"The motion of your turning head is like a song. Is like a spark. Is like a breath that billows me and fans to flame a fire that cannot help but spread and roar your name.\\" You get the idea. Also, the novel tends to lose its main plot thread among a snarl of secondary actions, and when references to the Chandrian pop up, they do so with surprising abruptness. Still, these are pretty minor faults. Anyone who liked The Name of the Wind would be foolish to not pick up The Wise Man's Fear.
0385738773|5.0|i love love loved it it was so good the whole trilogy was amazing. if you haven't read them you most defiantly should! in some ways it reminded me of lost, a TV show, the fact that there were so many questions but i was quite satisfied that they all got answered.
0812550706|4.0|Sometimes it becomes nigh impossible to give a book an unbiased read. Take Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game. Though I had scant exposure to Card's prose before picking up the novel, I knew that he was considered a master in the field, that Ender had won a Hugo and a Nebula, and that the director of the Oscar-winning South African film Tsotsi was directing a big-screen adaptation. With such praise littering my RSS feeds, I found it difficult to approach Ender's Game with the requisite blank slate that a good critic ought to have. Opening to the first chapter, I found myself hoping for narrative greatness -- and fearing my lofty expectations would let me down.  Earth's inhabitants call the menacing alien race the buggers. The insectoid marauders have another name, sure, but two hard-fought wars made the crass moniker stick. Humanity has nursed a grudge ever since utter disaster was averted in the second conflict through the daring of Admiral Mazer Rackham. But the buggers are still out there, and a military genius like Rackham only comes along once a generation, if at all. Humanity can't hope to stumble on a savior the third time their fleets come calling. So the rulers of Earth's tenuous alliance government hatch a plan to find the sharpest young mind possible and imbue it with tactical brilliance. No danger or depredation could prove excessive if it resulted in another Rackham. After all, the human race is on the line. Eventually, the authorities find their subject, one Ender Wiggin, a youth who's all of six years old.  I'm tempted to say that Ender's Game didn't live up to my expectations, but that sounds too negative. Card's debut novel doesn't disappoint; it's too well-written for that. Where lesser writers would have turned the book's child geniuses into flat ciphers, Card makes them well-rounded, engaging people in their own right. The plot keeps the pages turning, even if the twist ending doesn't exactly surprise. And the themes Card addresses have plenty of profundity. In fact, those very themes made me think twice about the novel. For a title that's supposed to be a crowd pleaser, it sure does focus on cruelty. Ender suffers through agony after agony, from a sociopathic, animal-torturing sibling who threatens to murder him to thrashings from intellectually inferior peers to a military bureaucracy that intentionally lets such things happen in order to hone their star pupil's strategic mindset. Card places readers in the uncomfortable position of simultaneously acknowledging the horror in such crimes and seeing how they eventually make Ender into Rackham's equal. Other ethical dilemmas unfold, too, such as the rightness of seeking to utterly annihilate an implacable foe or whether it's justifiable for politicos to manipulate the populace in order to achieve peace. Weighty stuff, and it makes for an intense Game indeed.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|This film starts off as  a kids film that  makes it  suitable for the pre-teens only. The  mood changes and we then have  a drunk and two  junkies smoking  illegal substances. For Spielberg,why  did you  have to  have junkies in the film as it detracts from  the film's intended audience? Definately not for  pre-teens due to the substance abuse in the film (several times). The storyline  is basically a rehash of the classic E.T. but without  the emotional impact that E.T.had. You know the ending as it is very predictable all the way. In the finale you just  yawn and  say 'who cares' to yourself.Very disappointing.
B00003ZA27|3.0|Karajan made a number of recordings throughout his long career that were ill-starred. While the genesis of the zodiac is unknown in each instance, their malevolence is not. To wit, the Piano Concerto marathon with Gieseking; the EMI Lohengrin (or so we are roundly told), the Flying Dutchmen; some would say his Tristan (on account of the odd balances and the inability of Dernesch to shake off a malady); and to their number one could add this Mass in B Minor.<br /><br />When Karajan relocated kitchens from the Jesus Christus Church to the Philharmonie at the beginning of 1973, he did so in the face of criticism. Jochum had anathematised the latter as a recording venue. In response, management fitted a new wooden floor which mitigated the deadness somewhat. In any event, it did not bode well for this particular enterprise.<br /><br />Behold the Soup! It does not come any claggier than this. The Mass is homogenised and over pungent from the first note to the last. Karajan is lacking in touch throughout - evidenced in his inability to temper the Berlin Philharmonic (the opening of the Gloria and the Et Resurrexit sound like Bruckner). The singers - an estimable quintet - do their best to add some granularity to the gruel until the next ritornello comes along and drenches them in legato. Janowitz in particular can only do so much to save the day. The Original Image Bit Processing has added water to the soup, making it less opaque; in doing so, it shifts more of the blame onto the conductor.<br /><br />Take his fine EMI recording, put it in a microwave for a minute or so and you'll have an approximation of this travesty. As DV_F mentions, Karajan himself knew this was an abject failure; it should have been binned. DG said: publish it and be damned - with crotons.<br /><br />That leaves our raucous friend in the corner with the black feathers. He's cool. Once the soup kitchen cranks up in the Kyrie, he croaks for his tithe; it is duly forthcoming. Don't feed him anymore!<br /><br />The Soup-Raven croaks - and He croaks for Herbie!/><br />The Soup-Raven croaks - and He croaks for Herbie!

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|The Black Sox Scandal. Ponzi Schemes. Prohibition and the Volstead Act. Gangsters getting rich selling alcohol while the government flounders and politicians lie, cheat and steal to ensure that the alcohol keeps flowing.  Is this series a version of the Sopranos for the 1920s? In some ways, maybe it is, but in other ways it holds its own. Steve Buscemi plays Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson who is the County Treasurer for Atlantic City, but he also controls the alcohol flow in and out of the city and controls politicians from the lowest alderman to the highest judges and senators in the land.  The show is just outstanding in every way. From the plot(s), the characters, the acting, the dialogue and the setting. It is very obvious that some serious research went into each episode with true life characters and events tangled into the midst of various plots each week. The roaring 1920s and the speculative economy (much like ours today as we live on the edge of credit and financial ruin) are played out beautifully in this series. The Internal Revenue Agents who desperately try to tie Nucky Thompson to the illegal distribution of alcohol to the average worker on the Boardwalk trying to survive are all tangled in a great series and I cannot wait until I watch Season 2 of this fantastic show.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder is possibly the best retelling of a fairy tale that I have ever read. It's so good that once I was submerged in the book, I had all but forgotten that I was reading about Cinderella. And I was skeptical. Cyborgs are NOT my thing. People from the moon? No thanks. Princes falling in love with commoners? Unless you're Kate Middleton? It doesn't happen. I wasn't sure it could feel real, but oh was I wrong. Almost immediately after stating, I was sucked in and couldn't stop reading or thinking about this book.<br /><br />Sure, by the 130's I thought I had a major plot point figured out. By 170's I was sure. But this story is about so much more than the big moment. It really is about the journey. It's about the vivid city of New Beijing. It's abut the plague (and I love me some plague action!) it's about Cinder and her witch of a guardian. It's about the dreamy Prince Kai. And old cars.<br /><br />Marissa Meyers characters are fantastic. You can't help but love Cnder - she is truly amazing. Her sister Peony and her android Iko are also lovable in the little sister and best friend way. Even Adri (the evil step mother) and Pearl (the evil sister) are characters you love to hate. Don't even start me on the doctor, or Queen Levana! Oh how I hated her.<br /><br />And the ending? Well, it's not an ending at all. Rather a device to make you go absolutely insane while waiting on the next installment of this fabulous series.<br /><br />So go, grab Cinder. Clear your weekend plans. You won't be able to do anything else once you've started reading this book.

B000001ESF|4.0|\\"And the meek (Rush fans?) shall inherit the earth\\" this 2/1/12 - Rush Day!  Well, probably not, but it does give occasion to review this classic progressive rock/heavy metal milestone.  I do not have a whole lot to add (by my standards) to the 300+ reviews already here, but suffice to say that my experience with Rush is that this band probably has the most devoted fan base I have ever seen.  I recall being asked by a friend years ago \\"which album do you want to hear?\\" but to my astonishment/horror he actually meant which Rush album did I want to hear.  Needless to say, 2112 was one of the albums featured prominently in his collection, and I will (try to) briefly recount my feelings about it today.  2112 was indeed a landmark of sorts both for Rush (a do or die effort for the band lest they be dropped from their record label) and for the progressive rock movement in general, which was about to get hit hard by punk circa '76/'77 (things had gotten a bit bloated in the music industry overall so I tend to agree with punk enthusiasts that this kick in the pants was necessary), and is still looked down on along with heavy metal by the rock establishment to this day.  I've gotta hand it to Rush for sticking to their guns in making a non-commercial record such as this, a move almost as gutsy as George Lucas making \\"Star Wars\\" around that same time.  It is not too hard to interpret what was originally Side 1 of 2112 as a prescient allegory on the state of rock and roll both then and now.  Who says rock and roll must lyrically be about cars, sex, drugs, etc. (\\"the words you read\\")?  Who says rock and roll must conform to 3 minute song-lengths (\\"the songs you sing\\")?  Who says rock and roll artists must look and act a certain way (\\"the pictures that give pleasure to your eyes\\")?  Well, the media-controlling Priests of the \\"Temples of Syrinx\\" (Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame, anyone?) that's who, according to Rush, in the sci-fi epic title track's thinly veiled attack on censorshipset in the dystopian year of 2112. Over the course of seven movements (almost but not quite 21:12 in length), the story follows the protagonist's \\"discovery\\" of a guitar from the elder race, which is rejected in a \\"presentation\\" to the non-change favoring priests who like things just as average as they are.  It ends tragically as our hero apparently dies by his own hand after dreaming about the ancients, who are ostensibly those of us living today, and serves as a cautionary tale in the vein of Orwell's \\"1984,\\" or perhaps more directly Ayn Rand's \\"Anthem.\\"  The songs on the original Side 2 may be \\"throwaways\\" indirectly related to the main theme, but they are all played with such going-for-broke abandonment, not to mention the usual stellar musicianship fans have come to expect from Rush, that it is hard not to get caught up in the band's enthusiasm.  An engaging naivete, if you will, especially impressive for a 3-piece rock band.  While I rarely, if ever, give any album 5-stars, and would probably rate 2112 at 3 1/2 stars as a general album, I have decided to round up to 4 rather than down based on how much I have enjoyed revisiting it.  As a Rush album, 2112 perhaps deserves 5-stars though, given its importance in the band's formidable catalog, ranking highly along with Moving Pictures.  So, if you are a newbie to Rush, then this album might serve both as a gateway to the band, and to progressive rock/heavy metal in general.  Enjoy!

B005DOL0R0|5.0|I ordered this (in graphite) because I did not want a bulky case, just a protective sleeve that would not add to the  size and that would protect my Fire when not in use.  This is just perfect.  It has adequate protection - perhaps not IF  you are contemplating dropping it off of a second story roof, but for everyday use it should be great.  It is a close fit, but that is in order to protect the Fire.  I have a small stylus that came with the screen protective sheet and it will fit  in the sleeve in the 'fold' area opposite of the zipper side.  I think that some disappointments are due to the fact that  people weren't sure what they wanted...  Based on my regular Kindle and my husband's tablet, that have larger and bulkier  covers...I knew what I did not want.  This was perfect to meet my goal.

B005ZKYXZI|4.0|\\"We all wanted to make the kind of movie that we loved when we were young, the kind fo get-out-of-your-seat, cheer-for-the-underdog kind of movie that was going to be visually cool, but would be tonally different than you expect a robot movie to be -- a tone that may be closer to WALL-E or Iron Giant than it is to Transformers or Terminator.\\"<br /><br />Real Steel director Shawn Levy says this on the audio commentary (THANK YOU!) on both the Blu-ray and DVD of the movie, which had a big opening weekend in theaters and also on home video sales and rentals.<br /><br />Indeed, Real Steel is very much like Iron Giant in spirit, and also like a very high tech Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. It's also an update of films like The Champ, in which a child helps a former achiever to reach again for the top, as a success and as a person.<br /><br />As Levy also remarks in the commentary, the choice of likable star Hugh Jackman for a role that is unlikable for a good portion of the film is a major reason for how well it succeeds. Perhaps by design, Jackman never really comes across as a believable jerk, though he is very earnest and real in the role (despite his occasional tangles between his Australian accent with a \\"street tough\\" American dialect). He's ably supported by Dakota Goyo as his estranged young son (a performance that could make or break the film, but it this case \\"makes\\" it) and Evangeline Lilly, whose relatively small role radiates immense charm and appeal.<br /><br />The robots and the spectacular effects are stars, of course, in this type of film, but Levy is careful to keep the real and the steel in balance. Visually, the filmmakers achieved what he calls a \\"retro modern\\" look in that takes place a few fictitious years from now. In order to make the robots more relatable to the actors, a combination of CG and full-size robots were created.<br /><br />Levy also makes great use of the Michigan locations -- very stark and Blade Runner-ish without augmentation, thanks to the highly industrial look of gigantic assembly plants and scrapyards. In an early fight sequence, hundreds of extras are seen throughout a sprawling structure that was not a special comp effect, but a real place where large automobile parts where shipped in by train.<br /><br />Real Steel isn't designed to be confused with The Artist. It's a popcorn cruncher that succeeds on its own terms.o the highly industrial look of gigantic assembly plants and scrapyards.

0307593312|2.0|Please don't buy this, it will only encourage more of the same.  I don't think this is really a finished novel. It appears to be a first draft 500 pages too long. And, even if you did cut those 500 pages, it would still need some reworking.  There is a story buried in here. There's clearly the beginnings of a narrative about child sexual abuse causing a fragmented personality/world. Throw in the crazy little people, the cult, the female assassin...you might just have something. Too bad it had to be stretched into three volumes.  I really am not trying to be cute here. This seems to have been put out purely to make money. It doesn't seem literary.  Everything Murakami's written to date is far better than this, and there probably is a very interesting story explaining just why and how this ever got puked out into the world.
B005URRCUY|4.0|As The Black Keys have steadily ascended to the garage stomp throne since vacated by The White Stripes, the best thing about their climb has been the increasing coolness of their albums. \\"Brothers\\" pulled everything into a tight, thudding packages, and with \\"El Camino,\\" the duo - again with the help of Danger Mouse - bring everything down to a basic fuzz-guitar pounding. At the same time, everything is in its perfect place, from the raging buzz-saw solos (\\"Gold On The Ceiling\\") to the Hives-y raunch of \\"Stop Stop,\\" this is an album that refines itself to the core.<br /><br />It also means those who loved the disjointed and unfocused loopiness that the early albums contained will be crying Sell-Out all over the place. The simple truth is, The Black Keys have learned their craft down the a level of cool that most bands never reach. They even know and wink at it; search for the Colbert Report Sell-Out Sell-Off between The Black Keys and vampire Weekend and you'll see what Patrick Carney and Dan Auerbach think of their commercial success. It's only rock and roll, and they're going to have a good time with it. \\"She wants milk and honey/She wants filthy money\\" cries Auerbach in \\"Money Maker.\\" It's still all about cars and girls. And volume. And for now, The Black Keys' \\"El Camino\\" is the best place to find it.

Ronnie James Dio had given new life to Black Sabbath, AC/DC was riding high with \\"For Those About To Rock\\" and even the Scorpions were breaking with their classic \\"Blackout.\\" Priest had already come off a couple of highly acclaimed albums, \\"Hellbent For Leather,\\" \\"British Steel\\" and \\"Point of Entry.\\" 1982 was their time.<br /><br />\\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" delivered. \\"The Hellion/Electric Eye\\" swooped down like the metallic falcon of the LP's cover and cast Rob Halford as the world's overseer. The title track unleashed the twin guitars if Glen Tipton and KK Downing while Halford let loose with operatic wails above the roar. Most importantly, \\"You've Got Another This Coming\\" gave the band a rare chart single, and became an anthem for sports arenas across the globe. The album itself peaked at 17 on Billboard, a high-water mark only eclipsed by \\"Angel of Retribution\\" and \\"Nostradamus\\" over 20 years later.<br /><br />As iconic heavy metal albums go, \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" is comparable to \\"Back In Black\\" or \\"Heaven and Hell\\" from the same period. While I'd personally put \\"British Steel\\" above this as my favorite Judas Priest album, punch for punch, \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" is among the band's most fully consistent.
B005LAIGFU|1.0|This is a film in the \\"monster baby\\" genre. These films typically provide a means by which people can express politically incorrect attitudes toward children and parenthood in a situation contrived to allow it. The film stacks the deck about as far as it can by making the child (Kevin) an irredeemable monster on a path toward monsterhood from birth. The greater his monsterhood, the greater the contrived excessess of his mother the film can wallow in.  The fatal problem of the film is that it mixes a whole kitchen sink of general psychological baggage about parenting up with the problems of having been the parent of a child who has committed a horrible act. Doing either one of these subjects in isolation would have been good. Doing them both together is not so good. And not so good in particular because the one (his being a monster) allows the other (the psychological aspect) to go off without any bounds at all. Of course ultimately horror makes money and serious films dont.  The film is also full of rather heavy handed symbolism. Subtile it is not. Red. Red. Red. Red....  The film is about as nihilist as them come. Guilt and shame in fatal doses covers everything. No shades of grey anywhere. There is also more than a bit of rather mindless man-hatred lurking in the background. Its difficult to know how to look at some of this. Are her memories a real view of what happened or are they the product of revisionism based on guilt?  In the end, its all so emotionally overheated and manipulative that its difficult to take anything serious away from it. It seems mostly an excuse to drown the viewer in negative emotions for a couple hours.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I began reading this book three days ago and finished it today.  It is an excellent book, well-written and engaging.  I hung on every word and i think that the true mark of a good book is that feeling when you say \\"I'm going to read until 6pm\\" then comes 7 and you're still reading until finally its 10PM and you're wondering where the last 4 hours went.  The Hunger Games was that book for me, easily the most enjoyable book i have read in a while.  However, that doesn't mean it is without flaw.  In my eyes, the only true problem with this book was the ending.  I understand it is a lead-in to a whole new book (Catching-Fire) but i feel that the ending to the Games themselves was a bit confusing, and therefore a bit anti-climatic.  I had to read it twice to know what was really going on and it just seemed to me that it could have been done better a different way.  But, I am a fan of the \\"Final Showdown\\" so when I was robbed of it in this instance, it turned me off a little bit.  Hopefully, you know what i am talking about if you have read it.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't.  Overall though, I am intrigued by the book and will be purchasing the 2nd book soon.  As soon as i get my vision back from reading this one lol.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|I bought this app and didn't really like it its not worth the money (to ME). All you do is draw and its not worth it.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|season two was better. i received the dvd in what it seemed no time, it played wonderful and case was immaculate.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|The Kindle Fire is reasonably rugged, and the screen is well made. However, this and the other covers available at a reasonable cost from Amazon.com are recommended to provide additional protection protection for the Kindle Fire.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|season one is great! i received the dvd in what it seemed no time. it played wonderful and case was immaculate.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Nice app. Moveable to SD card. Would be even better if there were a way to save as wallpaper or live wallpaper (like the app Fractoid) .
B006E4QCXU|1.0|Keeps saying install.  Sends message saying it is already installed, but when I click on it, it says to install...again.
B001E18C68|5.0|This is a great concert DVD. I know that WT has an orchestra in all their CD's, but still this is an awesome DVD. The 5.1 Dolby sound just enhances the experience. If you like Within Temptation or any other kind of symphonic metal, then this is a perfect DVD for you.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Bought this just because it looked cool but now my office mates keep borrowing it during long winded meetings. Would not let the person use it when they were going to the restroom.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Quick Read...I wish it lasted longer though. There were some grammatical errors but the story was fantastic. This book was an emotional roller coaster that I couldn't put down. Excellent.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|fantastic visuals that will get old after a min or two, not worth asking price. should be free. I'd give it 3 stars if it was free but 2 dollars? ayfkm. no way.
145162445X|1.0|I am a biologist, and I have eagerly waited for this book to come out because I am very curious about the subject. I got it, read it and was disappointed... Unfortunately I could not understand it. The author makes many references to equations you never see, describe forces and particles without adequate illustrations, and the reader never really knows if the approach is chronological or just whimsical (I was not able to perceive the structure of the book; despite the obvious title, not even the nature of the problem is well stated.) Examples of subjects the author makes you think he is explaining but in fact isn't are: how some physicists weighted the universe; how relativity and quantum physics relate; why there HAS to be a positron for an electron, and, of course, how the universe originated from nothing, since I could not understand all the intermediate steps. It is embarrassing to admit such a failure to understand a book supposedly written for lay people.. maybe I AM dumb, or maybe physics cannot be taught without the mathematics. Or maybe the problem lies with the author. I have read a Kindle book by Robert Amneus called \\"The origin of the universe - case closed\\" and despite several equations, I was able to understand it. The book is logical and the author do not try to be funny.
B005FLX1HS|3.0|I bought the album first on beatport.com when it came out, thought it was alright. When i first heard \\"right in\\" i said \\"wow, i barely even consider this music\\" and i listen to alot of EDM/glitch/other weird stuff. As i listened to it more it kinda grew on me but i wish he had added more substance to this EP. I really do like summit for some weird reason it reminds me alot of with you, friends from his last album. Anyways, buy it if you want to stay up to date with the music scene but its not that incredible.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I wanted to base this review purely off what you get in this boxed set. To start I am in my forties and have been a fan of the franchise since the beginning, I am not a purist snob, but I do have an affection for these films beyond the celluloid they are printed on.<br /><br />First, the box. I have no idea why companies keep making non-standard boxes. They think I want a collector's item, but what I really want is something that looks uniform with the rest of my collection. The inside box is tight and it is hard to get in and out of - plus the \\"sleeves\\" make it impossible to remove discs without getting fingerprints on them.<br /><br />Second the artwork on the box is all original and new for this release. One question... why? With so much vintage art available from the archives - why on earth commission new pieces? Lucas seems to think the fans want \\"new\\" stuff, but the reality is - we want the old stuff! In addition this \\"new\\" artwork - is horrible. Some of it looks like it was done by High School students for a county faire.<br /><br />Third - bonus disks. Even though there is enough material in the archives to make a boxed set for each movie (like Lord of the Rings did) Lucas has put the special features for 3 films together on one disk. Each movie is broken down into \\"planets\\" but the features are not always directly related to the planets - it's all very haphazard.<br /><br />A typical special feature disk would include interviews with the costume designers, set designers, script writers, location scouts, the director and actors. Surprisingly, those features are sparse to non-existent. The vast majority of interviews and features are about the model builders and special effects team members. For episodes 4-6 the features are almost 90% the same 4 model builders. Again, with so many vintage interviews and archives - why give us new material?<br /><br />The third special feature disk are Star Wars vignettes not even put together by Lucas - most of these are independent or have been on television already. From all of my past Star Wars discs, I have a slew of shows that COULD have been included - but were not - not to mention the hard to find Holiday Episode.<br /><br />The movies themselves are gorgeous! I have a high def player, showing 1080p and I have no idea why so many reviewers say that these prints look bad. Admittedly there are some scenes which look darker than others, and there are fractions of moments that look grainy, but I have several copies of these films (including the lazer disk burns) and these are by and far the best.<br /><br />As a star wars fan, I own them, I have to. Do I wish they were better? Of course, but perhaps as a fan boy, nothing will ever live up to my expectations.all of my past Star Wars discs, I have a slew of shows that COULD have been included - but were not - not to mention the hard to find Holiday Episode.

B0043RSJ8G|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it sure helped me hone what I believe about how hurtful the church can be today and where it needs work. It is too bad that the Snowflake adoption was caught up in the court mess, because it is such a wonderful organization. Love one another, and remember that people remember how you make them feel above all else.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|the gravity simulation in this program is absolutely beautiful and is quite entertaining. the program works wonderfully on my motorola photon, my 1 criticism would be that's the program does not to feature exceleration for the nvidia tegra accelerator chipset. or at least it appears not to. I would like to see orbital simulations possible, such as being able to place a larger particles to simulate plants orbiting your finger as the sun or in simulateing something like the milkyways rotation or that of a solar system. I would also like to see the particles having inertia, as the should... not just stopping when you lift your finger so that multiple gravitational interactions could be established. particles should also change color based on the amount of velocity they have or perhaps how intensely they're being attracted by the gravitational mass. being able to use more than 2 fingers on the screen to give gravitational centerpoints would also be nice.
0439023521|5.0|This book had me at: \\"When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold.\\" This is a book I had meant to savor and read a bit each night, but the absolute phenomenal writing of Suzanne Collins would not allow me to do so. I read it in a day. On my birthday. My husband gave it to me as a gift before he left for work. Reading here and there, in between my celebrating, it was done with-in an hour of going to bed.<br />I love the strong female character that is Katniss. I love the uncertainty she has, the strength she displays, and her beauty of which she is unaware.<br /><br />The book takes place in post-apocalyptic America.  The new country is divided into twelve districts with a capitol that lies somewhere in the Rockies. There was a 13th district but it was obliterated by the capitol in a show of force and a squashing of a rebellion. In order to keep a tight reign on the people of the twelve districts, the capitol keeps them hungry and afraid; by watching, listening, and rewarding informants. They also have a \\"game\\" (called \\"the Hunger Games\\") every year in which two children from each district must participate. It is a last man standing version of our \\"Survivor\\", minus the fancy rewards and immunity idols. Katniss is chosen to participate and we follow her in this game throughout the book.<br /><br />I was struck afterwards thinking about our own reality shows and how far are we, really, from having a reality show like The Hunger Games? How far are we from allowing the government to monitor our every move, purchase, and thought? Our government already has a hand in our food supply allowing it to be genetically modified and adding chemicals to supposedly make it safer when all they really do is cause problems and side effects. Ok- enough of the soap box.<br /><br />Read the book. Read the book especially if you are a fan of \\"The Walking Dead\\" television series, \\"The Road\\" [[ASIN:0307387895 The Road (Oprah's Book Club)]] a book by  Cormac McCarthy, and if you like \\"Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies\\".

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that there are so different versions to choose from!  And it'd very easy to navigate to the different books, chapters, and verses.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love the interface and the fact that I can use it on my Fire, my Droid, and my Windows machines.

1451629184|5.0|More often than not when a national figure authors a book about his or her experiences, it means co-authored, and leaves you wondering if the work truly reflects the personality of the subject.  Not so with Dugard's introspective, self-questioning, and always poignant recounting of her abduction and 18-year imprisonment--filled with rape, lunatic episodes, birthing, and loneliness--in Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard.  Dugard's case raises a long list of questions about the judicial system's handling of sexual predators, the value and accuracy of psychiatric evaluations, the purpose of parole officers, the insularity of American society--all of which pop into your mind as you read, but none of which are the focus of the book.  The book, as Dugard states, was a therapeutic tool to help her understand and reconcile her life as a captive.  You might wonder how she kept her sanity, why she never tried escaping when opportunities presented themselves, and, most of all, how she never lost hope that she would one day be reunited with her mother and sister.  You'll find the answers in her reflective self-study that speaks volumes about the indomitability of the human spirit.
B0049VQZUA|5.0|i am a year behind in watching this because frankly the last thing i wanted to see was another zombie based show.  i was amazed AMC would get behind the idea following on the heels of its successes with Mad Men and Breaking Bad, two of the best shows on tv.  i should have had more faith.  yes, there are zombies.  but the story arc is really about those who survived, a very few, who continue the struggle to stay alive.  far from concentrating on one zombie battle after another, the struggles among these few survivors is what makes the show a runaway hit.<br /><br />one of the most affecting moments in the show is when one of the survivors loses her sister to the zombies.  she remains with the corpse and no one can budge her.  they think she doesn't realize her sister will come back as a zombie. however, she is well aware of this and is handling her grieving and the final disposition of her sister exclusively.<br /><br />another key moment is when the love affair between two people is brought to a crashing halt when her husband shows up alive.  it turns out that her lover lied to her about her husband's being dead. the two men, once police partners, now must work on surviving together while also being in love with the same woman.<br /><br />all in all, i thought it was great and am eager to now start watching the second season, now playing.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0061689246|3.0|After falling in love with the movie, \\"The Princess Bride\\" and then being blown away by the book, I had been expecting something similar with \\"Stardust.\\"<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn & Jane Goldman took up many of the wonderful, though inadequately explored, characters and situations of this comparatively drab book and exploded them into a wonderful, charming movie.  I wish they had been around to punch of Gaiman's storyline.<br /><br />The ghostly brothers are as faint and dreary as any ghost you'll run across.<br /><br />The hairy little man comes out of nowhere and is never well-explained.  Those wonderful lightening pirates really get short shrift in the book (despite the cover art), and the witch is too easily defeated in the end.<br /><br />I find that I am sorry I read the book; I think I'll fire up the DVD and watch the movie again right now!
B002OSY2T6|5.0|my daughter got this for Christmas and it is absolutely her favorite! she is 4 months old now and thinks its the greatest still. she loves the flashing face and every time she touches it it goes off! i lay her down and place this above her head and she instantly rolls over to get it. she cant get enough of this. defiantly well worth the money for the amount of joy she gets out of this!!!!
0525423281|5.0|Perkin's sophomore effort does not disappoint.  Lola leads a colorful life in San Francisco. She makes elaborate costumes, wears colorful wigs and has a sleuthing best friend. Lola's crescendo builds until she finds herself the point in a triangle. On one side there is Max, the bad boy older boyfriend who has tattoos and is in a band. Her fathers aren't thrilled with her choice but rather than forbid her to see him they lay ground rules for participation.  The third side of the triangle arrives when a moving truck pulls up to the curb. Lola's hope that the contents of the truck belong to another renter and not the owners, are quickly dashed. Her worst nightmare and biggest heart break has returned to the lavender house next door in the form of Cricket.  Cricket has returned to enroll at Berkeley so she doesn't have to deal with him full time but her former best friend and biggest crush is still underfoot more often than not. What happens when she stops minding him being around so much? What about the bad news boyfriend?  Perkin's has delivered another smart, thoughtful and creative young adult novel. There is just the right blend of romance and self-realization to keep the story going without becoming trite. The author takes the relationships that her characters find them in seriously, giving them greater meaning and depth. Big deal relationships can start when you are young.  Anna and Etienne from Perkin's first novel, Anna and the French Kiss, also make frequent appearances, connecting the two books and giving them further life. Lola provides the inverse to Anna; we get to find out what it might be like for the girl who has to make the hard decision instead of Anna's situation, where she was the outsider looking in.  Perkins is a great new voice in young adult realistic fiction. If you are a fan of Sarah Dessen or Siobhan Vivian, here another author in that same vein to add to your must read list.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good app. some games are corny but its neat to have a lot of games in 1. i would recommend if u like simple games.
0920236820|5.0|I have loved this book since my childhood, and am so grateful to have found it hardcover for my daughter. A must read for all little girls, the story is about a problem solving, strong willed princess who saves the day, and is happy to take care of her self if some boy doesn't like her just the way she is. Love Love LOVE this book.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This was given as a Christmas gift.  My son loved it.  It arrived in a very timely manner and was packaged well.  Thanks.

B006E4QCXU|5.0|I am picky about my apps..esp. free ones! But THIS app is a MUST!  It is a great way to mindlessly step away from daily life stresses and get lost in time with this amazing app! Works beautifully on kindle fire! Colors are vibrant and the movement of stars is realistic and fascinating to watch!  Definantly worth the money and you can't go wrong today...its free!
1401923127|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone! It's full of useful information, it takes a new and refreshing approach to science, and even though you're reading about science it keep you turning the pages and wanting to know what he's going to say next!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this app is soo amazing and I am surprised that they made it free for one day. Get it now while.you still can
B0067QPVD2|5.0|I can't believe how good this was! And I really wanted to hate it but couldn't.I have watched it 5 times in one month!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|It's okay for a few minutes, I can't see myself using it again unless the kids wanna mess with it. Expected more, but it is kinda cool. Would not pay for it though.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|Boring. No substance. This could have been so much better if the programmer had incorporated some real-world physics. As it stands, it doesn't work as art, as a game, or even as a good time killer. Uninstalled.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|If you mess with the settings, you can get an undulating hypnotic light dance that soothes and its just plain cool.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Between reading plans and great downloadable Bibles and of course the app is free - makes this the holy trifecta.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Hi am Tuesday.  If you are looking for a great app stop looking becuse you jest fond it. SO BUY IT. I got it as the app of the day but is I bot it. it wood be werth it. B-D
B004EPYZXU|1.0|Essentially a slow-moving horror movie with a sad ending. Giant alien ticks on the moon (that masquerade as moon rocks at first) attack, infest and infect an astronaut mission and then they suffer and die. And can't come home so as not to spread it. And the astronaut supplies only include a strobe light, not a regular flashlight, for dark corners (like NASA didn't have flashlights then). Jeez. Where's my shotgun?    We already have real life horror story with deadly ticks right here on earth, that inject antibiotic-resistant destructive diseases worldwide and in the US - borrelia, babesia, bartonella, erlichia, etc. These are increasing research and clinical problems on all our continents and islands - real, not fictitious, nightmares that can cause prolonged suffering, and most of these bugs hide inside cells and can not be permanently killed off even after the lucky people get it to remiss. Who the f- needs a slow moving horror movie about something similar? We got horror right here on earth.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun, and give a variety of challenges.  you do have to replay many of the completed games to unlock new ones, but its not too rote.
B004SRNH10|2.0|cant get it to work on my samsung phone or kindle fire, dontknow why that is. adobe usually has good stuff
0439023491|5.0|I loved this book. The Hunger Games trilogy are the perfect sci-fi books for everyone who is not used reading that genre. I have never read any sci-fi books before, because I thought I would not like that genre. I started reading the Hunger Games, and simply could not stop reading. The characters are well developed, and so is the story line. The tension throughout the whole story is very good, it never gets boring. Suzanne Collins did an amazing job on describing the characters, they seemed like real people, like they could be me, and that is hard to achieve if the setting is completely fictional and sci-fi.<br />Overall, I loved this book.
B0063IH60K|3.0|its solitaire how much more can you add to it i like it its well worth the download. this games a classic in any app
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I've used this app for about 24 hours and really like it.  It is highly customizable and user-friendly.  I love using the icons for my event but would like to see some church related ones.  A church, cross, Bible, etc.  Thanks for creating a great app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|perfect for your daily dose of Gods word I love the audio capability lets me get the word while. Multics tasking

B004LAIU4I|1.0|I am of Paul Simon's generation - have loved him since the days of S&G.  Graceland was his best release as a single artist.  His most recent release (So Beautiful or So What) was purchased with much anticipation.  It left me sad.  The songs all sound the same, and Paul seems to just talk-sing through most of them.  Yes, it's kind of Paul's \\"thing\\", but just not that good of a CD.  I would recommend purchasing the one song, \\"So Beautiful or So What\\", because that is one worth listening to.  The others?  I recommend that you pass.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Very good at playing most games although i primary bought for diablo 3. Highly recommended that anyone from australia or similar nations to buy it as you get it much cheaper which saves you money and helps out the american economy :).
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I listen to this CD at least once each day, and have done so for the last three months.  I never grow tired of it.  Just an overall outstanding production.  How it missed a Grammy nod is beyond me!  I highly recommend this CD.
B004LWZW4W|1.0|I utterly refuse to buy any more digital combos with blu ray. Reason being is in Guyana where I live when I try to put them on to my iPod the system says the redeemable code is only valid in US and Canada
B006E4QCXU|5.0|first review ever.  but I am blown away.  everything in today's world is set for speed.  this app is one that is just so relaxing.  caveat .. I don't have sound turned on my HTC flyer so I can't speak for music
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book was the greatest book i  have read in fourteen years. i was laughing one moment and sobbing the next. it was a roller coaster for me. i really enjoyed the characters in this book and their view on life. i highly recommend this book.
B004WE01YA|4.0|I liked watching this with my grand daughter.  I thought it was excellent in 3D.  I loved all the characters. This is night and day over the one I saw so many years ago.  Thanks for the opportunity!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|This app was really interesting and cool to play with for about a minute but I'm not really sure what its value is beyond that. Definitely worth a look as the faotd for sure but I wouldn't pay for it outside of that.
B0056BU3I2|4.0|Great action movie! Scored it for a super good price. Came in three days earlier than expected. It's one of the few movies that I don't mind watching over and over.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|Will & Grace is amazing, but this box set is a joke.  For over $100 all you get is a fancy box.  I bought this as a Christmas present for a very good friend of mine that is a HUGE fan.  Me being a huge fan myself, was eager to buy it.  Needless to say it does not work!  Out of 100+ episodes you're lucky to watch maybe 20.  If you buy the 1-8 bundle pack it's cheaper and everything works!  I wish I read the reviews before I purchased this, but I didn't think to read them because it's a freaking DVD!  I have never bought a movie that did not work.  Sad thing now is I wasn't told it didn't work until after the due date to return so i'm now out $200 to buy one box set.  Thanks for the paper weight.  Pull this off your market Amazon!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I love this application for file sharing between my phone, tablet and pc. My pc wouldn't see my other devices when connected by wires. But this application has been great. I was able to easily move pictures, music and books. I can even move video from my phone to my pc or tablet without worrying about the size of the file. This is much easier than trying to use emails for transfers.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Fell in love with this cover for two reasons; one was the protection it offers my newly bought Kindle Fire and the second was the look and the caligraphy script appearance.  So many of the cities on the cover I have visited.  The cover itself has a soft leather feel.  The inside is a soft suede, which helps protect the screen.  It makes it easy to hold the Kindle Fire better when reading for a period of time. I searched and read alot of reviews on other covers as well, but felt this was the one that would work best for the Kindle Fire and it did not disappoint!
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I bought this case for my new Fire, and it was exactly as advertised. It was light weight, offers good protection, most importantly it adds no bulk to your new tablet. The reason for the 3 stars is the easel position. When you tuck the top into the easel position it easily pops loose causing you Kindle to fall over. It also only has one position there are no options to allow a typing angle. If they could offer at least a more secure way to prop up your $200 tablet I would give at least another star.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I wish it gave the ability to take a screenshot or save the image that was uniquely created to my sd card.
0375851569|5.0|Classic books are still some of the best. Just as I remember from my childhood. Still makes me smile. And the rhymes still are tongue twisters.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I am really happy to have this show in my collection! Of course cuz I'm not a genius I don't know most of the definition of most of what's in the script but they make it awesomely funny! Wish I could get season five now but it's still in production!
B00447G2PM|5.0|This was awesome. We viewed this 3D movie on a 55 inch LED with passive 3D. It was like we were in the ocean with the creatures of the deep. And who wouldn't enjoy listening to Johnny and Kate narrate? My sister watched the movie as well and couldn't believe how clear and realistic it was. Good movie at a great price!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|sorry but haven't any of you people noticed that the shadow blade is gone??? other wise a nice game and nice graphics.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|I loved watching the Grand Canyon in 3D. We saw it on a LG 55\\" LED passive 3D TV. The views were spectacular. The message was alarming but then that is the goal of this documentary. Awaken us to the beauty and then remind us we need to be better caretakers. The producers combined beauty and message well. Great 3D. Felt as though you were there. More than I expected.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is great i am telling you great i just love it if you want to play soltare for free this is the best out of all the stupid lazy other ones.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|similar to Grisley manor but not so short.  I would love more games like this.  works great on kindle fire.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I thought this movie was horrible. The first one was okay but the second one is just trying to steal your money.
1451627289|2.0|20 words about this latest from SK?  I have one.  BOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRING. This thing is over 800 pages long.  It shoulda, coulda been a short story.  Interesting premise but too much wandering around in shinola instead of just telling a really good (short) story.  King at his best is a master; at his worst he's a hack.  I got it on Kindle - had I been in a bookstore and able to actually thumb through it, I think I would have put it back on the shelf and bought something else.  My pick for one of King's best (and possibly least-known)book - Gerald's Game.  Now that one was too short.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|the game is fun, but it freezes all the time on the Galaxy Nexus. Updates are very rare and this has been a long standing issue.
B006ZDS7CE|3.0|I admit I bought into the positive hype of the wonderful videos Kinda Out Of Luck, Riding in Cars With Boys, You Can Be The Boss of Me, and Video Games. Only the last of which is on this album and the first how I was left feeling from the loss of the others. I was devistated even more to find even though I ordered a week and a half in advance I was on a wait list the day it was released, so I canceled the Cd and got the MP3. My hopes where riding high with all the youtube videos and songs stuck in my head. After all I was suggested this album by Amazon from my ratings of Leonard Cohen and Norah Jones two of the greats of whiskey and smoke singing. Now looking deeper I find Britney Spears also listed as Lanas influences which speaks volumes to this albums true puppet masters. This is an old tale of the old American studio system where \\"love everything you do baby, now change\\" is every day...a star is born. Jewel, natlie imbrugala, Fiona's Apple have all been there. No question in my mind she will have a hit with Video Game, Blue Jeans, and perhaps even dt. Mt. dew. There is quality here even though it is not all I had hope for but despite it all this Gal has got Class and deserves all the hype and respect and for that alone I am glad to have bought the album. Hope her origanal hits get to the market soon before being bootleged and remixed beyond control. READY TO TAKE ANOTHER RIDE...    ****  If you ENJOY this music be sure to pick up the 3 EXTRA SONGS downloadable off her deluxe edition ****  A few day have past and while my view is still much the same after a few more play throughs I have defined the problems I have.    1. The Back Up Music sounds like a techno and hip hop mixed in after thought.   (Unplugged I would buy this music all over again.)    2. The songs get a little too repetative and on a handful of songs I break down and skip to the next.   (This is likely great for the mix and dj group that already loves her music)  The best part is her voice and after seeing her on youtube, SNL, and Letterman one gets a clue to how she delivers the lyrics dreary and soulful at times with playful hints and a pouting tease dabbled in. Its a digital singles music world and I got it all as I found value doing so but if your hinging you buying on reviews nitpick and take the songs you want shes worth a few spots in ones playlist.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|Just watched this in SD in On Demand. The sound alone is worth buying this movie, the way it is cut together and the plot of the movie put this over as one of my favorite movies of all time.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|It is so cool but i wish i could save some of the images that i wanted to show them to my friend.
B00127RAJY|3.0|so, i am about 30 lbs overweight and figured this would be the jumpstart i needed to get into gear.  i wanted to wait until i was over 1/2 through the video to share my experience.  it is definitely a tough one on the knees with lunge moves, but other than that, you feel a good burn.  i feel muscles toning where they weren't before, so that is good.  still no great abs, but i feel the tummy getting a little more taut.  i have averaged 225 calories burned per workout and they lie about it being 20 min BTW.  start to finish with stretching allow 27 minutes.  but that is not that big a deal.  i just moved to level 3 this morning.  whew is it tough!  as for the weight loss?  negligible.  i may have lost 3 so far.  i know toning muscles is important too, but not seeing that number on the scale budge is very discouraging.  i still have a treat or 2, but 3-4 days a week i have a salad for lunch, sometimes soup and others a lean cuisine meal.  i bring in 2 pieces of fruit to work, often i have a bag of baby carrots for a snack.  in addition to jm30ds, i still am at the YMCA 3X a week for about an hour-1/2 cardio, 1/2 strength.  my body is just the way it is :(
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Though this app does not do a lot, what it does do is lovely. Put a finger--or two or three--anywhere and watch the &quot;stars&quot; fly toward or away from you. Create patterns, star systems, galaxies--even black holes. No, it is not challenging, but that's its beauty. It just is.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The DVD is quick and effective. In the first five min. I was sweating and in need of some ice cold H2O. I work out four day a week in the gym, doing mostly intense weight lifting. This video incorporates both cardio and weight lift toning, which helps create a tight toned look that many woman want to achieve. Today was my first day doing the workout, so I don't have the physical results all the other reviews talk about. From the way I was panting and legs trembling I guarantee I will see wonderful results. Love Jillian's style and motivation.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this game, and I use the word game loosely,  is an enjoyable addition to anyone's app archives. I would have never scean it if it was not a free app today. playing this has made me really consider buying anything else the developer makes in the future. normally $1.99 I would now buy it if for some reason I could no longer play it.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Most horrible movie I've seen in years.. Terrible! don't buy this, you will be sorry.  Not fun at all and a waste of money
B005IU1OMA|3.0|Bought Art of Flight from Amazon, it included 2 dvd's.  One of them appears to be blank.  Anyone know what's up with that?  A good product, although some of the scenes like crashing into the dead tree, are too repetitive for me.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Without a doubt my favorite cd. I could listen to it everyday. This girl has it! I have bought it for friends and family members. No matter someone's taste everyone seems to appreciate Adele.
030788743X|5.0|Once in a great while something really new and memorable comes along ! Once again, I got the audio version and listened while driving the lost highway. The central character is easy to like and the story moves along briskly . I'm more psychically fused with the 70's than the 80's but that didn't interfere with appreciating the detailed description of the myriad forms cultural minutiae from the Gen X Decade. There isn't much physical description of Wade Watts but one gets to know his avatar very well. This is a fun read . Don't wait for the inevitable movie version.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this app is beyond incredible I just wish it could be a live wall paper but it still is amazing
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Downloaded app for kids and, before I realized it, spent 30 minutes playing around with the various settings and effects.  Works as advertised. Wonderful interactive experience....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game!! I cant wait to unlock more games! it works great on my.kindle fire :) it makes time disappear. you know you want to download this game! hasn't. messed up on me yet!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|This album was previewed on the Guardian newspaper web site and from the first song to the last I was completely enchanted. I immediately pre-ordered the album, which is my favorite Cohen album to date. I especially love \\"Amen\\" and \\"Crazy to Love You\\", but when I play this (and I am playing it a lot)I am not even tempted to skip any of the songs.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|... but I can't. app freezes on HTC inspire. it looks really fun though. I love apps that are just creative fun.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|I read this short story (it wasnt a book as so many reviewers are stating) when i was 15 years old.  I was home alone in Oregon, in a house i lived in with my dad.... in the woods, in a small town called Kirby.  dad was at work.  Big mistake.  This story scared the Hell out of me and i knew right away that one day it would make a great film.  Years later when i read Darabont was taking the helm i could not have been more excited.  This film blew me away.  From character development, to the realization of the monsters....especially the spiders!! holy crap.  what a ride.  easily one of my favorite top 5 horror movies. perfectly paced, well acted and written, and beautifully shot.  I hear alot of people bashing the ending.  why?  did it provoke an emotional response?? Hell yeah!! thats art people.  life isnt all sugar and spice and shiny vampires.  Not since the ending of \\"Seven\\" has there been a punch in the stomach ending like this. This is a nearly perfect movie in my opinion.  what really makes this movie work isnt even the monsters.  Its really not even about them....its about the human drama and what happens to people placed in a very confined and traumatic, inescapable experience.  and as always....religion enters into it.  ooohhhh the fireworks.  a fine, fine film.
1400032717|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite book of all time! If you have time and want a easy read, then this is the book for you. I love the way the author described everything in this book. Super awesome.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|I got this cover for my kindle fire.  It fits!  No issue whatsoever and its just beautiful.  I use my Kindle Fire at church/bible study and it's just perfect.  High end leather.  Beautiful.  I like the pocket inside, as well.  Keep a few notes in it.  You won't be disapopinted by the beauty of it.

B001HN6922|5.0|I purchased Cars 2 for my grand nephew, 4 years old.  He like so many other kids likes anything on wheels according to his mom and I felt this was great for him.  He watched it several times during his trip to Florida.  I was concerned it would not get here in time for his trip but it did arrive in plenty of time and in excellent condition.  Would definitely recommend this for any child who loves cars (what male doesn't?).
B001TH7GT6|5.0|definitively well worth the price, cable were very well boxed and delivery was prompt.  Quality is also just great.  I would recommend to anyone looking a for set of inexpensive cables.

B000JVSUS4|5.0|To all the complainers: This is a movie made to entertain the people watching it. It is not a DOCUMENTARY, so some parts may be exaggerated and not exactly accurate from a historical standpoint, however it is an enjoyable film with a good story line and lots of action.
B002VRZEYM|1.0|Wow.  What a terrible, terrible \\"documentary.\\"  Completely one sided and the only word that kept coming to my mind was \\"duh\\" while watching this craptacular movie.  Zero stars.
B000LPS4BG|4.0|I'm all about Blu-ray.  Stopped buying DVDs a long time ago.  This was a great deal for $5.49 & FREE SHIPPING!  Wouldn't buy this at the current $11.49 price considering the image isn't great for a Blu-ray. Still better than DVD though.  Most old movies are transferred poorly and this is one of them. However, it's still a great film, and honestly, some movies don't need to be perfect.  The age gives them character.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Bogart and Bergman. Great plot. Great acting. It's a classic that anyone who likes classic will like. I broke down and got it after seeing it on TCM a month ago. I need to see it more than once every 2 years.
0307959856|3.0|I would give this book three-and-a-half stars if I could; beautifully written in the style of Jane Austen, I think James got the pacing right, but the trademark wit and humor were missing. There were touches of it, but the emphasis here was on a murder, not a comedy of manners, and that part was handled admirably by P.D. James. The problem for me, however, was that I found stretches of the novel dull, mired down in exposition. I realize that was necessary to wrap up all the myriad loose ends and explain the intricate plot and character motivations; I'm a historical mystery fan and don't expect (or want) the pace of a modern-day, high-octane thriller, but the pace here was glacial in parts. In fairness, what I found lacking in the book was not James' fault in the execution, but mine for my unrealistic expectations; she was taking on a beloved cultural icon of a novel and had to squeeze it and it's characters into the strictures of a country-house murder (also a beloved cultural icon to some of us!) and that's a tall order. If anyone could pull it off, I believe James is uniquely qualified - I say that as a long-time fan of her contemplative, melancholy Adam Dalgliesh mysteries. But in those slogging patches of exposition I couldn't help feeling even her considerable powers were tested by trying to reconcile two genres.<br /><br />By the time I was about a third of the way into the book I was disappointed and discussed the book online with some fellow Amazon readers, and they brought up some very good points that helped me put the book in perspective for what it was and was not. James wasn't trying to take on an iconic literary character, Elizabeth Bennett, but rather give an accurate picture of how a murder among the landed gentry in Regency England would play out. This she did very well and with historical accuracy, as far as I know, and I found her insights into Mr. Darcy interesting and realistic; as another reviewer here pointed out, we never really got inside of his head in Austen's novel, so this was a chance to get a glimpse into a complicated, private personality. James' delving into his inner thoughts stirred fond memories of Dalgliesh for me, and made Darcy a much more sympathetic character. I did find some of the resolutions in the last few pages a bit forced, however, and they felt like an excuse to mention other memorable Austen characters (although I loved it, as an Austen fan!).<br /><br />I've had several weeks since reading the book to mull it over and revised my review to further explain my three-star rating. It's hard when a book is this well-written to rate it as just \\"okay\\", but when I have to cajole myself into picking up a book to finish it, that's got to be three stars or less, or I feel I'm not being honest! Obviously some reviewers here feel differently and give strong arguments for and against the book; I tried to look at it as a historical mystery using already famous characters and whether the author was successful in putting the two together. Using that criteria I felt like it worked about 60-70% of the time, hence my three-three-and-a-half star rating (math is not my strong suit but I hope that makes sense). I would recommend this book to historical mystery fans and James and Austen fans, but not Austen purists - I think their standards are rather stringent and they wouldn't get much out of this.in Austen's novel, so this was a chance to get a glimpse into a complicated, private personality.

B0009X7664|5.0|I absolutely love everything about this movie. It's just so intriguing to me. It makes me want to go back and live in the Great Depression. Strange. I know.
0307352145|5.0|I loved this book! I learned a lot about myself and why I do certain things. The pieces just fall into place. As a teacher, I learned a lot about why many of my students do the things they do.  The book is well researched. But it's also easy to read, full of stories of people with experiences not unlike my own.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|DRIVE is a fascinating character study, one that uses a minimum of words to define a complex character in a manner than seems terrifyingly quiet and mesmerizing. Based on a book written by James Sallis the screenplay is the  minimalist yet secure writing of Iranian writer Hossein Amini (Wings of the Dove, The Four Feathers, Jude, Shanghai, Kill Shot, etc). Nicolas Winding Refn is the sensitive director who takes advantage of the pauses in the storyline, allowing cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel to bring this mysterious story to life.<br /><br />An unnamed young man referred to as Driver (Ryan Gosling) is a loner, holding down several jobs as a Hollywood stunt driver, a garage mechanic, and a getaway driver who participates in robberies as a silent, by his own rules driver. He works for garage owner, the crippled Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who in turn works for criminals Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman). Driver meets his apartment house neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos) and while there seems to be a chemistry quietly building between them, Driver is told that Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) has been in prison and will be coming home soon.  Driver, Irene and Benicio bond and when Standard is finally released from prison Driver learns that Standard owes a huge protection debt and to befriend the only people about whom Driver cares, he agrees to help in a getaway car that turns very wrong. From this point the normally gentle and quiet driver transforms into a brutal man and the rest of the film is full of terror.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling is splendid in his role as the driver, saying more with his eyes and his body language and his silences than many actors say with a full script.  Carey Mulligan is likewise strong and the supporting roles by Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks, James Biberi and even Russ Tamblyn (!) are superlative cameos.  This is a tough film, full of graphic violence, but it is such a unique story and is so well acted and directed that it is one of the year's most surprising quality movies.

0307949486|3.0|O.K., so it's a fairly good read; it kept me somewhat entertained...  The ending(s?) for \\"the search for Harriet, and the Wennerstroem affair\\" were so bogus/anticlimactic.  I was actually glad when the book was over, and left me wondering why I had kept turning the pages.  Didn't do much for me.  Save your money.
B0068RHGJM|4.0|I just open the box hoping to listen some music and open the booklet but to my huge surprise special edition is in fact \\"stripped down\\" edition - besides the box and 2 cds there's nothing else inside. I contacted amazon but was told that in the description of the item booklet is not mentioned therefore the assumption is this edition has none.  Surprisingly Amazon UK for the same edition states that:  \\"This limited edition double CD digibook includes the full album on disc 1, instrumental versions of the album on disc 2, a poster and booklet.\\"  And then somebody wonders why people don't buy cds anymore.  02/10/20102 update  I talked to amazon customer service again about the issue described above. Chris (support rep) was very helpful. He send me another copy of CD so I could take a look if there were any extras included. This time the booklet was included. I kept the booklet and sent the rest back to amazon. All free of any charge.  Other then the issue above. It's another solid album from Nightwish. Maybe not my favorite but i keep listening it over and over again.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I went to see this movie in the theaters in 1994, and as I recall it was one of those \\"just pick a movie to go see\\" type of nights. Picked this movie for no particular reason, heck I don't think I even knew what it was about. Theater was packed though, and I believe it might have been the opening weekend. I remember sitting there, watching it, and really being incredibly moved. I hadn't expected that, and the rather long movie just flew by. I'm now 43, which would have made me what, 20-something back in 1994. 20-something GUYS don't get emotional in movies. Right? Well, this was the first movie I ever shed a tear in. Tears of sadness, tears of joy, it was quite an experience. I'd never connected with a character in a movie like that before (or since).  Last weekend, 2012 now, this movie was on TV and I happened to cross channels with it. I had forgotten about most of it, and it was like watching it again for the first time. Complete with the emotions. Really, if for some strange reason you never watched this movie, watch it. But sit down and watch the whole thing, no distractions. It is definitely one of the greatest pieces of work Tom Hanks has ever done, and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time.

B004WQ2L9G|4.0|I'm a big Liszt fan and personally urge this purchase !!<br /><br />The \\"Consolations\\" for piano #1-6 are heartfelt and soothing. The \\"Years of Pilgrimage\\" \\"Pastoral\\" is my favorite piece in all of classical musicdom! Lazar Berman does a fantastic cycle on all three of the \\"Years of Pilgrimage\\" sets of compositions !!<br /><br />Liszt can make you cry with his mastery of musical art. He touches deep into the soul with some pieces.<br /><br />However, some leider does sound old.<br /><br />I highly recommend Jorges Bolets version of the \\"Grand Etudes\\" also known as the \\"Transcendental Suites\\" instead of the feverishly RUSHED !!!! version in this set. All else is fine and competent. All 30 + cd's loaded perfectly on my computer !!!<br /><br />Liszt was the greatest classical rock star ever known. His life story should be made into a hollywood blockbuster or television series! Once when the paid female forgot to faint on que during Liszt's concert.....he promptly fainted instead. All should read his long life biography.<br /><br />Good day!

1612130283|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is like a gravitational pull, it sucks you in and never lets you go! Once you read this book it sticks with you and you will never forget the fifty shades of Christian Grey!<br /><br />Christian Grey is a powerful, rich and very controlling CEO.  He is a man who has it all, but even though he could have anything he wants, he is haunted and tortured by a past he just can't seem to get past.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is a literary college student.  Who likes books and even though you would think she knows things and how the world turns, well she isn't as knowledgeable as one would think.<br /><br />When she is drafted into interviewing Christian for her friend Kate, all it takes is one trip into his office and Christian Grey is smitten with Anastasia.  He tries hard to stay away from her, but its like a moth drawn to a flame, he just can't stay away.  Will she be caught up in his controlling ways or will Christian be able to fight against who he is and his past and truly fall in love with Anastasia Steele?<br /><br />I loved this book, its very different from what I've been reading so it was a great break away from the YA fiction.  I love the Characters and the plot, I will say this though, I hated where it ended.  Not really hate \\"hate\\" per-say, no I just needed more of the story and I was screaming at my computer for more. I could never hate this book its too incredible.<br /><br />I loved that Christian seems so strong but underneath his mask he is damaged and not as strong as he tries so hard to be.  I love how Anastasia wants to love Christian, but she isn't sure she is good enough for him or if she can be what he wants.  It just shows that no on is perfect!<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next book in this series and will as soon as I get it to read.  The descriptions in this book are amazing.  I could watch this book in my head as I read, like a movie playing out in my mind! I love love love Fifty Shades of Grey.  E.L. James is an incredibly Wonderful Author!!

B005FISBTO|3.0|Dexter hasn't reached the Weeds of really great series' gone down hill, but this is the worst season so far.  I liked the light/dark religious thing and the idea of him having some humanity.  The writing is the main thing that bothered me:    -The main thing that bothered me was that I feel like the writers forgot that the detectives didn't know Gellar was dead and they kept focusing there search on Travis instead of Gellar.  - There usually isn't a bunch of holes in regarding 'why hasn't dexter been caught,' but there were a ton in this season and he took much bigger risks then he should have(there had to be cameras, which he was never worried about)  - They had a bunch of side plots that never panned out to be anything:  The hand, Deb's crush, Matthews getting fired,etc.  Its cool to have some cliff hanger, but they didn't even try to wrap these up. They shouldn't have introduced the side plots if they weren't going to have the time to wrap them up.

B0036S4C6G|3.0|How should one choose what one reads? I am following an eclectic regime dictated by my old favorites and by recommendations from amazon friends (though they don't exist anymore). Sometimes I add an award winner, say a Man Booker or a Pulitzer or a National Book Award winner. That approach is not always rewarding.<br /><br />Case in point is this 2011 Pulitzer winner. Interesting, amusing, but in a flat way. No really interesting people in it. No really great language either. Hardly a novel, more like stories linked by their cast. Some in NY, some post 9-11, some elsewhere at other times, some in different styles. The main characters of each story appear as supporting cast  in other chapters. Good overall plotting can't replace interesting contents though. This is competent but meaningless. While one might enjoy reading it, one will surely not remember a word of it next year. And the stories, even if they deal with tragic things, they are still fluff.<br />But if I don't read it, how do I know it is fluff? The book has just been published in Germany and has received a rave review from Die Zeit. Hm.<br /><br />What is it about? Mostly about pop music and pop musicians, and the related subculture.<br /><br />We learn about a kleptomaniac, her shrink sessions, and a particular adventure when her one night stand inadvertently nearly makes her get caught for lifting a wallet from a woman in the ladies' washroom.<br /><br />Or about a manager of a record label who suffers from a loss of sex drive, who wonders if that loss is not a good thing. He also has a need to divulge, and a penchant for betrayal bonding when out with his son.<br />Or about a punk band in SF in the late 70s, groupies included. The usual about drugs and teenage sex and so on.<br />About an LA record producer on safari in Africa with kids and girlfriend. The usual about messy families. Kids grow up, they fail or succeed, they kill themselves or become addicts or both, they visit their dying elders in hospital or not...<br />Or about a PR agent who represents a foreign dictator, trying to brighten his image, but her plans seem to take a bad turn.<br />Or about a celebrity reporter who is overwhelmed by his attractive interviewee and tries to rape her.<br />And some more.<br />And then the insult of chapter 12: it is told in PowerPoint charts. I refuse to read this as a matter of principle. I have to use this silly software all the time. I do think, actually, that it makes us stupider by making work easier.<br /><br />The first really interesting chapter comes half into the novel, the 7th of 13, when the not quite convincingly Caucasian record label manager moves to an upper class NY suburb and gets implicitly suspected as terror network operative. Is that enough for raving? Maybe for a move from 3 to 4 stars. There are other post 9-11 observations strewn over various chapters, which do add some substance to pure pop. I get the impression that this is a smart writer who could have done better. Not a stupid book, but a limited choice of subject. And I will not need a whole year to forget it.<br />3 and a half stars.a foreign dictator, trying to brighten his image, but her plans seem to take a bad turn.

B006E4QCXU|4.0|Didn't think there'd be much to it based on the description. 30 minutes later I find that I'm still entranced by little swirling pixels. Perfect for getting through a long conference call. Not so engaging that I lose focus, but just enough to keep me from going mad with boredom.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|16 hours.  I can hardly believe it.  At first, I thought \\"Is that all this app does?\\"  But, in the interest of fairness, I decided to watch it a little longer.  My mistake.  Those few minutes turned into an hour.  Then the hours started ticking by.  Fortunately, the reality of battery life finally broke the diabolical hold this application had on my brain.  Thank goodness I had the presence of mind to leave my phone off the charger, or I'd probably still be watching it.  Oh, but how wonderful the world was while I was mesmerized.  Everything seemed better.  I didn't eat, but I didn't care.  All my needs, hopes, desires, worries, and pains were simply melted away as the patterns of light slowly burned their way deeper into my subconscious.  Five stars for that, but one star off because of how devious the application turned out to be.  You've been warned!

B006BDHAX0|3.0|I've enjoyed playing version 1.1.2 of this game on my XOOM since it was the FAOTD a month ago, with no crashing problems, although I don't usually play more than two games in a row (b/c then I get confused on whether tiles were played in the current or a previous game). Only glitch is that the star-ratings do not work at all, but I don't mind that. (Oh, and it is hard to tell apart the Seasons and Flowers tiles; they look about the same.)  Now the \\"update\\" to 1.1.4 wants permissions for full internet access to open network sockets and wants to know my location??? I can understand possibly needing those permissions in a free version that would have advertisements, but why does the dev need those permissions in a paid version? If the permissions are legitimate, then give an explanation, please. I really appreciated that version 1.1.2 required NO special permissions (although I do wish that it would write to SD card, since it is such a large file). Unless the developer gives a satisfactory explanation for these new permissions, I will not be updating to a newer version at this time.
0571283586|4.0|Jane Austen's ironic style is perfectly captured in this atmospheric novel.  The character of Elizabeth is unfortunately less fully developed than I would wish.  The \\"mystery\\" is not up to James's usual standard.  However, this is one of the best of the many sequels to Austen's novels. Mr. Bennet lives up to Austen's depiction and D'Arcy is more  fully delineated than in P. and P.

B000JCQCW4|5.0|Requiem for a Dream goes beyond drugs. Yes, it follows four addicts and shows their spiral into a living nightmare; however, it hits at something much deeper. If you buy it and proceed to watch it, look closely at what makes the characters feel good. If you have watched it, remember why Harry's mom wanted to be thin, go into it. Remember what Maryann told Harry in the first half, what he made her feel like. And of course, remember Tyrone's \\"flashbacks.\\"  Finally, remember the guys at the party with \\"maid maryann.\\" This movie hits hard. This movie hits at the core.  Oh! And yes, five stars without a doubt. Wowzah.  (WARNING: DO NOT WATCH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES!)
B0036TGT3E|5.0|As owner of all of Disney's hand-drawn theatrical release films on Blu-rays, I have to say that Disney is the one studio who is just about perfect. The only down point has been \\"Beauty & the Beast\\", which problems seems to originate from the IMAX masters of the film itself & not it's transfers (you can check my very controversial review here at Amazon).<br /><br />But never mind that, let's talk about \\"The Lion King\\". The video image on this Blu-ray is just perfect. There is no banding, no artifacts, no grain, no specks, it's just pristine. I was a little leery about buying this, as \\"The Lion King\\" was also released as an IMAX film & I feared the same problems that \\"Beauty & the Beast\\" had would be present here. I did not see \\"The Lion King\\" in IMAX, so I don't know if the problems were present in that release, but be assured, there are no problems at all in this Blu-Ray release. The sound on this Blu-ray is also perfect. From the deep rumblings of the elephants steps to the high-pitched winds in the songs, the sound is clear & crisp.<br /><br />As with most Disney Blu-rays, the extras are filled with everything you would want to know about the film & even it's Broadway play.<br /><br />Bottom line, a definite buy for Disney fans.

B004A8ZWXS|4.0|On paper, this film must have appeared to be a tired contrivance-- so many cliches, so little to hold it together.  Yet, somehow, after making films for 40 years, Spielberg continues to get better and better at what he does better than anybody else.  One might say that the Spielberg film is a contradiction to the phrase \\"they don't make them like they used to.\\"  Well, Spielberg does-- and in some ways better than anybody ever has.  That isn't to say a movie like War Horse is going to offer new insights into the human condition, but it does breathe new life into the hopeful, sugar coated miracle stuff that Hollywood lives and breathes on.  The images in this film are truly breathtaking.  And, it should be said, they go beyond cliche and achieve poetry.  It may be a kind of commercial poetry, but it is beautiful nonetheless.  And though many of the situations feel fake (especially one with a sick child and her kindly grandfather), and some of the sequences just reek of manipulation, most of them work wonderfully.  As much as I resisted, I teared up a couple of times.  Cynics may disagree, but I think Spielberg has an extraordinary and authentic emotional sense-- and I choose to believe its genuine.  The camera movement, the blocking-- the very conception of so many shots --  all function to communicate straight to the heart.  Just contrast the simple emotion in this film to a much more famous-- but much more fraudulent film--  Forest Gump.  Both films, of course, are wonderfully executed pieces of cinema magic.  But while both are fairy tales, and both play upon our desire for wishes to come true,  there's a big difference.  In this film (like most of Spielberg's movies), the simple emotion comes from basic truths.  People make fools of themselves,  horses (and farms) get lost to the boss man and to war.  Hard work means a lot but it doesn't always produce the desired result.  But sometimes, you get back what you lose.  Life isn't random, but it does spin off many colors.  In Forest Gump, on the other hand, the meek not only inherit the earth, they also get to own their own conglomerate!  And not only that-- those who work the hardest for change are shown up as fools.  Thus, Forest Gump turns out to be based on a Big Lie -- the lie that Reagan sold to America--  that brains and creative thinking-- and daring-- were the road to death (Jennie) or disfigurement (Dan).  Of course we know now that Reagan and his Big Lie actually destroyed the middle class-- and ruined our country.  But Big Business keeps propping up the Reagan brand since his laissez-faire narrative made them rich at everyone else's expense.  Spielberg's film, as mentioned before, is also a fairy tale.  But it doesn't pretend (as does Forest Gump) to offer a new spin to a key decade in history.  Gump is a travesty of the '60s-- and a slap in the face of real heroes like MLK and Robert Kennedy.  War Horse's connection with WW1 is purely casual.  This is not a film about a moment in time-- it is just a series of warm and fuzzy dreams that show us as we would like to be, and remind us that life is better when we are humble, kind, and a little brave.  No-- we don't get Bubba Gump Shrimp company t-shirts or the Porsche that Bob Zemeckis probably drives around in.  What we get-- and keep-- are our souls.  So-- don't go see War Horse expecting a serious work of art (unless you accept Damien Hirst's definition of art as \\"anything done super well.\\")  But do go if you want to experience Hollywood magic (for better or for worse)  at its finest.  Bravo Spielberg.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I became a fan of Bruno Mars way later than most people. I always liked his voice but never got too into him, until after I heard him perform \\"Valerie\\" on MTV as a tribute to Amy Winehouse, after that I was hooked. So I purchased the album and also his EP, and I can't get enough of him! He is clearly super talented not only in song writing but his voice is mesmerizing and a TRUE talent. You can listen to the live recordings, or even go to youtube and search for him in concert, and his voice is just as amazing live as on the album, which is rare now days. He has said himself that his lyrics are simple ans to the point, and he is right which is why I love him even more. Some songs are obviously superior to others, but all in all I greatly enjoy each song on the album, there isn't one that I don't listen to.<br />I believe \\"Talking To The Moon\\" should have been released as a single, because it is a wonderful song and his voice is beautiful. I feel like you can feel his emotion through his voice in each song. His voice has even made me enjoy the rap songs he is featured in, when I usually hate rap! I can't wait for his next album, I feel like it will be even better.

B0037BV1PW|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2010 SHM-CD REMASTER FROM JAPAN ***<br /><br />Fans of JT will know that only 3-tracks from \\"Mud Slide Slim\\" are available as remasters - \\"You've Got A Friend\\",  \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" and \\"Long Ago And Far Away\\" - all of them on the Warners Brothers/Rhino 'Best Of' compilation \\"You've Got A Friend\\" from 2003. And sweet they sound too...<br /><br />But this Japan-only SHM-CD released 7 April 2010 on Warner Brothers WPCD-13820 (barcode: 4943674097319) is the first time the entire album has been remastered since its release on a dull-sounding US/European CD in the mid Eighties. And as one of the first vinyl albums I ever bought as a kid and loved to bits - I'm thrilled to say that the 40-year wait has been worth it - because the audio quality on this CD reissue is BEAUTIFUL.<br /><br />Part of a 6-album campaign (see list below), this 2010 remaster (37:34 minutes) was done by ISAO KIKUCHI in Japan and it's a limited edition (non-numbered) on the SHM-CD format. Super High Materials CDs do not require a specific machine to play them on - they're simply a better form of disc created by JVC in 2008 to improve on the original format (unchanged since it was first put out 30 years ago). The general idea is that the sound on the SHM-CD is more defined as they play - they seem to extract more nuances from the transfer - and of the 8 or so that I own - I've found this to be true.<br /><br />The 5\\" mini repro packaging here apes the April 1971 USA vinyl release on Warner Brothers WS 2561 with its hard-card gatefold artwork (lyrics and recording details on the inside). The outer resealable bag it has to be said is very flimsy, so extracting and replacing the sleeve has to be done carefully lest you rip it. The 12-page plain white booklet is very ho-hum too - just lyrics and an essay in Japanese that you can't read. No pictures - nothing new. At least the rounded white paper inner bag has one of those protective poly-slips inside it to protect the CD. The disc itself repro's the green Warner Brothers label of the original vinyl album too - a nice touch. It's tastefully done as always with these releases. But it's all about the sound here...<br /><br />Right from the opening bars of \\"Love Has Brought Me Around\\" you can suddenly hear the instruments - especially Leland Sklar and Russ Kunkel on Bass and Drums - so sweet and warm. Other highlights include the Banjo of John Hartford and Fiddle of Richard Green on \\"Riding On A Railroad\\" - much clearer now - as is the lovely accordion playing of Kevin Kelly on \\"Places In My Past\\".<br /><br />As everyone knows \\"You've Got A Friend\\" was written by CAROLE KING and first turned up on her magnificent \\"Tapestry\\" album at almost the same time of release - April 1971. What is perhaps not stated enough is her overall contribution to James Taylor's \\"Mud Slide Slim\\" in that she played piano on 7 of its 13 tracks (harmonizing on others too) - and always with that beautiful melody she seemed to effortlessly get. It underpins \\"Hey Mister, That's Me Up On The Jukebox\\" (lyrics above title this review) and \\"Highway Son\\". The other beautiful lady contributing to proceedings is of course JONI MITCHELL who puts in rare guest vocal appearances on \\"You've Got A Friend\\" and the gorgeous \\"Long Ago And Far Away\\" - both sounding so much more defined here. If I was pushed, I'd say the best-sounding tracks on here are \\"Machine Gun Kelly\\" and \\"Soldiers\\" - the acoustic guitars, the rhythm section - all very, very sweet indeed.<br /><br />Downsides - it's Japanese only, a limited edition and expensive. And the booklet could have done with some more pizzazz instead of the rather safe presentation it did get.<br /><br />But if you've got any kind of love for this Seventies singer-songwriter album - then you owe it to yourself to acquire this SHM-CD version of it. Lovely, lovely stuff - and I'm saving up to get the rest...<br /><br />PS: the albums remastered in Japan in this April 2010 series are:<br/>1. Sweet Baby James (March 1970) on Warner Brothers WPCR-13819<br />2. Mud Slide Slim And The Blue Horizon (July 1971) on Warner Brothers WPCR-13820<br />3.

B0059XTTXC|2.0|*** BLU RAY REVIEW ***<br /><br />There's a sequence in this dreadfully slow and boring movie that's worth bigging up because it's better than five-stars. I'd even go as far as saying that it's a serious contender for a top-ten placing in the best 'acting' ever put on screen. Gary Oldman has been almost comatose cold for most of the movie (as befits his character) - but then about halfway through the dense unfolding plot - he sits down with Benedict Cumberbatch (how good is he) at his home with a bottle of spirits and both get quietly blotto. Loosened up and now distinctly human, George Smiley (Oldham's MI5 character) then regales a story to Cumberbatch about how he met and sussed out a fanatical Russian spy. Oldham isn't just good in it - he's absolutely sensational. And the camera barely comes off him for maybe six or seven minutes. It's a huge amount of dialogue to remember and stay in the moment as he recounts it. If you're wondering why he was Oscar nominated - this extraordinary segment is surely the reason why.<br /><br />Mark Strong puts in the best performance of his career too - there are times when I swear you can literally see what his character is thinking - beautifully subtle work. Colin Firth and Tom Hardy are superb also. The rest of the top-notch cast are the cream of British actors - an A-list to die for - and all honour that. But as you've probably gathered from a slew of one-star reviews (some of them even openly hostile) - \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\" has still somehow managed to feel like having your teeth pulled - and without the payoff either.<br /><br />And this is before you have to contend with the dire WASHED-OUT LOOK of the BLU RAY PRINT. It tries to ape Seventies \\"French Connection\\" like grittiness and it's just awful. It absolutely wrecks 80% of the scenes - blocking - blurriness. I know it's supposed to be a seedy tale about seedy men in a seedy business - but it just feels like amateur hour - you think you're watching some crappy pirate video.<br /><br />As I say - it isn't all deathly dreary offices, grey filing cabinets and stale Jacob's Cream Crackers with your tea - as some reviewers have tried to claim. There are genuine moments of greatness in here. It's just that there aren't enough of them - and the main bulk of the feature is a stone cold drag (intentional or not).<br /><br />Still - good luck on the night Mister Oldman - you thoroughly deserve your nomination and a win. I just wish the film you got it for had aroused the same level of affection...all deathly dreary offices, grey filing cabinets and stale Jacob's Cream Crackers with your tea - as some reviewers have tried to claim.

B000JLTRKE|5.0|this is an excellent portrayal of just some of the horrific deeds the terrorists inflicted on innocent people on 911.  i have been to ground zero and as of last year, there will be years passed before the scene will even resemble was it was before 911.  just impossible to imagine what those families have gone through all because of someone's hatred for virtual strangers.  sick!
B006W0QOF2|2.0|Interesting driving scenes, but slow for what I thought was an action movie. I imagine the preview had all the action scene, so don't expect much action.  There are is probably 30 minutes of the main character just starting off into space, which is a complete waste of my time. This must be one of the \\"artistic\\" movies.

B006E4QCXU|5.0|Fun and well made app. I would love to see it in color, but I can't figure out how to access the settings on my Nook tablet. Great app anyway.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|the most useless thing i have ever seen for android. glad i got it for free. not worth the download time.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I already owned Band of Brothers, and since this was produced by Tom hanks and Steven Spielberg, I thought I was in for a real treat. Don't let the directors or the packaging fool you into this being anything like Band of Brothers. I felt everything from the plot, acting, and combat scenes were subpar. Don't get me wrong, the scenes of the marines invading the islands are pretty impressive, but thats were anything impressive stops. Yes, this series does focus closely on a few marines. The only problem is there is only two that the story keeps focusing on. Some of the actors you think are main characters either die or mysteriously disappear. I bought this to focus on the war, on the action, and see the MAIN CHARACTERS develop a bond along with assisting the story to develop. None of this happened so I am awarding this series 1-Star. Seriously, just buy a paper weight that is the same shape and size as this collection because you will get more joy out of it.
0061992860|5.0|the size is the best part..pocket size! it is your standard sas survival guide. it will keep you alive and can live in your back pocket
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Great app although I wish it could incorporate my phone book for call reminders and allow me to dial straight from the app as oppose to closing and looking up # and then dialing hope to see in update
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome GAME!!!! it is a good game fir people who want to play a veriaty of games it is insane
B005K17RU0|5.0|accurate, fast, detailed, and easy to use. I use it every day. I especially like to radar map in motion.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I gotta be honest, i initially bought this sharpener just to use in my survival kit as it is small and offers the serration sharpener.  But before stashing it in the kit, first i decided to test it.  Took one of my older worn down Gerber fixed blades, chopped it into the curb to dent the blade a bit and grabbed my PP1.  After 15 swipes through the coarse side and ten on the smooth side the blade was pretty darn clean.  It was visibly sharper and the two large chunks were barely noticeable.  After a few minutes sitting in front of the TV playing around the blade was good as new.  Before the sharpener ever made it into my survival kit i sharpened my daily-use tactical knives, several throwing knives, a throwing axe and some of our kitchen knives.  WARNING: while the PP1 did wonders sharpening our kitchen knives, it did scuff up the finish on my  nicer kitchen set.  Now the knives in the kitchen block are sharper than ever but some are not as shiny.  To sum it up: AMAZING little sharpener, perfect for campers, hunters, survivalists or anyone using real knives or blades.  Compact, reliable, easy to use, easy to clean, easy to pack.  And for $10 or less... its a great gift.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|The product doesn't work well as it amplified background noise more than anything else and it is basically useless. You will hear the droning noise of electronics, the ruffle sound of the unit as it touches other things and the sound of your hand touching the unit the most. You will end up turning up the volume more just to hear the things you are trying to hear and find yourself going deaf from the even louder background noise also being amplified. The microphone is also not really directional, contrary to it's looks.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I think it will be a great game yet it takes a long time to install. I am excited to play it
B005K17RU0|5.0|this has proven to be just what I wanted.. you will be happy you tried it. and the forecasts have been accurate.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this is an awesome app but the games at the beginning were really hard for my daughter. It kept telling her that she didn't have enough points to unlock something. When she got 4,000 points it still told her that she didn't have enough coins. Other than that it is an awesome app. I use it when I'm bored or just want to do something.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a very good game because it has over 101 games and plus it has eighteen games. it is awesome
B006E4QCXU|5.0|While I've picked up quite a few free games, I think I'll actually USE this. Very relaxing and fun to play with. Kind of like a Zen garden. Wish it had some relaxing music choices with it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this on the kindle fire and I usually have to steal it back from my boyfriend because he loves playing the games too
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game but there are a lot of adds, snake game is stupid though word word word word word word
0307408833|1.0|This book comes off as false advertising because the photo of the beautiful frosting in her book is not the same frosting of the actual recipe! I have tried her frosting recipe over and over and it comes out a clumpy soupy hot mess every time. (Keep in mind that I am a vegan chef that loves to bake and create innovative frostings.)  I wish I could not only get my money back for this overpriced book, (due to the inaccuracy of the recipes) but also, I want my money back for the EXPENSIVE INGREDIENTS it took to make this hot mess!  I won't even touch on the other recipes besides frostings, I think I've said enough.  The pictures are gorgeous, but do not reflect the actual recipes.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|Why?  I didn't have high hopes for this movie but I went to see it anyway and I really feel like they didn't even try.  Slap on a couple of celebrity names and you can get away with anything these days it seems.  There is no need to buy a dvd for a movie that will disappoint,  DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I would glady sacrifice my battery life for this cool app!!! That is, if it were a live wallpaper. even though it's the free app of the day and nice to play with....I can't see myself passing with it any longer than 2 mins. I'm sure a lot went into this app but I think it would be cooler if it were a live wallpaper
B006E4QCXU|5.0|pretty cool how you can set the forces to attract or repel. big bang got nothin on this app. word.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|Oh boy, dots flying around using math... and that's it. This is seriously lame, and not even having the option to set it as a live wallpaper? What a waste of time. Runs like crap on a 1.2 GHz phone... I've seen 8-year-olds program better than this.

B004YW4L5K|5.0|Reading American Gods is like traveling down a long, meandering river. You're not sure where this river is going, but the journey is beautiful, the scenery is sublime, and you don't ever want it to end.<br /><br />The gods are not dead. But in America they are no longer all powerful. Perhaps they never were all powerful, but they would have you believe that they were. Wave after wave of people came to America. Wave after wave of gods came along for the ride, traveling in the heads of countless number of immigrants. Now in twenty-first century America, the old gods that you're familiar with, the gods you may not be familiar with from less culturally successful imperialistic societies, and the new gods of science and technology all commingle uneasily. Bereft of belief, they grow less powerful and at the same time they grow proportionally more desperate to retain their existence.<br /><br />And so we meet the protagonist of this story, a man named Shadow. Through his eyes we are taken into a journey across America. While traveling with him, we discover just what the state of those American gods really is and we also discover a/the soul of America. To write more about the specifics of the story would ruin it. Part of the joy of the story is the discovery.<br /><br />But just like that, the journey ends. Sadly. Would that were more because the America that Neil Gaiman writes about is a beautiful land, a land that I wish I could continue to meander through.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|Growing up in the original Star Wars era, I found the Clone Wars very entertaining.  There is not many shows you can watch with your 6 year old that keep you entertained.  The violence there, but the gore it not.  I mean, the violence is tasteful if you will but not over the top and too much for kids.  I'm sure they get see worse at school

B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|Yes I bought the hundred game pack for $10.  Money well spent.  I could easily spend that much in quarters in a single afternoon when I was a kid playing Tempest and Battlezone.  The Atari 2600 games are good for that Saturday morning, snowed in nostalgia but I don't spend much time there.  The coin op games were always superior in every way.  Williams, Bally, Cameco, Midway, and Nintendo need to come out with similar game packages containing Defender, Stargate, Phoenix, Galaxians, Gorf, Donkey Kong and the usual suspects.  Such a great idea!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This product is exactly what I wanted. It is light weight. Has a flap that comes over when I am not using it to protect the glass. I feel safer using my kindle now that I have this. I had my kindle fire like 3 weeks before I got this and it seemed so fragile w/o it.
B0009QZ4CE|5.0|I could have done without the two bonus tracks. I'd have prefered the original LP, but these days people feel cheated if a CD is less than 70 minutes long. It's quality, people; not quantity.  The remaster is excellant, unlike one or two other VDG/G/PH CD's (can you say 'acronym'). Basically what this issue accomplishes is a modern version of the original, which IMHO is the band's masterpiece: the only album which is consistently great from start to end. The neglected 'Arrow' remains my fave VDGG song, tied with 'Refugees'. 'Scorched Earth' and 'Undercover Man' are magnificent, which you might have realised if you'd heard them on 'Real Time' or 'Paradiso'.  This is a stunning thing. An 'old' prog band re-emerging with a devestating musical statement which pre-empted punk (PH's 'Nadir's Big Chance' was the same year). VDGG always ignored musical trends, and thereby contributed to the creation of new ones.  This, to my mind, is their desert island disc.  Loop
B006TJXZ30|4.0|A good email app for the kindle fire.  A little disappointed that this app does not contain access to my hotmail calendar.  That would make this product a 5 star.  Still not disappointed in this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a good good game it make me fell lucky and happy I really a fun game the is the best game on. my tablet
B001FB55H6|1.0|Hard to make a movie where superheroes suck. I don't know how they did it. Watched it in theaters and will NEVER attempt watching it again. It's just BAD!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I drive 2 hours each day to work and can listen the whole way. Just to read a chapter a day is nice too. It's a great app.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Over the last few days the free apps of the day have been very lame. This one makes up for them. It's very cool to play with and while it's mindless fun you continue to play with it.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is a pretty individual app. I cant find anything like it. I feel like I rule the universe. btw, your stories are getting worse and worse superman. way to ruin a great app.
0307593312|1.0|I just finished 1Q84 and was so happy to get to the end. I actually stopped reading for several days maybe 120 pages in, determined to not read this book, but I picked it up again out of curiosity. Yes, I wanted to see what would happen with the plot (I'm a plot junky.) But the short answer is nothing happens (except a virgin birth). Hundreds of pages of stalling.  Perhaps it's a tale of Mary and Joseph, except the happy couple take a taxi and stay at a nice hotel.   It's obvious from the start that the  book is nothing like the Girl with the Dragon tattoo books (which I had read somewhere). It is more literary (but not in a good way). I don't know if it's the translation, but I thought the quality of the prose was far below what I was expecting, given the book's literary pretensions.  More important, there is nothing feminist about this book. The women are not people; they are archetypes, mostly identified by their age and breast size. I could say the women are two dimensional, but so are the men--just less two dimensional. The main female character obsesses about the fact that her breasts are small and different sizes. When she's not sure she is herself, she feels her own breasts to see if she's changed. I can't imagine anyone letting this go if it was the male character feeling his testicles to find out if he's still himself.  In the last couple hundred pages, the main female character thought the same thought over and over and the narrator otherwise focuses on what clothes she is wearing and why. Meanwhile, what's the  male character wearing? We might read about his jacket once, but we are not told about his pants, shirt, and socks 40 or 50 times. He basically doesn't think about anything except sex he's had in the recent past and sex his mother had in the distant past.  Sex scenes can only be described as creepy. And everybody in the book either denies having had sex when they obviously did or denies remembering having had it or having been an agent in the matter.  I'm so glad it's over. I'm going to take a long hot shower and put on my favorite pants and tee. Oh, no! I'm thinking about clothes...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it was the best game I have ever played . i love the the graphics there very very good. I love it.
B004I744AS|5.0|it not only showed the definition but also offered up picture. Thesaurus, and even sound. you can also do like type searches.... impressive....
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|The opening music is awesome.  The film is worthy of the Oscar. Paris is a wonderland.  I am ready to go there tonight.  Around midnight!!
B005ZUR724|5.0|With the game now running on my Kindle Fire, I am happy to say that this is the closest to vanilla WoW that I have run across. Most definite a must have for those who love Warcraft as much as I do. Plenty of quests and a decent PvP. All the classes are well rounded, although I find that the mage is a little under powered early in the game but it doesn't take long to become a force to be reckoned with.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|[[ASIN:B000JQU1VS The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]I love Sherlock Holmes mystery books. but I really like reading them better on my new Kindle Touch.  The print is perfect and the pages turn so easy that one can get lost in the mystery and not have to worry about pages that turn themselves, especially in a new book.  The price for this book was $0.00.  Can't beat that!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome these people need to stop being mean and sag this game is not stupid just my opion
1400052181|5.0|Amazing story!  As a retired RN, I recall HeLa cells in my bio classes.  Little did I imagine that 30 yrs later, I'd be reading about them for my Book club.  This book has everything:  scientific matter, human emotion, love, anger, hate & most of all a great story that catches you from page one!  An interesting  cast of characters:  Deborah was my favorite, along with Sonny, Lawrence et al.  Good grief, how much could this woman (Deborah) stand in her life?  What a trooper!  There are very few books I have read that can combine science with fiction.  Couldn't put it down.  As someone who has given parts of self (lungs) , I wonder if they have been used for the advance of science (I certainly hope so).  The ethical question is very humaniizing, especially  if you have donated a part to science (even if you haven't given consent).  Recommend this book entirely!

B004V2AWKG|5.0|I love this book.  When I was teaching, my students were made to read this.  They were in 7th grade, and didn't understand the significance of a utopian society.  How could they?  They don't have the tools to understand something so deep.  However, reading this book as an adult was amazing.  I started looking around the world and looking at things in a whole new light.  Today we live in a world that is being made more and more centerist, one in which everyone has the same things, same opportunities, etc.  Like the world Lois Lowry creates, we are losing history and it's a very small group that still remembers and studies what life was like.  Which direction are we headed?  Toward a utopian society where everyone and everything is the same or back to a world where diversity was the norm?

B006E4QCXU|1.0|This really has no point. Just a bunch of dots that respond to touch. Would be a better free app, don't really know why it costs so much.

Rooted, unlocked moto atrix with wetdream rom.
0743487486|2.0|This book is very disappointing, not because I don't agree with the author. Actually, I already agreed with most of the author's stands (on issues like punishment, praise, bribing kids, scolding kids, etc) before I started this book. If you are like me, who are already aware of the danger of giving conditional love to kids and want to learn more on what we parents can do to ensure unconditional love while still set reasonable limits with our children, this book is not for you.<br /><br />The most disappointing part of this book is that the author spent way too much time, at least three quarters of his book, to describe/argue/try to persuade you what is conditional parenting, why it is so bad, how so many parenting books teach you the wrong things, and how horrible the parenting trend it is today in America. I agree with most of his points, but even for me, he sounds just way too defensive, extreme, and emotional.<br /><br />As to the tiny part on unconditional parenting in this book, there is nothing really new or profound. All the author says is very common sense things, like \\"do not give too much Nos\\" or \\"limit criticism.\\" For example, on the issue of praise, I've read sooooo much better chapters in other parenting books, like \\"Just tell me what to say\\" or \\"Easy to love, difficult to discipline\\", or \\"Respectful parents, respectful kids.\\" I wasn't expecting this book to be a complete how-to guide, but even the theory part on unconditional parenting in this book is pretty weak too. Most of the research this author quotes in the book seem just to prove what he says is right, other than giving the readers a new and educational perspective of the issue. Both on how-to and theory, I've definitely read much much better and thought-provoking parenting books than this book.<br /><br />Also I agree with one of the top reviewers here, that a lot of what this author says, if applied without critical thinking, can be actually misleading and counterproductive, especially for very young toddlers. I agree with that reviewer that everyone has to learn to respect the authority to a certain degree in their lives. Say when a police car wants to pull you over, you do need to stop. This is not \\"blind obedience\\". There are similar situations when parents just have to be the authority of the house too, and the kids need to learn to respect that. It's not against unconditional love at all. I think the author's defensive/fighting mode in writing this book really undermined his effort of trying to promote good ideas. For example, is it really necessary to italicize a sentence like this in a parenting book--\\"The dominant problem with parenting in our society is not permissiveness, but the fear of permissiveness\\"?? I did not buy a sociology book for myself to read and I don't trust a non-sociologist to make a broad conclusion on our society like that either. From my own experience with other parents, all I have to say is, I guess if the author's statement is correct, where I live does not belong to American society! I have to say, half way into this book, the extreme/emotional tone of the author really started to annoy me.<br /><br />I've read/scanned about 10 to 15 parenting book so far. This is one of the rare ones that after reading I basically felt that I learned nothing at all. I think the book has good points, seriously, but I do not recommend this book as the first reading on parenting.<br /><br />Ironically, the other book that I read which also gave me a similar sense of disappointment is \\"parenting with love and logic.\\" I agree with the love and logic authors that children need to learn to choose and learn to be responsible for the result of their own choice, but as I went further into the book, their way of applying this principle really bothered me. Love and logic techniques are not named but openly disagreed and criticized by this author in the book. When I read this part, I started to feel that maybe I'm just an innocent reader who get caught in this hot opinion-fight between these so-called parenting experts.led parenting experts.
B004A8ZWW4|3.0|If you combine two of Sylvester Stallone's movies, \\"Over the Top\\" and \\"Rocky 1\\", and make robots the subject matter, you'll get \\"Real Steel\\". During the last fight scene I was tempted to shout out, \\"Rocky! Rocky!\\"
B000FCK42M|5.0|Amazon recommended \\"The Power of the Dog\\" after I had purchased \\"Beat the Reaper\\" by Josh Bazell. As soon as I began reading, I couldn't put it down. I didn't want it to end. This is the thriller/mystery book that I compare all others to. So far, nothing has left a bigger impression on me.  First, the elements of Italian mobsters and Mexican cartels immediately makes for a great story. Add in Winslow's writing style and suspense, and it's a recipe for a truly awesome book. The characters are well-developed, both the good guys and bad. I don't claim to be an expert on book reviews, I am just a person who enjoys a good thriller that grips you from the start.  I read every other Don Winslow book after this one, and he is absolutely my favorite author. But this book is the best of them all. I highly recommend it to anyone like me, looking for a captivating book that you can't put down.

A compendium of flippant personal opinions that lack scholarly/clinical/statistical backing, and a smattering of personal anecdotes from the authors' lives is NOT what I need to guide me through one of the more important decisions I'll make in my life.<br /><br />Non-monogamy is hard work, especially for folks like us raised up in a society that is so biased toward monogamy... and so grossly misinformed about even the basics of non-monogamy. I actually have poly friends to look to for advice or as examples, but most folks don't. So most of us don't have anything to go on. And the thing is, even the most sincere, loving, caring, honest people can torpedo their relationship BY ACCIDENT, through totally innocent mistakes.

So many people have raved about The Ethical Slut, so I picked up a copy. I was LIVID before I could finish the first chapter, and I had to force myself to finish the rest of the book, just in case there was something--anything--of value amid the vapid, self-serving rubbish the authors present.<br /><br />Speaking of chapter one, the authors even fail at justifying the concept of rehabilitating the word slut... they themselves say that one of the primary attributes given to the word \\"slut\\" is that a slut is indiscriminate... and then they blather on a bunch of nonsense without ever sorting that one *little* issue out. The word is not salvageable, ESPECIALLY in regards to the concept of relationship ethics (which they repeatedly claim is a prime focus of their book), because indiscriminate behavior is utterly counter to ethical relationship behavior. I won't harp on it any more but I will tell you that an opening chapter that is complete HOOEY did not leave me anticipating the remaining chapters.

B003VANOFY|5.0|Okay so up until buying this headset I was using my Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones along with a stand-based mic. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my Bose headphones. But they are better suited for listening to music and for travel purposes (Because of the carry case, noise cancelling, and light/compact design.<br /><br />However I was finding that playing Starcraft II and other games difficult without a proper gaming headset. So I started looking around and eventually came across these. They work PERFECTLY!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Comfortable - I have worn the G930 headset for a 5 hour gaming session without any discomfort. If adjusted to fit your head, they will be comfortable.<br /><br />2. Programmable GKeys - At first I thought I wouldn't ever use them, but they are very handy. I programmed my keys to a) Voice Change on Press , b) Push to Talk in Vent , c) Mute Vent. The headset integrates seamlessly with ventrilo. That means I can talk over vent without having to be at my keyboard. Maybe I walked away to get a snack and still want to hear the conversation and respond. This headset works at a fairly far distance.<br /><br />3. Wireless - I absolutely had to have a wireless headset. You can also charge it via a USB cable while using it if the battery is getting low mid-game.<br /><br />4. Low battery warning - A noise plays in the headset to let you know the battery has about an hour left of life.<br /><br />5. Mic - Crystal clear. My brother immediately noticed I was using a new mic. Everyone can hear me more clearly.<br /><br />6. Voice changing software included - Using your Gkeys you can change your voice to a variety of silly things. I've found that the space squirrel voice is the funniest.<br /><br />7. Solid - Built to last. This set has a solid feel and is solidly designed.<br /><br />8. Charging USB cable - This is included for when the battery gets low. This cable is VERY long and has a neat storage device. So even when you are tied down by a cable charging it back up, at least the cable is very long and gives you as much movement freedom as possible.<br /><br />9. Battery life - Right out of the box on first time use I got around 5 hours of life out of this set (It wasn't fully charged). On full charge I can get around 10 hours of battery life. Plenty of time. And even if the battery does get low, remember the extra long USB charging cable.<br /><br />10. Sound Isolation - Not perfect or as good as my Bose, but it is good enough. I can still make out loud noises in the background when the headphones aren't playing music/game sounds/etc. But they are muffled sounds. So this headset does a decent job of isolating background noise.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Voice changing selection - Some of the voice changing selections are very difficult to understand. It morphs the voice so much the words come out unclear.<br /><br />2. Price - These were somewhat expensive for a headset (Around $150). But so far I find the price was worth it.<br /><br />I would recommend this headset to anyone that wants a solid gaming/general purpose headset.m as possible.  9.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Time travel seems to be a popular motif in literature of late. It's a premise that seems hard to swallow at first, but King has used it very skillfully to create both a compelling plot-line and an intriguing look (about whose accuracy I have no idea) at the character of Oswald and the nature of his married life, while including ancillary characters surrounding the Kennedy assassination with whom I was previously unfamiliar.  Originally bought this book as a good 'airline read', but found it to be much, much better than that. If you enjoyed \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" (which I certainly did), you'll find this book quite different. Sometimes the prose seems too 'cutesy', but taken as a whole, the narrative really works well. It lacks the touching characters of TTW, but makes up for that with its journey into the bowels of a time in history which remains unforgettable for anyone who lived through it.  A very good read.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is simple, but gorgeous to lose yourself in...like when you're contemplating the universe, or just trying to work something out in your head. Like doodling in space...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is the ad free version of angry birds. this is the old fashioned version of the angry birds series. it is s huge and partially difficult game. if you have played angry birds before or this is the first time, you'll love it
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I started by reading the sample. Before my sample was over, i was hooked. For the next few days i read at every chance i could find. The story draws u in and holds u tightly till the end. And beyond...
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|this game is just the original angry birds seasons other then the Chinese new year section. the Chinese new year level is great but small. you shouldn't spend any money on it.

B005K2XP6Y|5.0|This cover is almost perfect.  Kindle Fire fits perfectly - nice and snug, but not too tight.  Very well made.  No smell like some reviewers had mentioned.  The only thing this product needs is a small hole in the side, so the Kindle could be charged while in the case.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|The first Movie was bad and I saw the sequel in theater and it was even worst, not worth the money, at all.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|This app is cool for about 2 minutes. Then you're already bored of it. Sure you can stretch that to 3 minutes if you play with the color setting and reverse \\"attract\\" to \\"repel\\". Good thing this was the FAOTD or I'd have buyer's remorse.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Simply the best voice of our generation, apologies to some really great ones.  listen in wonder, grasshopper, it doesn't get any better than her.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app.  works beautifully.  plenty of options.  lots of resources.  great reading plans.  has all the versions I need.  highly recommend it.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|this product is very nice, and allows me to use Kindle without looking to tech heavy. the cover really does look like a old book and therefore less in your face for those who dont want to be noticed as using an ereader
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Whenever you want to switch between settings and colors in the menus, you have to exit the app entirely, then reload it. I've tried changing options from the app everyway possible, but the only way it works on the kindle fire is to leave the app. If this was fixed, I'd give it 5*. Great app otherwise, so 4*
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very addictive game. Once you pick it up you can't put it down. One of the best yet I've put on my kindle Fire. Try it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I've put this game on every Android device I own. It's just that addictive. Even after playing through the boxes it's fun to go back and shoot for all perfects. Very smart and fun game.
0061992860|5.0|I bought this to add to my bug-out bag. I was mainly looking for a basic survival book that covers the basics of all essentials. this book accomplishes that. it covers the basics on edible plants and how to check if the plant is safe to eat, covers basic snaring techniques, as well as water collection and consumption.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this application has all the answers.  it has a great daily read feature so its easy to cut into the daily life schedule.
145551389X|5.0|If you would like hundreds of pages of simply GaGa than this is the book for you.  It has pictures I've never seen before and I'm a huge GaGa fan.  It has wardrobe pictures, set pictures from her Tour, personal pictures; everything and anything.  I would have liked to see a few words on some pages, maybe captions would have made this STELLAR, but for a picture book and a GaGa fan, this is a must have!
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|This movie was difficult to make it through.  The lead character was dull and pouty when he wasn't killing someone in an over the top manner.  The music was awful. The violence was repugnant.  It was fun to watch Albert Brooks chew up and steal every scene he was in.  The rest...I wish I had that part of my evening to \\"do-over.\\"
B005NFVZTM|4.0|I went into X-Men: First Class with lowered expectations after how the 3rd movie wrapped up the original trilogy of films.  I avoided the Wolverine movie after hearing terrible things from critics and friends alike.  I heard mostly good things about First Class, so decided to give it a go.  The prequel does a great job of giving Magneto some depth and a good back story.  Seeing his powers blossom is an added bonus.  The background of \\"Professor X\\" and Mystique is a little different than what I had read in other tellings, but it was an interesting take.  Kevin Bacon does a good job as the villain of the movie and the supporting cast is good as well.  The CGI and sets are top notch.  One thing that this X-Men movie has going for it is the fact the characters are not in dated super hero gear nor are they in over the top futuristic getup that is over the top and annoying to look at.  9/10 super hero movies tend to go too far with trying to push the costumes of each villain or hero (I'm looking at you, Joel Schumacher Batman).  The one knock I have on this movie is that like all the other X-Men movies, it tries to cram too much into the movie.  The Beast side-story is unnecessary are distracting at best.  Overall it's a good story with good background and a great set of characters being portrayed by good actors and actresses.  Definitely worth a viewing.  4/5 stars.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|The product itself is okay - it served it's purpose to jazz up my smartphone amplifier.  But after two months, it does not work properly any more and I do not get any support.  Two weeks ago, I would have given the product a 3-4 star rating but now that it stopped working ... it's barely worth  1 star.
0316010669|4.0|Having read Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point a few years back, I decided to read his followup Blink.  The main premise behind Blink is that sometimes we don't need all the information in the world to make a correct, quick and informed decision.  Our brain processes enough of the information it needs to make a snap decision which most of the time turns out to be a better idea then weighing out too much data.  The old adage of \\"go with your gut\\" seems to be proven by much of Gladwell's writing and reporting on other studies completed.  This does not always prove to be the case, however.  The \\"Pepsi Challenge\\" from the 1980s is a good example of this.  Whereas people might prefer the taste of Pepsi in a 2 oz cup in a blind taste test, it doesn't mean they will drop Coke altogether and switch to Pepsi.  The New Coke disaster of the 80s is an a testament to this.  Whereas Gladwell gives us both sides of the coin about whether to trust your gut or weigh out all available information before making a decision, he is inconclusive about which is better.  There is no real right or wrong answer, which is disappointing.  Nor anywhere in the book is it determined that there is a set of guidelines one should follow to say whether a first impression is the right impression.  The Tipping Point gave us closure and a conclusion.  Blink gives us ideas and beautifully presented studies which leaves us wanting more.  This lake of a final answer takes the book down a peg in this reviewer's humble opinion.  Blink is interesting and definitely worth a read.  Unfortunately it's not perfect.  4/5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game so much I am always playing it! there 119 games so no one can ever get bored!!
B004T4KQJS|1.0|LOL LOL LOL.  Just read the kindle sample.  LOL LOL LOL. So, in order for the evolutionists to get a universe from nothing, they must first change the definition of nothing into something.  Then they can comfortably talk about the nature of &#34;nothingness&#34;. LOL LOL.  This isn't science. LOL.  It reminds me of the story of the evolutionist tht told God, &#34;I can create life too.&#34;  God said, &#34;OK. Make a man.&#34; The evoultionist bent down and began forming some dirt into a pile.  God tapped the evolutionist on the shoulder and said, &#34;Hey!  Get your own dirt!&#34;  This book is just another example of the evolutonists waxing irrational and absurd.  LOL LOL.  Hey Lawrence, get your own dirt!  Or, come on, at least admit that it is dirt.  LOL.  The star is for the humor content. LOL LOL  LOL LOL LOL
B006E4QCXU|5.0|so adficting. once, I got it to look like a tree, and then a bird. I wouldn't pay 2$ for this (I'm glad I got it free) but I would definately pay a buck. totally recommend it anyway
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love everything about it. keeps me on my mark and easily accessible.  I'm not sure if it reads passages out loud but if not that would be the only thing to add.
B00003CX9E|1.0|Not for $32. That's a rip off. Great movie, but don't buy it. Just wait for it on TCM for free. No movie is worth $32. I can't believe this list price.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis portray characters that are timeless. The movie is an inspiration to the young to pursue their dreams. Before they know it, they will be writing reviews of movies like I am, lol.
B006MQRLSA|3.0|I love baseball movies, especially movies that follow true stories like Moneyball did. I enjoyed the story, as someone who lived in Oakland during this era, it was both nostalgic and enlightening. The faults lie in the performance that Brad Pitt gives. He eats pretty much the whole way through the entire film (as he tends to do in movies) and it's disgusting. It's hard to watch a scene when he's there chomping like a horse with a carrot. It's very distracting unless the sight of people eating with their mouthes open doesn't bother you. That being said, Pitt does have moment when you can see the decent actor in him shining through. There were moments of comedy and moments that were touching but more than anything, for a baseball fan, this movie can take you back to a moment in time when baseball changed for the underdogs. It'd give this movie 4 stars if it weren't for the chomping.
0312611692|2.0|The deadline was met. However, I received my book with three cuts on the cover, apparently caused by a stiletto. How about receiving a damaged product? Would you feel satisfied?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|if you rate this game after you get it, you can get extra game cash! The game sushi is really fun but really hard to get at first...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green, the author of The Fault in Our Stars, does not romanticize the experience of having cancer as many books do-he approaches it with a realistic attitude though his characters, and makes it relatable for anyone. But what Green really does wonderfully is examine the quirky, beautiful, terrible, and over all enigmatic hearts of humans. He is able to make people recognize the amazing truths of what our hearts contain, all while telling a story; a story about a girl with cancer and a boy with a prosthetic leg who fall in love, with America's Next Top Model, a story of a tulipman, champagne, certain half-deserted streets, blind-guy video games, a completely mad and yet unbelievably wise old writer, and a very important notebook thrown in as well. And it turns out that all these things, when put together, create a wonderful novel.  DFTBA.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|the update is awesome works real good get it get get it! best game with update ever I love the dragon thing.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this game is just very cool in the way it looks and how you can change the Colorado depending on speed, if toy have not watched the video demo in the photos section watch it!
B006Y5EMHM|5.0|Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />When I saw the promo for this show, I though, \\"A TV version of the film Chicago,\\" but as I continued watching, I saw that it's more than that. It's Singin' In The Rain meets All About Eve coupled with a unique prespective on show business. Plus, it stars Debra Messing, Katherine McPhee (who is extradorinarily beautiful and has a lovely voice), Jack Davenport (Commadore Norrington in the Pirates Of The Carribean movies) and Academy Award winner Angelica Huston. Besides, Mr. Spielberg himself is behind this drama (he's an executive producer) and THAT, my friends, sealed the deal for me. Anything that has Mr. Spielberg has his name on (with the exception of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Super 8 and the Transformers films, having had to sit through the abominable first installment) I'm willing to give a shot. I recommend this series.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Amazingly addictive and soothing. I recommend this to any therapy patients like myself. Love it on Kindle Fire. Moving stars around is much more fun than it looks.
B00004W50T|5.0|As so many have said, in so many great ways, this is a very special album.<br />I'm adding my five stars, but also wanted to point out just how great the bonus tracks are.<br />You know how sometimes you'll get a remastered album with bonus tracks that just ruin the flow of the album and you have to leap out of your seat before an alternate version of a song shatters the moment? Not here. Well, there are a couple of alternate takes, but they don't detract or bore; quite the contrary, and one of the 'Alternate Takes' is a version of 'Lonesome Suzie' played very differently in a swinging style that is fresh and entertaining to the ears.<br /> I always happily anticipate the extra tracks because there is nearly another album's worth of great music!<br />So, especially rewarding when considering the considerable work that is 'Music From Big Pink' on its own.
B0043URV5U|4.0|I bought this collection of Bob Seger hits for my fiance for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!  First CD is better than the second but it's packed with all his greatest, well known and well loved hits.  A must for any Seger fan!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|HOW DO YOU SAVE THE CREATIONS!?!?!!?!?!! THERE IS NO WAY TO SAVE THEM?!!! WITH HE KF!!!!!!  I am so glad that FAoTD is finally good this time! I love how you can move your own galaxy,  and it's relaxing!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|The movie of course was in excellent condition. I received the DVD promptly and it was packaged nicely. The first movie however was very dark and could not be viewed so I had to order another one, I was credited promptly abut did not have an option on the screen to have another one reshipped. I figured that would happen so I had the first DVD picked up by ups, which also was very promptly an problems. I had ordered another DVD of the same movie the day I told Amazon of this DVD defectiveness and it came the day after ups picked up the first movie.
B005SAV9SO|3.0|Note: I just saw this film with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This is an interesting film, with at least one funny line and plenty of raunchy material. The story is intriguing, but it lacks a clear resolution to the sub-plot of the kid who loves a girl, and it also lacks heart, especially Ms. Diaz' character actually changing through the course of the film from an insensitive, f-bomb teacher to someone who genuinely cares about her students, much like her her rival in the film. Unfortunately, God's name is profaned again. (Why do actors feel that throwing around the Lord's name in vain is funny?) Should have been rated PG-13.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|this is great for messin around with when you're bored, i love the different colors you can put into it and the shapes you can come up with. Although i do think you should be able to take a picture of a design you make or a video of how you manipulate it, it would make it even better and more worth it.  All in all great for killing time :-) I'll be keeping it but still hoping they upgrade it to save pics and/or videos.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Missile defender snagged maybe an hour as I worked through 27 levels before giving up. The rewards and upgrades are fairly well matched so that rewards successful defense of your buildings not just good enough defense. Worth playing!

0061743526|5.0|October 22, 2011  Without exaggeration, this must be my 20th reading of this classic of American Literature. It never fails to move me and inspire me and educate me. I find something \\"new\\" - or at least new to me - virtually every time I read it.  This time I paid closer attention to some of the minor characters, especially the women - Calpurnia, Aunt Alexandra, Helen Robinson, Mrs Merriweather, Lula, Miss Maudie, Mrs Dubose, Miss Caroline, and Mayella Ewell. I was struck by what a wide range of personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and ethics Lee was able to express using just these minor characters (some appearing for only a page or two) living in a small town.  Many people feel this is a book about racism. I don't think that is the core theme of this book, though it is the central plot device Lee uses. I think the major theme of the book is personal integrity and courage - doing what you know is right when all about you seemingly disagree and even when it may be dangerous to do so, being true to your own moral compass, and instilling those values in your children by example not just words.  In 2010 I listened to the audio book, performed by Academy-Award-winning actress Sissy Spacek. She does an admirable job, though her accent is wrong. She is a Texan, and the Southern Alabama accent is softer than her twang. Still, by the 2nd disc I had stopped noticing this, and allowed myself to be carried into the story by her expert reading.
0007274939|4.0|was just disappointed that it took so long to get to me, which you can't really expect more, but if i knew that before hand......like the book and it was described the way it was.
B0068TL23G|5.0|I absolutely love this game.. and the UI is fantastic if you use a soft tipped stylus when playing it.. very quick reaction, and the route of your lines is much cleaner!  For those who are saying it is too short.. you're kidding, right?  there are 144 of these great little puzzles!  The one and two star solutions are a cinch, but challenging when you set your goal on getting the five star solution without using the cheats!  This developer deserves a hand!  Well worth the price if you didn't happen to grab it on the \\"free\\" app of the day!
0312641893|3.0|Cinder is an occasionally ingenious re-imagining of the familiar Cinderella story.  The setting -- New Beijing 123 years after World War IV -- is unapologetically sci-fi and the eponymous heroine is a cyborg with a mysterious past.  Sounds like a fun read, yes?  Er, not so much.  MINOR SPOILERS TO FOLLOW.  The plot is predictable.  Cinder's true identity becomes blindingly oblivious on page 44, making the big reveal at the end the epitome of anticlimax.  The author has cheerfully chucked logic out the window.  Despite a deadly plague running rampant through the city, the entire population is invited to a ball.  Sorry, but I find it difficult to believe that Prince Kaito would risk his life by welcoming the unwashed masses into his palace.  Actually, the entire plague subplot is badly handled.  Cinder repeatedly breaks quarantine.  Okay, she' subjected to a blood test minutes after being exposed and pronounced \\"clean\\", but if that's their idea of infectious disease protocol, no wonder the plague is out of control.  Then again, this is a fairytale, not a manual from the CDC, so maybe I should cut Marissa Meyer some slack.  After all, she is very good at tweaking aspects of the traditional story.  For example, instead of a glass slipper, Cinder has a too-small mechanical foot.  I really liked Cinder.  As a cyborg, she's literally a non-person, but she doesn't need a fairy godmother to smooth her way.  Unfortunately, the author chose to infect both Cinder and the prince with insta-love.  After just one brief meeting, Cinder runs in and out of the palace unannounced, yet somehow Kaito always has time for her.  I just didn't buy their romance.  Cinder is the first of four volumes in the Lunar Chronicles.  While it's a clever enough conceit to fuel one book, I think the novelty would quickly wear thin and I feel no urge to stick around to see if Cinder and her prince live happily ever after.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app with the audio read alone features its great. and the verities of version give many ways to read the bible
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I like because you can play all kinds of games. I am always so excited when I play it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is useful if you do not know where to start reading the Bible. It is also good to keep on track reading God's word every day. I love the translation part so you can look at what different translations say at the touch of your fingertips. It's compact and handy for on the go.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|love the game but wheres the update? ive emailed, searched &amp; posted for over a week now &amp; NO ONE has an answer....
B0059XTTXC|5.0|I think When It comes to old style movies like this, the 70's spy type. You have to keep a few things in mind.<br />1. Movies are NOT made like this anymore, movies that pace with Incredible acting!<br />2. What's most Important, realize what you are going to see, and have (In My Opinion) what has been lost with great films of this caliber....PATIENCE!  This is My Favorite of 2011.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Cool, but this normally costs $2? Fine for free but definitely not worth paying for. Get it when it comes up as a free app but do not waste your money otherwise.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I literally couldn't put the book down.. I recommend it for all ages, now that I have finished the first I am jumping right into the next.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie was not for me at all, a complete waste of time. This will most likely be used as a door stop.
075695195X|5.0|The Bartimaeus Trilogy remains one of my all-time favorite trilogies, primarily because the first-person narration of Bartimaeus is so gosh-darned hilarious. Character-wise, Bartimaeus's voice is so strong and his whole character so vividly fleshed out that he sounds more like a living, breathing person than a character from a book. Okay, I know that makes me sound like a really creepy nerd, but I promise you that you will fall in love with Bartimaeus about two pages into the book.  The plot of the novel is fast-paced and filled with enough twists to keep the pages turning. Even though from the description it might sound like a Harry Potter rip-off, Stroud's take on a magical world steers in a whole different direction and keeps the magic fresh. Towards the end, when the villain finally revealed his plans, it was such a delicious thrill to see how the characters worked within the rules and boundaries of the world that Stroud has created.  The only negative part about this novel is Nathaniel's chapters and his background story. I felt like his whole \\"feud\\" with Lovelace was such a thinly-veiled plot device. The scene where he first met Lovelace in the house and was shamed by him wasn't very convincing and if anything, only made me dislike Nathaniel as a character. Don't get me wrong, I like flawed characters, but Nathaniel's not so much as flawed as two-dimensional. As a character, I found his voice to be really weak and his chapters didn't flow nearly as smoothly as Bartimaeus's did. Also, at times I reaaaaaally wanted to spank him.  Despite that, I am still giving this book 5 stars because overall I enjoyed myself hugely while reading it and I was very sorry when it ended. There are few characters out there with Bartimaeus's fire and wit (I would rate his humor right up there with the best of Discworld characters) and it would be a shame for readers to miss it. Buy this book and read it now!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Works great on Transformer.  But I will probaby never launch it again aside from the initial playing today.  However, if this were available as live wallpaper then I'd definitey use it and get visual enertainment from it on a daily basis.  I'd even pay for a live wallpaper version, whereas this version is only good for a free download as faotd.
B00007BKVC|5.0|This is my all time very favorite movie, and I own 3 copies. One in a TAPE, and two in DVD. I got it memorized. I love the special effects whereby, susan and geena narrate the movie as it plays scene by scene, w/ Callie Khouri, who wrote and produced this movie and now writes ABC's &#34;NASHVILLE&#34; drama.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun! ! ! ! and it runs good on the kindle fire really recommend this app to everyone who likes games to kill time on a daily basis -
159562015X|5.0|I am a Job Placement Director for a college and ordered this book for my team of 6. I told them to have the test done in one week and we would have a training on our strengths. Everyone shared their strenghts and you could tell that this was a real boost in their confidence. I discussed the results in our Director's meeting and the college President ordered a book for all of the directors. I did this test in 2006 and it has directly effected the way I am a leader, in a very positive.
1401223176|5.0|Came in excellent condition and this is a great comic and story line! Drawn by Jim Lee which is an amazing artist, and the story line is gritty and exciting.. It has all the comics of this series all in one book.. A must to have if you are a batman fan!
B005HSL626|1.0|Terrible, impossible to explode the bomb. Ads are super annoying!! Pay for the ad free version, or better yet, don't get it at all!!!!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|The amazing stillness of the main characters - both Gosling and Mulligan give this movie its depth and its strength. There isn't much said and yet each action and look speaks volumes. This is a character driven movie and what action there is is used to define those characters, including bursts of unimaginable violence. Five stars. My only complaint would be the soundtrack which so many loved and yet I found strangely out of place - a retro Eighties, including the titles packaged with a very modern movie.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is a very fun little app. At first I didn't really think it was going to be all that cool. But after wasting 20 minutes with it and not realizing the amount of time that had gone by,I would have say this is freaking awesome, especially for free today. However I can understand paying for this on a different day. Glad I picked it up while it was free. Plating with gravity is cool and relaxing.
B001F6TXME|4.0|This is a huge improvement over the line of sight wireless remotes Nikon makes. I still think they should be able to make this device with a little wireless piece that plugs into the camera. But it works well and feels build solid.
B006QPVH6O|2.0|Remember the Blair Witch Project...well they reminded me of it.  Your really didn't much of the aliens but you kinda of know they'er out there.  I bought the movie cheap (thank God) but have no interest in sharing it with family and friends.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|This seems pretty boring but is actually mesmerizing once you start. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I just downloaded it and I don't know how long it can be entertaining for. If it proves to be long term fun it will definitely get a 5th star.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|It gets old pretty quick.... I will have my kids play with it to see if they like it better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|You should really get this game. It is so cool that you can play so many games in one app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are really fun and addictive. at first I thought this was going to be all a scam but they are really fun.
B0000C0F8W|5.0|Wow, listening to this on my amplifier, Maynard's voice just blows me away even more...Its as if he is here performing in my room...Rocks so hard...Listened to the entire album 3 times through on the vinyl because it sounds just that good...
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The movie loooked great for a cheap price. I gave it to my friend for christmas and she loveed it.
B000001EGE|5.0|This aptly entitled album is the first in a triplet of albums recorded at the \\"Honky Chateau\\" (Château d'H&eacute;rouville) in the Oise Valley, France, all three of which were Elton's first huge chart-toppers.  Notwithstanding the terrifying success of GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, the third in the trilogy and the one which is held up by critics as his own Sgt Pepper, the pinnacle of his success and the favorite of fans all over the world, I personally believe HONKY CHATEAU is the better album of the three (the second being DON'T SHOOT ME I'M ONLY THE PIANO PLAYER).  In many ways it establishes the duo of Elton and Bernie as the greatest pair of song writers since Lennon-McCartney, and it establishes Elton's fine quartet as one of the most talented bands to grace the musical landscape of the 70's.  This is the band which would usher Elton John to the height of his career, and which would firmly plant him in the seat of mega-stardom and true successor to The Beatles as one of the greatest performers in history.  The 50's had Elvis, the 60's had The Beatles, and without a doubt, Elton John was the King of rock and roll in the 70's.  He would be the last as well, before the offal of divergent amalgams of pop music turned the recording industry into a free-for-all with every subgenre one can possibly think up both branching off in different directions and diffusing into homogenous pabulum.  Many critics, both arm-chair and professional have said the 70's was rife with genre and subgenre and no cohesive direction for pop but one artist was indeed holding the middle road on a recognizable course that was the trail blazer for the growth of rock.  While many experiments we now hail as \\"Prog Rock\\" were technologically and artistically expanding the medium of rock, and R&B was infusing with rock and jazz into another form of entertainment at the local \\"Disco\\", and \\"California Rock\\" and \\"Southern Rock\\" were grabbing up huge chunks of radio real estate, Elton John and Bernie Taupin and bandmates were driving a familiar vehicle for us, a bus on which we all sat comfortably in awe of inspired lyrical wit and unparalleled musicianship.  ELTON JOHN, TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION, and MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER were a triplet of near Dylanesque fok-rock, hidden treasures for the illuminati that were spread around by word of mouth and greedily eaten like fruit from the tree of knowledge.  We who were illulminated, or so we thought, had already decided that Elton John was candidate most likely to succeed, it was almost an \\"Ah Duh!\\" and not to take away from the proficient lovability of The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, ELO, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and a handful of others whose stars were about to burst forth as well, all of them sat on thrones of their own making, but Elton John had a certain \\"?\\" (we call it the X Factor now) that appealed across every perceptible border.  You could be a diehard progressive rocker, a disco lover, country-rocker, or just a basic old-time rock-n-roller, if you listened to and loved music, Elton John was in your collection.<br /><br />The Chateau is a 300 year old Villa rife with history.  A building where Chopin once lived, in the valley where Van Gogh was buried, where a French film score composer built a recording studio, discovered by The Grateful Dead, and then became the environment for classics: Pink Floyd's Obscured By Clouds, Cat Stevens' Catch Bull At Four, T-Rex's The Slider (all recorded in the same year as this album), and would be utilized in the future by David Bowie, Bad Company, The Bee Gees, Fleetwood Mac and others.  To say the least, it was a very magical place, and the fact that it produced all three of Elton's \\"masterpieces\\" (additionally, I will argue that CAPTAIN FANTASTIC AND THE BROWN DIRT COWBOY belongs in that category) just verifies that statement.  The product of those recordings was utterly fantastic, and the songs that resulted in HONKY CHATEAU are nothing short of perfection.  The recording sessions were so pristinely perfect that only one recording could be lifted from the sessions as a bonus track to this remastered CD, an obviously erroneous choice of fast electric version of Slave, which was wisely slowed down and slide into the retinue of antebellum folk.<br /><br />Amy, Suzie, Mellow, and Slave, all positively drip of Leon Russell influence and with hindsight, after the hugely beautiful release of THE UNION by Elton and Leon, they demonstrate the true appreciation which Elton had for his idol.  Amy in particular is an esoteric work of wonder, accented with solos by electric violin virtuoso Jean-Luc Ponty, the song is an impressionist painting splashed with living colors and surrealistic melody.  Honky Cat and Hercules are pure entertainment, the latter being my favorite Elton song.  Both are jaunty and uplifting tongue-in-cheek stories, the former a Nawlin's influenced piano and brass funk that quickly hopped into the top 10 billboards, and the latter is the definition of Elton's mastery at making something old new again.  Hercules fuses 50's doo-wop into 60's Beach Boys harmonies, and it all is enveloped in a richly warm wall-of-sound atmosphere that ends up being pure genius.  The other jaunty joke song is the now politically incorrect I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself, dated to be sure, but still humorous (at least to boomers) lament on teenage suicide.  I won't even speak to Rocket Man, it has become a part of our culture and any critique on it would just fall flat and on deaf ears.  Let's just call it the perfectly arranged song for a voyage into billboard top 10 orbit and into the subculture of the generation who adored it.  The other boomer favorite on this masterwork is Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters, lyrically, poetically, and instrumentally another ballad that can only called \\"perfect\\".  Crowds at concerts sing along word for word with Elton when he performs it, it has become an anthem of sorts to the emergency workers in the post-911 efforts at the World Trade Center, and it defies categorization as an anthem in general for New York City.  In one take, Elton turned Bernie's lyrics into a flawless diamond.  The song also confirms the perfection of unity between Elton and Bernie and the band which were able to generate such a critically fantastic album in such a short session with literally no throwaways.<br /><br />A word to the remastering of this album.  The words \\"pristine\\" and \\"perfect\\" come easily to mind.  There is no over the top loudness, every nuance and original acoustic vibration is captured in a butterfly net and gently delivered to your ears without a misstep or a warble.  Headphones are amazing, car stereo (especially Boston Acoustics) simply uncanny, and home stereo is an audiophiles dream.<br /><br />I recommend every studio album from Empty Sky to Captain Fantastic (1969-1975), then after a fallow period The One (1992) is a nice resurrection, but The Union (2010) with Leon Russell is really his next \\"masterpiece\\" after '75.

B006E4QCXU|5.0|Even after reading reviews and watching video there was still a delighted giggle when I 1st tried this app.  I also see it coming in handy when I baby sit my 2 yo nephew who loves to play on my kindle.  It's so easy to use yet cool to watch.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it rocked the world!!!!  I loved it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is bored. It was awesome.  EPIC!!!!!!!!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This movie is subtle action, emotion and struggle - kind of like real life.  If you are looking for non-stop action, go to the Fast and Furious series, Crank, Bourne series, etc.  Drive is one I recommend to my good friends.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good old fashion solitary....I definate recommend ,easy to download on the fire kindle.. the only con is that you do get pop outs ......

0312370830|1.0|This was a book club book I had been looking forward to reading.  The story and characters sounded compelling and I was interested to learn more about the Vel d' Hiv.  Unfortunately, it was poorly written, cliched, and superficial.  The novel alternates between two narratives: the story of Sarah, a young girl who escapes after being arrested in the Vel d' Hiv in Paris in 1942, and Julia, a journalist who investigates Sarah's story.  This is deeply disturbing material, but in the right hands it could have provided insight into the damaged physche of a nation.  Sarah's narrative at the beginning of the novel was thought-provoking, even if it was not very well-written.  Then, Sarah's narrative is dropped about half-way through the novel to pursue the narrative of Julia, an unlikeable and one-dimensional character.  There is also a pervasive anti-abortion message: abortion and the Holocaust are closely linked throughout the narrative.  The tragic and horiffic story of the Vel d' Hiv was used to create an emotional reaction in the reader, but the modern struggle over the atrocities of history was treated with very little insight.  It is emotionally manipulative to advance an anti-abortion message by appropriating the horror and sadness the reader feels when learning about the Holocaust.  These are both serious subjects, but were not treated with the thoughtfulness necessary to offer insight or create meaningful emotion.  It didn't help that the plot was poorly structured, the prose awkward and simplistic, and the characters never developed beyond one-dimensional stereotypes.  Althought this book deals with very serious themes, it is not a serious novel.
0062082353|5.0|This book is exactly what i was hoping for when i ordered it. Simply written, action-packed and fast-paced, it's hard to put down. I just wish it was longer.  The storyline is generally chronological and easy to follow, as Kyle talks about his time as a Navy Seal and sniper in the Middle East in a post-9/11 wartime environment. The chapters are separated into significant blocks of time, like deployments, and Kyle basically fills the pages taking about significant events or stories from those time periods. Each of these stories range in legth from a paragraph to a couple pages. Kyle mostly details the various patrols, battles, firefights and sniper missions that made up his deployments, with very little political talk or spin, which i liked. The only non-SEAL content of the book is the first part, which talks about his background and childhood, leading up to him entering the Navy, which is helpful in seeing what drives him and what may have helped him in training or his deployments.  Aside from his missions, Kyle talks about his joint operations/patrols with the Army and Marine Corps, some of his SEAL teammates, sniper training, equipment and psychological aspects of war and killing insurgents. There is enough detail in the book to make it very interesting.  I also liked that Kyle seemed like a down to earth guy for the most part, and you weren't overwhelmed by egotistical rants about how great SEALs are, like in some books. (If you know enough about them and understand their role and what they've accomplished over the years, its not hard to already have great respect for them, you dont need it pushed in your face, as it can take away from the stories)  There isnt much discussion about BUD/S training, but for those that have read even a few SEAL books, you'll already have seen that information. (If you want more detailed information about BUD/S specifically, try [[ASIN:0804118930 Class-29: The Making of U.S. Navy SEALs]], or [[ASIN:1400046955 The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228]] for something more current. If you're looking for post-BUD/S training info, try [[ASIN:0609810464 The Finishing School: Earning the Navy SEAL Trident]]. I found the lack of BUD/S talk one of the positive things about this book, as nearly every SEAL book seems to have at least 25% devoted to BUD/S, so it gets old and redundant after a while. However, the author does talk about post BUD/s and pre-deloyment related training, which is interesting.  He also doesn't get too much in the weeds on command structure or military procedures and processes. What few acronyms he uses, he explains in simple terms right away, which adds to the easy reading. You don't have to have much (or any) prior knowledge of the SEALs, Navy or military in general to enjoy this book.  One of the unique things about this book is that there are exerpts from Kyle's wife depicting her thoughts and feelings, hardships during deployments, raising her kids alone while Kyle was on deployment, etc. They offer a different perspective to compare against some of Kyle's thoughts.  If you enjoyed this book, you'll also like [[ASIN:031269945X SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper]], although i think this one was better. Wasdin's book has a little less action and more about BUD/S training, if i remember correctly.  Along with this book, i ordered [[ASIN:0316204315 Inside SEAL Team Six: My Life and Missions with America's Elite Warriors]], which im hoping is just as good or better.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is a pretty neat toy app, but if it could be set as the live wallpaper, it would be pretty awesome.
B005FVA3LK|5.0|Just wanted to throw my 2 cents into the mix!  I find this box set to be a awesome addition to any fans collection!  They did a very nice job in the packaging, and the book is very nice too, not to mention the 10 discs that you get for the price!  Hope you won't hesitate to purchase it before it disappears and the cost goes through the roof!  Enjoy, thanks
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Not one to write my thoughts on music , too personal . With Leonard's latest offering I must . Great emotional voice , wonderful back up singers and instrumental sections that are perfect . Amen is so good . If you can not give this 5* turn off you radio . As good as The Future that will always be a favourite . A legend still .
B004GYY714|5.0|Everyone love to listen radio, must have this apps, it has many different stations. Recommend to everyone! I could find some rare station by this app.
B003L77GG0|5.0|For the price it was amazing to receive something so cool.Whoa wow cool fantastic excellent dudes I am totally please for sure yall know.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is the only calander app I ever use. I honestly got it when amazon had for free months ago. I grabbed it and otherwise may have never find it. I always recommend it and would have paid the $5 it is now. It does everything the stock one should and the widget is amazing.  I keep the 4X4 widget up next to my home screen constantly to keep me up to date. I also have this on my tablet and it syncs between both devices great. Also dev is aamazing. Always updating it and making sure it works. It is running on my ICS Inspire 4G great. Thanks for wonderful app.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I was lucky not to buy this movie! to sum it up TWO words DULL, BORING, to say this movie is great and give it five stars then I would hate to see your movie collection. For those of you still on the fence about buying it then I suggest you rent or download it then you will see what i'm talking about.... this movie is nothing more than one big hype!!
B005T87QCI|5.0|its a great game but u guys need to add new bots cuz like the iphone version has twin city's black jac and they have sues and atom so get with the updating brow but its a great game
B002BWP49C|1.0|I only went to see the movie to make fun of it later. Good Lord, if not for the pervy old ladies sitting behind me doing their own Mystery Science Theatre 300, I woud have slept through it. Bella was not the least bit happy on her wedding day. I thought she was supposed to be over-the-moonin ove with Edward. Then, an eternity of pointless filler later, Jacob had become a pedophile. Why did his pack kill him for that and why didn't Bella or Edward do something about it other than being proud? I have to admit watching Bella get slowly killed was the only interesting thing. What is it with Stephanie Meyers and ruin great buid up with stupid little things such as the \\"imprinting\\"? Would it have been so bad for a bloody battle scene or hey maybe some sexual tension between the stars? Why is gorey violence okay but not pg-13 sensuality?
B00002R0MC|5.0|This box set is amazing. From the opening song \\" Judge not \\" on the first disc to \\" Redemption song \\" as the last song on disc four this collection will wow you ! It grabs you by the hand and takes you on a musical journey you won't forget. As you listen to each of the four discs you feel like you are right there with Bob Marley and The Wailers . The sound quality is superb .  I really love the early stuff like \\" Judge not \\" , \\" One cup of coffee \\" and \\" Simmer down \\".....but there are so many hard to find songs on here it is amazing. If you were a casual Bob Marley fan before listening to these discs you will be a fanatic when you listen through all four cds. This collection will get you pumped up....simply amazing stuff !  The message and music of Bob Marley will live forever.  Do yourself a favor : Get this box set today !!
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I usually don't write reviews, but this app is awesome.  all it needs is an option to make it a live wallpaper pleaseplease
B006E4QCXU|3.0|It's fun to play with, but it has no option that I've seen to save images for use as backgrounds. This feature would make it really great.
B00328G4XY|5.0|This is one of those 'peaked' albums. Yes, I'm sure everyone is well aware of Jimi's brilliance and sheer awesomeness, but Electric Ladyland is his crowning achievement. It's his 'Ode to Joy'. It features my all time favorite Hendrix solo (All Along The Watchtower) immediately followed by my favorite intro (Voodoo Child).  Besides these two wildly famous tracks that bring the album to an end, you're also blessed with other Jimi performances that are a little less familiar to most, but shining examples of his talent and brilliance as a composer. The track '1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)' is one of his most progressive tracks ever. It's about a 12-13 minute track that tells a wild futuristic story, but the build up, spacy middle, and well rounded close is one of The Experience's finest performances.  The other epic track on the album (clocking in at 15 minutes) is 'Voodoo Chile'. It's a haunting blues song that sounds like there's most definitely a touch of voodoo flowing through Jimi's playing, singing, words, and band. It's another one of Jimi's best.  Scattered throughout are other gems like 'Crosstown Traffic', 'Gypsy Eyes', and 'House Burning Down'. Musically, it doesn't get much better. Any Jimi Hendrix, classic rock, blues, or just great electric music fan will be grateful for purchasing this!  The packaging is pretty cool. It has a bonus DVD and a nice little booklet (no different than most CD's nowadays), but the real treasure is the music.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|The LOST series is amazing and this set is a great way to enjoy it. Plan a week away from work because its hard to stop watching.

B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|There is already written a lot about the story of Fly Away Home, so I'm not going to repeat my previous speakers.<br /><br />I have watched the movie for the first time on German TV in 1998, by chance I zapped into the movie and stayed there, mezmerized, fascinated, enchanted by its magical richness of animal (goose) beauty and lush landscape cinematography. When the film ended, I had a lump of emotion in my throat for several days. Something changed deep inside of me, namely the perception of nature, animals, birds, specifically of wild geese. Something made click inside my mind, and since then I adore geese very deeply. Before the movie, geese were of no special interest to me, oh how ignorant I was! As a matter of fact, my love is so deep and the movie inspires me so much that I want get my own geese.<br /><br />Fly Away home's cinematography and script is performed what I can describe as silent, calm, quiet and serene, but never lengthy; is performed suspense-packed, but not like a thriller movie. Romantic, but never corny or cliche. Close to life itself and nature, but never overcharged with exaggerated eco messages. In short, a perfect mixture of all the elements that make a movie worthwhile.<br /><br />The landscape shots are very idyllic (oscar nomination on this movie for cinematography) and you begin to long and crave for a life on the country-side, away from it all, the roisterous cities and its citizens with their insignificant problems of their everyday lifes. When Amy is flying in her ultralight airplane, leading the flock of geese as their surrogate mother, then you can see that the problems on land, down there, are small and trivial. That is where the geese show us how life is meant to be, more simple, more straight-forward, and peaceful. Brilliant.<br /><br />And the filmmusic, the fantastic movie score composed by Mark Isham, transports all the previous mentioned qualities and features in a perfect manner. The introductory song, 10,000 Miles by Mary Chapin Carpenter and co-composed by Mark Isham, is a real tearjearker of the special kind. This song alone summarizes what this movie is all about. Love, friendship, a deep bond among humans and animals, care for nature, peace, freedom and to never give up no matter what. The track expresses Amy's love to her family, and at the same time, the love between Amy and the wild geese. I cannot watch the movie without a package of Kleenex, and I'm male and an adult, a child at heart. I believe everyone has this ability, we just have to show it more often, and this movie can help to release the inner child in all of us.<br /><br />There is no lukewarm love story in Fly Away Home which is a big plus, if at all, it's only presented very subtle and unobtrusive. There have to be more movies like this to prevent a shallow development in our society, but I digress. The main focus of attention is clearly on the geese, who outact all human actors with feathery ease. Bravo! Please, more movies like this! There are, to my knowledge, only a handful of movies where script, cinematography, directing, music, dialogues and acting come together and are mixed in this perfection.<br /><br />I can only recommend this movie to anyone who still believes in his or her dreams and wants to realize them. This movie supports you there and makes your imaginations soar. As for my part, I'm checking out where I can get geese and how I have to keep them and gain their amazing friendship, deep bond and love. 10 stars are appropriate here. One of the most fascinating movies Hollywood has ever done, oscar-nominated, and rightly so. Big kudos. Seal of approval: Highly recommended!

B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen has released his 12th studio album, the intensely moving [[ASIN:B0067LY4WG Old Ideas]].  Not one of his albums has ever cracked the Top 50, and those few of his songs that are well-known by the mainstream public, particularly the omnipresent \\"Hallelujah,\\" are well-known for being covered by other musicians.  He's now 77 years old, and so many of those from his generation are gone, reminiscences of the past or even decades passed on.<br /><br />But here we have Cohen, there on the album's cover.  He's dressed in a suit and a tie, wearing his signature fedora and along with dark shades. He's just sitting on a wooden chair, a slight grin on his face and reading a book.  It's an appropriate pose for the man he's become, the thoughtful narrator of insightful truths who earns in acclamation what he lacks in popular recognition.<br /><br />A few years ago a younger friend who was new to Leonard Cohen's amazing body of work asked me which of his songs I liked best.  That was a hard question to answer, as there have been so many good ones, but after thinking for a few minutes, I responded by telling her that I had been recently listening to \\"Dance Me to the End of Love\\" a few times, the first song in his 1986 album [[ASIN:B0012GMW7A Various Positions]], and that the lyrics were pure poetry.<br /><br />And now on the first track of Leonard Cohen's [[ASIN:B0067LY4WG Old Ideas]], his first studio album in eight years, we hear these words, and they are almost a poetic sequel to that earlier work and so many others:<br /><br />Going home<br />Without my sorrow<br />Going home<br />Sometime tomorrow<br />To where it's better<br />Than before<br /><br />Going home<br />Without my burden<br />Going home<br />Behind the curtain<br />Going home<br />Without the costume<br />That I wore<br /><br />We are presented here with the dramatized image of a \\"lazy bastard living in a suit,\\" as Cohen puts it, and he progress to examine the futile longing for \\"a manual for living with defeat,\\" a man trying to deliver the need of a private truth.  We hear reflection of times past, of the artist wondering how long he can keep it going with songs like \\"Amen,\\" with a banjo on its fringes, its horn solo and words of the Lord's retribution.<br /><br />Like reflective poetry set to song, which it is, we hear Cohen's baritone striking a meditative note is each of his songs:<br /><br />1. Going Home<br />2. Amen<br />3. Show Me The Place<br />4. Darkness<br />5. Anyhow<br />6. Crazy To Love You<br />7. Come Healing<br />8. Banjo<br />9. Lullaby<br />10. Different Sides<br /><br />There's an almost religious finality in \\"Show Me the Place,\\" with Cohen looking for answers from above, with his smoky baritone crooning lowly over his piano.  We hear the intricate guitar finger work in \\"Darkness,\\" reminiscent of the artist's earlier works from years past, with Cohen's voice recollecting the darkness \\"... drinking from your cup.\\"<br /><br />\\"Anyhow\\" is the perfect lead-in to \\"Crazy To Love You\\" where the agonized and lovelorn lyrics seem to reflect on a larger-than-life relationship, but had its downsides: it turned out as a \\"souvenir heartache\\" in the end.<br /><br />His entreaties for reparation in \\"Come Healing\\" are there, and with the backup by its female harmonies, Cohen appeals to \\"see the darkness healing that tore the light apart,\\" his heart calling out for redemption as a penitent hymn.  And we hear a bit of lyrical play-acting in \\"Banjo.\\"<br /><br />The \\"Lullaby\\" track offers something to guide us through the long night, which Cohen, with his melancholic yet hopeful voice and lyrics, has been doing so well over the decades.  And in the closing song, \\"Different Sides\\" we hear of the discusses the opportunity of staying `good' in an often-hard world, and the effect of sex in a relationship.<br /><br />Throughout the album, even with its reflective and often redemptive tone, Cohen's bad boy audacity and often-sardonic tone that he refined decades ago is still there.  No matter how many times you listen to these, you cannot help but realize that first and foremost, Cohen is a poet.  Old Ideas isn't all about loss, infidelity and appealing to a supreme being.  The things that made Cohen vital for decades are there: cynicism, love, cravings, remorse, suffering, optimism, and yes, a bit of hamming it up.  He offers us vocal images that can range from reflective to biblical epiphany and apocalypse, and even a bit of mischievous sensuality.  It's all here.<br /><br />There have been other memorable albums from Leonard Cohen in the past, and speaking subjectively, at the top of the list would be [[ASIN:B00136JQLY The Essential Leonard Cohen]], for within this two-disc set are those songs which are considered by many to be his true classics.  Ever since hearing \\"Suzanne\\" on the radio many decades ago, this listener has been a fan, and that song is the first track of this album, along with \\"Bird on the Wire\\", \\"Chelsea Hotel #2\\", \\"Hallelujah\\", \\"Dance Me to the End of Love\\" and so many more.  It's a career-spanning collection that was originally released in 2002, all tracks from his studio albums.  For those new to Leonard Cohen and wanting to learn about his earlier offerings, one could scarcely do better than this.<br /><br />Cohen has left an imprint on music that spans across over forty years of music history, and he's been a powerful inspiration for numerous musicians.  Over four decades after his first release, \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen,\\" he's back conveying material that's a match for the complexity and clout of his first solo record, while staying as alive and remarkable a poet as ever.<br /><br />As perhaps a footnote to all of this, it should be said that when this listener received the CD, there was a pleasant surprise.  In the liner notes we find the lyrics, as expected, but it's like a separate book of poetry to read them.  Along with these are spread sone of Leonard Cohen's original artwork, along with photos of the handwritten notes that he composed during the making of this album.  The CD itself has the drawing of a woman, the same one that's in the liner notes with \\"Different Sides.\\" Have posted a simple photo of the liner and CD here.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00702MUYA Old Ideas]] is a reflective album from an artist looking back in the autumn of his years, contemplating on good and bad recollections from other times, yet it also has a real twinkle in its eye, so to speak... and it's one of Cohen's best.<br /><br />2/2/2012The things that made Cohen vital for decades are there: cynicism, love, cravings, remorse, suffering, optimism, and yes, a bit of hamming it up.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|very entertaining not bad bloody things good for kids no violent actions kids love it. GREAT app it is a should get app
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I really dig the heck out of this app. great idea, great execution, really fun stuff. Give five out of five stars, for sure! Thanks for sharing today, I hope the haters don't hurt your rating.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Love this book and love Ellen. For some reason I never really got into her sitcom, nor did I get into her stand-up comedy, but I always liked her and I've always felt she was incredibly talented... Caught a few episodes of her talk show a while back and I finally found the format that I most enjoyed her in. At least, that was until I read this book. It is no cliche to say that this book is full of warmth and comedy. More comedy than warmth, but it's a nice mix just the same!  If you like the observational humor in Ellen's book, why not give comedy/advice book The Three Dollar Scholar: Awesome Advice for Acing Life's Major Decisions and Mindless Debates a shot for only $2.99? It was written by former GQ, Men's Health and ComedyCentral.com writer Jonathan Finkel: [[ASIN:B005URS1GI The Three Dollar Scholar - Awesome Advice for Acing Life's Major Decisions and Mindless Debates]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app it has all the old games I used to play as a kid. everyone should get this app
B0063IH60K|5.0|Instead of going to bed, I promise myself &quot;Just one more game.&quot;  This happens until it's an hour past my bedtime. Anyway, I love it.
B005OK725M|4.0|I finally got to see an \\"in the flesh\\" performance by Zoe Saldana.  While the story line could definitely used some improvement, I really enjoyed Zoe's performance. She exudes sensuality in every part of the movie even when she is killing the bad guys.  I agree with one of the other reviewers when they stated that the beginning of the movie spent way too much time on her childhood.  Memory glimpses or \\"flashes\\" would have been enough to fill the audience on her motivations for her particular lifestyle.  This is the only reason I deducted a star.  Other than that, I look forward to seeing more of Zoe Saldana in the future.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Everything I wanted from a free weather app and widget. Perfectly customizable without being bloaty. It's too bad it asked me for a review instead of me wanting to give one, though.
B005GVF95O|4.0|great app. easy to control for itty bitties.  would be 5 * if it was easier for lil ones to understand how to get to next puzzle. maybe a blinking, sparkling or flashing button??
B005I6EU48|4.0|I received this product quickly, and was surprised at how much it made my Kindle resemble an actual book, which I like very much. My only complaint is that it doesn't close all the way on the Kindle, so sometimes when my Kindle is in my bag, the screen is exposed. Other than that, no problems and has held up well on international flights and bus travel throughout Italy. Grazie!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great time passer but the games get boring after a while the games are okay some aren't that fun others are mist depends why u like
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I honestly can't remember seeing a more boring absolutely pointless movie. Sound track was trying to pull off a Blade Runner or some sort of rif on a story that didn't carry the other side of a bad song. Bad ending, bad acting, bad movie. I am upset I spent time watching it.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Excellent album, with great power,style and really stays in your head. \\"Little Black Submarines\\", is already an all time classic. Would recommend to any rock fan. Five stars for sure!
B002VECM72|4.0|What a great movie. It really makes you appreciate what you have and what you take for granted on a daily basis. The fact that this is based on a true story gives me the chills - knowing that there are people like the Tuohy family in the movie that reach out and help others is comforting. Only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is simply because it has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen to get a 5. But this was an incredible movie!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|a great app that helps distract my busy mind before I fall asleep. I use it sometimes to drown out my boyfriends snoring. I love the beach selection and hope sn update comes out soon for more choices...there are dozens though to choose from.  great value and price compared to actual electronics at the store.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Happy Feet Two is an incredibly awful movie, PLEASE do not waste your money on this garbage! Your kids will hate it.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I really liked this app, but I had to remove it immediately because it can't be installed on SD drive. A time-waster app should not expect to live in main memory IMHO.
B004I744AS|5.0|i know &quot;schtup&quot; is a real word ;)  my husband was right...lol!  i also like how you can hear the word and translate it.
B000QFW7UA|4.0|Everybody has to see this movie. Of course it is corny and far-fetched, but it's a movie and that's what makes it great! This is a must have 25th Anniversary set for any Blu Ray collector. Although corny, still funny every time I watch it and a must see!
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Prior to playing Grisly Manor, I'd never encountered this type of game before.  You must find clues and then determine their use.  It's a terrific idea and these games by Fire Maple have beautiful graphics.  Many people found Grisly Manor to be too short and I would agree with that.  Lost City is quite a bit longer, but I don't think it's better.  The reason I say this is because there are far too many screens to navigate through.  It seems like every clue you find requires a trip to the furthest end.  The result is that you spend the bulk of your play clicking through screens, trying to find where the clue belongs.  This is further complicated by the fact that the map changes with the seasons, so there is basically no hope of familiarizing yourself with the layout.  I do hope this developer continues to make more apps for the Kindle; although I have a few gripes about this game, it is still worth the money.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|As time wasters go, it isn't that bad. And if you are reading this on free app day then sure go ahead and grab a copy. But the regular price is a bit high because it really doesn't entertain all but the most bored folks for more than 3 minutes..
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really tinkle that this game is good however some of the games lack a bit and require more points than possible to get
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I haven't used an app this fun in ages!  It provides an amazingly accurate picture of gravity's effects on small particles and lets you play with any and all elements of the action you could ever want to.  The beautiful patterns that emerge as you touch the screen are extremely entertaining and unique.  I'd have happily paid $2.00 for this app if I knew it was this fun.
B003EYVXUU|2.0|I am sure many will disagree, but what a lousy movie. I am certainly not on the edge of my seat in anticipation of seeing \\"Let the Right One In\\" after seeing this one. \\"Best Horror movie in 20 years\\"? In that case, I would hate to see some of the bad ones. Very slow, not much happening the whole movie. It was not at all scary, not even a little bit. It just dragged and dragged the whole time. Longest 2 hours ever. If you enjoy vampire plots, check out The Vampire Diaries. It's a show, but about 100 times better than this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the audio option is great. this is the best bible app i have used. it has a ton of great features. you won't be disappointed!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|It looks great on my phone,and with the right colors it is really trippy... I like it a lot I wish there were more like it
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|what is the &quot;sign technique&quot;, and why would i  know anything about it? this term had not been used earlier in the game.
B00715RG3Q|4.0|Dear House,  I want you to know I'm concerned for your well-being. You need to start wearing gloves while handling your patients, particularly your blood soaked ones.  Much love,  Katarina
B0017TYPIG|4.0|I am generally not a fan of \\"older\\" movies, but this was a good one! Paul Newman is great in this role. I like how he does whatever he wants and refuses to cave in to authority. I may feel different if he went to prison for something more serious than a misdemeanor, but it gives the movie a little bit of humor and has it's fill of drama at the same time.
0525478817|5.0|I was blown away by this book  -funny, touching, full of symbolism.....highly recommended...  Don't be put off thinking this is either a YA book or a morbid topic...just read it and love it!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I wanted this game so bad but I did not want to pay for it now it is free hay
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Season four of the iconic Dexter series is a real \\"sit on the edge of the couch\\" season. Dexter fans are pulled by the high's and low's of this season and at the season finale, my wife and I just starred at the TV for 10 minutes in disbelief! It's a DON\\"T miss season!
B004856SQ8|1.0|THIS REVIEW IS FOR A USED COPY OF THE ABOVE - **DISSAPPOINTING** Love this movie, and I bought the above as I was interested in the extras. Got it in the mail  yesterday, and IT\\"S A RENTAL COPY WITH NO EXTRAS AT ALL (which was the whole point of buying it). If I didnt care about the extras, I would have bought it used at my local Blockbuster closing down sale for $5 total! Thats what I get for trying to get a cheap deal I suppose.
B001BPQT8A|4.0|One of Brad Pitt's best. If you like Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, drama, crime, detective/police movies - this is the one for you. It keeps your attention throughout the whole movie with a bit of a twist at the end.
B000SEIKIW|2.0|I really liked \\"A Brief History of Time\\", but I was disappointed with this rehash.  It is essentially the same anecdotes without the meat.  I felt as though I were reading a review for children.  If you have read the original, skip this one.
B0007GAEGC|3.0|Loved the clear,crisp quality of the voices in Greatest Journey, New Journey etc. Album lacks the celtic flare and \\"accent\\" present in the concerts. The performance dosen't match up, the orchestra, drummers and backup enthusiasm isen't here.The beauty of the Women's voices is lost in the \\"americanization\\" of the singing.
0439023491|3.0|Catching Fire is the second book of the Hunger Games Trilogy.  I really loved the first book and it is difficult for the second installment to live up to the first one especially once the excitement of the newness has worn off.  However, where the series felt like it was going was a big leap that had to be made in this book and it does it well enough.  There are some great new characters and while the story is a bit of a repetition of the first book, there are new aspects that are really imaginative.  There is also some good growth in Katniss's character.  On the down side, I felt all the major plot twists were a bit predictable from the very beginning to the point that I already had a good idea of how it would end.  Even when I think Collins was trying to mislead us with new characters, I felt there true intentions were obvious - that might have been the point that we are suppose to know but Katniss isn't to highlight her difficulty relating to others.  Overall, it was an enjoyable read but not as good as book one.<br /><br />The three stars was my initial impression of the book but having finished the series, I take more issue with Catching Fire in hindsight.  On the major downside, after reading the third book, Mockingjay, Catching Fire was nearly unnecessary.  The action that happens in the third book feels rushed and what it accomplishes is much greater than what the first two books accomplished combined - granted Collins decides to wrap up the story in the last 20 pages of the third book. Even the love triangle is made nearly pointless by book three - there could've been more progression on the love triangle in Catching Fire since there really wasn't a place for it in Mockingjay. Considering the repititious nature of Catching Fire, the overall arc of the story would've been better laid out if the action and tone shift of Mockingjay had started somewhere in Catching Fire.
B005ZUR724|3.0|Great game with graphics that are good. Didn't see it was a subscription based game but oh well. The community is horrible. Very unfriendly people with snotty remarks to newcomers. If I could Id rather play alone then with the kids who spam the chat with very hateful remarks to booby questions. Sorry not all of us instantly know the game as soon as we get it.  Refund.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun in just one app and it is like I am playing 101 games at once and the best thing is that it was free
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Title says it all. Only issue I had was a stylus would have been helpfull on a few of the games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was needing an easy way to quickly find my way around the Bible, and this has got to be the best app ever! when I don't have time to read I can just listen to different verses while I work and and absorb the word of our Lord.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the rope has dozens of very clever physics-based puzzles you pretty much need to solve before you get anything else done. So, clear out your calendar, it's going to be fun times from here on out. Better than Angry Birds, in my opinion.
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 tells the story of Jake Epping, a high school English teacher in rural Maine.  Jake lives a simple, if somewhat sad life.  His alcoholic ex-wife has left him, it seems like there is something missing in his career, and one of his closest friends is Al, the owner of the local diner who spends his days slinging his famous fatburgers.  One day Al starts acting strange, only to confess to Jake that he has been traveling in time through the pantry of his diner with one mission--to stop the assasination of JFK on 11/22/63.  Al also tells Jake he is about to die, and that he wants Jake, as George Amberson, to take over his mission.  And so our hero's journey into the past--a clear September day in 1958 to be exact--begins.<br /><br />What follows is an epic journey that on the surface is about the consequence of time travel but really is about so much more.  This book had a little bit of everything related to the human condition--love, friendship, sorrow--while exploring what it is that makes us human.  It also explores the past in amazing detail, which makes you feel like you're experiencing America in the early 1960s.  The storytelling is so rich, you'll feel like you're imersed in Jake/George's world, and after the first 50 pages, you won't be able to put this book down.<br /><br />There's a reason why King is considered a master storyteller, and it's truly on display here in this fantastic piece of fiction.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love it , it is great! easy, effeicent, smart I play it all of the time it is not cheesey at All I recommend.  it
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Just opened this app up on the kindle fire and its great! Definitely much better than the native Pdf reader, SPECIALLY for pdfs that are based mostly on images, not selectable text. The rendering of the letters is much much clearer. The app also has diffrrant view modes which is quite helpful. So far I am quite happy with adobe reader for kindle fire.
0880796863|4.0|After reading the reviews, I was initially on the side of all who complained about the USGAMES copyright on the front. That was before I ordered my deck. Placing this on the cards is in poor taste, but it's incredibly tiny. Unless you seriously just hate the thought of it being there, it's not large enough to be a distraction. You have to squint or hold the card close to your face to even make out that they're words. It's literally that tiny. If you're above a certain age, you may not be able to find the little words at all! I didn't even notice it till I remembered the reviews and thought to look for it. I still say it's in poor taste, but it won't stand in the way of a reading.<br /><br />The coloring of the cards isn't very vibrant, as others have said. The colors really are quite orangey, too! However, as I've never owned a deck of actual Rider-Waite cards before, it doesn't matter as much to me as it might to others. Depending on how you read, better coloring might be appreciated. Personally, I only bought the deck just to have a set of Rider-Waite cards, and I do appreciate *finally* having a deck with those timeless images that even non-tarot readers have seen before.<br /><br />I think the off coloring actually gives the deck an antique sort of feel, and I appreciate it for what it is. I already know the cards by their images, so it's nice to have a deck with those images actually on the cards. =-)<br /><br />As for the booklet it contains, it really is small. If you need a book to help you out, you should probably purchase a separate tarot book (such as Tarot Plain and Simple by Anthony Louis). This booklet doesn't have enough info for newbies who are serious about learning tarot. If you're just playing around and getting used to the cards, the accompanying book should be fine till you're sure you're serious about tarot.<br /><br />This deck has its own charm, and may be better suited for people who don't need to rely heavily upon the coloring and detail. On the other hand, it may not be so complicated after all, as anyone who has a real interest in tarot has probably seen most of these images before, and can probably connect a lot of the cards to at least one meaning already.<br /><br />My oldest has taken an interest in Tarot cards, and I will be using this deck to teach him because these images are most common. I already have him going over the cards and telling me what they mean to him based on the images alone, and with no background information. He's only 10 and he's doing well with it, though some of the things he may be too young to grasp on his own, such as the High Priestess. Better coloring might help for some, but so far the old feel of this deck doesn't seem to hurt.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|great way to keep track of school assignments. it is quick and easy to add new tasks. I also like the widget.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|App is very unique &amp; fun, too bad I can't play with it for more than 5 seconds without it freezing on me and then foreclosing on Hubby's Inspire 4G...but I bet it will be awesomely smooth on my HTC EVO 4G :P Can't wait to try it out on EVO, will be uninstalling on Inspire..please fix it so it will work on it!! 5 Stars when compatible with Inspire4G / Desire HD.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|I have seen a lot about the screen protector and bubble problem. My wife works for sprint and when I got it I tried to put on screen protector on it that came with the phone. I had bunch of bubbles. She puts them all the time so I asked her to do it. She could not do it either without bubbles. I am wondering about the gorilla glass and the fact that maybe that is what is the cause. I would have to some research on that.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the different games!!! I like the challenge to my brain, and really making me think! it is really cool to!

1451648537|4.0|This was probably the best biography I have ever read.  While Steve Jobs was very well known, probably one of the more recognizable people in the world for the past couple of decades.<br /><br />But, only whispers have been out there about the type of person he really was, and this book lays all of that out very clearly.  I have read other reviews from people who know him or worked for him who felt the book did not truly represent how difficult a person he was.  Never having met Steve Jobs I cannot say if anything was missing.  But, it paints a very interesting picture of Steve Jobs as a child who was adopted as an infant; Steve Jobs the young man who became interested in the new technologies that were becoming available; Steve Jobs the entrepreneur who was able to bring people together on a shoestring and develop a small business; to the man who reinvented computing, movies, the music industry and then went on to put computing in the cloud.<br /><br />His personal habits were strange, and his relationships with family, colleagues and friends were strained at best.  His personal drive combined with his quest for perfection and need for complete control allowed him to develop products that no one else could. The book clearly describes how this was done.<br /><br />His premature death last year was a great loss to innovation.  The author says that Steve Jobs asked him, before the book was published and before he actually read it, if there was anything he would dislike.  I have to say that this book does not show Jobs as a likable person, or one that would be easy (at all) to work for.  However, I think this will become the book that people will look to about how an amazing man was able to drive innovation and to lead others to do the impossible.
1416955070|4.0|When I told one of my friends I was thinking of checking this series out, he lent me a copy of his own, and it was a really good read. Though I feel the storytelling technique could've been improved somehow. Inspite of that, I was seriously jaw-dropped over several heavy twists (though a couple I saw from the getgo), others completely floored me. Twist-wise, I felt like it was Harry Potter-esque with all the supernatural characters and deeply complex characters and their personality structures even when you know you have them figured out, they say or do something that still ended up throwing me off, so it kept me going. Reading about their histories, the history of the Shadowhunters, the history of their home (Idris), and more, it was really good for an imaginary trip. As for the humor, I agree with what Lady Dorothea says about Jace's humor (read and find out, I'm not ruining a good one-liner!), but he does have some good crack-out-loud moments. And so does everyone else, some of the humor's okay, the rest, I had a hard time keeping my laughter in (I mostly read in public place). Now I'm looking forward to the second book, expecting it to be as good/better.

B002K0WBYG|5.0|This is an easy movie to watch. Not heavy or lengthy. A great cast of characters accentuates the humor. This movie should appeal to most audiences. It is one of my favorite Sandra Bullock movies.

B002HHPVHQ|2.0|When I began this book, and being conservative politically, I thrilled at the exposure of the Clinton Administration as the crux of the sub-prime mortgage debacle. But a little research will show that many people from both sides of the aisle were culpable so MacDonald is being a little disingenuous about that deplorable episode in American politricks.  If you are not familiar with the many acronyms used in the financial industry this book will enlighten you as to their meaning. Great, I like to be educated. MacDonald also explains the world of high finance so consider this a primer, another plus for me who has ignored much of that nonsense for most of my life. Sort of like A Brief History of Time for the financially illiterate.  There are a few things that are conspicuous by their absence. First, the ubiquitous use of prostitutes to help take the edge off, you know, relieve all that stress created by those mighty feats of genius done on the trading floors. The second absence from the story is the use of cocaine. Someone who gets up at 4am, works out, gets to the office by 6am, trades all day in the boiler room, and then goes out for dinner with his trading friends is going to need a little help along the way. Not a word on either thing was present in the story that I can remember.  Mr. MacDonald paints a rather rosy picture of himself and perhaps he is trying to cover his ass just in case the Federal Government starts doing it's job of protecting the American public and actually issues some arrest warrants for the high-flying crooks on Wall Street.  With all the weaknesses in the story I still enjoyed reading the book. If you don't want to give another nickel to this guy there are other ways of obtaining the book, either from the library, a friend, or the Internet.
1451627289|5.0|This book was an absolute phenominal read and was one of the best new Stephen King works to come out in a while with the exception of Under the Dome which was also great.  This book is pretty long, but the speed, interesting concepts and phenominal writing make it go by in the blink of an eye and make you wish that there was even more.  The book itself is not your typicl King work, this one feels even more in depth and even more thought out than the usual combinding action, adventure, romance, and emotion while still maintaiing his classic awesome sci-fi horror feel.  I definately recommend this book and I definatly think it is a must read.  This book is one of my favorite Stephen King works, and is on par with many of his great older works.  After a few crummy books, it seems like Kings writing is back where it should be.  The book follows Jake, a teacher bored with life and bored with his job.  A friend of his from town tells him about a time portal located in his diner that is a gateway to 1958.  After discussing the possibilities of changing the future for the better, or for the worse, and after discussing the butterfly effect Jake goes through for a test run.  However on returning he realizes that time starts over again if he steps  through again.  After this Jake and his friend discuss the ultimate plan.. Killing Oswald before he can kill Kennedy and thereby preventing the Vietnam war from escalating and possibly changing the future for the better.  Jake steps back into the portal and starts his life in 1958, with a fake ID, and some old money.  Jake first goes to save a student of his from his rampaging murdrous father and it is here that he learns that the past itself is resistant and combative to being changed and will not be changed easily, especially when multiple lives are at stake.  The rest of the book follows the lead up to the events of the assassination as well as Jake's planning.  Jake also finds himself in love, with a woman, a love that has to ability to get in the way.  Along the way Jake comes head to head with every conspiracy theory on the planet, from rogue elements in the CIA, to the Mafia, to the \\"second shooter theory\\".  You are going to have to read as to wheter he suceeds and if he does if history changes for the positive or negative, becuase I refuse to put spoilers.  Every decision that Jake makes and every mistake that happens leads him eithe rcloser to fulfilling his goal or dying in 1958.  This book is a must read,  and you must by it ASAP.

B0064NTZQ2|1.0|IF this film had lived up to its title, then it might have been more interesting and certainly more moving. The vast majority of this overlong movie is wasted, with the camera spending way too much time on comatose characters. Yes, they have lovely profiles but are boring beyond belief! The actual driving sequences are pretty good, especially the first heist. After that the movie just dies. Long dull sections broken by over-the-top violence.  I am not opposed to violence in action films. However in this movie it is senseless and not needed. The main characters are so dead that it wouldn't take much violence to shake the film up. The gratuitous shotgun to the head, the double stabbing...way over kill. Oscar Isaac as Standard was the only believable character in the film.  A waste of money and time.  If you want to see non-stop, edge of your seat, action in a film get the French film \\"Point Blank.\\" That will keep your adrenaline pumping for a long time after the movie is over with. Unlike this piece of crap.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|When I put on the mono \\"Revolver\\" from this set, I was blown away the same as when I was 13 years old. The sounds coming from the speakers were exactly as I remembered them. It sounds nothing like the original stereo CD. Then I put on Rubber Soul, and I was toast. Better sound quality, better overall balance, more bass and punchier compression. The remastered stereo mixes are an improvement over the old CDs, but the mono mixes were better mixes. This is the most exciting music I've heard in many, many years and it's almost 50 years old.

B005VPRET4|4.0|My 8yo daughter loves building Legos (as do her two brothers) and loved the look of these sets when she saw them come out and bought this one with her own money.  It's cute, it's girly, but it's not as \\"Lego\\" as a \\"traditional\\" set. Of the 222 pieces, SO MANY of them are \\"accessories.\\"  Utensils, foods, etc.  Not very much for building and more for playing very teeny pretend play.  But you're paying Lego prices for that.  It competes well with things like littlest pet shop, ponies, etc, but not so well with other lego sets.  My daughter also has some other lego favorites she thinks are cool - the lighthouse with the light-up brick, the camping trailer with car to pull it (we own a camper), the 3-in-1 fishing cabin, etc.  For actual building, you get more bang for your buck with the \\"traditional\\" sets. They are also more challenging and time-consuming which she likes.  It hardly took any time at all to put this set together and now it just sits on her shelf.  I'm actually kinda personally offended that they made it this way.  I'm sure some kids will love the quick put-together but can't Lego come out with some \\"girl\\" sets that aren't SO girly?
B006E4QCXU|3.0|this app is a lot of fun in the beginning. HOWEVER the thrill quickly goes away leaving you saying &quot; now what? &quot; It is a great idea but is rather boring.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I like the app, but I have to agree with the other reviews that it really needs a way to save pics or better yet live wallpapers. I would definitely give this app 5 stars if those features were added.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Nice relaxing app,  would make for an excellent live wallpaper! Dev,  please add this feature for five stars,  good work!!!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies of all time. I ordered this for my husband as it is his favorite movie. It arrived on his birthday, which was great!  My favorite scene from the movie is when Sgt. York calls out to the German soldiers by using his turkey call \\"gobble, gobble, gobble.\\"
B006H3MIV8|5.0|Like some others commenting here, I'm an aging ex-hippie who has always felt grateful to be alive on the planet at the same time as Bob. His songs and music have again and again blown me away . . John Wesley Harding, Blood on the Tracks, Infidels, Modern Times and on and on. It's been my view, grown over the years, that one key factor in his work is the sheer passion woven into his songs and performances. Sure, I love the brilliant words, the deep-rooted music and the various metaphysical planes. But I think what really gets us all, \\"like a corkscrew down the heart\\" is the intensity of feeling.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this whopper set of covers. I don't think it's really too important to pick apart how \\"great\\" some of the performances are. Some are fantastic, some are simple, some are odd. But I get the sense over all that most, if not every one of these artists and groups, genuinely love Dylan's music, support Amnesty Intl, and tried to put their heart and soul into their contributions.<br /><br />When you hear new covers (though I've heard so many before!) bringing some of Dylan's most fascinating songs - and not just the favorite chestnuts - into vivid life, new musical forms, new vocalizations, it gets me astounded all over again how amazing they are. And on quite a few of these, I'll tell ya, it brings me to tears.
B0063IH60K|5.0|what a great game for kindle fire I love it and would recommend it to anyone you should get it now it's free! !!!
0380725398|2.0|DuMaurier's best works rise above the formulaic romances that have become cliché.  Not this one.  The protagonist's inner conflict does not spring from the same insight that created \\"The Scapegoat\\" or \\"My Cousin Rachel.\\" This poor girl of the moors is a bore.  The most interesting character isn't in the book enough to compensate.  Try another one instead.
B000OYC7A8|3.0|This three-star review is referencing the DVD reproduction of this concert, which is the product being purchased here.  The concert performance is amazing, the DVD version of it is flawed.  Maybe my ears are bit more sensitive to sonic anomalies, however I was very disappointed to be continually distracted by sudden drops in audio level.  Other owners of this DVD have mentioned noticing the same drops in amplitude.  I can't be sure whether the drops occurred in tracking, mixing or mastering (let's hope not).  The bands performance, quite easily, overcomes these technical shortcomings.  However, I cannot believe that quality control would not have caught this prior to release.
0545123291|5.0|*May contain spoilers for Shiver!*<br /><br />The first thing I should say is wow. This book was a pleasant surprise for me. It took me ages to read this book because Shiver was not very impressive to me. It was just so-so. Linger was beautiful! I am so glad I finally decided to pick it up. Once I did though, it was very hard for me to put down. I only did so because of need, not want.<br /><br />  \\"This is the story of a boy who used to be a wolf and a girl who was becoming one.\\"<br /><br />Even though this opening sentence tells you what you should expect from Linger, it does little to convey how heartbreaking and intense this story is about to become.<br /><br />Linger begins a few months after where Shiver left us. Sam and Grace are the ever-happy couple. Isabel is bitter and angry, still trying to get over the death of her brother. Beck is a wolf permanently, and the newbie wolves he created at the end of Shiver are going to be shifting back to their human forms soon thanks to the coming of Spring.<br /><br />One of these wolves is Cole. He and Isabel each have a voice in this installment, along with Sam and Grace. Cole is a self-loathing, ex-band member who wants nothing more than to escape himself by being a wolf. When he and Isabel meet, she can't help but feel a sense of disgust at this, and yet there is another feeling lurking in the depths of her tangled mind. One that seems to keep bringing the two of them together no matter how much they seem to insult one another.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Sam and Grace have been living in a blissful bubble ever since Sam was \\"cured\\" of his wolven disease. Each night, Sam sneaks into Grace's room and they drift off to sleep in each others' arms. For the two of them, life couldn't be any better now that they have the promise of a future together.<br /><br />Then things suddenly take a turn for the worse. Grace becomes severely ill, and even though both she and Sam would love to sit back and deny and ignore the issue, they both know this is no ordinary illness. With the help of Cole and Isabel, our two lovebirds are forced to face the problem head-on in a way that no one could have foreseen.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />I love it when I don't have to list my dislikes because they weren't any. :)<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater has such an amazing literary voice. I would definitely put her in the top 3 on my list of writers who can truly move me with their work. Even when I don't care for her books 100% (in the case of Shiver, or The Scorpio Races), I am still incredibly impressed with her writing. It never fails to wow me and leave me in tears.<br /><br />I like that this book had the added POVs of Cole and Isabel. It broadened the storyline and made about more than just a boy and a girl falling in love. About halfway through, I was beginning to feel confused as to why Cole was even part of the story. In the end, you see why. In the end it all makes sense. All the details you wonder about become clear. Maggie laid out all the clues and hints we needed, but was never obvious about where she was taking the story. I was immensely pleased with how all the intricacies of the plot were so easily woven together during the climax.<br /><br />The romance in this book wasn't quite as in-your-face as it was in Shiver. It took a backseat to the rest of the storyline, but was still a resolute presence in the background. It didn't need too much attention, because it just is. I like that there isn't a love triangle in this series (unless one pops up in the finale). Ms. Stiefvater didn't need to embellish on Sam and Grace's love by making one of them choose the other over someone else, because it's strong all on it's own.<br /><br />This installment has our cast of characters questioning everything they think they know about the wolves. How they came to be, how they shift, how they stop shifting, and eventually what brings on their deaths. Everything they think they've ever known is changed, altered... and it brings up a multitude of new problems and questions. The twists and turns that manifested in this installment were all seamlessly woven into the plot, and presented in the perfect fashion.<br /><br />I really could keep going, but I think I'll stop here. All in all, Linger was one of the most impressive sequels I've ever read. It was beautiful and enchanting. It was heartbreaking and surprising. There was never a dull moment and I found it exceedingly hard to put down. Even if you weren't a huge fan of Shiver, I'd still recommend giving this book a shot. The writing is magical and the story is otherworldly. The end had me begging for more. I can't wait to get started on Forever!ssly woven into the plot, and presented in the perfect fashion.

145162445X|5.0|Intriguing book that does not avoid the hard questions and comes up with plausible arguments that are partly based on empirical research and partly on logic.  For a not-so-briliant mind like me (I didn't study physics), some notions like for instance \\"virtual zero energy photons\\" on page 164 are hard to grasp. But still, this is a very well-readable book for those who are interested in this subject and have some basic knowledge in physics and maths. It also combines scientific knowledge and reasoning with a flavor of humor that I found very pleasing to read.  The one down side to reading a topic like this is that it can be challenging to explain others what on earth you are reading.

After only two days of Wheat abstinence, my energy level is soaring. Have I shaken the shackles of HYPERGLYCEMIA? Whatever the reason, including Placebo effect, I'll take it. Information in this book  that, Wheat is in the same league as sugar for inducing hyperglycemia, is enough to justify the purchase of this miracle book.  The present day Wheat has nothing in common the healthy Wheat of  yesteryears, except the name. Again from this book.  Please don't take my word for it try it.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|The mistake many people make when they take on this album are that many are reading Lana Del Ray's biography before even listening it. Thus, this gives the listener a preconceived opinion of the artist before they've even heard anything they do. Such is the case with many negative critics of Lana Del Ray. The \\"negative review\\" of course is always the most fun to write, but before there was internet, people weren't so brave to bash and you'd only be doing yourself a disservice if you did so before just listening to Born To Die. Yes, let's state the obvious that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion. Perhaps this album's biggest flaw is that it is so dependent upon the old school approach to music which is that of a listener's \\"immediate response\\" to simply just liking something for what it is. Fortunately for us folks, Born To Die actually has real substance too! Before internet comments determined what we were to like and not like we simply had our likes and dislikes and agreed to disagree on things. We had to depend on whatever came on in our everyday lives and something either grabbed your attention or it didn't and you either liked it or you didn't. Eyes absorbing a blog to look for what is currently cool or trendy didn't come into play. We didn't care where a person came from or what their background was until we'd already fallen in love with their tunes and even then it wouldn't take our adoration away from the artist.  I believe Lana Del Ray's album to be one of the bravest releases in quite some time. The album stays consistent throughout and never falters from it's dreamy, and honest landscape. It remains dependent on its tunes to pull you in and you're either along for the ride or you're not. Even down to the cover art Lana Del Ray declares her composure in a very modest look as if to point out pop music's current dependence on the gratuitous sleazed up image to grab (of all things) a \\"listener's\\" attention. Anymore we're expected to care more about the person than their music and Lana Del Ray seems to know it. Yes, this is a heavy album but not at all in a bad way. Each song has it's own uniqueness with so many strong melodies coming at you one right after the other and in that way it can feel overwhelming to take such a setlist in especially when we live in a music world where the 2nd half of albums are expected to be pointless listens. Our ears simply aren't always trained for such consistency. The beginning-to-end strong pop album has become a thing of the past and this album makes us finally sets our bars high once again by reminding us such a thing can exist and we as music consumers should demand it. This is pop music at it's finest. Lyrically Del Ray is 100% on the money , fully aware of what she is doing. The cliche and the typcial situation are thrown in left and right but performed and delivered in such ways where they sound completely new, and declared with such refreshing viewpoints that I actually believe Lana Del Ray when she's telling her story. And even if they're not all true it seems to not matter. I find this album to be albeit undeniable if one just simply listens to it. Don't concern yourself right now with who she is or where she came from but let yourself be that person who once simply loved songs and music just because you loved them. The immediate response to a song is always your best bet and with this album it should no doubt be a truly positive one. I really hope Lana Del Ray sticks around and continues to put out albums as good as this one. This truly is a wonderful album, beginning to end.

0596806027|5.0|First and foremost, it is important to realize the majority of bad reviews for this book are the result of a mis-understanding of its content. This is the result of poor marketing (the title) and in that regard, those reviews justified. If you are looking for a succinct overview of the html5 spec with a focus on practical examples, consider [[ASIN:0321784421 Introducing HTML5 (2nd Edition)]]<br /><br />That being said, this book's author is very well known and respected for his writing style, and he does not stray from it in this book (Dive into Python, Dive into Accessibility, etc.). His approach to writing on subject's as complex as HTML5 is to choose a few topics that are important, complicated, often overlooked, or simply interesting, then take a \\"deep dive\\" into them. He talks about things in this book that you likely won't find elsewhere, including digging up decades old discussions to help you understand just why certain things have evolved the way they have, and how it has / will continue to impact the industry. Some popular reviews consider this type of discussion 'mildly amusing', and I can only assume they have little interest in the field beyond its ability to sustain them economically. Fair enough. But if your interest goes a bit deeper, and you like to know just why things are the way they are, you won't be disappointed in this excellent book.<br /><br />On a related note, this title (like all of Mark Pilgrim's books) is available online.

B004132HZS|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories all of my life. When I heard they were updating Holmes to the 21st century, I groaned in pain and thought for certain that I was going to hate it.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  They have managed to update Sherlock Holmes while keeping the integrity of the characters and Doyle's creation absolutely intact. Fans of the Holmes canon will recognize many familiar aspects of the original stories, set into entirely new scenarios in ways that are very clever, a lot of fun, and sometimes designed to play little tricks on the fans of the stories by \\"changing them up\\" in ways designed to surprise them when they THINK they know what a clue means, or how something is supposed to turn out. Fans will also be amused to see familiar lines from the stories updated and incorporated, such as (without giving any spoilers) what Holmes described as a \\"three-pipe problem\\" becomes a \\"three patch problem.\\" (Meaning nicotine patches.)  The show is a virtual scavenger hunt of quotes and scenes from the stories that will keep Holmes fans entertained, and the better you know the stories, the more rewards you find.  Benedict Cumberbatch is an absolute TREASURE.  He is my favorite Sherlock Holmes second only to the brilliant Jeremy Brett, and if I am not mistaken, I believe that I have been seeing little salutes from Cumberbatch to Brett in little things he does, in his physical approach to the character. (Things he does with his hands, the way he'll sit in a chair... things he does that will seem familiar to fans of Brett's Holmes.)  Martin Freeman portrays Dr. John Watson flawlessly with great feeling, and Cumberbatch and Freeman together have impeccable chemistry. They are backed up by an amazing supporting cast.  You will find yourself loving and cheering for these characters wholeheartedly.  This show might be set in the 21st century, but it is absolutely Arthur Conan Doyle's characters updated almost seamlessly.  I think Doyle wouldbe proud and delighted by this production.  FANTASTIC JOB, BBC!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Well done another food stamp for WB at the cost of a good film, don't watch or buy.  The first one was good this was awful.
0307949486|4.0|I have to say I couldn't put this book down.  I had to read the book from cover to cover quickly.  However,  there seemed to be, for me, flaws witht he book.  Lisabeth seemed to be a tiny little thing that had such a hard life, yet reading about her it seemed like I wanted to tell her \\"get real and get a life\\" at times.  However, that did not take away too much from the actual book.  The book itself had great character development and a well written storyline.  I enjoyed reading this particular book because it showcases women as a powerful and self confident indiduals.  Furthermore, it was refreshing to read a crim/dective novel that gave a uniqe prespective about what life is like amoung people in their own culture.  I highlhy recommend this book to anyone.
B006QANR5I|5.0|It was just the kind of thing you want to watch at Chrstmas.  Love, intrigue, a dashing rogue, Maggie Smith and the immortal line \\"do you promise?\\", happiness, tears and snow (though it fell upward at times).  On Christmas evening it worked beautifully.  I hope the story will be the same if seen at another time of year when we aren't so content with ourselves.  It WAS good and I have watched it a number of times.  Buy the US set where it's included and it's worth it.  Bring on series 3, set to begin filming next month.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I like this cover. It's cute, functional. It stays closed. The only thing it doesn't do well, is prop open. I think you have to kind of 'break' it in. Other than that, it work great. I carry it around with me in my purse, diaper bag, where ever and no problems.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|...is a virtue/vice many do not have anymore.  As stated often earlier, this watch harkens back to the 70's movies that move slow and methodical without the camera angles changing twice per second, etc.  There is very little dialogue to waste and wonderful tunes to accompany the story.  Still today, folks communicate with their demeanor, eyes, etc., as this show does.  NOTHING is spelled out clearly or explained for the viewers other than the jolting scenes when they occur.  And although some items are explicit, they seem to fit for the characters and the mood.  The pace and volume of the first 1/2 or so engulfs the viewer and perfectly complements the second 1/2, and boosts the tension higher as the story unfolds.  This show is not complicated; just a well-crafted and fun movie to experience.  I will watch it again... often.
0071762345|3.0|This is the first book on Social Media that taught me something, giving me practical applications and useful guidelines. Most of the other books I've invested in brought nothing to the table that I didn't already know, or didn't get every day in my inbox from a free resource. It's a book geared towards people who are learning to use Social Media; I don't think there is much in here for experienced players.  The focus is predominantly on using Facebook, so if you are looking for help with Twitter, LinkedIn, or other tools, this is not that book.  On occasion throughout the book, the author encourages the reader to test-drive some of his suggestions in ways that, ultimately, benefit him/his company, ie, sharing or liking his company site or content from the book. Given that the premise of his book is to treat your customer the way you like to be treated, and no one likes to be annoyed (or, presumably, suckered), that felt a bit disingenuous. I guess even the experts can cross a line.  You won't keep this book as a reference - it's not that kind of book; it's the book you read, get what you need, and pass along (or sell as used on Amazon.com). I passed mine on to my counterpart who is managing our Facebook presence.

1935597760|4.0|This book took me by surprise.  I loved the way it was written, and I think that Christina McKenna did a fabulous job at telling Jamie's story.  The chapters that delved into Jamie's traumatic childhood were very sad and deeply upsetting, but I think that it was so simply and yet skilfully written that the reader would pity Jamie the boy, but champion Jamie the man. My favourite part of the story was the episode with Jamie's toupee.  At the time, I was reading the book in an office full of people, in the middle of the day. I started off with a slight smile on my face, which extended to a smirk, that resulted in some giggling, before I burst out laughing.  I had to excuse myself for a few minutes as I was on the verge of wetting myself in front of my colleagues. The descriptions in this book are great. I think the author was able to strike a fine balance in telling the story and allowing room for the reader's imagination to do the rest.  This book is not for everyone.  Yes, it's pace is slow, but I think the story, the serious issues it tackles and what needs to be unravelled makes this tempo necessary.  By the end of the book, I was happy that Jamie was happy, at last.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|I like the concept however I am not finding any of the cool options I have been reading about. anyone know why? I have it on my kindle fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|many editions of the Bible in almost every language. the app occasionally has difficulty syncing with the server but works effortlessly 95% of the time.  would recommend

B0034DBRFC|5.0|I love this CD & the DVD is alot better than I thought. It was nice to see Belinda in concert since I never got a chance when these hits came out. After watching this I wish I would have. A bonus is that she sings Go-Go hits that you can actual hear her sing. I got the Go-Go's live in Central park & most songs you could only hear the instruments. On this you can hear her fabulous voice
B006N0MLJO|5.0|BuildCalc is everything you need in a construction calculator.  I'll be using this on my kindle fire. The daylight mode is a great additional feature. Very well documented. Well worth the price.
0374275637|5.0|A fantastic book, highly recomend that you add it to your reading list.  Here is a summary of the book.  I simply selected a few quotes from each chapter end, as being representative of the material in the chapter.  PART ONE - TWO SYSTEMS  1. The Characters of the Story  * He had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.  * This was a pure System 1 response.  She reacted to the threat before she recognized it.  * This is you System 1 talking.  Slow down and let your System 2 take control.  2. Attention and Effort  * What came quickly to my mind was an intuition from System1.  I'll have to start over and search my memory deliberately  * I won't try to solve this while driving.  This is a pupil-dilating task.  It requires mental effort!  3. The Lazy Controller  * His ego was depleted by long meetings.  So he just turned to standard op procedures instead of thinking through the problem  * She did not struggle to stay on task for hours, was in a state of Flow  * He did not bother to check if it made sense.  Does he usually have lazy System2, or was he just tired?  4. The Associative Machine  * The sight of those guys in uniforms does not prime creativity  * They were primed to find flaws, and that's what they found  * His System 1 constructed a story, and System 2 believed it.  Happens all the time.  * I made myself smile, and I'm actually feeling better.  5. Cognitive Ease  * Don't dismiss the biz plan just b/c the font makes it hard to read  * We probably inclined to believe it, b/c it's been repeated so often, but let's think through it again  * I'm in a great mood today, so my System 2 is weaker than usual.  I should be extra careful  6. Norms Surprises and Causes  * When we survey reaction to these products, let's make sure we do not just focus on the average.  We must consider the entire range of normal reactions  * She won't accept that she was just unlucky.  She needs a casual story.  She will end up thinking that someone intentionally sabotagedher work.  7. A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions  * She knows nothing about his management skills.  All she is going by is the Halo effect from a good presentation.  * Let's reduce errors by obtaining separate judgements on the issue before Any discussion.  We will get more info from independent assessments  * They don't want any more information, it might spoil their story.  They are relying on WYSIATI - what you see is all there is.  8. How Judgments Happen  * Circuits in your brain evaluate dominance from face shapes.  He Looks the part for a leadership role  * The punishment won't feel right unless its intensity matches the crime  * Evaluating people as attractive/unattractive is Not a basic assessment -- you do it automatically whether or not you want to, and it influences you  9. Answering an Easier Question  * Do we still remember the Q we are trying to answer?  Or have we substituted an easier one ?  * The Q we face is whether the candidate can succeed.  The Q seem to answer is whether she interviews well.  Let's not substitute  * He likes the project, so thinks the costs are low and benefits are high.  Nice example of the affect heuristic  Characteristics of System 1, The Fast System  PART TWO - HEURISTICS AND BIASES  10. The Law of Small Numbers  * Yes, studio had 3 great films since the new CEO took over.  But too early to declare that he has a hot hand.  * I will keep results of experiment locked until we have sufficiently large sample.  Or we will face pressure to reach a conclusion prematurely.  * Sample of observations is too small to make inferences, let's not fall for the law of small numbers  11. Anchors  * Our aim in the negotiation is to get them anchored on this number  * The firm we want to acquire has sent us revenue estimates: do not let that number influence our thinking, set it aside.  * Their lawyers put in a frivolous reference in which they mentioned a ridiculous number for damages, and they got the judge anchored on it!  12. The Science of Availability  * Because of 2 plane crashes this month, she now prefers the train.  That's silly, because the risk has Not changed, it is an availability bias.  * She has been watching too many spy movies recently, so she's seeing conspiracies everywhere  * He underestimates the risk of indoor pollution because there are few stories in the media on that.  That's the availability effect.  He should look at the stats.  13. Availability, Emotion, and Risk  * This is an Availability Cascade: a non-event that is inflated by the media until it fills the TV screens, and becomes the focus of everyone's chatter  14. Tom W's Specialty  * The lawn is well trimmed, the receptionist looks competent, and the furniture is solid, but this does Not mean it is a well managed company.  * They keep making the same mistake: predicting rare events from weak evidence.  When the evidence is weak, one should stick with the base rates / averages.  15. Linda: Less is More  * They constructed a very complicated scenario and insisted on calling it highly probable.  It is not -- it is only one plausible story.  * They added a cheap gift to the expensive product, and made the whole deal less attractive.  Less is more!  16. Causes Trump Statistics  * We cannot assume they will learn anything from mere statistics.  Let's show them one or 2 representative individual cases to influence their \\"quick\\" System 1.  * No need to worry about this statistical information being ignored.  On the contrary, it will immediately be used to feed a stereotype.  17.  Regression to the Mean  * She says experience has taught her that criticism is more effective than praise.  What she does not understand is that it's all due to regression to the mean.  * Our screening procedure is good but not perfect.  We should anticipate regression.  Don't be surprised if the very best candidates often fail to meet our expectations.  18. Taming Intuitive Predictions  * I read one review of that product and it was excellent.  Itmay have been a fluke.  Let's only consider products that have a large number of reviews, and pick the one that looks best.  PART THREE - OVERCONFIDENCE  19. The Illusion of Understanding  * The mistake appears obvious, but it is just hindsight.  You could not have known in advance.  * He's learning too much from this success story, which is too tidy.  He has fallen for a narrative fallacy.  * Let's not fall for the outcome bias.  This was a stupid decision, even though we got lucky and it worked out well.  20. The Illusion of Vanity  * She has a coherent story that explains all she knows, and the coherence makes her feel good.  * What makes him believe that he is smarter than the market?  Is this an illusion of skill?  21. Intuitions Vs. Formulas  * Whenever we can replace human intuition by a formula, we should at least consider it.  * He thinks his judgments are complex and subtle, but a simple combination of scores could probably do better  22. Expert Intuition: When Can We Trust It?  * How much expertise does she really have in this particular task?  How much practice has she had?  * She is very confident in her decision, but subjective confidence is a poor index of the accuracy of a judgment  23. The Outside View  * He's taking an inside view.  He should forget about his own case and look for what happened in other cases  * We are making an additional investment b/c we do not want to admit failure.  This is an instance of the sunk-cost fallacy.  * Suppose you knew nothing about this particular legal case, only that it involves a malpractice claim by individual vs surgeon.  What would be your baseline prediction?  How many succeed in court?  How many settle?  Is the case we are discussing stronger or weaker than similar claims?  24. The Engine of Capitalism  * They have an illusion of control  They seriously underestimate the obstacles.  * They seem to suffer from an acute case of competitor neglect.  * We should come up with a pre-mortem session.  Someone maycome up with a threat we have neglected.  PART FOUR - CHOICES  25.  Bernoulli's Errors  * He was very happy with a $20k bonus three years ago, but his salary has gone up, so he will need a higher bonus to get the same utility.  * Both candidates are willing to accept this salary, but they won't be equally satisfied, because their reference points are different.  She currently has a much higher salary.  * She's suing him for alimony.  She would prefer to settle, but he prefers to go to court.  Not surprising -- she can only only gain, so she's risk averse.  He faces options that are all bad, so he'd rather take the risk.  26. Prospect Theory  * He suffers from extreme loss aversion, which makes him turn down very favorable opportunities.  * Considering her vast wealth, her emotional response to trivial gains and losses makes no sense  * He weighs losses about twice as much as gains, which is normal.  27. The Endowment Effect  * She did not care which office she would get, but a day after the announcement, she was no longer willing to trade.  The endowment effect !  * He is a miser, and treats any dollar he spends as a loss.  * These negotiations are going nowhere, because both sides find it hard to make concessions, even when they get something in return.  Losses loom larger than gains.  28. Bad Events  * The reform will not pass.  Those who stand to lose will fight harder than those who stand to gain.  * Each of them thinks the other's concessions are less painful.  They are both wrong, of course, it's just he asymmetry of losses.  * Rental prices have gone up recently, but our tenants don't think it's fair that we should raise their rent, too.  They feel entitled to the current terms.  29. The Fourfold Pattern  * We never let our vacations hang on a last-minute deal.  We're willing to pay a lot for certainty.  * They will not cut their losses so long as there is any chance of breaking even.  This is risk-seeking in the losses.  * They know the risk of a gas explosion is minuscule, but they want it mitigated.  It's a possibility effect, and they want peace of mind.  * He is tempted to settle this frivolous claim to avoid a freak loss, however unlikely.  That's over-weighting of small probabilities.  Since his is likely to face many similar problems, he would be better off not yielding.  30. Rare Events  * Tsunamis are very rare, even in Japan, but the image is so vivid, that tourists are bound to overestimate their possibility.  * It's the familiar disaster cycle.  Begin by exaggeration and overweighting, then neglect sets in.  * We should not focus on a single scenario, or we'll overestimate its probability.  Let's set up specific alternatives and make the probabilities add up to 100%.  * They want people to be worried by the risk.  That's why they describe it as 1 death per 1,000.  They're counting on denominator neglect.  31. Risk Policies  * Tell he to think like a trader, you win a few, you lose a few.  * They never buy extended warranties.  That's their risk policy.  * Each of our executives is loss averse in his / her domain.  That's natural, but the result is that the organization is not taking enough risk.  * I only evaluate my portfolio once a quarter.  I am too loss averse to make sensible decisions in the face of daily price fluctuations.  32. Keeping Score  * He has separate mental accounts for cash and credit purchases.  I constantly remind him that money is money.  * We are hanging on that stock just to avoid closing our mental account at a loss.  Its' the disposition effect.  * We discovered an excellent dish  at that restaurant, and we never try anything else to avoid regret.  33. Reversals  * The BTU measurements meant nothing to me until I saw how much A/C units vary.  Joint evaluation was essential.  * It is often the case that when you broaden the frame, you reach more reasonable decisions.  * When you see cases in isolation, you are likely to be guided by an emotional reaction of System 1.  * You say thiswas an outstanding speech b/c you compared it to her other speeches.  Compared to others though, she was still inferior.  34. Frames and Reality  * They will feel better if they manage to frame the outcome in terms of how much money they kept rather than how much they lost  * Let's reframe the problem by changing the reference point.  Imagine we did not own it: how much would we think it is worth?  * Charge the loss to your mental account of \\"general revenue\\" -- you will feel better.  PART FIVE - TWO SELVES  35. Two Selves  * You are thinking of your failed marriage entirely from the perspective of the remembering self.  A divorce is like a symphony with a screeching sound at the end -- the fact that it ended badly does not mean it was all bad.  * This is a bad case of duration neglect.  You are giving the good and parts of your experience equal weight, although the good part lasted ten times longer.  36. Life as a Story  * He is trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.   * You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories.  Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if not very memorable.  37. Experienced Well-Being  * The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering.  We aim for a lower U-index in society.  Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.  * The easiest way to increase happiness is to control you use of time.  Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing ?  * Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasureable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.  38. Thinking About Life  * She thought that buying a fancy car would make her happier, but it turned out to be an error of affective forecasting.  * His car broke down on the way to work.  Not a good day to ask him about job satisfaction!  * Buying a larger house may not make use happier in thelong term.  We could be suffering from a focusing illusion.  * He has chosen to split his time between 2 cities.  Probably a serous case of mis-wanting.  Conclusions
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book! Well written and once again like the first two, I couldn't put it down.  Great author!! My son is now reading these books.
B004T0E2S8|4.0|i really wish that this app had a left handed mode in it. otherwise its' great, (if i was right-handed), but it would be nice if there was an option to do left handed mode in it.
B0055SWM08|3.0|Its ok. Nothing to jump and scream about but its a nice chill game that doesn't get progressively harder. Just okay.
0060873027|3.0|The premise is new and interesting; the book would have been stronger for MC's additional contribution had he not died before it was completed. Some physical attributes of the made-up world bothered me to distraction, but mostly the work was a good, entertaining and readable story. This isn't the Great American Novel--don't read it if that's all you can stand. If you want a fun escapist mid-winter read, I recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down!!!  twists and turns!!  Such s well written book!!!  Cant wait to read the next one!!! Love this author
B006E4QCXU|4.0|People who play with this for 30 seconds and delete it just don't have the patience or curiosity to really understand this app. I've been able to corral these dots into all kinds of interesting shapes, including ones resembling galaxies, flowers, bubble chamber tracks, a horse's head, and one that was a dead ringer for a tree stump, complete with roots and bark. Wish I could have saved those images and uploaded them to a site somewhere where people could share.  It's too slow to use in color on my Samsung Vibrant, but in B&W it's still tons of fun.
085738371X|5.0|I saw the movie \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" and thought what a great story! Found out it was the 1st book of a trilogy. Immediately ordered the box set. Read books 2 & 3. Could not put them down. What a great story throughout. All I could think was that it is a tragedy that the author, Steig Larrson, died so young. Highly recommend this trilogy! Can't wait for them to make a movie around book 2.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this Bible app. Its ready to search and find the passage wanted. I also like the option of changing the version of the Bible.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It has lots of games! I'm glad you buy gamed with the money you get. You can also unlock games. If you buy other games you can get more money. Also if you make a review you get money also.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|its realy cool to play with, but if this cant be a live wallpaper, whats the point? please add that feature and it would be 5 stars hands down.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I went to see this movie and was absolutely astonished on how HORRIBLE it was. I was at least expecting something better than the first one, but it was even worse! It's like they didn't even try! You would have to pay me to watching this movie again! Don't waste your money and buy this terrible movie.
B006PAZMMK|3.0|This is an ok album and l think dubstep is a cool style of electronic music but I think here in America people get easily overrated by younger crowds (Justin Bieber).I am a huge fan of electronic music and I am very open to many of it's forms including dubstep. Skrillex's Bangarang is the first all dubstep album I have purshased. I know there are probably some real dope dubstep artists out  there but I chose Skrillex as my first album. This I did because I hear Skrillex hype everywhere. I expected a great album because of his hype! I never even botherd to youtube his songs, but after listening I didn't go back to listen to it a second time in a row like I do when l love an album. Instead I switched to some much anticipated drum & bass!! So....the album is not that great because while I was listening, I kept saying, \\"Any electronic music artist can do that!!!!\\" and \\"He's just doing whatever!!!\\" And when I was REALLY enjoying a track I asked \\"Thats it!!?? It's over(\\"Kyoto\\")!!?? On a positive side,the last song \\"Summit\\" was what made me give it that extra star. Not bad for a chillout tune! But there are definitley better artists out there who deliver more than the sizzle, in this case, I got less steak!
0553386794|3.0|Unlike a lot of the people who have enjoyed this series, I cannot. This first book opens with eight different POV's and as the series continues the number of POV's increase (dragon's has 18 POV). Of these 8 PoV's, I cared for 3. To be honest, after the first 100 pages, I just started skipping the people I couldn't give a crap about and read Jon's, Ayra's and Ned's stories through to completion before even bothering with the rest.<br />I will say that I did finish this book, even though a good 60% of it bored the heck out of me. Martin's writing is engaging when you care about the character. This would be a good thing but I didn't really care about the majority of them anyways. Most of the characters that I disliked have many annoying qualities of different stereotypes all rolled into one character that just made me hate them. Sasha for one: raised by the Starks so you would think she would have a decent outlook on life. Nope, she is just a royal prat. Along with this she is that annoying horrible sister, the annoying I'm-so-in-love-with-a-guy-who-doesn't-like-me-but-I'm-too-daft-to-figure-that-out and the teenage girl persona we all like to see get killed in horror films. I have no idea where Martin was going with her but I just can't care about someone who is just so annoying I don't even want to read about her. And he does this with a bunch of characters!<br />Now if each of these characters had a little more time as a lead on paper, maybe it wouldnt have been so bad and I would have grown to like them(Sasha) but with 8 characters and only 864 pages to fit them into (about 108 pages per character) none of them get the time to shine.<br />Now for Martin's treatment of the girl across the sea, that is just wrong, discusting and I had a hard time reading it. thankfully it was brief and it is one of the reasons I won't read another one of these books. Insest, Pedophilia... really? Fine, add it into the book but you know what, I really don't want to have to witness it. Say it happened? thats okay. Make me read it as it happens, not fine. Its not hot its just discusting.<br />The reason I did give the book 3 stars was Jon's story and Ned's story. The only two really worth reading. Personally, if he had written two series, one FOCUSING only on Jon and one only on Ned, now those would have been worth the read. Jon's story really doesn't even involve the rest of the world or even need to. so why is it even there?<br />Ned's story was also awesome. political? yep but if he had continued it, it could have been even better than the A Song of Ice and Fire.<br />So overall:<br />You like Multiple POV's?<br />You like unnecessary deaths?<br />You Like struggles with no gain?<br />You like explicit sex *cough* rape *cough* scenes?<br />Then this series is for you.<br />If not, don't read it. It starts off where Jordan and Goodkind got to with their 5th books. Too many characters to actually care about to read the book.<br />The writing is good though (hence the extra stars)ened? thats okay. Make me read it as it happens, not fine. Its not hot its just discusting.  The reason I did give the book 3 stars was Jon's story and Ned's story. The only two really worth reading.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|From beginning to the end of this movie, you laugh, cry and search your own memories of \\"the way it used to be\\" and wonder how much has really changed in our society. I think everyone over the age of 18 should see this.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good time killer. It's a good take on the classic game of solitaire and it's easy to play. Good game.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|I've a nice little app, but like others have said, it's good for about 30 seconds, them out gets old. It's very nice, but now that I've played with it for a few minutes and I &quot;get it,&quot; I'm done. I played with it on a tablet, so it's bigger, but still doesn't hold my interest.

B006E4QCXU|5.0|It's a beautiful app, works great on my HTC Inspire. But I don't recommend you play it while driving. Funny thing happens. You start getting mezmerized. Next thing you know, you've entered like a twilight zone or something...and you go thru this tunnel...and the GPS doesn't seem to be working here, so I'm not really sure how to get back...<br /><br />Ummm...Superman?
B0000029GA|2.0|When you advertise illmatic, the original cd you should be selling the the original cd. Not the 10 year anniversary of the cd. Not cool man. Besides the fact that the extra tracks are dope you did me dirty yo.... not cool

B005G4TJUC|1.0|Why did I buy this thing? Well, I saw a preview and it was great. Make no mistakes, is a good movie if you like machines beating up humans without the humans being make into jelly.  The opening was the best in the world. If they had only kept it that way... But no. It desintegrated into pieces. The FXs were fabulous, but you can't make a whole movie out of that.  Sorry fans. I was disappointed, but then I'm not a kid anymore, so that's probably the reason.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I saw this movie in the theaters, simply put it's terrible. Do not waste your time even renting it, garbage.

1603420398|5.0|I am a fairly new at crochet and I was looking for a book of motifs to combine to make bed throws and this is just exactly what I was looking for!  It has a spiral binding for ease of keeping it at your page, a great selection of motifs, (with a colour photo of each) and there are circles, hexagons, triangles, squares and others. It is suitable for anyone from beginner to someone who has been crocheting for years and wants a selection of motifs at the ready. The ONLY thing that would have really been nice would have been some PHOTOS OF FINISHED PROJECTS rather than some drawings of what they suggested you can do with the motifs. Other than that, I LOVE it and I am now off to buy some more by the same author.  It's summer where I live, so I have a head start on winter and am going to be madly crocheting throws for several months until the cold sets in. Very happy! I would highly recommend this book- it's simple, straightforward, full of useful information and presented in a highly user-friendly format. What more could you want? (more books by the same author, that's what)
B005529EI2|5.0|Love Lord of the Rings. It's awesome that it's so convenient to rent movies now online and that the extended version of this movie is available.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|It seems like Hollywood is running out of ideas. The animation wasn't as good as other movies I have seen, the plot was really awful, felt recycled. Completely not worth the price and hopefully they don't make a sequel. I want my 100 minutes back!

B006OT03BM|5.0|I was hesitating big time with this set, I was gonna get it at best buy but they wanted a $149.99 so  i said screw it let me get it here<br />and wow unbelieveable price beautiful set I have to call amazon because the tape seem to have screwed my dark moon and the other blu ray movies, it left a tape stain and it either plays or it does'nt the signed bay sig is a real sweet touch and the film strips, i would def recommend this even if u dont love all the movies or have them seperately, In my opinion the signed plaque with bays sig and the film strips is worth the $89 in my opinion and they actually put a wrap to cover the plaque and sig

B005WZZRD8|4.0|I would have given it a 5 stars, but the packaging lousy for what is suppose to be a \\"collection\\". Other then that it is a good value on amazon.com for $25. $30-$35 on other websites. Twice as much if you buy each item separately.  I love Lady Gaga so that's why I bought this.

1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson has done tremendous service to people all over the world by bringing truth about most fascinating personality of the century. This is the first book of this size ever I read cover to cover. I had hard time putting it down and going to bed every night for couple of weeks. Almost every chapter has something about Steve that made me cry. Sure he was moody, rude, shrued  businessman but at the same time he was creative geneous, who inspired people around him. Most of all he was a synthesisor. Not just that he integrated science, technology, art, music but he made computers so easy to learn for anyone. This book gives detail accounts of his struggles to bring his vision, ideas into reality. I admire Steve and his courage for going with this book idea to bring only the truth in front of people. No doubt he was successful when he was alive, he is successful even after his death. Look forward to seeing a long movie based on this book, his life, hopefully made by Ron Howard and his role played by Noah Wyle.<br /><br />I read this first time in hurry, as if gobbled it. So many names to remember. I watched many video clips and when I saw those faces and connected with the names made so much sense. Now I am over halfway through the book reading slowly second time around. I pretty much memorized Jobs whole life. Sometimes I feel like almost caught into his reality distortion field. If he is so powerful even after his death, without even ever seeing him in person, wonder how it must be working with him.
B000X107GI|5.0|After checking the reviews, I was hesitating in ordering this item. They shipped the item quickly and to my surprise it worked perfectly. The 2 CR 2032 battery cost $6.99 in Walgreens. I think this is the best price you can get for this item.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I don't know what it is about this movie but I just can't get enough of watching it.  I finally gave in and purchased it after watching it every time it came on the tv, now I don't have to deal with the commercials.  The actors performance and the attention to detail for that time period are fantastic, it draws you into what it must have been like to live back then.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this...keeps me in the Word and I have it with me anywhere I go.  I also like the topical readings.  They've been very helpful.
1416594787|5.0|This book was amazing! A must read for anybody that has ever felt like they needed to defend modern science against irrational theists.<br /><br />The beginning was very readable and it felt like having a conversation or a personal science lesson with Richard Dawkins. It slowly got more complex but no less interesting or readable. His adoration for Darwin's work begins to really show near the end.<br /><br />He also identifies many of the classic creationist arguments, if you can call them that, against evolution. He addresses the fact that such a large amount of Americans, and a growing number of British, have been fooled into thinking there is a controversy concerning evolution.<br /><br />Wonderful book. I recommend it to everyone.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|\\"Here she comes walkin down the street...\\"; \\"These boots were made for walkin...\\" Lana Del Rey has arrived amongst a firestorm of both positive and negative attention. As easy as it would have been to slag her, I couldn't, the music speaks slowly, clearly, sadly and beautifully.<br /><br />To fully understand the artist, here's a quick quiz: What does Lana Del Rey have in common with the following list? Elizabeth Grant; The Strokes; Nancy Sinatra; David Lynch; Leonard Cohen; Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star; Cat Power; Forties/sixties Hollywood; Angelina Jolie; modern production.<br /><br />Answers: Elizabeth Grant is her real name (For those of you who have a problem with this check with Bob Dylan, Elton John, Joe Strummer, Elvis Costello etc.) The Strokes: Fellow east coasters from upper class background who produce excellent music. Leonard Cohen: writes and sings sadly beautiful ballads. Hope Sandoval and Mazzy Star; Cat Power: see Leonard Cohen. Also, Cat Power, not her real name. Nancy Sinatra: An influence. David Lynch: Her music/videos have the same twisted feel. Forties/sixties Hollywood: Her look; contrived, yes...but it works. Angelina Jolie:LIPS Modern production: used on Born To Die.<br /><br />Now, to the proper review...<br /><br />Born To Die is a lush, sweeping album of meloncholic beauty. Not convinced? Listen to Video Games. Other stellar tracks include Born To Die and Blue Jeans. Her sound works best when it goes from slow to slower. There's a sadness that filters through Lana's smokey voice. The arrangements enhance this effect. Radio is the best track: a swirling mixture of fluid production and searing emotion<br /><br />Lana del Rey has recieved both positive and negative attention in varying measures. The future will determine her impact on popular music. I'm going all in and placing my bet on Ms. Del Rey (Grant). Cream rises...

B000JIHP88|4.0|The mobile holds my 2 month old son's attention.  The basic colors make it easy for him to see, as he prefers to look the lights for the contrast.  The mobile has 2 volumes, both of which  fairly quiet (especially the rainforest sounds).  The length of time it plays is sufficient, not too long or too short. I would recommend this mobile for young babies, since it seems to have helped develop my son's focus and eye contact.

B004G600A4|5.0|Finally! Disney is back with a vengeance... eh, I mean, a princess! This is the great come back of Walt Disney Animation Studios to the classical fairy tales, which made the happiness of so many children since \\"White Snow\\" sang that first song... My daughter absolutely loved \\"Tangled\\" and I liked it at least as much, for all the reasons mentioned in the title:<br /><br />1. Princess Rapunzel - together with \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" in 2009, this is the return of Disney Princesses after a long leave of absence, and Rapunzel is certainly a great success. Her magic hair gives of course a great show but Rapunzel herself is the real star. Having spend all her life in a tower she is quite naive and can even seem simple, but her charm and courage are simply irresistible. The scene in which she handles alone a whole tavern full of mercenaries, rogues, brigands and other scum of the earth is a great moment of cinema!<br /><br />2. Flynn Rider, the thief - he is an extremely likable scoundrel, a perfect mix of Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and Douglas Fairbanks Jr Thief of Baghdad, with just a little something of Han Solo and Captain Jack Sparrow (just younger than both of them). It can seem an unlikely choice to make a thief in the hero of a child story, but Flynn Rider is hardly a real criminal, more like a wannabee - and for all his past misdeeds he is going to be seriously punished in this movie and will have ample occasion to redeem himself... He is also certainly a irresistibly charming character.<br /><br />3. Humor - well, other than Rapunzel's pet chameleon who loves stick his tongue in people's ears, humor is provided by shovels in almost every scene and by almost every character in the movie - but mostly by the brilliant dialogs between Rapunzel and Flynn. Grown ups will find this movie almost certainly as entertaining as children. And mind this frying pan!<br /><br />4. Horse power - I kept the best for the end. Maximus the horse is absolutely the greatest character in the whole movie! As promised on the poster this is a noble steed who can do everything, including sword fighting! In fact the more we progress through the movie, the more we realize that Maximus is in fact.. but no! I am not telling you anything more about him! If you missed this movie in the cinema, you deserve to discover everything about Maximus the horse by yourself!<br /><br />To conclude, this movie is a wonder! Great job Walt Disney Animation Studios and let's hope that their next movies will keep the same quality level!poster this is a noble steed who can do everything, including sword fighting!

0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult, a brilliant author who has sold 18 bestselling novels. Her skillful writing makes this particular book a delight to read! Written in 2004, this story about a girl like no other is 423 pages long with no illustrations.   In the state of Rhode Island, this story is set in 2004. The novel revolves around a exceptional 13-year-old named Anna Fitzgerald, who was conceived with the sole purpose of saving her older sister, Kate. Then there is her older sister, Kate, who suffers from acute promyelocytic leukemia, a rare blood and bone marrow cancer. Brian and Sara Fitzgerald are two parents who are struggling to accept the fact that they might lose their oldest daughter. Leading up to the peak of the story, drama, grief, heartbreak, forgiveness, sadness, anger, and most importantly, love, generate depressing yet affectionate tones.   My Sister's Keeper is about a 13-year-old girl named Anna Fitzgerald. Anna is not your typical teenager. Most teenagers spend their time hanging out with their friends, where as Anna spends a majority of her time at the hospital. Anna was conceived solely to save her sister Kate. Anna enlists the help of an attorney, Campbell Alexander, to sue her parents for the rights of her own body, because the last procedure Anna has been asked to do is to donate a kidney, which will put her life at stake.   After much pain and suffering to the Fitzgerald family, the novel peaks a climax during the ongoing lawsuit, when Anna finally decides to take the stand, against the wishes of her lawyer. She then reveals the true reason she made the decision to file a lawsuit in the first place. The last chapter holds some very shocking revelations, and will have you at the edge of your seat.   Teenagers and adults of any age who like drama novels about family and love will be grateful for this novel. However, if you are not a fan of sad stories, do not read this book. If you are looking for a feel good book with a happy ending, this is not the book for you. But if you start to read it, don't be surprised when you can't set it down. It's an excellent read.

B0058EBNAO|4.0|I am a migraine sufferer and believe that sometimes they are triggered by changes in barometric pressure. This app is a great tool for tracking the pressure and if I have a migraine.

B001MIVTVS|4.0|The recording quality on this edition of the 2-album set seems fine to me, it sounds just like my original vinyl without all the hiss and scratches. As others have mentioned these were originally two fairly different albums that were released simultaneously and, yet, at the same time released together in an elaborate cardboard boxed set with a marvelous full-color lyric and picture book. Too bad they couldn't include that in this CD, but I guess the publication rights to it are not available.<br /><br />As for the music... While I have every Donovan album, this is still one of my all time favorites, because it encapsulates that oft-mentioned and seldom found 'one brief shining moment' in time that so many people experienced between 1966 and 1968 during a period of social transition. I have no idea if those who weren't there will like this music (heck, it was a bit much even for some who were there at the time). In one way it is utterly timeless and in another it is quaintly dated. Days of the future passed. If you remember at all, then you should listen to it again, just to check in. If you are at all curious about the concept, you should give it a try as well... but you should probably start with the two albums that preceded it: SUNSHINE SUPERMAN and MELLOW YELLOW so you have a frame of reference.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|This was our book club choice for January, and I was not disappointed.  Many reviewers have noted how they found the timing confusion, but it is not such a major issue to disrupt your reading.<br />Although I find love-at-first-sight stories too far fetched, I've read many people's comments saying they loved that aspect of this book.  I loved the innocence of the young characters, the development of the circus structure, and how the author intertwined all the characters for the plot \\"twists.\\"<br />I can understand why this title is so popular right now.  Now I can't wait to hear the other members of our book club say what they think.

0553381695|5.0|A Clash of Kings begins right where A Game of Thrones ends. Robb Stark has declared himself King of the North, while his mother Catelyn tries to make peace between Stannis and Renly Baratheon, each of whom has proclaimed himself King of the Seven Kingdoms, plunging Westeros deeper into civil war. In King's Landing, Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne, but his mother Cersei rules the realm, at least until Tyrion Lannister arrives to be the new Hand of the King. Sansa Stark remains Cersei's hostage, while Arya, travels with one of the Black Brothers and a band of misfits and thieves in route to The Wall. Jon Snow, meanwhile, has joined the rangers of the Night's Watch in search of the Wildlings and their king, Mance Rayder. While back at Winterfell, Bran and his brother Rickon face an unexpected enemy. And a continent away, Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons seek an army to take back the kingdoms her family once ruled.<br /><br />It quickly becomes apparent that this book is the start of the lengthy, middle portion of the series. Few, if any, storylines are resolved, though the conflict and tension are ratcheted up several notches from A Game of Thrones. This novel is also darker than its predecessor, though perhaps that's to be expected as the stakes continue to rise.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of nine different viewpoint characters (not counting the prologue), which is one more point-of-view than A Game of Thrones. The book is long enough, however, to give every storyline it's due. With one exception (whose name I won't reveal to avoid a *spoiler*), I truly felt for these characters. I cared about what happened to Arya Stark and her brother Bran, and Jon Snow beyond The Wall. I empathized with Catelyn Stark, worrying for her children, and found myself rooting for Tyrion Lannister, surrounded by treachery in King's Landing. (I must admit, the Lannisters are one of the most sublime group of villains I've encountered in a long time!) And I couldn't help put pull for Daenerys and her dragons, even though I know that if they ever return to the Seven Kingdoms, bad things may happen to the other characters I've come to adore. In short, Martin's masterful portrayal of these characters is perhaps his greatest gift. It's also the primary reason his novels work so well.aenerys and her dragons, even though I know that if they ever return to the Seven Kingdoms, bad things may happen to the other characters I've come to adore.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I have a 1986 Honda Goldwing that is in like new shape. The radio is part of the fairing and not easily replaced. It is AM/FM/Cassette. I bought a cassette adapter that would alow me to plug in a CD player. Then I found the Sound Fly. I didn't know they made such devices. It really will work great on the bike. Much better than the CD player I was planning on. It uses an SD card or USB flash drive in FAT32 format and you can load just about unlimited music on in different files. Just a rough check, I had it hooked up to a small 12V hobby battery and I got over a city block range out of it which is a supprise. The xmit can be programed to use just about any frequency in the entire FM band and has a memory to store 4 frequencys. It has all kinds of nice features and I like it a lot. Well worth the money and will be great for my bike. The only thing I might change would be to make the unit itself independant of the cig lighter plug.
0439023513|3.0|I have to say with the buildup to the finale I was completely disappointed in this novel from pretty much the first chapter.  Katniss proves she's nothing but a fighter in this novel and does not have a brain she should be able to function with.  To point out every flaw in this novel would be to give spoilers that many would not want.  But I will tell you that the ending of this novel resolved pretty much nothing and was completely unsatisfying.  In the first two novels Katniss misses a lot of the action going on, which is understandable considering her circumstances.  The action she misses in this particular novel is used only so the author would not have to write it.  There are two huge scenes that are only glossed over because Katniss is out of it.  What kind of shoddy writing is that at the end of a novel?  If you can not write solid action scenes, or the other scene which I will not say, then you still need to do better than the horrid glossing.  It flew with the first two novels, in this one it was nothing more than a cop-out.  Horrid ending, but the writing was still good.  I struggled with this novel.  I raved about the first two and wanted to throw the third out a high window.  It dragged in many places then glossed important things.  I hope in Collins' next series she learns from this mistake.

0307474259|5.0|I read this book in April 2011.  I followed the advice for the next 10 months.  The only thing I did was to swap the rice, bread, pasta with vegetables and eat more protein (including protein shake).  Nothing spectacular happened overnight.  However, I lost average of 2 lbs per month.  Over the the 10 month period, I lost 20 lbs off my 165lb/5'9\\" frame.  I trimmed off 2 sizes off my pants.  The advice from this book works.  It is a healthy, slow way of gradually loosing your weight and keeping it off.  Try it but keep a long horizon.  You didn't gain all that extra weight overnight so don't expect it to come off in a month's time.  Keep the discipline and you'll see good result.

B000JIHP88|5.0|This is the only mobile I have tried so I have nothing to compare it to but I definitely won't be shopping for anything else.  I was looking for something to keep my 6 week old son entertained while getting use to his crib because every time I put him in there he would cry.  The mobile did much more for my son than I expected.  He will lay in the crib and watch the mobile at night until he falls asleep.  I think it is the movement of the leaves that keeps his attention because the motion is large enough for him to focus on at this young age.  Overall this is a great product and I am thrilled that it helps him (and me) sleep!!
B003L77GRO|5.0|I already had seasons 1-4. I needed season 5 to complete my set (until other seasons come out, of course). I havent started season 5 just yet. But I plan on starting it with in the next couple of weeks and i cant wait. Dexter is the best show ever!! I LOVE IT!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It's a good sharpener, but only if you don't want to carry a grinding stone, otherwise a grinding stone is really much better than this. It's useful to sharpen small blades, but if it's a very blunt knife you're going to have a bit of trouble sharpening it, it'll take some time.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|If you love suspenseful shows/movies or zombie movies of course, then you will love this series. It's awesome! I just HAD to own it.

1593080255|4.0|This cover art features a portrait of an unknown, bearing no resemblance to the blonde Dorian in Wilde's novel.<br /><br />My parents kept a page of chapel sayings from Bob Jones Sr. on our refrigerator for many years.  Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born.  Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said:  \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"<br /><br />Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper.  So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)<br /><br />What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history.  As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library.  I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.<br /><br />Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes.  Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity.  As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.<br /><br />I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences.  One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"<br /><br />But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters.  There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.<br /><br />The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedy [[ASIN:B002WPFH9K Ramona (Signet Classics)]] , by Helen Hunt Jackson.  I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey.  Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty.ce.\\"  But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters.

B0060FXBNM|5.0|We haven't actually watched the movie yet but we've seen it multiple times. I opened the packaging to make sure it wasn't scratched. It was fine.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|Great remote, I've been using it for about 3 weeks now, no problems whatsoever! Would highly recommend to any Xbox style remote lover, its almost exactly the same.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|An app that is relaxing and works well on the KF - especially in color.  I do like the demo being in video format, rather than photos.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Surprisingly addictive and mesmerizing. Looks great on the Motorola ATRIX.  Definitely recommend. Too bad I can't &quot;record&quot; it as a live wallpaper.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|Comes up to an empty, black screen that no amount of adjustment will change. If it had only refused to allow me to uninstall it, it would have been a perfect Sartrean drama. Hell is other people's apps!
0439023521|5.0|this book (first off i read the whole series) is by far the best book ive ever read. so much action adventure and drama. i love love love suzanne collins way of writting so breath taking i was drawn to the book by the firs page. you are dum not to order this amazing book which is great for all ages. like me  im very young and my teacher whos 50 read this and he loved it ever one i know has read it and without a doubt they loved them. and its better than twilight. i hated the twilight series and it was so predictable and now they have to make breaking dawn 2 parts thats dum. i believe the storyline and charecters were more better than twilights and im team Peeta all the way. but back to the book its the best and everyone should read it.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00023BLXK|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted this movie till I saw the trailer. It isn't a bad movie after all. I enjoyed it even more knowing that it is coming from a true story.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|It's a cool app to waste time. I can see where it will become very addicting.   The negative about this app   You cant save what you make
B002VPE1WK|5.0|have looked at multiple backpacks and finally chose this one. very happy i did. has lots of adjustable cubbies for multiple lenses and filters. also plenty of space for manuels and other thing you may need to carry. happy with product
0765365278|4.0|I've read a fair bit of Brandon Sanderson's work, including his Mistborn Novels, Warbreaker and his collaboration with the late Robert Jordan (I say collaboration since Mr Jordan did leave a lot of material and direction for his books). It's fair to say that the quality of the writing has improved from series to series. The ideas and creativity of the worlds Mr. Sanderson invents are improving as well, with the world that this novel and series will take place in, Roshar, being one of the more original settings I've read in recent times. Don't look for cows, sheep, deer etc. The closest thing to this world that you might find is in the intertidal zone at your local beach, except substitute wind for waves as the defining element shaping the environment. It's interesting and quite original I would say. It's quite possible to get absorbed in studying the world itself, and the excellent art work included in the book helps the flavour a lot.  The magic system in this world, such as it is, is also quite interesting and original, and includes a fusion of technology which helps the flavour and believability.  That having been said, the three focus characters in the book vary considerably in their appeal, IMHO. Kaladin, the surgeon's son, who leaves a promising medical career to join the army to protect his younger brother is engaging. His personal character does undergo development as the story unfolds. You can't place him in any of the generic fantasy categories. for example, \\"heroic farmboy discovers he is the focus of the world's well-being\\", or \\"shining paladin who adheres to nobility even amidst the corruption of society\\". He's quite easy to like and empathise with, even if he does have power that renders him practically invincible, so long as his \\"mana battery\\" so to speak, if fully charged. Don't hesitate to empathise, get involved with and like this character. Unlike some of the major characters in some other works (I'm looking at you, George R.R. Martin), I doubt very much Kaladin is in any danger of dying midway through the series.  Dalinar, the uncle of the land of Alethkar's king, is easier to put into a generic category (see shining paladin, above). A man of strong principles and conviction, he is willing to sacrifice for the greater good. Even amidst his angst and the challenges he faces, you never doubt that he will rise to the occasion and do the right thing. He's easy to like, but maybe not so easy to believe, in such a ruthless and cut throat world.  Shallan, the third focus character, does have some ties to the main story, but her part is somewhat underwritten, probably to be more focused on in future novels. She's a nice enough girl, even with her impure motives, so I shall withold judgement of her until I've read at least 2 more books in the series. Since she is the source of some of the fine art work shown throughout the book though, I've no real complaints about her.  All in all, I would recommend this book to the majority of fantasy readers. It's easy to read and engaging. It didn't \\"rock my world\\" like Book 1 of the Wheel of Time, or Book 1 of a Song of Ice and Fire, but it is of better quality than most of the fantasy genre books I've read recently. I do suggest you pick it up if you enjoy a good read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works well and does what its intended to do. Nice graphics also. It also features a nice map with time lapse.
B0063IH60K|4.0|sometimes the simpler a game is, the more enjoyable it can be. if you want something to occupy you for five minutes that's mildly challenging then this game should satisfy!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this App!!! There is only one thing that I do not like about it... There's not a search option (at least that I could find) But other wise it is wonderful!!! I love having my Bible at my fingertips where ever I go!!!
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I've always admired PD James (still do) so I looked forward to her take on Jane Austen's world.  To date I've avoided most of the other imitators/sequels but I made an exception for PD James.  Unfortunately I did not find that PD James' somewhat heavy and brooding style married well with the original P&P.  And yet, from the first line you see that the author did intend to take the original as a model.  The language or sentence consruction might match but the style didn't.  It was disconcerting to see Elizabeth and Darcy burdened with angst, without the refreshing ironic self-awareness of the original.  In PD James' vision, as they grey older, their awareness grew darker.  I prefer the original P&P along with earlier PD James' mysteries that use her style to more appropriate affect.
B006HH5Y6K|2.0|I remembered liking this album in the early 70s when it was released, so I bought the CD.  Tastes change, including mine.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Does what it promises and does it very good and in a very intuitive way. I use it daily to see what to wear to office and plan activities.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|okay I had no idea that this game ever exited intill I found it on the free app of the day for the kindle fire
B006E4QCXU|5.0|it is pretty cool to see stars like that on a screen.  I can see how it is in space on a screen .
B004A8ZX28|2.0|I thought this movie was just \\"okay\\" - in other words if you don't see it, you aren't missing anything.<br /><br />It was basically annoying that they couldn't come up with proof/confirmation after his identity had been stolen -- its explained later but it didn't make the annoyance any less annoying.  Totally not a new story line.<br /><br />There was absolutely nothing new about this script - its basic cookie cutter stuff.  No great lines, no great acting, no great stunts, no surprises, no value -- just more of the same old stuff.<br /><br />PS: Liam (if you ever read this), you did the best you could with this, it's not your fault. You just didn't have much to work with.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing game keep up the good workvi love it love it love it love it love it. the reason I love it is.because you get to pick what game you want to play
B002ZG994U|4.0|I was a big fan of \\"The A Team\\" TV series (though not of Mr T), so it really pleased me to see they did a FANTASTIC job resurrecting it with this movie.<br /><br />Well done!  You get all the good stuff the TV series had, and maybe done a little better.  It has zaniness with crazy Murdock, wit, cunning, plenty of action and thrills and of course 'the plan coming together'.  This movie does not disappoint!! Very enjoyable! [And Quinton Jackson is a MUCH better B.A. than Mr T]<br /><br />PS - be sure to watch for the clip at the end of the credits
B006C45CFG|2.0|I thought it was dumb.  You might want to rent it on Netflix but don't expect much from this less than average attempt at a sci-fi movie.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I've tried several office suite apps either as free trials or FAOTD downloads and this one is by far the best and the only one I'd recommend as a full price purchase.  It seems to handle documents better than other programs.  I even use it to view PDFs because it's better than the Adobe standalone PDF app.<br /><br />Editing documents and spreadsheets is never going to be easy on a smartphone but this makes it as painless as possible without sacrificing too many features.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I finally got this piece of junk app to start working with my PC after 45mins of messing with setting for my firewall, antivirus, and windows media player. Only to find out I downloaded my entire song purchase 3 times (like 150 songs)---guess what!? I cannot remove songs!!! So I have to download 450 songs to get my 150 songs, piece of crap!! Yeah it was my fault for clicking to download my queue 3 times while trouble shooting, but no choice to stop downloading, or remove songs. SUCKTASTIC, MORONIC, SIMPLISTIC, GARBAGE! Plus I read a lot of the other negative reviews, and they seem to be accurate. I only give it 2 stars because right now technically speaking it is working (and I have a 9mbs connection) SO it's only going to waste a few hours of my time.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|On first run I has a real \\"WTH\\" moment with this thing.  The optimize settings feature ran and presented me with a grid of white dots.  Apparently the Galaxy S is too slow for anything more complicated by its logic.  When it's not in color, it's really, really dumb.  But after tinkering with the settings for a while, I did come to realize the potential of this program.  Unfortunately, at that point it went from being really, really dumb to just really dumb.<br /><br />If there were some sort of automated hands free option and/or the ability to make it a live wallpaper, it might be worth something.  But even as a FAOTD the Zen potential just isn't great enough to keep around.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|This movie was ridiculously bad. I wanted to shoot myself after watching this movie... Please shut down this move NOW! I find it offensive in every manner...  If you value your children in any way, avoid this movie at all costs! Oh yeah, sup MPAA.
B004HZ76FQ|3.0|This game was much more fun and involving that it should be.  It makes full use of all the sensors your phone or tablet has and it really hits the balance between to simple and too complex.  Unfortunately it did lock up/force close a few times during my initial uses so I wound up uninstalling it.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|First off I would give this film a B+ if the option were available as 4 stars is a tad too generous.  I am not going to add anything that has already been described as far as details but I have to say I actually appreciated the movie for what it is not - Thank God this was not some big dumb car chase movie ala Fast and Furious or your typical big loud summer generic cgi infested summer action fest.  The film does not contain any thing new but does a good job providing a fresh perspective for the various genres represented in the film.  I enjoyed the fact that Ryan Gosling's character did not speak much.  I thought the soundtrack and background music was fresh and reminded me of John Carpenter's work with synthesizers.  I had no problem with the \\"slow\\" pace described by some, as the film was intense and gripping.  This was one of the most unpredictable films I can remember watching.  I did not like, however, the over indulgence of violence - I thought it cheapened the film and dumbed it down.  The film was a little long too.  As far as some of the loose ends in the film, I had no problems for this type of film.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Really interesting to watch the physics as you build 'gravity' around different areas of the screen, and the random color change is a nice touch.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|I remember having this on VHS - they did a pretty good job with the quality on blu-ray.  I needed it because I had T2 on blu-ray and it just didn't look right with out the original.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Pretty good. Only issue I have with it is it does not have a high replayablity. Glad its free today because its not with $2
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Admittedly this is one of my favorite movies.  To see it on blu-ray makes it even better!  The special effects look great, and the entire time watching it I forgot how bad a governor he was.
B0040JHLJA|5.0|After all these years of running with shint splints I may have found the answer! I use to be in the Army and didn't develop shint splint until the very end of my contract. Let me just say PT tests were brutal but I always managed really good times. Now I wonder how much better my times could have been if I had found these shoes. Truly a great purchase for me.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Well this app is NOT for ones that get motion sickness. But its pretty cool even though I will not keep it I could not give it less then four stars I like it just can't watch it makes me sick. Glad I tried it and now have it for later use. Besides it Free!!!
B0000691U1|5.0|Merci le colis est arrive ce matin en bon état, mais il me semble ques les frais d'expedition ont beaucoup augmenté, Pourquoi ?
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I like to watch this when I am feeling out of sorts, as it is such a beautiful rendition of one of my favorite people's work.  I especially liked Eric Clapton's performance and comments, as well as Paul McCartney's comment about \\"with Dhani being up here it's like we all got old and George stayed young.\\"  You could also see that Paul was visibly moved by the whole experience.  When the crowd clapped and went \\"ga-ga\\" over him (Paul), he just made a motion to cut it.  I took that as his meaning that this isn't about me, but George.  I didn't care much for the Monty Python act, and wondered what all the Indian musicians thought about the somewhat obscene performance.  I thought Anoshka's version of one of my favorite \\"George\\" songs, \\"The Inner Light\\" was absolutely stellar.  This song is very hard to find and is on an old tape of mine called The Beatles \\"Rarities.\\"  All things considered, the love that these people had for George was absolutely palpable, and as Ravi Shankar said, \\"George's presence is here with us now.\\"  All and all, this was excellent.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Wow, I really have to take the time to type this out, when the title sums up everything that needs to be said.  I give it 4 stars because it's not practical for me.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I love this app! It's very relaxing and fun. I highly recommend it. Especially as the FAOTD it's a steal.
0439023521|5.0|awesome book, the 1st book is still my fav. in the trilogy. Katniss is a wonderful character and the world she lives in, although set in a different time, is so easy to understand and connect to. This book may sound far fetched but it is written in such a way that you can relate to it. Katniss is great as she can be so hard, but you know that underneath it she is a good person. Absolutely gripping, I read this book because someone on one of these suggested it, I am still trying to find something that tops it! Definitely my all time favorite book, no competition.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|For free, this is a great toy for playing around with forces on particle like graphics.  I could see this as a ad based app as long as the ad goes away (such as a splash screen.)
B004GHYCKW|5.0|English singer PJ Harvey released her new album \\"Let England Shake\\" in early 2011,. However, it was done so on a new label. It was her first project on Vagrant Records after a nearly 20 year association with Island Records. On this new album, she produces the album with her longtime collaborators John Parish (who she collaborated with on the album \\"A Man A Woman Walked By\\" in 2009), Flood (who produced two of Harvey's earlier albums- 1995's \\"To Bring You My Love\\" and 1998's \\"Is This Desire?\\") and Mick Harvey- who isn't related to PJ. On this new album, she decides to mellow things out and tell the story of her native homeland. A native of England, she retells the story of her country and the wars that endured that made it what it is in the present day.<br /><br />She starts the album off with the somber title track \\"Let England Shake\\", while leading into \\"The Last Living Rose\\"- a song sung from the perspective of a prisoner of war. On the percussive driven \\"The Glorious Land\\", it reflects on the numerous adults and children killed in the middle of battle in Afghanistan. The songs \\"The Words That Maketh Murder\\"  and \\"All And Everyone\\" talks about the horrors of war from the point of view from a soldier. \\"In The Dark Places\\" gives an account of the daily methods of the young English soldiers, while the people try to recover from the violence in their city on the song \\"Written On The Forehead\\". PJ closes the album with \\"The Colour Of The Earth\\", where a person remembers a friend who lost his life while in active duty. Overall, PJ Harvey's \\"Let England Shake\\" is a rather dark and melancholy record, but is a very captivating listen. It's noticeably subdued- even by PJ Harvey's standards- but works well with the emotion that is displayed throughout the album. In short, it's another great album from a great singer-songwriter.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|I really liked the look of this product. But when school started  I would place it in my bag and some how it got black  Scuff marks on it that will not come off, so just be careful not to scuff up the white part.
0553573403|5.0|I read this after having seen the first season of the series.  I loved the TV program so I thought it was worth a go.  Basically the TV series is very faithful to the book imo - so much so there wasn't really any surprises or additional information/background to the story.<br /><br />Having said that - I still loved the book.  I thought it was very well written, the characters are gripping whether you like them or not and the plot is gripping.  There are some unexpected events that if it been written by many others (or for TV) wouldn't have happened.<br /><br />My only complaint is the maps in the Kindle version - they are nowhere near good enough (can't zoom or move around) and there is no quick access to the index of houses in the back either.  However that's hardly the fault of the author.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for sure.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|In a society where everything needs to \\"do\\" something, this feels like a tech demo to show the touch screen in action.  It's pretty, especially if you turn the \\"randomize color\\" option on, but lacks enough to justify the standard $1.99 price tag.<br /><br />If you took the concept and added a soundtrack, the ability to specify how your touch controls gravity, and some rules - \\"gather as many stars as possible into this box in 20 seconds\\" / \\"rearrange this multi-colored sky so no red stars are within one inch of each other\\" / \\"force 80% of the stars into the corners with no more than five touches\\" - you could create an interesting game without really changing a thing.<br /><br />Give it a look, especially if it's still the Free App Of The Day - at under 200K, it's not like you'll need to wait around for the download to finish!  :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great in many ways,  you can set up daily readings,  it has every version of the bible ever written,  some I've never heard of.  It can also say the verse you want to hear which is cool for when you're driving.  It's easy to bookmark your favorite scriptures too.  Great app overall.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfectly executed version of the classic card game. Great graphics and gameplay. Runs beautifully on my Acer Iconia A500 running Honeycomb 3.2. Thanks for all the lost hours! ;-)
B0031KGCJO|5.0|The look of this plane is really great. And I like to land it and take off and put the wheels up and down.
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|I have enjoyed this greatly.  It has kept me entertained while I was sick.  I would recommend it.  Keeps you thinking.  Also replay able.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|This moview does a good job of making the viewer realize how non-BIG MONEY teams can actually be in the Pennant Race and even beat the Bronx Bombers.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon tattoo was a wonderful book... Very detailed, there for it took me almost a year to finish reading it with the craziness of life, but after I hit page 200 I haven't been able to put these books down, finished all 3 in the past 2 months!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This is one of the most stunning movie to experience.  It is crisp clean and inspiring.  Visuals:  The colors are crisp clean and bright.  The movie is almost completely devoid of any gain in the image.  The Computer Graphics flow seamlessly with the live action and are of top quality.  Audio:  The Surround Sound is superb on this one.  It has a full 7.1 sound mix that is near flawless.  The 7.1 comes out much better then 5.1, though that is good to.  The audio is crisp clean, and free buzz or static.  Everything is well mixed and embodies the feel of the movie.  I'm not going to go into the score which also was great.  Overall:  It is a great film that takes something so impossible and lets you accept it and enjoy it.  I wont say the story is perfect, but it is fun and continues advancing.  There are a few mildly cheesy points or 'What really?', but they are few, small, and far between.  Olivia Wilde in particular stands out for her quality acting.  I'd probably advise renting it before buying, unless your confident it is you cup of tea.  I will sometime chose to watch this film simply because of the high quality of visuals and sounds (I also really enjoy the movie.)  It really is quite stunning; a movie that benefits a lot from the Blu-ray treatment.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I was surprised at first because this app is more like interactive art than anything else. If you relax for a few moments this can really mesmerize. It has a few settings to play around with. Interesting choice, fun app.
B006LYMILI|4.0|I really had no expectations before seeing this film, if anything they were probably low since I was a fan of the original released in the late 60's but not of all of the sequels or the remake. Suspend your disbelief and you'll enjoy this movie!  First of all I don't think that the premise, at least with experimenting with medicine to stop or reverse Alzheimer's is all that far off in the future....in fact I keep hearing that there is some ready now for human experimentation.  Some people are bummed by the fact that these intelligence boasting drugs are given to the monkeys/apes to increase their I.Q. rather than them evolving over time on their own. It doesn't bother me at all, in fact the parts that some others found boring, I found the most interesting.  The animals become more intelligent, escape their captors, but then what? I guess that's where a sequel comes in.  I like James Franco but he doesn't give a very convincing performance in this. There were at least 3 scenes which called for some genuine emotion and he was just blah! This annoys me about him as an actor....he can turn in terrific performances in some films and then be so mediocre in others.  Luckily, there's Andy Serkis who plays Caesar, the chimp that Franco rescues as a baby from being destroyed and raises as his own. Caesar is advanced way beyond his human counterparts due to experimentation with his mother, and it being passed down to him. I rooted for him and that's what this film hopes that we'll do, so in that regard it accomplished what it set out to do! Serkis is absolutely amazing as Caesar, both in mannerism's and athletic ability! There should be a special award just for his performance!  The Blu-ray is sharp and clean and the sound is great....I enjoyed this and I recommend it!
B006E4QCXU|1.0|What downloaded on my Kindle Fire doesn't have any optional features.....I got the black background with tiny white particles.  That's it.  No color, no sizing, no nothing else.  Boring.<br /><br />It's been uninstalled.
B000OXHRRC|2.0|I don't like to write negative reviews but this movie was really boring.  I had hoped at least that the scenery would make up for a predictable story, but even that didn't make up for the bland, disjointed plot. The main actors here happen both to be Oscar winners, so they try to do what they can, but to no avail. It just didn't hold my attention at all, and I have a long attention span. If you're looking for a relaxing, feel-good movie with a theme of travel or self-discovery, I'd go with something like Under the 'Tuscan Sun', 'The Holiday', or the lovely 'Midnight in Paris'.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game it is very addicting but it is very tedious... if it weren't for my lack of skills I believe I would be in love with this game! it is however worth getting!
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|I personally didn't find this movie entertaining. The actors were fine, the director was fine (I guess), the screenwriting is fine, the crew did fine... it's just... meh. Maybe the MPAA is to blame for something, I don't know.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good and it has a lot of games but u have to unlock them with coins. some games r kind of difficult but fun!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|My videos arrived very promptly, earlier than I expected.  I enjoyed it tremendously, beautifully produced, movingly performed. The multiple cast members allowed us to see the talented performers who have played the lead roles. I've cried for the last 20 minutes every time I've seen it live. I finally saw the end!
B000XR4OC0|3.0|I got my 1st pair of TOMS about a year ago from Whole Foodsand I LOVE them!<br />I usually wear 7 1/2-8 (depending on what type of shoe it is) and I ended up getting an pair in 8. They are a little big, but fit good especially since I have Lupus and have severe swelling sometimes. My mom bought me 3 more pairs from here and both online and her reciet said that she ordered size 8, but we ended up getting 2 pairs that were 7 1/2 and 1 that was 8 (the bad thing was that 1 pair was that same as my 1st pair).The 7 1/2s were a tight fit. Now, we  either have to return all 3 pair or I might just sell them myself. I will just buy my TOMS from whole foods from now on since amazon screwed up our first order.
1574216988|5.0|The title for this book says it all.  Zentangles in general, and this book specifically, definitely help quiet my often domineering left brain and give my right brain the room to meditate and stretch.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I don't know how long I would be playing with this after a few weeks. But for now, I think I'm impressed. And I find it surprisingly calming to spend time and creating patterns on this screen. Definitely worth a look.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the game is intuitive and gives adequate options to allow for the novice as well as the more advanced player to enjoy the game.
B0059IVV9M|5.0|I like a lot of what Beruit has done, but this is by far my favorite. Beautiful lilting melodies, weave around slightly akilter rhythms. Like stepping into a sepia-toned daydream on a distant shore in Eastern Europe.  Though tinged with melancholia, the songs never seem smarmy or maudlin;there's always a glimmer of light beneath their overcast skies.  Love it.

B004L07KWQ|5.0|I just tried this app for the first time with my 2 year old daughter yesterday.  She absolutely loved playing with in on the Iconia A500 tablet.  The options for Crayons, markers, paint brushes, and stickers are absolutely fantastic.  My daughter actually figured out hot to change the different options quicker than my wife.  It is a very intuitive painting program and an obsolete joy to use.  Don't get me wrong, my daughter really enjoys painting with her water colors and real crayons, but if you don't want for your child to get dirty and watch his/her every step not to mess up the house, this is a great app.  5 stars.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I was pleasantly pleased with this amp's performance, especially given its size.  While I was more concerned with just being able to hear my music while on a plane I was surprised by the sound quality as most small sized amps typically just boost the audio signal with little or no improvement on the sound quality & in some cases even degrade it.

B0000041LO|5.0|I don't have the present CD set nor have I heard it, but I own the Beaux Arts Phillips vinyl recordings from the 70's.  I had known and enjoyed some Haydn symphonies and a few quartets at the time.  I had found that Haydn's quality often grabbed me from behind and was all the more telling when it did - he's not as much talked up as being this good!  The \\"Papa Haydn\\" caricature is so overwhelmingly refuted by the vast majority of the music it puzzles me how it came about at all. You more expect, because of their vaunted superiority, Beethoven or Mozart to be \\"sublime\\" in any major work, and in that sense aren't as often surprised by one of them in just the same way.  I went out and got every volume of the vinyls I could (9 of at least 10) of the trios after reading a chapter (Piano Trio) in Charles Rosen's excellent \\"The Classical Style - Haydn, Mozart Beethoven\\" (1972) where he expressed unbounded admiration for the whole series (the trios themselves, not Beaux Arts recordings, which weren't out yet).  One appetite-whetting comment by Rosen - on the main theme of the Adagio of the Trio in A-flat Hoboken #14 or Doblinger's #27 - \\"A melody of such uncomplicated beauty, it could be used at a funeral to be absolutely certain of a few tears.\\"  Rosen sadly notes - \\"It is odd to have to defend some of the greatest music ever written.  In any case the Haydn trios are doomed.  Only pianists will ever want to play them, and the modern piano recital is no place for them.\\"  It seemed to me (I'd like to think) that shortly after this book came out, later in the 70's, the Beaux Arts Trio took up a challenge and issued them nearly complete, as there seemed at the time to be no other effort to record them that was anywhere near comprehensive. I have no evidence that they ever read and were fired up by Rosen's chapter, and thus with any determination set out to refuse to allow this music's \\"doom\\" or anything. It's just one of those things that seems could have some truth and would be nice if it did.  I gave a rating to the 70's vinyls since I can't specifically review the actual new release.  I offered the comments on the old if it helps this discussion.  It was great music then, can't imagine it slipped for this release.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I could not wait to get this album.  I heard a few of her songs and really liked them.  Lana Del Rey is very talented.  The critics have no idea what they are talking about. If anything, they only increased people's interest.  So many people have commented that she has had a privileged upbringing so how could she actually know about the topics she is singing about.  All I can say is \\"who cares about her upbringing?\\"  She obviously can sing and has worked hard at this album.  I am so glad I went to Youtube to check her out instead of actually going by what critics were saying about her music.  The album is awesome.  And Lana is brilliant.  The songs show a disturbing dark side of Love and relationships.  I really enjoy listening to this album. There aren't too many albums I can honestly say I listen to the entire thing.  Every song is good. She tries to keep the songs different.  I really liked the songs \\"Off to the races\\" and \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\".
0439023513|4.0|This book was closer to a three star but I gave it four simply based on the two books that came before it that were fantastic. I could barely put the first two books down and I found myself bored and wanting to skip ahead in this book to just get to the end. The last few chapters are the only part of the book that's important. I predicted what would happen to Coin at the end. Snow's final outcome was uneventful, as was the case for Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. The author seems to have lost steam and creativity in the final book. All in all, it was a fantastic series and I'm anxious for the movie to come out.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|this is so boring and i see no point to this it cannot be used as a live wallpaper tryed to play music with this to see if anything would happen or make this app fun but nothin the particles dont move to the music only by touch also like alot of others have said last year about various app i to feel alot of these 4-5 star reviews are bogus to me there is nothin memorizing about this let alone addicting about this at all nice idea lame execution not worth any amount of money at all

0439023513|3.0|(SPOILER ALERT!!!)<br />The book doesn't end as I had expected. Truthfully, I was bracing myself for some amount of tragedy... to Prim, Gayle or Peeta.  By the end of the 2nd book I was literally praying that Peeta is alive, but at about the midpoint of Mockingjay I was sorry that they hadn't just killed him off and be over with it.  I at least would've remembered him the way I loved him. Here's why I am disappointed:<br /><br />1. The 1st two books paint Katniss as emotionally impaired but pulls so much of herself out of her through her love for Prim and especially through Peeta's love for her.  In Mockingjay so much time is spent on the actually war and Katniss' interaction with new characters from the other districts at the expense of her relationships with the other much loved characters from the previous books.  A heavy underlying theme was the love between Katniss and Peeta.  I felt bitter and betrayed for that to be reduced to the last paragraph of the book and a 2 paged epilogue.  Not enough!<br />2. The characters became shadows of themselves:<br />  a. In Mockingjay the book takes a turn where Peeta becomes unrecognizable.  The love, the little interchanges, always putting her above himself just a good depiction of what love is, becomes pretty much non-existent.  By the end of the book, not all of him has returned.  I kept reading 1 line over and over to satisfy need to get their love back: \\"But his arms are there to comfort me.  And eventually his lips\\".  I'm still left wanting.<br />  b. For as much as Haymitch was a brute in the 2 previous books, I questioned his decisions but never his motive or allegiance.  I think his character was done a disservice in this instalment.<br />  c.  Gale who I was fed titbits about in the previous novels was a likeable character.  His anger and what he became was a surprise to me.  All along I was silently rooting for Peeta but feeling bad about how Gale would feel when he lost Katniss.  Two-thirds of the way through the book I was rooting against Gale.  I thought the author lost an opportunity to bring some \\"good tragedy\\" to the book based on the fact that Katniss would now have to choose between someone who is good for her and someone who is better.  And how Gale exited her life was sad if not unrealistic. That friendship should've endured.  Makes me sad... and a bit annoyed.<br />  d.  Some of the other characters that weren't among the main characters but added richness to the book got a mere one line mention... like Madge (who I was secretly hoping Gale would fall in love with) and Gale's family that give him a more human touch.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I do believe that the Capitol turning Peeta was a good twist.  I however expected him to be deprogrammed... and that it wouldn't take the whole book to get it done.  I also thought that the play for power was very true to life (Coin/Snow).  I do think the book was still a good book.  I however feel that it failed to live up to the expectations created by its predecessors.e book I was rooting against Gale.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is a light romantic comedy with style, and even a message at the end.<br /><br />The views of Paris are probably better than most people get when by going there in person. Paris is the star of the film! The photography somehow managed to convey the look and feel of the cobblestone streets, restaurants, and bistros, as well as the normal tourist areas for viewing, shopping, and people-watching.<br /><br />I'll bet you'll get a kick out of this movie:<br /><br />*If you love a little bit of light science fiction.<br /><br />*If you have ever been curious about Hemingway, Picasso, Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Matisse, Salvador Dal&iacute;, T.

B0069UP2PI|5.0|The science may be believable in this pestilential putrescence of a film, but nothing else is.<br /><br />Not the characters, from whom we are kept at arm's length.<br /><br />Not the scenario, which veers randomly from order to chaos, then, (huh?) back to order without explanation.<br /><br />Not the dialog, which is typical Soderberghian dead pan delivered by actors we don't care about.<br /><br />And not the plot, which seems to be trying to grope his way out of darkened room without ever reaching a door.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Winslet rises during a meeting, marker in hand, to wow us with her cliched, brilliant and chilling scientific sitrep. What a joke!<br /><br />The snooty, self proclaimed high IQ'd reviewers who loved this film were absolutely right. It is realistic, and just as fascinating as sitting through the typical lecture at a mediocre college classroom.<br /><br />How anyone could be \\"terrified\\" by this silly movie is puzzling. One minute we have TEOTWAWKI, and the next all is well but for some piled garbage bags. And the power never goes off, either.<br /><br />But never fear, big daddy government and big pharma will save us as long as we don't listen to the unscrupulous, lying internet we'll be fine. Yeah, right. Thanks corporate media and shills in Hollywood.<br /><br />Soderbergh, the media darling has done it again.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I'll start with price; it's amazing to be given so much for such little price, I almost feel guilty. The movie; love it, the action sequences are pretty amazing and it looks great on Blu-ray. This final version of the series is much better than the second which was sort of silly and probably intended for teens. I'm also surprised the studio added not just the crappy version for ultraviolet but I think they realized users were pretty upset about the ultraviolet experiment and also added an iTunes versions. Yay, I think someone out there actually heard how upsetting ultraviolet was. The one true issue I have with this movie is the 3D. The 3D doesn't seem to have as much depth as other movies and I know they we're holding off on releasing the 3D version but I'm not sure it was worth waiting for.  Positives:  +Price (Incredible pricing) Disney should pay attention  +Picture (Looks sharp and bright in 3D and standard blu-ray)  +Sound (7.1 channels of heaven)  +Digital Copy ( Ultraviolet & iTunes Copy)  Negatives:  -3D (Not as much depth, was expecting more since they took a while to release the movie)  -Ultraviolet (this just needs to end)  If you were smart you waited until now to buy the movie and this time waiting really paid off.  Has anyone noticed there is a CGI soldier closer to the end of the movie? It seems strange they would add the single character there but when they get to Chicago and first get out of the car, he's there. Can anyone else verify this or am I losing it? You randomly see him next to Tyrese for the rest of the movie.

B006ZBRMOU|4.0|In general I am a huge fan of angst, but with my angst, I require a Happily Ever After too. What can I say? I am picky like that. I want my tears to be worth it. I was so very nervous to start reading Fifty Shades Freed. Excited, but definitely nervous. With everything Christian and Ana had gone through in books 1 and 2, I didn't know if they would survive much more. Plus, they really just deserved to be HAPPY.  I'm writing this review under the assumption (yeah, I know, never assume) that you have either read books 1 and 2 or won't mind a few spoilery moments. Be sure to check out my reviews of the first two books, where I swoony sigh all over the place. Also note, this trilogy has BDSM, if that's not your thing, well... sucks for you, because Fifty is HOT.  In Fifty Shades Darker our beloved Christian foils death but we don't know who the jerk that tried to kill him is. I'd really hoped that it was a female character that went a little wacko. Especially once she is out of the picture. Easy peasy, Fifty is safe. Or not.  Freed begins where Darker left off, Ana and Christian are married (everybody say woohoo!)  and on a delightful honeymoon. Fifty being, well, Fifty is a paranoid jerk that won't let Ana out of his sight. Of course, it's not a bad position to be in when you are married to a man that sizzling hot. But he's keeping his real concerns to himself, trying to protect his new wife. Only thing is, Anastasia isn't the type of woman that really feels she needs protecting, especially since she doesn't know what Christian's deal is.  Body guards, security detail, a driver, and no privacy, even when they are back home and Ana returns to work. The tension between them is a slow burn. Probably not even slow. More like, moderate. Bless his heart, Christian is adorable and I wanted to hug him for being protective of his family but man, is he frustrating.  Ana and Christian are plunged into uncertainty. Neither of them really talking about what's going on. Mostly because Christian, though he's grown since Fifty Shades of Grey, is still the same Christian. He refuses to tell his wife anything. If I were her I would have been ready to knock some sense into him. She's certainly stood up to him in the past, which is one thing I love about her. She's not weak. With the fear for his families safety running rampant in his head, Christian goes into overdrive. Every little thing sets him off and in turn, that sets Ana off because he won't talk to her.  During those stressful times, Christian decides to take Ana on a little trip with friends. Those days were so sweet and hot but under the surface, there was something (someone) laying in wait. I really wanted Christian just to learn that you can't run away from your problems (or buy your way out of them either). That's just his way though, it's the only way he knows to be. Though it's kind of twisted, it's one of the things I love about him.  Unknowingly, Ana misses an important appointment and when she realizes what has happened, there is a huge blow up between her and Christian. Hurtful, angry words are thrown around and my heart just clenched. All I could think was that was the end of them. They'd already been through so much already, how could they make it through something else? Especially something that would change both their lives forever. There are so many misunderstandings between them, I just wanted to shake them both. Then shove them in a closet and tell them \\"TALK\\"! But since I'm always a glutton for punishment, those angsty, heart breaking times were among my favorites.  Ana and Christian drift, not speaking, not looking at one another -- ugh. When she makes a move to help a family member he is torn to pieces, believing the worst of her. But she is once again, in danger, and Christian once again, is her knight in shining armor. Knight in handcuffs? Knight with bondage rope? I don't know. Whatever. Either way, he was there for her. And Ana, even though she didn't know how things were going to end up for them, she still did everything she could to protect him.  I guess that's another thing I love about those two, they are both trying to protect one another without the other really knowing. Ana is the perfect match for Christian; and he is the perfect match for her, even with his insecurities about being a good husband. I'd like to sit down with him and make him see that he's worthy of Ana's love, as well as that of his family.  Oh! I just can't say how much I loved Freed. The epilogue itself gave me a glowy happy heart. I felt it was the perfect way to end the trilogy.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|I got this as the free app of the day. its cool but i would NEVER pay money for it. ever.
B004LWZW7E|2.0|The premise of In time seemed interesting. you have a clock on your wrist that starts when you are 25 years old. Get more time and stay alive. If not, you get the idea.commerce is measured in time now, too, and life can truly become limitless. Enter the Ghetto and a dream that lives with his mother, living from minute to minute, in debt, wanting to go into another time zone and move up. Everything seems the same until he meets a man in a bar with over a century to burn.<br /><br />Maybe I expected something different, or maybe it was the way the movie played out. i'm not really sure. what I do know is that it was hard to get into this movie, and much of it was because the plot bounced around too much. One moment we are looking at a hero flick, then a moving-on-up flick, then a love flick, then some action in a round-about way. It kept pinballing and that got annoying, only coming together for the benefit of being over. When our main event happened, I thought it was about changing the world. This was reinforced by the thing with the bus (trying to be vague because of spoilers), but then it slowed to a crawl when Justin arrived at his lovely gambling destination. Romance washed away all the years of love and loyalty, and the ocean scene and the timekeeper business just made it more taxing.<br /><br />The acting was off in this film, too, with a lot of the lines and the actions coming off stiff. I have seen all the main actors before and know it could have been better, so that was disappointing. It was almost like they were doing it on purpose, like giving their lines with no \\"boom\\" was the director's idea. Equally bothersome was the way the people dressed, like a GQ spread and not living, and the way they carried themselves. I knew who a lot of the main characters were because of the actors playing them, but the lower tier characters were a bit confusing because of the age thing and the fact that no time was added ot making them distinct. In a movie when minutes are a premium, a lot of time was spent with scattered ideas like the father, the reoccurring baddies, and so on. When you combine this with a plot that is waning and a movie that becomes rather preachy in its society lesson 101 kinda way, it gets old.<br /><br />i'm not too terrible picky when it comes to my films, but this didn't make me happy. i had expectations but I dont think they were too high above the rim, and this went below. Skip it and watch something else - you'll be happier for it.ime was spent with scattered ideas like the father, the reoccurring baddies, and so on.

B0064NTZQ2|4.0|There were some ups and downs in drive and, depending on how you take things like \\"the brooding silent actor\\" will determine whether you like this or not. There is also some rather violent stuff here. Be ready for that too.<br /><br />Simple concept: a stuntman/mechanic who lives in a matchbox of an apartment pulls odd jobs on the side. He drives, and he does it well. some of this is legal and some of it is for people puling down robberies. He has a partner, and that partner is tied in with organized crime and those guys are big fish. The big fish decide that our driver is gifted behind the wheel, get involved with his legal career, and all seems to be going well. Things take a turn when neighborly devotion to a con's wife and kid turn into needing to help him out of a spot, and then spiral and get worse.<br />Lots worse.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling was good in this film. He did not have a lot of lines, however, and you could tell that was partially character - motivated and partially mood driven. In some instances this was nice, like in the middle of some action, and some scenes it made a little stale - like sitting around and watching characters not say much. It reminded me of an arthouse film in that respect, relying on expressions given and other mood or familiarity to say things. I'm not sure everyone will enjoy that. There were also other impressive cast members and they did their part as well, making characters that were not unique but that were good enough, illustrating who was a good guy and a bad guy and all the flavors in-between. I'm not saying these are great in any scope, but they pass the bar - even if most of them feel rather shallow. enter Ron Pearlman, yell yell yell. Bad guy, money, anger. You get the idea. It didn't blow me away or anything.<br /><br />The movie itself, once going, was nice to watch. We get some solid effects in the gore department, which I enjoyed a lot, and we get some impressive wheel play. The opening sequence made me think we were going to get going soon, too, but it took some time to set all the pieces. Again, not bad, just something to note. We also get a lot of build into the who and what of the story, fleshing it out a bit. The problem, in some ways, is the amount of time devoted to making a lot of the character bonds develop, and what exactly happens between them. Normally,w hen an hour is devoted to forging a connection, I can feel it. The problem here was the dialog in some respects and possibly some of the choices the movie made in what happened after-the-fact.<br /><br />I'm not saying it was not good, i enjoyed it. I thought it was a solid 4 out of 5, and that a lot of people would like it. That said, some will take exception and not like it for these, and other, reasons. On a day when I wanted what the movie seemed to promise, a thrill ride, I might have been disappointed too. I rented it, so that also made it better - i'm not sure if I would have wanted ownership outright.<br /><br />If expectations are left at the door, you will certainly enjoy it more.ut it took some time to set all the pieces.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|It fits perfectly and protects my Fire.  I'm glad I purchased it. One reviewer said it felt cheap. I strongly disagree.
B0068RHSCW|3.0|No spoilers....<br /><br />The premise: Daniel Craig and family move into their Dream House. He has plans to publish a book and spend more time with his family, and seems happy - at first. Then odd things begin to happen and looking into the footprints outside and the noises in his home unravels so much more.<br /><br />Acting in this movie was kind of hit and miss, and it was mostly because the characters were not allowed a lot of depth. The family itself, dynamic wise, did work for me at first. If it had been a different kind of movie, I could have seen them actually evoking some emotion. The problem is, when mixed into what is happening in this movie, you hit a wall. After those four main characters, you run into other people that are thrown in for plot effect, but that are not very convincing. I personally found some of the turns, when trying to tell the story, to be murder when it came to making anything tangible out of the other characters.<br /><br />The plot, while it could be interesting, has been done. I'm not going to put spoiler in, i HATE those, but I will say the first guesses on what is happening will be right here. That is kind of upsetting when you have only gone 10 minutes into a film. There are two central plot ideas here, and the good thing about one is that it is revealed after about 30 minutes. The issue with that is a second idea comes up, dealing with neighbors, and it is equally easy to figure out.<br /><br />Another thing you run into is the fact that this movie does not know what it wants to be. It certainly isn't horror and settles in as more suspense, but then turns and tries to be a supernatural thriller after a few. all that indecision really doesn't help at all.<br /><br />I was not sure what to expect, but this wasn't what I wanted. It was mild, at best, and might fit someone's idea of a thriller IF you do not watch many films. I'm not saying it isn't watchable or horrible, just not really rewarding because of a number of issues. A weak 3 stars at best
B006E4QCXU|2.0|Yes, as other reviewers mentioned it is a nice-looking app, but after a few seconds I was wondering, &quot;Now what? &quot; There are many other ways to relax or entertain. Not bad for free, but I find it hard to believe that people would actually shell out money for this.
B005LTDPFW|5.0|This set is an incredible value. It includes all nine original RCA Victor albums, and adds 35 bonus tracks, including additional songs or session material from each time period on each of the 9 CDs. The booklet gives details on all the sessions and sources. The set is also remastered.  The 35 bonus tracks collect together all of the special rarities that have ever been placed on an RCA/BMG collector's edition, or other compilations.  Music critics might debate which period of Nina Simone's recordings were the best, but the RCA period is certainly essential Nina.  If you get this set, you will have all of the other Nina Simone RCA CDs and RCA compilations in one small package, with mini-LP carboard sleeves showing the vinyl-LP covers.  Get it while you can!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I bought this blu ray set after Lost ended so I could re-watch the entire series. It's great!  The blu ray quality is actually better than watching the series on tv. The audio commentaries and bonus tracks are icing on the cake. Don't expect too much from that epilogue they filmed, though. No secrets are revealed, it's just for fun.

1466401885|5.0|I fell in love with two fictional characters! What an emotional roller coaster I went on! It was raw, intense, electric, obsessive, addictive, emotional, and beautiful. I went through the ups and downs of Abby and Travis's relationship. I was heartbroken when Travis was heartbroken and I was with Abby as she tried to separate herself from her past. Probably one of the best books I've read, which scares me, now every book I read from here on out will have to be just as good! Those of you who were fans of Kane Richards Must Die, will love this book! A fighter who falls for the girl in her cardigan sweater watching her first \\"street fight.\\" He picks her out in the crowd and doesn't let her out of his sight from there on out! Two college students, finding their way, and realizing two is better than one. What's not to love?  What a fabulous disaster and beautiful mess this was :)
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I have never been much of a fan of Anime films, I think most of the story lines are just strange to me.  I absolutely love this film- it engages the children's imaginations, they can remember the film very easily and follow the plot and story-line.  One of the few full length films I have been able to discuss in entirety with 2 yr olds on a regular basis.  Glad to find it available, a little pricey for just a dvd but still with availability so low not too bad.  I guess I just don't usually buy dvd's at regular list price- so the fact that I made the exception for this might also say something.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Wowza. That's all I can say. This book blew me away.<br /><br />Lena has gone her whole life looking forward to the day she can have the surgery that will eradicate love from her mind. Kids are brought up learning that love is the sickness that led to all of our past faults, including crimes and even wars. Now that there is no love, there is only peace. Out of the blue, a young man named Alex enters Lena's life and shakes it up like she never could have imagined. I don't want to give away too much here, but the book's summary has already told you Lena falls in love. And how. She and Alex buck the system, though it isn't an easy thing for Lena to do, given her upbringing. She has to fight her feelings because they are a sign of the delirium taking hold.<br /><br />I thought the plot was fantabulous and such a unique idea. I have to give credit to Lauren Oliver here, because the way she wrote totally had me convinced that this `no love' thing was a good idea! I understood why Lena and everyone saw this as a valid way of life. The writing was so descriptive; you are simply dropped into this world that looked like ours but was so different. The people, buildings and scenery were fully fleshed out and you could absolutely picture everything as it was described. The characters were complex and believable. Nothing they ever did was anything I would consider out of character or odd.<br /><br />The dialogue was also believable and spot-on. I loved the way Lena and her best friend got along and were like regular teenage girls. The tension Lena felt with her family made you feel for her and her situation. As Lena started to have feelings for Alex, her hesitations and thoughts felt true to me. The chemistry between Alex and Lena was intense and I loved it. This was a real love story, not one of those `instalove' things that many young adult books suffer from.<br /><br />There was lots of action and it was so enthralling that by the end of the final climax, I was literally wringing my hands. I was in the cafeteria at work and I know people were looking at me but I didn't care. I wanted to get to the end and see what happened, but I didn't want it to end. And damn if it didn't make me teary-eyed.<br /><br />Reviewed by The Busy Bibliophile.work and I know people were looking at me but I didn't care.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Very few films can capture the intensity that `Drive' is able to contain, and do so with such bridled passion for every frame.  What Nicolas Winding Refn does here is similar in scope to what David Fincher was able to achieve with last years `The Social Network'.  Every frame is beautifully composed to exact from us the precise emotion relevant to our understanding and appreciation of the film's structural progression.<br /><br />In other words, this is the directorial masterpiece of the year.<br /><br />But, `Drive' is far more than a mere moody masterwork.  A friend of mine mentioned that this is cinematic to the bone, and that is so true.  Every frame is a visual work of genius, so expressive in its ability to convey richness in tones with a mere shading of atmosphere.  The way that the film is perfectly edited (I mean, for a film so brisk in running time, it manages to fill it's frames with intense action AND detailed character development) suits the film's overall progression and remains instilled in the audience's mind long after the credits have finished rolling.  With muted moments (the dialog is far less important than the body language), `Drive' is a stunning cinematic achievement in a year composed and stunning cinematic achievements (seriously, this year is AMAZING).<br /><br />Ryan Gosling adds yet another knock out performance to his long list of intriguing and diverse characters.  Here he plays a driver (never named) who spends his days working in a garage for a man named Shannon who gets him in to do stunt work for movies and also, when needed, to drive getaway for crooks.  By chance, this driver meets a young mother in the same apartment building he is in.  Her name is Irene and her husband is currently serving time in prison.  They obviously have a connection but that connection is severed when her husband, Standard, is released from prison.  Standard owes some bad people some money but he is unable to pay it, and since the driver doesn't want to see something bad happen to Irene or her son, he offers to help Standard out.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />The second half of `Drive' shifts gears from brooding character study to intensity driven action flick, but those two worlds mesh marvelously thanks to Gosling's impenetrable stare and Winding Refn's superb handling of each scene's emotional dimensions.  The 80's inspired soundtrack coupled with the purposeful toying with time and speed (that elevator sequence is particularly magnificent) help establish `Drive' as an entity all its own.<br /><br />Yes, this is NOT what you think it'll be, but it is everything you could ask it to be.ne or her son, he offers to help Standard out.

B0069UP2PI|5.0|`Contagion' is one of those films that continues to grow in my eyes as one of the best (in the very least, one of the most underrated) films of 2011.  Ever since first seeing it upon its release, it has only grown in esteem to me; a film that is truly inspired and original in its dissection of a global horror story.  From the film's claustrophobic cinematography to its sharply spliced editing to the perfectly timed performances that soak in the realism of every scene; `Contagion' feels like a documentary embellished with a director's visual approach.<br /><br />In `Contagion', a young woman named Beth contracts what she assumes is a cold, but that cold then spreads rapidly, killing many as it overtakes the globe.  From the vantage point of the doctors striving to find a cure, `Contagion' bypasses the clich&eacute;d approach taken by most viral films (that is, merely focusing on riots in the street and social and moral decline) but giving us a fresh and intriguing look at what happens `behind the scenes'.  Soderbergh and company develop a story that screams realism, from those working for the greater good as well as those focused on stardom and or financial benefits; and it never shies away from presenting the film's `heroes' as imperfect men.<br /><br />With an impressive cast (who nearly all deliver noteworthy performances), Soderbergh's `Contagion' is a magnificent thriller that sends the chills without every sacrificing the intelligence needed to make this film memorable.

0440243688|3.0|All-American Action Hero Jack Reacher returns in the thirteenth installment of Lee Child's action series. In this episode, Reacher, an ex-Army MP who roams the country carrying only a toothbrush, an ATM card and his passport, turns up in New York City. It's late at night and Reacher is riding the subway. As he thinks about the warning \\"If you see something, say something\\", his attention is drawn to a lone woman. He observes that she is exhibiting all the signs of a suicide bomber. On a hot September day, she is wearing a bulky overcoat, her lips are moving as if reciting a prayer, and her hands are hidden in a large canvas bag. Reacher assumes that the bag holds a bomb's trigger mechanism and he calmly approaches her. He identifies himself as a police officer and asks her to show him what's in the bag. The woman takes out a gun, raises it to her chin, and pulls the trigger.  The police investigate and then the FBI shows up, followed by Homeland Security and some other Federal agents who won't identify themselves. They all want to know if the woman gave anything to Reacher. After he is released, Reacher is shot with a tranquilizer gun and imprisoned. He escapes, and meets with a powerful Senator who has something to hide. He is then contacted by a Ukranian, Lila Hoth, who tells him what's going on. According to Lila, she and everyone else are looking for the MacGuffin. In case you don't know, Alfred Hitchcock used 'MacGuffin' to represent something that people will do anything to obtain, but which has nothing to do with the plot. In this book, the MacGuffin is a computer memory stick that the dead woman was carrying. It holds damaging information about events that occurred when the Senator was on a secret Special Forces mission in Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion in the 1980s.  Reacher eludes his pursuers who think that he knows where the MacGuffin is. As usual, Reacher easily overcomes multiple attackers and has many daring escapes. However, he must be gettingold as, this time, he has a rare miss when he tries to shoot one of his assailants. He finally prevails, but this time around, he doesn't manage to escape without even a scratch.  This book gets three stars - two for the action, one for the descriptions of New York City and, unfortunately, zero for the mystery.
0440419514|5.0|I'm 16 and really love these books. I think they're well-written and interesting, and would recommend to many people. Honestly, I'm not into fantasy (don't like Harry Potter, wizards and magic, annoyingly long fantasy names, etc.) but thought these books were awesome. Once in a while I find a fantasy series that really pulls me in and holds my attention, and this trilogy did that.  Anyways.. if you've read any other reviews, you know what the books are about. :P I'll just talk about the set.  I ordered this boxed set because I liked the cover art much more than that of others editions. It's very pretty and nice.  Also, each book has extra \\"files\\" from a character in the back. the first book has some of Lord Asriel's files, second has Dr. Grumman's, and third has Mary Malone's. These files are hand written notes and drawings, which are a pretty cool addition. They give some insight into the characters.  So yeah, it's a very nice set. If you're careful with the paperbacks, the covers won't bend too easily (I'm careful about messing up the covers.) The box is nice as well, with some cool artwork. It isn't as large as I thought it was going to be (but I guess I just didn't know the thickness of the three books.)  And.. To those complaining about the message and themes in the books (about religion and god) your faith must be paper thin to be swayed by a work of FICTION. Although I don't consider my self a Christian, my family is Lutheran, and even my parents understand that it's fiction and aren't bothered by it.  The only reason why I wouldn't recommend these to young kids is because they may not understand everything, or like the writing style. Most people say \\"10 and up\\" but I know that when I was 10, I wouldn't have enjoyed them or appreciated them. But I think that kids should still be able to at least TRY them, and be able to read what they want, without their parents choosing for them. How are kids supposed to know what they like to read when their parents try tofilter their choices?  ANYWAY. I love this set and these books. Very nice.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I wish more books were written like this.  I'm a huge animal lover, and not only is it apparent that Stein is as well, but his main character Denny is too, often treating him with as much care as any other family member.  I'm not going to lie; this book got me a bit teary eyed.  The expression of love for the characters, the beautiful picture that Stein painted in my mind about the passing of a loved one, it really struck a chord for me and it was the kind of book I was sad to finish.  It's a quick read, and sometimes you wish there were more to it, but really, it's the perfect length for the story.  Enzo the dog is so wise, so in tune with humans, their frailty, their strengths and their weaknesses.  I can't praise this book enough, I wish there were more like it.  Very well done and wonderfully touching.
B003Y5H542|4.0|I loved \\"Rango.\\"  I loved the animation, the characters, the entire look and feel of the movie.<br /><br />I've seen some complaints about this movie not being appropriate for children (some images, language, double entendres).  Well, I wouldn't have thought twice about taking my boys to it when they were young.  They would have loved the creatures of the desert and the jokes would have gone over their heads.  But, you know what?  Not all animated movies HAVE to be for children.  I watched the extended version and I have to say, the only things I thought might bother a child were an armadillo that got run over and squished (and he actually lives) and a hawk and a snake being \\"bad guys.\\"  But come on - have your kids seen [[ASIN:B004AKCMES Bambi]] or [[ASIN:B00005RRG4 Old Yeller]]?  More traumatic to children, in my opinion.<br /><br />I just loved the characters, especially Rango, and Beans, the female iguana, and Priscilla, the mouse.  I rented this but I plan on buying a copy for my library so I can watch it with my new grandchildren in a few years.  Fun, fun.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Neat little app. Couldn't justify paying for it, however, so it was nice that it was free. After a couple minutes, one Is left yearning for more variance. Sound even. Worth checking out while you can.
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|I love movies, all kinds of movies, but sports genre movies aren't usually my first choice.  But I liked \\"Moneyball\\" very much.  It's loosely based on the true life story of General Manager Billy Beane and the Oakland A's baseball team.<br /><br />I'm always a sucker for an underdog story and I like unusual, offbeat movies so this was a win-win for me.  Brad Pitt was low key in the role of Beane, playing the GM/ex-baseball player - a maverick, going against tradition and hiring players by numbers rather than an arcane convoluted instinctual system that had been used previously.<br /><br />My favorite in the movie is Jonah Hill, playing Yale graduate, Peter Brand, who had majored in economics and uses a complex system of statistics to rank ball players.  He is hired to be Beane's assistant GM.  This is a much more serious role for Hill than I've seen him in before and in my opinion, it's his performance that makes the movie a success.<br /><br />I also liked the Good Ole Boy scouts and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the team manager.<br /><br />Good story, great casting, some unnecessary family moments - all-in-all a sports movie that I enjoyed and will probably watch again in the future.<br /><br />(Oh - I did like Beane's daughter in the movie, Kerris Dorsey, singing \\"The Show\\" sung previously by Lenka.  Good song and Dorsey does an admirable job on it.)<br /><br />As an extra on the DVD was also a segment that has the real Billy Beane talking about reinventing the game - liked that, too.
B0052U59F4|1.0|This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read.  it doesn't even qualify as a book.  it seems that a 5th grader could do better than this!!  between the repetitive  \\"don't bite your lip,\\"  \\"eat\\"  \\"sit\\"  \\"breath hitching\\" and the BDSM, which got so  annoying by the 2nd time,  I wanted to stick a fork in my eye.  Save yourself some money and find some real fiction - not this juvenile piece of crap.
B005WFWVL4|4.0|I have wanted to see this movie ever since it was first released.  I missed it in the theater so bought my copy as soon as it came out on DVD.<br /><br />Scary movie to me, one of the scariest I've seen in a long time, just because it could actually happen at any time.  With the dense population centers around the world and transportation to all corners of the globe, if an unknown virus, as depicted in this movie, develops, it will only be by the grace of God if ANY of us survive.<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\" showed horrific scenes but it was mainly a movie about how a virus like this could suddenly appear, how easily it could spread, about how people and healthcare providers and governments would handle not only the disease but the ongoing disaster of too few caregivers, no vaccines, starvation, rioting, and fear and panic.<br /><br />I think the movie was done well but I believe it downplayed how catastrophic a pandemic such as this actually would be.  As I said - scary!  Other movies I've liked along the same storyline are [[ASIN:6305077487 Andromeda Strain]] and [[ASIN:B001CT876M Outbreak]].
B005GYGCOI|3.0|Just used this title traveling in India. The weight saving was a godsend of course but I found myself continually frustrated by the clumsy way this has been converted to ebook format.

Would still buy again for the convenience but could have been so much better.

1849514003|5.0|As I'm not an english natural speaker, I will be shorter than other review, but all I can say it's a really good and usefull book.  Easy to understand and with lot of great receipe.  If you can read English and want to use cocos2d (or for general knowing as there are physics or AI), this book is a must have.  Thanks for that.  Damien

B004T4KQJS|2.0|...in modern theoretical cosmology, lets face it. What I mean is that 'from' implies 'beginning'. Since last several years new models have indicated cyclical, eternal Universe (good examples are worked out by Roger Penrose or Paul Steinhardt/Neil Turok). Eternity is more acceptable than 'one time creation'.<br /><br />Here we have compressed explanation of history, discoveries like acceleration and how Universe may end (though this is much better presented in [[ASIN:0684865769 The Five Ages of the Universe: Inside the Physics of Eternity]] by Fred Adams).<br /><br />Krauss writes for laymen/masses, but content may be painful if this is somebody's first book about quantum/particles and concordance cosmology. On the other hand to explain everything would require large and tedious volume, author obviously made many short cuts to avoid it and I see it as a positive.<br />For example, author does not go into describing exactly what is the Plank Time. He does not  mention that BOOMERANG/WMAP graph (p.52)at large angular scales seems less powerful than EXPECTED by the theoretical curve.<br /><br />And we have of course a HUGE semantic controversy about 'nothing'. This has been commented at large, but I will mention just one example: \\"..the energy of empty space cannot be physically infinite..\\"(p.71). If we have energy in space, that means space is not empty, because we all know that mass is a 'frozen' energy.<br /><br />The 'from nothing' idea in variety of forms, has been around since Kant. Krauss does not present anything revelatory. He just sensationalizes it.<br /> I am not convinced about \\"from nothing\\". We cannot produce something from nothing; the mass of produced particle must come from conversion of energy from some other form to this one. To make a massive particle such as a Z-boson we must cause a particle collision with high enough available energy. Similar statement can be found in ALL science books. The same doubt had prominent and influential John Archibald Wheeler. \\"How does something arise from nothing?\\", he asked about the existence of space and time (Princeton Physics News, 2006).<br />Casimir effect shows that empty space is not empty, but NOTHING so far has been manufactured or jumped out from between the plates during experiments in the lab.<br /><br />Krauss admits that nothing = 'almost nothing' (p.148) - fine with me, but it is obvious, that title has been manipulated to attract targeted cohorts of readers.<br />And more: can Krauss demonstrate he is right about 'nothing is unstable'? What is the calculation leading to conclusion?<br />At least Steinhardt/Turok's proposition about flying branes is supported by abstract calculations.<br /><br />Finally Krauss changes his mind. His criticism , content of \\"Hiding in the Mirror\\" has vanished. He admits that multiverse is a viable option! So how is Dr. Krauss?<br /><br />General conclusion: \\"A Universe from Nothing\\" is a very mediocre one among plethora of truly popular science books written by cosmology leaders (for example, written 12 years ago by John Barrow [[ASIN:0375726098 The Book of Nothing: Vacuums, Voids, and the Latest Ideas about the Origins of the Universe]] is largely superior, representing great depth in explainng 'vacuum's nothingness'). It could have been a 3* book if not a large number of pages where Church, Pope, God, Creator and religion are mentioned. Totally unnecessary. Hitchens (addict, uneducated, and at best controversial individual who rests hm..in piece?) and neo-darwinist Dawkins, are/were Krauss best pals?  I do not like NEO-S. Dawkins should be treated in mental institution or become the subject of experimental philosophy- according to Australian philosopher David Stove who is probably agnostic and represents 'inductive scepticism' views (check Wiki for details). I also noticed that great astrophysicist Martin Rees (2011 Templeton Prize winner !!) endorsed the book. This stunned me, what a shame! Rees got the prize for tolerance andsupport of co-existence of religion and science!<br /><br />Krauss himself is a writer/speaker, but not the best. He is just a run of the mill, bored academic. He has not discovered anything important in cosmology. He does not have his own theory or model he could research. He is not Guth, Weinberg, Susskind, he is not Turok , neither he is Steinhardt , Penrose, Hawking or Vilenkin or Linde. He just goes around and sells well known, regurgitated, old idea, spiced up by attacks against people who dare to be spiritual. He goes after $$$ , that is all.<br /><br />In this book he galloped so fast, that he lost ability to control his knowledge.<br /><br />I always try to get the book written by scientist who has something new to propose, has discovered something new, made significant paradigm shift or lead a team of colleagues into successful project, etc. There are more names, like: John Barrow, Robert Kirshner, Maurizio Gasperini, George Smoot, Kep Thorne, Frank Wilczek, Leon Lederman. I live near the Perimeter Institute (Waterloo) where Lee Smolin and John Moffat work, and sometimes go there to attend public lectures (I have not seen Krauss there and I hope he will never come here).<br />All these people have achieved something - Krauss has nothing spectacular in his sleeve, nothing. History of cosmology will never mention him in the future.<br /><br />I keep [[ASIN:B000FZDKR0 Hiding in the Mirror: The Mysterious Allure of Extra Dimensions, from Plato to String Theory and Beyond]] on my shelf among other pop cosmo-science books. I returned \\"A Universe from Nothing\\" to my local library. No money for nothing,  and the chicks.. they may be for free (google: 'Krauss Epstein').<br /><br />UPDATE: (May 2012). Epstein (described by Wikipedia as \\"an American financier and science philanthropist, and convicted sex offender\\") a couple weeks ago \\"Convened a Conference of Nobel Laureates to Define Gravity\\" (pure propaganda IMO).

B000002KLZ|3.0|I got this Fleetwood Mac double album today, ripped it to my hard drive, mounted it from my laptop and was going to enjoy an evening of vintage Fleetwood Mac. Wrong! The sound quality is SO bad that I went to the other computer to see what was wrong? Must be a loose connection or such surely, Nope, I played direct from the CD, it is perhaps the worst sounding disc I've ever owned. The better your system is, the worse it sounds. I would describe the sound as that of a 1960's transistor radio in a garbage can. Wow! I can't believe there are not more folks complaining about this one. Not the seller's fault, disc is in excellent condition. Well, you can see or hear, why it didn't  get played by the original owner. Static and Hiss are why it never got played, and only once here as well, I'm getting rid of this one asap.<br /><br />I've moved it to my sell shelf, and won't bother to make a copy. Will remove it from my hard drive, it is a waste of space. I only listen to AIFF files, no compression nor compaction for me. Give me all of the native signal, I've the gear to handle it. The only other disc I think I've owned that is this bad is John Lennon's Wedding Album. And this from a die in the wool Fleetwood Mac fan. Love you guys... but this one you should have kept to yourselves.<br /><br />Don't know what else to say, a very sad ending to a double disc album I so looked forward to listing to, over and over.<br /><br />I'm off to better sounding tunes for the evening listen...<br /><br />Enjoy!
014312093X|4.0|John LeCarre's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is as important historically as it is to the genre of espionage fiction. LeCarre' not only presented an alternative to Ian Fleming's fantasy spy world presented through James Bond, but also created a fictional world of duplicity and corruption eating away at institutions like a cancer that mirrored real life cases of double agents such as Kim Philby. The novel appeared in the perfect climate for lapsed faith in institutions. The Cold War was still raging, although cases such as Philby's raised questions about its success. It was published early in 1974; later that year, across the pond, Richard Nixon was forced into resignation by revelations brought out by the Watergate scandal. LeCarre's lexicon has also exerted a powerful influence on institutional corruption. The term `mole' has become almost as ubiquitous as `Catch-22'.  LeCarre's anti-Bond hero, George Smiley, has been (forcibly) retired from MI6 only to be called back into clandestine service by his government to follow clues indicating that a mole has been operating for the Soviets from within British intelligence. Smiley is not only an excellent spy; his deductive powers rank alongside master detectives such as Holmes and Poirot. He follows leads and false leads down dizzying mazes that would tax the most astute minds until he narrows his focus to the point where he possesses certainty.  The maze that extends outward in multiple directions from Smiley's initial covert assignment possesses the verisimilitude of life and is just as confusing, frustrating and ambiguous. One would need a large wall-sized diagram of the interlocking characters positioned in their overt roles with alternate images for their covert characters to understand everything that happens in this novel. The good news is that all the confusion does end with a powerful payoff that proves worthy of the journey.  LeCarre', through Smiley, the master spy that is as loyal to his agency and his governmentas one could find, expresses the ambivalence that appears inevitable for anyone who finally sees the broad picture that portrays spies as merely players in a global game. One's allegiance is secondary to one's kinship with a fellow practitioner. Smiley and Karla are almost mirror images of each other; Smiley gives the cigarette lighter given to him by his wife to Karla to solidify that presumptive bond. By the conclusion of the novel, when Smiley lays the trap for the mole and confirms his identity as a friend and colleague, he understands his friend's reasons and, while he falls short of re-evaluating his own loyalty, he sees with greater clarity the weaknesses in the foundation of the bureaucracy he has spent all his adult life serving.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a fun game but some of the games on the game are harder then others are some are fun and a handfull are boring.
014312093X|4.0|John Le Carre's \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy\\" was first publishe in 1974. The title is taken from a nursery rhyme and is used by Le Carre to refer to the chief suspects of being spies for the Soviets. The novel lept to the top of the heap of novels in the international espionage genre. The book was made into a fine BBC series and is now a major motion picture. Though the action takes place in the cold war 1970s it is stll a gripping read in the tradition of Eric Ambler and Graham Greee.<br />  The Plot is very complicated demanding the reader's full attention! The antihero is world weary George Smiley who has been fired from the \\"Circus.\\" (the British secret service). Smiley is flabby, world weary, old and his wife Ann has left him for another chap at the office.<br />  Smiley is surprisingly asked to root out a \\"mole\\" in British intelligence. A mole is an enemy spy who is able to burrow into the inner circle of a belligerent's spy service.. The novel consists of Smiley going over old files and interviewing many persons who were involved n the case of Jim Ellis. Ellis was a spy who was captured in Czech. by the Soviets in the 1970s.<br />  What makes the book stand out above others in the overcrowded spy genre?<br />a. Le Carre is a master of complex plots. British and secret service slang and jargon can make the book read slowly for Yankee eyes.<br />b. Le Carre has so many characters in his tales that it is hard to remember who is who and who is speaking.<br />c. Do not expect wild chases and sex escapades a la James Bond in LeCarre' somber tales. The author is an intellectual who writes for adults.<br />  Le Carre's books are classics which, despite their flaws, hold up well and are worth reading.

It's easy to tell which Fire is mine.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|Take Shelter is more of a psychological drama / semi-suspenseful movie than a \\"thriller\\" per-se.  It can be a little slow moving at times but really does keep you on the edge of your seat as you're waiting to see where this is all leading.<br /><br />The movie is very well acted and filmed. While slow at times it's not poorly paced, and constantly will toss in small twists and turns to keep it moving along.<br /><br />This is a perfect movie to rent and I really found it an enjoyable film to watch.  Purchasing it for $10+ or so? probably not, but if you can redbox or blockbuster it for 1-3, thats just about perfect.<br /><br />the ending? well... I'd love to converse with people about it that have seen it because... well ugh... no spoilers!
B0064NTZJO|1.0|From the trailer I thought this would an \\"action\\" movie with thrilling car chases, etc, etc.  Yes, there is one big car chase scene. BUT most of the rest of the movie is mostly plodding long slow scenes of a very sullen Mr. Gosling.  Then there are a few very graphic, gross, bloody, violent beatings, murders, and worse!  Yuck!  Yes Gosling has made some good movies. This is not one. Any talent is completely hidden.  In case you can't stand it to the end, and I sure wish I had had the good sense to stop before...  All the lead players and several of minors and extras DIE. Bloody horrible deaths.  Except it seems that somehow the Driver lives and the Girl lives. Apart.  No they don't even have a sex scene.  One kissing session which is just a diversion while Driver waits to make his move on Killer/Assasin #4 or was it #5. Who cares.  Let me say it again. This movie SUCKS.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed the You Version of the Bible for almost a year.  The most wonderful part is the variety of translations.  I find it very interesting to read a passage in the NIV then change to the New King James version to read it again with a different twist.  Bible study and structured reading is a definite benefit.

B000V6I7WG|5.0|Chan-wook Park's 'Oldboy' is a tale of revenge. But to simplify the movie in one word would be to do it injustice. Raising questions right from the opening sequence till the very last frame as the credits begin to roll, the story is as engaging as it is thought-provoking. The characters are resolved wonderfully, especially Min-sik Choi's 'Oh Dae-su'. The cinematography and soundtrack lend to the drama, often becoming characters by themselves.  The Tartan Asia Extreme Edition Blu-ray is the best way to see the film as of today. Video quality boasts of excellent preservation of grain structure and some impressive black levels. Close-ups reveal a lot of detail like wrinkles, pores and cloth textures. It easily one-ups any previous editions of the film as one can now appreciate the already stunning cinematography on a completely new level.  Audio is presented in the form of a DTS 7.1 HD Master Korean track along with a couple of lossy options for the native language. There are two lossy English tracks on the disc, but the movie is best seen in its native language for maximum impact of the acting. I saw the movie in the lossless audio format, and the experience was terrific. The soundtrack is clearer than ever, there is much more ambiance than one might have expected and the dialogue is crisp. Gore-lovers will appreciate the audio detail in sounds that compliment the visual cues of torture and violence. Of course, it might also turn out to be a bit too much for the squeamish.  Anyone who appreciates this movie deserves to treat him/herself with this edition. If you haven't seen the movie yet, get this disc anyway. Just be prepared for a ride you might never forget.

0553801473|2.0|Others have probably made the same points I'm going to write, so I'll keep it short.<br />Long, lacks direction. A few good bits, but it's mostly just wanting to know how the story will progress that keeps you reading. And it fails to do that much.<br />Martin has picked up a habit of killing off the nice characters and the rest are just milling about aimlessly. Plenty of new minor characters that don't do much for the main storyline, but then I'm starting to wonder if there is a main storyline anymore.<br />I think it's becoming increasingly difficult to salvage the story. It's almost ground to a standstill and most of the remaining characters and worth caring for.<br />If Martin does manage to breathe new life into the series I doubt he'll finish before he pulls a Jordan.<br />Terrible shame, it had so much promise.

B0065NAKRO|4.0|This is a good dominoes app, but there is room for improvement. The worst part: there is no spinner. I don't know about other people, but I have always played dominoes with a spinner and hate that I can't do that with this app. Somebody update this app with a spinner, please!  My other complaint is that this app boasts that there are 5 different Domino games, but some of them seem to be the same game, only with different names. Even after reading the rules and playing both games, I still cannot tell the difference between Muggins and All Fives. It may be just a user error, though.  Other than that, this app is good. You can customize different aspects of the game, such as domino style and number of players. Selecting and placing the dominoes is easy and gameplay is fast. It's a fun app, it just needs to be updated a little.

B005WFPAU8|5.0|They should have stopped at No. 4.  The movie was just too silly to be good.  The acting was low budget.  The only good parts in the movie were the moments when the people died.  This just was not a good movie.  I was very disappointed.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|*System Note: Review Written Using htc Evo 4G Decided, as I do anyday the Free App looks, to download- Gravilux and give it a whirl, and I could not be happier. This app will prove quite the delightful diversion, and the best praise I can think to say is I would consider this worth the asking price of $1.99.  The premise of this app is that you are in control of a field of points- called stars within the application- and you can alter the gravity of the situation, the color of the stars, the density of the field of stars, and whether or not your touch will attract or repel the stars. After running this App's through its paces my only issue was that the color changing menu was not as intuitive as I would have hoped, but not bad by any means.  Overall this app is a well designed effort, and if you are looking for some fun light science- look no further- and purchase now.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this app is just great you are able to make some breathtaking scenes with the stars or just fool around and bundle them all together and make them explode outwards with the gravity.  Another feature which I like is the fact you can change the Color based on the speed of the stars.  The only thing I wish this app would have is the ability to save screenshots but despite that fact I still give this app 5 stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app! I have my daily reading plan widget right on my home screen on my tablet and I have set a reminder every day to remind me to read. Also, I can plug in speakers and have it read to me while I wash dishes, drive, etc. I love that it has actual voices, not computer voices. you can download different versions of the Bible that you can access without internet. My only complaint is that the daily reading plans have to have internet to show you your reading for the day. However, you just need to look at your reading for the day then look it up on a Bible that you downloaded. Then, when you get back to internet, you can update the reading that you did. You can also catch up your reading if you get ahead or behind. Overall, excellent app.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|definitely impressed this app is free! very smooth and fun! I would recommend giving this app a shot while its free!

B005LAIIS0|1.0|***SPOILERS***  This is the worst Liam Neeson movie I have ever watched. Plot? No plot. No character development. Horrible screenplay.  We see John Ottway (Liam Neeson) in Alaska protecting oil workers from the indigenous animals that would want to do them harm while working in the field. He shoots a wolf that charges some workers working on a pipe in a field. We get flashbacks of a woman whom I'm assuming is his wife? Maybe. We don't find out...ever. You can tell in these opening scenes he is a little depressed and we are assuming it is the women in his flashbacks. One night he is goes into the bar for a few shots of alcohol and leaves to end up behind a building ready to shoot himself with his rifle. He hears wolves howling and decides not to kill himself. Change scenes to next day and he is going to be getting on a plane to the lower 48. It just so happens the camera catches the crew on the tarmac attempting to de-ice the plane. The plane is full of oil workers and one sits next to Neeson and begins to talk his ear off. Neeson is annoyed and asks him to be quiet and he is going to shut his eyes. The guy moves and Neeson dreams of the woman again. Action scene ensues and the plane goes down with Neeson waking up in the snow. He walks over a ridge and sees the plane destroyed and goes to look for survivors. We've seen all these scenes so far in the previews. No big deal right? Wrong. Neeson finds only he and 6 other people survive and they attempt to stay warm and not die. Neeson explains they will not be found since the oil company doesn't care. Now the wolves come and start to eat the dead. They post lookouts and during the night the lookout is killed by wolves. They find him in the morning and Neeson tells the survivors they need to get to the tree line to better defend themselves. He explains if they are within a certain amount of miles to the wolves den they will keep coming to defend it and more than likely kill them all. They go for the tree line and end upgetting picked off one by one until the last scene is of Neeson who ends up in the den. During the entire movie Neeson has flashbacks of the woman and his father. The last flashback of the woman is her in a hospital with an IV drip so we're assuming she is now dead and that is why he is depressed. Again we have no idea because we don't learn anything about his character or any of the other survivors. Nothing. The last scene is of Neeson and conveniently he is only going to fight the alpha wolf in the den. He gets ready, he has a knife, tapes broken liquor bottles to one hand and recites a poem his father wrote. He and the wolf are ready to fight and BAM, black screen, roll credits. What?!? The entire theater burst out crying \\"NO\\" and cursed the screen. I walked out of the theater feeling I just got mugged in the alley. Not even rental worthy
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|Just like a lot of other reviews mine also failed. it lasted for about 6 uses and then the video started to cut in and out , so now I have a 35.00  unusable piece of junk.. Do not buy . check out the other reviews , this is a common failure.

1449408656|5.0|I found this book at my university's campus bookstore and immediately bought it after flipping through a few pages. I had never actively read the webcomic but I recognized the artist's style, having seen it around the internet once or twice. This collection of comics is hysterical and a MUST READ for any 'cat person'. The comics are so relatable (ex: Spending $30 on a nice toy for your cat and they IMMEDIATELY would rather play in a FREE cardboard box from my recent move.)  (As an aside: I think even my two cats realize what this book is about. I woke up this morning to find one of my kitties sleeping on my copy. I guess she thinks that Cats win.)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really have enjoyed this app.It's everything I've aspected and more.The features are great and the daily bible planner reminders , I love! Thanks for bringing this Bible app into my world .
B006E4QCXU|1.0|downloaded app from store, it went straight to the cloud and tried to retrieve it but it wouldn't install. one star albeit it looks pretty cool
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have always said to myself that I would start reading the Bible more often (preferably every day) and now its undeniably easy to do! The plans that they have are incredible. I just started my first one and so far I love it! I would recommend this great app to anyone!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is fun. I really, really, really enjoy the fact that I'm not just getting one game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I don't think it takes much time at all to unlock games. I played Cookies over and over to gain points, then I did Land n' Sky over and over, and now Picture Perfect. Land n' Sky and Picture Perfect are great for quickly earning points, because the games aren't timed, but are done as soon as you finish them (15 to 20 seconds). I earned points to unlock the last game which I don't mind playing over and over. I think it's great, but will now worry if I ever have to update.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Cool app toy on my tablet but why does it require permission to make phone calls? This as live wallpaper would be cool!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun but addictive..who would have thought the old card game could be so fun. Stress reliever at end of day.
B005FITIGO|5.0|The movie \\"Margin Call\\" depicts the events that immediately preceded the Financial Crisis in 2008 within a nameless Investment Bank. What I like especially about the movie is the fact that it doesn't try to explain the technical causes of the Financial Crisis but the psychological causes - human failures, which are the real cause for the Crisis: greed, egotism, ignorance. Many scenes in this movie deal with very little dialogue, instead the body language and the unique atmosphere speaks for itself. The ensemble is just brilliant, especially Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons.  Zachary Quinto (\\"Star Trek\\") is initially at the center of the plot as Sullivan and performs well enough in the constraining, semi-heroic role, but the veterans really stand out here beginning with Kevin Spacey, who effectively plays against type as Sam Rogers, a genuine company man, the seen-it-all head of the trading team who rallies what's left of the trading floor with corporate brio but then faces his own cross to bear struggling to commandeer a fire sale of worthless assets dumped on unsuspecting clients. The other standout is Jeremy Irons, who masterfully resuscitates the cool cunning of his Claus von Bulow from \\"Reversal of Fortune\\" as the acerbically survivalist CEO John Tuld. He handily controls the boardroom scene with cutting humor and hostile precision. One of the film's more pleasant surprises is Demi Moore in cool, brisk form as Sarah Robertson, the top risk officer and lone female executive who knows her career is at stake with the discovery of this folly. Tucci is excellent in his smallish role as Dale and gets to show off his resigned character's engineering aptitude with a brief monologue about building a bridge.  Not sure how the film will perform commercially, given the material is esoteric. If you're a film buff (and enjoy great performances) or you've been in finance, this is a must-see. Other may likely pass.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it's the best app ever. It is very easy to use. Besides reading it - you can also listen to it. It's an app that you want to use everyday.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was looking for something that was light, sturdy and didn't stand out.  This fit the bill exactly.  If you have dogs or cats in the house, it does attract hair to the inside of the cover, but other than that, its perfect.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I'm not sure I would have paid over a dollar for it...but it was a steal for free. Get this app, it's worth it.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I was intrigued to read this book which has recently spawned a popular movie. I ended up enjoying the book though I found the first third to be unnecessarily verbose as relates to descriptions of the convoluted industrialist's family which occupied a central role throughout. The Swedish names were also challenging at times. But it was worth the read (it does read fairly quickly) and I will definitely read the remaining two books of the trilogy. The two central characters were wonderful and I'm lead to believe they reappear in the next two novels.
B0068TL23G|5.0|Great fun and super addictive. Don't play this just before going to sleep, otherwise you might find sleep to be elusive. Runs fine on a Kindle Fire. Would suggest some tweaking on the UI: the control buttons are a bit small, and seem to take a bit of poking at to target. I suspect a stylus, which I don't have, would be very beneficial for playing.

B005C7SXMS|5.0|Given the fact that Submarine is prefaced by an introduction claiming that it is \\"an important film, watch it with respect,\\" I had my doubts going in. Many indie films find themselves to be far more important than they actually are. The \\"produced by Ben Stiller\\" label that can be found on the DVD cover and in the opening credits wasn't a good sign either. Films that advertise a famous person who didn't direct or star in it (though Stiller has a very minor cameo), generally do so because they don't have much else going for them. But once Submarine got started, I was blown away by the film's undeniable charm.  Submarine is told from the perspective of Oliver Tate, a young fifteen-year-old bent on saving his parents relationship and losing his virginity. Young Oliver is a genius and carries the typical pretentiousness that you might expect, but his obliviousness is countered by his vulnerability. Oliver isn't the kind of guy you would like if you went to school with him, but you can't help but feel sympathy for him as you watch him struggle with situations that he can't control.  Coming of age movies have been done for decades, but it's still incredibly satisfying when one's done properly. He struggles with girls as any fifteen year old would, but he doesn't turn to outlandish stunts to get his girlfriend Jordana, who dumped in after he struggled to offer her comfort while her mother battled cancer, back. He doesn't stand outside her window blasting Peter Gabriel from a boom box and he doesn't deliver any one-liners. His approach is rather normal. This might be unappealing to some who look to movies as an escape from reality, but indie fans will gobble this movie up.  Submarine is an incredibly clever movie, but it's powered by humor that one might find in real life. It's advertised as a biopic and it lives up to that, even if the bio is about someone that isn't famous at all. You get to know Oliver and you get to care about him. It goes beyond the struggles of a too smart for his own good teenager searching to get laid, it's a tale of humanity that anyone can relate to. You wouldn't expect a movie about a fifteen-year-old Welsh boy to carry universal appeal, but you'd be surprised.  If you like indie movies, give Submarine a shot. I still don't think it's an \\"important film\\" as it may claim to be, but it's certainly one of the most charming movies I've seen in a long time. The art of the teen film was perfected in the 80s and many films have failed to reinvent the wheel. Submarine doesn't come from the same mold as The Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles, but it does show the vulnerability that teenage years inevitably usher in. Few films enter that territory for any other reason that to get a few laughs. While I don't mean to put those films down, I appreciated Submarine's effort to accurately portray the realization of helplessness that many teenagers experience.
0316017930|5.0|This book is a must read for people who wonder why the successful people manage to climb all the why to the top. It gives the reader the understanding that every successful person needs the right opportunity and luck to be successful. Many people are misled by the society that if you are smart enough and work hard enough you will make it to the top. Knowledge and hard work is definitively required, but that is not all. The book makes it clear that people should look for opportunities. The book is written in a very entertaining way. It provides a lot of facts and surprising knowledge. The book elegant describe the different competitive advantage people can acquire, or been born into. If you have time I strongly recommend read it. However, this is not a self development book that inform you how you can succeed. It merely gives you a good idea how to approach it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Having a digital copy of the Bible is useful in many ways. The quick reference ability is invaluable. Highly recommended.
B006QPVH6O|1.0|I have to agree with most of the reviews here. I read them and thought it'd suck but I went to watch it with an open mind. I was hoping it'd be a good one. Turns out this 1 h 26 min was a complete waste of my life. Bad plot, terrible graphics, decent acting but with no story the acting doesn't matter. Actors are not to blame the writers and directors are to blame.

B0013D8LKO|2.0|It's funny, but film critics and film fans are almost afraid to criticize Stanley Kubrick. Most of the critics feel that \\"toasting\\" a Kubrick film makes the critic look \\"avant garde\\" and film fans are afraid if they say something bad about a Kubrick movie they \\"appear dull and stupid\\". This movie is disjointed, Nicole Kidman is terrible in her role and Tom Cruise is just barely better, (Cruise really can't act). The movie jumps around so much you can't fathom that it is all happening in one night; the scenes in New York City (filmed on a stage in London) look unrealistic and fake. Some of the scenes are a total waste of time and make no sense at all (Tom Cruise bullied on the street because some local college toughs think \\"he looks gay\\" has nothing at all to do with the story). It is as if Kubrick were throwing a bunch of darts at a wall to see what sticks. The acting is mediocre, with Sidney Pollack miscast (one wonders what Harvey Keitel could have done with the role, he was cast but later cut). Kubrick either hit big with his films, \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is terrific--or missed \\"Barry Lyndon\\" was terrible. This movie was neither, which is a sad finale to a career.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I enjoyed this fast paced novel from Dan Brown as much as most. Although my favorite is still Angels and Demons. The biggest issue I had with the book was the CIA working inside the United States. I thought this was forbidden by law. All in all though, an excelent read and recommended.
B004U52VPS|2.0|Love the birds, love the concept, horrible execution.  Pieces are flimsy, too hard to set up, to hard to get a hit with the catapult for anyone.  All it needed was a little quality and it would have been GREAT.  Like a sturdier more effective catapult and blocks that won't break if you sit on them the wrong way.  Instead its another example of consumer, throwaway crap... shame.
0307269191|4.0|This is the first Murakami book I've read and I'm now convinced I should read more. I decided to read this book because I've been wanting to read a Murakami book, it's short and because I tend to judge books by their covers (I liked the cover on this one).  Murakami's style is accessible, conversational and honest. I could relate to several of the insights he had and appreciated the simple, un-exaggerated way he presented his thoughts. It reads more like snippets from a journal than a typical memoir with a central point to prove. To me, that's the way to do a memoir because it aligns better with how people learn things, experience things and gain insight: picking up little things here and there while you're living your everyday life.  It's not a page turner, but it's real.

0061537969|5.0|As the story begins, there is a glimpse of how it ends.  Loyal and well loved dog passes away after a long and happy life with his family. Old Yeller, Where The Red Fern Grows, Marley and Me, no good dog story can be read without a box of tissues near by.  This book is so much more than that.  Told from the point of Enzo, this story spans his life and all of the joys and tragedies experienced by his family.  Enzo questions and explores what it means to be human, canine as well as a living being on this planet.  His owner, Denny, is a race car driver and instructor and Enzo has a lot of thoughts on the art of race car driving and how it applies to life.  I picked up this book 10 days after the passing of our beloved family dog, Ruby.  Ruby and Enzo both hailed from Eastern Washington and both served as a child's first dog, a role in life most people never forget. I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with this book, but I'm happy I did. This book made me remember just how special it was to have Ruby as part of our family.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|Now for a cheap processor this is probably 1 of the best available under 200 bucks. I bought this not quite sure what it could do and i have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. I myself have had it overclocked to 4.2 for the last 24 hours with no issue at 34c with the cpu cooler they provide.I do plan to switch to liquid cooling soon it just hasn't arrived yet. I have reached 5ghz but i don't dare to push it any farther then that because i just built this computer and would like to not burn it out yet.

B006H3MIV8|1.0|You might remember a story from a few years back that found Bob Dylan picked up by the Long Branch NJ police department for checking out several available properties around town - the only problems being the absense of a realtor and the fact that he was dressed in a trenchcoat and double hoodie that obscured his features - making several residents uncomfortable and suspicious. Upon intervening in his pre-concert stroll, the 24 y/o responding officer radioed her superiors with the immortal line - \\"This guy says he's Bob Dylan, have any of you ever heard of Bob Dylan?\\" After they finished rolling over in laughter, Dylan was cleared and released.<br /><br />I just have to wonder if the officer's best friend was somehow involved in picking the talent for the new 50th anniversary Dylan tribute, Chimes of Freedom - The Songs of Bob Dylan. My interest and appreciation of Dylan is to the point where I will routinely pick up anything he issues (many times regretting the habit.) The concept behind Chimes sounds great, new and old artists taking a shot at reinterpreting his immense and immortal canon of music - how bad could it be?<br /><br />Other reviewers have pointedly said - \\"It Sucks!\\" I probably wouldn't go that far but I can certainly see their point. Of course there are some highlights, Jackson Brown, Sting, Adele, Jeff Beck, Mark Knopfler, Johnny Cash to name a few. However, when you have to fill four discs please stop when you arrive at a talent pool that has shown little capacity to harness their own material much less Dylan's. Evan Rachel Wood, Ke$ha, Maroon 5, Miley Cyrus.... Really? Seriously?<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with drawing outside the lines and taking five decades of music for an unscripted spin. I get it. It's just that too many of these artists sound like they just returned from an archeological dig (perhaps in Long Branch) and are clueless to the fact that the fossil they're using as a beverage coaster is actually priceless.<br /><br />It's regrettable that precious and eclectic for the sake of being precious and eclectic doesn't guarantee five stars. Here's looking forward to Dylan's 100th year tribute.

1439181780|5.0|I ordered this book on a Monday after watching The Secret. It arrived in two days and I was thrilled to get it so fast. I bought the book for my son who I thought would benefit from it. I opened the book to read a little, and I could not stop. I read the complete book in about 5 hours. Anyone who wonders about the Greatest Power in the Universe and how it can change your life should read this book. It is the greatest thing I ever spent money on. I ordered a hard back copy for myself, and the book on CD for my car, for I am convinced my life has changed forever! Love and Peace to you.
0007107927|4.0|I work for a major retail store, and am also climbing the ranks there. My store manager recommended that I read this book, because it was helpful to him when dealing with people. When the book arrived, I thought I'd start reading it before bed. Not the case. I layed down for bed and read the whole book, cover to cover. I didn't know it was going to be in \\"story\\" form - which was kind of cheesy - it almost turned into the Wizard of Oz at one point. I was expecting a non-fiction book. But I must say, it was semi-helpful. I use the \\"One minute reprimands\\" and \\"One minute appraisal\\" techniques alot now, and have been complimented by other managers who overhear them, which makes me think reading this book was not a mistake!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|If you like this sort of relaxing app, like I do, it's a no brainer.<br />VERY NICE!<br />Worth 2 bucks all day long.<br />I hope this app develops further.<br />Kudos to the developer!

B004RC8NUQ|3.0|Alright, reviewing the actual movie: Typical RomCom. Guy falls in love with girl, girl only likes guy. Blah blah blah. We've seen these types of movies before. No Strings Attached is not a bad RomCom, nor a great RomCom. Right in the middle really.  Although what I really want to talk about is the crazy, bi-polar, and ridiculously screwed up character that Natalie Portman plays. The constant back and forth between wanting more, then wanting less just drove me crazy. It seriously reminded me of the bi-polar and unstable patients I met during my nursing career. Just wanted to get that out there. The character she portrays in this movie needs some serious help.  That is all! Check it out if you want, some might be disappointed, others might enjoy it. Tough call on this one!

B00181YT9S|5.0|I have had powered monitor speakers on my \\"someday\\" list for years.  I use headphones while I do my audio work, but I sometimes need to play my results for others.  I have my computer hooked into my component stereo for when I need to do that.  But I have always hoped to some day have a nice pair of powered computer monitors.  Of course I've used the cheap ones that sound, well, cheap.  So that's why I plug my computer at home into my stereo.  It wasn't until I got involved in video production that I found what I was looking for in the MS20 pair, which was part of a Mac workstation that had been assembled as the best possible solution with a practical budget in mind.  The CPU had to be high-end, and for running FCP, a powerful Mac was a given.  The people that put together the workstation decided to have powered computer monitors in the Mac alcoves, rather than the headphones that were supplied at the PC workstations in a row on an open counter.  I was skeptical, because price-wise, Behringer is not high-priced gear.  But quality-wise, I have always found their products quite competitive at any price.  It's as if the product development team at Behringer actually get out and use the gear they produce.  Imagine that!  But I digress.  If you are looking for high-end home theater sound, the MS20 may leave you wishing for more.  But if you are used to listening to your work on typical computer speakers, you are in for a pleasant surprise.  If you need to fill a cubicle-size room with good sound, get the MS20 and you're set.  If you need to fill a classroom or a lecture hall on a regular basis, you might need to spend more and get the MS40.  It all depends on your listening environment.  Most of the time I am on headphones when I do my editing.  I seldom need to play my work for more than a few people at a time.  My position in the video production team is usually audio.  At home, my MS20 monitors are used to give room sound to an audio production setup where I feed a keyboard into a multi-track digital recorder.  It's nice to hear what I have done before I import it into the computer for further editing.
1576875776|3.0|I was very pleased to finally see some of Vivian Maier's work published.  Thank you to all who worked to make that happen with this book.  The book's simple design and repro work is fine.  But..if only the (source) printing work had been done more skillfully.  Many of the images looks like they came from poor amateur scans of poor amateur inkjet prints.  Contrast is painfully high, removing all tonal subtlety from many images.  And who thought that warm-toning these images was a good idea?  Ugh!  Perhaps one day, after more of Vivian's work in uncovered a mature and professional hand will take charge of producing another book of her work.  With prominent photo dealers like Howard Greenberg now involved (in showing her work) my hopes are high.  Until then, however, this is what we have.  It's certainly better than nothing.  But that's about the best I can say about this book.

B006OB3K56|5.0|I was mesmerised watching this film.  Michael Fassbender, who was robbed of the best actor oscar nomination, is pure perfection.  Shame is a harrowing, disturbing and unsettling look at what happens when one becomes a slave to his or her addiction.  Michael Fassbender delivers a tour de force performance as a damaged, upwardly mobile sex addict living in Manhattan.  Carey Mulligan, who was also robbed of an oscar nomination, plays Brandon's equally damaged sister and is fantastic as well.  I was horrified, saddened and fascinated watching this incredible work of art.  There are many unanswered questions as to what happened between Brandon and his sister when they were younger.  They have a  very disturbing relationship that raises a great deal of questions. Then there are Brandons' sexcapades and  inability to connect on an emotional level.  There is something slightly Patrick Batemanish about Brandon for those of you who have read and seen American Psycho.  The ice cold personality, the impeccable clothes and apartment. Brandon, of course is not a psychotic killer.   Some have referred to Brandon as a deviant or monster.  I think not.  This is someone who needs help for emotional problems.  My heart broke when his attempt at having a normal relationship fails in the worst possible way. If you think this film is sex, sex, sex think again. This film is not erotic nor is it sexy. Shame is not an easy film to watch. I remember sitting in the theater and not being able to look at the screen.  The sex is graphic and so is the nudity.  However both are not gratuitous and are tastefully shot.  I studied human behavior for four years in college but the jury was always out on sex addiction.  This film has convinced me. Steve McQueen delivers another masterpiece on par with the magnificent Hunger.  Shame is a must see for anyone who likes serious, thought provoking films that explore human behavior and relationships.
B000O5AYCA|3.0|Boxer is one of those albums that's perfect for background music, and every so often you'll hum some of the vocal melodies, but the album overall is honestly not NEARLY as memorable as the 80-plus reviews here will have you believe.  The lead singer rarely (if ever) branches beyond that \\"calmly pleasant\\" vocal style and presents listeners with vocal melodies that are average at best.  I believe the singer was influenced by Bruce Springsteen's early work, or perhaps Bob Dylan's early work for that matter but lacks the charisma to stand out.  I hear a slightly similar sound in his voice to these two legendary artists.  He's not bad of course, and the band isn't awful either.  Far from it.  Still, after several listens, \\"Gospel\\" is the only song that really connects with me.  The rest is just pleasant filler.  You'll probably like it more than I do.
1466401885|1.0|I love reading stories about how opposites attract like \\"Things Change\\" by Patrick Jones. I expected to love this book too but i didn't. I felt thrown right into the story and i found things were not explained.  **Spoiler Alert**  The back of the book gave me the impression that she was little miss goody two shoes. But in the first few chapters i found that that wasn't the case. I read the back of the book and it said that Abby doesn't drink. However, in chapter 3, she drinks. No one forced her to. (contradiction much?).She also almost kissed a guy she just met and danced promiscuously with Travis. I'd blame it on the alcohol but she was apparently sober enough to know what she was doing. And right from the start, she goes to a fight club! She stays with and sleeps (just sleeps) with Travis. Good girls don't really do that. I also felt that the story didn't really lead into the \\"dislike\\" Abby has for Travis. It was annoying because i couldn't really couldn't feel empathy for her. He seemed like a nice guy. The fact that Travis calls her \\"pidge\\" is annoying aswell. I couldn't help but picture \\"Lady and the Tramp\\"  ****  I expected the shy, down-to-earth, book worm girl. Abby was not that girl. The author should change the book's description as it is misleading. If you are looking for truly good girl and bad boy truly hating each other at first, this is not the book for you.
B000001FGG|3.0|Hey it took me long enough to finally hear Wheels of Fire considering the enormous amount of praise I've been hearing about, but the wait is now over and it turns out I enjoy about 75% of the album.  Basically you have one half devoted to the studio side of Cream, and their live jammy side is captured on the second disc.  Despite my 3-star rating, it's actually because \\"Toad\\" and \\"Traintime\\" are weak and unnecessary to me, and that clocks in at around 24 minutes of music.  Let's start with the live material, shall we?  \\"Spoonful\\" doesn't hit the mark with the vocals like in the studio version because this version lacks punch for whatever reason, however that's the ONLY thing lacking because \\"Spoonful\\" makes up for that with a really lengthy and highly enjoyable guitar jam.  It's not much different from the jams I've heard Cream attempt such as on Live Cream for example, and in fact speaking of Live Cream, the jam from \\"N.S.U\\" and the one on this version of \\"Spoonful\\" definitely strike me as being performed in an identical way.  Maybe not the same note for note, but close enough.  However, the good news is that it's impossible to ignore that much of it is in fact quite melodic, which probably explains why everyone loves it so much.  \\"Toad\\" starts off with a smoky barroom-like guitar solo before quickly switching into an extended 14-minute drum solo.  Normally drum solos are one of the LAST things I want to hear, but you know, this one actually has its share of memorable moments.  Right around the 10-minute mark especially (when the drums resemble African tribal dancing) is probably my favorite part.  Still, a good 5 minutes needs to be trimmed, if not more (such as right around the 11-minute mark- THIS is when it starts to become overkill and should have ended right there).  \\"Crossroads\\" is a popular song for a reason (this version especially).  It takes the heavy blues rock formula and makes it super catchy.  Its appeal is hard to explain too since the entire song is based around a guitar riff that's honestly not THAT great.  \\"Traintime\\" is a bluesy song with lots of harmonica and drums, but something feels slightly off about it.  The way the drums plod along is sort of uninteresting, the harmonica repeats the same few notes too many times, and the vocals feel rushed.  I don't know, I can't get into this one.  As for the studio stuff, THIS is where I'm blown away (well, \\"Spoonful\\" blows me away too, I admit).  \\"White Room\\" is the best song the band ever made.  Everything about the vocal melody, to the fierce drum work, to the guitar solo at the end, to the dramatic heart-breaking line \\"I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines, wait in the dark where the shadows run from themselves\\" is a MAGNIFICENT song.  The atmosphere always reminded me of being stuck in a rundown prison somewhere that's extremely hot.  \\"Politician\\" has a super heavy guitar riff that probably influenced Black Sabbath.  I say \\"probably\\" because I know Bill Ward was a fan of Cream at least- not sure about the other band members.  \\"Sitting On Top of the World\\" has a fantastic vocal melody.  It also has a guitar riff that's pretty darn heavy by late 60's standards, and it holds up amazingly well.  \\"Passing the Time\\" has a gentle flower power-like vocal melody that's a pretty drastic departure from the rest of the album.  Reminds me of the Zombies or Love without the refined songwriting approach to make it really excel.  Still, it's enjoyable.  \\"As You Said\\" is another experiment, this one being an unusual psychedelic tune that has elements of the Beatles classic \\"The Inner Light\\" as far as spooky atmosphere is concerned.  The way the guitar plods along is another strange element to the songs, well, strange nature.  Not sure what to think about the verse melody though.  It's good enough I suppose.  \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" contains one of my favorite verse melodies, even though it's questionable whether it's really being SUNG or not.  The melodic background arrangements really enhance the lyrics and atmosphere.  \\"Those Were the Days\\" is *awesome* too!  The lyrics about Atlantis and the soaring/angelic way the vocals lead into the catchy drum work is a thing of brilliance.  \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" is something I've always been skeptical about given my less than spectacular luck.  Quality vocal work and lyrics.  \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\" is one of those songs that REALLY reminds me of childhood memories.  Not sure why.  The vocal delivery just sails and plays with my emotions exactly the right way to give me feelings of nostalgia and daydreaming adventures.  Overall, the studio stuff is extremely fantastic.  The live stuff?  Well it's an acquired taste to be honest, and besides \\"Spoonful\\" the rest of it fails to make an impression on me, hence the 3.5-star rating.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|Lately I find myself on a quest to find things that don't suck.  It would be nice if books, movies, etc could just be good, but so many are terrible that simply not sucking is an achievement in itself.  In that context, I watched Easy A - not really expecting a good movie, but crossing my fingers and hoping that at the very least I'd have a couple of hours of entertainment that were tolerable.  Thankfully, Easy A exceeded my expectations.  Easy A gets 4 stars.  Coming from me, that's pretty good.  I reserve 5 star rankings for only the very best.  For example, Animal House and Caddy Shack would get 5 stars.  Easy A doesn't reach that level, but it was an entertaining movie and worth the time.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am completely addicted to Angry Birds of any kind! I love when I see that I got an update.  This Rio version is fun because it's so different from the others.  Same concept, but different backgrounds and situations.  I hope they keep making more Angry Birds updates, or I will be so sad! It's crazy how a game of shooting pigs with birds could be addicting!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a fantastic app. It is very intuitive to use. Very versitle. The best Bible app that I have used. It is even better than any Bible download that I have paid for Thank you for an amazing app. Well done.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is a fun game...very addicting! It's especially fun to play it on an iPad.  My kids take my iPad to play games, and this is one that they love! It's challenging and yet still fun! It's good to practice eye hand coordination and this game definitely does that!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has lots of games to play. some fun some not so fun. so I would recamend it cause its got a lot of games in one swoop.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I found this game and wasn't sure what is really was.  Once I got started I had a hard time putting it down.  I got my daughter playing it to.  I like it because it's challenging physically and mentally, but not so difficult as to get frustrated.  I would recommend it to anyone!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very useful and work really fast.  Makes it easy to mess with my computer when I am in another part of the house.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie after the first was so amazing, but it is a let down. DO NOT BUY!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have owned every type of media or format that these movies have come out on. Every format gets better and better and I have to say that this is the best these movies are going to look for quite a while. The movies are predominately dark anyway but I can see a big difference from the Alien Quadrilogy set. There is alot more detail to every scene and overall it looks tack sharp. If you are thinking about buying it and worrying whether it is worth a double dip - I would say yes indeed it is worth the double dip. These movies look great and the audio sounds very good as you can hear everything. I have not had any problem with these in my machine and they look great. Highly Recommended
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it been fun playing the games &amp;getting to unlock new games.  I like that they are quick games for when I have a couple of minutes. to waste.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|The movie works great and it got to me really fast! Also I recommend Real Steel, this movie will knock you off your feet!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Plain and simple looking cover, I like that it helps clean the Kindle's screen while covered. Its well rounded edges help prevent your Kindle fire's corners from being subject to the odd knock. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase; excellent product for the price!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Normally I don't get caught in the plots of novels as quick as I did with the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The Story involves different times and ways of human exploitation. The teenager protagonist is charming and it is easy to like her. The use of kids as weapons immediately will make you angry.<br /><br />I'm already in the first half of the 3rd volume (Mockingjay) and I love the development of the characters and where the story is headed.<br /><br />I applause the author for the clever way to tell a story that normally would shock anybody, the different faces of the human nature are well described as the pages go by. I hope the movie adaptation makes it up to this novel.
B00133KFGW|5.0|[[ASIN:B00133KFGW August Rush]]<br />I saw this movie for the first time on TV and absolutely loved it. I loved it so much that I went to Amazon half way through and bought it. I bought a used copy and it was shipped quickly and in very good condition. Some might think it's corny and slightly predictable but I found it refreshing and a movie to just lighten your heart.
1583334386|4.0|Everything you thought you knew about willpower, how you make decisions, and the best ways to keep your resolutions is wrong. At least that is what it feels like after reading this book. McGonigal goes over research on willpower and reveals the various traps we put ourselves in and why we find it so hard to keep certain goals and break certain habits.  Each chapter outlines an area of research and gives several ideas on how to gain a better understanding about your own particular weaknesses and how to overcome them. This is not a typical \\"self help\\" book that promises you success if you follow a certain plan. Instead, McGonigal offers suggestions on how to face our inevitable failures and how to make it more likely that we will meet with success.  The book is entertaining and easy to read. If there is a weakness, it is that McGonigal sometimes tries too hard to be humorous. There are notes in the back of the book that cite the research she employes, but sometimes it isn't easy to tell what research goes with which anecdote. These are minor caveats, though, to a very interesting book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the best game ever I love all the Minni game lots of fun u have to try it its quit enteresting I wish they would make another on even better
B006E4QCXU|5.0|My Device: Kindle Fire.  App Version: 1.01<br /><br />I was lucky enough to get this free, but this is an app worth paying for. Runs Well and loot's great. A great way to relax and waste time.<br /><br />Suggestions:<br />- Perhaps add an option for other interesting starting configurations ( other than a grid)<br />- I don't know how this would work, but being able to put down 'planets' or some with larger attraction/repel would be interesting.... set up a system and watch the particles orbit or repel from them
0307719774|5.0|i just love this journal. i just received it today, and i excitedly opened it to February 2nd, \\"who do you live with?\\" i laughed at the simplicity of the question; but when you think about the fact that this is a FIVE YEAR journal; it's such a great question. who knows what my living arrangements will be 5 years from now; and it was cool to think about the possibilities of the future. i almost can't wait to answer all the questions.<br />for those people who have complained about the size of the book; yes its small. but not as small as i was expecting based on the complaining reviews! there's not much room for your answer so you're only writing in it for like 30 seconds anyway! and i didn't even find it all that difficult to write in.<br />bottom line, this journal EXCEEDED my expectations and i can't wait to treasure it. i will probably end up buying another one 5 years from now, and several more along the way as gifts for friends.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Though I appreciate the obvious work put into this app, I simply don't see a reason to keep it on my tablet. I was amused for only a few moments, then I quickly lost interest. I suppose if I didn't have much else to focus my attention this might be something to keep.
B0071NLG0W|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! I love this series and the author always leaves me wanting more!! I loved the mystery and pre wedding jitters an second thoughts, as well as Amber and her crazy but hilarious family. Full of mystery, twists and wow moments you will not be disappointed! I also loved that Romeo was in the book! I can't decide who I like better Romeo or Brad! Also gotta love Hacker and Tia!  Highly recommended
1439108277|5.0|I initially heard a review on PBS and then got the book from the library.  It was so good for an old codger like me who first had physics 60 years ago that I bought it and have recommended it to many others.  What knowledge and can make it so understandable.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, when i purchased it i didn't realize that it was written as a young adult book, but enjoyed it none the less
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Overall, it has a cheap feel to it. But alas, it was cheap. I wish they used a AAA battery instead of AG13 as well. It's just a fun toy to sit around watching the Doctor with.
B006IGZWB2|3.0|I loved the book.  Loved, loved, loved it.  That is why I was so excited to see the movie.  I wanted to love the movie just as much.  I was pretty disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the actors were fabulous, the sets were gorgeous and it was shot very well.  What I didn't like is how much they left out from the book.  The characters in the movie were far too simplistic and they left so many stories out about the characters.  There were also a lot of very funny lines left out that I thought for sure would be in the movie because they were so original.  I realize that no movie can truly compare to the book, but I think the movie producers could have done better.  I was disappointed by the lack of depth.  Maybe if I hadn't read the book first, I would have liked the movie much more.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app. I think u should get it. Its so much fun. I love it because it has all kinds of different  levels. I only found 5 golden eggs. Can someone please tell me where the rest are at. You should get this.
B004LUS390|1.0|Loved this program for about 3 weeks...then it crashed.  Won't work at all on the Kindle Fire....wondering if Autodesk will respond and support this platform.  I would buy it again in a second if I could get someone to tell me it works.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Just a quick note to say I'm happy with this product. My 10 year old son uses it every day. It's held up so far with no signs of wear.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The amount of effort that has gone into building this app shows why it is a top pick among all of the Bible apps.  Take some time to scroll through the numerous translations, study tools, and reading plans. This is a true blessing for the sons and daughters of God. We have his word right here at our fingertips at any time of the day!
B00486070K|1.0|I put up this review on Apple's website on Jan 27, 2012, which is where I bought this thing from. I'm also putting it here.  This stupid adapter is only capable of \\"Fast Ethernet\\" (100Mbps), which is about 12.5MB/s maximum, but never went faster than 9MB/s for me. USB 2.0 can go as fast as 45MB/s. This adapter is only good if you only use your Macbook Air for updating your facebook or something like that. Too slow for anything else.  Search Amazon for a USB to Ethernet adapter that is NOT Apple branded and can do \\"Gigabit Ethernet\\" (1000Mbps). That will allow for better Airplay functionality and much faster (500%) file transfer speeds.  One such device here on Amazon is \\"Plugable USB 2.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Network Adapter (ASIX AX88178 Chipset)\\"  Selling an Ethernet adapter that is not capable of 1 gigabit speeds at this day and age and at this price is shame.  Also, as of Mac OS X 10.6.6, this adapter will only work with the Macbook Air, and no other Apple product. I used one of these for a Mac Pro before that had both of it's NICs fried. Updating to 10.6.8 made this thing unusable on that machine. Haven't tried it with Lion yet. Will report back when I get my 17\\" Macbook Pro (late 2011) with Lion and test this out. Not letting Lion anywhere near my company's Mac Pros since it's still half baked.  Apple, you are slipping!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a really good game but a little hard in some places. But over all a grate game. If your thinking of getting it do!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love, this app. Great graphics. Every part is wonderful. No complaints. I refer to it often. And great that it is free.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Absolutely the best weather app on any market. I originally got this app for the widget, but I have learned this is one of the most comprehensive weather apps there is. Also, the widgets provide more information regarding weather conditions than any other weather widgets I've seen. If you're concerned about the weather, you need this app.
B0058VW36U|2.0|wouldn't download to my kindle fire so now I'm calling amazon for a refund! very disappointed was looking forward to playing.
B003R0LBVW|3.0|In Alan Pakula's \\"The Devil's Own\\", Tom o'Meara (Harrison Ford) asks Rory Devaney (Brad Pitt) what is the good end of his story (the cruel events that led Rory to join the IRA). Rory says there is no good end for his story, and he adds \\"this is not an American story, it's an Irish one\\".  There is a tale around here (I come from Madrid) that American movies have to end well, possibly just to ensure a good record at the box office. Whether it is true or not, some examples seem to back this theory, like Edward Zwick's  \\"The Last Samurai\\" where a beautiful portrait of a whole philosophy of life is spoiled by an absurd unnecessary final scene.  Having read Frantzen's \\"Freedom\\" (with the excellent help of the New Oxford American dictionary which contains virtually every U.S. slang word and every bird species' name) I got the impression that the above is valid for books, too. Otherwise it is hard to explain how such a dense, well-narrated story of unsecure self-injuring characters can turn in just a few paragraphs into a lovely middle-class nothing-has-happened family which can move from hating to loving katz in no time.  I managed to forbear Joey's transformation from a paradigm psychopath to a good samaritan with ethical remords (oh God!), but the end is so appalling that I can only think of a worse example, namely Neville's \\"The Eight\\" when a bunch of masterbrains decide a centuries-old intellectual battle with a street fist fight.  Sorry Jonathan, I have truly enjoyed 98% (exactly so, according to Kindle's progression mark) of your book and I see you can tell very good stories in a masterful style, but for me endings are important and this ending prevents me from trying any of your books in the future.
B000UD08HW|1.0|As a great BluRay Concerts Collector (more than 80), and a big fan of all time of David Gilmour and Pink Floyd, can tell you this is a piece of junk just because of the picture and sound quality. Dont bother yourself buying this....instead get the DVD one, less expensive and the same quality. Its a shame this great concert was not filmed on high quality for a true BluRay presentation.<br /><br />Please, guys, dont do this again. Huge fans do not deserve this.<br /><br />Take a look to the recently released \\"Lady Gaga at Madison NY BluRay Concert\\"....then you'll see what i'm talking about in terms of stunning picture and sound a BluRay should perform!!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I never thought I would care about the phases of the moon, and now I check it every day. Plus, I sound like a total smartypants when I start using terms like 'gibbous'.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins writes and I read. Never did I think I would enjoy reading a book that featured giant talking rats and bats, but the author writes so well she could probably write about packs of talking trash cans, and I would read it. Of course, non of these appear in The Hunger Games. Very entertaining reading.
B003ASLJS6|3.0|Clint should've stuck with the Dirty Harry series at this point in his career. This movie and it's premise was nothing special. Worth a watching, but I'd advise against buying it even for $6.
B004EPZ08Y|4.0|WARNING! There are spoilers in the last paragraph!!! If you haven't seen it, don't read that paragraph!!!<br /><br />So I haven't really watched all of the 'Final Destination'  movies. But I've seen....this one. And the one with a roller coaster and uhh yeah. I don't understand this one, like it completely confused me. I don't get it so I'm hoping someone can answer some of my questions who is more involved in the movies or at least has seen them all. Overall, it wasn't a bad movie but it was anything special. It's the exact same as all the other movies, some person has a premonition and saves a bunch of people from death and then they all die in a gruesome way in the order they died in the movie.<br /><br />'Final Destination 5' is about this guy and he saves people from a bridge collapse. The only thing that I really like about the 'Final Destination' movies are the deaths. You can always expect them to be inventive and completely ridiculous...in a good way. Hands down, the deaths are the best part. The thing I liked about this one compared to the other one is that it makes you think the people are going to die one way but then they completely flip it around so it's not what you expect.<br /><br />Overall, 'Final Destination 5' wasn't terrible but it wasn't amaze-balls either. One of the questions I'd like someone to answer, there is this guy in the movie...he plays the coroner right. And so they ask him what's going on and he's all \\"You can't cheat death, blah, blah, blah. I've seen this once before!\\" But then, at the end of the movie, some of the survivors die in the plane crash from the first movie? That confuses me SO much lol. Like, how has he seen it before if this movie is supposed to be before the first movie? I still don't get it. I've never seen the first movie but....I'm still confused...and I don't want to buy it lol. Explanations would be much appreciated!
B006VA3ZEG|5.0|The best way I can put it is that it is like a book you cannot put down. The second season came out and I watched all five episodes in two days. I was up into the wee hours last night because the end of each episode FORCED me to watch the next, until they were gone. :(  Watching it has made me feel things like almost painful hatred for a character, then perhaps forgiveness and compassion for them, hope, suspense, love, confusion, sadness. Those seeing these good reviews are probably intrigued enough to try the series. Enjoy!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Movie was terrible. Do not recommend. Whatever you do, do not buy this movie. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY!
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|Drake did his thing. I really like his work. But it where a couple of tracs where I felt he was singing entirely to much. But some people may like that and thats cool. But harmonizing a lil on the trac aint bad, 4 real 4 real singing is not a good look. Just my personal opinion. I liked it as a whole body of work though.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased this case because of the hard cover. Love it!! I got pink, but will be getting another one soon so I can change up on the colors.  Great fit & works for what I need.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I will say that this app is very relaxing as well as engaging, you can find yourself amazed by the beautiful colors and effects.<br />AWESOME APP!!!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|AWESOME!! I don't know if it's because I am fascinated by space already, but this is one of the coolest things (not just apps!) I've ever messed around with. Third only to girls and an electron microscope (I'm not saying which comes first). And for two bucks?! Nice work!
B004I744AS|5.0|Best dictionary I've downloaded. Can also be used offline! Very detailed definitions. I highly recommend this app to everyone who needs a good reference app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game! !! Love playing it, great way to waste time. Should get more stars because it has woo many games in one for free!! awesome!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|First one was decent, do your self a favour and not spend money at all on this.. Watch something better..
B006ZNRD06|1.0|The app crashes frequently and, when it does manage to play a video, the sound is badly out of sync with the picture. May work on other devices but not on the Fire.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I was a little worried when I read some of the negative reviews about this cover....glad I didn't listen! Its true that the straps are a bit snug but I didn't have any problems getting the kindle in it and I know I won't have to worry about them being too loose and it falling out. The other issue about the cover not laying flat? I found that if I kept laying the kindle with the cover side facing down after a couple of days it started to lay flat.  It may not be real leather but it certainly doesn't feel cheap either and I've already recieved compliments on it and asked where I bought it. I love the way it looks and especially how I can keep the case on when I have the kindle plugged in to charge....Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase. On top of that I ordered it on a Wednesday and it was sitting on my doorstep that Friday and I had selected the free super saver shipping that normally takes a few business days....awesome!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Despite the green check in the compatibility box, this app doesn't work on the Kindle Fire. The Fire really needs a decent app that will play multiple formats of video files but this isn't it.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|I rate the four tracks on this EP as five stars. Any of these four tracks could have been part of the Death Magnetic CD. I must say I love Metallica and that I have all their albums and videos. I really, really, really love this band! Fortunately, both Megadeth and Anthrax released excellent CD's (\\"Th1rt3en\\" and \\"Worship Music\\") a few months ago, so that we got new material to listen to from The Big Three. If you love Metallica I think you should try to listen to TRIVIUM too. TRIVIUM has already released five studio albums, the last one called \\"In Waves\\" (2011). Matt Heafy (TRIVIUM's lead vocals and guitar)  reminds me of James Hetfield, but something like twenty years younger. Mastodon and Lamb of God are also good bands and I recommend their albums too. Anyway, if you love Metal than Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Dio, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, WASP, Slayer, Yngwie Malmsteen, Testament, Rush, Lita Ford, Scorpions, Tony Martin, Rainbow, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple are all great bands to listen to. Buy their albums! Don't copy them!
B005K17RU0|2.0|First off, there's no control for the dock display so I guess it picks some location near me as good enough.  Then maybe the temp on the pulldown menu matches the tool, maybe not.  Just now, it gave errors trying to refresh data.  Kinda sad...
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Things this app is not : A game, science and you might make a case that it's loosely related to an arty experience. It's simply a neat app that entertains you for a short while, then just takes up space on your device.  And leave it to the New York Times to say that it &quot;awakens an avatar -like sensitivity&quot; &quot;electricity in the body&quot; &quot;soothing&quot; and &quot;general connectedness&quot;. That just makes me throw up in my mouth. I'm part amused and part insulted.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I read this book a while back. When I saw it had been made into a movie, I ignored it at first, thinking it couldn't possibly be very exciting. When I saw how many 5 star reviews it had gotten after a few months though I decided to give it a try. If anything it's better than the book. The book didn't make me cry.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that stays with you for a very long time. Give it a chance!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Great work by developer. Can save as desktop wallpaper by doing a screen shot, then using that as your background (duh). People learn how to use your device and don't blame the dev for your OE. Actually a save as wallpaper feature would be nice but this app is 5 stars on its own.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app works great on both my kindle fire and my htc inspire. I would reccomend this app to anyone who enjoys a good solitaire game.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|It was a quick and easy read.  Some parts were good - I see how it all works.  But I was surprised at how extreme it was.  Can people in the midwest with children desiring a warm, inviting home for guests & other children really get rid of it all? I can't imagine the living space without a tv and a couch and beautiful pictures on the wall as well as photos of my family.  So I guess you have to be in the extreme simplistic lifestyle to really match up with this book's ideas. I do agree with keeping just the things you need, even though with a family & occasional entertaining I find I have to keep a lot of kitchen items you only need once a month or every other!  I guess I'm saying it just doesn't fit some people's lifestyles, even if we'd secretly like it to!!
B005VMSATA|4.0|This was an entertaining movie that could have used more science fiction and less romance.  Growing up with comic books, it's been a great few years seeing production companies promoting Marvel and DC superheroes to the big screen.  Reynolds is a good Green Lantern, but I feel they're bending the character to his persona versus the other way around.  CGI is good and storyline was informative to the GL newcomers.  The story has been set for number 2, so hopefully producers make the most of it.
B000002P2W|4.0|Who By Numbers is an album I find to be eclectic within the Who's previously powerful outputs of Quadrophenia, Who's Next and Tommy and is much more simpler, yet all the more a strong effort from the group and on Townshend's behalf; and why shouldn't it be a little more simpler? It is although, seemingly, as most of the lyrics can be interpreted as addressing the problems of getting older and the reprecussions of being a celebrity, if one digs through certain lyrical references.  By this point, Townshend and the Who were in order for a break at the end of supporting this effort, but the material stands up today as quite an achievement. Slip Kid begins with a 6/8 time signature and the band crash in accordingly with a track that has all of the elements of the Who firing off on the essential cylinders, backed by a lyrical reference of \\"there's no easy way to be free\\", while drawing the parallels of a kid at 13 and the older man at 63. However Much I Booze tells another tale of desperation here in which the reference is \\"there ain't no way out\\". Apparently, Pete was reflecting on his life in this time period with very dim and tired eyes it seems. Imagine a Man is bittersweet in its delivery and its title starkingly accords to the music that has been arranged as its extremely sparse, melancholy, yet brave also.  Squeeze Box is a simple number which features Pete taking a banjo solo as opposed to the standard electric guitar break! And is a jigging, bouncy type of tune that hit the top twenty chart upon its release and became a live favorite on the tour. Blue, Red and Grey features Townshend on vocal and plays a ukulele accompanied by a horn arrangement, that offers a brighter view in this fun little number. John Entwistle offers up Success Story, a tight little rocker which references a semi-autobiography of the band's life, tongue in cheek, mind you. Dreaming From the Waist and In a Hand or a Face join Slip Kid and Success Story in the more rocking side of things, while addressing a more cynical, cryptic at times, look upon life and all of its peaks and valleys one has to endure to achieve some sort of understanding to it all. Pretty tough stuff, there! Performance wise, Moon was still at the peak of his powers before faltering off with the impending haze of alcohol that would ultimately, lead to his undoing. Entwistle's bass playing is as powerful, prolific and propelling as ever as he adds the depth to numbers like Slip Kid, In a Hand Or a Face, Dreaming from the Waist and However Much I Booze with amazing dexterity. Daltrey's vocals are robust with energy and a defiant sense of conquer despite the lyrics Pete had written for the record, a problem that would arise on the follow-up Who Are You set. Still, though, Daltrey's voice has always been a welcomed power and style that defines 1/4 the sound the Who.  Who By Numbers is more of a personal and psychological update within Townshend and the Who camp that succeeds well in its intents as a mid-life album that sometimes can be depressing, yet all the more interesting as well. 4 stars

B000002P6R|4.0|After the death of Keith Moon, the Who soldiered on and recruited former Small Faces/Faces drummer Kenny Jones as Moon's replacement and continued performing live up until late '82 before suspending band activity for an indefinite hiatus. Choosing famed producer Bill Szymczyk(Joe Walsh, the Eagles, Elvin Bishop), the Who worked on Face Dances over a 5 month period at Odyssey Studios in London and despite some critical objections, the album pushed its way into the top 5 and produce a top 20 single in You Better, You Bet, which consolidated the Who's updated sound for the 1980s. After the release of Townshend's Empty Glass and success of the single Let My Love Open the Door from the previous year, many claimed that Face Dances really didn't sound very Who-ish and was merely an extension of Townshend's solo work with the members of the Who as back-up musicians. This is simply not true to my ears, as I hear a revitalized band that has gained a second momentum to survive, at least for the few more years that remained for itself, and does so accordingly.  Pop sensibility and a somewhat New wave influence permeates throughout Townshend and the group's collective sound which culminates in a forward moving fashion with tracks like You Better, You Bet, Don't Let Go the Coat and Daily Records displaying a totally revamped and modified sound for the band. Gone, of course, is the maniacal drumming of Moon in exchange for the more contemporary, but just as powerful, drumming skills of Jones and I think he does a credible job throughout the recording. Entwistle weighs in with the heavier tracks on the record in the ripping Quiet One, where he sings lead, and the short, sharp, snappiness of You rendered by a powerful vocal from Daltrey.  Townshend offers a variatable sense of nuances within his songwriting and it comes to the fore on tracks like Cache Cache, Did You Steal My Money(which utilizes stereo mixing to a high advantage) and Daily Records which are compelling numbers and show a significant amount of growth within Pete's songwriting skills. How Can You Do It Alone seems a bit banal at times and slightly pedestrian in its delivery, but still maintains a fresh poppy feel within itself. John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick adds a fifth element with his keyboard contributions all over this record and songs that benefit greatly from his presence are You Better, You Bet, Daily Records, Did You Steal My Money and the record's closer Another Tricky Day, which is one of the more consistently powerful numbers on offer here. Even though the Who were entering the final stages of their 18 year career, Face Dances proves that the band could, in fact, remain relevant to an ever changing genre of music and do it with the strength and wisdom of a well weathered and refined rock outfit. 4 stars

B000059T1G|3.0|Hold on before anyone might misunderstand me on my review title: I like Last Exit for what it offers, even though Mason only appears on two cuts, not to mention the fact that Traffic had ceased by the time this was released, anyways; it is an interesting footnote on the first phase of the group and features some strong tracks in Mason's Just For You(a solo B-side that was augmented by the rest of the band on this version) which contains the typical Mr. Fantasy vibe that was displayed on that debut with a folky/psychedelic tinge in its songcraft and the  exceptional flute playing of Chris Wood. Winwood's Shanghai Noodle Factory recalls a bit of Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring from the self-titled second album in its melody and impact, with further accompaniment from Wood on the flute. Something's Got a Hold of My Toe is a cutting-room instrumental that was picked to fill the album, really; despite some interesting guitar licks from Mason and an upbeat jam quality, its shoehorned in the tracklist.  Withering Tree is a piano driven Winwood cut that offers a chilly ambience to its melody arrangement, once again complimented by the great flute playing of Chris Wood. Medicated Goo is a grooving rocker that would later open '71's Welcome to the Canteen and provides some exceptional guitar playing from the vastly talented Winwood and the solid drumming of Jim Capaldi. Feelin Good and Blind Man are taken from a show at the Fillmore West when Traffic had been finishing up gigs without Mason and are strong covers that come across competently and with confidence; though one misses the fourth element, at times of a guitar, as these numbers are essentially sax and organ fueled workouts to compensate for that void, the trio of Winwood, Capaldi and Wood pull it off well. The construction of this album is really more for serious Traffic fans, rather than casual ones, despite the uneveness and lack of cohesion here. 3 and a half stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun game and easy to learn how to play! great way to pass the time and have fun with it too
B000059T1E|4.0|Although this finished album began life as a solo effort from Steve Winwood, John Barleycorn Must Die is an amazing kickstart for phase II of Traffic, along with its successor Low Spark of Hi-Heeled Boys, making for an era that rivals the previous incarnation of musical interest and merit. Winwood worked with Guy Stevens whom was set to produce Winwood's debut solo album(working title Mad Shadows, the title eventually used by Guy's protege's Mott the Hoople) but after a brief time, the sessions were scrapped and as Winwood's former colleagues in Traffic(Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood) returned to the fold, Steve elected to produce the record himself along with help from Island label owner Chris Blackwell. The songs that did emerge from the Winwood/Stevens sessions, however showed off his virtuosity and sense of masterful songwriting in Stranger to Himself(All instruments played by Steve) and Every Mothers Son, with help from Capaldi on drums. Included in the remaster edition is Sittin Here Thinkin of My Love, an outtake from the same Stevens sessions, although its easy to see why it was left on the cutting-room floor, as its a bit subpar lacking in overall substance.  Largely a collaboration between Capaldi and Winwood in songcrafts, John Barleycorn is a record wherein Steve Winwood takes the reins on this phase of the group and is duly honorable in furthering his talents as a songwriter and musician. the opening salvo of Glad is a piano/sax driven track that has elements of soul and jazz interlaid, leading into the more darker aspects of Freedom Rider which takes its cues from Glad's musical flavor and adds more depth within the duration of this number. Empty Pages is domineered by Winwood's organ and electric piano arrangement and Capaldi's tightly knit kit beats which makes for a delightful listen. The title track is rendered an acoustic folk arrangement with the ominous flute of Chris Wood and great vocal harmonies from Winwood and Capaldi, culminating in a strong track and centerpiece for the record. Phase 2 of Traffic was actually a much needed impetus for the gifted trio of players, that may have been a bit overshadowed by their former partner in Dave Mason from a few years past and emerge triumphant in their first full outing on vinyl with some marvelous results. 4 solid stars
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Wonderful distraction and visually mesmerizing. Love these type of visual physics apps. AND you can enjoy a few minutes of distraction in the grocery line with no warbling whistling sounds of annoyed flying critters!
B00006399Z|5.0|Recorded in the summer of '71, Welcome to the Canteen temporarily reunites Dave Mason with the core trio of Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood backed by the dynamic rhythm section of Rick Grech(Bass) and Jim Gordon(drums) culminating in a live set that is powerful, energetic and simply extraordinary. Culled from performances at Croydon's Fairfield Hall and a benefit concert in London for the Oz satirical publication(at the time, was under scruntiny for alleged obscenity under lawful grounds), although the record is a mere 6 tracks, the performances contained herein are hot and smoking and provide further evidence of the resurge in Traffic's reconstruction as a functional live entity. Opening with the groovin' rocker, Medicated Goo, Winwood and Capaldi harmonize brilliantly on this take and Mason provides some searing guitar work interlaid to build up the excitement of this killer song. Mason's \\"unplugged\\" Sad and Deep as You provides a moving and stirring number that has depth and power rendered with the percussion talents of Rebop Kwakuu Baah and Mason's tasteful acoustic guitar backed by the inimitable flute playing of Chris Wood.  40,000 Headmen continues the \\"unplugged\\" vibe here and is a faithful live rendition taken from the band's 2nd self-titled release, with a powerful vocal from Winwood. Shouldn't Have Took More than You Gave is another showcase for Dave Mason featuring his soulful vocal reading and exceptional wah-wah guitar arrangement, carried by Winwood's searing organ flourishes. The real meat of Canteen is justified by the album's closers, a dynamite and definitive version of Dear Mr. Fantasy(which features a guitar workout between Mason and Winwood) and a smoldering cover of Winwood's early Spencer Davis hit Gimme Some Lovin which boogies and rocks its way along quite compellingly. All told, Canteen is a brief, yet extraordinary moment in time, that is another piece of history signifying Traffic's importance within late 60's/early 70's bridgebetween pop/rock tendencies and adding a flair of true musical improvisation to the genre. Which is a certain quality that I feel Traffic had achieved within their inception and separated them from their contemporaries of the time period. Essential and Classic. 5 stars

B000002P2V|4.0|Although this album would prove to be Keith Moon's swan song with the band, Townshend's songwriting transcends from the previous Who By Numbers set and settles in more nicely as a matured and accomplished release. Lots of problems had been encountered once the band began recording this album in late Oct. of 1977, after an extended break taken by the band members, and it was Keith Moon whose time away had been proven most detrimental to his musicanship. Suffering from the excessive behaviors he had subjected to himself, in terms of alcohol use, coupled with an excessive weight gain, had done damage to Moon's health and ultimately his drumming capabilities. Townshend had begun experiencing gradual hearing loss, damaged due in part, to the agressively loud performances over a number of years and began to utilize special headsets in the studio to help aid his acute hearing handicap.  Famed engineer Glyn Johns, whom had been involved in the reconstruction of Who's Next and their last studio recording By Numbers, was selected to work with the band in the shaping of the record. Attempting a live feel would soon prove to be a disasterous exercise and after utilizing different studios and another engineer in Jon Astley, Who Are You remains a pieced together affair that suprisingly turns out rather nicely given the overlaborous care it required to get finished. New Song opens the record and right away, there is a sense of rejuvination and an update within the group's overall sound that is fresh and contemporary in its feel. Moon's drumming seems a bit toned down from albums past, and it is a bit sterile, at times, but also still provides the needed heartbeat and backbone to the ensemble. The use of synthesizers is very prominent on this release and also adds another texture of color and sound to enhance tracks like Sister Disco, Entwistle's 905 and of course, the album's title track.  Music Must Change utilizes footsteps which provide the desired percussion effect within thesongs quirky 6/8 time signature that Moon failed to successfully nail from previous takes. At times Daltrey's vocal delivery on this number is a little over the top esp. in the bridge of the track, but overall, exudes a thoroughly realized original Townshend number. Trick of the Light is another Entwistle original that is mid-paced and benefits from his heavily distorted 8 string Alembic bass that provides the main fused melody to this strong Who number, utilizing, again synthesizer flourishes to add texture and color. Guitar and Pen is perhaps, a bit outside of the box of typical Who songs and hints at the future sound of the band post-Moon on Face Dances, for example, which again is innovative for its time and adds a freshness that is most welcomed. Love is Coming Down is a ballad-type track that has a pleasant feel to it, but is also derivative and slightly generic in its subtleness. Sister Disco is a tuneful assault and a retort to the changing trends of pop music, in all its forms, and becomes another important track within the growth of the Who and their musical palette.  The title track, of course, is the most revered and popular song taken from this release and remains a legendary classic song which is quite labored in its arrangement and shows off Moon's reckless drumming style one more shining time. The remaster features two unreleased tracks sung by Townshend, the ballad-like No Road Romance and Empty Glass(later appearing on the future album of the same name) which features interesting bass lines from Entwistle and solid drumming from Moon; providing a neat demo take on this innovative and quirky tune. The last 3 bonus songs are different mixes of Guitar and Pen, Love is Comin Down and the \\"lost verse\\" version of Who Are You which also features further expletives that were partially disguised for commercial acceptance. In Closing, Who Are You is, in most respects, the last true Who release collectively, and unfortunately, the last to feature Moon the Loon. Their future releases with Kenny Jones were noble, in particular Face Dances, but Who Are You is really the final statement from the original lineup. 4 solid stars
B006E4QCXU|5.0|love the app I could play with it for hours.  Just watching all the designs it make depending on where you touch is great
B000002KOY|5.0|Sadly, Danny Whitten, whom was the main focus of Crazy Horse(previously The Rockets) died a couple of years after this stunning debut album and it serves as a testament as to why Neil Young had chosen the core of the Horse(Billy Talbot-Bass, Whitten-Guitar/vocals and Ralph Molina-Drums) to be his permanent backing group when he wasn't being preoccupied with the parallel of performing with Crosby, Stills & Nash. Accompanied by ace musician/arranger Jack Nitzsche and a very young Nils Lofgren, Crazy Horse is a lost gem within early 70's California rock and roll. Opening with Gone Dead Train(written by Jack and Russ Titelman) the sound is of Topanga Canyon with a touch of country thrown in for good measure and Whitten's vocals are typically of a high-lonesome cracked twange in his delivery. Neil's presence is evident on the writing credits of two numbers: Dance, Dance, Dance, which continues the country-rock vibe replete with a fiddle by Gib Gilbeau; and co-written with Whitten, Downtown that has a leaning rock/pop vibe about it and would feature again in live form on Young's Tonight's the Night album done in tribute to Whitten.  Nils Lofgren contributes 2 tracks in the forms of the Stones-esque Beggars Day, that has a subtle, yet, growing quality in its chord progression and darker melody tone, while Nobody is a tight shuffle that contains a similar approach in its arrangement, albeit more upbeat in the chorus, while the verse lays back. Nevertheless, Whitten and Lofgren work wonderfully together on these fine Lofgren originals and it further adds more balance to the record. Whitten's Look at All the Things is ballad-like and shows the vulnerability, but power in Whitten's singing, while Dirty, Dirty is a simple R&B blues workout and it jams pretty dirty, indeed! I Don't Want to Talk About It would later find success from Rod Stewart's version, but the original take here is simple, sparse and heartachingly beautiful; truly a real glimpse of Whitten's talents. I'll GetBy is a lazy, yet upbeat track that features fine, fine vocal harmonies and a carefree, healing feel musically. Carolay is another gem worth of mention as far as vocals, ensemble and performance goes; written again by Russ Titelman and Jack Nitzsche, this track is one of my favorite numbers on this set and should've been a single if it wasn't chosen already.  The album closes with a Nitzsche tune, Crow Jane Lady, sung by Jack and features Ry Cooder on slide guitar, most prominently; Ry had also guested on I Don't Want To Talk About It and Dirty, Dirty as well giving a little bit of a boost in the guitar dept. as Whitten's heroin abuse had affected the sessions. Despite this, Crazy Horse's debut remains the band's best recording out of its scattered output over the years and has stood the test of time. Highly Recommended to fans of early 70's California Rock. 5 BIG Stars....

B000001FV1|4.0|Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory remains a consistent follow up to the classic Low Spark of Hi-Heeled Boys set, previously. The trio of Winwood, Capaldi and Wood is backed by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section of David Hood on Bass and Roger Hawkins on Drums, while still retaining Rebop on percussion, culminating in a release that doesn't quite match the greatness of Low Spark, yet all the more within the slim 5 track selection, creates a release that, somewhat, shadows the former outing. The title track starts things off right with a driving rhythm and is propelled by Winwood's guitar/organ melodies backed with the powerful sax of Chris Wood. Roll Right Stones is a bit labored in certain aspects, but overall still retains a consistent and solid feel for the space of the remaining record. Evening Blue is a quieter number and exposes the delicate, yet powerful vocals of Winwood most significantly, backed by an introductive sparse acoustic guitar melody that grows into a strong and contemplative number which has beautiful charms interlaid with the sax of Chris Wood.  Tragic Magic is an instrumental featuring Chris Wood and Steve's guitar most prominently and would provide a space in the live shows for the band to expand on their improvisational qualities, with often marvelous results. Sometimes I Feel So Uninspired is a bit melancholy, but all the more brave and powerful in its interpretation and also provided a chance for Winwood, once again, to show off his virtuosities, zeroing in on his strong guitar playing most importantly. While not captilizing fully on the solidness of the previous Low Spark set, Shoot Out is still a consistently essential record to have within the best of the Traffic discography. 4 stars

The performances are all quite strong, including the brief bookends provided by Derek Jacobi.
0375826726|2.0|I do not recall the exact number of times when I was about to throw this book out of the window, but it was well in the 2 digit range. Nevertheless, I always came back to it, reading the next chapter - never loosing the hope that this time anything of interest would happen. It never did. But it was not so much the lack of interesting events that brought my blood pressure to dangerously high levels - more was it Eragon´s constant whining about his role as the last free rider, about being separated from Saphira, about being ignored by Arya and soooooo many other things. This constant childish behavior and whining got me to the point where I was fantasizing about hitting him in the face just to shut him up.  And even though I was trying not to: I already bought book number 4 and I know I am going to read it. Let´s hope that Eragon finally mans up!!!
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|I really did enjoyed David Fincher's remake, but some of the key emotionally unnerving scenes like Lisbeth's interview with her new guidance counselor, the rape scene later on, and when Henrik finally finds out what happened to Harriet were just not as intense as they were in the Swedish version, in my honest opinion. I won't go into anymore detail than that because i don't want to ruin the movie for some people, so i'll simply say it was a decent remake and i can't wait for the other two movies to come out in theaters, but at this moment i feel that the Swedish verson of the first film is superior. 3.5 stars
B0073PZIYI|1.0|The only reason people would want to watch this movie is because of Justin Timberlake. The guy should have read the script instead of just saying, \\"I can play the part\\". Good movies are more than a different plot, there are so many scenes which do not make sense at all; for example Justin is running full out and a women wearing 5\\" heels is keeping-up abreast of him. The dumb dialog comes next, he turns to her and says, \\"boy you can really run fast!\\" The whole movie was filled with scenes like this! I had to watch the movie in 4 parts cause I could not sit long enough for this kind of stupidity.

076115678X|5.0|I have owned the orginal \\"Curly Girl\\" handbook for nine years, but it has come apart at the seams, so I bought this updated version. This is a much-improved 'part 2' to the original book. Here, we get more advice and improved methods of taking care of curls and waves. It includes updates with a few of the women from the original book as well as the stories of new women and even a couple of men. There's are also new chapters about the dangers of thermal reconditioning and women who came out of chemotherapy with curly hair growing in. It even includes a DVD that demonstrates how to take care of curls. My one minor complaint about this book is that while there are more options as to what kind of curls exist, I still do not fall into any one catagory. I would say that I am a Corkscrew curly, but my hair doesn't have its 'symptoms' (I can't use things like hot oil or cream gel because it sits on my hair and makes it stringy). Then there's the new Corkicelli curl, whose symptoms I seem to have, but my hair doesn't look anything like. I just follow the procedure for Botticelli hair, even though it is probably not my hair type. Also, I have to admit that I am intimidated by the idea of having to cut my own hair because of the ignorance of most salons; every salon I've ever gone to brushes my hair, shampoos it and cuts it wet (the wrong way). Still, I know that the authors are right because of how great my hair looks now that I know what to do with it. I gave the original book four stars; I'll give this one a perfect five.

B003X73QA8|5.0|I bought this album right when it came out and haven't ever gotten tired of it. I just checked my iTunes stats and I've listened to each song at least 15 times (some over 25). Once you listen to a record that many times, they might as well be paying YOU. Also, if you get the chance, go see Arcade Fire live. I caught them at Starlight in KC and was blown away.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|I hoped for more. For fluid creative fun, I recommend Fleya on the Android Marketplace. It makes beautiful, colorful designs that you can save. Fleya: 5 stars. Gravilux: 2.5 stars, 5 minutes of play Including settings, uninstalled it already.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I purchased this digital copy along with my DVD, but had I known what Flixster was all about I would not have. I wanted a digital copy I could download to my ipad and my ipod. So Flixster sent me a digital copy, but when I tried to download it through itunes it would not work. So I contacting Flixster again. Again they sent me another digital copy. And when I tried to download again through itunes, again it did not work. I brought this movie back on December 9 and here it is February 1 and still I do not have a digital copy. I am so fed up with this. I will just go buy a digital copy somewhere other than Flixster for sure from now on. This is the first time a have written a review on anything. I am just so furstrated with this. It is not complicated to send a digital copy that works. I have downloaded digital copies before and since. I just do not understand why I can not seem to get a working digital copy from Flixster. The movie was good and very funny.

0439023521|5.0|Before I even start to review this book, I will admit to you all that \\"The Hunger Games\\" is not the type of book that I would normally read.  The dust jacket did not even appeal to me at all, so why in the world would I, not only read The Hunger Games, but also the following two sequels?  The answer is simple....... The books are that good!!!  I discovered this trilogy of  books thru word of mouth.  They were recommended to me by a few fellow knitters, whom couldn't seem to put them down, even to knit. I looked at them occasionally, read some reviews and finally, after pondering on them for a few months,  took the plunge and bought all three.  I then found myself jumping into the world of The Hunger Games  \\"Whole Hog\\" as we say here in the south.  Book begins with describing the world that Katniss Everdeen and her family are forced to live in, by the capital of Panem and President Snow.  The story revolves around \\" The Games\\" held once a year, as the players fight for their very lives.  From all of the players, only one person can walk from the arena, alive and be proclaimed as \\"The Victor\\".  As the  story unfolds you will experience love, hate, hope, betrayal, loyalty and revenge.  You will see the struggle for survival and compassion for the dying.  I will warn you, this book will cause you to think.  What would you do , if you were thrown into the same arena, in the same situation and had to fight for your life.  This is a great book for the young, as well as old.  Everyone can take something away from The Hunger Games.  The only real disappointment I had with the first two books, were the abrupt ending.  If you don't buy the sequels, you will be left hanging.  The Closure will only come at the end of the third book Mockingjay.  I will read these three books again, in the future.  All three are a wonderful addition to my personal library.  I look forward to reading all three books again with my neice, when she is old enough to understand and enjoy them.  I also feel as they would make a great Book Club read with an in dept discussion on each book.  I highly recomend \\"The Hunger Games\\" book 1,  \\"Catching Fire\\" book 2 and \\"Mockingjay\\" book 3 by Suzanne Collins.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|It exists in some kind of alternate universe that's a mishmash of now and the 80s. Drive (2011) has a lusciously compelling pull to it--a sort of poetically violent dream set against Los Angeles, which never ceases to be a place of intrigue on the screen. Ryan Gosling plays a stunt man who makes money on the side as a getaway driver. He gets involved with his neighbor and then, when her husband is released from prison, agrees to help him get some mobsters off his back by knocking off a pawn shop.  Check out the full article at The Panned Review.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Most folk reading this probably read the graphic novels and watched the first season as it was aired on A&E and then bought the DVD/BD when it became available. I know that was how I experienced the show. When this re-release was announced, I actually found myself looking forward to the Special Edition.<br /><br />The reasoning is simple - every episode had at least one commentary track (Pilot Ep has two in fact). A whole slew of featurettes, and the original pilot... shot in unrelenting black & white. I've gone through most of the special features and have greatly enjoyed the commentary, specifically director Frank Darabont's musings through the Pilot. He describes the series as an event that allowed him to do the sort of film he'd always wanted to.<br /><br />Yes, from the man who did Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile. But we know his involvement simply meant that folk would take this project seriously, and as it should be. You can't sell a survival horror story without the deep humanizing that we see in this much too short of it's first season.<br /><br />One note: commentary tracks may 'dare' you to point out an f/x shot that was done practically or digitally; apparently they think these effects are done so well, you can't tell. Well, for that I have only one thing to say...<br /><br />CGI is very clear on a big 47\\" screen and PS3 BD.<br /><br />Now, it is amazing that they now reveal their is a lot more CGI in these introductory shots. The military base outside the hospital... whole thing: CGI, except for a heli shell, but even it's blades were CGI.<br /><br />I've written this review specifically to give you as possible buyers what you are getting into.

0812992792|5.0|Totalitarian regimes owe their success (as long as it lasts) to an ability to simultaneously terrorize and mislead their citizenry. The classic works demonstrating this principle have been [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]], [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]], and [[ASIN:0451228146 One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the resulting demise of the Cold War have left only a few Stalinist states.Many of the so-called Communist countries today have thriving and open free-market economies to which the one-party rule of those states actually promotes capitalist ideals.<br /><br />The biggest exception to this trend is North Korea, where The Orphan Master's Son is set. We are thrust into a paranoid nation which fears \\"sneak attacks\\" by Americans, Japanese and homosexual men. It is a world where family members disappear, only to be replaced by strangers. It is a world where orphans are given the names of North Korean martyrs, a stigma which makes them readily identifiable for the worst jobs. Our protagonist is supposed to be the son of the Orphan Master, which confers a degree of legitimacy but for his martyr's name. Is he or is he not an orphan? In fact, under such circumstances, who is he at all? He is assigned orphans work in the army, the job of being what we used to call a tunnel-rat, who lived and fought in the darkness and whose compatriots would burrow under Seoul and climb ladders to walk freely in capitalist Korea only to retreat down below and return to darkness. We is assigned a job as an intelligence radioman on a fishing boat, scanning the airways for news from the South Koreans, Japanese and Americans. He travels to Texas, of all places, where he assumes another identity that of an Olympic taekwondo gold medalist. Soon enough he becomes a replacement for that man even taking his wife, the lovely actress Sun Moon as her replacement husband.<br /><br />It is a world where even doves and trees become heroes of the statefor extraordinary bravery during sneak attacks as they protected the Great Leader (Kim Il Sung) from harm. It is also a world where loyalty to the Dear Leader (Kim Il Jong) will get you everything or nothing at all, depending on his mood. The totalitarian state is filled with \\"crows\\" deadly transport vehicles who take their human cargo to prison mines or even worse lobotomy prison mines. We find dogs, not in the streets of the capitol, but in the Central Zoo there so the citizens can see these capitalist pets for themselves. Such a society must have interrogators and interrogators must have some form of family unless of course they are orphans. The central interrogator is a proud graduate of Kim Il Sung University and takes down the life story of each prisoner before consigning them to a final passage with a machine called the Auto-pilot. Other interrogators are less \\"scientific\\" and use torture to gain information before the prisoner expires. Notably even the blind parents of the scientific interrogator fear him and endlessly recite propaganda slogans praising the Dear Leader as he lovingly tends to them.<br /><br />This is a special book, and one which will be smuggled like bibles into that sad land. There citizens will read it at peril of their lives. Free people should read it as well.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|Pour ces concertos enregistrés il y a plus de vingt ans, je craignais le pire concernant la qualité acoustique. En effet, dans ces premières années des enregistrements tout-numérique (DDD), les appareils enregistreurs-codeurs digitaux étaient généralement de piètre qualité en tout cas comparativement aux appareils purement analogiques, et les résultats acoustiques, hélas, bien souvent tristes! Mais ici il n'en est rien; on peut même parler de prouesse: balance, clarté et dynamique sont impeccables! Mais ce qui réjouit le coeur au plus haut point c'est la musicalité de Melle Uchida; elle sait tout exprimer avec un naturel troublant (drame, tristesse, joie, gravité...). Du très grand art! Un parcours sans faute pour la meilleure intégrale des concertos de Mozart de ces trente dernières années. Un coffret hautement recommandable.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I had a program like this on my iPad,  but never expected to get this on a phone.  wow! Awesome for writing quick notes.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Living in the Midwest this app has really come in handy.  I especially like the extended forecast.  Most importantly, it is pretty accurate.  Would definitely recommend it to my friends.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the choice of reading plans and the ability to choose from many translations. I also enjoy being able to highlight and save notes to look back on later.

B006E4QCXU|5.0|And I can say it in one word...AWESOME!!!  Thank you, Scott Snibbe Studio, for submitting this; and thank you Amazon for making this a FAotD (although I would happily shell out $1.99 for this app (yes, it's that good)).
B004ZNB12O|5.0|I can understand how this collection might be a travesty to big time Pink Floyd fans.  Their albums surely have their own atmospheres, concepts, flows, whatever that get damaged by ripping them from their \\"homes\\" and sticking them on a compilation.  But lookit, and I don't mean this like it might sound, but some of us who really enjoy Pink Floyd once they get going (by which I mean - whenever the songs actually go ahead and hit their lyrical and melodic strides) just don't like it (you can say we don't \\"get it\\" if you like; hey, maybe we don't) when the cosmic weirdo warm-up sounds delay the meat of the music for five forevers.  It doesn't mean the band doesn't have anything to offer us, or even that what it offers us isn't pretty deep.  If you're a sensitive, haunted type, then \\"When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse out of the corner of my eye.  I turned around and it was gone.  I cannot put my finger on it now ...\\" can resonate deeply with you, can move you, can do that big thing to you that music does.  Even if you don't want to hear R2D2 on LSD make love to himself for five minutes before anything gets said.  And if you're that guy (or girl, but let's face it, guy more likely), this is the collection you've been waiting for.  These songs are hits, yeah, but hits become hits because they're accessible.  And some things that are widely accessible are lame.  But many are not.  These songs are not.  They're really good.  And they get right to it.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|I saw this in the movies and it was terrible! its just not worth it! just dont buy it! It really is bad. the story is stupid. 1st movie was better! Im very dissapointed...

B000002TPS|5.0|As someone who has only recently gotten into Megadeth, this one beginning to end is a stand out. I have worked my way through the entire catalog, and no this is not Killing or Peace Sells, but it still stands out just the same.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|gimme every game ya got they're awesome! so far this one is the best tho! kind dumb there's a word minimum don't ya think?  Uhh, yeah!
0061969656|2.0|I am a big Uhtred fan and have avidly raced to the bookstore (Amazon, natch) whenever a new installment comes out, but this latest book left me feeling like I was floundering in the Thames without an oar or a paddle! The author has gotten formulaic and predictable with these Saxon stories and I feel as if Cornwell has gotten bored with his own subject matter. I hope that he goes back and re-reads the first couple of books in the Saxon Tales and rekindles his passion for the story of Uhtred; I don't want Uhtred the Wicked to turn into a Uhterd the forgettable.
B004LUS390|1.0|I had just recently bought the app for Kindle Fire then 3 days later it was not compatible for Kindle Fire. I wasted my money on stylus' for this app that doesn't work. What happened

B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I am not into the country music today. It is boring and sound alike but if there were more bands and singers like this band then I would buy like them up.  Best songs and cd to come out in years. Looking forward to their next cd.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It has most translations, the ability to download several for when you're offline, save notes, plus multiple reading plans!  Get it, use it.  Have the Word of God wherever you go!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Make room among your holiday purchases for some new Christmas music, and put Michael Buble at the top of your list. Most pop music fans will not be disappointed regardless of their favorite genre of music. For those familiar with Michael Buble and long-term fans, this is the type of Christmas collection you would expect with a few surprises tucked in. If you have not yet discovered him, or turned away from his delivery of pop standards, this is an album to check out.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This product was the perfect choice to protect the Kindle Fire.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting an easy way to protect their device.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|The Social Network has received rave reviews, and has been hailed as one of the best films of 2010. Certainly it's one of the first great movies to be made about the internet era.  I was pleasantly surprised by the amount that I enjoyed this film. To be honest, I was skeptical about the acting value involved in this film, but once I watched it, I had to watch it again (it was that good). Highly recommended.
145162445X|5.0|Lawrence Krauss has done everyone a great service by writing this book. Krauss, in \\"A Universe from Nothing,\\" explains our current picture of the cosmos: where it came from and where it is going. Although he covers a lot of ground, the book is fairly simple to read, though if you haven't read anything on cosmology, this book may be a bit daunting. If this is your first book on cosmology/physics, I'd recommend reading [[ASIN:0375708111 The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory]] first, so you can get an idea for the general concepts.  My favorite section of the book is when Krauss explains the existence of virtual particles. Virtual particles, which are particles that don't actually exist, contribute energy, and therefore mass, to particles. The mass comes about from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. There are two equations, but the one that we are interested in says any uncertainty regarding the amount of energy possessed by a particle and time (of duration) of that possession has to be equal or greater than Planck's Constant (h/2*pi). Shorter the time of possession is more energy these particles can possess and don't forget that according to Einstein (E=mc^2) energy is also mass. Krauss then extends this to empty space itself, which means empty space can have mass, and via general relativity, contribute a negative energy to space, causing it to expand (and explanation for dark energy?).  Some people have said that Krauss is \\"arrogant,\\" claiming that he has \\"all the answers.\\" This is far from the truth. As is apparent throughout the book, Krauss lets the reader know when things are speculations or uncertain. That's what made this a great read: even though we know a lot about the universe, there are many things we don't know, and that's something beautiful. It gives us something to ponder and search for the answers.  One thing that could be improved is possibly explaining the concepts a bit more (as described above) and including the actual equations so we can get a feel of what's going on. Even though Krauss says what the equations are, he writes them out, which could be hard to keep track of if you don't write it down.  For anyone interested in what we currently know about the cosmos, and what we do not, I highly recommend Krauss' book.

Well built, i didnt know if i would like it that much , but when it dropped in price i picked it up and so far so good, it fits my hand perfect. you can acually go check out the youtube videos on it..
B006E4QCXU|5.0|great but where is the gravity/antigravity function on the kindle fire? I can't find it I only can toggle colors.
0812979702|5.0|This is my second reading of Tim Gallwey's Inner Game of Golf. Been a fan since my tennis days when his Inner Game of Tennis was like my bible which I shared, and shared, and shared with friends who never seemed to return the book.  Actually played a round with Tim one day without realizing who he was until the back nine.  He practices what he preaches.  Am practicing what he preaches and I've got better ball contact and distance as a result.  I'm a 67 year old woman who plays once a week (still in a 9-5 job) and can't hit it as far as I'd like, so I'm applying his technique (for lack of a better word) for accuracy and to my short game.  It works for putting for me too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|simple and User friendly interface ...makes Bible reading so much more fun.  I love d Bible versions and also the daily plans. awesome
B0031R5K8G|4.0|A quirky, bitter-sweet tale told from the perspective of an autistic teen. A very clever composition, written in a deceptively simple style. It helps to demystify some of the unusual behavior of a person with autism. The main character, Christopher, is likeable and unintentionally funny, but what really appealed to me was his childlike, guileless honesty, and his observations on behavior and life. A short easy read of worth.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I looked at it at first, and thought &quot;meh&quot;. Then I looked over at my cat sleeping beside me and got an idea. Downloaded the app, set it beside her, and showed her how it moved. Hilarity ensued. So please, when you see this app, think of the kittehs!
0316098329|4.0|Room was something else. Although its technically for the adult audience, Its so unique that I cant help but review it. Overall the idea of people who are kidnapped, isn't that uncommon, what really put Room out there, is that the whole book is from Jack, who has lived in Room his whole life, and honest to god thinks that there is no one in the world other then his mom, himself, and Old Nick, their captor. Even though his mother tries to explain that what you see in TV is real, that there are people and grass, and animals, its almost impossible for jack to wrap his head around. Like if for example, you were trying to explain what colors look like to someone who was born blind. However, even though its impossible for jack to contemplate how huge the world really is, he seems to be an accelerated learner, his vocabulary is much higher then your average 5 year old's. (probably from all the tv ) and he's much more perceptive then you would expect.  I wonder what Donoghue had to do to get into Jacks mind, It really is quite extraordinary...  The Books split up into multiple parts, from Jack first learning that hes actually locked up, to the escape. and yes -SPOILER- they do find a way to escape. (but that's predictable) Almost more interesting was how jack reacted in the environments outside of room. He has depth perception problems, and an innocence that you wouldn't expect from a child in that situation.  anyways I think its a definite yes, recommendation wise. There's something in it for everyone, and its the type of book that's not easy to forget.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Wow I feel so calm! I was stressed all day but now I feel like I am soaring. I feel as if I am floating in a giant bubble.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Now that I have the kindle fire hd I can connect this app to the tv through the hdmi port. This has a whole new level of soothing power on the big screen.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Like everyone else has said, it's simple but addictive, especially if you're the ADD type that can stare at random blinking Xmas lights for hours. Also, if you have a rooted phone, you could make this a wallpaper or live wallpaper using a screenshot app or the screen recorder app that's out there.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a simple but cool app on my HTC Incredible. Just wish I had a tablet to play with it on!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Great looking app, although only interesting for a few seconds... Would make an amazing live wallpaper though. Would have been disappointed if it wasn't faotd.
0439023521|5.0|You're probably wondering why I rated this book five stars given the title of my review.  Well, this first book in the Hunger Games Trilogy definitely deserves such a high rating, but I think readers should be warned about how the story progresses in the other two installments.  I found the first book to be truly an engaging and riveting read about Katniss Everdeen, one of twenty-four contestants fighting to the death in a politically-motivated and televised event orchestrated by the Capitol. The Capitol is seen as the ruler that forces a boy and a girl from twelve districts to participate in the Hunger Games each year to remind the people in the districts that they are at the Capitol's mercy.  Suzanne Collins delivers such an intense emotional experience that even when I took breaks from reading, I found myself thinking about the characters, the story, and even my own life.  The Hunger Games is not a sappy teenage novel in any stretch of the imagination-it is so much more, too complicated to sum up in this small review.  Katniss' action at the end of the first installment triggers a rebellion against the Capitol, which left me with a sense of hope that the district people would finally be able to fight against all the injustices brought on by the Capitol and succeed, but I was wrong. No one ever truly succeeds.  After the rebellion ensues, a war is triggered. The second book deals with the rebellion, the third with the war.  If you think the first installment carried with it a dark and depressing tone, well, you haven't even experienced the tip of the iceberg.  Almost all characters you grow to love meet horrible deaths. Katniss' family and friends aren't spared either. They are tortured and killed in agonizing detail. The strong heroine you meet in the opening chapters of The Hunger Games wittles away into a tormented soul, plagued by nightmares and haunting images of her friends and family. Her memories destroy her, and leave her a hollow shell.  She even loses her best friend; the horrors of the war, not death, driving them apart. This was so sad and gut-wrenching to me. Many readers argue that Collins betrays the true nature of this character for the sake of the ending, and I agree.  I loved the first half of Catching Fire, the second installment, as much as the first book until Katniss and Peeta are forced to endure another round of the games. This part signaled to me that there would be more darkness ahead rather than light.  Then, in the third installment, Mockingay, everything finally unravels and falls apart completely. The reader is left with no sense of hope, and it left me depressed. To be honest, I read a little over a third of Mockingjay before I decided that I wouldn't force myself to continue such a dreadful story. I skipped to the Epilogue just to get some closure, but there was none to be had.  Part of me wishes I would have never picked up this Trilogy, another part of me wishes I would have stopped after the first book and remembered the characters the way they were. Strong and full of hope.
B0034G4P80|2.0|Decided to try to fill in my library of DVD's by ordering Used - Good and Used - Like New DVD's offered on Amazon.  Received my copy of Thor Today - Used / Like New.  The DVD Case had friction scratches on the front more than DVD's that i have owned for years, certainly not Like New.  Other DVD's that I received classifed as Used / Good that were fulfilled by Amazon where shrink wrapped, with Product Labels applied to the shrink wrap. Thor was not shrink wrapped and had the product label stuck firmly on the exterior of the DVD Case.  If DVD plays, I will keep it and replace the case, but if not I will return it.  So Far, kind of disappointed :-(  [[ASIN:B0034G4P80 Thor]]
