0307454541|5.0|This is an excellent book if you're looking for an adventure.  It is a well written novel with interesting characters, particularly the protaganist, Ms. Salander.  I chose this  book because I wanted to be entertained, and I found myself delighted by the intensity of the story, on the edge of my chair and unable to sleep until the book was finished.  I followed-up with the second book in the series, and I so far I am equallly delighted.
0440245931|4.0|Definitely a page turner, keeps you hooked for most of the book. There are some boring parts where Grisham gets to \\"legal\\", but its these parts that makes the story real. I'd recommend this book to anyone, its worth the 9 dollars you spend.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|This is a horrible dumbing down of a great BBC doc series. If you compare this DISCOVERY channel version with the excellent BBC version, you will notice that most all the science and particularly mentions of evolution have been removed. That's what's really going on here. A producer friend told me that shows are no longer allowed to use the words EVOLUTION or EVOLVED on Discovery Channel or Discovery Science Channel. That's the main thing that is really going on here with the Discovery re-scripting of this originally 5 star program, that reduces it to negative star status. I wish I could give it less than one star.
B000J10KTQ|4.0|What I like about this Superman is he captures that awkward brilliance that was Christopher Reeves - even kinda looks like him!<br />But whereas the movie starts strong and makes us feel very exhilarated, the latter half of the movie falls flat.<br />Gene Hackman played a Lex Luthor that you would despise yet also laugh off and laugh at. He wasn't a nemesis that you would fear, like the new Batman's Heath Ledger's Joker. In the first Christopher Reeve's Superman, it was all about Superman, and Reeves carried the whole film. For some reason, I didn't feel Brandon Routh's Superman carried the film, and worse yet, I didn't feel Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor had that Hackman magnetism.<br />I guess in the end, although this is the \\"New,\\" it's just not the same - it doesn't carry the same magic feeling.<br />Hopefully the next one will delve deeper into the character, but just not on the superficial level.<br />To me, the most \\"human\\" film of all the superhero movies is the Spiderman trilogy, and I think since Superman can be a really deep character to explore into, hopefully it will develop into more of that direction, than the usual Hollywood blockbuster movie devoid of any real story and character development.<br />I enjoyed it, but it's not on the same level as the new Spiderman and Batman (even the new Edward Norton's Hulk has better character development).

B001CD6FKI|1.0|Speed Racer (The Wachowski Brothers, 2008)<br /><br />\\"The first symptom of motion picture sickness:\\" Noah Eli Gordon cautions us in Novel Pictorial Noise (q.v.), \\"being content to stare at whatever's there.\\" Could there possibly be a more appropriate place to drop that epigram than in a review of yet another bloated, unnecessary piece of crap from the Wachowski Brothers? Yes, I do realize the irony. And yet I knew I would eventually have to watch this flick, if only because like many people in their early forties, I was a complete Speed Racer addict back when it was in syndication. (Yeah, I tried the new \\"reboot\\" TV series a few years back. I lasted about three episodes.) And really, it's not a bad cast, as long as you discount the always-awful Susan Sarandon. And there are a whole lot of people (I am not among them) who thought the first and second Wachowski Brothers flicks were actually really good. (I thought Bound was one of the most boring attempts at noir I'd ever seen, and The Matrix was... just plain awful, really.) So while it was the slimmest of slivers, I had some minor hope in my heart that the Bros Wachowski would find it in their hearts not to completely mess up one of my most beloved childhood memories. More fool me.<br /><br />The thing is, I really do see what it was they were intending to do with all that awful CGI. It's obvious the intent was to make it look as much like the cartoon as possible without delving into actual cels. And in some ways, I admire the attempt. It's a good idea, and maybe someone will eventually get it right. But everything else about this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong.<br /><br />This movie does have a plot, though you have to stay awake long enough for it to get to its point. The Racer family--Speed (played as an adult by Milk's Emile Hirsch, and as a child by White Noise's Nicholas Elia), Pops (John Goodman), Mom (Sarandon), and Spritel (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's Paulie Litt, who steals every scene he's in), along with perennial hangers-on Trixie (Christina Ricci, and how nice it is to see her back on the big screen), Sparky (Garage Days' Kick Gurry) and Jim-Jim (played by a pair of chimps), are keeping their independence in a sea of corruption and sponsorship (which are always the same thing) in the racing game. (As with the original series, the main basis for the racing seems to be Formula 1, but digressions are made into other forms for plot purposes.) When Speed turns down a lucrative offer from Royalton (The Queen's Roger Allam), the head of Royalton Racing, Royalton's team goes after him. Meanwhile, Speed gets involved in trying to ferret out racing's criminal elements with the mysterious Racer X (Lost's Matthew Fox) and Taejo (Korean pop superstar Rain). Speed suspects Racer X of being his supposedly-dead brother Rex (Dear John's Scott Porter, in flashback)... well, if I kept going, we'd be here all day. If you've ever seen the original series, you know most of it anyway. (Also, if you know the original series, you'll notice some minor spelling corrections in the names.)<br /><br />And that's one of the big problems: the Wachowskis tried to cram at least half the plot points from the series' original run (52 episodes, in case anyone wasn't counting) into a two-and-a-quarter-hour movie, with the expected results. There's way too much going on here, and I'm sure if you aren't familiar with the series, it's terribly confusing. Hell, it was confusing to me, and I am familiar with the original series. As well, and this was the kicker to me, Speed's character is entirely changed. I know you can't have two-dimensional good guys and bad guys in an action movie anymore, and I have criticized any number of films for not shading their characters better. But Speed Racer himself here isn't shaded; he comes off as much of a thug behind the wheel as his enemies, and that is more depressing than anything else in this movie. There are no good guys, unless you're willing to toe the \\"indie by any means necessary\\" line far closer than I ever was. (And I didn't read too many reviews of the movie, but didn't anyone else notice the irony of the \\"indie or die\\" theme being played so strongly in a film with a one hundred twenty million dollar budget that opened on five thousand screens worldwide?)<br /><br />But I do have to give credit where credit is due, and credit is due to both Christina Ricci, a very good actress who has been perennially underutilized by Hollywood, and Paulie Litt. Both of them make the movie worth watching; they're the only things that do. This is an awful, awful film, and both of them do the best they can, but they're wasted on this material. Rumor has it that Alfonso Cuaron was originally attached to this movie. Would that he had directed it. ½\\" line far closer than I ever was.

B000021XR5|5.0|Lots of great music on this recording and much of the music is very lyrical and very lovely, not what you'd expect from a grunge-metal band. The melodies and harmonies and really good and it is very clear that the musicians know what they are doing. Songs like Sour Girl and Atlanta are very lovely -- this is a very rewarding recording.
B001SN78JO|4.0|Generally speaking, I run (screaming) from Jim Carrey movies.  This dude wore out his welcome back when Nirvana was cranking out hits.  Yet Jim's lone salvation in the comedy YES MAN is delectable and cuddly cute Zooey Deschanel; playing a free spirit romantic interest Zooey is a wonderful counter to Carrey's overplayed antics.  Which makes YES MAN an enjoyable experience, as a shallow loan officer who constantly says \\"No\\" to lenders has his life transformed via a rowdy seminar (like that plot's never been done before) and commits to saying \\"Yes\\" to everything he's asked.  Meanwhile he enters into a romance with very predictable results.<br /><br />While Carrey often gets chalkboard-scraping annoying, he does exhibit (on occasion) a delightful rustic charm.  For example, his guitar serenade to prevent a disturbed Luis Guzman from jumping off a ledge is the film's best feel-good moment.  There are similar little gems interspersed throughout the movie (an encounter with an elderly lonely neighbor being one of them) to offset Carrey's perpetual mayhem.  There's a sizable supporting cast (with only Terrence Stamp and Guzman standing out from the crowd) and the story is so predictable you can set your watch to it, yet YES MAN is fun because Zooey is so cute you forget Carrey's around.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
0143036424|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, even though it used the \\"f\\" word more times than I cared to hear (I actually listened to the unabridged audio).  The reader was superb and the story was excellent. It's not often a book moves me to tears but I was so involved with the characters it was hard not to become emotionally involved.  When the book ended, I wanted more! It's been a long time since I've read a book this good. Kudos to the author for letting us get to know all the characters well and involving them all in the mystery. Quite the talent. I highly recommend this book.
B003K025V4|5.0|I bought this cd hoping it wouldn't be one of those good girls gone bad type cds that became total trash. While a couple songs were dissappointing such as Robot with its crazy break away from the machine message, it is still fun to workout to.    Once I listened to this cd it was easy to see that I love it! It is a fun cd to workout to or just hangout and listen to.  The songs have deep meanings that I find very relatable to life. I love how she has such an influence in her own music. There are great ballads on this cd as well as energetic tunes that will get you moving.  I really love the song \\"Two More Lonely People.\\"  You may not like the clothing choices that Miley makes, but her music is amazing and this cd proves that.  It was everything I hoped it would be. It definitely didn't dissappoint.  I listen to every song on this cd and enjoy it. DEFINITELY worth the money.
B002ZG994U|5.0|This movie cracked me up.  I am definetly buying this movie when it comes out on DVD.  I also plan to watch it a few times.<br /><br />I liked the characters, the actors who protrayed the characters, the action, the jokes, the interaction between the characters.  This is an action, kick-butt movie and it delivers.  If you are looking for something intellectual and for it to be realistic, may I remind you that it is a movie.  Entertainment.  Something to laught at, say \\"ohhhhh\\" and just enjoy.<br /><br />Critcs suck.  I mean really SUCK.  How can someone else critic a movie for a world with such diverse interests, likes and dislikes.  YOU CAN'T.  You can't read a book, watch a movie and determine whether it's a good or bad for the next person.  That should not be a paying job.<br /><br />Go watch the movie and if you like action movies with plenty of blow it up, shoot it up and just make somebody have a bad day movie.  This movie is for you.<br /><br />I also liked the last Rambo (that's the best one to me), From Paris With Love and The Chipmunks 1 & 2.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|My husband & I watch this movie on a monthly basis.  It's our favorite escape movie!  We love the music, scenery & story.  It makes us want to move to a villa & grow our own vines.  We settle for watching the movie again along with a glass of wine.
0307454541|5.0|I'm not usually a big fan of mystery novels, but a friend suggested this book to me and I'm so glad he did. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" has it all: intrigue, deception, crime, family secrets, and suspense. The characters of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are extremely dynamic, and I cannot wait to continue along with their journey in the other two books in this trilogy. I do admit that the first 100 pages or so of this book were a bit slow going, as were the last 70 pages. However, the rest of the book is so fast-paced and energized that it more than makes up for the couple of slow spots. Definitely add this book to your summer reading list!

0385523386|3.0|I got interested in reading Orange is the New Black after reading an excerpt in the New York Times, and reading an article from Piper's fiance Larry in the Times as well.  I just finished it, and I found it really interesting - the details she provides on life in prison, the rituals, the jobs, the treatment of prisoners, is really fascinating and a view on a minimum security prison I'd never seen before. But I was often frustrated with Kerman's lack of details - I had no sense of how it was that she was free to just go do yoga or run around the track whenever she wanted, or what kind of hours she worked at her electric and construction jobs.  I was really moved by the descriptions of the other women in prison and of the friendships she formed, but I also had trouble keeping the women straight, especially when she'd bring up a name that she hadn't mentioned in several chapters, and I would try to remember who Delicious or Pom-Pom or Toni was.     I did find her to be a bit smug, going out of her way to explain that while most prisoners kept to their ethnic \\"tribes,\\" she was friends with everyone, other prisoners came to her for help with their homework or legal work, she lent out all of her books and gave away all of her possessions, etc. While I liked her voice, I felt she went overboard in trying to portray herself as non-racist, and as someone who didn't feel above everyone she was incarcerated with.    Mostly though, I was disappointed in the ending.  For the last 100 pages, I was looking forward to the end, to what happens when Piper gets home. She ruminates a lot on the balance between getting used to prison rituals but not getting so comfortable that you forget the outside world, so I wanted to know how she found the adjustment to home, whether there was any tension with Larry. Most of all, after she credits the women at Danbury for their friendship and kindness, I wondered if she simply left without turning back or if she kept in touch with anyone, wrote letters, saw anyone who got out on the outside (like Pop)?  I felt robbed of one last chapter, which I felt the book was leading up to.    All in all, this was enjoyable, but not something I'll enthusiastically recommend.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|A lot of people I've talked to says this movie was boring and long, and that is so not true! It was a great movie! I was blown away watching how the relationships between the characters changed. Speaking of which Spiderman goes through serious changes in this movie! The ending moreover, was a blow out! It was awesome! It keep me cringing that everything would turn out ok!
B002VECM6S|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater and could hardly wait to purchase it. It is a very inspiring story of how Christ-like service for someone less fortunate can change a life. It is also a story of overcoming prejudice and how it is possible to better oneself. Very well done.
B003HLM2QO|3.0|I approached Ozzy's new album with an open mind and with the attitude that I won't compare it to any of his previous releases.  I actually give it 2.5 stars. The cd is just plain boring and lame not one song that inspired me to get me excited.
0316113506|1.0|I thought this book was not very informative. Was not what I thought it would be.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|I had been curious about this movie for awhile and was glad to have the opportunity to watch it.<br /><br />The key to the movie is Sam Rockwell who is effective and convincing as Sam Bell who is the only Moon based employee of a large corporation with a mining operation on the moon. Sam's \\"companion\\" a computer named Gerty reminds one of \\"2001 A Space Odyssey;\\" there is a major point of deviation in the ending with Gerty responding very differently from the HAL computer during the climax of the story.<br /><br />The story starts as Sam is nearing completion of a three year contract and is more than ready to go home and see his wife and little girl. The suspense begins to build very nicely when it appears he's not alone on the Moon and then hints begin to be dropped as to what might be actually going on and finally suspicions are confirmed by the end of the movie.<br /><br />If you are a science fiction fan I think you will definitely enjoy it; I found it interesting and worth the time.
B001EP8EL2|1.0|I saw the movie first. It was marginal. I just finished reading the book. It is excellent. Sad that they did not do the book justice. The movie makers destroyed the story. A real butcher job.

0385528752|5.0|Do you ever feel like you want to change something but don't know how? If you are anything like me, this is a challenge you face daily. Luckily for us, the Heath brother has taken upon themselves to create a comprehensive framework for how to go about changing someone or something. What's even better is that they succeeded to write another great book, that lives up to the high expectations from their debut blockbuster Made to Stick.<br /><br />Switch reaches Gladwellian mastery when it comes to readability and entertainment value. But the true value comes with the concrete framework for driving change. Laying out such a framework follows in the tradition of Made to Stick, and has become something of a Heath trademark. With this framework, driving change replaces the guesswork with a more methodological approach to change where the outcome can be predicted.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely and I expect to get as much value out of Switch as I got out of Made to Stick. I can't wait for their next book, whatever it may be.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|Prior to a year and a half ago, most of what I knew of Joan Crawford was from the biopic \\"Mommy Dearest\\" based on the novel written by Joan's adopted daughter, Christina.  Both the book and the film portray Joan Crawford as an immensely insecure, malevolent, narcissistic, disturbed woman...which knowing Hollywood...was probably all true.  Yet despite her personal flaws, she was an undeniably great actress. Her talent jumps off of the screen and into your psyche.  I think her personal trauma enabled her to become 1 of the best actresses to ever grace the silver screen.  She took from her own fragmented existence and brought the characters she portrayed to life!    With that said, Mildred Pierce is a MASTERPIECE!!!  A brilliantly portrayed and directed film with an awesome cast.  It is 1 of Joan's and hollywood's best films!  I'd highly recommend it to anyone that loves classic movies.
B00104W8T6|3.0|I agree with most of the other reviews giving this soundtrack low marks. Not all the songs are great. Better if you've seen and like the movie... etc etc etc. That said, I'm still a sucker for soundtracks because they usually stick to a certain tone that you can match to the mood you are in, but not be stuck with just one artist. And I'll never find the time to make my own mixes, just not a priority.<br /><br />So, if you're in the right mood for it, this is an OK mixed tape.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|Sia's \\"We Are Born\\" was by far my most anticipated release of 2010.  With the release date pushed back at least twice (that I can remember) I was beginning to wonder if 'We Are Born' ever would be.  The wait has been torture, particularly since her live tour wound up preceding the release.<br /><br />It was certainly worth the wait!<br /><br />This record is in general more upbeat, a contrast to previous works which were generally described as 'down-tempo' by most.  While it might be a bit more pop than you're used to, the songs are by no means saccharin - however it IS impossible not to sing along!  I go to bed humming one track and wake up the next morning finishing it the rest of the way through.  There's still a couple of slower tracks if you feel you're in shock ('Be Good To Me', 'I'm In Here') and even a very nice cover of Madonna's 'Oh Father.'  But even in a raucous song like 'Bring Night' Sia's gorgeous voice is unhidden in the mix and draws you right in.<br /><br />We Are Born (titled as such from taking the first 3 words of the first track) might have been a bit late out of the gate, but it's the best present you can get yourself -- just in time for summer!
B001AUKUSG|5.0|Knowing that I loved the few Otis Redding songs that I had heard, my boyfriend picked this CD up for me one night. It was one of the best presents I have ever received, I absolutley love it!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|You can tell Eminem remained focused on this album because there's no tracks that run together and every song has meaning, even if it's just to make you laugh.  Everytime I run the album I have a new favorite song and I'm sure I'll be listening to this all summer.  I'm a huge hip-hop fan and I thought Encore was 'meh', but I actually really liked Relapse, but it did just feel like another Eminem album.  This is the first time in 8 years that he set out to step up and actually top himself.. and he did just that with this one.  Truly an amazing album and it deserves 5 stars.
B003KT3NRA|4.0|Very good album.. Songs sound really good. Vince has always done a super job on cover tunes. Some songs I actually haven't heard from those bands. Tattoos and Tequila sounds really good and the other new song Another Bad Day is tight as well. The only negative I have, actually two, first I wish he would have done a true album because i like his other solo albums and second he should have added his song from a few years ago called Promise Me. Other than that cool album to get and jam to!!!!
B000SEGSB8|5.0|I was SO disappointed in Amazon's handling of this book that I wrote a very nasty one-star review of it.  I don't usually do things like that, but I was angry.  I bought the Kindle version of this book, even though I already own a hardcover copy--a book I treasure and reread, but find difficult to use because it's big and heavy.  When you do a lot of research, portability counts for a lot.  So does Amazon's indexing feature, which makes finding key words and phrases a snap.<br /><br />I have encountered the same problem with a few other Amazon Kindle adaptations, and I've also found some serious problems with typography.  I don't know what Amazon can do to fix these before they hit the market, but I hope that other users respond quickly to let Amazon know when something's wrong with a Kindle adaptation.  In the meantime, we've shelled out money for something that may be even harder to use than the book itself.<br /><br />The original question I posed still stands:  why was a book as important as this one, by an author as celebrated as Judt, published in Kindle format without first indexing it?  The same thing still happens with fresh Kindle editions of similar books.  Meanwhile, why are the trashy paperback rock biographies I have stored on my Kindle thoroughly indexed?  Why do some Kindle books have illegible words and passages due to typographical errors?  Does Amazon use standard methods for transcribing books to Kindle? As a regular Kindle user, I begin to suspect more and more that transcription is probably both automated and outsourced among many different providers, and the inconsistent results are annoying.  I support Amazon's endeavor to make as many books available as possible, for extremely reasonable prices, and I understand the growing pains of nascent technology--but I'm not sure Amazon is addressing the problem in a proactive way.<br /><br />When I visited Amazon's website to lodge a complaint, I found no email address, customer links or other helpfuladvice.  There is no contact information at all, just a mailing address (gee, who is this supposed to \\"help\\"?), a \\"service agreement,\\" and a lot of distracting attempts to lure me back into shopping.  I hated resorting to a nasty review, probably the least likely means of attracting Amazon's attention.  Still, I begged potential buyers to save their money and/or and buy the real thing until Amazon decided that this book was worth a scan and an index.  To Amazon's credit, they fixed it, but it took a while.<br /><br />TO AMAZON, my faithful friend for 15 years and going--add a line in your book description to let us know if it's been indexed.  It's informative to your potential buyer!  Besides, a usable index adds value!  You can charge more!  (Everyone wins!)  And, I beg you, look for corrective measures for typos and other problems in your growing selection of electronic texts.  The day may come when you have serious competition in the electronic book market:  quality of reproduction and faithfulness to the original text may eventually count in Amazon's favor, or not.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Ozzy is 61?  Are you kidding me??  He rocks like a 20 year old!!!  The first 5 songs on this disk completely blew me away, with my favorites being \\"Life Won't Wait\\" and \\"Diggin me Down.\\"  As much as I like Zakk Wylde and didn't want to see him go, I've got to admit that Gus G sounds AWESOME! Rob Zombie's rhythm guys bring a very heavy feel as well.  And to top it all off, Ozzy sounds like the great Ozzy.  The last half of the disk isn't as powerful as the first half, but the more I've listened to it, the more I like it, especially \\"Fearless\\" and \\"I Want it More.\\"  Overall, an extremely solid, heavy sounding album by the KING of heavy metal.  The first half of the album is 5 stars, while the second half is 4 to round it out at 5 (rounding up just for being OZZY!). If you like Ozzy, this album is a must have for your collection (aren't they all?).
B00004STPT|1.0|The amazing music of the soundtrack deserves 5 stars, but the MP3 download version does not! Each track cuts out with a staticky sound right before the song is over. Bad encoding. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. GET THE CD INSTEAD.

B003A4IFGY|3.0|Without question, Tom petty is truly a monolithic rock icon with a body of work that will stand up to the test of time. He has had great albums and not so great albums, but he has always put his heart and soul into everything, usually taking his time thru the recording process. This album was supposed to be departure from his norm in that it was a true 'live' in the studio process, which sometimes yields a more natural feel to the overall energy of the music. Well, having listened to it a couple times, and trust me, i'm not through with it...it plays out like TP sitting in the studio with a really good, muscular bar band. The songs are occasionally opened up in formulaic fashion, and none of the songs resonate in the expected TP fashion. I will never stop following this man, but i do feel that this particular time up at bat makes was a misstep and hopefully this next attempt will be given the time it deserves.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|A little bit of anger, a little bit of humor, a LOT of ego.  Just the way I like my Eminem.
B003HE2B6C|3.0|Not too long ago, I used to blindly rate any Hanson album with \\"FIVE STARS!\\" just because I was so madly in love with them all.  Granted, I still adore them and still think that they are as talented as they ever were, now that I realize that I will never marry Taylor after all, I can rate their music a bit more objectively.    This album sounds a heck of a lot like some of the unreleased Hanson B-sides that used to get leaked out onto Kazaa back in the day.  Not terrible, just very forgettable.    I find that a good deal of the best songs out there fall into either one of two categories: catchy or beautiful, whether lyrically, melodically or otherwise.  A good deal of \\"Shout It Out's\\" mediocre, generic songs frustratingly fall smack dab in the middle of the two.  Most of the melodies wander unpredictably a bit too much to be beautiful (\\"Me, Myself and I\\" tries far too hard to be the next \\"A Song To Sing,\\" but just fizzles), and even after just listening to the album, the tunes of the poppier songs have completely left my head (with the exception of, \\"Thinking 'Bout Somethin,'\\" which echoes of their older days of infectious pop, and the dance to the music video is a total blast, too).    I'm willing to accept the fact that there might never be another album like \\"Underneath,\\" (arguably, their best album to date, in my opinion) or that Hanson might never write another \\"Runaway Run\\" or \\"Crazy Beautiful,\\" but I feel like they really missed the mark here.  I truly feel it is because they've moved on to fulfilling, happy lives with their beautiful wives and scores of little ankle-biters and are too blissfully consumed by their new ways of living to dedicate as much time to song writing anymore.  The talent, I pray, is still there...but it's just gone into hibernation for a while until the little Hanson Jr.'s fly the coop.    So, on a scale of \\"bad\\" to \\"great,\\" I give this a \\"meh.\\"  Dedicated fans should buy this album and support the guys, but if you're new to the scene,invest in a copy of \\"Underneath\\" or \\"This Time Around\\" instead.

I am, however, extremely irritated that Amazon decided to ship me someone's used copy of the disk instead of a new one.  The copy I received had a cracked case and the plastic cover on the case looks like it's been left in the heat too long (all of the other blu-ray movies in this shipment were in perfect condition.  The disks themselves were fine, no scratches or even fingerprints on either of them, but for someone as OCD about their movie collection as I am, this is really irritating.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Well first I want to say, when I heard Zakk Wylde wasn't going to play guitar on this album, I was really dispointed. But After hearing the hole album it sounds really good. Gus G did a really good job. I will say I liked Black Rain a little better than this one, but Its still a strong album for a guy thats over 60 years old.  1.Let It Die - 5/5 - This song is one of my favorites on the album. Good song to start out.  2.Let Me Hear You Scream - 5/5 - The first single, and sounds like a classic Ozzy song.  3.Soul Sucker - 3/5 - I heard a lot of people really liked this song, but I didn't much care for it. I won't say that I hate it, cause I don't really hate any Ozzy song. But this song just didn't do it for me.  4.Life Won't Wait - 5/5 - This song reminds me of a song from No More Tears, or Ozzmosis. But it sounds really good.   5.Diggin' Me Down - 4.5/5 - This sounds reminds me of a Black Sabbath song. It has a relly heavy riff and starts kind of slow like and gets faster as it goes on.  6.Crucify - 3/5 - Not bad just your filler song in my opion.  7.Time - 4/5 - Same with this song. But still pretty good.  8.I Want It More - 4.5/5 -  One of the heaviest songs on the album. Good Ozzy classis.  9.Latimer's Mercy - 3/5 -Not musch to say here just a filler.  10.I Love You All - Im not going to rate this because its not really a song. It only lasts about a minute or so. Its basically Ozz saying thankyou to all his fans, saying You stood by me, god bless you, I Love You all, or something like thats.

0762759437|5.0|This is a must-have for anyone looking for a fun guide to eating in Brooklyn. It has a lot of the favorites, but also things you wouldn't expect. Note, this is not a review book - it doesn't include every place under the sun, just ones the author thinks are worthy of seeking out.  The book is well organized and easy to use, and also small enough to be portable.  This makes a great gift for anyone who loves to explore new places!
B003INJETO|1.0|Yes, yes he has.    I know they were trying for a \\"bold new direction\\" or whatever the lining notes/warning says on the CD, and how they were also going for a 70s vibe and I wouldn't have a problem with either of these things, except for one tiny, minuscule issue -    the songs aren't very good.    There are some flashes of goodness(greatness is nowhere to be found here), but that's what they are, just flashes.  The opening song shows promise, but then the CD devolves into an eye-roller/check the playtime to see when it would end type of thing.  They also throw in more of the nerdish-type \\"humor\\" found on other releases but if I wanted to listen to something funny I would throw my Jerky Boys CDs on. I am listening to music because I want to hear good music.  Seriously, what is \\"Sleeping Under the Stars\\" supposed to be?    I am not at all against bands changing, as long as it is into something good or even better.  If I like it I will continue to buy, but in PoS case I will really, REALLY listen to all tracks before purchasing a new album from them from now on.

030726999X|4.0|I have no idea why I ended up giving this book 4 stars. For 2/3 of it I kept thinking it didn't deserve more than 3, but then once again Larsson added some kick-ass Salander magic and I was pleased.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is definitely the weakest book in the Millenium trilogy.<br /><br />First, it's not really an independent story, but an extension of the previous book - \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" - and almost exclusively deals with the aftermath of it. Lisbeth is in a hospital, recovering from her head wound and awaiting a trial. Her father, Zalachenko, a USSR defector, is in a room just a couple of doors away. The story of Zalachenko cover-up and Salander's imprisonment in a psych ward is about to explode and SAPO's secret Section will stop at nothing to prevent it.<br /><br />Second, we know the bad guys from the get-go. There is no mystery about their identity. Plus, SAPO is weak compared to the powers on Salander's side (press, hackers, police), thus the outcome is predictable beyond doubt.<br /><br />And of course, the familiar flaws of Larsson's books:<br /><br />- the utter irresistibility of Blomkvist - no woman can say \\"no\\" to him, he makes them all feel \\"safe\\" (how he does it, I have no idea - by telling them he doesn't ever commit?), and, of course, he is fabulous in bed (wish Larsson gave us some ideas about Mikael's \\"moves\\").<br /><br />- lack of editing - as always, some trimming is necessary - Larsson tends to write a lot of redundant conversations (for instance, when Salander is in coma, the same information about it is exchanged by at least 5 people on separate occasion).<br /><br />How did I end up enjoying a book with so many flaws? My answer is - Salander. While I still think Larsson has no idea about autism and Lisbeth's characterization as a person with Asperger's syndrome is unrealistic, I love her and enjoy every moment of her kicking ass, be that via hacking or a nail gun. She is undoubtedly the star of this series and I am sad Larsson died so young and there will be no more Millenium books. At least the ending of this book is satisfying, without nasty cliff-hangers and annoying unfinished business.s series and I am sad Larsson died so young and there will be no more Millenium books.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Worked fine on our player and although it doesn't jump out in 3D, it's just as entertaining.  We've watched it three times already.  Always something new and intriguing pops up.  It should have won Best Picture.  Special effects and plot work well, really connected to characters.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|My wife and I were initially hesitant to watch True Blood.  Though I grew up loving Bella Lugosi movies, we are a little too old to get into the teenage \\"vampire hysteria\\" that seems to be dominating current entertainment. But after hearing many friends sing the praises of the show we started watching on DVD - and now we are hooked.<br /><br />True Blood isn't just a vampire story - it combines all kinds of genres; horror, romance, mystery, thriller, and starting in season two you even get a heavy dose of their own take on Greek mythology.  The show gradually tranforms the world into a netherland where vampires, psychics, shapeshifters, and various other creatures of the night - both good and bad - coexist together.  From the title sequence that opens the show it is constantly compelling, original, very sexy, and totally unique.  Definately one of the best shows ever to appear on television.
030726999X|5.0|I am \\"hooked\\" on Stieg Larsson's books and am devasted to know that there will not be others.  This book is the 3rd in the series and just as exciting as the first two.  It was a little \\"slow\\" in the beginning but definitely worth pressing on; it is filled with cleverness and excitement.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|It's great to be listening to a good-quality recording of this old classic while driving to and from work.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|A terrible end to a great show which turned 6 years of invested time to waste. Lost grabbed me as a sci-fi / time travel / philosophical study. The last season focused entirely on the philosophical aspects, completely dropping the other 2/3rds of what made the series great. Either the producers realized too late that 6 seasons really wasn't enough for them to tell their story, or it was a giant bait and switch from the beginning. Either way I am hugely disappointed.
B001ZXT8EK|5.0|WOW. Wow...    Watch this series...It is better than the movies.  It has a rudely dark comedic sense and it is so blatantly unforgiving in its character studies...What a brilliant piece of American Art that slices off our culture in such a imminent and crystallized way...It truly crystallizes the essence of this generation..the fact it is about methamphetamine only adds to the metaphorical genius of the series.

B0013FBS20|1.0|What an awful movie!    I suppose if you like Will \\"I play the same character in every movie\\" Smith then you will probably like this one as well.  But, I would suggest watching The Omega Man for a much better interpretation.  You'll find the bad guys in The Omega Man to be much scarier, yet almost sympathetic creatures.  In I am legend, the creatures are simply unrelenting killer zombies {yawn}.  Plus, The Omega Man has Charlton Heston.  Check out Soylent Green for another great apocalyptic movie.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|As crack cocaine is to inner cities and alcohol is to Indian reservations, so methamphetamine is devastating rural white communities across the United States. WINTER'S BONE, set in the remote Ozark Mountains, hauntingly depicts this plague. The story focuses on 17-year-old Ree Dolly, whose father has disappeared after putting up the family home as bail collateral. Unless she can find him, Ree and her younger brother and sister will be without a roof over their heads.<br /><br />Ree's father is a \\"cooker\\" and her mother has been driven into a catatonic state. Ree is on her own in the hostile, clannish, and male-dominated community where she stumbles from trailer to trailer in her frantic search. Crank's ravages are everywhere, in the gaunt and grim faces, the harsh and sudden violence, the cruelty and hopelessness. Her father's only brother, Teardrop (flawlessly played by John Hawkes), holds a spoonful of the white powder out to her and asks, \\"Gotten the taste for it yet?\\" \\"Not yet,\\" she recoils.<br /><br />Aside from the down-home soundtrack, Winter's Bone is not easy to watch. Its gritty realism never lets up. The characters look like they climbed from Dorothea Lange's Depression and Dust Bowl images, only with a touch of meth-induced paranoia added to the hunger and despair. The dialogue is sparse, and not once in 100 minutes do we hear laughter or feel much hope for Ree's future. What makes it all bearable is the strength and determination of Ree, movingly played by 19-year-old Jennifer Lawrence.<br /><br />Winter's Bone is winning awards and earning rave reviews. The acclaim is well deserved. To achieve authenticity, director and co-writer Debra Granik and her team spent two years immersing themselves in the local community. Ree's younger sister is even played by a child who lives in the main house in which the movie is set. The film's power makes me want to see Granik's 2005 debut film, \\"Down to the Bone,\\" another award winner focused on drug addiction and featuring a strong female lead.<br /><br />Postscript #1: For an excellent critical review, I recommend the Feb. 20 analysis by \\"Turfseer.\\" (As a shortcut to it, you can type amzn.to/hYcDdT into your browser.)<br /><br />Postscript #2: To gain a critical understanding of the meth plague in rural communities of the U.S., I highly recommend Nick Reding's [[ASIN:B00BV2N28S Methland: The Death and Life of an American Small Town]].

B0036EH3X4|1.0|When I first started to watch Lost, I was thrilled to have found such a fresh, interesting new series.<br />6 years later and it feels so pointless having started to watch this show in the first place.<br />If I had known what I know now, I never would started to watch it.<br /><br />I'm always surprised how easily people accept one-line answers as the conclusion of secrets on this show. Maybe people love making theories so much that they don't care if most of the revealations on this show are not worth the wait but I think the creators of Lost were making a fuzz about nothing.<br />This is one of the most pointless shows I've ever watched. Most writers think about 'WHY DO I TELL A STORY' but that thought never seemed to have crossed the mind of the Lost writers. Season 6 is definitely the worst season of the entire show, there is the brilliant 'Ab Aeterno' episode but the rest is lost in a crossover between 'FernGully' meets 'Cast Away'. Lost took pride in being different, being an intelligent drama but in the last season they took the easy way out and decided to become a Disney fairytale. I'm so disappointed.

B0029NY9YO|2.0|Uhh Really this movie was wack....I loved the Comic Book and loved the comic book for what it was...But much of the politics of the Book just dont translate to film because the Director's lack of Creative Vision and he just doesnt have the Guts to add in real time politicians in and replace the throwback 80's mixed made up history stuff....The Film would have been so much more powerful had they Changed the Timeline to Present Day, cut out all those unnecessary shots of DR Manhattan's penis(the whole being naked thing losses its sting after a while and just becomes purely ridiculous), found a better silk specture ....On the bright side Jackie Lee Haley is an awsome Rorscach, Patrick Dem is a great Nightowl, and the Comedian was played very well also....Rent it dont buy it...

I will definitely be buying Donna's other books.
B002ZG98VE|2.0|Those four words completely describe this movie. There's tons of movies like this, you would have thought they would at least try to add some originality.    Who gave this 4-5 stars are oblivious to movies in general and should not be allowed to rate movies PERIOD. I like the main character, but this movie messed him up. It was boring as heck.
B001HN694K|1.0|I cannot recall a more tedious movie experience in recent memory. How you could make such a horrid piece of cinema out of so much potential, is almost unbelievable. The 3D was awefull and added nothing to the spectacle. After the amazing impact of 3D in AVATAR, this is inexplicable. JOHNNY DEPP....without a doubt one of this generations great actors....is unable to rescue his insipid part and his dance at the end is definetly the career low point for DEPP.  BURTON is hit and miss at best and this is the greatest stinker that he has yet produced. It is amazing that the film was released in this form as anyone watching the final cut would have to shudder at the crap they've created. There are so many opportunities for some smart dialogue or some comic scenes with the characters that make up the story, but not ONE opportunity is taken and the dialogue is too stupid for even the youngest viewer. I went with 3 other movie buffs and we all had great trouble staying awake till the end ( which cannot come quick enough ). HORRID HORRID HORRID.......
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Cd came in excellent shape, still wrapped, security stupid tape, a big pain in the Butt.

Can even scratch the case, What a pain, when it refuses to come away in one strip. Anyway back to the Recording. Clean Cd. And original Wicked Cast from Broadway.

The play off from Adina, & Kristen is just a Broadway treasure to behold, & add to your Collection.<br /><br />They're stage presence, make it easy for imatators to imagine they can only do better, but pale in comparison, (Especially that glowing complexion) To the original Dynamic, duo, who will ever be Glendaa the Good, & the Misunderstood, (It isn't easy being, painted Green.) Adina Menzel, as the most sweet, caring witch of the West...<br /><br />This recording is soo much fun, Enjoy the beautiful duo voices of the most unlikely Bffs ever. & listen to songs, like Popular!, sung by Kristen. Who's Glendaa the good's, change of self, centered loving heart, leads to a most wonderous result. & a true Green friend who is just too intellegent for the land of Oz.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|In this age of talentless schlock put out by numerous \\"pop stars\\", it is refreshing to get an album recorded by real musicians. No auto-tune here.    I have never been a huge fan of Cyndi Lauper - I always respected her for being true to her style, and enjoyed seeing her on \\"Celebrity Apprentice\\", but this new album is really something unexpected.  It has a great \\"true blue\\" sound that would resonate throughout times, going both forward and back.  I keep thinking that, if not for the superb digital quality, this album could have been produced 40 or 50 years ago, it just has that timeless quality to it.

0525423842|4.0|In the year 2000, John Grisham did something different. He wrote a novel that was NOT about lawyers. Well, at least it was different for him. The book was originally published in serial form in the Oxford American literary magazine. Subsequently, Doubleday released the book version of A Painted House in January 2001. The author has since released other non-lawyerly stories (Skipping Christmas, also Doubleday 2001; Bleachers, Doubleday 2003; and Playing for Pizza, Doubleday 2007). Now he is again trying something new. This time he is entering the juvenile market--albeit with a lawyer novel.<br /><br />Theo Boone is the thirteen-year-old son of two lawyers--his father, a real estate lawyer, and his mother a successful divorce attorney who only represents the wife. He loves court and all the drama therein. He even loves to watch old Perry Mason reruns with his parents. His dream vacillates between being a high-profile courtroom lawyer and becoming a powerful judge in that same courtroom. In his eighth-grade class, he is the go-to guy for all problems involving the law (from escaped and impounded dogs to arrested brothers). In the midst of the biggest murder trial to hit the town of Strattenburg, Theo finds himself in possession of the only evidence to guide justice. And he's promised not to tell anyone.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced novel which is a great introduction to \\"lawyer fiction\\" for most readers. Appealing about this book is the moving story with rich characters and the absence of foul language and sex scenes that permeate courtroom dramas aimed at an older audience. You can almost overlook the main drawback--scenes that seem to drop a line or two, requiring the reader to fill in a bigger gap than he should.<br /><br />For this excellent effort in introducing his writing to younger audiences, I can award Grisham a solid four out of five reading glasses.<br /><br />--Benjamin Potter, June 23, 2010
0307454541|1.0|I made it to page 73, and it took awhile because I kept putting it down. But now it is down for good. It is a refreshing feeling to quit, a feeling of freedom, like the feeling I imagine you must have when you quit banging your head against a wall. The torture is over.<br /><br />The word \\"boring\\" does not do it justice. This book has a level of boring and dreary that is rarely found in any published work. There is nothing that is even slightly interesting about the people, their actions, their locale etc. The writing is pedantic. At times you feel the writer is trying to kill you with details, boring meaningless uninteresting details.<br /><br />I truly cannot fathom why anyone would enjoy reading this. That is the real mystery associated with this book - how did it get published, and why do people read it? Are there really people whose lives are so boring that they think this drek is interesting?
B001RTSPVY|2.0|I revised my review because some cry baby thought that I revealed too much, which I don't believe is true but to placate his feelings I've added SPOILER ALERTS Maybe he is partaking of some of the product that Walt manufactures.  SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT  I loved the first season of this show. The premise sounded so improbable - a 50 year old high school chemistry teacher with a pregnant wife and a teenage son with cerebral palsy is diagnosed with lung cancer. He goes on a ride along with his DEA agent brother in law and sees an old student fleeing the house where the meth is being cooked. He sees the huge amounts of money to make in the meth trade. Since he's uninsured he decides to go into the meth business - he'll be the cook and his ex-student the dealer. Most meth dealers are not the kind of people you want to spend time with or even think about, but Brain Crandon (sp?) makes the protagonist sympathetic - an every man who has been screwed by life. Even the street dealer is someone you identify with, a young man who is a big disappointment to his family and trying to prove himself, albeit in a criminal enterprise. The chemistry between them is great, and they have many laugh out loud funny scenes. The whole cast is excellent.    Season 2 started out in the same general vein, but towards the end veered off into something really disturbing and depressing. If the writers were trying to be more realistic about the ravages of meth on the customers, and the ruthlessness of the dealers, they succeeded. Walter White, the main character becomes ruthless to the point of cruelty even to his own son (getting him drunk at a family party celebrating his cancer going into remission) and trying to pick a fight his brother in law, who has been nothing but good to him. It get even worse, with a really neat character dying of an overdose. That's where I stopped watching.
B003HLM2QO|1.0|This cd is like no other Ozzy album.It sucks.The New Guitarist Gus G Sounds like he is able to play but is NOT very creative.VERY repetitive sounding.This album also has Absolutely NO melody,no good hooks and the lyrics are so bad at times you just gotta laugh.This is pure industrial rock that went outta style about 15 years ago.Here is what I think happened......read is Sharon Osbournes voice \\"Ozzy you have got to keep current and play for a younger audience and this is what the kids are all rocking too these days......etc........\\" and here is the reply.Please read in Ozzy's voice \\"If you say so,Sharon.You've never steered me wrong before.I will miss the days when I put out good solid rock with creative lyrics and catchy riffs and hooks,but you know best,my darling Sharon.......etc........\\" I am the BIGGEST Ozzy fan on the planet and I am telling you to steer clear of this one.Shame on you Ozzy!!!!!!!

0439023483|2.0|There are two ways to think about this book. It's either a satire of modern reality TV shows like Survivor, or a novelization of a violent 3D video game like Doom.     Either way, the story is not believable and makes little sense..that is, this is not something that could happen in the real world with real human beings. As one example, in real life, arbitrarily and publicly taking away your citizen's innocent children to die violent deaths would lead to a revolt among the provinces, not make one less likely.     The character names, as others have mentioned, are kind of silly, but that's a comparatively minor problem. The violence is gruesome without any redeeming value and the romantic sub-plot serves only to pluck at readers' hear-strings.(The emotional manipulation quotient in this book in general is sky-high...no subtlety here.)     This book is correctly labeled YA. It is predictable and cloying. Grown-ups stay away.
0307474712|4.0|After reading a newspaper article about Anne Hathaway starring in this Brit bestseller I ordered it from Amazon the minute it came available via overnight express.  I know, I know, I know I have issues with patience. Something the book's heroine, Emma Morley, had tons of regarding her lengthy infatuation of our hero, Dexter Mayhew. The plot summary has already been told in other reviews, so no need to repeat it in this one. Although I will say the author fleshed out the characters wonderfully. This was a long read for me but it did keep up my interest enough to finish it. There were many points in the story that I wanted to give them both a 'good shake' as they say in England and tell them to 'get on with it'. The book's saving grace was the dialogue, sharp, witty, interesting, funny and poignant.  Here's hoping the screenplay, also being written by the book's author, has the same smart repartee.<br /><br />06/25/10 Update:  Picked as People's magazine Pick of the Week Book.  I'm sure this will generate a greater reader crowd.<br /><br />Enjoy the read!

B0007KTAU4|4.0|I heard this on the sound track of the movie 500 Days of Summer, and had to know what it was -- by hitting the pause button on the credits discovered, to my great surprise, that it was Carla Bruni.  I think the last picture of her I saw was of dinner at the White House.  I downloaded the title number and the 'I've Known a Few' from iTunes and play them all the time.  The collection is intimate, and quiet.  A pleasant voice, but as far from Edith Piaf as one could get.  Quiet, personal, wry, perhaps, definitely talented.  Nothing better to make someone want to learn French and even pick up a guitar.  I still don't know what the song is about.  I am sure whoever put it on the sound track of the movie did.

B003HLM2QO|5.0|The title of this review might not sound too enthusiastic, but I've been listening to Ozzy for about 25 years, and while I'm not going to hype this CD and say it's the best thing I've heard since whatever previous album, I do like it quite a lot and think it has merit.  Some fans bash any modern Ozzy music, but a lot of things on Scream sound great, and even though it might not be perfect, and even though it might not even be a masterpiece, I know I'll be listening to it many, many times in the next few weeks and months.<br /><br />In my opionion, here's what is positive about Scream:<br />--The music.  I've always been a fan of older Ozzy music, and this has some elements of that sound.  For example, every song boasts great leads, and Gus G does a tremendous job overall.  The quality of songs on the last few Ozzy albums has been inconsistent, but Scream has ten solidly structured songs with choppy, sometimes thrashy metal riffs, the already mentioned excellent leads, and just a feel of quality musicianship (again, for the most part).  Several songs remind me of Ultimate Sin-era Ozzy, which is a great thing for me, because that was a classic 80's metal album that wasn't a fan favorite at the time (although Ozzy's highest-selling solo album up until then), but can be appreciated fully now over two decades later.<br /><br />--Ozzy's vocals.  The first song, Let It Die, threw me a little, because Ozzy's vocals in the verses have effects on them and aren't that great.  But then, from Let Me Hear You Scream on to the end, I was pretty damn impressed.  Ozzy's voice is sometimes vintage-sounding, but mostly just strong, clear, and catchy, which is vintage in itself.  I think he sounds better than on Black Rain, and less commercial than on Ozzmosis or Down to Earth.<br /><br />--Diggin' Me Down, Soul Sucker, Time, and others.  I don't see how any long-time Ozzy fan could not like Diggin' Me Down, one of the heaviest tracks on an Ozzy album in awhile.  Soul Sucker was supposed to be the title track, and I think it's a great song.  People just got confused over what it was supposed to mean (as in, \\"I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka!\\").  I didn't think I'd like Time at first, but it really builds and ends up being pretty memorable.  It might be a sleeper to end up as a favorite.  All of the other songs are pretty good, too; these just stood out after the first listen.<br /><br />--Metal.  This album sounds more like real heavy metal than the more modern metal-rock that Ozzy's been doing for years.  And while I've liked Ozzy's last few albums, I'm a metal fan first and foremost, so it's great to hear Ozzy's voice behind music that sounds like good, hard metal.  Gus G sounds incredible on this, and he's clearly distinct from Zakk, Jake, and Randy.  And even though he didn't do any writing for Scream, he undeniably put his imprint on the songs, and he plays with a lot more fire than Zakk did on Black Rain.<br /><br />That said, I'm about done.  I don't have much negative to say here, other than the fact that this won't top Blizzard, or Diary, or Bark at the Moon.  So what?  If new Ozzy sounded like crap, I'd say hang it up, but if I've been listening to him for 25 years, and I still think his new stuff sounds good, then what the hell?  I'm not giving him five stars out of sympathy; this is a good new metal album that's not perfect, but is well above average.  Thanks Ozzy for solo album number 10.  I hope you keep Gus G and let him help write number 11.and I think it's a great song.  People just got confused over what it was supposed to mean (as in, \\"I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka!\\").

B003TA69A8|3.0|We started off the new season with a BANG, I must say.  Episode 1, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" was not only cleverly titled (being the introduction of The Doctor's officially recognized eleventh incarnation) but brilliantly scripted, acted and fully realized.  It hit all of the right notes and flung Matt Smith unceremoniously and undeniably into the shoes of all those Doctors that have gone before.  However, I confess that I was seriously underwhelmed by most of what followed for the remainder of the season.  Karen Gillen's Amy Pond is a stiff, pouty, two dimensional character that just leaves me cold and makes me miss the vivacity and bravado of Billie Piper and Katherine Tate.  In fact, one of the best episodes in this season, \\"The Lodger\\", has incredibly little to do with Amy Pond (thankfully) and allows Matt Smith's doctor to bounce appealingly through an episode unencumbered by the millstone of his leaden companion.    Episodes to catch:  \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", \\"The Beast Below\\", \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" and \\"The Lodger\\".  I am assuming that the final two episodes of the season will be must-sees, being as they form a two-part season ender (they have yet to air in the US), but other than those, I found this season rather disappointing.  So much so, in fact, that I would mourn neither the loss of this doctor nor his companion were they both to perish in the finale and cause another dice-roll regeneration.    Perhaps a ginger at last?
B003PWPGT0|5.0|Allow me to start by saying that I've only been modestly Heartbroken by Petty etal in the past, tending to favor his solo material over the more radio-friendly catalog from the '80s. When I caught them on SNL season finale a few weeks ago (Alec Baldwin 5/16/10) it was transcendental. I was counting the nanoseconds before \\"Mojo\\" dropped. Got my mitts on it immediately upon release. And am not crestfallen, in the least.    At once lyrically vulnerably piercing and muscularly pulsing, this platter caroms effortlessly from rock to blues to reggae to roots-a-billy. You hear echoes of \\"Abbey Road-era Beatles in the denouement \\"Good Enough\\" that takes your breath away...that is if you are still breathing by then. The single, \\"I Should Have Known It\\" struts with a Led Zep stomp - the only thing missing is Plan's histrionics. One can hear Allman Brotheresque tones in the jazzy almost prog \\"First Flash Of Freedom\\". Knopfler and gang could have easily been mistaken on both \\"Running Man's Bible\\" & \\"The Trip To Pirate's Cove\\". \\"Candy\\" hearkens back to late '50s-early '60s boogie-billy rock popularized by anyone from Chuck Berry to Johnny Rivers. \\"No Reason to Cry\\" finds Tom channeling his inner Bobby Z. by way of contemporary Nashville. In \\"Something Good Coming\\", I'm hearing echoes of the late Warren Zevon. And on & on & on. It is that rarity of an album that actually has NO weak cuts and in fact, I am hard-pressed to cite my fave. Same for my wife, who has goosebumps & tears.    So those few that have scorned the disc clearly haven't a clue what good tuneage is and their comments confute any possible sophistication and/or taste. There are Petty fans then there are petty fans. Too bad for them, um...more for us? ;-v}    Note, if you buy the CD or download the tracks here, hie thee in a nonce over to the black hats at that place that rhymes with myGoons and download the bonus track \\"Little Girl Blues\\" a dynamo of rock craftsmanship by Petty, Tench, Campbell and gang.    So pretty soon the whole world will be gettin' their \\"Mojo\\" woikin'
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I've been a fan of Nathan Fillion since FIREFLY.  This show teams him with Stana Katic, and the screen burns with their chemistry.  Throw in a fantastic supporting cast: Jon Huertas, Seamus Dever, Susan Sullivan, Molly Quinn, and Tamala Jones, and you have a show that you must watch every week.  Every character is pitch perfect, no one over acts, each character's got a great back story.  Five stars here.
B003A4IFDW|5.0|I love Bettye LaVette, and I did not hesitate to purchase her most recent release, \\"Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook.\\"  That being said, I had some mild concerns about how she would handle these fairly pop songs, some though not all of which were very well known to me.  Well it only took one listen for me to realize that any concerns that I had were unwarranted, so have no fear about purchasing this CD and supporting this incredible songstress, who deserves to be much better well known than she is, unfortunately.  As per usual, Bettye wrenches all of the heartache possible out of these songs.  Even though most of the songs involve horn and/or string arrangements, the instrumentation is not over the top, which is one of the concerns that I had before hearing the CD.  Whether you are a fan of Bettye LaVette or are a fan of British rock, who is open to hearing a blues/soul take on some classic songs, this CD is highly recommended.
B000051YD6|5.0|I bought this CD to replace a recording I used to have.  I've listened to many versions through the years. Claudio Arau's stands head and shoulder's above the rest.  If you are a fan of Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, this CD should be in your collection.
0805091742|5.0|I admit, when I first saw this book perched on the bestseller shelf I was skeptical about how the idea of a checklist could be so revolutionary. Revolutionary enough to create a manifesto, in fact. Who isn't familiar with checklists, and how in the world could someone create an entire book promoting their usefulness? (Uh, duh.) Needless to say, by page three of the book I was sold.<br /><br />The whole premise of the book is that effectively developed and implemented, a simple checklist serves as the hero for managing the complexity that our vast amounts of accumulated knowledge have created.  It helps to make sure that the \\"stupid but critical stuff\\" is not missed while ensuring \\"people talk and coordinate and accept responsibility while nonetheless being left the power to manage the nuances and unpredictabilites the best they know how.\\"  As Atul explains:<br />\\"The checklist gets the dumb stuff out of the way, the routines your brain shouldn't have to occupy itself with (Are the elevator controls set? Did the patient get her antibiotics on time? Did the managers sell all their shares? Is everyone on the same page here?), and lets it rise above to focus on the hard stuff (Where should we land?).\\"<br /><br />Both the content and writing of _The Checklist Manifesto_ are brilliant. Just like the checklist itself, Atul is able to manage vast amounts of knowledge into a simply effective masterpiece. His book reads like a novel (where the checklist, of course, is the protagonist), but informs like a panel of experts.<br /><br />Perhaps a checklist is appropriate for reviewing this book:<br />---Does it provide a convincing argument for the power of checklists?<br />Check.<br />---Does Atul's masterful writing leave the reader both awestruck and informed?<br />Check.<br />---Is it entertaining, engaging, (surprisingly) fascinating, and practically impossible to put down?<br />Check.<br />---Is it one of those books that gets into your brain and uncannily stays there?<br />Check.<br />---Is it without a doubt worth checking out?<br />Check.<br /><br />So, put this on the To Read list. And, expect to be transformed by the time you're able to check if off.?   Check.    So, put this on the To Read list. And, expect to be transformed by the time you're able to check if off.
B003ELOQCU|5.0|There are only certain \\"Special Editions\\" that I will purchase because they really seem \\"special.\\"  For example, the Blade Runner box set in the suitcase.  The James Bond set - got it on Amazon for a great price and it has lots of extras.  And now, the U2 Super Deluxe Set for U2360.  This show, I believe, is the one that was broadcast over Youtube and it was amazing.  A real mix of new and old songs.  This set also comes with the tour program, as well as those fun extras that we've all come to know and love. I'm not going to rehash what's in the set.  Sure, you don't really need U2 guitar picks, but for the cost of the whole set, it's kind of fun to have.  The set is beautifully packaged and the materials are good quality.  The hardback book is kind of cool too, plus a single called \\"Soon.\\"  I have not listened to it yet. But it's U2, so most likely, I'll like it.<br /><br />If you're as big a fan of U2 as I am, you'll enjoy the set.  For average fans who just want to see a good show, get just the DVD. But diehards,  I don't think you'll be disappointed with this set.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I've never thought I'd like any thing from Cyndi Lauper,<br />but this album is really good!<br />In the past I haven't been interested in her music,<br />but who knew she could come up with such a great blues album!<br /><br />Her voice masterfully channels these songs,<br />she sounds passionate, and soulful.<br />I didnt know she had it in her, but this album has shown me different.<br />Here she truely sounds like the Memphis blues.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|For me this was Heart wrenching to watch yet I somehow found the strength to watch a master at his best! I never had the chance to see MJ in concert so to me this is the best next thing.  Michael was simply out of this world...I truly believe he belonged to another realm...he was so misunderstood here on earth.  This movie not only proved the purpose of his being here which was to entretain the world through his art but also showed us a glimpse of the man...a man that was a human being just like all of us. I love you Michael you will always have a special place in my heart....miss you everyday!Your music will live on for centuries to come.

I'm recommending it to everyone: dog lovers, book lovers, anyone who likes an insightful, emotional, funny, creative, memorable work that will thoroughly engage them to its rewarding end. I loved the dog, the man, the heart that went into this story.
B000244FDW|1.0|One of the things I love about Pride and Prejudice is the wit/humor in it -- this version seems to suck the life and humor right out of the story. Propriety is one thing, but some of Austen's characters are intentionally over the the top, and so I think it's fitting that in other versions the characters express that energy and sense of humor. Here they are just dry, and while the script doesn't eliminate all of the humor, it's delivered so poorly as to fall completely flat.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|This isn't so much a true album as an EP of songs from the movie combined with a few singles to fill out the track list. As such, it's a bit less cohesive than other works by The Beatles, but also features a higher than average amount of songs that I've actually heard before. It's mostly pretty catchy, and also has a bit of their creepier mood keeping it interesting. I haven't actually seen the Magical Mystery Tour film, and I think it would be interesting to see how all of the songs on the first half play into it. \\"Flying\\" is an instrumental, but the rest are otherwise pretty normal for The Beatles, mostly sung by Paul. Two standouts on that side are George's \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and John's \\"I Am the Walrus\\", which have a bit more of an edge to them.    The parade of radio hits on the second side is pretty impressive, with only one song (\\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\") that I wasn't familiar with. It's a pretty good one though, and along with the rest, especially \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", it's a very fun, listenable set. I tend to prefer The Beatles songs that branch out a bit, but one of their strengths is definitely just well-constructed pop songs. It makes for a record that doesn't reach the brilliant heights of some of their other work, but is still perfectly fine for what it is.
0307463745|4.0|Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson has been in Amazon's top ten list for a couple months and for good reason, it's captivating, easy to read, engaging, and fun. However, I was disappointed with the lack of references. If the authors had referenced sources that back up their refreshing new take on old opinions (texts like the [[ASIN:0201835959 The Mythical Man-Month]], [[ASIN:0932633439 Peopleware]], [[ASIN:0735619670 Code Complete]], [[ASIN:0321344758 Don't Make Me Think]], etc...) then Rework would have a bigger impact on its readers. Unfortunately, without solid external references this book is too easily passed of as highly opinionated and subjective.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|I don't get why this movie is receiving such low ratings. It is very entertaining, and has plenty of action and dark comedy. I've never read any of the comics, so I couldn't compare it. Josh Brolin pulls an amazing performance as Jonah Hex. One night, Jonah's commanding officer, Quentin Turnbull murders Jonah's family and brands his face with a hot iron. Jonah is revived by Native American and is given supernatural powers to temporarily resurrect and communicate with the dead. Jonah learns that Turnbull is planning on building a weapon to destroy the United States. He teams up with a gun-slinging prostitute named Lilah and tries to stop him, and get the revenge he deserves. I highly recommend JONAH HEX!!!

This record might be too smart and advanced for today's hip hop climate. I love music that challenges me as a listener. The Recovery album is the battery that hip hop needed to charge up lyricism on a higher level. Eminem is insightful and profound on over 95% of this Lp.  The rest is what I love most about Eminem.... Skills, lyrical exercises!  \\"Not Afraid\\" is incredible yo.  My personal favorite is \\"Going through changes\\"  masterful.  Welcome back Shady!!!!
1591843162|5.0|I loved Seth's latest book Linchpin, but Linchpin is not for everyone.  There is a certain percentage of the population that doesn't want change, hates the concept of personal development, especially when it comes to them, is not interested in new ideas and prefers to pretend like Candide in Voltaire's novel by the same name that - \\"all must really be for the best and that hard work, from day to day is what life is about.\\"<br /><br />Linchpin is a must read for anyone interested in improving the quality of their working life and is written in an accessible way that will appeal to a very broad audience.  Seth's has written 12 books and his blog is the top rated blog from 150 marketing blogs rated by Advertising Age - if you haven't subscribed yet, you can do so here.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is that it captures the essence of why change is needed in our society and it identifies what prevents most people from getting the success they really want (the resistance), and offers a formula for success for anyone wanting to create a remarkable future.<br />The Old American Dream was<br />Keep your head<br />Follow Instructions<br />Show up on time<br />Work Hard<br />Suck it up...and you will be rewarded. As we've seen, that dream is over.<br /><br />Seth also passionately advocates a move away from the factory model of education, where we teach compliance in our schools to produce workers who are no longer needed as cogs in the machine, because the cogs are cheaper and more readily exploitable elsewhere.<br /><br />The new American dream is this;<br />Be remarkable<br />Be generous<br />Create art<br />Make Judgement calls<br />Connect people and ideas.<br />What schools need to teach for contributors in the new American dream are<br />1. Solve interesting problems<br />2. Lead<br /><br />Seth fuses core ideas from human needs psychology into the concept of the lizard brain or The Resistance. The Lizard brain is what keeps us alive, it's responsible for our fight/flight mechanism and is constantly seeking certainty, variety and significance. It's also the thing that holds us back; the thing that has us checking our email 50 times a day to see if anyone sent anything interesting to us, checking our blog traffic and commentary to see if anyone left any comments and said anything nice about us.<br /><br />The resistance is also what separates us from our destiny and it show's up as fear; fear of the unknown, fear of making your own map for your life, fear of failure, fear because you or your ideas could be rejected. Fear show up in the form of procrastination, which keeps you in the office for 10+ hours a day and leaving work not having achieved anything, but staying busy.<br />Seth asks, if you just had 5 hours to do meaningful work during the day instead of the 10-15 you currently spend, what would you do differently?<br /><br />Linchpins feel the fear, acknowledge it and proceed anyway....Seth doesn't tell you how to do this, because its personal, but it is what is needed in today's economy to make a difference.<br /><br />The essence of the linchpin, whether they are in sales, marketing, engineering or a volunteer in a non-profit is<br />1. Providing a unique interface between members of the organization (using emotional labor, finesse and intuition- its not in the manual)<br />2. Delivering unique creativity  (meaning they contribute domain expertise, their passion and risk rejection to get the really important stuff done - They SHIP!)<br />3. Managing a situation or organization of great complexity (there's no manual, you make it up to achieve a result from great complexity - you make your own map)<br />4. Leading Customers (sales and marketing leadership opportunities occur at every touch-point with a customer/consumer/donor.<br />5. Inspiring Staff (Linchpins make things happen vs being told what to do and inspire others to take initiative for themselves)<br />6.

B0032FPVKE|5.0|I just received this case in the mail and I am quite pleased. It is small, black and compact. Yet, it has many nice features that most will love. It comes with both an optional shoulder strap and loops that you can use to secure this to a belt. If you use the belt option, the zippers open toward you for extra security. There are three compartments that you can use to place batteries, storage cards, and other essentials. The inside of the case is padded nicely, and contains a Velcro divider that you can use to make your camcorder snug, while creating a second compartment in the case for more equipment.<br /><br />Over all, I think this is a great value for your money and I would highly recommend it!

Ozzy is Forever!
B00005NC66|2.0|\\"Breathless\\" is a French film made in 1960, and it is a great departure from what I had expected.  It was different, but did not appeal to me because it seemed a mumbo-jumbo of a film.  The script seemed like it was pieced together out of newspaper clippings as dialogue was chopped and all over the map.<br /><br />The movie opens up with a young thief, Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo) stealing a car and eventually shooting a cop.  He runs from the crime and steals a car to get to Paris and shacks up with Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American who sells the New York Herald Tribune International on the streets of Paris.  Michel hides out in her hotel room while trying to sell Patricia on a plan to go with him to Italy.  She soon realizes that includes a journey into criminal life, which is overwhelming.<br /><br />The film is in black and white, with subtitles.  The conversations are constantly cut and pasted throughout, you feel you are hearing just parts of conversation.  The thief, Michel, is a bit odd in all his car-jacking and running around like a cartoon figure at times.<br /><br />It is full of prattlings on life and goals, and some scenes go on forever with close-ups of the lovely Jean Seberg.  It seemed to be a film to frame her talents and beauty, but frustrating in weak plot and abrupt scene changes.<br /><br />If you like foreign films, and the beginnings of a new free-form style, this would be interesting study.  As for entertainment, it was insipid
0061922315|4.0|Shilpi Somaya Gowda writes a novel with two separate, parallel stories tied together by an adopted child.  She beautifully developed the story about the Indian mother who gave her daughter up for adoption.  Gowda did a phenomenal job developing the Indian characters and skillfully described their struggles in rural India and Mumbai.  She brought to life the struggles of underprivileged Indian families, families that immigrate from rural to urban Indian cities, the preference for male babies, and the hardships of Indian women.<br /><br />Gowda fell short in the development of the American story, which included the stories of the adopted daughter and her parents.  She began the novel by describing the adopting mother's struggle with infertility; however, she drops this storyline after adoption of the child.  At one point in the novel, the adopting mother and father separate. The couple reunites after the mother finds a lump in her breast. I found this storyline to be contrived.  Furthermore, the adopted daughter spends one year during college in India so that she can write a story about poverty, but Gowda only mentions two days of interviews conducted by the daughter with people who lived in the Indian slums.  Gowda does a beautiful job describing Indian society, so I was disappointed that she did not examine this storyline further.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings of the American storylines, I enjoyed the Indian part of the novel so much that I finished the novel in less than two days.  I recommend this book.
B002HREKCI|4.0|This is a book that is impossible to put down. I was actually shocked at how interesting the story was and how everything was tied together. Clay is a sweetheart from the beginning and you can't help but wonder where he fits into the story along the way. Hannah is a little confusing and frustrating but I guess that is part of the point. It was one of the most suspenseful books I have read in a while. I wanted to see where, or who, everything ended with.<br />Although at the end I was a little disapointed in the overall message of the book, it was still a great, quick read that appeals to guys and girls. The voice changes from Hannah to Clay throughout the story which gives for a much needed breather in between the sections and helps explain certain parts.<br /><br />I have wanted to read this book for a while and I am not at all disapointed. It's easy to see how suicide changes not only the lives of the person or immediate family members, but others who were touched by the person along the way.
B003K025V4|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter and I have toi say this CD exceeded my expectations.  From the second the first track started I knew this wasn't Hannah Montana.

0802798225|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to read this book. It really is an amazing love story. Brittany is the \\"perfect\\" girl in school. She is beautiful, smart, and popular. Alex is from the other side of town and is a member of a very dangerous gang. From the outside they seem to have nothing in common, but once they are placed together to work on a chemistry project they learn that maybe they are more alike than they thought.<br /><br />We follow each character as the story alternates from Brittany's perspective to Alex's. We get to view each of their lives as we are carried through the story. I loved how Simone Elkeles gradually lets us get to know Brittany and Alex. It seems that we learn about them, at the same time they are learning about themselves. The gang aspect of the story seemed very real and believable. I could see the struggle Alex faced each day and how much pressure he was under due to the gang. No answer would be without consequence in this story. So many stories seem to have an easy way out, but in this story it was easy to see how hard some decisions really are.<br /><br />Brittany and Alex struggle to stay together even when the world seems to want them apart. Brittany's home life is full of stress and pressure from her parents, while Alex feels the need to do anything to protect his family. This story goes a lot deeper than the love story. It deals with pressures, family life, gangs, violence, drugs, sex...everything that teenagers sometimes face. Once you read this book it will stay with you. You will remember the lessons it brings to the surface and appreciate each word.<br /><br />This book is highly addictive and you won't be able to put it down. I wouldn't recommend it for younger teens or anyone who may be offended by cursing or sexual material.This is a breathtaking story. You will find yourself laughing, crying, and rushing through the pages to see what happens next.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|If you're a Blues fan, you will love this cd. As a both a Blues and Cyndi Lauper fan, I was a little skeptical when I first heard the album concept prior to release. Certainly she has the pipes but was the Blues a good fit for her voice and styling? The answer is a resounding yes! I am blown away by how much I am enjoying this album. You go, girl!
0385732554|5.0|Imagine a world with no hunger, poverty, malice, competition, hatred or war. Then imagine that world with no recollection of the past, no colors, no snow, no mountains, no sunshine, and more. Sameness. Complete order. That is how one would describe Jonas' world. Proves to say that there is no such thing as a perfect world...    Everything and anything that you do are dictated by a council called the Elders. There are rules even for the puny little things. You cannot ask questions that will make it awkward for the other person, you have to use specific phrases for everything, you cannot ride a bike until you turn nine, you are not to lie, cheat or get jealous. One must take a pill when you reach the time of stirring or wet dreams to suppress the urges. You have a biological mother yet you will never meet her and she will never meet you. Cruel? No because in Jonas' community, they are called Birth mother, it is their job. A world where in you get released when you get old or if a newborn did not meet the community's standard for being healthy. A world where you are given a career at the age of twelve, a career that will be your until you grow old.    I would have a really strong feeling of dislike for the people living inside Jonas' community if not for their innocence? ignorance? I cannot really describe how I feel, I was so conflicted. The plot was set further into the future where in only one person have the memories of the past and he is called the Giver, Jonas was chosen to carry these memories and is now called the Receiver. It is an eerier version of Pleasantville and a world with a lot of red flags for human rights violation and a community that would sure get swamped with activists of all sorts.I LOVE IT. The strangeness, the obscurity, even if their rules were so infuriating. It is a fascinating read. Definitely a classic. Something that you'll read more than once.
B00005YUPO|5.0|We purchased Baby Einstein: Baby Bach on DVD when our son was born. He is now five years old and we have a three year old daughter and they still both love the DVD.  Only now, they watch it when they want to calm down and relax. I watched it with both children when they were infants and they were always mesmerized and interactive with the music and images.

B000I2J6K0|4.0|A friend recommended this video and I purchased it when I was about 20 weeks pregnant. It has been the best thing I could have done for me and my baby! It is such an easy workout to follow and Erin is not overly cheesy and annoying. I also like the fact she is in a \\"home\\" atmosphere. It gives the feeling you are working out with a friend. The intro is really annoying and I usually skip it. I like the fact that all the props she uses are things you already have in your house. I was running and doing normal physical activities in my first trimester but it got too uncomfortable in the second. I do the extra movements and try to challenge myself and usually end up breaking a sweat. This workout video is a steal for the money!!
0618918248|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for answers to Life, the Universe and Everything (with apologies to Douglas Adams - read that one too!). Written with passion and insight it makes compelling reading. If you are an independent thinker, a quester for answers to the origin of the human race and one who has an open mind about the effect that mythology (religion) has had on human history, you will find this book enthralling. This book should appeal to atheists because it tells them that they no longer have to put up with mythologies foisting their views on them and they should be confident and proud to be an independent thinker. The book should also be read by creationists because how can you condemn it if you haven't read it? (Notice how many people condemn evolution without ever having opened a book of Darwin's and yet non adherents to mythology seem to have read many of the great mythological works such as the Bible). Read it. It may change your life. You won't regret it.
B0029LX2LC|4.0|I have been coppin The Roots albums since (The Tipping Point) so i may not be the hardcore 90's Roots supporter but i know good music. This album is well done. Its no Game Theory but damn good. Rising Down may be my favorite of the Def Jam releases. It might be time to go back and get their earlier albums. This is my 4th Roots albums ive bought......and they   haven't dissapointed me yet. God Bless True Hip Hop.
067960085X|5.0|As a long time fan of the movie version of Breakfast at Tiffany's, I was wary of reading the book. I knew the book and movie versions were quite different and I wasn't sure I could put aside the image of Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly long enough to appreciate the book on its own. But I shouldn't have worried. The book is such a gem that it's easy to separate it from the movie and appreciate each on its merits. Capote's writing is mesmerizing. As the quote on the back from Norman Mailer puts it, \\"He writes the best sentences word for word...\\" and it is so easy to lose yourself in the worlds Capote creates. The other stories in this volume were a little hit or miss for me. I didn't really get \\"House of Flowers\\" but \\"A Diamond Guitar\\" was poignant and \\"A Christmas Memory\\" was heartbreakingly beautiful.

045122499X|5.0|I'm very picky about the fiction I read and sometimes have a hard time sticking with a book if it doesn't engage me from the start. This one, along with Pillars of the Earth, does just that. The plotlines are interesting, the characters are well developed, the action is quick, the descriptions are detailed, and I felt like I got a great brush-up on medieval history. As with Pillars of the Earth, there are a lot of characters, and I almost wanted to make notes of them on the inside back cover so I could keep everyone straight! In a nutshell, this is a GREAT STORY. The one quibble I have is that, unlike Pillars of the Earth, this book seems to overdo it on the sex scenes. There are more of them and they're more detailed. I'm not opposed at all to this type of content, but I feel like anytime some element of a book pulls you out of the experience for a minute because it's distracting or annoying, then that element has lost its effectiveness. I would have edited down or out some of these passages so that those that remained were more effective for their purpose. That said, I have lent this book and Pillars to numerous friends and always recommend this duo first when someone asks for a book recommendation.
0670827592|4.0|This book was written for children, so one shouldn't expect too much out of analysis. It was a very simple, fun story that gave an interesting point of view (and being written by Jon Scieszka, of course there's slight dark humor thrown in) concerning the story of the Three Little Pigs. The plot is a little repetitive (well, it is a story where the driving plot is to blow down the house of three separate pigs in the same manner), and I think it should have included more details and back story. But overall it's fun... it brings back childhood memories for me at least.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Some of the best songs lyrically by Eminem are contained on this album.  The only song that i did not like was on fire, the rest were incredible.  Although many songs are slow and some love songs, they have a deeper meaning which makes up for it.  Lyrically won't back down is the best, but best sounding would either go to not afraid or almost famous.  This album is a must-have.  By it if you support Eminem.    P.S. Eminem backwards is Menime
B00004XMTJ|1.0|Unwatchable. Dreadful. Boring beyond belief. Maybe on stage it was fine, but as a video \\"movie,\\" it is horrifyingly stupid. Hyper-kinetic editing stuffed with closeups that make one aware of actors made up cutesy to look like cats who act like humans when they appear in musicals. The concept is nuts. Eliot's poems are inflated and robbed of all charm. Do not waste your money. The Cats phenomenon, whatever it once meant, is now a thing a thing of the past. Maybe Eliot will get his book back.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Toy Story 2 is my favorite. The first one was good and I just saw the third one and that was good too but this one is just the best. The DVD is also because of all the good bonus features it has on it. Outtakes, music videos, deleted scenes, games and more. It's great and funny and I loved it. Get it and don't talk to any toy you don't know.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is a lovely film set during Christmas time and centered around the troubles of a Bishop  maintaining his work/life balance. Suffice it to say, the Bishop fails miserably at maintaining the balance and focuses far too much on fund raising for his glorious new chapel that he has in mind.  In the meantime, his wife (aptly portrayed by Loretta Young) is increasingly unhappy and his young daughter rarely ever sees him.  In an unexpected answer to a prayer, Cary Grant appears as an angel sent to help.  And several lovely scenes ensue where he helps people.  However, the Bishop starts to get jealous as Cary Grant \\"Dudley\\" spends so much time with his wife.  Eventually, we are treated to a lovely Christmas Eve sermon scene and a lovely feeling of warmth and happiness towards the end.

B00275EHJQ|5.0|I was a 12 when Pixar first created the computer generated, animated world of Andy's room. It was amazing, if you remember, watching the perilous journey of Buzz and Woody as they faced unspeakable dangers (including Sid's morbid in-sanitarium) as they made their way back to their bright-eyed owner, Andy. Buzz realizes that he can't fly, and Woody succumbs to the fact that Andy can have two favorite pals. Four years later, in 1999, the toys faced a new chicken suit wearing foe at Al's toy barn, and of course they succeed.<br /><br />Now, 15 years after their first adventure, our friends face their greatest opponent: An owner who has outgrown them. Andy has recently graduated from high school, and is now poised to venture into the world of college. Does he trash his toys? Or, is there a little piece of him not ready to let go? The answer may surprise you, as many things will in this latest epic from Pixar.<br /><br />I won't divulge any more plot details than I've already given you, as this is the center of the story. Toy Story 3 is a sad, inspiring piece of art from a studio we have all grown to love. I fought back the tears in \\"Up\\" and now even more so in this film. These little guys have been as much a part of my growing up as Andy. I secretly, even at the age of 12, wished that my toys came to life in my absence. Of course I knew it was impossible, but that didn't squelch the dream.<br /><br />Pixar has formulated a movie, which I would say, would ring truest to parents who have children who have, or on the verge of, leaving the nest. A moment of realization happens as Andy's mom walks into his empty room, and is stricken with the reality of her boy growing up. Maybe we feel the same about ourselves or others we have seen grow before us?<br /><br />I didn't expect this. I went into TS3 holding the usual grain of salt tucked firmly between cheek and gum, just in case I needed a good swallow, but I didn't need it. It would be easy, I guess, to detach yourself from these little guys and stand back and find a fault here and there. But frankly, I don't flipping want to.<br /><br />I am biased here, as a fan of Pixar, and as one who is attatched to the world of Andy's room. Call it what you will. In the end, I found that I too had grown up, and wondered how I had lost those innocent years as a kid building Lincoln-log forts and planning massive on-shore invasions with my plastic paratroopers. Where did it go?<br /><br />I guess, like Andy and our little friends, we face our next phases in life with renewed optimism. Tomorrow is, after all, another day.and find a fault here and there.

B0000X61VE|5.0|A friend of mine got me this DVD a very looong time ago.  I got bored one day and decided to do it.  I had been hooked from the very first workout!  I was in pain the very next day because I was so out of shape - but it was very much worth it.  I lost so much weight that friends did not recognize me.  I alternated between the 2 workouts.  Monday, I would do workout 1 - Tuesday, workout 2 - Wednesday, back to workout 1.  If I was in a mad rush and wanted to get a workout in, I'd do the 3rd workout which is the quick one.  I did stop doing the workout because life started getting hectic and I didn't have any time for the DVD.  But, I am going right back and doing it.  I am getting married in 2 months and need to get back into shape.  I have been doing an elliptical machine, but the results are not as good as this DVD.  I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend it!
1416562605|5.0|The natural adversaries of the White Tiger are not the other tigers or the sharks, hyenas and crows that the modern Indian landscape is infested with, but the tamed, albeit not tame, Roosters of Rooster Coop heritage.    It is this Rooster Coop that the author so incisively describes in this maiden work. Other works treating modern India, including those by contemporary Indian authors, have focused on social entrepreneurship, the Bottom of the Pyramid paradigm, religious conflict, rural-urban migration, caste conflict, the erosion of local languages, corruption, lack of infrastructure, terrorism, unscrupulous politicians, police brutality, inexplicable prudishness, misplaced patriotism and gender inequality; in short, on the social and economic problems and opportunities that India presents. The author acknowledges these issues and even uses them as devices within his plot. However, he chooses to go further and, bravely, attempts a psychological analysis of the main players. Or of the main player, for perhaps there is only one human type, with various psychological variants.    This epistolary novel sees the protagonist born in very downtrodden circumstances in the hinterland in India, be bereft soon of parents and school education, learn a skill, use his new found status as a driver to learn about life and the economical divide, almost be framed for homicide and almost coerced into marriage, kill his master, adopt a cousin, and become an entrepreneur, which creature he claims India does very well indeed.        \\"And our nation, though it has no drinking water, electricity, sewage system, public transportation, sense of hygiene, discipline, courtesy , or punctuality, does have entrepreneurs.\\"        There is wit, of the very dry variety, and seemingly incongruous juxtapositions that delight through their absurdity. The artist keeps critical distance from his subject and only once screams directly to the audience: \\"The book of your revolution sits in the pit of yourbelly, young Indian \\". He immediately recovers his calm and goes back to addressing the Chinese premier. The latter, if he has a sense of humour, should find this book especially entertaining and illuminative.    Is this a path-breaking work? Perhaps this is just a common novel that affords a very safe view of murky marshes, crawling with vermin and inundated with offensive smells. But it can be a turning point, for a work of art is not just an end in itself but also how it engages with and transforms the spectator. No very clear solution is offered - but only perhaps because a solution presented upon a tray would be self-defeating! The protagonist does, however, lucidly bring out the problem of the antiquated hierarchy to which many cling, believing that to stand up and stand out would be a sin against the universe and their ancestors. It is vital not to confuse this hierarchy exclusively with the traditional caste system or with a ranking according to wealth, the support of toughs, academic degree or any other material aspect: it relates to all of them and is consequently inconsistent and vague.    To restate the problem:        An ostensibly moral hierarchy permeates all social interaction in India, justifying the ill-treatment of all those beneath one, and subservience to all those above one, and enjoining upon all the necessity to stay within the structure and to police others attempting to break free.      This novel reveals this hierarchy in all its staggering ugliness. Not just the Premier of China will profit from a reading, but all those who wish to understand modern India.
1423113381|4.0|This book follows up Mr. Riordans best selling Percy Jackson series and follows it up in arard winning fasion. Not only are the two characters ,Sadie and Carter Kane, two of the most interesting I've read their different attitudes really help you see the real story. Telling it in a narrative fasion really made it easy to read and flow from page to page.     The story is about a family who hasn't been complete for some time. Carter and his dad ,Julius Kane, travel to archeological sites all throughout Egypt while his sister Sadie live with his grandparents in London. Due to his grandparents blameing his father for his mothers mysterious death 8 years earlier the grandparents were able to wrench custody from his father and effectively keep his family apart since.    Carter may be seen as a very lucky guy getting to see all of the world just at the age of 14 but he yearns for Normal school friends and staying in one place.     Sadie is just about the opposite and envys Carters time wit their father. Not only do they both think the other has what they want but there really not used to being together the two visits allowed a year really hasn't allowed them to actually consider each other to be their siblings but this book shows how they go from yearning to a normal life to seeing what they need is the family around them and exspecially each other.    Carter and Sadie find out they are both from two linked ancient familys from ancient Egypt and both are known as blood of the Pharoahs. Not only does this begin the crazy turnings in this book it gives them powers that they can only begin to comprehend with the power of ancient Egypt. Accompanied by their goddess of cats ,Bast, they travel from London to Cairo to Washington D.C. And most of the time dodgeing one bad demon or even others with their power. Not only does this keep it flowing easily but makes the ending all the more satisfying.  This is also posted on my website [...].
B003KUSUG8|4.0|The first time I listened to \\"The Eminem Show\\" in 8th grade, I was hooked. I discovered a musical wonderland with riches I didn't know existed. I placed Marshall Mathers on a pedestal, allowing my interest in him to segue into my interest in rap in general. And though I found myself content listening to Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Nas and others, I knew that nothing would capture the magic that was listening to Eminem(with the possible exception of OutKast). And now, as I found myself obsessed with hardcore and indie rock and disliking rap, I still return to Eminem, as he is a musical force that cannot be matched.  That being said, I have found myself obfuscated by \\"Relapse\\" and now \\"Recovery\\". Upon first listening to 'Relapse', I found it to be immensely entertaining. I felt like Eminem was back, with his crazy alter ego in tow and ready to slaughter the world. I have always been a bigger fan of \\"Slim Shady\\" than \\"Marshall Mathers\\", if you will, and I love when Em is at his absolute sickest. I expected the world to share my good feelings of 'Relapse', but in large part it was panned, even by Marshall himself.   And now we have 'Recovery' and I am no less confused about Eminem and my own tastes. Am I biased towards Em? Am I trying to hard to enjoy his music? I find myself unsure of Eminem's most recent albums, struggling to decide whether they are classic or merely trash-tastic. The general public seems to be in favor of Recovery, which is strange. Are these old Eminem fans or new? There's no question 'Recovery' is his most left-field work. One look at the guest appearances will verify that. It appears Marshall wants to be back in the game, and is collaborating with big names to do so. This is a whole new type of Eminem album, one that fits neatly in mainstream rap and interesting betrays Eminem's previous feelings about being part of the mainstream. I'm wondering if there's a whole new audience for Em, the type who likes his poppy side and unashamedly calls \\"Beautiful\\" their favorite song. The question here is is he desperate or just a changed man? Really, only time will tell. Is Recovery a good album? I'd be lying if I said I don't enjoy it. His raps are dizzying and I find most of the productions to be alluring, if strange for a Marshall Mathers album. The lyrical content can be mixed, some lines classic and some with rhyme schemes so simple they're cringe-worthy. It is far more personal than anything since TES, and it tones down most of the violence from the last release. But over the course of the album, he jumps from depressed to cocky to happy to jubilant to reserved to crazy to sentimental and back again. It's hard to know what to think of this album. I have no idea what its place in history will be. All I know is I still enjoy Eminem, even though the mystique of the bleached-blond demon misfit who seemed to appear from thin air is gone.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I just recently started renting gay movies online. I never have before because so many of them are just campy, soft porn or just about the same thing (guys trying to get laid). Shelter is one movie which has made me very glad I did start renting this genre. The first thing that made me interested was, of course, the main characters. (Shaun is my ideal dream man.) But, after I started watching the movie, I realized there was so much more to it than the usual hot actors. I'm usually not too impressed with the storyline in a lot of the movies I watch because so many of them are the same thing over and over. Shelter immediately drew me in and made me want to watch more. So seldom do you see any romantic movies that show such compassion, challenge, sacrifice and realistic day-to-day struggles. I couldn't help but want everything to start going well for Zach, especially after he ran into Shaun. Zach had such responsibilities and character for someone so young. His sacrificing his dream of being an artist so he could take care of his nephew really touched my heart. I could definitely relate to the difficulties he had coming out to his friends and family. The movie was well written. The chemistry was off the charts. The character development was very well done. This is a movie I would truly want my friends and family (both gay and straight) to watch. It was a movie that left me with that happy lumpy feeling in my chest and the sparkle of happy tears in my eyes. It will definitely be in my \\"Favorites\\" section of my movies.

B001HN694K|1.0|When i first heard that tim burton was directing allice and wonderland i thought. i thought wow after seeing what he did in Batman Returns that Alice in Wonderland was going to spill over with surreal visuals, beautiful scenes and weird characters,all spawned from burton's wildly creative imagination.  But instead it was boring, a movie that seemed drab even for Burton, every scene seemed like it was covered in dirt. and I could not picture any child sitting through this without losing intrest in the first 15 minutes Big Disappointment from one of my favorite directors.  definatly a waste of talent and money. My guess is burton did'nt get the budget he wanted from Disney and fudged this one. it should be swept under the rug and forgotten. dont even waste your money buying it on Blu Ray  unlike Avatar there nothing to see here.

I love all versions of Cyndi....I love Pop Cyndi, I love Disco Cyndi, I love Acoustic Cyndi, and now I love Blues Cyndi.   This is a must have for any fan of Cyndi or Blues music.
0756405890|4.0|\\"The Name of the Wind\\"  by Patrick Rothfuss    Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent book, but the writer at his current rate of productivity will never release the sequel.  And that's with it having been written at the same time as this book.  Seems it was too large and split into three volumes.  Then the author is in \\"major\\" rewrite/editing mode or as I like to put it \\"scared to release\\" mode.  That or he got some financial stability and sees no reason to release it.    Been what?  3 years now with no publication date in sight.  I used to think Robert Jordon had release issue but this guy has him beat.  One volume and years for the followup.    My recommendation?  Wait for all three volumes to be released before starting.  Odds are either you or the author will die first from old age.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|As a long-standing fan of Eminem's, I have seen him transform as an artist from CD to CD. I've witnessed his youthful drug-induced psychopath days, and his distraught divorcee/single father agony - and everything in between. Each album seems to take on a different theme, and Recovery follows suit. Eminem is trying to convey his stress with loosing hid close friend Proof, his status as a relevant rapper in the hip-hop game waning, and his constant bout with depression and the resulting dependency on drugs that has stemmed from it. All that said, Recovery does a great job at telling this story. The story lacks as much depth as we've seen in previous albums. The tracks on The Eminem Show made us FEEL like we were right next to Em through his gun fights and court cases. Recovery draws a picture of Eminem's problems that are much vaguer. Regardless, Eminem does an incredible job at putting all these thoughts together to deliver the best lyrics an MC can come up with. And he draws in the aid of today's to artists to make our heads nod even harder. The songs with P!nk, Lil' Wayne, and Rihanna are all solid gold, and at the end, Eminem wraps it all up to show us that he's still capable of putting on a fantastic show. The golden egg for me lies in Track #17, a hidden track that lays to rest and doubt that Eminem is unquestionably one f the greatest rappers to ever live. (Truth be told, Track 17 alone was well worth the price of the entire CD.)
081297381X|3.0|So the books theme is the occurrence of A \\"Black Swan\\" event.  The Black Swan is a metaphor for an event which before occurring is not forecasted, anticipated-or even deemed possible.  Howver, After it occurs it is quite easy to see the actions occurring before the events were good indicators of the impending event.  The reader is led down a path to accept these events will happen and attempt to factor this reality into planning.    From my perspective the author raises good points and gets one to think about mitigating strategies.  Howver, this is the classic article stretched into a book situation.  Too much time is spent reinforcing the metaphor described in the previous paragraph-such that the later chapters are a chore to get through.  I loved the author's first book \\"Fooled by Randomness\\"- I would direct the reader in that direction.
1427944024|5.0|I enjoyed the story and subject matter of the book which gets into the science of nanotechnology, information technology, biology, and corporate life.  I read this book only in 3 brief sittings which is fast for me.
1400052173|4.0|I really liked this book.  It is fascinating to read the back-story about scientific accomplishments and learn of the real people that made it all possible.  That being said, I am going to be a bit of a contrarian about the controversy.  The fact that I am inspired to take a position on this at all is a tribute to the author since she motivated me to have an opinion!  I can empathize with the doctors stating that \\"informed consent\\" as the extremes of that goes would be problematic with scientific use of tissues.  How can one give consent to things that aren't even imagined yet?  When do we get over our \\"me, me, me\\" mentality to realize that sometimes it is just expected that if you are to benefit from the accumulated knowledge of medicine that your case will be used to increase that knowledge?<br /><br />Deborah was a very sympathetic character.  I cried when she died. But the brothers? Ugh.  They were gold-digging for something that literally was no skin off their nose.  Opportunistic.  And it made me ill.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|I was horrified for a week after seeing this movie. Who ever thought of this movie has a sick sick mind! it was one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen.

0525423842|3.0|I have been a school library/media specialist for decades and thought I would have some excellent summer reading with John Grisham leading the list.  OOPS!  While Grisham understands the law and the workings of the court, he apparently doesn't understand what the YA crowd likes.  My high school students gobble up his adult thrillers as fast as I can get them ready for the shelf.  My middle schoolers will reach for this book because of the author's reputation.  Unfortunately they will be disappointed.  My concern is will they remember the name of the author and not pick up the great adult novels he has written?  Do I include it in my middle school colletion or not?    I found that I was waiting for Theodore Boone to be as clever and as engaging as Mark Sway (The Client).  It didn't happen.  Theodore comes across as a know-it-all to the kids who ask for legal advice and the lawyer-turned-teacher who lets Theodore teach his class about courtroom procedure.  I found him a character for pity as his closest confidants where his parents and an uncle.    There was a menacing character who only looked at Theodore and never verbally or physically interacts with Theodore.  I found that strange, especially at the end.  We are expected The Look he gives Theodore to be all?      The thud you hear at the end is the back cover being closed in disappointment.
0670021652|3.0|I enjoyed this book because I did not expect it to be  Eat Pray Love. I read it for its own merits. However,  I found the last few pages just unbeleviably   stupid and over the top. When the mayor shows up  to perform Felipe and Elizabeth's thrown together last minute wedding,   the author stoops to the absurd notion of calling it off and hesitating  due to the fact that he is a Republican mayor. Oh! The horror...  the horror. So..once again..we have an author trading in petty partisan politics for the sake of being oh so politically correct. Sorry, you just demeaned your literary effort!

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I have \\"I Am\\" from Nas and really liked that, like Eminem as well, and listened to a lot of hip hop in the late 90's but haven't listened to a lot of the new hip hop scene. Saw the reviews on this and picked it up on a whim. Love it! Every song is solid.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|Chicken Little is an unexpected blend of classic children's story, underdog fervor, and science fiction. Chicken Little makes \\"one little slip\\" (a great tune in the movie by a popular music group) which sets off an avalanche of mishaps. How can he convince everyone that a piece of the sky shaped like a stop sign really fell from the sky and hit him on the head? After a second piece falls through his bedroom window and again konks him on the forehead, he and his devoted friends, Abby the ugly duckling, Fish out of water, and Runt of the litter try to figure out the cause of this strange phenomenon.<br /><br />There is a lot of exaggerated truth in this movie which is very funny. Don Knotts is the political figure Mayor Turkey Lurkey who checks with his advisors before he expresses an opinion and the main characters are endearing. I catch myself singing the songs too.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this product not expecting much - just a home workout for those days I cannot hit the gym... What a great surprise!  This DVD is just great!  The structure of the program makes it very, very effective - I workout regularly, but this video seemed to do more in 20 minutes than my 80 minutes at the gym!  I was sore all over the next day, but I am pressing on!  I already feel stronger! The fact that it is only 20 minutes makes it easy to fit the workout in my schedule - specially on those crazy days... It is very, very intense, so DO start with phase 1.... much harder than what I thought, but doable - the 30 second blocks of exercise allow me to complete each portion, even though it's very challenging!  I got bored with the music / sound by the 3rd day, so I turned the volume down and put my own music on (Duran Duran, George Michael, .,,) !  It was fun!   If you're in doubt, just get it - well worth your investment, and it will motivate you to get fit - just 20 minutes a day, there are no excuses!
B000EQ5SRK|5.0|I saw this movie when I was in High School.  This movie can put one in a freaky mood during this movie. The music, the kissing, etc can make one very excited. That's all I will say. This movie is not for the prude.

B002MBAJ4M|5.0|Gov't Mule does not disappoint with this classic release.  Warren Haynes wields the axe with the greatest of all time.  Add to his impressive guitar skills the soulful lyrics of a southern bluesman who seems to have loved and lost with the best of them, and you have a unique throwback to the mid-70's work of such greats as his own bandleader Gregg Allman, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Marshall Tucker Band.  But Gov't Mule takes it a step further by giving it a metal edge while maintaining the free will to jam out.  By A Thread is easily one of their best albums, up there with High & Mighty and Deja Voodoo, classics of the singular world of Southern Rock Jam that Gov't Mule resides in with contemporaries Derek Trucks and My Morning Jacket merely renting space.  When Warren Haynes comes on stage, he's not there out of the band's generous spirit, he's there because he's your daddy.  Warren lays down a guitar lick better than anybody out there, and he shows it on a number of tracks, here are my favorite cuts:    1.  Broke Down On The Brazos:  Heavy bassline starts the album off with a thunderous lament:  \\"Broke down on the brazos, about to lose my mind.\\"    2.  Steppin' Lightly:  Playful chord progression with a catchy chorus:  \\"One of these days...I'm going to get better.\\" - will have you singing along long after the song has finished.    4.  Monday Mourning Meltdown:  \\"If a tear falls in the ocean, does it make a sound?\\" - a prophetic lyric seemingly predicting the BP spill.  On this track, Haynes refuses to let Bush slide into the past, still questioning his political ascent.  MMM is a gorgeous track railing the previous administration's actions:  \\"What about all the blood on the battleground?\\"    7.  Frozen Fear:  A softer track, Warren lets the target of his poetry know that she is not alone:  \\"Loneliness is just frozen fear.\\"    8.  Forevermore:  The second in a succession of softer tracks.  Another song you will be singing long after it's finished, \\"Can't you see?  My whole world is nothing without you.\\"  Warren bares his soul on this track.    9.  Inside Outside Woman Blues #3:  Now this is a classic track worthy of Jimi Hendrix.  Warren lays down some fat licks while describing the difference between the 'inside woman' and 'outside woman'.  \\"Inside woman drive you out your mind; Outside woman ready anytime\\".  This is another gorgeous song with some heavy blues guitar.    10.  Scenes From A Troubled Mind:  A nicely-paced song arranged to jam on, it ends with a jam session.  \\"Thunder, thunder, please bring the rain, wash away these lies.  Scenes from a troubled mind.\\"
B0012GMX2Y|5.0|This is arguably Gentle Giant's best album, and the one I'd play for a GG newbie to help them \\"acquire the taste\\" (my girlfriend isn't quite there yet but getting closer).  Musically complex, dynamic and full of delicious hooks as most GG albums are, yet beautifully simple in its construction, Three Friends should be regarded as a classical symphony as well as an outstanding prog-rock performance to be fully appreciated. I'd love to hear it with the backing of a full horn section and a symphony orchestra. A masterpiece from a band that expanded the language of rock music like no other.
B002T921AC|4.0|I really like Justin Bieber's voice. I think he sings well and has a good tonal quality.  I like the first and last song on this album best of all.  He has a lot of potential as an entertainer, musician and teen idol.

B003KAPVS8|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but after just three episodes I'm really enjoying this new season of Dr. Who.  So far Matt Smith's Doctor seems to be continuing along the path Tennant started down while adding his own twists to the character.  As for the new companion combine Rose and Donna into a hot young Scottish redhead and you've got  Amy Pond.  Throw in a revamped Tardis, new SFX, and a new generation of Daleks and I'd say we're off to a great start.  Although I'd be willing to bet the Fanboys will find something to whine about.
B002ZG97RY|4.0|Don't let some critics fool you, Green Zone is one of the MOST American films you'll see. I'm glad I live in a country where we can question our government without being punished or killed. In fact, we don't use that particular freedom quite enough.<br /><br />Green Zone walks a tricky line. It attempts to veil a fictional action movie over a very touchy event. That event is the invasion of Iraq and specifically the reason for invasion. We were told there were WMD's in Iraq. I personally feel we were told this in a way that struck fear in our country. When we invaded there were none to be found. Now, feel free to argue that point, but it's a fact. Were there other weapons there that cause destruction of some kind? I'm sure there were. That's to be expected. Citizen's of America, however, were led to believe there were weapons there that could cause destruction on the scale of nuclear or biochemical. Those weren't found. Now, from here on out, one has to be careful. There is nothing more being asserted. There is no argument that Saddam Hussein isn't evil, no argument that Iraq never had WMD's or possibly moved them before the invasion, no argument against the horrible things that were going on in Iraq. All we ask as citizens of this great country is that when our government goes to war and puts our youth in danger, they better tell the truth about why they're doing it. Politically speaking, that is what Green Zone is trying to say. It portrays the anger many people feel about being misled. If you think that is anti-american then I have to question your definition of American. To blindly follow your country is one of the most anti-american things I can think of. The film makes other comments on missteps during the invasion, such as dismissing the Iraqi army and leaving them unemployed and agitated, and I can go on to talk about them but I'm here to critique a film.<br /><br />If you liked any of Paul Greengrass' previous films, especially the Bourne sequels, I see no reason why you wouldn't thoroughly enjoy Green Zone. It is taut, exciting and kept me engaged and guessing all the way until the end. Greengrass employs the same shaky hand-held camera work that he always has and in a film set amongst the confusion of war it has never been more effective.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of Green Zone is the subplot of Freddy. Freddy is an Iraqi citizen who approaches Miller and his unit (while they are at another site containing no WMD's) with information about a meeting occurring of suspected high priority targets. After the invasion of the meeting, and the discovery that Hussein's top ranking general was there, the film's spider web cover-up plot takes off as Miller slowly peels back the layers of what's really going on. What is so interesting about Freddy is that he personifies the complications of the occupation. He also has one of the most powerful lines of the film. Miller continually states how he is there to do his job; find WMD's and save lives, but Freddy is there to remind him (and us) that it is a little more complicated than that.<br /><br />The story line of Green Zone has many ins and outs. In other hands the film could have become confusing and irritating but the story is told with great ease by director Paul Greengrass and writer Brian Helgeland. One way to do this, which has been portrayed as a negative by many critics, is one dimensional characters and simple yet powerful dialogue. That way, there is less to get in the way. Let me be clear though, the characters are in no way dull, boring or poorly written. I think a better way to describe them, and the film as a whole, is focused.<br /><br />I think in order to enjoy this film, you really have to go into it with an open mind. I say that to both sides of the argument. If you completely disagree with my second paragraph above, you could still enjoy the film as it is a thriller, not a documentary. Even if you agree with the assertions of the film, you also have to realize that it is a work of fiction and not something to use to further your contentions. Bottom line: Green Zone is a very effective thriller that was a blast to watch.<br /><br />See my movie review blog, [...], for more reviews.n and not something to use to further your contentions.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|This camera backpack can easily hold 2 full-size DSLR cameras and a few extra lenses, or even some point & shoot cameras all in the same case.  A mini tripod will definitely fit inside, not sure about a full-size tripod since I don't own one (if they fold up you may be able to).  Whatever you want this case to be for your particular needs, it can morph into it.<br /><br />The main section of the backpack is configured into 9 separate compartments.  However these compartments (slightly padded BTW) are fastened with Velcro, so you can configure the interior of the backpack into anything that you would need it for.  You can even remove all the compartments if you want and use it as a regular backpack.  Inside the \\"lid\\" are two separate see-though plastic zippered compartments as well.<br /><br />As far as the exterior of the backpack, each side as two Velcro-closure pockets with flaps, which measure approx. 4.5\\" by 4\\" wide.  The outside top (lid) has 2 huge zippered pockets, there is TONS of storage areas with this case/backpack.<br /><br />The underneath part of the backpack which would come in contact with your back is made of mesh to keep you a little cooler while hauling it around.  The straps are lightly padded and adjustable.  It was comfortable for me (I am 5' 4\\"), but I doubt if it would fit well for anyone over 200 lbs.<br /><br />As a whole, the backpack is lightly padded with a somewhat soft tricot lining. The exterior is nylon and is easily cleaned with a wet cloth.  There is a handle on top if you don't want to use carry it as a backpack, which I do, since I don't think backpacks are all that comfortable no matter how padded the straps are.

0307454541|5.0|It is immediately obvious why The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is such a popular book.  From the very first line, Steig Larson draws the reader into the mystery of his novel, and it is thereafter always difficult to stop reading.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that it takes place in Sweden, as I have never read anything set in that country before.  Hardly one of the usual exotic settings for a thriller, but completely unique, and definitely part of what sets this novel apart from the others in its genre.  It is however, quite clearly a thriller, full of suspense, characters who deal with situations independently from the normal police presence that might be expected, without actually being vigilantes.<br /><br />The main characters of this novel are as interesting as the events, especially together.  First, there is an independent middle-aged journalist who has stumbled upon a story that bites back.  The title character, the girl with the dragon tattoo, is a troubled young woman with a flair for punk clothing.  She works as a personal investigator, and the unlikely story of how she teams up with the journalist is half the story of this book.  The other half is obviously what they are both investigating.  That part is what becomes increasingly immediate as the novel progresses, keeping readers turning the pages long into the night.<br /><br />This is definitely an adult novel, with some very unpleasant situations described in it.  I would warn high school readers that the title is not meant to indicate some kind of fantasy content, nor is the punk character a teen, with high school concerns in her life.  That being said, I would certainly recommend this book to anybody.  I have the soft cover, actually, and it is very nicely made, with one of those spines that doesn't have to be broken for the book to open all the way.  Also, I really only knew that this was translated because it said so on the info pages, as the translation was very well done, and kept enough of the Swedish lingo and phrases to retain local flavor, without being confusing.and phrases to retain local flavor, without being confusing.

That's just... ridiculous, not to mention internally inconsistent with the Lost mythology which had been slowly building since the original episode.<br /><br />Just thinking about the Lost series as a whole makes me feel angry.

B001DSNF8C|5.0|Movie - 5.0    Growing up I was a casual Bond fan, maybe a little more than casual, but not quite die-hard. I appreciated the franchise for its style, sleek atmosphere, British charm, and sex appeal with all those girls. Somewhere down the line my tastes developed into something a little beyond the flash and pizazz that I started to grow weary of. And by the time Pierce Brosnan starred in his final film as Agent 007, I'm afraid to say I was starting to lose interest in the same old formula and presentation. Then came Bond 21, Casino Royale, starring a complete newcomer I'd never even heard of in Daniel Craig. Suffice it to say, Casino Royale is a much needed reboot of the classic character. Not only is there a new actor, but also a new tone that completely rejuvenates the franchise from square one. Here we see Craig portraying Bond as a rookie hotshot who's just earned his Double-O status. He's young, brash, full of energy, and borderline uncontrollable acting on impulse and emotion, though with just enough of that cool, collected debonair most of us are probably accustomed to seeing. However, as many young and overconfident hotshots often realize soon after, there needs to be a lesson of moderation learned. Enter Vesper Lynd who allows us to see a side of Bond that is so much more down-to-earth and actually humanized that one would never have thought possible. But with this being Bond, we certainly can't expect such a happy ending. Soon after their relationship really starts to blossom betrayal ensues and Bond is livid to conclude things the only way he knows best -- with cold, brutal efficiency. To be continued in Quantum of Solace. To really appreciate these movies for their writing I recommend you watch both, not as a movie and its sequel, but two parts of one long and personal narrative. I don't want to spoil the journey Bond makes between here and there, but read both reviews and you'll understand.    Video - 4.5    From the black and white flashback to the African Rundown to the lush and beautiful landscapes of the Bahamas, Italy, etc., every single frame is full of depth and color vibrancy. Skin textures are very fine and especially detailed with just enough film grain to give it that gritty, atmospheric feel reflected in the films' writing. Contrast and black levels are strong as well during the night and dimly-lit scenes. My favorite shots are from the poker game. Not only is there a great degree of sharpness to the face shots of the players, but the poker chips and various colors of tables, clothes, and drinks really stand out, only adding that Bond-level of material extravagance to the film's overall temperament. While not the most exciting reference scene I would recommend, it's certainly a very good part to watch, though you could easily use any of the overview shots of landscapes or grandiose action sequences as well. On the downside, I did notice a few minor instances of artifacts and debris, especially in the scene where Bond is talking to M in the Bahamas where this inexplicably large speck flashes on the screen, but other than that, everything else looks relatively flawless.    Audio - 5.0    To this date, Casino Royale remains atop my \\"loudest movies\\" list up there with Hellboy II, Fight Club, and The Bourne Ultimatum. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track here is as amazing as the video transfer. From the very get-go in the opening flashback scene we're surrounded in this pool of sound filled with tough, gut-thumping effects and immersed in a masterful soundtrack by David Arnold. I wanna' say that in addition to the very active sound field, I'm especially enamored with how well the music is separated and integrated evenly through each speaker. With that said, directionality and dynamics are exuberantly punctuated when the more hellish scenes with gunfire and crashing objects are on screen. LFEs, particularly through the music, will rock your room, if not your house. Explosions, crumbling environments, and all the sort have a great depth of bass. Dialogue (a large majority of the film) is crisp with no disparities at any point in the film, making for yet another title of reference quality. No-brainer demo material would be either the African Rundown at the beginning of the movie or the Collapsing Palazzo at the end.    Extras - 5.0    Owning the initial release from '07, I gladly double-dipped for this Collector's Edition when hearing there would be a separate BD containing many new special features. Of most interest were the vignettes talking about the history and stigma that were carried by this particular novel, how the rights remained in limbo for so long, and how it all came about in the first place up to where the idea of the movie was reconceived as the new starting point for the franchise. I have to say, I was amazed at just how complicated the entire ordeal turned out. In addition, there are also many, many other features that cover production design, shooting logistics, cast and crew interviews, and a somewhat brief look back on the iconography of Bond up to this newest installment. Time-wise, I'm pretty sure there are at least three plus hours of Extras between the new and old stuff from the previous release, of which most are in HD. Of course, most of this material is covered in the equally informative commentary if you don't mind watching the movie again. Big thanks to Sony for giving this fine film the set of extras it deserves.    Overall - 5.0    So yeah, Bond was starting to become stagnant around the end of the Brosnan era for me. And of all the novels to be filmed, the very first, albeit troubled, one in Casino Royale was picked. Not only did it revitalize the franchise by taking things back to basics and creating a darker, grittier atmosphere, but it did so in such stunning fashion thanks in huge part to the superb effort given by Daniel Craig and veteran Bond director Martin Campbell. A wonderfully written, photographed, and coordinated film, Casino Royale along with its direct sequel Quantum of Solace, which for all intents and purposes is just the third act of a very long film (again, read the review for my interpretation), are currently my top action/drama/spy/thriller titles of all-time. Presented with reference A/V specs by Sony and a long-awaited, very thorough, package of special features, this Collector's Edition is a must own piece of film-making for any Bond fan or movie aficionado alike.

B002ONC9NM|4.0|Movie - 4.5    Every now and then, I'm sure people find a movie that manages to fly under the radar and gets a lot less credit than it deserves, or in layman's terms, \\"a diamond in the rough.\\" I discovered such a gem when deciding to give An Education a rent based solely on the one time I saw a trailer for it on another Sony BD. Aside from the presence of the always-proficient class act, Alfred Molina, nothing else at the time really struck me as \\"wow, I have to see this.\\" I knew the movie would be a British-produced, coming of age, slice-of-life, semi-period piece about a girl, but that's it. Thankfully, the film itself easily defied a lot of the preconceived notions I had going in. An Education is a quaint, yet brilliantly written and directed story not just about a girl becoming a woman, but about the naivety, discovery, and eventual hardship I think all people are likely to feel and experience at some point in their lives. The script has a lot of charm and subtlety to it, which is wonderfully delivered and acted by (newcomers, to me) Carey Mulligan, Peter Sarsgaard, and for what few moments she has, Olivia Williams. The entire production actually reminds me of a lower-budgeted work that somehow just happened to be a really good thing in the end. It's neither flashy, nor does it feel like an exuberant amount of money went into any particular shot. But for some reason, it just works and feels like grade-A film-making. I know Mulligan was nominated for Best Actress, and while I've yet to see Sandra Bullock in The Blind Side, I would definitely vouch for Ms. Mulligan's fine performance, here. For those curious to check this movie out, I would say go in with the expectations of a low-key romantic drama. But at the same time, put yourself in Mulligan's shoes at that age and ask yourself what you think you'd do if you were her. It may sound a bit far-fetched, maybe even juvenile if you're not in to this genre, but I certainly feel a little more educated after watchingit.    Video - 4.0    As I mentioned about the non-flashy presentation of the film itself, An Education looks pretty good given the period it was set in, the conservative nature of that time, and the fact that this isn''t some high-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Colors for a majority of the film range somewhere between drab and \\"one shiny moment\\" where Mulligan wears a particularly extravagant dress. Vibrancy isn't a strong point of the art direction, but I actually think it compliments the film's thematic progression very well. Skin tones are accurate, if not a tad pale, but brighten and fill up a bit when the main characters get into the night clubs and visit Paris. Contrast and black levels are adequate throughout revealing a good amount of object detail and facial features as well, with a little noise here and there during the more darkly-lit scenes, but overall never feels distracting. It's a video transfer that accurately showcases the film's artistic attributes and is another great job by Sony.    Audio - 4.5    Much more pleasing in presentation is the DTS-HD 5.1 track. Dialogue is clear and unfaltering through the center channel, with a decent amount of sound effects for cars, doors, and footsteps kept mainly on the front sides. High and low ends are handled as best as they can be for the limited sound design, with separation being good enough and directionality sparse. I thought it was going to be a front-heavy track initially, but music immersion is where the audio really shines. Throughout the film, we're treated to various instances of period jazz, big band, and swing music that have a tremendous amount of buoyancy outputting from all the speakers. And the fact that it even emanates some subtle LFEs only makes it more fun to listen to. The score by Paul Englishby has a good pace to it and never feels too melodramatic or overdone in any way. All in all, the music department did a great job making up for what the sound effects department lacked in presence.    Extras - 2.0    Aside from the somewhat jovial commentary with director Scherfig and actors Mulligan and Sarsgaard, there's not much else in terms of special features. The commentary itself dibbles and dabbles at the technical processes of the filming, the acting, and alterations made between filming and the final product, but never really gets too focused. It makes for a good listen, but is probably not something I'd say has a lot of replay value. In addition, there are also a couple of paltry vignettes featuring the making-of and red carpet arrival, though they do very little for me that isn't either covered in the commentary or that I can deduce on my own. However, given the low-key marketing the film itself received, the studio probably felt it would be in the company's best interest to keep the extras at a minimum, which is too bad. There also deleted scenes and Sony trailers.    Overall - 4.0    This movie really caught me by surprise. I only saw the trailer once and had very little expectations going in. Thankfully, it surprised the heck out of me with how well-written and directed it was. My biggest surprise, however, was the discovery of Carey Mulligan. She has a very subtle appearance, but a very strong screen presence. I'm hoping this film will open a lot of doors for her in the future. Presented by Sony with excellent A/V specs, though a disappointing set of extras, An Education comes highly recommended for movie-goers wanting an engaging character drama.
081297381X|2.0|Book is not readable. Much too repetitive, self indulgent and incoherent. Author may be an expert in his field but does not know how to keep a reader interseted (too many references to past or future chapters). Author also comes across as a rebel without a cause,trashing conventional wisdom bit too much.     Not sure who the book is for. For Non technical audiance he does not make it interesting enough for them to continue reading (he actually somwehere in the book looks down on idea of catering to anyone and a story telling way of explaining a complex phenomenon). Technical audiance who know about probablity,statistics and bell curve, also know of their limitations; when it applies and where it does not. To deny its utility and practical use by calling it great intellectual fraud is pushing it.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Movie - 5.0    When I first saw Quantum of Solace in theaters I was actually very disappointed by this second installment of the Craig-era. Of course, it had been several months since I'd seen Casino Royale, so I kept in mind, \\"maybe I should watch them back-to-back next time?\\" Thankfully, my inclination was correct.  I can't stress enough that if you're any kind of Casino Royale fan you should watch these two films back-to-back, not as two separate films, but as one really long character exposition and personal narrative for one James Bond. Casino Royale introduced this new version of Bond, showed us who he was, continued to build him from the ground up as a real person, and ultimately tore him down inducing a vengeful mean streak, a la John W. Creasy, Jason Bourne, Bryan Mills, or whichever cold and angry butt-kicking espionage character you can think of. However, what I think throws a lot people off is the film's allegory. Director Marc Forster (whom I really respect for his work in Stranger than Fiction) does a spectacular job taking over for Martin Campbell managing to capture the dark and gritty resonance of Royale's final events and carrying them over to Quantum for a very fine piece of storytelling. It's like Royale in that it strays from the old \\"flashy\\" Bond many might be used to or were expecting again, but I particularly enjoyed the cerebral approach and amount of symbolism shown here. Through the side-story of this film's supporting character (played admirably by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko), we're given a complimenting revenge tale that ultimately carries itself out by the end of the movie.  However, there's a lesson to be learned that only further progresses Bond's character.  And that is the lesson of forgiveness; forgiveness to himself and Vesper to achieve peace, and the achievement of peace to find solace.  Hence the title of the movie: Quantum (the organization he seeks) of Solace (the eventual state of being he finds after chasing Quantum down). In turn, this will balance out the brash rebelliousness we saw in Royale, and probably lean him towards the eventual \\"balanced\\" Bond we've grown accustomed to in the movies of old.    Video - 5.0    The video presentation for Quantum is stellar.  Right from the very beginning when Bond is being chased down the highways of Italy we're presented with a pristine picture.  Flesh tones are bold, and colors are vibrant from the paint of his Aston Martin down to the dirt on his face.  Contrast and black levels are flawless providing for an extremely life-like appearance and in-depth high definition display. There are so many instances of reference video, you could probably choose any scene you want as showcase material. I personally would go with either the opening chase sequence or the final battle at the desert hotel. The opening sequence has a lot of debris (as in rocks, dirt, etc., not actual film artifacting) flying around and you can see every little detail, even with dust kicking up. The desert hotel has a big fire break out, but I choose this scene because object and texture detail is amazingly sharp even within the flames and smoke. Rest assured, this is visually the best-looking Bond film to date.    Audio - 5.0    Equally awe-inspiring is the DTS-HD 5.1 track. Again, right from the very beginning we get all sorts of demo-worthy material to display the greatness of lossless audio. The enthralling musical score by David Arnold, the revving of Bond's Aston Martin, the gunshots of his pursuers, and the crashing of cars along the highway make for a great aural experience. Separation and directionality are especially proficient with sound effects traveling in all sorts of directions, mixing perfectly with the music, and never suffering from dropout or volume loss. Dynamics are also spot-on from a drop of water or foot on gravel to the booming echo of an explosion. Dialogue, of course, is clear and steady staying right on the center channel. And LFEs, while not too frequent, provide some healthy doses of thud and thump. If I had to sum up the audio presentation of this film in two words they'd be \\"quintessentially crisp.\\" Don't be afraid to show this off to your friends again and again.    Extras - 2.5    The only true disappointment with this BD is the sparse amount of extra features. It's nice that what little we get is presented in HD, but it's much too broad leaving way more to be desired. We get some very brief glimpses and interviews with the director, cast, and crew. Although, if you add up the total run time and take into account how much it repeats itself, it really isn't a large amount at all. There's no audio commentary for the film itself, no in-depth character analysis or writing workshops, nothing. Chances are if this release goes anything like Casino Royale we're probably looking at a double dip collector's edition before the next installment of the Craig-era comes out. But that's okay, I don't mind. As great a work of art as this movie is, I'd gladly be willing to pay for some more extensive features.    Overall - 4.5    Fans of this film will more than likely agree that it's somewhat of an underrated title. After all, it's the first true sequel of a Bond movie, which may or may not connect to audiences long-removed from Casino Royale. This is why I highly recommend that when you sit down to view this make sure you either watch Royale prior to, or at least have a good memory of what happened. Because despite the quick-cutting and fast-moving pace of this film, there's actually quite a bit to be enjoyed if you pay close enough attention. With reference A/V presentation, though an excruciatingly short and truncated set of extras, Quantum of Solace comes highly recommended for action/thriller fans, but especially so for fans of the Bond franchise.
B003OCWF6I|4.0|In 2010 a crack Special Forces unit was betrayed by their government and set up for a mass murder they didn't commit.  These men promptly (?) escaped their explosive assassination attempt to the Bolivian underground.  Today, still wanted by the CIA and an evil villain named Max, they survive in order to seek revenge and reclaim their lives.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, it's too bad; because a mysterious woman has already hooked them up with their ultimate revenge mission, and you CANNOT hire The Losers.<br /><br />Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  It should; it's very close to the A-Team intro (which is a GOOD thing).  The similarities don't end there, as both are a group of former soldiers led by a charismatic figure with an affinity for unwinnable situations, cool behavior, celebratory smoking.  Each team has a lady's man, with the leader being both in The Losers.  Each team engages in high firepower, explosive situations that involved meticulously planned tactics requiring a peculiar amount of fortune.<br /><br />The teams differ, however, in their configuration and purpose.  Whereas the A-Team had a lady's man who appeared to be just that, and a leader who appeared to only lead; that is to say, he managed multiple oddball personalities, The Losers shows each person as an integral part of the team, a specialist in his own field.  This was a positive spin on the \\"mercenary group battles the world\\"-motif.  Additionally, the Loser's \\"employer\\" is given with a bit more purpose and underlying story, as mysterious Aisha funds and organizes their mission while maintaining her own agenda.<br /><br />This is a hands-off, good time movie.  Explosions, military action, high-tech gadgets, a fairly hot hookup between the film's leads, and fairly awesome special effects make it fun throughout.  Add in a fiery male-female fight scene (ala Mr. and Mrs. Smith), a comically evil villain in Jason Patric (DO NOT drop his umbrella!), a Spanish Justin Long (&Oacute;scar Jaenada), quippy one-liners, and a very short runtime (97 minutes), and the result is an underrated comic book adaptation that entertains yet gets unfairly overlooked.<br /><br />Jason Elinenada), quippy one-liners, and a very short runtime (97 minutes), and the result is an underrated comic book adaptation that entertains yet gets unfairly overlooked.

B0035WTJFW|5.0|Movie - 4.5    Having just seen this movie for the first time at the time of writing this, I'm amazed and shocked.  Amazed at how great a film this is, and shocked at why I never bothered to watch it until now. Steven Spielberg has long been a favorite of mine when it comes to directors, and I always thought Tom Cruise wasn't too bad an actor himself. But with that said, Minority Report is an excellent piece of science fiction that works on a number of levels. For me personally, I enjoyed a lot of the film's moral and philosophical quandaries about science in general, its eventual over-dependence by society, the analogies between it and religion, the flaws and doubt of systemization (particularly in law enforcement), and finally, the gravity of our choices and how they can affect the future. Spielberg does a tremendous job weaving all of these issues into a deep enough narrative that gets you thinking, but also manages to entertain, as seen by some of the very sleek action sequences and visual effects. I also enjoyed a great deal of the screenplay and how it dispersed just the right amounts of action, adventure, drama, mystery, and thriller, never faltering and building up to a very satisfying last act. If anything, I just wish the movie were longer and a little more focused on any of the story elements mentioned above as opposed to all of them at an equally sparse level. Regardless, though, it's an excellent movie crafted by one of the best in the business and well-acted by a great group of core actors in Cruise, Farrell, von Sydow, and even Peter Stormare with his brief appearance. Minority Report is a film that, like a lot of science fiction, has more questions than answers, but with a cool and stylish kind of gritty sheen that will probably satisfy serious and popcorn audiences alike.    Video - 5.0    This HD master is Spielberg-approved, so who am I to argue? Minority Report is presented by Paramount in absolute pristine fashion. From the very beginning of thefilm to its end Janusz Kaminski's dark, yet gorgeous cinematography his preserved to perfection. Colors aren't quite as vibrant in conjunction to the film's drab art direction, but I feel they're very representative of the story's nature. Sharpness and image detail also look quite good with a great deal of dimensionality and depth between the actors, visual, and CG effects. But the biggest positives are in the black levels and contrast. Blacks are extremely deep with fine detail between lines and shadows, never losing consistency or getting lost within the photography, thanks in large part to the complimenting contrast. Skin textures, objects, and backgrounds are as good as they'll ever look outside of 3D or holograms. There's also a fine layer of grain providing for a very commendable theatrical look as well, which in some cases reveals some tiny, tiny instances of artifacting and debris, but if you're not even looking for them, it's certainly nothing to complain about. Other than that, there don't seem to be any signs of image enhancement or manipulation whatsoever.    Audio - 5.0    Equally matching its video is a reference-quality DTS-HD 5.1 track. I actually hadn't seen a Spielberg movie on BD until Minority Report, so I was pleasantly surprised at what I heard. The first thing that struck me was John Williams' score (another BD audio-first) and it's subtle, yet immersive presence. It does a good job setting the pace and mood for the film and gives off some excellent fidelity for heavy string and percussion instruments in particular. Dialogue is always clear and understandable from the center channel as well and never suffers from dropout or distortion. In terms of effects, the sound design stays mostly quiet, as a lot of the movie is dialogue. But being the master film-maker Spielberg is, what action and chase sequences he does use manage to really give the sound system a workout. High and low ends for all the technology usage are pitch-perfect, directionality and separation are tight and discernible from one another, and LFEs, while not too frequent, really give the room a pleasant rumble when present. My favorite bit of sound display you could probably use for showcasing would be the Car Factory chase. It represents a little bit of everything from music to sound effects placement to a very cool bass effect in the Sonic Gun he uses to take down some of his pursuers.    Extras - 4.5    Minority Report comes packed with a lot of the special features from the DVD release as well as some exclusive material in HD to compliment this newly minted BD release. Amounting to almost three hours worth of information, I learned quite a bit from these extras and found it fascinating just how much work went into all the production aspects. Everything from casting and writing, set and prop design, special and visual effects, sound design, music composition, and cinematography are covered to great length. In particular, I really enjoyed the Phillip K. Dick segment and a lot of the comments from cast and crew about the film's production and adaptation. Although, I am a bit disappointed that the film itself doesn't have any kind of audio or P-i-P commentary from Spielberg. But with that said, the extras still offer quite a bit of food for thought.    Overall - 5.0    Minority Report is another excellent entry into the science fiction genre. In the hands of Steven Spielberg, he manages to infuse a very thought-provoking premise with a fun, action-packed screenplay making for a very entertaining, yet poignant film that brings about a lot of questions in the process. While the narrative isn't quite as focused as I'd hoped for in certain aspects, the film itself is still superbly produced, finely acted, and presented extremely well on Blu-ray by the people at Paramount. With reference A/V quality, a very informative plethora of extra features, and only an SRP of $29.99 (meaning you could probably get it for at least half-ish price), MinorityReport comes highly recommended.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Been sitting with this for about six months.  Have returned to it frequently and each time it has not disappointed. Just listened to NPR's first ever dance music review with an open mind, yet none of those featured artists' music makes my body move the way XX does.  This isn't club music, but it's informed by club music.  There's none of the bombastic thumbs, instead there's a sinewy thread formed by simple guitar riffs, similar to the Cure's use of guitars but with none of the anthemic quality, and simple tight drum beats and synth lines, with sexy male and female vocals.<br /><br />I recently gave an old fav a whirl, Everything But The Girl's The Walking Wounded, and found a parallel connection to this recording. (I like the band Faithless for similar reasons.)  Both make the body want to move, but are founded on space and possibilities rather than pre-formulated club sounds.  But then, clubs aren't necessarily about subtleties are they?
B001QB9H1K|5.0|Movie - 4.0    I really like the Transporter franchise. Its B-movie nature from the mind and pen of one Luc Besson has always been an entertaining escapist romp for me. The series has always been quasi-serious, but often silly enough that we realize it's all in good fun. Whether Frank Martin is saving Chinese refugees or stopping an archetypal Colombian hitman from unleashing a deadly virus, he always does so in such style thanks in huge part to the cool cars he drives, his spiffy suits, and the always-welcomed martial arts choreography of Hong Kong legend Cory Yuen. However, Transporter 3 takes somewhat of a different road in terms of its tone. One of the things I noticed from the first time I saw the trailer was the cinematography. With that said, this 3rd installment is easily the darkest so far. Don't let that fool you, though. The film still has its campy elements and occasional cheese. We see Frank do his thing having to transport more human cargo, getting into situations where butt-kicking is required, make a few wise cracks, and even get some cool chase sequences in and out of the car. But the big difference here is the philosophical approach it tries to take as represented by the interaction of Frank and Valentina. Throughout the franchise, we've seen Frank as a man of rules and principles. Here, we see the opposite in a young, unabashed, free-living Valentina. I actually like what her character's purpose is in trying to open Frank up a little more as a person (like Lai in the first film), but I seriously wish they had picked a different actress. Contrary to the cute and perky innocence Shu Qi has in Transporter 1, I often had a hard time accepting Natalya Rudakova's performance. It's not the Ukrainian accent and broken English, or even the crazy amount of freckles that bring her down, it's the angst. Granted, rich and spoiled teenage brat characters usually are angsty, but refer back to Shu Qi's performance (which is unequivocally the same role), and the comparison should speak for itself.    Video - 5.0    It's sad that the first two films fell under the MPEG-2 encode when they were released as some of Fox's flagship titles. Thankfully, though, Blu-ray has come a long way since then, which is reflected in the video presentation given to us by Lionsgate. With the movie itself being very recent and the current availability of MPEG-4 AVC, we get an absolutely pristine picture. Colors aren't too vibrant, what with the darker tone and photography, but it's more than made up for by everything else. Black levels are among the deepest I've seen to date. Frank's suit, the sleek paint on his Audi A8, even the tread in the tires all carry a great level of detail and delineation between one texture and the next. Contrast is just right in keeping other image details visible, while still maintaining the film's gritty look. And while flesh tones do appear reddish, it's not nearly as bad as the first movie, and in my opinion, actually helps in accentuating some of the finer details such as the face-stubble and ripped muscles of Statham or the heavy eyeliner and freckles of Rudakova, even through that fine layer of theatrical grain. No image enhancements or manipulation are apparent either, making this a showcase BD.    Audio - 5.0    The interesting thing about this 7.1 DTS-HD track is its spaciousness. Normally, a typical sound design will have 3 elements: dialogue in the center channel, music and sound effects from the fronts and side, and LFEs in the subwoofer. Here, we actually have the sound design separated into 4 different channels individually: music from the rear and sides, sound effects from the front, dialogue in the center, and LFEs in the sub. As a result, it creates a very unique kind of immersion. One factor I've always liked in the franchise is the music, not so much the score (which still isn't bad), but the Euro-techno stuff playing in the background, which is displaced perfectly throughout the back 4 speakers. Dialogue is clear and never a problem from the center, though some viewers may find it awkward that the sound effects are limited to just the front of the sound stage. However, bass levels are surprisingly thunderous and help make up for that, particularly the thuds and thumps when Statham kicks a guy right in the gut. I don't think I've ever had a sound effect outside of an explosion or piece of machinery make a sound like that, which is pretty invigorating. Then of course are the cars, gunshots, etc. that also sound flawless just to top things off for an otherwise, reference track.    Extras - 3.0    Also a new addition from the previous Transporter BDs is the presence of some actual special features. It's not much, but the commentary from director Olivier Megaton, and the two behind-the-scenes featurettes are appreciated. Throughout his commentary, Megaton breaks down the overall filming process very well and makes the movie much more appreciable than I initially felt before giving it a listen. I just wish they turned a lot of his commentary into a more in-depth making of-segment as opposed to a vocal-only presentation. The \\"Real World Transporter\\" feature is interesting, but a bit of a downer. It essentially de-glamorizes the concept of Frank Martin's character and tries to instill this feeling of rough and tough, but with absolutely no benefits to the lifestyle whatsoever. The \\"Making of Transporter 3\\" is more or less what Megaton covers in his commentary, which I still think is a little short in length in itself. But then again, any kind of extras for movies of this caliber are better than nothing.    Overall - 4.5    I think this 3rd installment actually could've been the best of the franchise. It still carries enough of the B-movie campiness and charm, but takes it up a level by trying to make the atmosphere much darker. Unfortunately, the female lead doesn't quite make it as enjoyable for me as I would've liked, but still think it's a good movie for what it'sworth. Can they make another one? Sure. But given the mixed levels of critical response and the fact that most movie franchises like to do things in 3s, I wouldn't be surprised if Statham decided to move on, if not for one more appearance as Chev Chelios, then at least beyond his role as Frank Martin into another action role. With reference A/V quality and a decent amount of extras, Transporter 3 comes recommended to fans.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|This album ROCKS in Devo's quirky, new wave way! It's like they picked up right where they left off in the very early '80's. Keyboard-heavy with just the right amount of guitar. And you'll recognize the classic Devo style when you hear just the first few notes of \\"Fresh\\" start up along with the beat. \\"What We Do\\" is the epitome of off-the-wall Devo style and is a really fun song when you recognize that. The afore mentioned songs are being pushed as the singles, but I predict \\"Later Is Now\\" will be the breakout hit (look out in the dance clubs). Most songs on the album are danceable, but to my surprise, there's even a ballad on this album (\\"No Place Like Home\\"). Truly something for everybody! I like that their songs still carry a message too. Mark Mothersbaugh said in an article I read that he thinks this is some of their best work. I agree. Kudos on the album cover too, boys. Simple yet sexy!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Movie - 5.0    Continuing to build on their hefty résumé of animated excellence, Pixar presents us with their next masterpiece in Up, a film that manages to further teach, amaze, and entertain audiences everywhere with its touching story, adventurous characters, and always-appreciated detail to attention and nuances. When I first saw this in theaters, I was bewildered in a lot of ways. This was the first Pixar movie I'd seen in theaters in a looong time, it was also my first 3D viewing, and it also reminded me of why I haven't tried watching said movies in a while (<-- noisy kids distracting me). But in buying the Blu-ray and having a chance to watch all the extras in the comfort of my own home, I dare say the movie left such a long-lasting, subconscious resonance, that I just about instantly remembered and picked up on so many of the wonderful themes addressed in the film's spectacular screenplay: age, dreams, preoccupation with life, feeling a sense of fulfillment, loneliness and separation, the hardships of death and the eventual resolve of letting the past go, companionship, and last but not least, the spirit of adventure(!). The movie itself succeeds on many levels, and a lot of that has to do with fine, fine voice acting from Ed Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and the various sound effects cues of Kevin via Tom Myers, the sound designer. The script thoroughly and deservedly reflects that innocence I mentioned and evokes something of an almost goofy, yet chummy quality throughout the film. Right from the get go of Muntz's opening film reel to the very end when Carl awards Russell the Ellie Badge are we captivated in such amorous ambiance. Literally, the movie is a wondrous adventure within itself. Up is a masterpiece. But in saying what I've already said, it's really just a matter of seeing and believing it for yourself. Certainly, everybody's interpretation or opinion on the film will vary, but here's hoping this writer's take will help some of you to seethe great qualities that make this film so very, very enjoyable. Up is definitely one for the ages.    Video - 5.0    Presented by Disney/Buena Vista in glorious 1080p using AVC and an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, it shouldn't be any surprise that Pixar-to-BD equals a perfect score. They're world-renowned for their art and animation as it is, so a direct digital transfer should be a no-brainer. The plethora of color schemes is fantastic. Vibrancy amongst the different locales, isolated locations, and various environments/characters are perfect. Edges are as straight and smooth as a computer can make them. Contrast and black levels have zero discrepancy, and there's not a single sign of aliasing, saturation, banding, EE, DNR, artifacts, noise, or bad editing. The transfer is flawless and worthy of CG demonstration to your guests.    Audio - 5.0    As with most Pixar/Disney movies, a lot of the sound relies on dialogue and music, with environmental and incidental sound effects on the side. With that said, Up's DTS-HD MA 5.1 track is as crisp and clean as the video. Dialogue is crystal clear with directionality and effortless noise distribution across the front stage. Separation between voices and the uplifting score by Michael Giacchino is also spot on. Surrounds are subtle at first until Carl actually gets his house up and flying into the air. The creaking of the house and inflation of the balloons are great and all, but I'd say the funner parts are during their trip into the storm and dog fight sequence towards the end. LFEs are especially prominent when that thunderstorm starts thundering. It's so scary and ominous, yet so cool and sexy for audiophiles. This is yet another outstanding audio effort from Pixar Studios to demo your systems with.    Extras - 4.0    Yes, as spectacular as the movie and A/V specs are, the Extras, while cool in their all-HD-ness, only get a 4 from me. The Cine-Explore takes commentary beyond commentary with it's innovative P-i-P approach using storyboards, CG composites, etc. to give audiences a more in-depth look at the film's construction. It's really cool, and I really appreciate Pete Docter and Bob Peterson's insight. I also really enjoy the Pixar shorts and idea of an interactive game. But only 48 minutes of production documentaries? I expected a little more than that. What about interviews with Asner and Nagai or Tim Myers and the rest of the sound crew? The documentaries, while extremely intriguing and informational, feel a bit too short, in my opinion, and very truncated in terms of the scope they could've achieved. Ah, well. Kudos to the production and art staff for their efforts anyway.    Overall - 5.0    Movie, Video, and Audio are on a level of excellence I think we've all come to expect from Pixar and Disney/Buena Vista these days. While the Extras leave just tad more to be desired, I can't see any reason in the Milky Way why I wouldn't recommend this intriguing work of art known as Up. It's a heartwarming, uplifting, and fun-for-the-whole-audience-adventure movie that will have you crying, laughing, and cheering all sorts of things.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I have given this book four stars because it was well written, pulling me through the story.  However, I prefer a book that makes me feel better for having read it, and this instead contained descriptions of (in my opinion) sadistic sex and sick murders.  It's difficult to get those images out of my mind.  This is no reflection on the author, just a comment that might be beneficial to someone who has reading preferences similar to mine.
B000E33W1W|3.0|Ghostbusters is a pretty good and fun FILM,For alot of people it's a Cult Classic and that's understandable. It's not Complicated,It's campy and funny. I Really Liked Rick Moranis and Dan Aykroyd's performances.

Unbelievable energy, even better as an inspiring human being.

0307454541|4.0|It has been a long while since I read any mystery thrillers, leave alone anything Swedish. I read Larsson's book on the recommendation of a friend. The paperback is long, running into more than 800 pages. Apparently, the tile of the book in its original Swedish is closer to 'Men who hate women'. Having read the book, I feel it is a better summary of the book than its English title.<br />After the initial 100 pages, during which time the scene is set, the book gathers great pace and I couldn't put it down almost till the end. The mystery practically ends well before the final 100 pages. But you get quite involved with the many characters in the book by then that you still want to see what happens to them afterwards.<br />The broad plot of the book revolves around the sudden disappearance of Harriet, the  favorite grand daughter of Henrik Vanger, who is a big Swedish industrial baron. Forty years after the disappearance, Vanger hires Blomkvist, a journalist condemned to serve a prison term in a libel case, to crack the case and find out what happened to his grand-daughter. The rest of the story is about how Blomkvist gradually gets on to the job with Lisbeth Salander, his research associate. You will have to read the novel to know whether they succeed or not.<br />The novel has very interesting characters like Lisbeth, Henrik Vanger and many of his extended family members. Lisbeth Salander seems to be the author's personal favorite though!<br />The book is also much about the violence against women in Sweden. This is the aspect of the book that captured much of my interest apart from the mystery. One has an image of Nordic societies as harmonious and the women having achieved high levels of development on their own strength. Larsson strongly disagrees by showing the extent of violence against women which he suggests is pervasive in Swedish society. The description of violence is at times quite graphic but the author is quite sympathetic to  women all through. There is also the character of Lisbeth Salander, who is a social misfit but smart at the same time. However, the Swedish state interferes too far into her life ostensibly to protect her but ending up making it difficult for her to save herself from abuse.<br />The story also focusses much on high levels of corruption in High finance in Sweden and this seems very relevant as I read the book in 2010! If there is one aspect of the book that stretches your credibility, it is the perfection with which Lisbeth executes her job with computers in high finance. The timing and ease with which she performs is a little too smooth for one's comfort. She is a little too clever to be true.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and found it educational about Swedish society in some ways, even though I realize that it is not the total picture. A must read for anyone who likes mystery thrillers.cter of Lisbeth Salander, who is a social misfit but smart at the same time.

B002ZG99CC|5.0|I need to start off by saying, I saw the first Karate kid several times, and I loved it Several times. I confess I still had a bitter taste from Jaden Smith's Difficult, Ungrateful Brat; in \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still.\\" I know it was only acting, but it was still tough to take. I wondered how this character would behave. I love Jackie Chan, I love Kung Fu movies in general. I love Asian settings and philosophy. I couldn't resist. I went into the movie with no expectations that it would mirror the first.   Well, to make a long story short. I loved this movie! My heart and my mind were both deeply affected. I left the theater wishing the movie wasn't over, yet feeling completely satisfied with what I had seen. Honestly I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie. It follows the concept of the first closely enough to make you feel nostalgic, but gives you a fresh different take. The action was good. and The lessons learned by everyone both physically and emotionally were enough to keep your own emotions working overtime. I am very particular about what I need from a movie. None of us can afford to waist money or time on something not worth it. I recommend this movie. Whether you see it in theaters or wait for DVD My opinion is... It is worth it.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|Now this is more like it! Awesome guitar work! This follows the usual Ozzy album pattern: 3 really good songs, a few middle-of-the-road songs, and a few throwaways. The difference is the middle-of-the-road songs on Scream are 10 times better than Black Rain and a hundred times better than Down to Earth (I think I listened to Down to Earth maybe two times total). This is a really strong album from Ozzy. I thought he might be losing it with the last couple, but this is definitely a step back in the right direction. He's not going to make a classic anymore, but it's still Ozzy.
B00092ZL80|5.0|The vast number of excellent reviews of this concert sufficiently puts the nit-picky criticisms to bed, so I'll only briefly address critics by saying that any reviewer who would comment that the sound engineering was poor enough to make the concert as exciting as a \\"PBS pledge drive\\" either watched this concert with the power off or with a sack over his head, or both. The disk's engineers tackle well the difficult job of toggling back and forth between one large band and then two playing simultaneously. The resulting DVD sounds very good and is filmed well, despite some overly zippy editing and (inexcusable) failure to detail most of the guitar finger work. It's true that there's been a weakening of vocals in both bands, but that's inevitable given the passage of time and easily overlooked when one considers the electricity these performers still discharge on stage. I saw the bands together at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland and can attest that they give 110% pure energy. Special shouts go out to EWF trombonist Reggie Young whose feet are in permanent motion throughout the concert and whose personality clearly and happily infects the whole theater. EWF's David Whitworth sounds great and keeps the energy level high. Watch for inspired solos by EWF guitarist Vadim Zilberstein. Chicago's Keith Howland must be one of the great underestimated guitarists in the business. Effortless is not a strong enough word to describe the way he plays lightning-fast, crisp Hendrix-Kath-inspired guitar. It's a pleasure to watch the joyous interaction between drummers Tris Imboden and John Paris; the expressions on their faces say more about this concert than all the words on this webpage. During the two-band finale, the whole stage shakes, which is interestingly captured in some of the camera work. One reviewer says of the finale that he dances on the walls every time he watches; that ought to be a sight. I'll simply say that they close with a blazing three-guitar fest--Howland,Zilberstein, and Greg Moore--on \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" that absolutely blows your doors off. Review no. 179. Hope it is helpful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to get into this series initially. The subject matter seemed too brutal to really enjoy. I mean, a bunch of kids made to kill each other? That's entertainment?<br /><br />But oh it is. And I enjoyed every bit of it.<br /><br />The story is well summarized in other reviews, so I'll just that I highly recommend it. You'll root for Katniss, and even some of the other tributes. You'll be ashamed at some of her actions, you'll ache for her as she is forced to do horrible things and you'll cheer for her when things go her way.<br /><br />And being involved in characters this way, well doesn't that say it all?
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This is definitely one of the best live DVDs I own.  If you are a fan of Dream Theater, this is the DVD I would purchase from them.  If you are not very familiar with Dream Theater, but like a mixture of rock, metal, pretty melodies, and exciting keyboard and guitar solos; this is a great find.  Dream Theater puts on 3 hour long shows and it is entertaining from beginning to end.  The camera work and sound quality is very well above par.  So, the concert experience is great.  The second disc is great too!  It features a unique, interactive (with audience) drum solo from Mike Portnoy, a well-made documentary of the band touring around Japan on a train (ironically the 'Train of Thought'), and other content such as a walkthrough of John Petrucci's guitar rig.  I think rock and metal fans would be interested in this, but Dream Theater fans should definitely have this for it is a greatly recorded concert that shows the very best of what Dream Theater can do.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read a few reviews that said this book wasn't as good as the first, but I disagree. I gobbled it up in less than two days.<br /><br />The story picks up after the Katniss wins the Hunger Games, and follows her and Peeta while they tour the districts. She finds out the Capitol is not pleased with her, and she's told in no uncertain terms that she must make President Snow believe that they are in love, so she and those she cares about will suffer.<br /><br />Mid way through, she realizes that won't happen and now she's faced with a choice. Become the poster girl for the revolution that will happen with or without her, or do her best to just keep her and her family alive and let everyone else fend for themselves.<br /><br />I liked how Katniss has developed over the course of the two books. In the first, she was impulsive, moody and stubborn. She's still all those things, but you can feel the changes in her, and her growing ip.<br /><br />Ms. Collins knows her stuff. She knows how to write emotions well and how to develop her characters well. You feel for these kids, and you root for them. It's a brutal subject and one that is very well done.<br /><br />I'm eagerly awaiting the conclusion to this series.
0446402397|5.0|Funny thing, reviewing books. Where to start? What to say? Oddly enough, I'll begin with page 439, the very last page. No spoilers! Tom Rob Smith provides a list of books he used in researching his subject before he put fingers to keyboard:<br /><br />He identifies a book detailing the real-life crimes of a particular Soviet citizen.<br />He includes a book on Russian police procedure, another on the justice system.<br />He lists books about the gulags, and ones about general historical background.<br /><br />In the \\"Acknowledgments\\" sections he thanks a Russian friend who verified and/or corrected various pieces of information he included as components of Soviet life.<br /><br />All the above just to say that \\"Child 44\\" is well-grounded: historically, socially, economically, educationally, and so on.<br /><br />\\"Child 44\\" is fictional account of an actual murder spree committed by one person and those who pursued him and others who pursued the pursuers.<br /><br />Tom Rob Smith, a screenwriter, offers this 2008 book as commentary on Soviet life: a serial killer of children, one the state will not recognize (Why, you ask? Because the Soviet Union was a country based on true equality designed to give citizens equal opportunities, when in reality there was nothing true or equal about this country. For the Soviets, to acknowledge serial killers, admits defeat in their State--even though the system actually benefited the Few and squashed/killed the Many.)<br /><br />By the way, this was such a fascinating story, so engaging, that I did something I haven't done in many years: I had to look at the last page of the story to discover if....well, I'm not saying, but I found what I was looking for, enabling me to continue reading in tension, but, at least, with a tad of relief.<br /><br />Smith writes as if he had a deck of cards, shuffled and laid out with intentionality: one card here, three cards there, a big stack just there, a few in that stack, and so on. Each stack (or single) represents a story line. Even from the beginning I found myself saying: I can't wait to discover how all these back stories fit together! Even from the beginning, I knew Smith would have no problem bringing all these elements and story lines together.<br />Other writers also work multiple story lines, but Smith's technique is different--as a reader, I didn't feel he left the reader hanging at the end of each episode.<br /><br />Normally, I start flying through a story that gives this bit of story, then goes to the next, then back or to the next just to put all those pieces together. Instead I read to savor what Smith was doing as a storyteller. For sure, Smith is a gifted writer, not only in informational/historical story lines and characterizations, but in insights into the human heart without moralizing.<br /><br />It is difficult to review a book like \\"Child 44\\" and avoid spoilers, but the novel is too well-constructed and considered to give any clues to ruin anything for the next reader. Suffice it to say that \\"Child 44\\" is a great reading experience!<br /><br />However, here's a list of some story elements:<br /><br />-A snowball filled with rocks and dirt<br />-sucking tree bark for nutrients<br />-a marriage kindled by tradition and fear<br />-hundreds of hooks on strings dangling at the end of the last railway car<br />-an injection of camphor oil as truth serum<br />-double agents within Soviet society<br />-Nazis as psychosis-induced monsters<br /><br />That's it--a little list of important elements out of context.

1594481717|5.0|[[ASIN:0814414052 The Other Kind of Smart: Simple Ways to Boost Your Emotional Intelligence for Greater Personal Effectiveness and Success]]    It would be interesting to be able to look into the future and see how history treats this book. As we look around we can see a lot of what Daniel Pink mentions in the book happenning today. There is increasing interest in a search for meaning, spirituality, emotional intelligence and ways of tying it all together.     The author argues that society has in the past not appreciated right brain thinkers as much as left brain.  However, the people who reach the highest levels in business, government and military have always been expected to have the ability to see the large picture, requiring them to tie together various diverse elements of information. This skill has been deemed to be so important that we are willing to pay corporate CEO's who posess it vast sums of money.     For me, the book is not so much a debate about the left brain/right brain and which is superior. We have both and need both. It points towards a new awareness that regardless of the technical advancements we achieve and material posessions that we are able to obtain, we will always find ourselves wanting. The new frontier will be about how well we are able to establish meaningful relationships with one another and the world around us.     A fascinating book that I think will be debated, talked about and remembered for decades in the future.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. I remember the original series and didn't think I would like the movie, I loved the spin-off series' and some of the older movies. They did an excellent job of making a new movie that grabs you. It stays true to the original series and yet is a new story of them getting together. A definite watch and as much as I cut back on purchasing movies I had to have this one.

The trail takes them from ancient hidden chambers to international seed vaults as they follow the Black Madonna legend.

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This is the best album I've bought all year, period! The beats are a blend of African tribal chants and instruments mixed up with some New York bass thumping. It was more then amazing, it was fresh! No remixes, no auto-tunes, no commercialized pop sound, just two seasoned and intellectual artists doing what they were born to do: drop politically and culturally deep messages through the tool of hip-hop.    My only critique is of the song \\"My Generation\\" ft. Lil Wayne. All due respect to the lyrical skill of Lil Wayne, but the type of ideals his music espouses are in direct conflict with those of this album; he seemed out of place and to top it off that's probably the weakest track on the album. Maybe his appearance on the album will mark a shift to more conscience hip-hop. We'll have to wait and see.    Best tracks on the album IMO are \\"Tribal War, Despair, and Nahmean?\\". All three tracks not only had a powerful energy, but they teach you things you normally only learn in school. The 5 step break down of violence in \\"Tribal War\\" I studied in my upper-division course on warfare last semester. I spent thousands on that class and learned what the class taught me in a single verse on a $10 album, go figure.    It's an empowering and uniting album without a doubt:    \\"We're all distant relatives, no matter where you from, where you live  How near or far...  Africa, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel...  We're all fam, we're all distant relatives  So that's why we came together,  'Cause we all come from one place, and that's Africa  That's right, you too. And you.  The whole world!  We're all family, we're just spread out all over the place  So to all my distant relatives, let's take it back home!\\"

B000YXMMAE|5.0|Quality of album:  This album is simply amazing, words can't describe this masterpiece.  You would think that there would be some weak link, one song that you just can't stand, but their isn't one.  Of course, that is what Radiohead has been doing for the past two decades (90's and 00's).  This album isn't one of those albums that hits you right over your head with its brillance, it's like wine.  It really grows on you.  It makes you think...      Change?:  Radiohead is an alternative of what you commonly hear on the radio.  They don't break glass and turn it into something they are not.    Which album is the best?:  Many people say this is Radiohead's \\"Best.\\"  It's hard to say... only time would answer that question.  The problem simply is you can't compare \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" to \\"Kid A\\" because of style changes.  Radiohead:  Rock/ Alt, Jazz/ Electricona, Acoustic, Rock/ Pop, Pop, and a little bit of Blues...  What can I say, they are accomplished, it makes me proud of my music: at least someone out there is producing classics that wouldn't wane over time.    Content:  \\"I'm all the days,that you choose to ignore,\\" another great lyric by them.  If you are still wondering about the lyrics, they are obviously about how we effect the environment, where we live.    If Radiohead had its own radio station, that radio station would be the greatest!  Just imagin... \\"Karma Police,\\" \\"Everything in its right place,\\" to \\"15 Step!\\"

B001OQCV6A|1.0|Perhaps in a world containing millions of dedicated fans, true aficionado's of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous literary character (Sherlock Holmes), it would be possible to find ONE individual who believes this motion picture adaptation worthy of purchasing. Likely, this ONE person is the same individual who purchases EVERYTHING with the same \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" attached to it. However, I am convinced, that no loyal Sherlockian could EVER consider this adaptation faithful to the literary intent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Certainly, the portrayal of Holmes far closer to a Harrison Ford-like production of Indiana Jones (or perhaps a very poorly made James Bond film) from a previous period of history. [I was also slightly reminded of Dr. House in terms of Holmes' arrogance and poor treatment of other people.]     Almost nothing in this film reminds anyone of ANY previous Holmes portrayal: Rathbone, Howard, Cushing, Brett, Fewer, etc. Holmes becomes merely a pathetic action figure.     There is no evidence of the DEEP EMOTIONAL bonding that occurs between Holmes and Watson. Rather Holmes and Watson both treat one another rudely. While one cannot deny that this does occasionally occur in Doyle's stories, it is not the norm of their relationship.     Using my own DEDUCTIVE reasoning, I conclude that this film:     Was written for a 21st century audience who:                     -- cares little about preserving the intent of writers                     -- has to see sex in every movie (even though there is NO evidence that Holmes would EVER engage sexually -                            and much evidence to suggest that Holmes would not, especially with a woman)                      -- adores Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law (even though their acting was nothing spectacular)                      -- write reviews praising the film that say 'this film was so good' without explaining what made it 'so good' [Of course, there are some exceptions.]-- who will rate a review negatively (often without reading it) simply because they disagree with the reasonable conclusions of the writer         Lastly:     If you just want to purchase another typical motion picture production that is poor edited, full of contradictions, similar to the previous 100 action films, than this is the film for you.     If you wish to purchase an intelligent series of Sherlock Holmes films (that show the multi-dimensional nature of Holmes and Watson), I recommend the series starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes and David Burke/Edward Hardwicke as Dr. John Watson. The Brett series is FAR more mentally stimulating for individuals who desire to preserve the legacy of Doyle's famous consulting detective.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|My introduction to The Road Warrior and Mel Gibson began in the summer of 1982 when it was shown during its first run at the long gone local drive-in. The apocalyptic aspect of the story as well as the awesome stunt work had a profound impact on me then. Now it stands as a true cinematic classic especially when you consider how much CGI is overutilized these days. It also became the template for Mel Gibson's acting career by playing the reluctant hero who only gets involved when he's pushed too far. This is also a great example of how an older film is supposed to be transferred to blu-ray. I would probably upgrade more older films from DVD but it seems to be very hit and miss with the older titles. Don't hesitate to upgrade this one because the PQ and AQ is exceptional.
B00076ZZ9I|1.0|No, of course not the album, which is obviously a classic.  The dual-disc is a complete ripoff in relation to its advertising.  As an audiophile (wannabe), I bought this version for the \\"entire album in enhanced LPCM Stereo\\" on the DVD side.  Typically that would be at a much higher sampling rate, better bit depth, or something enhanced.  In this case its 48khz, 16 bit PCM, which is basically the same quality as the CD side (more or less, perhaps a slight uptick).  They didn't even use that much of the available storage on the DVD side and they gave us this!  It's just wrong, wrong, wrong.  Poor product design and deceptive advertising.  No wonder this version is not a classic with the audiophiles.  Who makes these decisions?
B000002MJR|3.0|Basically their last album as a working band, this live overview is taken from the tour that backed 1991's On Every Street album. Mostly comprised of material from the band's last two releases (although you can't avoid yet another workout on \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" this one almost two minutes longer than the live Alchemy version), Dire Straits sound loose and relaxed. The real treats are the live versions of standout songs from Brothers in Arms, particularly \\"Walk of Life.\\" Knopfler is in fine voice and the playing is tight and intuitive, if characteristically meandering (it takes 10 1/2 minutes to get through \\"Calling Elvis\\" on the opener). But it's all about mood and atmosphere and On The Night fits in comfortably in their catalog alongside Alchemy. It's an unremarkable (hence 3 stars rather than four) but satisfying farewell serving, essentially the equivalent of a double LP at 75+ minutes.

B003HFFVEA|3.0|Very quick take on the CD/DVD combo of the Chemical Brothers \\"Further.\\"  I tend to for the most part think the Chemical Brothers are interesting electronic artists and always have something to offer.  Hence, I had to buy the CD/DVD.  Bluntly put the DVD aspect does not justify the price.  Not only are the visuals not on par with any of their standard music videos but, they are not even fun to watch in a \\"so bad it's good\\" kind of way.  A summary of the DVD is the girl on the cover dives into the ocean, then there are a bunch of dots dancing around for a long time, then the girls shadow is walking with dots and a generic psychedelic backdrop.  Then a horse is made of paper machete, some green slime pulsates and the girl comes out of the water.  Again, the DVD would be okay if it was free but, even then you are better off hearing the album and letting your imagination take hold.  If you must have the dvd I would recommend watching it after you have had time to hear the album multiple times.  Otherwise you will be associating these songs with dots, faces, water, and paper matche horses.  Again, I just posted a review because I was looking to read one before buying this and there was not one out there.  I'm the kind of person that would always wonder what was on the dvd.  Wish I was left wondering it would have been more interesting.  Also, on the music note this does not seem to be one of their better releases.  There are not many tracks with the breezyness of \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" or the offbeat \\"Salmon Song.\\"  Other reviews will dig deeper into the audio, I don't wanna go there after just hearing the album for one day.  Sometimes things grow on you just at surface level there are no real stand outs.
1592289444|4.0|Amazing journey as measured by geography, emotional, spiritual and humanity.  It is amazing what the human body and spirit can endure and yet, remain empathetic and caring.  As westerners we are not exposed to such things unless we have traveled and this book is indeed a journey well worth the read!
0307265730|2.0|As other reviewers have noted, the stories follow a monotonous theme of second generation American Bengalis, who often have an under layer of lust lurking beneath while they  struggle with or hate their dead/distanced parents. It was a chore to finish the book. Borrow it from a library if you really want to read it.
B001QBXFTA|3.0|The recorded sound is clear but quite harsh.  The lead violin is also sometimes abrasive and wayward. If you buy 22 CDs of a quartet you'd better like the way they sound, and I expect most won't. There is just too much competiton in this repertoire to recommend this set except the price. The even older Amadeus partial survey sounds much better, and for a complete cycle the Angeles set is excellent.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Eminem! To me he is one of the best artist lyrically out there. His music comes straight from the heart and you can really feel what he is going through. The reason he's the best is because he is a story teller through music. He has the most passion for his music more than any other rapper/artist out there. He is truly a genius like Michelangelo and the Sixteenth Chapel. His last few albums were OK, but this album blew me off my feet! The Relapse was good and the Refill was amazing. But now with his new album the Recovery OMG it is one of the best albums I have ever listen to!!!! In this album he said he's back and I hope this is true. I know we all go through tough times in our life and he had stuff to deal with. As you listen to the album you will understand what he has been going through. Now that he's back I really hope he keeps putting albums out like this one!!!! No album he puts out is bad though because he's talking about his life and his flow is unbelievable. But this album destroys all of his other albums out of the water. This album really shows off his talent and it also shows what kind of genesis he truly is. The one reason I think Eminem is the great artist he is today is because he has been through so much and it comes out in his music. I don't have the same lifestyle as he does, but there are many issues and songs I can relate too. His music has helped me out through my up's and down's. Another reason he is so good is that each album and or song you can see his different sides. You really get to know Mathers serious side, angry side, father side and funny side. Each part of him makes him the rapper he is today. This album by far shows off his true talent and this album is way over due. I really hope he sticks with his music and he keeps producing amazing albums likes this one. There is not a single track on here that I don't like which is very uncommon for me and most people. Usually when I buy an album there are some songs I love and some songs I skip over, but with this album I can listen to it straight through. Eminem better stay with producing and making music because if he stopped it would be like throwing away a good talent or not even finishing the Mona Lissa. It would be like if the president stopped working. Shady you have my support all the way and you're by-far the best artist mentally and lyrically ever and ever will be!!! Everyone who loves music should def purchase and listen to this album!!! I also thought this album was so good that I ended up buying this album twice in the same day. I bough the regular CD version and then I also bought the Deluxe version on i-Tunes. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!!!songs I love and some songs I skip over, but with this album I can listen to it straight through. Eminem better stay with producing and making music because if he stopped it would be like throwing away a good talent or not even finishing the Mona Lissa. It would be like if the president stopped working. Shady you have my support all the way and you're by-far the best artist mentally and lyrically ever and ever will be!!!

B003KUSUG8|2.0|This is the first Eminem release that didn't grab me immediately. Relapse was my favorite record by him.  It pushed the bounds of bizarre, had great beats, and sounded good production-wise.  This one has a lot of singing and rock-music samples.  He's done this before, and it has never worked (for me).  I'm really missing the Dre beats as well. I've never gotten an em cd where I skipped songs half-way through them while thinking to myself \\"wow this is bad\\" until this one.  For me, he was always at his best when he was running his strange brew of dark, mischievous, manic comedy.  I never liked the screaming or overly emotional stuff.  I usually skipped it.  Which is ok if it is only one or two tracks.  But it is pretty much this entire album. The party songs, like \\"Crack a Bottle\\" from Relapse were never my thing either, although they were tolerable with Dre beats. \\"White Trash Party\\"? Ok, now you're starting to sound like Kid Rock heh.  He rips Relapse in one of his songs, I don't get it.  I loved the accents.  Gah.  I guess if you didn't like Relapse, but liked stuff like \\"Toy Soldiers\\" and other em tunes where he gets \\"introspective\\", \\"mature\\"(lol) and \\"emotional\\", this would be for you.  There isn't any good witty stuff like \\"Bagpipes from Baghdad\\" here, though.  I guess to sum it up for me, it is lacking the quips, the sharpness of delivery, the comedy, and the production values of Relapse.  I'll give it a couple more listens, maybe it is like some prog metal cds you have to listen to a few times to get, but I highly doubt it.  Bah the absurdism, it is missing!
0618918248|1.0|I'm not religious and I have nothing against most forms of religion. That said, this book is too radical. After my husband read it, he became very intolerant of religious people. The amount of feeling this book generated is not what we need as a society. We need people to become more tolerant of each other, not more hateful.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Many other reviewers have given Susan's first album 5 stars, and I can't honestly add much to all the accolades she's gotten.  All I can say is that if you haven't heard this CD, you are missing some of the very best music ever recorded....
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Even if you are not a dog lover, you will end up loving dogs after reading this book.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|I've been a fan of the Roots since DYWM?!!?!! and what has always impressed me is the quality of music that they have brought on each and every album over the last 16-17 years. Each album has its own musical sound and identity, and each has always had a cohesiveness that many of today's musical releases lack. Where many popular albums are more or less collections of \\"singles\\", the Roots continue to make \\"albums.\\" This release is no different.    Simply put, this album is amazing. Unlike some of the reviewers thus far I have enjoyed the bands output in the 2000's, but this album easily trumps all of them, even Game Theory and Rising Down. Personally Things Fall Apart (1999) is at the top of the heap and after multiple listens HIGO is likely to land just behind it on my personal fave list alongside Illadelph Halflife.     What I have found with this album is that Questlove has outdone himself with the sequencing of the album. It is hard to not listen to the entire album at a time simply because the songs flow so well into another. I never find myself searching for the \\"next\\" button.    If you are a fan of the Roots and music in general then do yourself a favor and pick this up.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I ordered Iron Man Bluray couple weeks ago, and i saw it couple times already. The video is quite impressive, so its the sound.  A fun movie to watch with friends. Extras are good, Gag reel, documentaries, and Robert Downey jr. screen test among other things.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Right from the first song I knew Eminem had brought it this time.  He killed it from start to finish.  Some say he tried to sing too much on this album, but im ok with it.  I loved that he trashed Relapse too, it was blah!!!  So I will make this short, I hate long reviews.   Get the album!!!!!  Its worth it.
0156421178|5.0|1984 and Animal Farm are Orwell's best remembered indictments of Communist tyranny, but this is his best book. From stories of fighting in a quasi-Trotskyist platoon he offers some of the best insight and overview ever written about the Spanish Civil War--a fight that foreshadowed both World War II and the Cold War. He entered the fight to preserve the democratic Republic from Fascism and escaped with his life fleeing the wrath of Communists.
B003LYJUXU|5.0|Having purchased this US version, I was happy to see that \\"Champagne Supernova\\" was included as it was a US single.  But I was dearly disappointed to see that the UK hidden track, \\"Sunday Morning Call,\\" was left off, even though the MP3 album offered here on Amazon includes the hidden track.  Confused?  I am...    I'm kind of left in the middle--UK version without Champagne Supernova or US without Sunday Morning Call...    But what is on both versions are loads of excellent tunes and a worth addition to most cd collections.  Some of their later stuff is unfairly maligned, I think.
B003PWPGT0|2.0|This sounds like Tom and his cronies had a great time recording Mojo. On one hand they succeeded in capturing the sound of a \\"live\\" band on CD. On the other hand this kind of jam-band affair gets tedious in a hurry without a strong set of songs. Maybe all those covers he plays live have messed with his head. I'm sure this would sound great as background music in a local bar...as long as I didn't have to pay a cover.
B000UVLK1M|5.0|An exceptional album that blends the essence of J Mitchell tunes with thoughtful and compelling HH jazz.  A contemplative album that mines the past reinterpreting it in a fresh / timeless manner.
B00006F1IJ|3.0|Nice music, but not as good as some of their later work. I listen to this at work and it fills the need, but I have a hard time telling anyone to run out and buy it.
B00275EGX8|1.0|2 hours of your life you will want back!!!    The only logical reason that this movie won any awards is:  People in Hollywood like to vote for ex-wives.  Any other reason for this movie winning any awards would be categorized as illogical.  The writing was bad.  Acting was bad.  Directing and editting were bad.  There were several times where I thought I was watching someone's senior year screenwriting video.  (Actually, I apologize for that remark.)  Someone's C-grade screenwriting video.  The reviews heralded \\"edge of the seat\\" excitement.  Nope.  Every character is a stereotype, and not necessarily the right stereotype for the story.  Many people have pointed out the hundreds of \\"technical\\" faults.  I will say purposeful removal of the American flag was glaring.  Please don't buy this movie.  I have nearly 1000 DVDs & Blu-rays and I am very thankful that I Netflix'd this one.  Even my teenage boy was bored by the story.  His quote was \\"can we watch Avatar or a Bourne movie, I feel like I need to clear that out of my head.\\"  By far the worst movie to win \\"Best Picture\\" in a long time.  James Cameron was completely ripped off (although I'm sure his bank account gives him some solace. LOL)
0736092269|5.0|This book has numerous illustrations that show nearly every nook and cranny of the musculoskeletal system and I was impressed with the variety of exercises they depict.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Let's be frank. I have nothing against Darryl Jones, he's a great bass player. But you just listen to \\"Plundered My Soul\\" featuring Bill Wyman. Isn't it the best Stones single in years? This is 100% Rolling Stones. It's easy to understand why people is buying this great album a lot.  So my suggestion is, the Stones should find a more 'bluesy' and 'warm' bass player, more close the the roots of the group.  A funky bassist is OK, but it makes the Stones sound cold.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|this has to be cyndi laupers best cd's ever- its raw- its emotional- its pure blues at its best- cyndis vocals are so great on the cd! \\"done cry no more\\" is an instant classic! fans will not be disappointed!!!!!
0385341008|5.0|After hearing very good things about this book, I decided to pick it up and could hardly put it down once I got started.  Though I was initially unsure about the format, being written entirely as a collection of letters (this device is called an epistolary novel), I quickly adapted to the structure.  The novel itself is a post-war reflection of the occupation of the Channel Islands by the Germans during WWII and I found this little-known aspect of the war very fascinating.  The characters are loveable and the authors do a great job of reflecting their personality in the styles of their correspondence.  I found it especially charming that even Oscar Wilde makes an indirect cameo.  This novel offers everything:  great history, wonderful characters, literary discourse, and just enough romance without being overly saccharine.  Overall, this book was a delight!
1935251740|5.0|Lanza's unchallengable scientific qualifications along with his sometimes surprising humanity make this a memorable and beautiful book. Quantum Physics is a hobby of mine and I have read several books (as well as taking college courses) on the subject. Much of the theory and experiments described were quite familiar to me but the authors give some a new slant. I found the book mostly to offer a most hopeful explanation of the mysteries of this life that we all find ourselves so involved in. I LOVED this book.
B00003CXRM|5.0|George Clooney is utterly convincing as an intelligent yet unsophisticated con artist. He and his friends, Pete and Delmar, take us on a journey that we won't soon forget. You will be laughing so much and so hard that your ribs will be sore for days!<br />You just haven't lived until you've seen this movie and gotten the giggle hiccups.
0790729350|2.0|I had mixed feelings on this. The music was real good and I'm sure that they did the best they could with what they had to work with back in that time period. However, the split screen stuff was just really annoying. There were really good things going on with both screens but you could only follow one lest you lose your place on that one by following the other. It was like watching 2 TV's at the same time and trying to keep up with both stories. It was OK, but if I could do it all over again, I would not have bought it.
B000002RXS|5.0|This seems to be a good quality recording and an excellent addition to any Opera fan's collection.  I looked at the reviews from other people who have this set and was not disappointed in my selection.
B003KRJNBW|2.0|Did I hear right? He walked west for 30 years? Well, let's see. The average human walking speed is 4.3 mph. That means that if you walk 1 hour per day times 5 days per week times 4 weeks per month times 12 months per year times 30 years you get: 4.3 x 5 x 4 x 12 x 30 = 30960 miles. Now, this is more that the circumference of the earth at the equator (which is 24901 miles). In other words, walking only one hour per day he will go around earth at least once considering him being able to walk on water. This is not the only mistake in this movie. For example, what happened to the water? Those clouds behind Denzel are not made out of water? You would think if there are clouds there is water and rain! I suppose Mr. Washington is getting old and therefore he must settle for mediocre movies.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|The Roots are on top of their game. This classic release speaks for itself. Soulful, creative, inspiring, the triple threat indeed. Might be a lil short in length, but its all about quality as far as The Roots are concerned. My favorite is \\"Now or Never\\". I've been a big fan of Little Brother so I'm glad they invited Phonte from LB on this one. Need some inspiration and something that proves HipHop is where its at, listen to this.
B000NA77YO|5.0|Ronnie James Dio was one of the best metal singers in the history of Heavy Metal. I enjoy listening to his music from the days he was singing for the group Elf up to his final years in the group Heaven and Hell. His music will live on in the the hearts of all his fans and enjoyed by future fans.
B0002IU988|4.0|Nice effort from the rest of Creed.  I especially like Metallingus.  Good disc to keep in your car.  I would have liked a couple more metalesque tracks, but this is a good solid album.  I especially like that the band did not dissolve after Scott Stapp departed to resolve his addiction issues.  I like both Alter Bridge albums but this one is a little better in my opinion.  Hope this helps.
0060899220|3.0|I bought this because I heard good things and because I am a fan of his Travel Channel show, No Reservations. It is basically his autobiography, with a bit of how-to thrown in there. The parts I enjoyed were his suggestions for what to order from restaraunts on what day (because of freshness, etc.) and his gimmicky, hold-no-punches approach to story telling. What I didn't like is that a lot of the how-to when it came to actual cooking was so far beyond me, as I am not a classic-French trained chef. Oh well, it's worth reading for sure, but not his best book as a whole.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|What a great album. Cyndi Lauper really deserves credit for her work. Hard to find a serious artist like her. Her work is one the best this summer. She not only supports the gay community but she also supports all communities. I never cared very much for BLUES, but Cyndi made me change my mind about it. She is so good singing it. After a great dance album she now gives us a great blues album. She keeps doing it over and over again. I love EARLY IN THE MORNING. What a great interpretation. I hope this coming THURSDAY (July 01) the BILLBOARD will list her record as one of the TOP 10 (she deserves to be one of the top 10). Cyndi Lauper, thank you so much for your support to the gay men community. Great summer album!
B0009A21R6|2.0|I'm finding out the hard way that 5.1 surround sound is only as good as the sound engineer who mixed it. As I invest in older CD's that I enjoyed in stereo, I'm finding out that I'm not always satisfied with 5.1 surround mix. \\"Brother's in Arms\\" is a great Dire Straits CD. It could have been even better in 5.1 surround, but the man at the sound board dropped the ball. I expect to become engulfed in the music, with sound coming from all around. Hence the term \\"Surround Sound\\". Well, that didn't happen, and after the first 2 tracks, I got bummed and listened to something else.    There is such a great opportunity to do something creative with surround sound, and that opportunity gets blown in the hands of the wrong person. I guess everyone has a different idea of what they expect to hear. In my opinion, Sting, Steely Dan, Bryan Ferry, (to name three) had their music mixed properly in 5.1 surround.
1577314808|5.0|I am still about 1/3 into the book, I'm taking it slow but it is very amazing. I made the mistake of trying to read his other book \\"A New Earth\\" before reading this and became lost, but The Power of Now lays everything out and explains what is a very complicated (although it doesn't have to be) concept. Would recommend to anyone who is curious about exploring themseleves and their thought patterns.
1401323820|5.0|This book was as much fun as any Castle episode.  Fans will really enjoy the read.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|All I can say is that I REALLY enjoyed the DVD's.  Joe is an amazing talent and it really shows through in his playing during the concert.  The only thing greater than his playing skills is his humbleness and humility.  Joe sounds truely greatful for the opportunities he's been given and his sucess hasn't gone to his head.  I like that. The world has enough conceited performers that act like whiney babies most of the time. Keep your head on straight Joe and keep playin' the blues!    The camera work on the DVD's is really cool.  There are at least 12 cameras so you continually get fresh views of the action with lots of close ups.  The production work is excellent.  It's better than a lot of other concert DVD's I have purchased. You will not be disappointed.    Well worth the money for any Joe Bonamassa fan.  My wife even enjoys watching it with me!    \\"EZ\\"  Ringgold, GA.
0812550706|5.0|I first read this book when I was ten.  I've read it probably a dozen times since then and it still is a great read.  In fact, it's gotten to the point that I can pick up the book (it's always laying around somewhere in our house as either I or my wife read it for the nth time), flip it open to a random page, and start reading from there.  And it's still great.  The book isn't \\"hard core\\" sci-fi in that the science part is not the core identity of the book.  Rather, the book's identity can be found in its characters - a group of super-genius children who are being trained to be the next generation of generals in an inevitable Third Invasion by the horrifically inhuman Buggers - and in its questions and moral quandaries.  This is a book that I took to giving to friends in high school who were self-proclaimed book-haters.  I thought this was a sad thing to be, so offered Ender's Game as an antidote to their ills.  They were uniformly against the idea...until I started offering $10 to anyone who didn't like it.  I started loaning the book over and over and over...and it never cost me a dime.  This is a wonderfully written, brilliantly paced, and indelibly moving story.  Groundbreaking in its day, it has since been classed as a YA novel, but the reality is that Ender's Game is a book for anyone from 12 to 1000.  And it will be a favorite for all ages THROUGH the ages because of it.
1439190275|5.0|I bought the new book and love it.  I'm not a huge meat eater. I've lost over 40 lbs on this diet. Vegetables are a mainstay of this diet. Yes, It does have protein and the good fats. Vegetarians eat a great deal of plant based protein. So this is great for them. The diet has helped bring down my blood sugars. If you're eating the good carbs described in this book, YOU WILL LOSE WEIGHT. I'm very thankful for this diet. There is a gentleman named T. Colin Campbell. Mr. Campbell wants everyone to write uncomplimentary reviews of this book. Sorry, Mr. Campbell. This book is the ultimate Atkins book.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I watched \\"Lost\\" for 6 years and like others, I got so wrapped up in it. Do I need to write about the past 6 years? No, we all know and saw what it was all about. The ending was partially satisfying but the writers could had tied up the end of the mysteries much better than they did. I was disappointed about that. All the cast members were fantastic! At least it was nice that at the end of the show they were all together and at peace. I loved & enjoyed watching this every week!!!!    I can not wait to see some of the actors from \\"Lost\\" on the new shows coming on this fall. Hopefully we will see \\"Jack\\" & \\"Sawyer\\" and others too. They were all great actors & actresses!!!!!!!!!
B001GCUO5M|2.0|\\"Shutter Island\\" is set in 1954 and the main character, Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former World War II soldier.  Teddy is now a U.S. Marshal that investigates the disappearance of a patient from a strange prison-like mental hospital on the rocky formidable East Coast Shutter Island.  The hospital is for the criminally insane.  Teddy is shown traveling on a boat to Shutter Island with his Deputy (Mark Ruffallo).  The waves and wind make him sick and he has to sit down when he reaches the office of the head of the institution. Ben Kingsley plays the man in charge and explains the radical treatments they perform here.  While Teddy is trying to get his \\"land legs\\" he is given a pill for headaches.<br /><br />Teddy has strange dreams, flashbacks, visions during his investigation and paranoia sets in that he is being drugged or poisoned.  Teddy quizzes the head of the institution along with most of the staff on the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted after she murdered her three children.<br /><br />The movie is filled with flashbacks, as you wonder why a U.S. Marshall was sent to such a place.  More and more psychological issues arise and Teddy suspects the authorities in charge are not telling him the truth.  The remote Ward C looms large in his mind, he thinks they are holding the arsonist who murdered his wife.<br /><br />Secrets are unraveled that Teddy fights hard not to believe.<br /><br />\\"Shutter Island\\" is not that engaging and the abundance of eerie visions end up being more of a sideshow.  It is a hard-to-believe premise for a story, but they try to give it weight by quoting German Concentration Camp and North Korean experiments with prisoners.  Overall, the movie was a psycho snore.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my Daughter and grandchildren. They liked it very much, but my son in law was really excited about it.  Its a great story told with excitement and immgination.  I recomment it for anyone that is a dreamer and wants to develop great things.

B0029LX2LC|5.0|I consider myself both a very tolerable yet critical Roots fan familiar with their entire body of work; I can definitely tell which tracks were from the heart and which one(s) are there for mainstream recognition. I have to say that when ?uestlove pulled this album the night before it was slated to drop last year and said that he wasn't happy with it yet my expectations rose almost as much as my anticipation. They exceeded my expectations.    Black Thought is spot-on...he spits potent, clever, lyrically-impressive genius. The guests on the album not only throw me back to some of the better guest performances from albums past but add to the overall quality and feel of the project. I also don't know how ?uesto managed to juggle his late-night gig with such perfectionist production.    Biased perhaps, but may I add that Doin' It Again is one of the best expansions on an awesome existing song I've ever heard.    Overall, Legendary.
B003RNXIBK|5.0|Marshall Mathers is back and better than ever!! He has cleaned up his act and has truly put his heart and soul into this album. If your an Eminem fan you definitely don't wanna miss out on this album.

0425166805|2.0|I really wanted to love this book as the concept has always intrigued me. The idea that ancient cultures demonstrated such incredible ingenuity and sophistication while supposedly being these technologically backwards civilizations simply doesn't make sense. And much of Daniken's book plays upon this premise.     While there is quite a bit of interesting information here, the impact of it is lost on the reader due to a lack of organization. The book was written in a train of thought methodology which is really not useful when you are trying to persuade an audience through the use of facts. Ideally I'd like to see this book arranged into chapters with each civilization being given it's own chapter and a breakdown of all of the historical anomalies analyzed.    Furthermore Daniken's analyses is commonly overenthusiastic and he rarely lets the evidence speak for itself. This becomes problematic if trying to use anything in the book as the basis or substantiation for some of these claims. And for those of you wanting to delve deeper into some of these historical anomalies, good luck finding them, as there are no references in the entire book.    I think it seems pretty clear that this book was originally geared towards the novice mind, as Daniken spends far too long expounding upon the possibilites of what could or couldn't have happened. Although interestingly enough he does describe something that is eerily similar to what we know today as the Internet. He discusses computer servers hosting volumes of information around the world all communicating with one another via radio waves. While not exactly accurate it made me pause for a moment to realize what a moment of predictive clarity this was.    Anyone interested in the subject might find some value in the information discussed, but to call this a serious archeological analysis is beyond far fetched. Organizational, narrative and overenthusiastic analysis problems detract from an impressive knowledge of ancient cultures. But if you do come away with anything from this book, it's that much of the archeological record is a mystery and that modern conjectures are almost just as fanciful as the author's inclination to believe that extraterrestrials visited ancient earth.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|My husband and I went to see Clash of the Titans with Krista and Corey yesterday and I loved it even more than I thought I would. It was so intense and I could not take my eyes off the screen. This is definitely a movie I will add to my collection.
0307387178|5.0|For some reason reading this book I thought of two famous quotes by Julius Caesar, the great Roman General: A coward dies a thousand deaths, a brave man but once(para-phrased by Shakespeare). A man who is not willing to lose everything, can never win everything.  While most of us may talk a good game, Chris had the courage and character to look for his own answers---to risk everything. In the book and movie, Chris is of this world, but certainly not in it. Rafting down the Colorado is both incredibly brave and incredibly dangerous. In the end, whatever mistakes Chris made he paid for in full. He owes no one any apologies or explanations. Occasionally, someone reached out and touched his heart, but he was still driven to find his answers. But some of the people who met him, knew him and loved him. And he died as any real man would want to, with his reach exceeding his grasp. I pay Chris the greatest complement I can: I like you Chris and if fate had given me the opportunity, I would been honored to number you among my friends, but only on your terms.

0843176717|5.0|The Roger Hargreaves, Mr. and Mrs. series, is fantastic for a four year old. Much before, they don't catch the humor, but my four year old grandson rolled with laughter every time I read one of the series. He has already highlighted the ones he wants for his next birthday, and the next etc...<br />These are great fun, and inexpensive.
B00005N5RM|5.0|The original was great. But, this one had so many more special effects. I is really a treat to watch.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I have always been cautious about movies that are over-hyped.  It seems that the more advertising and merchandising a movie has, the less I end up liking the movie.  When Avatar was first released, I thought the commercials were compelling, but the hype turned me off.  As a result, I did not see the film in the theatres.<br /><br />When the movie came out on DVD, I decided I needed to see it and decide for myself if the hype was worth it.  Live and learn.  I was blown away!  This was the most visually stunning film I have ever seen, and yet the plot, characters, and conflicts were equally stunning.  It makes me wish I had see the film in the theatrs to get the full experience in large scale.<br /><br />It's true that this edition does not contian any special features.  But, the quality of the DVD and the joy of owning the film itself is not diminished by this.  Some people may want to wait for future editions of the DVD, but I am perfectly happy just being able to watch this film over and over again.  After all, the real reason to buy a DVD is to own the film - the special features are just an added bonus.  I will be interested in seeing those special features when they are released, but until then I will continue enjoying this amazing piece of cinematic history.

B00000I0XW|4.0|Music was quite good, but a couple songs sung by Sarah Brightman did not sound as though she had the control of her voice as in later CDs.  The rest of the CD was fine.
B00005AWMF|5.0|You can't NOT like this album.  It's all the songs she's become so famous for.  The new album?  Time will tell.
0307275639|5.0|Recommend by a friend.  Glad I listened.  Makes me realize I need to focus on Life's Greatest Lesson more than I have.
B002ZG98J6|1.0|I saw this movie in theaters and I would hate for anybody to waste their money by buying this movie outright.  The storyline was rushed and absent any character development.  The acting was just atrocious, even laughable at times.  The token funny man's jokes fell flat and seemed forced.  Just a horribly put together movie.

B0000E6XH3|5.0|The Movie Is Very Creative, It Tells A Story Not With Words, But With Daft Punk's Music. It May Come Off Wrong To People Who're Not Really Into Musicals Or Animations, But If You're Into Daft Punk You'll Like How The Movie/Story Goes Along Well With The Tracks.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|I think the new band behind Ozzy has done wonders for this album. Every song is solid, with more than a couple standing out as winners. Sobriety hasn't slowed Ozzy down one bit, maybe it's even made him better. I've always thought Ozzy's vocals were his strong suit, and he shines on this album. Definitely one of his best in recent years. My favorites on the album are...all of them :)
B002GY9F9K|5.0|If you like fantasy, and especially if you like stories involving magic, witches, and wizards, you'll love this series.  I somehow didn't hear of it till the end of the second season, so I ordered the Season 1 DVD set.  I've watched the first 19 episodes so far, and the series is well done, with engaging actors and good special effects.  The commentaries included on the DVDs, which explain how some of the special effects are done and give tidbits about the actors, are an enjoyable bonus.
B0029LX2LC|4.0|Thank you gentleman for once again reiterating a sad fact of being the only true mainstream hip-hop artists around- this may just be the most creatively tight rap release since Aquemeni.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Loved it in the movie theater and love watching it at home. Having both Blu-Ray and DVD helps when my daughter is playing on the Play Station 3.
B003HE2B9E|4.0|I was disappointed when I learned that the new Believe (II) did not have Drive Away in the album. It is one of my fav track together with Bad News. However, I didn't hesitate to get my hands on this album after listening to the live version of Courage and Missing You (posted on Youtube). And there are new mixes for Bad News and Think Like A Man. As for the new songs, Courage is top of my list and Orianthi did a fantastic job on the classic Missing You. The surprise for me is Addicted to Love, which is something different from this repackaged rock-oriented album. All in, this ablum is still a good listen for anyone who wants to rock out.
B002ZG97RE|3.0|I was expecting a Bourne film which is MY OWN FAULT upon reading that this was made by the Bourne Ultimatum Director. It takes alot of twists and turns and you don't know who to like or who to trust! It has a good story but my major problem was with the filming! I think their approach was to make you feel as if you were there. I did not. I felt nausea and headache. All in all it's ok. The action sequences are good and it has some great Actors but this film just didn't do it for me for some reason. I would recommend watching it but can't recommend purchasing. Thanks for reading :)
0553582038|3.0|I echo what some others have said regarding this book:  it is the least of the series thus far.  The first two books grabbed the reader and the third was almost as good.  This book has a lot of filler, pointless dialogue, and not much \\"action\\".      Is it worth reading this series?  Sure.  I would call the series groundbreaking in its' treatment of the genre.  You will not find magic being flung about.  There is no scullery boy destined to be king.  There are no dragons...er..ok, there might be dragons.  In short, this series really strikes a chord with more mature readers and is definitely not your run of the mill \\"young adult\\" fantasy fare.  People try to compare this series to Tolkien which does it a dis-service.  It is as good as Tolkien, but not similar.    Should you buy this series and read it?  Well, that's a different question than the first.  The series is incomplete and those of us who are fans have waited too many years for the next installment.  I think this wait has been something like 5 years now.  That would not be that incredibly bad except for the fact that the future book, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", was supposedly mostly written when \\"Feast for Crows\\" was published.  Martin has spent the last four or five years re-writing and editing his \\"almost finished\\" book.  Several \\"deadlines\\" have been missed and Martin has stopped making any predictions on when the novel will be released.      Do not expect book five any time soon if history is any indication.  In that the series is supposedly going to be seven volumes, you might be looking at another decade for the series to be complete.  Only four books have been published, including the first which came out in 1996.  So that is a total of another three books in almost 15 years OR five years on average for each book.    For whatever my advice might be worth, I suggest just waiting it out.  If the series gets finished eventually, it will be worth the read.  If it never gets finished, you have saved yourself the time and money invested in a story with no resolution.    Why has the series taken this long to complete?  I don't know, no one can read the talented author's mind.  He does do many other projects and has other business distractions such as calendars, miniatures, role playing games, and a television mini series based on the series.  Maybe he understands that many see the last book as falling short of the mark set by the previous books and is hesitant to release the next in line.  In any event, do not expect to finish this series anytime in the next few years.    The sad thing is, the author is wonderfully talented.  He just does not seem to give the finishing of this project much attention.  Therefore, wait to read this series until it is finished.    Splitter

B00002SWEM|5.0|This is an excellent portrayal of the members of the Buena Vista Social Club musicians as told in their own voice. Viewers will hear many of the group's popular songs, get a bit of Cuban history, a chance to see rare footage of Havana, as well as a look inside the apartments where several musicians share their life story. This is an amazing DVD, one that viewers will enjoy watching again and again.
0545123275|1.0|I picked up this book hoping for some supernatural adventure and romance, but it left me confused and angry.  I'm not much for a critic (hey, i can't write) but this was bad.There is no good explanation on how this wolf thing works.   At first being a wolf is a wonder and a gift than it becomes a burden for the main characters,I think.  After the decision that the wolf thing is not a gift but a curse the lovers (main characters) are searching for a cure.  Spoiler alert: I don't think love is putting the one you love in life threatening situation (in this case poisoning him) for the off chance   that it may not kill him so you can get what you want while he sacrifices everything.Correct me if I'm wrong but that sounds very selfish.  I don't mind corny romance or not so deep romance but whatever was described in this book was not love in anyway.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|When you first listen to We Are Born you will quickly notice a departure from Sia's previous work. For the first time, Sia has released an album that you will want to dance to. This is not to say that this is a mindless pop album, but just simply a change of pace. Sia's incredible voice and song writing skills shine from start to finish, and that extra quirky Sia signature can be found throughout.<br /><br />If you're a Sia fan, you need to listen to this album with an open mind and I promise you'll thoroughly enjoy it. If you've never heard Sia's previous work, you will probably be one of the many new fans this album will surely attract.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Nothing like any of her older pop songs. She is past 50 and still sound really good.     If you like blues this is a good CD    Heard her on the Stern Show on Sirus and thought this would be good and it is.    MW
1416549447|1.0|Filled with a bunch of Chi Shmmee mystical crap.  Lots of BS filler to make it to the publisher's page quota.  I can summarize this book's running advice for you in two words.  LEAN FORWARD.<br /><br />Don't waist your money.
0061730327|5.0|If you think America has gone through tough times in recent years, you need to read this book.    I originally anticipated it being about the building of a homemade windmill... It does have to do with that, but it's so much more.  The backstory of how he got to that point is quite amazing.      This book is a real incite into African culture, and a great read from start to finish.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Product was great.  Just didn't have cover art.  sort of disappointing.  But fast shipping. :)
B002JMLMKE|5.0|I read this book when it was BRAND NEW and the religious world was going crazy. Look, its a good book, its fun, its adventerous dont see it as a threat to your faith.  Its just a book, entertainment, something to do when you just dont feel like doing anything.  Robert Langdon is a fantastic engaging character, after this book I took a step backwards and read Angels and Demons and then jumped into The Lost Symbol. The DaVinci Code is loaded with facts, but at the same time is loaded with Unsolved Mystery. Open your mind, say hmmm interesting and enjoy the adventure. My mother is devout Christian and she loved the book and it didnt change her faith in anyway.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I'm not going to waste space saying how big of a fan I am, or what's in my collection or any of that jazz other reviews are loaded with, rather, I'm going to cut to the chase. This DVD box set is a must for collectors and should be viewed by any self-professed Beatles maniac. It it rather long, and definitely feels like a documentary. There are some slow bits, and the songs and performances are mixed much louder than the spoken interviews but all are negligible to anybody who is interested enough in the Beatles to purchase this set. Casual fans stay away, and die-hards, if you don't have this already, buy it. My only wish is that it came with an extra disc containing all of the promotional films and performances in their entirety (like music videos) because they obviously cleaned up and restored all of them for the Anthology. But I guess those will be released eventually.
B000RZIGUY|5.0|I saw Face Off a few years back and never could get it out of my mind. Then I saw it again a couple of years ago and it still would  not get out of my mind.  So now I have it to watch all the time.  This is great--not only for the actors who play in it but the whole movie is about someone putting another persons face on them and the other person putting the first persons face on him.  Wild to say the least.  You get so caught up in this movie you forget who is who and get into the flow of the movie.  It carries you away and it is so good because there are not alot of movies now that really carry you away from reality.  I highly recommend this for an evening of really great action and it will keep you on the edge of your seat
0812973992|5.0|This novel was remarkable in so many ways. The authors passionate development of each character was as inspiring as his style of describing New York was breathtaking. Mr. McCann is an astounding talent and I look forward to reading everything he has or will pen. Heartbreaking and uplifting in the same breath...I enjoyed every minute of this book. It lingers with you and informs your sensibilities having read it. Thank you Mr. McCann!!!
0307454541|5.0|Given the popularity of the book and the number of truly outstanding reviews here, I'll forego the typical plot summary and instead focus on the elements of the book that warrant a five-star review.  The storyline is oblique - the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" creeps into the story by bits and pieces - she is in many ways, not really the protagonist, although she plays a crucial role in the story, and is a fascinating character.  The cast of other characters - Mikael Blomkvust, Lisabeth Salander, Erika Berger, Henrik Vanger - are each drawn with masterful detail. The number of intertwining plots - the murder mystery, the conviction of Blomkvist for libel, the sordid skeletons in the closet of the Vanger family - all kept me in rapt attention.  The red herrings tended to be a bit blatant, but the endings to each of the plots were suprising and tidily pieced together.  That Larsson was an investigative journalist before he began writing fiction is hardly suprising.<br /><br />There has been much buzz and attention drawn around Larsson (and his untimely death) and the series he has written; I had been skeptical of the merits of the books as a result.  However, I was very pleasantly suprised.  While the story takes a round-about way of getting the first act started (and laying the foundation for the plot), the payoff is worth the wait.  Highly recommended.
1401323820|4.0|This was a great read during the summer between television episodes.  I found the book different enough from the television series to make me read the material more carefully but similar enough that the chapters rolled along just like a prime time show!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I'm Not Much Of A Writer On Topics Like This Or Anything For That Matter.  Some People May Not Like This Movie, But If You Liked Any Other Movie Adapted From A Comic Book This One Is A Must See.  There Are Not That Many Heroes From The Comics That Do Not Have Superhuman Abilities.  Batman, Daredevil, And Iron Man Are The Three That Come To Mind And To Overcome Evil With Only Gadgets And Skill Is Impressive.  Even Though It Has Been Said That Iron Man Did Not In Many Ways Stay True To The Comics It Is Still An Entertaining \\"Marvel\\".  No Pun Intended, Being That Iron Man Was Published By Marvel Comics.  I Don't Want To Get Into Detail About What The Movie Is About, Just Keep In Mind That The First Of Every Comic Adapted Into A Movie Tells A Back Story Of How The Title Character Became Who They Were Intended To Be, Thus There Are A Few Slow Moments.  However There Are Enough Special Effects And Comic Book Action To Be Entertained.  Blu-Ray Is How Iron Man Was Intended To Be Viewed With Intense Visual Clarity And Dynamic Sound.  I Hope This Helps And Enjoy.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am 250 pounds but in pretty good shape, even for my weight. I popped this in just today. I got to the squat and press with no trouble, but for some reason that hurts my right thigh so bad that i cant even hardly move it! so im gonna sit for a while and try it again later, but use my shake weight instead of the squat and press until my thighs can handle it. Besides that, it is a nice, full workout. Enjoyable. I like jillian because she isn't so perky. Sharp and to the point. The workout did not challenge me except for the pushups and the squat and press
0316067598|5.0|This book is well written and shows the courage and might of American fighting soldiers in the face of horrible odds. We should proud of our Armed Forces and support them. This book is a wake-up call to Patriotism as good as any I have read.
B001O6W9QC|1.0|As comedies go, Tropical Thunder makes Porky's II look like something by Noel Coward.  Embarrassingly tasteless and unimaginative.  Not even the magnificent Robert Downey, Jr. can save it.<br /><br />Horrible through and through, from the script to the direction to the cast (excepting Downey).  I'm still looking for someone who can explain why Ben Stiller and Jack Black are successful film comedians.  Neither is a bit funny.  Stiller looks okay, I guess, especially considering who his parents are, but Black doesn't have good looks or anything else going for him.  He's like John Belushi without the talent.<br /><br />Don't even slow down to glance at this dead skunk.<br /><br />Jeff Huber
B001C4AFOY|4.0|I avoid \\"romantic\\" comedies and other chick flicks like the plague because they are very rarely romantic.  But I do love period movies, especially concerning the British monarchy (in particular the Tudors).  I am only a little familiar with Queen Victoria, so I thought this film would be a great way to learn more about her.  I never expected such a beautiful romance to be the heart of this film - truly a love story!  That it is a true story makes it all the more compelling.  Certainly, the filmmakers took some liberties and invented some scenes which historians cannot verify, but that they loved each other is not in doubt.  After his early death, she remained in mourning for most of her very long reign.<br /><br />I agree with the majority of reviewers here: the setting, costumes and language are all astonishing.  The acting is top notch, in particular the two stars.  However, I also agree that the film could have had more substance to fulfill the romance.  We see them fall in love, and her initial struggles finding her place as Queen, but I would have liked to see more of their work together that made her reign such a memorable, and eponymous time.  However, the title is \\"The Young Victoria\\" and much of that happened later.  They lay the foundation, and let history be the rest of the tale.  That is not to say the film has no story or plot.  The film does a good job of revealing the political machinations that embroiled her early days as queen, as she struggled to learn which advisers to trust, and the consequences of her actions.  Also well done was how Albert became the constant in her life upon which she could rely.<br /><br />Overall, though more substance between the couple would have been welcome, it wasn't absolutely necessary.  Viewers aren't promised something that is never delivered.  A wonderful film that I highly recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have since purchased the DVD and found it to be a great complement to the film.  Many single disc editions skimp on extras, if they offer them at all.  Though the featurettes here are brief (perhaps 10 minutes each), they add something to the overall film - especially helpful in knowing who's who and their place in the story.  In particular, \\"The Real Queen Victoria Featurette\\" was clever in quoting from Victoria's actual diaries to provide a mini-documentary.  The crown jewel here, however, is the deleted/extended scenes. There are quite a few, and most could easily have stayed in the film though I understand why they were cut.  Many of these scenes concern the Lady Flora Hastings scandal of Victoria's early reign (you can read more on wikipedia about it), which while interesting and historically accurate, would have taken away from the love story the film was trying to tell.ffer them at all.

0307463745|5.0|I read this book a while ago on the recommendation of a friend.    Although the information is not necessarily new, the application and method of presenting is excellent.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|Eminem has recovered finally.      After being on record pretty much trashing his last album Relapse, the stanbase got offended by my comments.  I stated basically that Eminem had shown no growth in his 5 year hiatus and relied on weak gimmicks to get by.  Well well well, what a difference a year makes huh????      On Relapse, one of the final songs on the album was Beautiful which was a beautifully written testimonial that was a stark contrast to the rest of that garbage album (hey Eminem said it himself).  It's no surprise that Recovery follows in that same vein with the overall vibe of this album.  Another positive of this album is the switch in production.   Dr. Dre only produces 1 song and thank the lord for that.  I'm not knocking his legacy I'm just saying his beats in the last few years have been far less than spectacular.  Also the change in production style seemed to light a fire underneath Eminem instead of being comfortable and going through the motions like he seemed to do on Relapse.  With producers such as Just Blaze, Boi 1da and DJ Khalil amongst others, this album undoubtedly provides a different direction than previous album.    Eminem definitely delivers lyrically as well but that should be no surprise.  He's back to doing what he was meant to do and that's dish out warnings and clever quips in a battle type style.  There are no ridiculous over the top songs that warrant a skip (well maybe WTP but even that isn't that bad).  Every track is a good track.    Eminem also ventures out by featuring Pink & Rihanna on his album.  Most people didn't know this but Pink started out as an R&B singer.  However on this album she blesses a pseudo rock track that in my opinion definitely works.  These two have nice chemistry to me and I wouldn't be surprised if they have recorded several other songs together.  Rihanna also injects a unique energy to Love The Way You Lie that on paper doesn't seem like it would work but works beautifully.      Simply put, Eminemhas righted every wrong from his previous two albums.  He has \\"Recovered\\" by learning from his mistakes and sticking to what made him so loved while also successfully updating his sound and branching out.  While Relapse was worst album of the year material, Recovery is undoubtedly album of the year material. Eminem raps with precision, skill, and a wealth of content never before heard on any of his other albums. This is the album we've been looking for for a long minute and I urge hip hop fans to go out and support good music.  4.5 stars.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|This album rocks steady from beginning to end, and that's just the way I like it. There is no filler here in my opinion, each and every song is pretty much rock solid. I was so impressed by it all that I will say that Scream is probably Ozzy's best album in over a decade. I really do think that it is that good, and I enjoyed Ozzy's last CD Black Rain very much.<br /><br />The new guy, Gus G., is a really great guitarist and adds some fresh new blood to the Ozzy sound on this release. Zakk is great also and of course will be missed, but fear not, he has a new Black Label Society album coming out soon and from the sounds of the song Parade of the Dead, it sounds pretty good so far.<br /><br />There's not much more to add except to say that if you liked Ozzy's last few albums, it's pretty safe to say that you will probably enjoy this one as well. Keep on Rockin', Ozzy! I love you, Man!<br /><br />Standout Tracks are: Let it Die, Let Me Hear You Scream, Soul Sucker, Life Won't Wait, Diggin' Me Down, Fearless, I Want it More.

Anyway, this CD took us back to that great concert! Can't say enough about the music! The CD is in a nice cardoard case that opens up. Hubby is a fan of the old Credence group, and he LOVED this one!

B003A4IFGY|5.0|For those of you who hated Echo and thought Highway Companion was just alright this album will bring back some faith in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  The guitar work on the album is outstanding and the over all musical talent on this album stands out from their latest work.  Instead of just producing an album to make their fans happy Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers played music with actual spirit.  For the most part I enjoy every song on this CD.  Tom Petty and Heartbreakers out did themselves on this album and I'm glad to see they have some soul back in their music.
030726999X|4.0|This is the final book of the Larsson trilogy,  It pulls all the pieces of the puzzle in their place  in a  masterful way. It is unfortunate that he has left us, i would have thoroughly enjoyed reading everything he would continue to write.<br />The book came quickly and was in pristine condition except for a big tear on the book jacket (who cares) Being in a mystery solving mode I wondered how it got there? Steig where are you when I need you?
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|This is the third time I've purchased this album; once, in the 70s in vinyl (I was but a 10 year old when this was first released, so didn't buy it until a few years later).  Then, again as a CD in the late 80s.  As far as I was concerned, it was always a great album.  But then, someone stole all the CDs out of my car a few years ago, and I never got around to replacing them.  Till now.  Glad I waited!  The 2009 remastering sounds wonderful!  I am not going to rehash anything about the music itself, I don't think I could add anything.<br /><br />About the materials, however, at first I was put off by the cardboard wrappings of this as opposed to a plastic jewel case, but then, as I removed the wrappings to get to the inner CD, I was reminded of the original vinyl album!  Another unexpected treat was the mini documentary that opens up when you put the CD into your computer to download it!  What a treat.
B0030E1XJU|1.0|My son had a stomach virus and we couldn't go see the movie as planned so I bought the toy for him as a surprise the next day.  How disappointing.  The toy wasn't much fun without the other sets attached.  It also didn't include the pig, so for the basket jump I purchased the slinky dog and dinosaur separately as the store didn't have the pig in stock. Unfortunately, the dinosaur didn't fit in the basket and the slinky dog didn't jump well.      My son turns 5 in less than 3 weeks, so since the label says 5 to 7, I thought that the toy would be an appropriate play toy for him.  However, even I had a hard time attaching Woody and the big baby to the assembly since I had to fit the tiny hole in their feet to a tiny little peg on the swing and the zip car. I also had a hard time figuring out how to keep the car from slipping down the zip line before we were ready to start as the piece didn't automatically lock in place.  I eventually learned that if I added pressure on the back side of the hook and pushed down the swing would stay put; however, there was no mention of this on the instruction sheet.      My son also had trouble putting the wooden swing back on the zip line since it fell off every time with Woody attached.  As a result, he grew very frustrated while trying to set up the action link.  I thought about putting the toy away for a few months but I couldn't take the toy back apart without causing damage.  I also noticed that there is a stress mark on the plastic zip line after one afternoon of play so I don't think this toy will last more than a few days at most.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|Rappers are not supposed to get better over time. They either stay the same or get worse. Eminem is getting better! This newest album shines the improvement of his flow and the slicing edge of his punchlines. If you are a fan of Eminem's work this album should be a no brainer.
B0034JKZ86|3.0|The movie wasnt as good as I thought it would be, but the kids like it.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|What a great revisit for Devo fans. Just a fun album to listen to. Clean ol' good ol' rock and roll... evolved.
0143034901|5.0|I've read this twice - it's one of the best written and interesting stories ever. One can re-read it just to enjoy the use of language and word selection. Can't wait to read his new novel.
B003HFFVEA|4.0|Other reviewers will weigh in on the album.  It's like Lemon Jelly on (more?) LSD.  I want to focus on the DVD.  The visuals are interesting, and the \\"making of\\" was great to watch.  The problem is with the sound encoding.  Despite dolby digital 5.1 and dts audio being printed on the packaging materials, the DVD only contains one audio track, stereo.  Not a huge problem, but I wouldn't have purchased the DVD if I had known that.  iTunes has the same stuff in the \\"Further\\" pass, which I bought first.  I ordered the physical product for 5.1/dts on the DVD.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|one of the best series on FX-- Katy S. is brilliant--good comparison is the Sopranos on motorcycles--only complaint is the LONG overdue release date for season 2(Sept.14 after season 3 begins)
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This controller is exactly what I have been looking for months now. I tried Ebay but the two i bought from there were NOT what they were advertising. When I came across this controller on amazon I was a little sketchy as to buy it, so i took a shot. When the controller arrived it was exactly what they advertised in picture and description. It works perfectly and I  have had no troubles with it. it also shipped out quite fast! very happy with this and suggest everyone else use this product!
B00005NTJM|4.0|Jethro Tull's first album comes OH so close to being a really brilliant debut album.   One song in particular drags down an otherwise incredibly heavy and production-spectacular (hey, it *sounds* really cool as well) late 60's rock album.    As far as vocal melodies go (and particularly Ian Anderson's distinct vocal range) \\"My Sunday Feeling\\" and \\"Beggar's Farm\\" have brilliant vocal melodies.  Ian Anderson already sounds mature and apparently knew exactly what kind of vocal style he was going for right from the beginning (that being... who knows?  A blend of blues, folk, and hard rock I suppose).    At the very end of side one, you get to experience another important element of Jethro Tull's style- the flutes!  \\"Serenade to a Cuckoo\\" has a flute jam that sounds very very different compared to everything else at the time.  I don't know what to think about a song like this to be perfectly honest.  The flutes are definitely the most important part, and they win me over.  That's a fact.     \\"Dharma for One\\" starts off on an incredible note, but a minute later the song morphs into a drum jam for a couple minutes.  At least this drum solo is better than most (I'm looking at YOU... everyone else back then, hehe).    Remember I said in the opening line that one song drags the rating down one point?  Well it's the follow-up \\"It's Breaking Me Up\\".  It seriously sounds like a poor man's Cream to me (something Uriah Heep was guilty of from their debut as well).  The vocals, the flutes, and the guitars all sound very bland to me.  Pure filler.    But you will COMPLETELY forget all about that once you hear \\"Cat's Squirrel\\". WOW WHAT A JAM, haha.  *This* my friends, is how you create a blues jam.  Move over Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin (or not, since it resembles both of those bands pretty closely).  Every single note must have been inserted into some kind of melody machine.  It's just a brilliant song from beginning to end.      \\"A Song for Jeffrey\\" seems to be an influence forLed Zeppelin one short year later.  A song like this (if we ignore the flutes) could have fit perfectly on Zeppelin's debut album.      Overall, I love this album, and I highly recommend you purchase this baby as soon as possible.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|It is the best Pink Floyd experience I have ever had. Just sit back and be thoroughly entertained.
B000TENN2E|2.0|I really don't get Queensryche.  I'll be the first to admit it.  Their music just sounds incredibly generic and secondrate to me, making other heavy metal acts such as Metallica and Iron Maiden look like the true geniuses they are.    The problem lies in the bands ability to write songs, or rather inability.  They can't write them, or at least, not in a satisfying or creative way.  Just in a generic, dumbed down kind of way with a lead singer who can't sing memorable vocal melodies.    The \\"Sister Mary\\" suite is probably the poorest excuse for a multi-part sophisticated metal song I've ever heard.  The vocal melodies are mediocre at best, and they offer absolutely nothing in the way of creativity or originality.  The entire 10-minute suite doesn't offer hardly anything at all, in fact.  No amazing guitar solos, no exceptional songwriting to speak of, and certainly nothing to really entertain me.  Just... good lyrics I suppose, and nothing more.    I used to think Operation: Mindcrime was a significant improvement over Empire, but I'm not so sure now.  Both albums are fairly even.
0446691437|5.0|I want to challenge the good folks out there who regard themselves as Christians and followers of Christ, myself included, to read this book. Though this book is not 'Christian' per-say, it is filled with good stuff.  It will challenge your 'religious paradigm thinking' and get you back into a 'relationship paradigm experience' with Christ. Pressfield 'binds the strongmen' of; status-quo, the mundane, and fears of all kinds to allow for greater release of your already God given giftings, talents, longings, and passions already placed in you through the 'inheritance of the saints'. The 'religious Christian' has long gone to sleep and lost their joy in living. No wonder our youth are drawn to the occult and the supernatural outside of the realms of His Spirit. We Christians have too often snuffed out and squelched His Spirit within us such that He has not room to breathe nor space to move. Pressfield awakens the...'Christ in you the hope of Glory'. Go for it, trust the Holy Spirit to guide you into all truth through the reading. You'll be amazed. In closing, for some of you religious/proper Christian types, get over the a-- word on the cover. Read the Gospels and try to tell me Jesus didn't kick some a--, He did, and then some.
B000023VR6|5.0|I am so happy to have this back. Been looking for this for 2 years. and i thank the person for it, very fast service and a big smile here.I ordered on sunday and received it on tuesday. very fast service and great condition, better than i expected.

B0029LX2LC|5.0|The Roots have always been one of those bands who I always respected but never fully enjoyed.    They had the chops. Black Thought was is perfectly proficient MC. In that they are an actually hip hop band on a major label, they have their own unique lane. Yet, none of the Roots' previous albums never truly moved me. Similar to the Brand New Heavies, the Roots, while technically gifted, sounded too practiced. For a live band, their music rarely sounded spontaneous or organic. Instead, it sounded overly rehearsed and over considered. As if every micrometer of the album's sound was heavily thought about. (If you ever read any of the fascinatingly brainy interviews with the band's leader, drummer Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson, you'd see that it was.) Music is supposed to come from the heart, not solely from the mind.     So although, all nine of the previous Roots LPs were musically impressive, they lacked a lot of soul.     Until...How I Got Over.    This album is such a pleasant surprise. Not only is it instantly captivating and beautifully produced, it's the first album by the Roots that actually has sheer emotion. Not well-thought ideas but genuine feeling. Not only does it sound good, it FEELS good.    How I Got Over is a seamless listen that must be listened to in it's full 42 minute rotation. The album finds the band in a morosely reflective mood. It's the aural equivalent of a man, on the verge of entering another stage of his life (in interviews, Thompson says that stage is entering the fellas entering their 40s), giving himself a deep, hard stare in the mirror. Reflecting his past and pondering his future and wondering where his place is in the world. This deep introspection is achieved by mood and texture, not heavy-handed thought, which makes HIGO even more powerful and intoxicating.    As with the more recent Roots releases, How I Got Over features an eclectic guest list, including career-long affiliates like Dice Raw, underground hip hop geniuses like LA's Blu and North Carolina's Phonte (of Little Brother and Foreign Exchange fame) and indie rock sensations the Dirty Projectors (the ladies in that band give a beautiful performance on HIGO's intro), Jim James and Joanna Newsom (via a sample) as well as R&B crooner John Legend. Yet all the guests flow beautifully with the album's groove. They only add to the album's brilliance, not interfering with it.    How I Got Over is a must-have. It's easily one of the best albums of the year and the new decade. A beautiful album from a band that finally freed their mind and let the groove (and emotions) follow.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I normally don't watch things twice but I had watched this series on Discovery with Sigourney Weaver as the narrator.    This set has Richard Attenborough as the narrator, but I liked Weaver better.    I will likely never get to almost any of the places shown so I now will be able to 'go' again, and learn more, any time I want.    I gave 5 stars because of the content and the extras.  There was additional content that the Discovery version didn't have.    Attenborough does a great job of narrating, and more people may enjoy his narration, but my personal preference was Weaver and she doesn't narrate this extended version.

B003HLM2QO|4.0|Scream has a strong, dynamic sound running throughout, from start to finish.  Ozzy's vocals are still really good...after all these years, his voice remains magnetic.  This time around there is a bit of a gutteral yell mixed in with his singing.  I guess this feature has been featured here and there in past albums, but is definitely more prominent here.  It gives \\"Scream\\" attitude.  The band sounds really good...the new guy is not much of a departure from Zakk...in my opinion.  The dude can shred with gusto.    As far as individual songs are concerned...\\"Scream\\" sounds arena ready.  For some reason, it just strikes me as a song to be featured in a WWF match.  But, it's still a good song.    The gem on here is \\"Life won't wait\\".  If this isn't released as a single, it would be a great disservice.      \\"Digging me down\\" has a strong sinister riff, but doesn't really go anywhere interesting.    Another standout track is \\"Time\\".      One complaint is how LOUD it plays on stereos.  Oh well, it's become common with newer hard music releases.    This is a good album for any Ozzy fan to add to their collection!
0380973839|4.0|The Martian Chronicles is a collection of loosely related short stories. The stories are often grim depicting racism, greed and other issues like mans imperialistic nature.    You have to go into this book willing to suspend your belief. Mars is not depicted as the red, barren planet that we know of today. Also, a lot of the plot elements are quite far-fetched, such as a group of average people being able to secretly build a rocket that travels to Mars, or a character that is able to build robots that are copies of humans in just about every way (speech, movement, etc) in a very short period of time. There are many far-fetched ideas strung throughout.    I have to admit when I first started this book I thought it was ridiculous and way too far-fetched. However, as I kept digging in and just accepted this book for what it is I started reading for the underlying message rather than trying to pick the book apart. Once I took a more open-minded approach the book really started to shine. By the time I reached the middle of the book I was finding it increasingly harder to put down.    The Martian Chronicles is currently my favorite Bradbury book which I highly recommend; you just have to be willing to open your mind a bit. If you are stuck on hard sci-fi then this book is probably not for you.
B001EP8EL2|5.0|I have to say, there's apparently a very special effort put into sci-fi on blu ray. My three favorite sci-fi movies ever (2001, Blade Runner, The Man Who Fell to Earth) are possibly three of the best looking discs in my collection.    For those unfamiliar with the movie, it's essentially David Bowie playing himself. That is to say, he's playing an alien. Suffice to say, it comes very natural to him.    It's a story about a man who falls to earth, on a journey to save his home planet and family from drought. But that's not what the movie is about. The movie is about the universality of the human condition. Every creature in this galaxy is a sucker for sex drugs and rock and roll, and we don't have to feel bad about what we perceive as human weaknesses because it is not specific to humans. At one point, David Bowie reassures a character that they don't have to feel bad about the way Bowie's character is being treated as a visitor to earth, as a human visitor to Bowie's planet would receive the same treatment.    The way the film is directed and shot places great emphasis not only on the characters and story, but on the feeling. The strange world created by Roeg and company is exhaustingly surreal. We feel like visitors to an alien world, one that is uncomfortably familiar. Watching this decently long movie almost becomes difficult. The destruction of standard linear storytelling combined with the brilliant landscapes and imagery strike a certain chord that resonates pure strangeness.    This being a Criterion release, everything about the package itself is top notch. It comes in a pretty little cardboard package that folds open once and gets slid inside a slip case. The art is gorgeous all around. The booklet, a standard inclusion in Criterion releases, provides the usual information about the production of the film, more great artwork, an essay analysis about the film, and a poem about the original Boy Who Fell to Earth, Icarus. If anybody in the universe puts as much love into anything as Criterion puts into their releases, I would be amazed.    The transfer itself is fantastic, of course. The film is presented in what is unarguably Roeg's original vision, and preserves the grain and softness present in the original photography. That is how all releases should be handled. Not every movie on blu ray needs to look like Speed Racer. Of course, detail gets a very nice boost and the image is slightly sharper than it ever was on DVD. Look no further than the DVDBeaver review for great examples. Look at Bowie's hair and the fountain in the screenshots provided.    A 5/5 package if there every was one. A great movie, a great package, and a great presentation by the greatest film company in the world.
B000AP04L0|2.0|I do not for the life of me understand all the hype surrounding this movie. Why does everyone love \\"Office Space\\" so much? There were a few times when I chuckled here and there, but overall this movie just is NOT funny. I do not recommend it.

B00337KMAA|4.0|Simply narrated movie, a good story done in rich context, sharp directing with powerful performances by the lead trio, Clooney, Kendrick, Farmiga.  Production is excelent, a bit too much of A.A. in my opinion but it somehow fits the movie.  Blu-Ray disc has very few extra features and that's the downside. The image of course is spetacular!  Worth checking the deleted scenes because they really give a wider perspective on the main character.

0375429743|4.0|A very good book for TOEFL preparation. Given excellent directions how to pass the exam and precise tips. Only 1 minus - it IS iBT, you must be sure what kind of test you're going to take.
B00005JLK1|3.0|More of a buy for my wife because she likes this movie, I enjoyed the graphic scenes and the twist at the end.  Just as the title says, it's a \\"lost\\" ship that has a horrible history and is told through encounters with the ghosts of the victims.  If it were not for the good production value and certain actors the bulk of the movie would be a one-watch view.  An average 3 out of 5 stars.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I became a Josh Groban fan after I saw him in concert for his first album. When his follow-up album, Closer, came out, I rushed to go buy it. Overall, Closer is an amazing album. This album totally exceeded my expectations of him and his music. He is unlike any singer in this world. Josh Groban just keeps on improving even when we fans may think he reached his limit. All the music on this album is so strong and inspirational! For example, \\"My Confession\\" and \\"You Raise Me Up\\" give off an enchanting and rich tone of meaning in both its lyrics and music. His music reminds me not to take anything for granted. Even if I don't understand his non-English music, I can still feel the passion that he brings. When I listen to this album, it feels like I am taking one step \\"Closer\\" to him.
B0039TD826|5.0|Hey Rolling Stones Fans: Everything and anything Posotive you have read about this CD is TRUE. This is complete CLASSIC. Nevermind anything negative anyone has had to say about this classic gem. The new remastering is awesome, sound is crystal clear. No it's not too \\"tinny\\" or \\"bassy\\" sounding....if anyone thinks that way, they need to invest in a new Stereo. Great CD at a Great price...i recommend it to anyone, I can't stop playing it!!

1400067936|2.0|Taleb is a disagreeable former options trader who has made a second career of being a guru. He certainly doesn't want to be a trader again.<br /><br />It is said that if you do something you love you will never work a day in your life. Taleb developed a way to trade options that was uniquely unpleasant. He hated it and was showing signs of stress in the form of tics and other mannerisms. We know this because Malcolm Gladwell published an essay on Taleb while he was still trading.<br /><br />Taleb's insight was that risk distributions have \\"fat tails\\" not the rapidly diminishing tails of Gaussian distributions. This means that rare events are quite a bit less rare than many suppose. He calls these rare events - Black Swans. His later and much better book is in fact called The Black Swan. Skip this one and read that one.<br /><br />As it happens his use of the term Black Swan is inapt. Black Swans are not rare. Last weekend I ate lunch outside at a restaurant with a pond. They had both black and white swans. All Australian swans are black. Before Australia was fully explored there had been philosophical discourse on the possibility of the existence of black swans - only white ones had ever been seen up to that point. John Stuart Mill and David Hume had engaged in these musings about the limits of inductive reasoning. Mill actually entertained the possibility of the existence of black swans because they would be so little different from the common white ones. So as a metaphor for extreme rarity and the limits of inductive reasoning, the black swan notion doesn't really mean what Taleb what thinks it does.<br /><br />Taleb devised a method to avoid \\"blowing up\\" - that is losing everything because of a rare market downturn - what he calls a black swan. Indeed he found a way to profit from these rare catastrophic financial events. But it is not a formula that many will find attractive. First of all he never invested all his money. He only engaged a part of his bankroll, so that he could never be totally broke. The second thing he did was to trade such that he only won when an unexpected downturn occurred. His financial position was such that on normal days he lost but on that inevitable blow up day when everyone else went bust he would clean up. In practice this meant that he was a loser day after day for months or years. Then when the bad day came he finally made a profit. He was miserable almost all of the time and only happy for one day every couple years. Gladwell comments on how crazy this strategy made him.<br /><br />If you want to understand the Taleb Black Swan phenomenon it is better to just read the Google article on \\"Fat Tails\\". You won't have to endure Taleb's wrongheaded ideas about frequency distributions or his all consuming self absorbtion. Taleb is an intellectual idea dropper who quite often gets the idea a little wrong. This was his first guru book. As such it has less content than his magnum opus The Black Swan.<br /><br />In both of his books he recounts anecdotes about how those around are always angry with him. This rings true. I've never met the man but still I hate him.o that he could never be totally broke. The second thing he did was to trade such that he only won when an unexpected downturn occurred.

0470449756|5.0|This is a good book with complete sets of exercises, but it would be better to buy the one with Math exercises (the purple one). Even if you don't intend to do Math exercises, it is good to read and understand the test techniques.
0385341008|5.0|As this novel is written mostly as various letters, it is up to the reader to figure out the background behind the letters.  What are the letter writers responding to?  If you can figure this out, you will find this a delightful read; if you expect the book to be more direct, you won't know what is going on.<br /><br />The humor mostly comes from the British quality of understatement.  I giggled throughout the book and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The humor balances the powerful drama of characters who quietly battled the terrors of Nazi occupation of their island home.<br /><br />If you don't believe a good work of literature can have a happy ending, don't read this.
B002ZRPQ5K|3.0|I love Keane. They got everything a band needs: Talent, songwriting skills, and the power to move the listener. Keane's albums moved me in a way I can't explain.    This album wasn't so good. Neither was the \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" album.    Actually, those albumks were good. But not as good as they could've been, considering who we're talking about here.    Keane, you let me down a little bit. But there's always a next record.
B00110K62U|5.0|Outstanding performance.  Although in Concert form it is as good as the original musical on stage.  Buy it.  If you're a Les Miz fan, you'll never tire of it.
B003A4IFGY|4.0|Because I didn't like that 2002 album, whatever it was called. I got the \\"Live Anthology\\" box set because I thought Tom Petty did a good live show and I wanted to hear it. It was an ultimate live album.    Then I heard Tom Petty was releasing a new studio album. When I heard that, I thought, \\"Oh, God. I hope it doesn't suck.\\" It didn't!    This album proves that Tom Petty still rocks! Especially when he's a Heartbreaker.
B000MV90F8|5.0|Very Good Movie.  I have the set and I have enjoyed watching it.  I would recommend this movie highly to anyone
B0039TD7RC|5.0|I'm a sucker for classic bands like the Rolling Stones. I always thought their best album was \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" It's a classic! And now the tracks are remastered and sound great! And some outtakes and more extras on a second disc! That's great! I totally love this album, and now I love it even more!
B000062XGJ|5.0|Visual dynamics are the highlight in this movie about an invisible alien hunter stalking soldiers on assignment in the jungle lands of Central America.  Colorized gradations for the heat vision of the alien, the alien's transparent body perfectly embracing the nearby jungle, and the plasma blasts from the alien's shoulder-mounted swiveling weapon lighting up the night all combine for a stunning novel viewing experience.  Stan Winston and his staff also did a great job in creating the ferocious alien form.
B003JYOFIW|4.0|And they didn't need to take several albums to \\"whip themselves into shape.\\" This album's already classic Devo. I still notice the similarities between this album and their classic albums such as \\"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\\" and \\"Freedom of Choice.\\"    I can't tell what my favorite songs are, because they're all so catchy and great.    My Mom bought this album for herself. I checked it out to see why the hell she bought an album with a cover showing a woman eating a cherry. I thought it was wrong. But the music was right on!    In conclusion, buy this album or you will never have a life!
B003HLM2QO|5.0|This album rocks from start to finish!! It also includes some of the darkest material of his career. The opener, \\"Let It Die\\" is bone-crushing along w / \\"Diggin' Me Down\\", \\"I Want It More\\", etc. He's also once again very adept at the killer balads!! \\"Life Won't Wait\\" is just incredible, and Blasko's Bass line is perfect!    Gus G. was a cool choice for a new guitar player, and I get the sense that he's classically trained like Randy which says a great deal!! Also, being a fan of Firewind I've always liked his riffs. I love Zakk too, but change in this case is good!! Let us not forget the other half of the Rob Zombie rythmn section, Tommy Clufetos!! Great drummer!!    Outstanding album, and his best since \\"Ozzmosis\\"!! The Ozzman cometh back!!!
B003AO1SVS|4.0|This is a great album. One of the best I've heard this year. It's almost as good as the \\"Attack & Release\\" album, which was their best album ever. This album comes close to being the Black Keys' best album.

It was shipped in wonderful condition and it came in a very timely manner. It is so fun to watch in blu-ray! And I really like that it has extras and extra disc versions in this set. I would definitely recommend this product for someone special or even for you!
B003HE2B6C|3.0|I think it was just yesterday when it was 1997. I was 2, Mom was 32 and she fell in love with those guys. I was too young to understand, but I found out while looking through Mom's old records and found Hanson.    Now, I got their new album. It's okay. It's awfully cute watching those teen rock stars grow up into R&B-rock bands. It's like watching your kid go to college.
B003102JDM|3.0|I'd already seen the film in the theater. I liked the extra features. Unfortunately the disc arrived with a scratch .Except for that problem I'm pleased. As the film says at the beginning__ 'Accept everything that happens to you with simplicity.' Rashi
B003C1QIO6|4.0|This album is cool. Which is rarely heard when I'm talking about a Jack Johnson album. But I heard his new single \\"You and Your Heart,\\" and I thought he would put out something really really really good finally. And he did! The album is awesome! Acoustic guitars are flawless, his vocals are perfect! This album will be a classic!
B003K025V4|3.0|For this review, I will be rating each track as I listen to it for the first time with the exception of the lead single \\"Can't Be Tamed\\". This review applies to the standard version of the album.    1. Liberty Walk (3 stars) - My one wish for Miley is for her to break away from her Radio Disney roots. Unfortunately, this song does not accomplish that goal.    2. Who Owns My Heart (3 stars)- Once again this is very Radio Disney. In fact, aside from some suggestive innuendo, this is almost straight up a Hannah Montana song. Also, is it just me or does Miley sound about 12 in this song?    3. Can't Be Tamed (5 stars)- This song is reminiscent of two pop greats: Britney Spears and Lady GaGa. God, I love this song.     4. Every Rose Has It's Thorn (5 stars) - Okay, I sure ten million Poison fans will want to shoot me and Miley in the face, but I actually think this is a very well crafted remake.    5. Two More Lonely People (5 stars) - Words and lyric wise, this song seems to be better suited to either Celine Dion or Cher. With that said, Miley knocks it out of the park on this track. This should definitely be a single.    6. Forgiveness And Love (3 stars) - This is a hard call. I really want to like this song, but to me, it seems pitchy at times.    7. Permanent December (1 star) - This sounds like really, really, I mean really bad Europop.    8. Stay (2 stars) - This track tries real bad hard to be an emotional ballad. Maybe it's because I am not a teenage girl, but it never gets off the ground for me. It just kinda lays flat.    9. Scars (2 stars) - This is just a filler track. No connection at all from me.    10. Take Me Along (3 stars) - For Miley's age (17), she does really well with these lyrics. However, I felt she could have taken this song one step further    11. Robot (4 stars)- Could this be a stab at The House of Mouse???    12. My Heart Beats For Love (5 stars) - This is a very mature song. Who knew that Miley had it in her. I am a bit shocked. I will support this as a single if it is chosen to be one.    Average Album Rating (3.4 stars)  This is a close call. If you are a die hard Miley fan, buy the album. For everyone else, ITunes or Limewire will be sufficient.
0441013597|2.0|I guess it's just personal taste, but I'm sorry to say that I did not really like Dune that much.  I really wanted to; I know it has a great reputation, and legions of fans who have read it multiple times. I just finished reading it last night.  The overall setting and the complex story were fine. The opening scene, the visit from the Reverend Mother, was intriguing. But, somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just didn't click with me. You know how some books have wonderfully-crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you? Well, this book was not like that. Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded. As well, while there was a great assortment of characters, I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.     I had previously read a couple of Herbert's sci-fi novels, and liked them, but this one, well, doesn't get 5 stars from me. Your mileage may vary...    I won't be reading any of the remaining books.
9889979942|5.0|There are more than 1.3 billion people in China. Besides the majority Han Chinese, the population includes 56 ethnic groups numbering over one hundred million. Over the course of 2 years and 35,000 miles, photojournalist Tom Carter captured it ALL on film.<br /><br />For their historical value alone, the 800+ photos in Portrait are priceless. I highly doubt if there will ever be another book about China like this one. Carter's anthropological-like study of China stands apart in its genre, as it focuses expressly on the PEOPLE of China. In addition to documenting the everyday life of \\"ordinary\\" people, Carter also backpacked to the most remote areas of China to observe reclusive ethnic minorities such as the red-turbaned Pai Yao minority of northern Guangdong and the resplendent Dong and Miao tribes of eastern Guizhou.<br /><br />From Inner Mongolian nomads to newlyweds in Hong Kong, from the teenage girl living in Chengdu dressed like an American punk rocker to the soot covered coal miner in Southern Shanxi, Carter's camera documented the complexity and diversity of China like no other book ever has (or likely ever will). There is an old saying that a picture is equal to a thousand words. In CHINA: Portrait of a People, each picture is worth TEN thousand words, maybe more.<br /><br />The consensus amongst backpackers is that China is probably the single most challenging country in the world to visit. As such, in order to reach certain locations, Carter had to travel on foot into some seriously rugged terrain. To get an idea what I'm talking about, consider that China, almost the size of the United States, uses only sixteen percent of its land for growing crops. The rest is either mountains or desert.<br /><br />To take the up-close and personal pictures in CHINA: Portrait of a People, Carter also risked jail multiple times; was stranded in Tibet; faced exhaustion and hunger; was beaten by drunks; plagued by a nearly-fatal viral infection, and risked being shot by North Korean border guards. And that was only the first year!<br /><br />If you plan to visit China, buy this book before you go. On the other hand, if you are an armchair tourist who never strays far from home, Carter's Portrait will not disappoint. The warmth of the Chinese comes cross in every image from cover to cover. You will laugh along with the Tibetan nomads seeing their photo for the very first time, and scratch your head at the eight-year-old acrobat student at Wuqiao bending herself like a folded sheet of paper.<br /><br />Between the covers of Portrait, you will start a vicarious journey visiting China like few photographers have ever accomplished. With this thick, 600-page book, you too can travel on this 35,000 mile journey without ever leaving your home. Or better, it will inspire you to make a similar journey.<br /><br />There is no way that this review can do justice for the monumental accomplishment that is CHINA: Portrait of a People. Seeing is believing.<br /><br />Lloyd Lofthouse, author of \\"My Splendid Concubine\\"that was only the first year!    If you plan to visit China, buy this book before you go.

030726999X|5.0|I read both of the previous books in the series, and think this one is his best! There was a bit less graphic violence, and he does a great job of wrapping up all of the mysteries and loose ends. This book spends more time developing the character of Lisbeth, which I loved. I did find that I had to keep going back to re-read some parts, because it's a very convoluted story, but I couldn't put the book down!
B002VPE1B6|3.0|The Blue Ray DVD was slightly defective as the last 3 mins of the movie was missing..during the final 10 mins the Blue Ray DVD screen \\"skipped\\" and lost the ending at the end completely...Had to watch the movie  on the DVD disc to learn the ending..decided against returning both since the DVD Disc wasnt damaged and thus 50% satisfied..next time will purchase at local store where it's more convenient when problems come up.
B0034JKZ86|3.0|I am probably going to piss quite a few Disney fans off by not giving this movie a glowing review. Just remember before you see red that I am not saying The Princess and the Frog is a bad movie, on the contrary it is quite good. What I am saying is that it lacks something compared to other Disney films.<br /><br />The Princess and the Frog is about a young woman named Tiana who struggle to earn a living as a waitress in 1920's New Orleans. Her dream is to open up her own restaurant. At the same time a prince from a non existent Slavic sounding country arrives in town. (Ever notice that whenever American movie makers need a royal person they invent some nation with a name that ends with via, like Moldavia, Moldevia and so on.) The prince have been disowned by his parents for his outgoing lifestyle and he is looking for a wealthy woman to marry so he can continue his jet set lifestyle. Unfortunately this Prince end up in the claws of an evil Hoodoo sorcerer called the Shadow Man which turn him into a frog. Later he meets Tiana who have borrowed a dress from her rich friend Charlotte. The Prince talks Tiana into kissing him believing her to be a princess, however as she is not she is instead turned into a frog to and the movie is mostly about them trying to find a way to become human again. Along the way they pick up a half mad Cajun firefly and a music loving alligator.<br /><br />Now all in all this movie is fun. The story is interesting and the animation as always with Disney is perfect. The characters springs to life on the screen and it has obviously taken allot of pepole enormous amounts of time and effort to animate them. However the movie do have some problems. Let me list them.<br /><br />Problem 1: Who was the target audience for this film? It seams far more directed towards adults than children. First off all the movie's princess is as boring as boring can be. Let us have a look at other Disney princesses and other female leads, they all had something special about them, something which made them interesting. Tiana is an everyday girl, she is poor, but she is not so poor as to create the fighting against injustice type character like with Cinderella. She is an average, lower class girl who works to jobs trying to realize her dream to start an restaurant. Had this movie been set in modern times she could have been your next door neighbor. Realism is well and good but not in a Disney animated movie, they are supposed to be about magic and wonder. Let us see, Esmeralda is a fiery Gypsy dancer who fight for the freedom of her downtrodden pepole, Ariel is a mermaid and the daughter of the King of the sea himself who sacrifice it all for love, Aurora is a princess raised by three fairies, and the list go on and on. Tiana is a waitress.<br /><br />This movie did not do that well in the cinema and I can definitely see where the problem lies. Adults might like the realism of this movie, however the biggest target audience for a Disney cartoon is children, and for a princess movie, little girls in particular. Well the princess in this movie spend most of it as a frog, and most of the time when she is human she is not wearing pretty dresses and doing things that are attractive for little girls, she is just a waitress.<br /><br />Now there are Disney films more directed at boys, usually with a male lead. But in those there are at least some fights and action, though off course not worse fights than to be acceptable for children. In this movie there is hardly any of that, even defeating the main villain is not done with any kind of action so the movie is clearly more geared towards girls, but there is really nothing for little girls to enjoy in it.<br /><br />The Princess and the Frog do have some interesting and funny side characters. Including the Shadow Man the main villain, but these characters are given so very little screen time as the movie focuses so much on Tiana. For adults the story of a poor girl who works hard to get what she want in life an finally succeeds is interesting. However I do not see that this movie will really be that attractive to children.<br /><br />Problem 2: In most Disney movies the music is wonderful and memorable. I mean how many pepole do not know the music of the Lion King by heart, and after watching a Disney cartoon I always find myself humming the tunes for weeks afterwards. When I had finished watching the Princess and the Frog I found that I remembered none of the songs, not as in the text had not stuck but as in I remembered nothing about them. The music in this movie is not bad, it is just that it extremely generic, which is strange for a movie which has music as a central theme.<br /><br />Problem 3: Where the hell is that Disney magic? I am not here talking about magic power in the film as it are plenty of that with two sorcerers and some evil Spirits thrown in the mix. I am talking about that special touch which make Disney cartoon movies special. For example in one of the scenes in the film there is a Mardi Gras parade. It would have been a perfect opportunity to show some of the details and dazzling animation skill that Disney is so famous for, however instead they show one or two attractions in the distance with no details and then straight to the character's doing stuff. Most Disney cartoons is a feat for the eyes, there is so much detail that you can see the film 100 times and still not catch it all, not so with this film, it plain and simple skimps on the details at times.<br /><br />Problem 4: This movie should have been longer, it uses so much time setting up Tiana's background story that there is no time for the secondary characters to shine or for about anything else. The movie feels rushed. And extra 20 minutes would have made this movie oh so much better.<br /><br />Problem 5: The plot off this movie is so extremely contrived that even a child of five would loose suspicion of disbelief. Ok situation: The prince have been turned into a frog, and knowing the story of the frog price he decides he have to kiss a princess. He sees a girl in a pretty dress and a tiara at a masquerade party and then just assumes she is royalty. Yes for there are so many princesses in USA and every girl in a evening gown in royalty right? I mean seriously they could not find some other way for the misconception to happen something a bit more believable?<br /><br />In conclusion. I am not writing this to bash the Princess and the Frog, as in all honesty it is a good movie. It is colorful, and at times it shines, as with for example the fireflies or the Shadow Man. However it is just that this movie is far under the standard for Disney it is probably the worst of their animated movies, that still makes the Princess and the Frog a pretty good movie, but it is not what I would expect from Disney.resting.

0375413405|5.0|This book is excellent. It really breaks down everything into extremely easy to follow steps while still producing amazing dishes. I love the sections dedicated only to sauces, eggs, vegetables etc that show someone not very experienced exactly how it should be done. If you love cooking this book is a must have!
B000BTC5LW|2.0|Good music, but In the Flesh has a better selection of the real Pink Floyd music including Animals, The Wall (including mother)and many others (Includes almost all the songs of Dark Side of the Moon).  Also better quality and better sound.  You need to have this one if you are a Pink Floyd fan, but I enjoy 300 times more, In the Flesh.
0446691437|3.0|I picked up this book because I heard a quote from it that I found highly inspirational.  Unfortunately, it lacked the power throughout the book that one quote contained.  I feel like I already had the best the book had to offer.  That's not to say it's a terrible book.  Pressfield is just a bit too metaphysical about his advice for overcoming resistance.  The advice boils down to \\"Put on your boots and go to work.\\"  That's good advice, but it seemed like an awful lot of well-written fluff to say that.  Maybe I just prefer my self-help books a little less flowery.  In a way, I began to see reading the book as a form of resistance, so I just skimmed through the last section of it.  That's where I ended up finding the gem that I had heard previously.  On the last page of the book, no less!  Oh well.  At least I can say I read it.

0321334876|5.0|Along with classics such as Kernighan & Ritchie's \\"The C programming language\\" and Steve McConnell's \\"Code Complete\\", \\"Effective C++\\" by Scott Meyers belongs to a very small list of indispensable books on programming. Its main difference from K&R and Code Complete is that \\"Effective C++\\" assumes you have already read another book on the topic, and you are now trying to make effective use of the powerful beast that is C++.    The Good: Meyers has divided his material into 55 Items, which he then grouped into 9 Chapters focusing on broad topics such as resource management, object-oriented design, and generic programming. Each Item is easy to read, to the point, and immensely valuable to every C++ programmer. Some of the issues discussed are quite counterintuitive; here are three of my favorite examples: a) it is possible to have a pure virtual function for which a definition must be provided (Item 7), b) a single object might have more than one address (Item 27), and c) a freestanding empty object is usually as big as a char and if contained within another object might cause the latter to gain the size of an int (Item 39). In such cases, as well as when covering less obscure topics (e.g. C++ generally doesn't look in templatized base classes for inherited names, Item 43), Meyers offers solid and carefully reasoned advice. Each item is aptly titled and ends with a brief list of \\"Things to remember\\"; these lists are very useful when re-reading this volume. The third edition of \\"Effective C++\\" was published in 2005, so it is not only compliant with standard (1998/2003) C++, but it has also incorporated current best practices that have emerged since the standard was established. Finally, the book also includes discussions of concepts relevant to the soon-to-be-published new standard (still known as C++0x), through Technical Report 1 (especially on tr1::shared_ptr).    The Bad: since this book was not written in the future [sic], it does not contain material on aspects ofC++0x that had not been finalized in 2005. It will probably take Meyers a few more years to determine which aspects of the new standard are sufficiently tricky as to be included in the fourth edition of his book. Thus, even though this is among the most up-to-date C++ books on the market, it does not (since it could not) contain too much on C++0x. Apart from this, the main (to be honest, the only) complaint I have is that this book uses different conventions for pointers when they are in a function's return type (T* func()) and in a variable definition (T *var) -- unless we're dealing with pointer-to-char in which case all bets are off. Following from this is another difference, that between pointer parameters (func(T *param)) and reference parameters (func(T& param)). The fact that I'm reduced to mentioning these conventions in a paragraph allegedly dealing with \\"The Bad\\" aspects of the book shows how impressive and essentially flawless this volume is.    There are those (few, unhappy few) who say that a good reference like Stroustrup's \\"The C++ Programming Language\\" or Lippman/Lajoie/Moo's \\"C++ Primer\\" obviates the need for books like those in the \\"Effective C++\\" series. Such criticisms miss the point: 1,000-page volumes are necessary, but Meyers's format is considerably more pedagogical and therefore more... effective.    In some ways this book is well complemented by Stephen Dewhurst's \\"C++ Common Knowledge\\" (especially when it comes to template programming) and by Meyers's other works (\\"More Effective C++\\" and \\"Effective STL\\"), but if you can afford to buy only one of these volumes you should get \\"Effective C++\\". I look forward to reading the fourth edition.    Alexandros Gezerlis
B0030EWB96|5.0|I first heard Hiromi on Stanley Clarke's Jazz in the Garden and was captivated by the clarity and beauty of her playing. I was then fortunate enough to see her live (with SC) at Blues Alley in Washington. That took my respect for her ability to a whole new level. She is simply phenomenal to listen to and watch live, as, I must say, were all the ensemble that night.    The first thing I did on returning home to New Zealand (where unfortunately Hiromi is not well known) was to purchase this album (thanks Amazon for the awesome delivery time). I'm not disappointed!    This album positively overflows with both Hiromi's technical genius and the sheer joy she brings to the piano. I will listen to this many many times, it is beautiful, uplifting music.    Don't hesitate. Buy this album. You won't be disappointed.    Thanks Hiromi. Hope to see you down under some time real soon.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|This review is more about the packaging than the actual movie. The movie is awesome---a must see. Not much plot but visually stunning. Now about the 2 disc combo---why would anyone want a regular DVD with a blu-ray DVD. A better \\"combo\\" for blu-ray fans would have been a movie disc and a special features disc. But noooooo-Cameron is milking this for all it's worth as there is talk of something like that coming out later this year. It should have come out like that to begin with.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|This will be the best rock album to come out this year. If you like DEVO then you like DEVO. This album sounds a lot like the music they were putting out in the mid 80s with just a hint of better synths. It sounds more Honda commercial than it does Mr DNA, but all and all it still rocks. Thank you DEVO for staying true to the game.

Rick Riordan is the only author who can role fantasy in with history and not make it boring. you have to read it. every other chapter ends with a cliff hanger. the way the book is written you will see this story come to life before your eyes and you will know the characters quite well by the mid point of the book. you have to read this book. all in all this is one of my favorite books and it will be one of yours. you don't have to be a fantasy lover to love this book. so read this book.

B001HN694K|3.0|Perhaps an alternate title for Tim Burton's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" should have been \\"Green Screen Theatre,\\" because that's all I see when I look at this film - people standing around pretending to talk to and interact with invisible objects. As a viewer it was not engaging at all. The CG was very cartoonish and distracting, and really made me miss the days when movies used actual sets and props to tell their stories. Now, I know  these kinds of movies are meant as a kind of mental escape, a fantasy, and I'm sure they are still fully capable of sparking the imaginations of young children, which is good, but on the other hand I feel sort of bad for the kids today growing up on this stuff because they'll never appreciate the TRULY innovative movies like Wizard of Oz or Willy Wonka, or god forbid anything animated in 2-D. Not that \\"Alice\\" was all around a bad movie, because at face value it's actually very entertaining and the costumes are terrific. But for me personally, the magic is lost when you know the whole thing was made over the course of a month on someone's laptop computer. Plus these Johnny Depp/Tim Burton collaborations are getting old. They had one good movie like 20 years ago and have recycled the same old shtick six or seven times since then in some form or another, and quite frankly I'm bored with both of them. Both are extremely talented, creative men in their own right, but have fallen into a rut these past few years and really need to branch out.

Superman Returns is like Superman: The Movie and Superman III of course without any super villain(s) like you see in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Superman Returns is a buy or at least a rent.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|This is a terrific album.  We have played it many times, both in the house<br />and in the car.  The harmony is perfect.  It's one of the very best albums<br />I have bought in a long time.  They sound as good as they ever did, and that's<br />very good indeed.<br /><br />The song about Machine Kelly was  a disappointment.  I wish they had left<br />that off.  That's the only thing I didn't like.
B000VI70WM|3.0|I hear a lot of comparisons to Big Thing with Red Carpet Massacre and let me try and set the record straight, I would rather listen to Big Thing for the rest of my life than listen to RCM one more time. Duran Duran seems to have a pattern of returning to a techno-beat driven album after every classic sounding album they have made starting with Notorious: Big Thing, Mezzadaland, and now RCM. Big Thing and Mezzadaland at least still retain the unique sound Duran Duran has worked hard in creating, but now thanks to Justin Timberlake and his ability to brainwash the masters, RCM veers off in a direction that could only be described as Duran Duran Massacred. From the first track with The Valley you are introduced to pretty much the whole album, a beat-driven mish mosh of synthetic sounds completely eliminating anything \\"real\\". Roger Taylor's eclectic drumming style is dumbed down to just simplicity to which this could be anyone on the drums. John Taylor is pretty much non-existant and Nike Rhodes sounds as if he was replaced with a computer. There are a few nice things about RCM. For one, Simon's voice is raw, clear and excellent sounding. It's about the only thing in each song that reminds you that it's Duran Duran. 2nd, the song Falling Down is VERY reminiscent of Mezzadaland and Astronaut but almost ruined by the underproduction. If you were to play Falling Down off this album then load up Astronaut and play What Happens Tomorrow you will notice a complete 180 degree turn for the worse here with Falling Down but at least it makes an effort to come back to the sound we love to hear from Duran Duran.     After the perfect outing with Astronaut to the now abysmal outing with RCM one can only hope the pattern continues and in two albums we have another classic. But as for RCM, skip it. You are missing nothing. Even for hard core fans I would say skip it and that's a big thing to be saying.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|It's been almost a year since I finished this book, and the characters and haunting story line are still playing in my imagination as if I finished reading yesterday.  Original and exciting, I have recommended it to all of my reading friends.  Well worth every cent, and minute spent.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|A fun little watch, but with the heart monitor I can no longer dog it on my runs.  I also found out that my distance was a bit short.  It takes a little getting used to the bezel-touch interface, but once you figure it out it works pretty well.     The lap feature (I set mine to every 1/2 mile) allows you to see your current pace rather than the average pace since the start.  The Virtual Partner feature provides an electronic rabbit with a predefined pace; that display shows you the time and distance you are ahead or behind your rabbit.  You can activate three customizable displays, each of which can show 1, 2 or 3 data items.  In addition the heart rate display is customizable.  You can have the watch automatically switch between the active displays or only switch manually on a bezel-tap.    The Garmin \\"Sports Center\\" software is adequate but not as full featured as might be desired.  The wireless transfer works well on my XP laptop but I am unable to install it on my XP desktop (locks up the entire computer during install).      The altitude feature is a bit twitchy but that's the nature of GPS which isn't normally very accurate in the altitude direction.  Probably a better smoothing algorithm could take some of that noise out of the altitude; my course is flat as a board yet the watch records lots of ups and downs.  I'll have to take it on a hike to see how it does in the z axis.    I don't really have any complaints.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|The AmazonBasics Quilted Case is great for holding media players such as iPods, BlueTooth devices, pocket digital cameras and even reading glasses. The drawstring opening secures your device inside and the neat belt clip can clip is convenient to clip it onto a backpack, purse, even your belt loops.  The price is comparable to other cases on the market and the extra padding from the waterproof quilted material affords extra protection for your valuable small electronics. I loved the fact that it was large enough to fit a Smartphone and all those other must haves that you just can't seem to find a case for!
B000G04UW8|5.0|Hat tip to \\"Mark C.\\" of Seattle, who mentioned a 2006 remastered version (REP 5080) in another version's review (ASIN: B0000073BG). Here we have it, remastered version REP 5080!<br /><br />The timbre and soundstage of this recording conveys concert hall realism with 21st century brilliance of clarity, surprising when one considers it was first cut in the 70s.  Every nuanced overlay is audible in breathtaking detail on this CD. The sound quality is crystal clear and luscious.<br /><br />I don't need to point out the haunting beauty of its content which has been reviewed dozens of times already. What I want to emphasize is the high caliber of fidelity so abundantly clear in this particular release. If you ever sought to possess a copy of Scheherazade & Other Stories and want the best - you have arrived.<br /><br />Repertoire presents it like a miniature LP, with the disc inside a sleeve which is inside an originally-illustrated shrink wrapped cardboard jacket instead of a jewel case. Tucked inside with the sleeve there is a folded 8x8\\" glossy print with album and artists details on side 1. On side 2 is a write up about Renaissance along with a bit of what went into creation of the Scheherazade album and other albums the group produced later.
B002VPE1YS|4.0|This is a well-made little slipcase. For the price you really can't beat it.     The fabric is a smooth quilted nylon, inside and out.   I find that my camera slides in and out of the pouch easier than my similar neoprene case, because the fabric is so smooth.  The quilting is more substantial than I'd expected, so it seems like it should provide a nice bit of cushioning against minor drops or banging around in a bag.   The stitches are nice and tight, with no hanging threads.  Just seems like nice, quality workmanship.   My only quibble with quality would be the carabiner on the back -- it is very thin and light, and does not inspire confidence.    The dimensions stated in the description are accurate.   It is sized generously enough to hold most subcompact cameras easily.  My Canon SD100, Panasonic DMC-FP1, and Flip Mino all fit with some room left over (mostly in length).
B002VPE1B6|5.0|If you liked the movie and are considering getting it, you can't go wrong with the Blu-ray and DVD combo for $19.99 on Amazon.<br /><br />I do however recommend an HDTV and a blu-ray player for this movie to get the full experience.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed 'A Beautiful Mind.' It's one of those very rare movies made for an audience of reasonably mature and intelligent adults as opposed to low IQ inner-city gangbangers with a mental age of around 14 who seem to be the target audience of most Hollywood fare today.     The plot is different and holds our interest to the end; the camera work is technical perfection with none of that faddish hand-held camera nonsense; the Princeton settings are gorgeous; and the actors are without exception excellent, with Russell Crowe giving a sensitive and totally convincing performance as the brilliant and afflicted mathematician, John Nash, a man suffering from schizophrenia.    But what exactly is schizophrenia? According to Wikipedia, it is \\"a mental disorder characterized by abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking with significant social or occupational dysfunction\\" ([...]    This seems clear enough, since we have all been convinced of the reality of \\"mental\\" illness. But if we turn to Thomas Szasz [[ASIN:0815602243 Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry]] we find a highly intelligent professional psychiatrist informing us that, not only is schizophrenia a myth, but that there is no such thing as \\"mental illness\\", the term \\"illness\\" being something that can legitimately be applied only to physical bodies and not to minds, mind being something of an entirely different order.    So what's going on here? In the movie, Nash is eventually able to come to terms with his schizophrenia by realizing that the figures he continues to hallucinate, and who seem to him to be flesh-and-blood realities every bit as real as the people around him, are wholly illusory and simply projections of his own mind.    If he had been born in Asia and had come in contact with the non-dual perspective he might have learned that the whole of reality is similarly a projection of mind and entirely illusory; that his mind is only doing what is natural to it in projecting a world made entirely of Consciousness; and that the only difference between him and others is that, by some quirk, his mind has added a few extra events (which only he is able to perceive) to the world he shares with all of us. He might then have gone on to realize that, by leading him to a truer understanding of mind, what seemed to him at first to be a curse was in fact a Grace.     These notions lead us into the field of Nonduality and anyone interested in pursuing them further could do no better than to read a book such as Leo Hartong's [[ASIN:0954779215 Awakening to the Dream]]. Of the vast literature on Nonduality, this is the simplest and clearest account I've ever found.     But to return to the movie, please don't miss it. At its best, the modern movie can and should be a work of art, and the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' certainly qualifies as that.
B000000SDN|5.0|Recently, I've had the pleasure of listening to three very fine recordings of Cosi fan tutte, each of them beautiful and each of them very different.<br /><br />Capsule comments below:<br /><br />Harnoncourt:  I am not normally a fan of Harnoncourt but this is a wonderful set, with excellent singing and orchestra playing and luscious state-of-the-art recorded sound.  Harnoncourt takes a slow and sensuous approach to Cosi with a lot of attention to the polyphonic layers in the music.  This results in certain numbers that any Mozart fan needs to hear, including the whisper-soft quintet \\"Di scrivermi\\" (Act 1) and the complex aria \\"Donne Mie\\" (Act 2), played at maybe 2/3 the speed of normal renditions, which unpacks its intricate orchestral writing.  All three of these recordings feature excellent Fiordiligis - here it is Charlotte Margiono, who has a more full-bodied voice than Schwarzkopf or Isokoski, but is completely up-to-the-task and matches the better-known sopranos.  The orchestra plays in what I would described as \\"historically-influenced\\" style, with little strong vibrato and a very small lower strings section.  Harnoncourt's approach has some weaknesses - the two finale sequences don't have the grace and flow you hear in the other CDs, for example - but this a strongly-recommended set.  (I am baffled by the pans below.)<br /><br />Karajan:  This 1954 recording is one of the most famous made, justifiably so.  Much faster than the Harnoncourt, it presents Cosi as a witty, fleet comic opera.  The cast is great, led by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (Fiordiligi), who ranges from the very good to the electrifying (check out the duet Fra gliu amplessi, in the 2nd act, where Fiordiligi relents and capitulates) and a Don Alfonso, Sesta Bruscantini, who sings with flexibility and expression.  The finales are often amazing, performed with spirit and accurate ensemble.  Let's get to the weeknesses:  1) the sound - the recording is from 1954, so it doesn't have the detail or the refinement of modern recordings; 2) I found Nan Merriman (Dorabella) to be the least impressive singer in any of these three sets, with rhythmic and pitch issues as well as IMO an unattractive, rounded voice.  But the strengths here overwhelm any flaws.  I'll highlight the incredible Act 1 ensemble about the wind (\\"Soave sia il vente\\"), luscious and graceful.  You'll want to play that track again and again.<br /><br />Kuijken: This is a historically-informed recording (tries to adhere to performance practice from 1790) from a live 1992 concert performance in Hungary.  I think of Sigismund Kuijken as a conductor who generally has a sensuous take, but this is not the case here in a very active rendition with the quickest tempi of the three, even faster than the Karajan.  The singing is excellent, with the star Finnish soprano Soile Isokoski sparkling as Fiordiligi.  Highlights include her military-style aria \\"Come scoglio\\" (Act 1), which is famous and I think was notably better than the versions in the other sets discussed here, and the finales, which are sparkling and expertly paced and sung.  (They brought a smile to my face each time I listened to them.)  The other cast members are strong.  Good performance.  The problem here is the audio, which I actually found more grating than the 1954 Karajan set - it is \\"early digital\\" so has some harsh treble.  The miking is also strange - the singers are very much highlighted, with the strings in the middle ground and the winds very much in the background.  Still, a very nice performance with a lot to recommend it.<br /><br />All in all, three wonderful sets of a beautiful, major opera, with a silly plot (but not a silly theme) and a very complex musical score which shows Wolfgang at the peak of his ability.  I didn't listen to the famous later Schwarzkopf recording with Karl Bohm, a conductor in whom I have no interest, so  the survey is incomplete.recordings; 2) I found Nan Merriman (Dorabella) to be the least impressive singer in any of these three sets, with rhythmic and pitch issues as well as IMO an unattractive, rounded voice.

B0000AYJXR|5.0|I bought this DVD as a used item. I was very pleased with its condition, and it plays perfectly.
B001CO42MU|3.0|There are plenty of comments re: the merits of the movie itself, so this review is just about the sound on the blu-ray edition.  It is at least a full second out of sync with the video, making it seem almost like a cheap kung fu movie that has been dubbed in English.   And no, this isnt a problem with my equipment (PS3), which has successfully played over 100 other blu-rays without audio sync problems.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|This is not just a movie; it is an absolutely phenomenal movie, definitely a collectable item for you, your children and your children's children. I recently completed reading the novel \\"Gandhi\\" and this movie unquestionably brought it to life. The lessons of this \\"GREAT MAN,\\" certainly etched in my mind, heart and soul the values of humility in this modern day world. EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY OF A MOVIE, IN ALL RESPECT!

0143038419|1.0|Honestly, I don't think this women learned anything on her trip. But quite frankly, I'm not sure I believe three quarters of the the things in this book actually happened. All these people with so much wisdom to offer just fall into her lap? Give me a break, lady! How dumb do you think we are?  I didn't appreciate her assumptions about religion either. At one point, she talks about how she over works herself (ha!), which she attributes to the lingering Protestant in her. What the? I'm not even Protestant and I thought that was offensive. As if being Protestant some how makes her treat herself badly.   And I was extremely disappointed in her trip to India. She learned squat about spirituality. All she learned about was a blue light. And she never really explained what merit this experience with the blue light had.   And then she hooks up with another guy. This poor woman is clingy as can be. She needs to learn to stand on her own two feet.   I think a more appropriate title would be \\"Pig out, Meditate, and have Great Sex\\".

0439023483|4.0|Ages 12 and up.    Katniss, a young girl in a dystopian future has taken her sister's place in the Hunger Games, sort of a mix of Shirley Jackson's Lottery and King's the Running Man.  In the Hunger Games, she is placed in an arena and must be the last survivor of similarly aged kids.  If she wins, a life of leisure awaits her and her family back in her home.  If she loses, death.    Katniss is a complex but likable character that faces the challenges ahead of here with a great deal of bravery but at no point does she feel single-dimensional or contrived.      The first in a trilogy, the Hunger Games paints a world filled with great separations between the haves (in the Capitol) and the have-nots (pretty much everyone else) and a complicated and tenuous political/social structure.    While targeted to the Grade 7 level, it is still a compelling and satisfying read for adults.
0316779237|1.0|His previous books were laugh-out-loud funny; I once had to stop my car because I was laughing too hard when listening to one of his books on tape. But this one was sad and disturbing. I struggled to keep reading after the woman killed her grandbaby in a clothes dryer, in an attempt to frame her husband's newly discovered adult illegitimate Vietnamese daughter (yes, that classic Xmas story). There were funny moments in the department store elf piece, although even that just sounded angry by the end.     Gifted humorists make us laugh at our own shortcomings, but they do this from our side of the line. It feels like Sedaris has crossed the line, really rather hates most people, and believes he can only top previous writing by developing more outrageous and darker plots -- ones that I can't relate to at all. It's a shame because there's a wealth of information to be mined from day to day 'normal' human interactions around the holiday season.

B001BPJJ82|4.0|The tragedy here is that one really needs to see \\"The Fall\\" in a good-quality theater.  Even on a 53\\" HDTV, it just doesn't measure up to its potential.  Some movies are simply meant to be projected on a wide screen.    But it's still very worthwhile to see this, even if you have a medium-sized HDTV.  (Don't even bother with the standard DVD version.  Save your milk and egg money and get the BD.)    Other reviewers have gone on at length about the film, so I won't belabor the points they have made so well.  Let it suffice to say that \\"The Fall\\" approaches some of the most beautiful films ever made (e.g., \\"Barry Lyndon\\") and surpasses most others.  As Roger Ebert observed, it deserves to be seen simply because it exists, and there won't ever be another film like it.
0891419195|4.0|A terrific read,very descriptive in it's content.<br />If your into the battles for the Pacific Islands then this is the book for you.
0195067142|5.0|I read this book as one of three. I enjoyed watching the HBO/Playtone series \\"The Pacific\\" this spring. So, I read this book, plus two others to get more of the story. It is always difficult to get a feel when we only get one episode a week for 10 weeks. The books help. The other two are, \\"I'll Stay With My Boys\\" (about Medal of Honor winner Sgt. John Basilone) and \\"My Helmet for My Pillow.\\" All three were used as a basis for the series and all three are excellent. After reading all three I will never ever complain about hardship again. These men that fought for our freedom and to defend our country were more than men. They were heros that endured hardships that we will never know about.

PROBABLY THAT IS DUE TO MY NOT BEING FAMILIAR WITH SWEDISH NAMES BUT NONETHELESS IT WAS A FACTOR IN MY ENJOYMENT OF THE STORY ITSELF....ONCE I WAS HALF-WAY THROUGH IT BECAME MORE INTERESTING AND READABLE.

Since I was reading this book, it gives me a guidance in my daily decisions and it really works.

B002CM03PQ|4.0|At first sight and after reading the press release I was disappointed with this commemorative box set.  On a second thought when I bought the DVD I changed my mind but I still think that the ultimate release of the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair is yet to be done, period.    Woodstock Music and Arts Fair (1969) along with Monterey Pop Festival (1967), Atlanta Pop Festival (1970), and Isle of Wight (1970) are the only festivals of the sixties and early seventies that were properly recorded both on audio and video formats.  Nevertheless it has been more recently that parts of the recorded material has been released after being stored for almost 40 years, while another bunch still remains unreleased.     Woodstock is not only one of the best known festivals of all the times, but it is also the most complete testify of the summer of 1969 festivals in USA:  Newport 69 (June 20 - 22), Newport Jazz Festival (July 3 - 6), Newport Folk Festival (July 16 - 20,), Atlanta International Pop Festival (August 1 - 3), and Texas International Pop Festival (August 30 - September 1).  Almost all the music performed at Woodstock was carefully recorded (hello Eddie Kramer) and filmed (when rain and humidity allowed to), something that didn't happen with the other 1969 festivals (maybe \\"Got no Shoes Got no Blues\\" film for the Texas Festival but this one is of an inferior quality).     I have reviewed previous re-releases of this film and its soundtrack and most of my comments refers to the music, the missing artists, the wrong order of featuring (with no indication of which day actually is) and cut short performances.  I do understand the amazing work done over the film and it really deserves the prizes and recognitions won over the past, but I think it's time to go a step ahead and dust off the unique material stored for 40 years (D. A. Pennebaker did something about it with the Woodstock Diary DVD set).    I think it's really a shame that Warner Home Video had lost the chance to do a DEFINITIVE edition of the festival.  It should have been a fantastic opportunity to have included long forgotten artists and to expand even more those already known performances, even though there is a large quantity of officially filmed material that still remains unreleased and it has only been partially available as bootleg videos. By the way you need more than a source to get all the video music available (Woodstock Film in all its incarnations including this box set, Woodstock Diary, Woodstock Lost Performances).    There are artists not included in any of the releases of the festival: Sweetwater, Quill (just seconds of film on Woodstock Diary), Incredible String Band (same quote as for Quill), Ravi Shankar (same quote as for Quill) and Keef Hartley Band.    Also there are artists with very well known extra material officially filmed not included in this box set: Richie Havens (3 extra songs, 2 of which are in Lost Performances), Country Joe (complete performance), John Sebastian (1 song), Swami Satchidananda speech, Arlo Guthrie (2 songs), Blood Sweat and Tears (4 songs one of which is available on Lost Performances), Janis Joplin, Credence Clearwater Revival (2 extra songs), Grateful Dead, The Who (the band has included various portions of their performance on The Kids are Alright DVD), Paul Butterfield Blues Band (1 song), Crosby Stills Nash & Young (at least 1 song with Young actually performing).  These performances are one of a kind and the best recorded examples of the 1969 summer festivals in USA    The Box Set:     - Bonus Disc:  Some of these performances are already released items.    Jimi's Spanish Castle Magic is on the complete set of his performance. Canned Heat performing Woodstock Boogie is available on others DVD of Woodstock, but the main thing is that is totally abridge to less than a third from the the total time.  The Who's Sparks is available on the Kids are Alright DVD.    The Who's full performance MUST be fully recorded and filmed but Ithink Mr. Townshend has not approved the release (see next comment).  The Ox and Keith have passed away so what a great tribute should be an official release of their performance.  I have asked The Who official site about it but no news about it.   The featurettes are really interest but too brief in my opinion since they are from the people that actually made the festival.    -Woodstock: Untold Stories: All performances are amazing and worth to be seen, most of them are unreleased (40 years on the shelves!!) and a \\"must-have\\" to anyone interested in rock / blues music.   Joan Baez is great but I missed the songs available on Woodstock Diary. Country Joe is fully filmed and same quality (I got the video!). Santana looks great and sounds incredible (I can't believe that only two numbers were filmed, I think the whole set is filmed as it is the soundtrack). Canned Heat is pretty well covered since Going Up the Country is included on Lost Performances (a terrible quality image indeed) and Woodstock Boogie is the only number still unreleased in its full length. Mountain's \\"Southbound Train\\" is finally complete (edited version on Woodstock Diary).  The Deads number is really an invaluable example of a 60's live performance of the band (All the boys are here, Pigpen, Jerry, Bobby, Billy, TC, Phil and Micky).  Creedence is fine and resurfaces in all its form.      The Who performance is a different matter since their portion shown on film has been always too abridged (on Woodstock Diary was added \\"My Generation\\"). They performed TOMMY!! and also Heaven or Hell.  At least \\"We are not gonna take it\\" is finally included as during a long time its name was used for \\"Summertime Blues\\".     J Airplane looks fantastic (Oh! that's Nicky Hopkins on Piano). J Cocker appears singing the same song performed the day before by Blood Sweat & Tears.  Johnny Winter number is edited as it is shown on Woodstock Diary (drum beat and guitar slide introduction are missing - the song lasts actually 8+ minutes), Paul Butterfield is excellent.    A special mention to The Who. They were one of the few British acts at Woodstock and Chip Monk introduction is very unusual and amazingly polite (Ladies and gentlemen please warmly show your appreciation for a band that came especially for this festival... a warmly welcome for The Who). Once again I think their whole performance is filmed and recorded (just take a look at \\"The Kids are alright DVD\\").  By the way there is a well known unreleased video (with time counter) of their set taken from the stage right camera that actually shows a handful of additional numbers, even Pete kicking the cameramen on stage and the seconds after the Abbie Hoffman incident (this same source was used for the additional Hendrix material included in the definitive edition of his performance).      About the interviews they are very interesting for those people that are really into the history of the festival and all the 60's events.  Great stories about filming, setting the Eclairs and getting the proper lights on the stage. I missed some people that must be in any Woodstock related project: John Roberts, Joel Rosenman (the pair that actually put the money), Arthur \\"Artie\\" Kornfeld, and John Morris.    In all I recommend this box mainly for the extra material included which is really fabulous.    Please note that Sony is currently releasing the complete sets on CD performed at Woodstock by J Winter, Santana, J Airplane, Sly and the Family Stone and Janis.  Rhino is about to release a mamooth like compilation of chronological assembled set of performances including more than 30 previously unreleased material.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|Since we did not have Showtime for much of the \\"L Word\\" run and since iTunes fails to offer Season 1 - it has been great fun to watch the series on DVD.  The show has great humor and always very entertaining ... the best part is it shows an overall positive view of the Gay Ladies.  Where is the \\"L Word\\" movie!?!
B002VPE1YS|5.0|I'm starting to love AmazonBasics products.  They're generally quality products in simple packaging at great prices, and this little case is no exception.<br /><br />The case is soft; quilted inside and outside.  The adjustable strap closes the top tightly.  The latch hook (not shown in the main photo at the time of this review) gives you the option of hooking the case to a belt loop, etc.<br /><br />Regarding the size: it fits my [[ASIN:B002UUTCKC Motorola Droid (first generation)]] with a Verizon snap-on protective casing installed on it snugly.  I can also use it with my [[ASIN:B002R5AM7C Flip MinoHD Camcorder]].  It would also be perfect for some of the flat-screen GPS units (although is a bit too small for my older, larger Garmin).<br /><br />This is a great little protective travel case for any small electronic device that would fit in it!
B001GCUO5M|1.0|Probably the worse movie Marty and the acting cast have had the misfortune of making ...     From the ineffective melodramatic incidental music as they drive from the ferry to the gates of Shutter Island the story, direction, and in some cases the acting, was like some egomaniacal pastiche created by an over-confident, and under talented art school undergraduate attempting to make his directorial debut by culling all the worse practices of previous B movie directors...    The storyline was predictable, and the only reason I hung on to the end was to:    a) see if it could get any worse ...    and    b) see if the obivous plot ending (I wont spoil it if you can call it that by mentioning it here) was in fact the ending ...    it was ...    either they were all \\"phoning this one in\\" ... or MS has totally lost the plot on this one ...    I'm glad I only paid $4.99 for this Video on Demand ...

B003KUSUG8|3.0|Eminem has come back from the dead and released a top notch album.  He shows that he is the most skilled rapper alive.  But the huge downfall of this album is the production.  It sounds good if your listening to it through a boombox or 1988 ford escort stereo system.  If you are a audiophile and have a decent 2ch setup the quality is painful to listen too.<br />Shame on Eminem for allowing this to happen.<br />What happened to quality music?????
0525423842|3.0|Grisham has been one of my favorite authors. I didn't realize it was a Youth novel when I picked it up in Bombay - it was in the regular section - perhaps the size or lack thereof should have warned me. A lot of the legal system is explained in a lucid manner, but the subject is rather dry. Given that Grisham intends to make this a series (another fact I was unaware of) - he takes pains to establish the characters in detail. Unfortunately, the young lawyer's family is a an American cliche.Loving, hard working parents who are lawyers and care for the needy. The proverbial good-hearted uncle with a grey past. Even a family dog. The book itself is a quick read and Grisham keeps things interesting rather than riveting. The main problem is the complete lack of a plot. It takes skills as an author to pen a novella without a plot and cliched character. And Grisham displays his skill through a bag of tricks with aplomb and dry humor. Is Theodore Boone an interesting character? Sure - if he actually had a case to solve the future books might hold potential. I would not recommend that you buy this book for your kid. It is no Harry Potter and whatever Grisham might think the American system comes nowhere close to Magic.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|Having recently gotten back from my first trip to Dallas, this movie brought back some deep emotions as to what actually happened.  First rate in my book.
0061537969|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read and I read A LOT! It really makes me wonder what my own dogs are thinking! Is the drama a bit over the top? Of course, but it's what makes it a good page turner.  Kudos to Garth Stein. I will be reading other works by him.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Devo has never sounded better and the album as a whole is incredible.  This is like a greatest hits package for the last 18 years or however long since their last new album...EXCEPT every song is brand spanking new. It just blows my mind that these guys, most if not all, in their mid to late 50s.  Inspires me that life doesn't end at 40 and can even be better musically and creatively!! This generation needs to get a clue and learn from these masters of ingenuity.  Skip rap altogether and read literature instead; hardly any rap song will be remembered 20 years from now.  Skip the whiny pop singers (Coldplay, etc.) and copy cat wannabes (the Strokes, etc.).  This is the real deal.  Get DEVO today!!

B0000B3B95|5.0|This movie is awesome i just wish the director and writer stuck with the original origins of the hulk. Thats one thying about the movie i don't like but the rest is awesome. Jennifer connley is a good Betty Ross and Eric Banna was awesome as Bruce Banner. to bad they did stay in the second one. well all in all this movie was good.<br />if you have not seen this movie then you should
B003JYOFIW|3.0|Great songs, but it's kind of annoying to hear such cliche sounds, like the 'robot voice' you've heard a million times on other projects for the last 30 years.  And vocoders on the vocals...stuff used for cheesy dance bands, not avant garde bands like Devo.  You'd think that they could drum up some really crazy, new stuff with all the technology out there now.  Too many sounds here sound like presets on a cheap Casio keyboard sold to kids in a toy store.  Dig deeper!  Rip the spleen from those synthesisera!    Yeah, yeah...I know...they invented a lot of what has become 'cliche' sounds by now...but what keep using them?  Do something new...just a bit.    Isn't Devo one of the bands that pushed the envelope, and made new sounds, not revisited old ones again?  Sure, I want it to sound like Devo, but the drum machine stuff, and the quacking keyboards sound so...well, cliche.  No better word for it.  Wish they pushed the envelope a little harder and came up with some more textured and experimental sounds.    And for God's sake, turn up the guitar in the mix!
0061122416|5.0|I purchased \\"The Alchemist\\" for use in a church book club.  We had a lively discussion about the book and all agreed it was a worthwhile read.  Questions came up at the wrap-up about describing who we each thought was The Alchemist and there were different opinions all around.  A thought provoking book which everyone should read and discuss as we did at our book club.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|First, its a stunning bluray quality picture!  This by far is the best live show picture quality I have ever seen.  Like someone said you can read the mouth piece from the Big Man's sax.<br /><br />Second, its a great show.  Full Springsteen ahead!  This by far in my opinion is the best live show Bruce and E street has released.  Yes, Bruce's voice has become even more rasp, but come on, he's 60.<br /><br />Third, this show captures the power as close as anything to being their in person.<br /><br />Forth, the only negative....  Its obvious Bruce didnt like being so far away from the crowd.  Thats not typical Bruce, he likes the crowd interaction and it was a long ways from the stage to the crowd at Hyde.<br /><br />Final, if you have never seen Bruce and E street in person, spend the money and go see him.  You see it in this DVD at 3 hours, and he plays that long at every show and puts forth all the effort you see in this DVD at every show.<br /><br />No I dont work for Landu.... That comment is too funny!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|No not Shady you fools Eminem is back... As a fan of Eminem I thought the last two albums had some ok songs but as an album it was horrible. You can tell something was wrong with eminem mentally he just wasn't their. Eminem has been in \\"Recovery\\" by his own admissions and he came out on this album fireing. Their is alot of good tracks and a few great tracks, Their is a few tracks that still leave me scratching my head and you can tell that he is still recovering from the stuff that put him where he was two years ago. I would say this album is a 4* album but i gave it 5 Stars because I liked the direction that EM is heading. Keep It Up EMINEM, If your future songs are like this and you gain you swag back and build momentum on this album then I can't imagine where you will go from here!!!

9626348631|4.0|About the book:  Set near London around the mid-1800's, an artist is traveling to his latest work assignment. On his way he sees a disturbing woman in white on the highway. He attempts to help her but is mystified when she disappears. Her connection with his life becomes apparent over time after he arrives at his destination. There he falls in love with one of the nieces of the household owner. She however is to be married shortly to a man who appear less than genial, creating conflict and angst. Things become convoluted as the plot is conveyed by different individuals that are involved in the happenings in this tale of deceit, murder, and apparent madness.<br /><br />My Thoughts:  I did not realize that this edition was abridged until after finishing it, and perhaps would not have chosen this version if I had realized. I really enjoy listening to classics when exercising since they are often difficult for me to focus on when actually reading.<br /><br />The audio version was lovely nonetheless. The narration was excellent - done by various speakers that had the gender, age, and class accents appropriate to the teller of each section; and they were of course done with wonderful English accents.<br /><br />I was out of breath and shocked at some of the scenes, thought about the book between listens, and I did not guess what was going to happen next which is always a good sign. I also did not feel that the book was edited. I give this audio book 3.5 stars.  I recommend it as a great way to get into classics which may otherwise be difficult to read.

B00000IREA|4.0|Our story opens on Barbarella's spaceship, the Alpha 7, which is furnished, floor to ceiling, with light brown shag carpeting.  Earth tones evidently made a comeback in 40,000 a.d.. The first scene is a unique weightless striptease from a mostly aluminum color spacesuit down to the clothes that Jane Fonda (Barbarella) was born wearing. Presumably, Barbarella had just come in from a spacewalk. It becomes evident as the plot progresses that this striptease is as pertinent as anything else in the film.    Digression: One may have to be a certain age to be able to convey what they're going for here. In 1968, there was the sexual revolution and women's liberation accompanied by a genuine expectation for world peace in a generation or so. Which means... I am trying frame this. Of course there was love and lust, but we didn't have to fear it or judge it. We could see and enjoy the feminine form casually without an ulterior agenda. This was sexual liberation - this was the goal anyway. ...And that's why Barbarella doesn't even think of looking for something to put on when the video phone call from the President of Earth happens. End Digression.    The video phone call comes in from the President of Earth and Rotating Premier of the Sun System, Barbarella stands at attention and salutes. They exchange greetings and then Barbarella offers to put something on, but the President says it's not necessary because it's just government work. He has an assignment for her. She has to find Durand-Durand (not the rock group). He's a scientist. Weapons, which are outlawed by 40,000 a.d., will be required and so the President borrowed some for her from a museum. So we're off to extreme deep space, Tau-Ceti 16, which is on the way to Polaris - or something.    A stranger adventure than we could have ever anticipated lies ahead. End of storyline.    Some of my impressions: The music is dated but good. The soundtrack dubbing seems disjointed from the characters at times. The basis is eroticism rather than science fiction. Some of the futuristic ideas do have appeal. Some sets were thoughtfully built with care to detail, but some were not. Things in the sets such as shag carpeting were considered really nice at the time (I remember). The viewer seems to be the only one hoping for a science fiction classic.    There are some explanations; for example the director (and one of seven screenwriters), Roger Vadim, was in love with the lead. One doesn't really understand the extent of this love until one sees the film. And one tends to forgive the side effects of love most of the time...    In 1968 special effects were often borrowed from the stage, and dialog-driven science fiction was quite acceptable. However, there was a problem, as evidenced by so many writers. Perhaps the transition from comic strip to film is part of the cause. In particular, the scene with the flesh-eating dolls lends itself to a comic strip more readily. The reader of the comic strip can imagine the personalities of the wild children, the dolls, and the rescue; and make it work without effort. In a film, the director has to show all of these factors, make the decisions that imagination automatically makes when reading - and show them. Sometimes it just doesn't flow.    Regarding casting, the Great Tyrant and Durand Durand were great disappointments to me. On the other hand, I thought Fonda, Hemmings, and Sabato had particularly good energy and captured the spirit of the story.    Science fiction of this period had limited special effects. Sometimes it forced a film whose special effects were unintentionally comical to take a \\"why try\\" attitude. This may have happened here at least in a few scenes near the end of the film. I understand from my research that the original comic strip is much more dark than this film is. It would be interesting to see a remake that is faithful to the original comic strip and with better special effects; however, Jane Fonda will always be the Barbarella ofthe '60's.
0143116738|5.0|This book covers the sense you got in school, that something is missing.  Whether you excelled or not, it felt lopsided.  Analyze, contrast and compare, abstraction, regimented.  No context, no creativity.  Untouched in the book, this possibly being the origin of some bullying - a herd of kids stuck in an environment designed around the success of a few, some frustrated to the point of aggression.  Anyways, Ken looks at blazing successes of people who left the sanctioned/promoted domain of math, science, etc. to follow their own natural bend.  Possibly the most important point is brought up in the second half of the last chapter, we're headed in the wrong direction not just in education but in a Avatar/Na'vi way - our relationship with food, health, environment.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|After my few years of LOST watching I have learned not to include spoilers when talking or writing about the show. Peeps should can the spoilers, and if you have not yet viewed the season AVOID them like you would an evil infection.<br /><br />Try not to be swayed by the haters. I will not defend against them, I will only say that season six was without a doubt the most complicated season to grasp as a whole and since that is the case, in the end split the fan base into several directions.<br /><br />Season six deals heavily in the islands mythology. Where season five dealt heavily in time travel and the history of Dharma, six almost releases itself from the grip of time all together. The Jacob/Man In Black theme is expanded and very hard to understand.  ACROSS THE SEA is the culminating point of the island mythology, where a major question was promised to be addressed. Well it was, but the answer that was given shattered the fan base into more pieces then a certain light house mirror that I wont get into specifics about.<br /><br />Lets just say that I believe about 99 point 9 percent of the viewers totally missed the point of Across the Sea. I thought that episode was completely bad ass. Since even the peeps who watched the episode fifty times still think my theory is wrong ands I dont want to include spoilers, You can check out what I really think at Lostblog.net.<br /><br />The production was not as lush as previous seasons in a lot of episodes, (except AB AETERNO, a brilliant Richard centric ep. which shows that Lost could easily remain on air as various movies of the week) and the pacing is way different, but it didn't stop me from watching and rewatching episodes over and over. This is the greatest show of all time, and I loved six as much as others. You should just try and enjoy the ride on the first go through, then assemble the puzzle after. Just remember, where season six may contain fifty puzzle pieces, most peeps just grabbed up three at the end, looked at them for three seconds and then declared that it didn't make any sense. The final episode, while great, isnt the culmination of the mythology presented in the series. And the answer will not smack you in the face as soon as it wraps. It is more likely to wake you up out of a dead sleep several weeks later in a sweat... I get it! Watch and enjoy. That is all.d then declared that it didn't make any sense.

B00275EHJG|3.0|.......................................................................(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS  SPOILERS)..........................                        To make a long story short, I was there for Toy Story 1 and 2, played the video games, had some Toy Story folders, and other merchandise growing up. So you can bet I was excited to see they were coming out with a 3rd Toy Story movie. Went to see it a couple of days ago...and maybe it's because I was a bit tired (Thanks to some people who parked in front of my house at 5:00 AM and woke me up when they started talking and bouncing a basketball while I had my bedroom windows open)that I didn't take to this movie.              First things first, I didn't like the beginning. It seemed very rushed and forced upon you. The toys all started freaking out that they were going to get donated,and that's all we heard. Even if there was little proof of it happening. Then Andy opens the attic door and it closes when he walks away. Andy set the bag with the toys RIGHT UNDER THE PULL DOWN ATTIC DOOR and his mom just assumes it's garbage and puts it on the curb?!?! Okay, she didn't take notice of where the bag was at?!?! I mean, maybe Andy didn't get the time yet to open up the attic door and put his toys away!!??!               Also, a LOT of cool toys from the original two movies are gone,which is to be expected.  kids do get rid of stuff overtime and a lot of parents love putting things out for yard sales, but the problem is no one is there in their place. Sure they tried to put other toys in this movie from the day care or from Bonnie's house, but MOST of those toys, beside the hedgehog, Ken, and Hugs-A-Lot Bear have little or no on screen time for you to get a feel for them as a character, learn their personality, or become attached to them. They are just bland faces. I'd rather have Wheezy, Etch-A-Skeetch, the little blue robot, RC Car, the small plastic snake, and LASTLY BO PEEP....Getting rid of Bo Peep was dumb. She was a pretty big secondary character right next to Ham, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head. Also, Hugs a Lot is a complete Jerk...in every sense of the word. He doesn't even bring across that \\"love to hate them\\" type feeling, like \\"Darth Vader\\" or other really cool bad guys. He's just extremely mean and down-right nasty, especially considering what he did at the end of this film. I hated having him in this movie!               Which brings me to next point, without interesting characters, the clever banter and humor between toys was missing in this one. No funny one liners or jokes that adults would only get. Just BLAH. Oh sure, the story had a plot and it unfolded decently, and the characters said enough, but I was looking for it to be fun along the way as well.             Another thing is, the childhood innocence Andy had while playing with his toys in the first two movies is missing. Instead, Andy is grown up and we have his replacement Bonnie, whom I just didn't like. She seemed goofy...and I hate to say that about a child character, but I just didn't care for her at all. When she was playing with the toys it made me feel weird, awkard, and uncomfortable.            Which brings me to my last reason for not really liking this movie, the ending. I wanted Andy to go put his toys in the attic, and then the toys live on together and are happy. One day down the road, Andy would be going through the Attic, come upon his old toys, pull them out, and fall in love all over again. He might have even tracked down another Etch a Sketch, Bo Peep doll, or RC car that he keeps at his own house for his kids or because he regretted giving them away.    BUT...I didn't get that sense of closure. So give me something else worthwhile!           Pixar and Disney said, \\"NO!\\" So what happens is Andy is going to put his toys in the Attic, but Woody puts a post it note on the box to please donate the toys. So Andy takes them Bonnie's house and they play with the toys together. Now I think this part of the movie was really botched...We could have seen Andy playing with his toys again FOR OLD TIMES SAKE, possibly in slow motion and accompanied to some slow and mellow music. Maybe we could have seen some flashbacks to when he played with them before, when he was younger. You know something to really makes us feel sad about the loss of childhood innocence that has taken place? But instead, Andy plays with the toys as if he doesn't really care, no real emotion what so ever. Like it's no big deal.            Then he goes back to his car, and gets in. He's looking at his toys for a long time with a VERY sad look in his face because he's leaving behind toys he still wants. I kept saying to myself,\\" Go back for them then if you are going to miss them!!!\\" But Andy just drives off, the toys stand on Bonnie's front porch, and the camera pans upward toward the sky...THAT'S MY SENSE OF CLOSURE?!?          Then random clips of the toys enjoying their new life comes out and we some of the humor that was so lacking in the film. In my opinion, this movie's ending was horrible. What Pixar should have done is added all the credit scenes of the toys enjoying their new life to the end of the film, and made that the end. You know, a sense of closure that the toys were going to be all right. Maybe have \\"You've got a friend in me\\" playing to the montage to let us know things are back the way they used to be and the toys are enjoying themselves again.           But instead, this movie's end feels like a set up for a new movie...I sense Toy Story is going to head the way of A LOT of Disney movies and go down the path of not as appealing, quick cash in, Direct to Video sequels. Toy Story 3 was ALMOST a direct to video movie...So I wouldn't be surprised at all if this happened! So forget about me getting that sense of closure I was talking about earlier, instead I got a way for Disny and Pixar to dig the franchise up and bring it back to life whenever they want to! Life Lesson 101: Sometimesit's good when something good ends before it has the chance of going on for too long and becoming stale.                      I did however, like the idea of Mrs. Potato Head using her missing eye to see Andy, and how Mr. Potato head transferred himself to a wrap for a taco...but did anyone else think he looked like the Mr. Potato head parody character on Mad Tv's old spoof of Toy Story? Coincidence?           Also, I did like the part near the end where the toys were going to get melted. They did that well,and it really had me worried and brought out some emotion in me. Thus, making me care. Thus, making me like that scene.          Overall, I liked this movie. But it can't hold a candle to the first toy released years ago. However, I'd still recommend seeing it at least once, or buying a copy when it released.
B003F3NE1Q|4.0|I've watched the whole season on tv and it was just a typical grey's anatomy season. More drama and comedy between the characters, but I see that they have grown a lot since season 1. The only episode that I loved the most was the finale - It was very well acted and intensifying. It was very overwhelming the whole time and I highly recommend that everyone watches it - even the non-grey's fan. Very powerful and moving, and very sucessful. Can't wait for the next season.    This is a good addition to your grey's anatomy collection and I recommend that you buy it.
1595825045|5.0|The book is excellent! The quality is top-notch. The pages are nice and thick, the printing brings the amazing drawings to life, and the coffee table size of it is perfect for the content, which is incredible. I've never seen a single source that gives more in-depth, behind the scenes information on the series than this book. And it's narrated by the creators themselves! If you're a fan of the series, you would definitely enjoy this.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I watched this movie quite some time ago in theater, and felt it was so-so. However, re-watching the director-cut version on Blue-ray makes me feel like I am watching a dramatically different movie (much better than theatrical version of course).

0307245306|3.0|I listened to this book on tape whilst doing a 540 mile bike ride through the mountains.  As 90% of my focus was dedicated to not dying, this book was perfect for the remaining 10%.  Light, creative, fun and moved along at a nice clip.  My only complaint was that it was a little formulaic.  A trio of friends embarks on a quest equipped with magical weapons and faced with a horde of bad guys that pop up when you most expect it.<br />The only part I found to be strange is the author decides to characterize the son of Poseidon as ADHD and dyslexic.  I suppose he was trying to make the story meaningful to today's youth, but if you're going to go that route, why not just round out the character with a super human prescription for Ritalin?
0679805273|5.0|My daughter received this book for her high school graduation.  When she first opened it, we were puzzled.  But as we read it, we realized how very funny it was &  what a great message for a graduate, or anyone really.  What a great unique gift!
030745455X|3.0|This is second book in the Millennium trilogy.  When we last left our intrepid and erudite polymath protagonist, she had just helped the reporter Mikael Blomkvist solve a case that had gone unsolved for 40 years and during the process, exonerated Mr. Blomkvist of all wrongdoings wrought upon him by a megalomaniacal CEO.  We learned little of Ms. Lisbeth Salander, the protagonist, in the first novel.  In the second one, her background is fleshed out a bit more --- we are introduced to her father and half-brother, both of who are intent on ensuring her demise.  However, armed with her characteristic spunk and a large sum of money pilfered from the aforementioned CEO's account, Ms. Salander is a force to consider.  She not only stays a step ahead of law enforcement and other assorted characters who are looking for her, but she also finds the time to solve Fermat's Last Theorem just the way Fermat would have solved it --- by using 17th century mathematics and not the 20th century advanced mathematics used by Prof. A. Wiles to solve the previously unsolved conjecture.  But just like Fermat, I think Lisbeth Salander ran out of room in the margin of her notebook to write the proof.  Instead, what we are left with are simple linear equations of the first degree and finding roots of quadratic equations.<br /><br />In summary, this is okay reading albeit a bit too long.  A strong editing session would have made the length more bearable while keeping the story line intact.  If you liked the first book, this will not disappoint.  (May 2010)
B00000AF98|4.0|This disc attempted and succeeded at capturing the type of hard rock metal that was very popular at the time. In fact it was quite a hit and although some people don't like bands like winger, poison, and others. Those bands put out some great music.<br />I rebel against the fact that only superpoorly sung music is good metal.<br />OF course thrash has some decent moments but it only deserves to be far less popular than any melodic metal in my book.  Now the last four kiss discs were not as light as this one but this is melodic metal that leans toward pop and that's ok. But not every song on this is that type of music either.  I personally like the harder type of melodic metal more than this but it's still good at what it does. and The tour that year was great too. I saw them in Oklahoma City and it was sold out and a blast. Noone at the time seemed to dislike this one at all. It is a good kiss metal disc with fun songs. Although I would like to have have them go harder a bit they made a good decision at the time and it paid off in another hit disc.<br />It had the hit 'crazy, crazy nights'  and other good songs like 'bang, bang you\\"<br />Kiss wouldn't turn back to a more hardened sound until the great revenge but this is a good example of it's type of metal done kiss style. But like 'unmasked' if you don't like pop then you shouldn't buy that one.  And this one is for people who also liked poison and other bands topping the charts at the time.
030745455X|5.0|Loved this book!  I thought the first one, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" started out a little slow, however, by the middle of the book I couldn't put it down.  I went out the same day to buy the second one and got completely lost in it.  After reading the first one, I wanted to know more about the characters and relationships and Lisbeth fascinated me!  I would definitely recommend that whole series (pre-ordered and already finished the third book) and the books spurred me to jump back full force into reading.

B00007LTIG|4.0|From the opening of The Golden Road, you are thrust into an energetic album which marked the beginning of the long trip that was The Grateful Dead. This album doesn't capture what the Dead were like in concert at the time, or much of what they would become, but it is an eclectic mix of songs which showcase the wide range of material they were playing at the time, as mainly a cover band. We get things like old prison songs, blues, and folk songs (played with a signature psychedelic rock edge) mixed with a couple originals like The Golden Road and Cream Puff War. Viola Lee Blues expanded the boundaries of length for a rock song of the time, features fiery guitar soloing by Jerry Garcia, and offers a glimpses of the band's future improvisational nature. Basically it's all good, even if some of the songs sound a bit rushed.    On the CD reissue, we also get 5 great unreleased tracks from the recording sessions, both an edited and a live version of Viola Lee Blues, not to mention a number of the songs from the album have been extended past their original fade-outs. It's a great package, if you don't expect to hear the Dead like they sounded later, I promise you won't be disappointed.
B000094A6A|3.0|Just a bit corny for me. Like Animal House. That doesn't mean someone else wouldn't like it.I still don't know what the point of the movie was. Need a definite taste for this movie. Bought from Amazon,as soon as I saw Will Farrell was  in it. He's done better. I did enjoy Steve Carell's role.<br />However, it is a no brainer with a few laughs in it.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Great movie - the folks in the youth playing High School students have a lot of fun and have lots of sexual connotation through the movie.  Good entertainment for the young at heart.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|DEVO is hands down one of my favorite bands.  I am that rare breed of DEVO fan that actually likes \\"Smooth Noodle Maps,\\" and owns the extremely rare \\"Re-Combo DNA\\" set.  I think they call people like me \\"DEVO-TEEs.\\"  Seems fitting.  Needless to say, the news of a new DEVO album was very welcome.    \\"Something for Everybody\\" was brilliantly marketed.  DEVO conducted a series of focus groups via their website to determine their new look, album design, and energy dome color.  They also held a \\"song study\\" in which fans could vote for their favorite of the new tracks.  The idea behind the song study was pretty genius.  Unfortunately, the band neglected to follow their fans wise advice, and a true stinker made its way onto the album, (\\"Cameo\\").  My hunch is that the track listing for the album had already been determined, and that the song study was simply a marketing ploy.  Considering the voting ended just over a month before the album's scheduled release, one would conclude that it would be nearly impossible to get all the discs pressed, artwork printed, cds packaged, and shipped to distributors in such a narrow time frame.    That's my only complaint here.  \\"Cameo\\" is a terrible song, (one of the worst from DEVO's entire catalog).  If it weren't for that one misstep, I'd declare this the best DEVO album of all.  Tracks like \\"Later Is Now,\\" \\"Human Rocket,\\" \\"Mind Games,\\" and \\"What We Do\\" are soooooo DEVO.  I really love this album, and love the fact that my favorite band is back in full(est) effect.  One bad song out of 12 is a pretty good ratio.  Buy this album spuds.  DUTY NOW!!!

1439153663|3.0|This book was recommended by a friend and, based on the blurb, I was anxious to read it since I love American history.  Early on, I honestly considered stopping.  It seemed slow and I felt oddly removed from the characters.  Everyone seemed at arm's length so I was having trouble connecting to anyone emotionally.  But I was curious enough about what would happen to Lavinia that I plugged on and was glad I did.  Around 60% of the way through the book, I began to connect with Lavinia and Belle, though never completely.  I continue to feel that the writing style kept the reader removed from the action of the book.  Several events were described to the readers after the fact rather than having us \\"witness\\" them first hand.  Also, I like a book to have a little more of a positive or hopeful nature.  I understand that a book about slavery is not going to be sunshine and roses, but it becomes exhausting emotionally when nothing good occurs throughout all this time (for example, even 'Schindler's List' finds a way to be positive and hopeful).  Peraps giving Will Stephens a larger role would have made the difference; instead, his involvement was almost incidental and never made a real impact.  Finally, I was a bit frustrated by the past tense telling of the story on Lavinia's part.  She refers several times to what she knows now that she didn't know then.  So,I was looking forward to hearing more later in the book about the time she is writing and what perspective she is writing from, but that is never clearly explained.  It would have been better if had been told in real time.<br /><br />The story, characters and time period are fascinating, so I am glad I read the book, but I'm not sure whether I would recommend it to a friend.

I don't know where I'm going, but I follow the breadcrumbs left behind, hoping to find answers. But all I find are the ones, who are after me. I tried to run, but I'm trapped like a mouse in the maze, going in endless circles. I don't know who I am, but I know that I am not the killer that they believe me to be. But the darkness now surrounds me, and the city is spiraling under their control. And my back is to the wall. My childhood moments paint a brilliant picture, but I am left alone in the dark. But my heart finds her, but there is nowhere for us to go. And to save her life, I would have no choice but to surrender, but what would they do to me? I am held to their mercy, but his deception carries a syringe of truth, knowledge that could set me free. And now I know who I am.
0071636080|3.0|All of the useful tips in the book can be distilled into a single theme: preparation.  The amount of preparation the suggestions call for isn't always an option in fast-paced environments.  This book is a must-read for entrepreneurs who have to \\"sell\\" to investors, and definitely has useful suggestions, but there aren't any silver bullets.<br /><br />Book would have been much more impactful if purged of the references to Al Gore's environmental agenda - anyone who disagrees with that divisive topic could find those parts of the book to be credibility-damaging distractions away from the helpful messages.
B0035F0MTG|4.0|'Transformation'--well, the music on this disc may be transformational, as Yuja Wang claims in the booklet notes, but I believe the pianist herself is even more in transformation. Her [[ASIN:B001OBBSQY debut album]] on DG was auspicious enough to warrant purchase of the sequel. That said, her second album is quite extraordinary.<br /><br />Her technical prowess was already confirmed by the debut album--an absolute prerequisite to tackling the taxing textures of the Petrushka Movements and the Paganini Variations. Her Stravinsky is technically accomplished, although the last degree of technical control cannot yet fully compare with that of Kissin and [[ASIN:B000001GQK Pollini]]. Nonetheless, if Kissin's is a barnstormer and Pollini's a blueprint, what Wang adds is a sense of youthful positivity--as Santa Fe listener accurately notes, she is most light and sparkling.<br /><br />Brahms's somewhat unwieldy Paganini Variations requires the performer to invest almost as much fingerwork but more often than not yields far less. Aware of the problem--'the impression of a series of academic etudes, and, instead, creating a big perspective'--Wang acknowledges structural inspiration from Michelangeli, following his idea (in principal supported by Clara Schumann) of rearranging Variations 13 & 14 from Book I to the very end, scrapping Variation 14 from Book II, and inserting Variations 3 & 4 from Book II right before. As for musical inspiration, she needs no role models: this is easily the most successful reading of the work I have heard (including most extant versions)--combining audacious virtuosity with exciting and coherent forward-momentum. [[ASIN:B0000064YB Kissin]] is even more brilliant in the most ferocious numbers, but his rather literal approach does not give the work the kind of helping hand it so desperately needs.<br /><br />The recorded sound caught at Friedrich-Ebert-Halle in January this year is very good (if a bit too close as nearly always with DG), and so are the Scarlatti Sonatas and the Ravel La Valse. I do not mean to be picky--Wang is still only 23 years old--but neither rise to the level of individuality she attains in the Brahms and parts of the Stravinsky. Hence, if she can keep up the current pace of prodigious transformation, her third album may turn out to be a landmark. Together with Yevgeny Sudbin, I believe Yuja Wang is the most talented pianist of the post-Kissin generation, born in the 1980s.<br /><br />Apparently, this disc was very well received by the British critics--becoming both the Gramophone Editor's Choice and the BBC Music Magazine Disc of the Month for July. I hope this is due to a genuine appreciation of her rare pianistic achievement rather her ideal fit with a politically correct stereotype...<br /><br />REFERENCES: Brahms--This One; Stravinsky--[[ASIN:B000AYEJ08 Kissin]]; Ravel--[[ASIN:B0000VM3Y0 Lortie]]<br /><br />PS1: All the works on this album can be found on YouTube in a live recording of her August 2009 Verbier Festival recital (divided into 12 parts--La Valse is from the 2008 recital, though). There is little difference in either conception or execution; the live format adds another degree in temperature, although the last Paganini Variation becomes somewhat approximate in parts thanks to the furious tempo.<br /><br />PS2: I got my copy of this disc at Borders in Singapore. The interesting thing is that it was not filed under Classical Music but rather the neighbouring 'Classical Music Meets Easy Listening' category (cannot remember the exact wording)--together with two Lang Lang discs as well as (which is even more interesting, unless it had ended up there my mistake) Kissin's Russian recital of 2005.

030726999X|5.0|Steig Larrson created one of the most interesting characters I've ever experienced in any novel, Lizbeth Salander.  He keeps her, and all of the characters you've met in this series true to form, while giving them room to develop.<br />This book tied together all the loose ends of the other two while keeping you on the edge of your seat, even when certain events are entirely predictable.<br />In this book, Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter, attempts to prove all charges against Salander, who had been accursed of murder, attempted murder, assault, and who had been confined to an mental institution, not only had no merit, but that she was essentially a victim for many years of her life because of the government's attempt to protect a Russian spy who defected and sought asylum in Sweden.  This spy was so important, that despite his illegal behavior, a section of the Swedish secret police were willing to kill, obstruct justice and abuse the rights of his daughter, Salander.<br />There were many subplots and intrigues, creating a very good read.<br />I am very sad that Larsson died an untimely death.

It tells a very special story about a critical time in the history of South Africa, when the system of apartheid had recently been eliminated.

Morgan Freeman should have won an academy award for his portrayal of Nelson Mandela.  Matt Damon is believable as a rugby player.  If you liked sports movies like \\"Hoosiers\\" or \\"Miracle\\" you will enjoy this movie!

030726999X|4.0|I really enjoyed all three of Larsson's books.  All of the \\"good guys\\" are just really great characters you kind of wish you knew.  I think wish fulfillment is probably the reason these books are so appealing to begin with.  There is conflict, but most of the good characters come out on top easily and are usually a step ahead of the bad guys.  To top it off, they're brilliants journalists or the most elite of hackers with the skills of ninjas who rise above, award themselves millions of dollars and go on Ikea shopping sprees.  (Think about it, and you'll know I am 100% correct in that sentence.) That's just fun stuff no matter how you cut it.<br /><br />Ok, so my only criticism of \\"Hornet's Nest\\" is that it picks up where the last book left off.  The problem for me was that it's been a year or more since I read that book.  I had a lot of trouble remembering what exactly happened, who the characters were, etc;  I think this would be a much better read if you have the chance to open it immediately after reading the Girl who Played with Fire.<br /><br />Quick, fun and easy read though.  Don't be surprised if you finish it in two or three days.

081297381X|3.0|If you make money in Wall Street, whether it be in derivatives or hedge funds (as Taleb made his fame), you will probably want to be read another book written by Taleb, \\"Dynamic Hedging\\" written in 1997. Otherwise, I have a few other suggests for you at the end of this review.    I read this book with interest, but I now wish that I didn't buy it because I regret the dollars that I spent in support of someone so shamefully irresponsible, dishonest and unethical. To Taleb's credit, the book is well written and it contains many good examples and good ideas. However, I found many comments throughout the book to be inaccurate, biased and offensive. The book is riddled with contradictions that seem to be purposely included in order to sell books with sensational (yet inaccurate) messages.  He makes ridiculous statements like \\". . . the bell curve . . . is [the] . . . Great Intellectual Fraud.\\" I am appalled at the extreme bias this book has toward statistics and statisticians. Taleb often starts with a good idea, something that statisticians are very much aware of, and then criticizes statistical theory and statisticians in general with broad statements that are simply not true. Much of Taleb's style is like saying Newton was a moron and a fraud because quantum mechanics has proven him wrong. Keeping with this analogy, Tabeb would have said that you wasted your time if you studied Newton in school--as he suggests about anyone who took a statistics course in college. Here is an excerpt from the book..\\"If you ever took a (dull) statistics class in college, did not understand much of what the professor was excited about, and wondered what \\"standard deviation\\" meant, there is nothing to worry about. The notion of standard deviation is meaningless outside of Mediocristan.\\" The only problem is that much of our world does fit well with what he calls Mediocristan as he admits himself just 6 pages later, and in other places of the book. So why say that you wasted your time taking a statistics course in college? Taleb uses many examples from empirical psychological research to make his points throughout the book and says that psychologists are \\"...lucky, since most of their variables allow for the application of conventional Gaussian statistics.\\" So, how can the Gaussian distribution be the \\"Great Intellectual Fraud\\" if it is a major player in good psychological research--even good enough for this statistician bashing author to site numerous times throughout his book? Unfortunately, there are far too many of these unacceptable statements in the book to mention--many of which are more egregious than what I have mentioned. I was so outraged by this book that I considered voicing my complaints in writing. Fortunately, that has already been done by many people. I urge anyone to read the August 2007 (volume 61, issue 3) issue of The American Statistician before they read this book. Some of the inaccuracies of the book are outlined in the journal and, as a contributor to the journal issue, Taleb clarifies what he meant to say in the book--or at least rephrases his message more accurately and concisely. After reading the few short articles in The American Statistician, you will learn most of what the book has to offer. Statisticians give Taleb credit for highlighting the lurking dangers of extreme outliers and the fact that some things, like the stock market, are susceptible to these Black Swans. As Taleb points out, statistics based on the Gaussian distribution do not work with this type of data. In this respect, Taleb is on the same side as statisticians. Taleb and statisticians alike are hard at work trying to educate people on this point. Essentially all statistics textbooks and statistics classes include precise statements about the assumptions of statistics and statistics based on the Gaussian distribution are no exception. In my view, Taleb's book will provide statistics professors some engaging examples to use when they are giving examples that violate the assumptions of Gaussian-based statistics. The danger with this book is that one has to be highly trained in statistics to sift through the trash to find the message that is worth reading.      Be warned, however, that the other interesting parts of the book are also littered with biases. For example, he throws in a lot of insults at French and Russian people--I have no idea why because they did not contribute anything but a sense of bigotry. Taleb's writing is so negative and biased one has reason to question his character--which is not hard to do given the well-known shortcomings of      In conclusion, besides reading the issue in The American Statistician mentioned above, I think that anyone that might be interested in the content of \\"The Black Swan\\" would be interested in the following two books that are infinitely more accurate, informative and useful. These two books are also much less likely to offend you or get under your skin.    \\"The Drunkard's Walk. How Randomness Rules our Lives\\" By Leonard Mlodinow.  \\"The Lady Tasting Tea. How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century\\" by David Salsburg.

0312370849|3.0|I read this book in two evenings. It was a very engaging story and easy to get caught up in. However, I have to admit that I was more interested in reading the story of the girl who gets arrested with her family in 1942 than I was to read about Julia, the journalist in France circa 2002.<br /><br />The girls story is gripping, harrowing, shocking, disturbing and all too real. I had not known the history of the Vel d'Hiv before picking up this book and I was appalled to learn what happened there. Although reading about those events was upsetting, I am glad that I now know about it. The main point of this book, I believe, was that we should never forget the events that happened that July night in 1942. We should never forget the evils done by our fellow man, no matter how brutal, no matter how sickening. Because when we forget, we allow all of those men, women and children to die in vain and we open the door to history repeating itself.<br /><br />The story of Julia, on the other hand, was interesting but lacking in substance for me. Maybe it is because I cannot stand female characters who make up excuses to stay with worthless men. Despite Julia's other good qualities in the book, this one fact made me dislike her. In the end, she redeemed herself to an extent, but I still had a hard time believing that her learning about the events of the Vel d'Hiv and her husband's family's connection with that night changed her life so profoundly. While it was a nice parallel story, it was a bit difficult to believe.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book for the historical significance and for the touching and heart wrenching story of the girl who locked her brother in the cupboard. Her story will certainly be on my mind for a long time.

030726999X|5.0|When I began reading this trilogy, I shrugged and said to myself, so what's so great about these books? My respect was won by reading \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" although I guessed the ending one-third of the way into the book. The second book was different and darker, if possible. And there didn't seem to be a very clear plot line: just lots of grisly murkiness going back and forth between plot and flashbacks. So it was a little bit of a letdown.<br /><br />With this third book, the author, Stieg Larsson, has really come into his own. He handles a plot that has clusters of multiple characters, all with Scandanavian names which are hard to remember. But as you go along you find yourself remembering who they are (and congratulate yourself) because Larsson has done such a masterful job of characterization. The plot hops back and forth between what looks to me as FOUR major groups and still, you can manage to keep them straight. The narrative line has so much complexity, yet the characterizations are even more finely delineated than in the first two books. There's less fuzziness around who the characters truly are. And, BTW, the four groups are just about the major storyline, not the sub-stories and the backstories. He must have had SO MUCH FUN writing this book!<br /><br />There has been speculation that maybe Larsson didn't die of natural causes. Well, if there was a conspiracy to assassinate him, then the clues are all in this last volume. Even if no one in Sweden wants to go there anymore. It is a shame that he didn't live to see how readers have responded to his work. There is one other note, though--which is that the novels are SO feminist, that I wonder how much influence Eva Gabriellson had on the writing. They were together for thirty years and it seems that no single man could come up with this much outrage about women's civil and criminal rights just by himself. The irony being that this kind of feminist tract is much more striking and palpable written by a male author than had it been written by a female one. Were the writer female, then everyone would complain that its message is too strong and whiney. Coming from a male writer like Larsson, the medium is the message. what great irony!<br /><br />I read all three books in a weekend plus a couple of days. I'm glad that I had a chance to do that, because if you had read them when they were first released, you would have had to wait a few years between the volumes. Reading them back to back or front to front as I did--the development of his writing technique from book to book is so much fun to observe and to appreciate! Of course, he might not have written them in linear order either. In any case, the books are a gold mine of inspiration for writers like myself. Really go for it is his message as an author, and don't hold back!<br /><br />Kudos to Stieg Larsson. He has contributed a whole lot to Swedish politics. I wonder, though, if anyone is really looking into it? Never mind. His expose although fictionalised reminds me of a quotation from Ralph Waldo Emerson:  \\"Fiction reveals the truth that reality obscures.\\"hor than had it been written by a female one.

B003ELOQCA|2.0|Having been to the Boston/Foxboro 360 show, I was pumped to see that this DVD had been released and couldn't wait to relive the show.  Bottom line is that this looks like a 2 hour commercial or a music video.  The director and/or producers are not at all concerned with attempting to document what it was like to see this amazing concert but make it a point to show us what fancy editing and camera magic they can do.  It is \\"cleaned up\\" so much that you can't even hear the audience at all for the majority of the show.  The only thing good about this DVD is the setlist, but it is painful to watch.  Hopefully, the band releases another DVD of this tour and direct the director to make it more realistic looking with some great shots from a crowd standpoint.  There is not even an intro segment that shows the amazing stage in light, the gigantic crowd, or the band even coming on stage.  I would pick the Boston 2001 or even the Pop Mart Tour DVDs over this one any day.
0385340567|1.0|I've read all of the other Jack Reacher books over the past couple of years, and this one is different from all the others. It is like someone else wrote the book, Reacher acts completely different than he has before. There are a ton of plot holes in this book, I'll give a few examples.    First, everyone in the town of Despair are morons. Reacher comes and goes breaks into buildings, burns down the police station and beats up at least 20 people in full view of everyone. So why don't they just call the state police on him? All they have to say was that he beat up the towns only deputy and need back up. There problem solved Reachers in jail for the next 5-10 years.    Second, you find out all the missing guys in the book are army deserters who are smuggled out of the united states to avoid going back to Iraq. To do this they hide out in a \\"hidden compartment\\" in a semi-truck. Why didn't they just drive accrossed the boarder? They wouldn't be stopped if they just went acrossed in their car and said they were going on vacation. If they were to sneak over why would they get into this hidden compartment a few hundered miles away from the boarder? Why not get in 5 mins from the board then get out 5 mins after not spend a day in a tiny compartment?    Third, The MP base. Why would the army put a base to keep track of the Uranium but not have someone at the metal plant to oversee it? What were they suppose to do on the road? They didn't search any trucks leaving so saddam hussein himself could have driven a truck to the plant picked up all the uranium and driven out, the MPs just sat in their base and every month had the plant manager send them a letter telling them how much was in there.     Fourth what is with Reacher, He spends the first half of the book a few parts per million of TCE in Hopes drinking water but then dedonates a dirty bomb 1 town over?    Finally it takes about 20 seconds to look up tank losses in Iraq which means the truth is we have lost very few tanksand even fewer people in the tanks. No tanks were lost during the entire invasion part of the war and only 80 tanks have been taken out of action by enemy fire. These fires which burn the people inside of the tanks to ash dont happen, an IED would only knock a tread off the tank and leave the people inside fine. The M1A1 is the safest tank in the world, the tanks that were taken out of action were because of the treads being knock off or the engines being hit, which means everyone inside was fine.    This book is not like any other Reacher book, in most people ask him for help and he is finally talked into it but here nobody wants his help but he sticks around looking for any reason continue beating people up and breaking down doors.    This book had way to many fist fights in them and they got so boring after a while because they were all the same, \\"5 guys jumped Reacher he beats them all then makes snide comments after\\" nobody ever pulls a gun and only one pulled a knife even the cops he beats up. The ending is the worst ever, it's like he got to the last chapter and was like \\"o no i have to wrap this up in 5 mins and came up with the worst ending ever.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|After the first few spins of the entire album I did not fully embrace Eminem's new 2010 release Recovery. Prior releases Relapse (2009) and even Encore (2004) were dumb at moments lyrically but they had that signature Eminem rap, rhythm, flow and energy to them that we all grown to love about Em. Anyways back to Recovery at times it had to much of a pop feel. Having Kobe no not the nba champion, pink and rihanna on hooks. But, at the same time Em ripped some dynamite verses on those tracks with tons of energy. Besides that I believe the rest of the album is close to perfect. Tracks I really thought were dope besides of course the single \\"Not Afraid\\" were \\"Cold Wind Blows\\", \\"No Love\\" ft. Lil Wayne, \\"On Fire\\", \\"So Bad\\", \\"Untitled\\", etc. You can tell he really stepped up and raised his and the whole rap games bar lyrically. \\"Not Afraid\\" he raps \\" I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it/ You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely/ Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club/ Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up/ Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon/ But I'm too busy gazing at stars\\". I purchased the deluxe edition of Recovery and I believe those 2 tracks should of made the regular album they are hot. Now after listening to Recovery a dirty dozen times. I have grown to like it alot more welcome back to your throne fire Marshall.

B002ZG997M|5.0|This is a terrific film with a few distracting points.  The mostly bland almost black & white filming leaves something to be desired.  It does, however, convey the image of the earth after a major war.  There is an underlying religious theme that will not be noticed by some, and loved by others.  It brings to light various things in this vein. It is a film that requires your complete attention otherwise the ending as one critic states may not register.  I plan on viewing it again to see If I can pick up any things I may have missed during the first viewing. There will be widely different feelings on this film.  Watch it and relay your opinion.

B003A4IFDW|5.0|After three strong studio albums, the digital only \\"Change Is Gonna Come Sessions\\", and a wealth of back material, Bettye has finally made the classic I knew she always would.    Stripped on their bombast, Bettye has taken on thirteen of some of the most familiar Brit-rock songs, and made them her own.  I know, we've heard these songs thousands of times, which is less a critique of the original recordings and more a critique of decades of unimaginative radio programming.    I've never heard Ms. Lavette more focussed, more natural, more absolutely perfect than on this album.  She's toned herself down enough to put the lyrics across without them being swallowed up by those astonishing things she can do with her voice.  (She can channel Nina Simone or Screamin' Jay Hawkins anytime she wants to, but wisely chooses not to here.).    I'm hearing these songs for the first time again.  \\"All My Love\\", \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", \\"Nights In White Satin\\".  The instrumentation is so lightly touched that Bettye gets right to the heart of what these songwriters had in mind in the first place.    Well, IMO, all the songs are fantastic.  Two of them give me chills.  \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and the live bonus \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\".  They are beautifully performed, perfectly performed.    She hasn't usurped the British catalogue.  She's made these old, classic rock saws vital again.  She's getting high praise from the original performers, and she deserves every bit of it.  Who remembers that these words were so great?  Who knew that \\"Nights In White Satin\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" could be stripped so bare, so emotional?    Bettye does concept albums well.  All of her recent work had a concept.  That means, to steal a phrase, all killer-no filler (apologies to Jerry Lee).  She got this idea after performing \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\" at the Kennedy Center.  She had originally hoped to sing for George Jones there. (\\"Choices\\" was a highlight from \\"The Scene Of The Crime\\").  So, here's a wish.  Ms. Lavette, you are at the top of your game.  How about a concept album of country after this?      Well, folks, Bettye can go anywhere she wants to after this.  Meantime, she's given us a classic here, in every sense of the word.  I'm a true believer on this one.  Buy It!
B000I9WWJA|3.0|Look I like Denzel Washington and will watch any of his movies any time of day, but INSIDE MAN is another story. I love the bank robber dramas, especially when that robber is smart and witty. Clive Owen does a good job acting as this intelligent bank robber. The movie was a little slow to me and used the F - word way to much. However, the movie had its moments; I kept wondering how is this guy (Owen) going to escape this bank when there are like a million cops outside? Actually, the way he did it was pretty awesome. The ending was good but it did tick me off a little bit! You will just have to watch to find out.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|I got Celebration for my birthday, then my neighbor was kind enough to give me a copy of Ray Of Light, then I decided to get all her other CDs and give copies to my neighbor so we'd both have the ultimate collection.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />The moment I heard this CD, I knew the title song was good, but then the whole thing surprised me by being an awesome collection. This and Bedtime Stories are now tied for my second favorite Madonna album.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole album is full of fast-paced makes-you-wanna-dance numbers (Like A Virgin, Material G irl, Dress You Up, etc.) as well as a few slow-paced but still lovable tracks (Angel, Love Don't Live Here Anymore).<br /><br />It doesn't matter whether you're from the 80's and some how have managed to not buy this album or from the 90's-00's, this album is a keeper for anybody who needs something fun to dance to. I recommend it to anybody. :)
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I really like the suspense of the movei and the story line was well thought out and written.Everything is taken place in this post - apocalyptic world with DENZEL as the main character, ELI.  The actors were chosen carefully, it seemed because the actors just dived into these charaters personalities!! It reminded me of the book \\"Farenhiet 451\\", by Ray Bradbury. Of how books were outlawed and burned and everything was organized by color and numbers. What an awesome movie from beginning to end. It just showed how human beings can become animals and power hungry when something goes out of whack! The plot was that this one book - turning out to be the Bible - is what this fiend is looking for. His reasoning was that this could be used as a weapon - IS a weapon. Of course, you will have to watch the movie to understand why that is. GREAT MOVIE, GREAT ACTING, WONDERFUL STORY LINE/PLOT. OH AND THE ENDING WAS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. But of course you will have to watch the movie to figure out why!
B003K025V4|5.0|I've been a Miley fan since the beginning and I loved her last 2 albums, so I HAD to get this the moment it came out yesterday at K Mart.<br /><br />Anyway, most of the songs are about self-confidence and breaking free (Robot, Liberty Walk) and of course we have to have romance songs, right? ;) From break-up songs (Two More Lonely People, Every Rose Has Its Thorn, Scars) to in love songs (Forgiveness And Love, My Heart Beats For Love) this album doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Whether you like Miley or not, this album is still a great choice for pop lovers. Once you start on Liberty Walk, each song will keep you going up to the end of My Heart Beats For Love.<br /><br />This is NOT the album for those who are there for G-rated, clean Miley. She says the H word in Can't Be Tamed and s**y in Permanent December but she still doesn't get as \\"bad\\" as Talk Is Cheap in the previous CD. However, none of these things affect the amazing-ness of the album. She will be 18 in November after all, so like the title says, we can't tame her. ;)<br /><br />While Miley has said her \\"break\\" from music is only going to last 1-2 years, this is a FANTASTIC conclusion to Miley's Hollywood Records contract. :) All pop-lovers should own this CD. :D<br /><br />P.S. If you found this or any of my reviews unhelpful, please tell me why in the comments so I can improve it.
B000W43FPG|5.0|This movie was a brilliantly directed. Something I hate with Greek Mythology transformed from paper to on - screen is the horrible acting and false reperesentation/translation. There was none of that in TROY!! Brad Pitt (not my favorite) did a good job portraying the tyrant warrior ACHILLES. Eric Bana(one of my favorites) portrayed the heart of gold prince of Troy, HECTOR, just as beautifully. This movie has everything in it action, romance, tension, and suspense. If you love mythology or find it interesting and care for the DRAMATIC GENRE, THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU!!

B000Y96EWK|5.0|This movie is sweet!! I own all three of the movies and loe watching them. With this suspense ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT mystery movie there is no nudity. I hate it when a movie comes out and then in the middle of it there is a sex scene! Totally ruins the whole movie. However, in ALL THE BOURNE movies there are car chases, shoot outs, mystery and suspense over and over again. Matt Damon does a wonderful job playing the mysterious agent JASON BOURNE and kicks butt along the way!! What is also really cool is when you watch it you'll notice he doesn't really kill anyone...he simply kicks the crap out of them. All in all, a really good action pack movie! WATCH IT AND ENJOY - YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!

B002GY9F9K|5.0|[[ASIN:B002GY9F9K Legend of the Seeker: The Complete First Season]]    The Legend of The seeker season 1 gives one very many laughs and fun.  Fun to watch the development of the main lead characters.  Fun to watch the absolutely gorgeous landscape images of New Zealand.  Fun to just sit back and relax with this tv adapation of Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth fantasy books.  The series pilot music score by Joseph LoDuca, won the 2009 Emmy for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score).  One just has to be amazed by the tremendous effort made by actors, writers, creative and production teams alike, to give us these 22 episodes of season 1 in the short timespan they had to create them.      Bridget Regan, Craig Horner and Bruce Spence are a delight to watch and they handle their roles very well. This series, especially if one doesn't take it all too seriously, it's definately high on my list of favorite escapism things to watch.      The audio commentaries accompanying some of the episodes make it clear how much everyone was enjoying themselves during the intensive shooting period. I find that it plainly shows in the episodes. Even the darker ones.    There hasn't been a fantasy series like this on TV since the ending of xena. LoTS is from the same Xena prod.team but definately less campy, a bit more serious plus comedy wasn't forgotten in the process. LoTS has filled the gap for the fans worldwide who love this genre,  The second and sadly probably the final season has Tabrett Bethell (Cara) added to the main cast, much to the delight of many fans. I certainly can recommend picking up season 2 as soon as it's available and continue where season 1 left off.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|This sci-fi seems to be over rated at the box office.  It seemed to be interesting when you saw the previews.  I love sci-fi and this was a disappointment.  It did have action and the characters were interesting but could have been more exciting.  The story was poor and hard to keep up with.  It did have some good ideas but half way through the movie I was ready to turn it off.  I think mixing real people and animation figures was a mistake in this movie.

1933308087|3.0|I purchased the book and I was really happy with it. Enjoyed looking at it. But using the book as a refrence is frustrating.   My complaint is that the layout with the grids make the book difficult to use.  When I want to make a quilt I do not decide to make a 6-grid quilt.  I want to make a basket quilt and look at all the basket quilts. There are a few pages where all the quilts have been put together by quilt type - but they are not all inclusive and scattered through out the book.  The more I use the book the more disappointed with it I am. I can tell a lot of work went into this book and the grids are nice when it comes time to make the block pattern but would find the book much more useful if it were sorted differently.  Not everything needs a grid.  A small block repeating would be considered a 16 grid where I would consider it a 2 grid.
0545123275|3.0|When Grace was very young she was viciously attacked by a pack of wolves.  But instead of becoming terrified of them, Grace has been fascinated by the wolves in the forest near her home.  Every winter she watches one yellow eyed wolf in particular, not really understanding her attraction or connection to him.  All she knows is he returns each year and somehow it comforts her.<br /><br />Sam is an 18 year old boy who has a secret.  In the warm summer months he is an average teenager, but when the cold harsh winter temperatures hit, he makes a miraculous transformation into a wolf.  He lives among a pack of wolves who, like him, also change.  It is crucial to their survival that their secret is kept from normal humans but since he stopped the attack on Grace when she was a child, he has been waiting for her.  He watches her from afar, both in wolf and human form, falling in love with her more as each year passes.<br /><br />Shiver is told from two alternating points of view.  I'm not always a fan of this style usually finding it distracting, however I did enjoy reading from both Grace and Sam's point of view.  The insight from both characters greatly enhanced the story for me.<br /><br />With all the buzz about this book I was very excited to finally have a chance to read Shiver.  I had high expectations going in and I think that might have contributed to my disappointment with the first half of the book.  This story is a very slow build and I don't usually have much patience for that but I stuck with it mostly because I was curious about why so many of my fellow readers were so excited about this book.  It wasn't until about 170 pages in until this story really grabbed my attention and made me want to really dig in.  I am very glad continued to read though, after about halfway through I did not want to put this book down.<br /><br />One of the interesting things about this story is the slightly different take on werewolves.  Instead of the werewolves' form being based on the cycle of the moon, the wolves are instead forced to change during the very cold temperatures of winter.  Since some of the wolves seem to resent the change I spent a great deal of time wondering why they didn't just move to Arizona where the temperatures are warmer.  The reason why was explained, but not until late into the story.<br /><br />Grace and Sam's romantic relationship develops slowly. You don't get the typical overly possessive male werewolf who is obsessed with dominating and claiming his mate. Sam is said to the be the best of the pack, and presumably in line as the future alpha however as a human he is none of the things you'd expect from an alpha male in paranormal romance.  Sam and Grace experience a romance years in the making and even when they meet face to face they still take things slowly making for a very sweet romantic build.  Even in very close quarters Sam is a gentleman and the relationship progresses appropriately with a refreshing innocence for this age group.  Although Grace is only 17 and lives with her parents, she manages to stow a boy away in her room night after night without her parents knowledge. I found this far fetched and I was disappointed that Grace's parents were portrayed as oblivious morons who have no idea their daughter has a boy practically living in their home without their knowledge.<br /><br />The cast of supporting characters are quite entertaining, particularly Isabel and Jack.  Jack is a school mate of Grace who was attacked by wolves and presumed dead.  Isabel is his sarcastic sister who wants to get to the bottom of his disappearance.  The two of them provide some great comic relief as well as add an interesting twist to the story.<br /><br />Obviously I can't give away the ending but I will say I was not expecting it to end the way it did and Grace and Sam's story stayed with me for some time after I closed the book.  Overall I enjoyed Shiver with it's slightly different take on werewolves and refreshing, innocent romance.  I am looking forward to reading the next book, Linger.eading the next book, Linger.
044024238X|4.0|Light predictable reading.  Good for summer deck or beach read.  I like happy endings!
0385532458|2.0|Several of these stories are excellent. Gresham most always writes well, with plausible storylines and well drawn, interesting characters. A couple of these short stories are among the best things he has written.    On the whole, however, he gets an \\"incomplete\\" for this work. A short story should have a beginning, middle and end. Several of these seem to be missing their last few pages. Without a conclusion it is just a sketch, not a story.
0767827902|5.0|Best Actor Award went to \\"Ben Johnson\\" a long over due for this actor.  A perfect drama part for Ben to play.    We were sorry to hear we lost him after his part in this movie.   His acting made you feel like what he said was real life.   It was a coming out story for the rest of the cast in a small Texas town,   sex, fun, love,  and movies centered around the lives of the towns folk,   worth watching more than once..... Gary Crawford
B00275EGWY|5.0|This movie is excellent.  I am not a war movie lover, but this was different and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B001F0TM5I|5.0|MOVIE:<br />\\"Death Proof\\" - part two of the Rodriguez/Tarantino \\"Grindhouse\\" feature - is, simply put, a darn good time. The movie pays homage to both horror films and car flicks from the 60s & 70s, and it does so quite well. If you were a fan of \\"Vanishing Point\\", \\"Bullet\\", \\"Dirty Mary Crazy Larry\\", etc. then you'll love Tarantino's take on mean cars being driven at high speeds. The movie may start off a bit slow for some of today's audience, but if you're more of a fan of getting to know and love the characters then you likely won't even notice. After about the 20 minute mark you'll be sucked in and by the last 30 minutes you'll pretty much only be sitting on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />BLU RAY:<br />The \\"Death Proof\\" master was purposefully scratched and beat up, which does an excellent job of imparting the feeling that you're really watching an old car movie. You can tell the video quality wants to shine through, however, and I think the Blu Ray version is definitely worth picking up over the DVD. Even though the film is scratched, you never see any aliasing or video artifacts that would suggest a sub-par transfer. The movie looks exactly as it should. Now, \\"Part 2\\" of the movie (no further detail given to avoid spoilers) is where the Blu Ray quality really gets a chance to shine. The scratches go away and the film is presented in greyscale as the setting is transitioned. Then, almost abruptly, the film switches to full, gorgeous (blemish-free) color. The contrast to the panchromatic footage is astounding. Rich colors fill the screen and stay for the remainder of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, a great film for anyone looking for a tense-but-not-too-serious Saturday night special. Definitely recommended.

142314189X|1.0|I don't think I have ever read such a predictable, incomprehensible, inaccurate, and overly stupid book series in my life! (I never read Twilight, but I can't stand that either.) Percy Jackson and the Olympians is the dumbed down American Version of Harry Potter. A shameless ripoff of a much more talented piece of work. Worse yet is when it tries to deliver something original, Riordan fails at giving solid evidence. WARNING: The following rant is rage filled. The Greek Gods did NOT create the Earth, they merely manipulated it. So saying that the world would fall apart if Olympus was destroyed is bull crap. I don't remember Heracles, Aeneas, Romulus or Remus ever being dyslexic or suffering from ADHD. Speaking of which, warriors do not have ADHD, they are focused more than anything. Demigods were not all warriors, and if the Greek gods were also the Roman gods and somehow the American gods than the whole thing about them be dyslexic and reading Greek better makes no sense whatsoever. And weren't Warrior demigods only the children of Mars/Ares? Romulus and Remus were merely diplomats, not warriors. Now then, if I remember from my Latin class (where we actually read Latin we don't just talk about mythology) the Greek Pantheon were arrogant, that's why they lived on a mountain. Why in the name of all that is logical are they hiding from the real world? They always wanted followers, they were more powerful than humans, why hide!? Oh wait, the wizards in Harry Potter, only makes sense to rip it off right Rick? The characters are either unlikeable, stupid, underdeveloped, or stereotypical, and overall, I couldn't believe how much I missed Harry Potter, His Dark Materials, Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of Narnia. But now I come to my biggest complaint, Rick Riordan can't take any of this seriously!!! Every Chapter title was a literal joke, and at nearly every turn was another bad joke that I wouldn't tell. In the conclusion, stay away from this book series!!!!!!!!!Instead, read one of the book serials I mentioned or A Series of Unfortunate Events. All of which are thought-provoking and aren't shallower than a kiddie pool.

0140189378|5.0|One of Bellow's more famous works, Seize the Day is a novella depicting the very tumultuous goings-on in a day of \\"Tommy\\" Wilhelm Adler's life.  Tommy is the quintessential has-been (or possibly never-was).  He is an actor who never made it.  In his middle-age, he still depends on his father as an adolescent does--even throwing tantrums when his father does not see things his way.  Tommy is estranged from his wife, has no job or hope of finding work, and lacks the wherewithal to function as an adult in society.  He is easily swept up by confidence men such as Dr. Tamkin, an unctuous snake who swindles him in the commodities trade.<br />The pages fly by all too quickly here.  Tommy, at the end, comes to terms with his lot, but still the reader is left with the idea that nothing will change.  Essentially, Tommy becomes a neurotic allegory for the child in all of us who never wants to grow up, who wants to be taken care of, who refuses to accept life as it truly is and instead dwells in a mental utopia.  When the time comes, I shall definitely be seeking more of Bellow's works.
B00005ONMO|5.0|this sets' sonics and soundstage are superb.  At these prices they are certainly worth having and the Philharmonia's playing is excellent along with its Maestro.   I wasn't enamored with the Das Klagende aat all.
0307463745|3.0|This was a quick read of a sententious guide to the business word from the guys over at 37signals.  There were many common sense lessons imparted, but there were some counterintuitive ones as well.  For a small-business owner or an entrepreneur, this book is worth the read.  Anyone still stuck in an Eighties or Nineties mindset of how things ought to be done needs this book to see how things are done now.<br />Much true to their form, Messrs. Fried and Heinemeier Hansson do not candy-coat or add filler.  Unfortunately, this sometimes leaves some of the book feeling a bit sparse.  Details or extra experiences might have gone a long way to help drive home a point in certain spots.  All in all, this is a good and fast read--but probably was not life-changing.
1559408898|4.0|In 1987 Paul Verhoven's Robocop was burning up the box office as a fun sci-fi action movie. When I first saw the film I didn't really think much more of it than a fun couple of hours in the theatre. Twenty-three years and much reflection later I now view the film as a darkly funny satire of the Reagan years and media commercialism. The film resonates with comic moments that I just didn't notice the first time around.    Peter Weller stars as Alex Murphy a Detroit police officer who is brutally attacked by a group of drug dealers and left for dead only to be resurrected as Robocop the city's newest crime fighting cyborg. The film with its frequent media breaks and commercials gives a view of a stratified urban social landscape. The poor city dwellers who are plauged by frequent crime versus the ivory tower corporation who is essentially wanting to run the Police Force as a private corporation. While the structure of the film pits the corporation against the community interest the film offers much more.    Upon reflection this film is the genesis of many of the action films that came later (Predator, Terminator, Transformers). The special effects  were incredible for 1987 and the stop motion animation by Phil Tippett pays tribute to the great animators who came before. Rob Bottin's special makeup and effects have become iconographic.    The version that I viewed was the out of print Criterion Director's cut edition  which adds in Verhoeven's excessively violent content that had to be cut for the MPAA censors. Today, other than the vioence the film is quite tame by most standards. The question that is often asked is whether the casual viewer should seek out the expensive Criterion edition or just pick up a readily available lower priced version. The Criterion Edition includes a very well done commentary by Verhoeven, producers Jon Davison and Edward Neumeier. This commentary is well produced and will add a great deal to the overall enjoyment of the film. There is an excellent though primarily textual shooting history of the film by Robocop historian Paul M. Sammon presented in visual essay form, both the teaser and theatrical trailers and some story board comparisons. If there is a flaw with the Criterion its that the print doesn't always seem as sharp as it should for such a modern film though this may have been a fault in the original Orion source print. It should also be noted that the film is presented in the director's perferred aspect ratio of 1:66 rather thatn the films usual 1:85:1 as seen on some of the mass produced editions leading to some rather severe window boxing.    All in all a good if not necessarily low budget version for completists of the Criterion collection. Most viewers will do just fine with one of the cheaper versions.
1416511946|5.0|I've read many of the negative reviews posted here and all I can say is, do not let the nay-sayers deter you from reading this amazing, thoughtful, honest, accurate depiction of what life with addiction really is. For a celebrity to reveal these extremely personal and intimate accounts of the darkest days of his life is so much more than most celebs do and I believe Nikki published this to reach out to anyone living in the world of addiction with a friendly and supportive hand. He did not publish this for money, acclaim or any of the other reasons that have been suggested. He is a person who has been to hell and back and thank you, Nikki, for counting us worthy to get a glimpse into your heart and soul, despite the unflattering, unglamorous, and very unpleasant and flawed picture it paints of your persona.     Contrary to what other reviewers have said, Nikki is in no way bragging or taking secret pleasure in presenting himself as a wild, out of control, non-conformist but instead presents himself as a lost person with little confidence, little self-esteem and little to live for despite all his fame and fortune. The diary accounts this with entries like \\"I have no friends left\\" and \\"I didn't talk to a single person today\\" on a Christmas that he spends all alone doing drugs and eating Christmas dinner at McDonalds alone. This is not the \\"I'm on top of the world\\" rock-star image we might expect. This is a lost, lonely man who has nothing and no one positive in his life. This is also a story of a person suffering from clinical depression who self-medicates to ease mental pain and uses sex with hoards of women to help distract from the symptoms of the illness. It is a sad, sad account of a person who seems to have it all, yet in reality, has nothing, knows it, and tries to compensate for the loss with drugs and other excesses. I think we can all relate to that in some form or another. I hope that in the twenty years since the diary was written that Nikki has found the love and support that he deserves and recognizes how much he has accomplished in his life despite his illness. Nikki will always be a hero of mine for his honesty and committment to using his own demons to help others conquer theirs. Thank you, Nikki.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|In 1970 James Taylor and Carol King first played the Troubadour in West Hollywood. Thirty-six years later, in November 2007, James Taylor, Carole King and members of their renowned original band \\"The Section\\" (featuring guitarist Danny Kortchmar, bassist Leland Sklar and drummer Russell Kunkel) returned to the Troubadour for a three-night, six-show run to celebrate the venue's 50th anniversary. This CD/DVD captures the show in a 75 minute celebration of some of their greatest songs.    While not a high energy evening by any means the show does exatly what it should do. It showcases muscians doing what they do best playing music. Taylor on guitar and King on piano trading songs and comments from their long friendship. The set features Carole King's \\"So Far Away,\\" \\"It's Too Late,\\" and \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\\" as well as James Taylor's \\"Carolina in My Mind,\\" \\"Sweet Baby James,\\" and \\"Fire and Rain,\\" to name just a few.    Taylor has released several DVD'sin recent years this is definately a pleasant edition to add to your collection. As a note this would have been a five star review but the soundstage of the concert through a home theatre system seems a little limited at times.

B002ZG97RE|5.0|The year 2010 could be the begining for Action Movies to be discarded in Hollywood. First we had the amazing EDGE OF DARKNESS with MEL GIBSON that did OK in the box office but this one took the whole bakery as it did very poorly.<br /><br />The budget for this movie was $100 million and did at the box office around $37 million so \\"Houston we have a SERIOUS problem\\".<br /><br />In Hollywood everything goes in cycles. Now we have 3D movies coming back like the latest thing when in fact they've been around since the 70s and 80s. Im making this comment because AVATAR banked $600 million dollars.<br /><br />Focusing on the positive - This is an amazing action movie by Matt Damon and the director of the last 2 Bourne Identity movies. It is non stop action from begining to end. Its about the war in IRAQ and it reminds me a bit of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN because is very intense.<br /><br />Again, I have no idea why it did so bad at the box office when in fact the movie is very very good.<br /><br />To anyone that reads this, we need to support the ACTION MOVIE genre or it will be extint for a while because the bottom line in Hollywood is CASH!!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Nice kindle edition of both Little Women and its sequel Good Wives.<br />Both are beautiful stories and here they are complete and unabridged, asthey should be.<br /><br />This edition would benefit from a little more formatting but on the whole it is very good, especially with both books for free.<br /><br />Wonderful to have these in my e-library to read again, and share with my daughter.

6304698798|5.0|Let's see. The good guys wear white hats. Right? The bad guys wear black. Well, it used to be that way. But here with \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\\" separating the two becomes almost impossible since there's three and they all have temporary fleeting alliances in the greedy search for gold coinage at about the time of the civil war. Anything goes. It makes for an interesting story and fascinating character study, if you like your stories punctuated with a lot of assorted violence and gunfire. So be it. Director Sergio Leone does a masterful job of telling said tail in a stark dreary, wild-west environment. As with most Clint Eastwood movies, everyone gets beat to a pulp but manages to come back to deliver revenge and put bullet holes through an astonishing number of people. It's action packed and rather fun to watch. Rated R for violence, and it earned it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B002VPE1PW|5.0|I purchased this to house my iPad for business and personal travel.  I wasn't sure if it would be an exact fit but I rolled the dice given the measurements in the description (and the low price).  I'm very happy that I did because it's perfect for my iPad and exactly what I was looking for.    It shipped quick and painlessly in the Amazon Frustration Free box.  The only Amazon branding on the item can be found on the zipper pulls, which is fine by me.  And the inside is a bright orange which adds a little flavor to an otherwise boring but highly practical neoprene sleeve.
B003KUSUG8|1.0|I always felt Encore was Eminem's worst album. But since this album, things has changed. The whole album is horrible. I mis the dr Dre beats and the whole hardcore vibe that he used to have. What surprises me the most is that a lot of people give this album a five star ranking. Since when have you been listening to Eminem? Because I've been listening to his music since the Slim Shady LP. That stuff was real. Compared with the old days I can't even call this album a rap album. The fact that he's working with Pink and Rihanna tells the whole story. This is pop music. I guess people who love this album don't feel the same way about rap music as I do. I really tried to listen to the album but I just don't feel it. I skipped most of the songs half-way through. Most of the beats aren't even close to hip-hop and when I heard the name \\"Mariah\\" in the first song I thought to myself: \\"You can't be kidding.\\" And please, what is it with his sentimental vibe. The album is tasteless, useless, horrible. I mis the old Em. Maybe I'm getting old.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I'm a 58 year old - was totally blown away by their music in the 70's - Carole King - James Taylor - in particular - Joni Mitchell - Carly Simon - Neil Young - Cat Stevens to name a few.    If you are forever locked in this mode as I am - you absolutely need to purchase this cd/dvd combo.  Just do it.  I have listened to the DVD a hundred times.  I never tire of it.  These great artists have put it all together to take us back to that magical time in our history.  Do them the honor of sharing it with them.  Imagine getting Carole out of retirement to do this!  The band is fantastic - originals.  Imagine getting these guys together.  All of them legendary.  And more importantly - they stuck with us all these years - gave their hearts and souls to us.  Their songs became our personal anthems and they understand that.  Every one of us has special meaning attached to so many of their songs - and as I say - they understand that.  I digress.      This is a must have CD/DVD - trust me.

B00009P1O5|2.0|After the nondescript Hawks and Doves I was hoping for Reactor to be a return to form for one of my favourite eclectic performers. Another reunion with of Crazy Horse certainly augured well. Alas, from the opening bars of the first song on side one I knew that I was in for a disappointment. I am not anal about lyrics. I can listen to, and sing along with, some pretty banal rhyming couplets without being turned off the music. But really? After producing some of the greatest music of the 1970's Neil Young sounds on Reactor as if he is barely going through the motions. T-bone is a case in point. It rocks. However, listening to this talented troubadour repeat \\"Got mashed potato\\" a few dozen times is embarrassing. On song after song the lyrics are, and I really hate to say this, lame. Only the album's first song and its last, Shots, are worthy. Reactor sounds to me like the work of an artist who doesn't care, is taking his audience for granted and just couldn't be bothered. Either that or he was taking the mickey. I'm with Allmusic on this one - if he was so consumed with looking after his son that he couldn't devote enough time and attention to his music then he would have served himself and his fans better had he taken a sabbatical.<br /><br />In the 1970's Neil Young made one excellent record after another. His 1980's got off to a rocky start with Hawks and Doves. Reactor, unfortunately, did not represent a positive move forward. Things would get worse before they got better. Even musical superstars are permitted the occasional slump. The good news is that he'd be back with a bang a few years later.
B00362DRNG|5.0|This CD makes a great gift for Duran Duran fans. It's loaded with cool remixes - some that would be hard to find or that were previously unavailable etc.  It's nicely packaged in a little box with the original album artwork front and back and includes 2 CDs (the orig. studio version and all the alt./remixes) and a DVD with various versions (cut/uncut) of videos from the album and more.

B0001GMIOE|5.0|LOVE this battery--my first battery for my Canon Powershot G3 lasted SEVEN years (I got the camera in 2004, and this is my first time replacing the battery). I've become completed spoiled with the awesome battery life and refuse to buy any camera that doesn't have a rechargeable lithium ion battery). I've even used this camera DAILY on a 10 day trip to England, taking and reviewing pictures, without recharging even once (I hadn't brought the correct adapter). This is a fantastic price for an awesome product--it charges up reasonably quickly, has fantastic, long life, and fits perfectly in my Canon Powershot G3. :)
B003KT3NRA|1.0|Just saw Vince Neil live at the M3 concert near Baltimore.  He cannot sing worth a darn anymore. He is totally done. He had to have his guitarist sing songs for him, and they blew him away. That being said, this CD is way produced to cover up just how bad he is now.  He's a Whore done live was awful...I was embarrassed for him.  Poor Vince, lived the fast life and is now just too slow to rock.

193413712X|3.0|Unlike some of the other reviewers, I've been disappointed with a number of the recent Pulitzer winners, but I did like \\"Gilead,\\" and given Marylin Robinson's enthusiasm for \\"Tinkers,\\" I decided to give it a try. The opening scene was indeed brilliant, and I had high hopes, but unfortunately that level of brilliance wasn't sustained. At times I was reminded of some of Faulkner's denser passages in \\"Absolom, Absolom\\" and \\"The Sound and the Fury,\\" but the story never came together for me the way Faulkner's did--probably because I never got into any of the characters enough to really care what happened to them. Maybe next time...

Understanding each other COULD prevent years of needless and unintended hurt feelings and emotional and physical separation, if the people you are dealing with are at all reasonable and sane. We all experience love differently and view the method in which we show it differently. We THINK we are doing it right, BUT, if the other person is clueless and totally non-receptive, it's as good as NO EXPRESSION AT ALL.
B002VPE1XY|4.0|Ideal for carrying your digital camera on your belt or attached to back pack, shoulder bag, or purse straps. I've actually been using it for my cell phone when I don't want to carry my digital camera. This case is black and looks good with almost anything. The case's snap makes it easy to open and close the case without effort and in a hurry. It's a pretty simple, very functional design.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|I agree with the other reviews that this soundtrack is very, very good.  If you like instrumental soundtracks, I think you will be moved by this.  I am a fan of the Braveheart, Gladiator, etc, and this is almost if not as good.
B000056MOQ|4.0|I was expecting more than one number by Miss Battle.  But I must admit that her only appearance was worth the DVD.<br />As far as Karajan... and the Viena Opera Ballet and the Spanish Horses.... second to none.  What a show!
B003ELOQD4|1.0|I gave up watching this after a pretty short while.  I left it play in the background though and enjoyed the concert (the sound that is)!  I later skipped throughout the whole video to confirm what I already knew.  The filming is horrible!  The camera jumps from one thing to another constantly every 3 seconds.  You cannot watch a friggin thing the entire show.  It's like closing your eyes and opening them every 5 seconds while being spin around.  It flashes from Bono, to the audience, to The Edge, the drummer, flashes of video that change so often and last so little, you get dizzy!  Sadly this seems to be a trend because ANOTHER video of a band I like Spandau Ballet reunion tour 2009 was filmed almost the same exact way.  I backed off on going to concerts in the 90's when ticket prices started to shoot up close to $100.  The Eagles seemed to start that trend.  I seen almost 100 shows however from 1985 to 1995 when prices were cheap and all levels of tickets were released to the public.  It was a GREAT time to see all the bands I ever loved, multiple times in many cases.  There wasnt much need to watch videos and DVDs.  But since than I have caught on DVD the groups I wanted to catch a tour of, but didnt want to spend $100-$200 for a ticket.  Now they are starting to ruin that with this stupid kind of filming.  Another problem with live shows that may not bother some people is that they crank up the volume to match Deep Purples old record in the 70's.  But when they film a DVD or live show, they cant do that because the recording would be distorted!  So instead they are distorting the filming, shame on them!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Well I did not go to the movies to see this and was relutant to purchase it but, I really enjoy this movie. There is the usual good versus bad but the story line was very good and even without the 3D effects the secenery in the movie was outstanding.

B0038QGXHW|5.0|If you are a lover of the thousands of tunes that comprise the Great American Songbook  you will enjoy this project. It is a quiet thought-full performance by two great musicians who once again exhibit  the skill and knowledge acquired from a life time of music making.In this era of loud, in your face performances it is a pleasure to listen to two masters who continue to quietly pursue the path of excellence.....indeed, less is more..........a warm bath for the ears, this disc is a wise purchase.

B003JSU2NU|5.0|What's great about the Twilight Series soundtracks?  Each one, like the movies, has its own unique mood and feel.  The Eclipse soundtrack is a little darker and edgier than the first two, and I'm lovin' it!  It's been going non-stop in my CD player, and I've already ordered one of the artists' CDs (Florence + the Machine).  The soundtracks have opened my ears to a wonderful world of lesser known, talented artists.
B0026OE2O8|1.0|This product has serious production issues since they sent me a disk marked as bluray on the disk itself and the case but it turned out it is really a dvd. Really dissapointing.
044024238X|3.0|I really like Sophie Kinsella and my mom told me I had to read this book. Sadly this one was a bit of a miss for me. I had a hard time trying to get into it, and a lot of the things that happen to the main character are really stressful. I found myself in constant worry for how she would handle these situations all throughout the novel. There are a few funny and lighthearted parts, but overall I could only say I thought this book was OK. Certainly not my favorite of hers.
1439153663|5.0|This book was so hard to put down! I was sucked in by the first chapter! I love a story with a good scandal and this one had it! The switching narrative between two characters was very easy to follow, unlike most novels that use that style.  The plantation setting was somewhat new to me and I found it very interesting, even though it could very difficult to read about the abuse and injustices that the characters had to face.  All in all, I truly enjoyed the book. I read it in a little over one day and my house definitely suffered from neglect, but it was worth it. This is one of those books that will stick with me for a long time after I closed the final chapter.
0385342039|4.0|At first I didn't think I was going to like this book. I didn't get into it until after the first couple of chapters. Once I did I really liked it. This is such a charming story and you can't help but fall in love with Sadie. It makes you want to put on a flapper dress and do the Charleston. I say pour a nice glass of wine, turn on some swing, and devour this book!
0762759437|5.0|Mostly, when you read guidebooks these days, the reviews are so general, you're never even sure if the writer ate there.  Eisenberg's writing is so specific and detailed you know exactly which dish to order, and how to order it. (You also get hungry, so watch out). Not to mention, the book covers so many places that never show up in other general NYC or even Brooklyn guides. I live in Brooklyn and we're already using this book each weekend to eat out.
B000M4RG42|2.0|I was expecting a harrowing movie about war.  Kind of like what \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was for Normandy, only for the Battle of Iwo Jima.<br /><br />As deft as Eastwood is as a director, I feel this is largely a forgettable, medicore film.  A couple of these reasons are Eastwood's fault; a couple of them he couldn't have done anything about.<br /><br />1.  The characters all look the same!  Since you couldn't tell them apart, it was hard to get going with their stories.  Which one is Hank?  Which one is Harlon?  (I also had this complaint about the companion movie, but if say that there it would be dismissed as racism.)<br /><br />2.  Unlike Normandy, the Battle of Iwo Jima simply does not lend itself well to cinematic vigor, except for the shot of the fleet from atop Suribachi.<br /><br />3.  The story of the Indian had no insights.  Yeah, it's interesting that that was an Indian guy.  But I think Eastwood had no idea what to say about it and no idea what to do:  in end, you just end up getting another stereotypical drunk Indian story.<br /><br />4.  Regrettably, it seemed like Eastwood torpedoed the whole theme of sacrifice by getting into the boys back home having to stump around selling war bonds.  Sure, this was hucksterism, but is that really the direction the film should have took?  In the end, it was almost as if the movie wasn't about soldiers and sacrifice, but the literal truth of the flag's having been placed and re-placed.  This was an unfortunate decision.<br /><br />5.  Jumping back and forth around in time was not recommended:  it made everything much more confusing.
B003A4IFGY|1.0|The modern era includes so little rock n' roll that I know none that's being recorded, and extremely little that is performed live. News that Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers are to release an album leads me to believe that I will be given opportunity to hear one or two, maybe three, rock n' roll songs, as an average of about that many seem to make it on each of his albums these past twenty or so years. But with Mojo we find in sixteen tracks no trace of rock n' roll, except maybe for a tiny bit in \\"Candy,\\" because this song includes a sense of movement.<br /><br />The music here, technically speaking, can be considered \\"good\\" but who cares if what you like is rock n' roll, because this music hasn't a trace of roll (outside of that small amount on 'Candy') and the only rock is so bluesy that \\"rock\\" is not the first or second word that comes to mind to describe it.<br /><br />Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, your fans expect at least a portion of uptempo beats and fun, but you, particularly Petty himself, no longer seem capable of having any.<br /><br />I saw the band in concert last night and, trust me, the 20,000 or so people in attendance did not respond to the five - that's right, five - Mojo tracks performed in consecutive order, and the applause after each was forced. (Concert sidenote lament: I've seen Petty live four different times and not once have I heard such great tracks as \\"Zombie Zoo\\" \\"Apartment Song\\" \\"King's Highway\\" \\"Ways to be Wicked\\" \\"Anything that's Rock n' Roll\\" etc ...<br /><br />My biggest concern with this album is for the band members themselves. What they've gained financially they've lost in their sense of awareness; for if they had  a keen amount of awareness they would have looked outside of themselves and seen that, in these dark times, sixteen tracks of blues and without a track of rock n' roll is not what Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers fans want.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|A very unusual vampire movie, from Sweden.  I don't like vampire movies but was told I ought to watch this one at least.  I'm not sorry.<br /><br />My big beef was that while the movie was just fine, the audio/subtitle situation is awful.  The original film is in Swedish.  The disk says there are subtitles, but they don't actually appear, even when the characters are reading Swedish.  What's left is the awful dubbing, which is just comically bad and a constant distraction and spell-ruiner.  Heck, even if you can understand Swedish, you can't get the Swedish audio, which was deleted entirely on the U.S. release.<br /><br />DVD needs to be seriously redone.
B000063DHL|4.0|I've grown up listening to Iron Maiden so I pretty much love every song in this album. If I had to choose three good songs I would say, The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner, Heaven Can Wait, and Wasted Years were the top picks in my opinion in this album. I highly recommend you listen to every song. They have a little bit of a history lesson with Alexandre The Great to a great message on Wasted Years. Overall I give it 4 stars because its not their GREATEST work but its one of my favorites. Sound Quality is great.
B00005JPKE|2.0|I was intrigued to watch this, as seeing a movie about the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective seemed promising.<br /><br />Alas!  I don't feel the director or the scriptwriter had any insights into that battle, into the the lives of their characters, or into the mind of the Japanese that anybody else doesn't.  It was all so stereotypical.<br /><br />Plus:  couldn't tell the characters apart, as they all look the same and Eastwood does nothing about this.  The guy who was taken from his wife?  I thought he died like 3 times!  Was he the guy with the shovel at the end?  (Before branding me a racist, bear in mind I had the same complaint about the companion movie, \\"Flags of Our Fathers.\\")

0061547832|5.0|I've always been more than a little curious about Donald Trump. After reading this book I am a new fan.<br /><br />Get into the mind of a great. The authors teach by example using stories and they give you insight into their thought processes by telling you why they did what they did.<br /><br />This is My first book by either author and I cannot wait to read more. The thing that surprised Me most was that Donald Trump isn't the jerk people like to think he is. I came away with a new respect for this man. I think what I liked most is the way Mr. Trump was candid about details of his life that someone with less self confidence would have probably left out. It makes him very human.<br /><br />This book is easily one of the best books I have ever read and I will expand My library by adding some more of Mr. Trump's books to it.
B001BNFR6W|5.0|I absolutely love will & grace. I used to record every episode of the show. Now whenever I feel like a little will and grace I just pop in a dvd. Karen and Jack are absolutely marvelous.
1932907009|5.0|I was completely blown away by how insightful \\"Save the Cat\\" was. Snyder's overall theory of screenwriting is founding completely in logic but no one has ever articulated it so clearly. The book is filled with moments where I was slapping my own forehead saying \\"of course, why didn't I think of that.\\" He doesn't dance around the fact that he is a spec script writer and that his main goal is to write scripts that get purchased and appeal to large demographics and in his honesty about that he doesn't dance around telling you what you need to do to write a successful screenplay.     If you are open to it, he'll force you to sit down with your original screenplay idea and rewrite the entire thing and it'll be better because of it. A must have for any director, producer and writer that hopes to work in the industry and understand storytelling better.
0321344758|5.0|This book came highly recommended by a few different speakers at a conference I attended. I kept hearing people praising it for its simple examples and no BS format. Its a quick read, but there is a lot of information on User Experience, Site Navigation, and User Testing. Very good for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of how to make your website easy to use.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I enjoyed Avatar but I didn't think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. However this DVD, Blu-ray combo package is great. You can't ask for a whole lot more. I was able to have a copy on my computer, have a DVD that I can bring over to my less tech savvy friends and Blu-ray when I'm feeling the need to be immersed in the planet of Pandora once more.     If you are an Avatar fan this is the combo package to get.
0061353248|5.0|Behavioral Economics sounds really boring, but this book is a great read for understanding some of the underlying psychology behind how we make decisions. It gave me some really interesting views of what I could do as a designer and marketer. Very interesting and absolutely NOT BORING.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Recovery is a solid and mature album from Em. He rhymes with heart and conviction on most of the tracks. There are really only one or two songs that I skip on the album. I would definately recommend this album to any fan of Eminem or HipHop for that matter. I don't like long reviews so take my word for it and purchase this album, you won't be dissapointed.
1578988411|5.0|Based on multiple references to this book during published interviews with novelist Adriana Trigiani, I decided to purchase this book.<br /><br />Trigiani, when asked about how she worked her way past writer's block, or if she ever got writer's block, said she never had the problem because she used her subconscious mind as a tool in her work. She cited the guidance she received from the book as the method she used to solve problems, whether they involved the plot in a book or the resolution of other kinds of situations she was facing.<br /><br />After several months of reading interviews where this was mentioned, I finally did what I should have done in the first place, and ordered the book through Amazon.com. I have been delighted. It's a book that I am reading, pencil in hand, notes in process, and savoring line by line. I recommend it highly, and am so grateful to Trigiani for sharing this wonderful tool with her fans.
B00007LTIC|5.0|Welcome to High School 1977!  (yikes :)This album takes me back to the beginning of high school! I smile whenever I listen to this as it reminds me of good friends, field parties, freedom and beautiful music.  This is my absolute favorite Yes - album! This is a rare immaterial priceless gem of music in perfection that I hold close to my heart always!  I have the vinyl of this somewhere (I think) - the CD is great too - I listen to it in my car whenever I can find it (the CD that is)....
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book is slow taking off but worth sticking with.  The second book is a real \\"page turner\\", this book is more of an introduction to all the chacters.  I love Salander!  After reading the book, go see the movie, it was filmed in Sweeden and is only in English subtitle but very good as well.  I'm on the third book and it took a while to get into, much like the first book.  To bad that the author didn't get the series finished before he died.  I think his girlfriend should finish them!

B0006IEVFG|5.0|The watch came in good time. It was well packaged and in good condition. It was exactly what I expected.
B000000H66|2.0|The musicians are good here, and the music itself is pretty interesting. The vocals though, play a large hand in ruining anything this album had. Yes, yes, it's not just the fact that it's your typical death yips, but also that they sound really, really forced and repetitive -I don't know who can sit through more than the first few tracks. It's as if he lost his voice, but they went ahead anyway ...and, man, must have been burned out by then end of the whole ordeal. Not only this, but the lack of variation in the vocals seems to have somehow lured the rest of the music into the same dulling-down pattern..?                       As an instrumental album, this would have scored better...with a dynamic vocalist, this could have (dreamingly) been something pretty good. Because I've liked some of the ideas of Chuck Schuldiner, I'll give this more than one star.
B003L1ZXCU|4.0|I read a lot of thrillers, and it's rare when I find a thriller as smartly written as DAEMON.  This novel, which is about a computer program that slowly takes over the world, is clever, well written and filled with creative ideas.<br /><br />DAEMON reminds me a great deal of the work of the late Michael Crichton.  Like Crichton, author Daniel Suarez enjoys discussing the impact of scientific progress on society.  There are many eye-opening scenes in this novel where Suarez brilliantly illustrates how much of our lives -- and the global economy -- are now dependent on computer technology.  This material is what makes this novel exceptional, although Suarez's painstaking attention to detail sometimes distracts from the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, just like Crichton, Suarez falters a bit at characterization.  DAEMON is a novel with a large cast of characters, but many of them are at best two-dimensional.  Suarez does not seem interested in building his story around a central hero -- instead he constantly shifts perspectives, and relies heavily on a large cast of supporting characters who only appear in the narrative sporadically.  This relatively impersonal approach made it difficult for me to relate to the book at an emotional level.<br /><br />DAEMON also features a rather over-the-top plot that becomes less believable as the story progresses.  What begins as a murder mystery eventually evolves into a fight against world domination.  While I give Suarez credit for crafting an unconventional storyline, I found myself rolling my eyes at certain plot developments.  This isn't a fatal problem, however, because Suarez keeps the plot moving and offers so much interesting material.  Readers who dislike graphic violence and sex, however, should look elsewhere -- there's quite a bit of both in this novel.<br /><br />One last warning -- DAEMON is not a complete novel and therefore does not offer a true ending.  If you want to see how the story resolves, you'll have to read the recently published sequel, which I hope to read later this year.<br /><br />Overall, however, this book is a well-crafted effort, and worth your time.d sequel, which I hope to read later this year.       Overall, however, this book is a well-crafted effort, and worth your time.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|I did enjoy the final episode, I'll say that, up until the last 20 minutes where they basically said, \\"your last year of investing was completely meaningless.\\" It's completely frustrating to me, someone who doesn't believe in an afterlife, to have invested so much into this series to have the writer's beliefs shoved in my face. Sure, they shot the ending in a church with all the different religious symbols on the stained glass wall, but I'm not religious. I wanted to know about the science of the island and they basically said, \\"this island is too mysterious to understand.\\" No! That's bad writing! In the end of season 5 they alluded to the bomb blowing up the EMP well in the island as a connection to the flash-sideways events, but in the end we find out that the flash-sideways events have nothing to do with the bomb, making them completely meaningless. I loved the final episode, with the battle for good and evil, it was awesome... but I'm just embarrassed that the writers spent most of the final season on showing off their thoughts of an afterlife. It's just plain stupid. If I wanted to see religious propaganda I'd watch 'Touched by an Angel'. They masked this series as a cool, scientific, edgy, mystery and what I got was a miserable, emotional ending with no closure.<br /><br />It's like that old cliche: the character wakes up and it was all a dream. This was worse than that.
0061537969|5.0|I'm a dog lover. My dogs are my life, so I search out books (novels) about dogs. My sister recommend this book to me and I am so glad that she did. Yes, it has its sad parts, but most of the novel (told from the dogs point of view) is very funny. A must read.
B003K025V4|5.0|I think this CD is AMAZING! If you listen closely to the lyrics, especially since Miley co-wrote a majority of the songs, they simply talk about a girl growing up and maturing into a young woman, dealing with issues any 18-year-old would be experiencing.   I've been a fan of \\"I Can't Be Tamed\\" and yeah, it does kinda sound like Britney--but it's still got the Miley Cyrus flair. The entire CD is definitely different from anything Miley's done with a more techno/electric kind of sound and I think it sounds fantastic!   My favorite song is \\"Stay\\"--it's a wonderful ballad that really shows of Miley's voice. The piano in the background is the perfect touch. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this CD!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|this has gotten to be the best cd Eminem has produced. every song is worth listening to over and over.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|I think this CD is fantastic! Miley is growing up and these songs reflect the stage in life she is currently experiencing. And I love the mixing a lot of these songs have like \\"Liberty Walk\\" -- there's definitely a techno/electro/dance feel to a lot of the songs.   I LOVE \\"Can't Be Tamed.\\" Even though everyone says she wants to be like Britney...I love Britney! Miley does a good job of making it her own song and expressing herself as a young woman.   I also like some more of the slow beat songs like \\"Stay,\\" \\"Take Me Along,\\" and \\"My Heart Beats For Love.\\" If you listen to the lyrics closely, a majority being co-written by Miley, they simply express Miley as an 18-year-old woman dealing with relevant issues, like love.    I think it's a great CD!
0312979479|5.0|10 people meet for the first time at a house on a island. They were all invited by the owner of the house. As they get to know each other, they begin to wonder where the owner is and strange circumstances follow. First they find a morbid poem about ten Indians who die one by one in specific ways, and then people start dying under the same circumstances as the Indians in the poem.<br /><br />I was a little afraid when I started reading this book that I would have to remember every detail of the characters being presented, but that wasn't necessary. It was a quick read and fast paced, and I never guessed who the killer was in the end. It was also complicated, but not so much that I didn't understand what was going on. I had never read anything by Agatha Christie, and this was a good one to start with.
0670034711|5.0|Here is someone who is not wasting her time sitting on her \\"pity potty\\". She chose to change and experience her life. This is a poignant, gratifying and thought-provoking one woman journey, seeking out \\"her self\\". We all look for an escape route every now and then, fantasize about changing our lives, dream about it, think about it, and even plan it out, but....ultimately, there we sit! This is a valuable, insightful, exciting read. What really matters in YOUR life? Connection, love, compassion, reality, passion, goals, well-being...    Another GEM of a book I recently read that affected me like this one did, (and I plan to read soon again), is EXPLOSION IN PARIS...very similar premise that makes you explode with feelings of worth, resilience and passion, only it's a fight for survival, not just emotionally but for her life, literally. There's no shallowness here, only much to be admired and emulated.
B002AOWXQ8|4.0|This album offers a \\"Dawning of Aquarius\\" type utopianism that will certainly lighten  the mood for anyone who wants an little escape from the modern world of materialism.  However there is magical romance and tenderness captured in the single  \\"Home\\" that doesn't reoccur with the same potency on any of the album's accompanied tracks. I found myself a little disappointed by this. A majority of the tracks only feature the vocals of lead singer Alex Ebert who  offers much charisma but with out the vocal presence Jade Castrinos ( female voice in Home )  there  is something missing. I would parallel the chemistry between Alex and Jade to Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazelwood, yen and yang. I'm hoping the band's future albums will capitalize on this even more.    There is a lot buzz around this band and don't expect this album to live up to it but  Up From Below is worth checking out.    Jon Cowart   \\"Opinions Are Like Bellybuttons\\"
B001IF252M|5.0|LCD projectors seem to always be equipped with VGA connectors, so this adapter is crucial for anyone who has to give presentations using a recent Apple laptop with a mini DisplayPort connector.

It's a shame Apple stopped including these with their pro laptops a few years back, the adapter is a bit pricey when sold separately.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|...and after listening to her latest recording, \\"Memphis Blues,\\" that's a good thing!<br /><br />I've always admired Cyndi Lauper and her craft, and have always been confused as to why her popularity has had its ups and downs. While fabricated people like Madonna and her ilk were making it big, Cyndi, who was (and is) the better singer, was struggling to get heard.<br /><br />Of course Sony did her absolutely no favors by its lack of support for \\"Hatful Of Stars\\", one of her best efforts. That lack of support led to an even more \\"shove to the back of the room\\" mentality from music honchos.<br /><br />But as fans know, Cyndi Lauper is a trooper. And when finally given the chance, she blasted back with \\"At Last.\\" After dabbling in acoustic versions of her old material and putting out a pure dance CD, Cyndi returns with a full fledged blues recording. Its a remarkable and passionate work. Cyndi has the pipes and the instinct to create a true 'blues\\" delight. This is not blues \\"lite.\\"<br /><br />It speaks volumes that such well known blues artists as Musselwhite, Toussaint and B.B. King are involved in this recording. Jonny Lang's contributions also shows a belief in Cyndi's ability to deliver. But perhaps Cyndi's biggest compliment comes from the presence of the great Ann Peebles, who records very infrequently these days. Their take on \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" is Memphis blues at its best. (Will somebody please get Ann Peebles back in the studio! We've seen comebacks for Bettye Lavette and Candi Staton, its Ann's turn now!)<br /><br />If you're a true blues fan, don't be worried about this being a Cyndi Lauper recording. Believe me, she \\"gets it\\" and she delivers \\"it\\". So far, absolutely one of the best things I've heard in 2010!!
B000A6T262|4.0|This is the ultimate Star Trek movie DVD set. Its 20 discs contain all ten films in the original (pre-reboot) Star Trek timeline, as well as one disc of special features for each film. Obviously, not all movies in this set are masterpieces. Some fans will say that Star Trek: The Motion Picture is too long and drawn out, Star Trek V was bad all around, and that Insurrection seems more like a long TV episode than a movie. These criticisms are more or less accurate. However, no Star Trek collection can be complete with only a couple of the movies. This particular set may be showing its age a little bit now that many of the films have been re-released on Blu-Ray, but it's still quite a collection nonetheless.
0061922315|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It is about a woman in India who puts her child into a children's home and a woman in America who adopts the child.  This was a book that I could not put down that looks into the hearts of two very different women from very different cultures.  Definitely a five star book.
B001LF347E|5.0|There are a lot of TV Series out there.  But this is the best on in years.  It's actors are excellent, the story lines are done well, I often find myself cringing because I really have no way of figuring out how they are going to resolve it.  I'm impressed with the good themes behind the series, the magic and the creativity.  It's also managing to be convincingly medieval, has plenty of action, love, death, fighting, etc... and they haven't yet ruined it with becoming immoral.  It's well-balanced and I watch every episode.  It's the only TV show I DVR if I can't be there.  Merlin is in a league all its own.
630522577X|4.0|The Dvd arrived in good condition, the dvd case did not have any plastic wrapping (was in used condition however) but the actual Dvd was in very good condition. The shipping was very slow, longer than was stated in discription. Overall a very good experience.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|\\"First Blood\\" is the first in the Rambo series.  Sylvester Stallone could not have been better in his role as a soldier in a war attempting to reenter American society.  He is driven to the extreme by a misguided sheriff in a small town and eventually defends himself against a number of law enforcement officials and the National Guard.  In the flames of a burning town, Rambo defines what war can do to a person.

B002B3D2TU|5.0|I stumbled upon David Garrett's music by accident.  Not being a fan of violin in general (more of a piano/sax lover outside of my rock/metal world), I put this into my Wishlist here at Amazon, to think about it.  Every time I listened to the clips, I wanted to buy it, but always paused.  Then one day in my car, the yearning for something different (than my usual rock/metal etc) led me back to this CD.  It is a great CD.  His mastery of his instrument, along with his love for contemporary music and youthful take on classics are very uplifting.  LOVE this CD, and again, I'm not a huge fan of the violin.  He's great.  I've told everyone I know:  check out this music!!!
B0039SFKSW|5.0|Just when you think they don't make music like this anymore. Thank you Asia for listening to your heart, producing great music and sharing it with us. Every song on this album is well thought out and just great fun to listen to. Steve Howe's guitar work is brilliant, as is all their playing. Songs that stand out for me are LISTEN, CHILDREN, THERE WAS A TIME, but EVERY song is great. Do yourself a favor, get this and be happy there is still music like this being created.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne makes a return to making a quality album with `Scream'. Not since his epic and classic album `No More Tears' has Ozzy put out an exceptional album. If you are looking for `Blizzard of Oz' or `Dairy of a Madman' this may not be the album for you. Without a doubt this album is better then the mediocre `Down to Earth' or the industrial sounding `Black Rain'. Ozzy isn't breaking any new ground really with `Scream' but once again he demonstrates why he is considered a metal god.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is a GREAT album. I will forever be an Eminem fan, that I will admit first. However his last couple albums have been stair stepping down one at a time and I am happy to say that this one reverses that trend. This really is a great eminem album, might take a couple of times through to really appreciate it but it is very \\"old eminem\\" without all of the personal drama. i enjoyed relapse though it was not really that good. he was forcing it too much, studying serial killers for risqu&eacute; material but this one does not seem forced at all. basically, pick it up....you will most likely enjoy it.
1439148953|5.0|This is by far the best book that I've read this year. I'll reiterate what others have said that it is a fairly simple story of a young woman coming of age in the U.S. There is very little drama. But it is powerful nonetheless. It was one of reading experiences where I felt completely engrossed by the story, and could not put it down. And after I finished the novel, I continued to go back thinking about the characters. It's one of those novels where I so wish the author would write a sequel. Because I would LOVE to know what happened next.
0307594777|5.0|I had previously read the first two[[ASIN:B00312P7SO The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest (Millennium Trilogy, 3) [ABRIDGED 6-CD Set] (Audio CD/Audiobook)]] books in this trilogy and was looking forward to the last one.  I was not dissappointed.  This is a very good series.  It is a shame that Mr Larsson died before writing further adventures.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I think it is quite racy and shows a little more than I was prepared for at first, but as I watched more episodes, I got acclimated to it.  Some of the dialogue is very funny, and I think the interaction between the girls is very realistic.  If everyone had such a support group, there wouldn't be as much call for psychiatrists, and fewer lonely people!
B001V9LRV0|5.0|This four DVD collection is essential: the director's cut of the film, one DVD of extra music and one DVD of interviews. This last DVD is interesting for the technical details and all the material conditions. It is anecdotal and somewhere it misses the essential point: the music - as a representative of the world - of the twentieth century has been through a revolution and Woodstock is the first demonstration (like in science and mathematics) of the total jump of the whites in America, slightly after the British and the Europeans, into endorsing that new music. To find what is so original in that new music is not that difficult today if we have followed the vast research in the whole world about music all along human history. Listen to the DVDs or to the CDs and you will find out that this music has one characteristic that unifies all the styles or nearly: it is polyrhythmic. It is so obvious that discussing the point is pointless. Back in Europe and in the 20s and 30s there had been some attempts in \\"classical\\" or \\"symphonic\\" music to produce polyrhythmia but it had failed to conquer the vast popular public. Popular music was entirely locked up in good old songs and good old monorhythmia. What is polyrhythmia that Mr. Word's Dictionary refuses? It is the fact that a superficial and traditional rhythmic line, generally binary or ternary, covers up and is articulated upon a far faster rhythmic line that can run in multiples of two or three. That faster rhythm can be carried by the modern drums (where do they come from?) or contained in the singing or in the melodious line of one particular instrument, the bass or the lead guitar used as a rhythmic accompaniment. That was invented in the United States of America and was the consequence of a social, political and geo-demographic phenomenon known as the slave trade and slavery. In Africa, music is originally polyrhythmic and the instruments they used are drums and percussions of many very different types from the tam-tam to the water drum. The slower rhythm is the one to which most people dance and the faster rhythm is magic in a way since it can lead to a trance, to vodun (or voodoo) illumination, with or without the help of alcohol or other substances. The Blacks arrived in America and kept their rhythm, their music and used it all the time in the fields. That will produce black music whose first fully developed form will be jazz. Jazz will become a hit thanks to the radio but jazz requires a new instrument, the modern drums of our bands. They more or less took all the instruments from the European tradition and just associated them so that one person could use both hands and both feet to create a rhythmic universe that was by definition polyrhythmic. From Jazz to rock and roll and modern popular music there is only about twenty to thirty years. The radio will make it popular everywhere in the world, would I say, and then television added its own two bits. The whites learned it and started producing their own, the British being ahead with the first bands that managed to move vast audiences and to spread everywhere in the world. The Americans were just going to follow that road. Woodstock is the first time in American history that such a mass of essentially white people gathered to listen to that kind of music, white, black or latino musicians together. That music is polyrhythmic and that creates a mental way of thinking that is interesting. The brain can naturally think and work along several lines at the same time, but if you make it a requirement, a style, a way of thinking it clearly implies people who are different can dance together, can mix and be together. That music is mentally, psychologically, and even psychically multiple and if two, three or four rhythms can live together why should we segregate among people any group as opposed to another, even any gender as opposed to the others. Equality in total diversity, guaranteed diversity in the very recognition of the differences of the others and the particularity of myself as not opposed, not compared but simply contrasted to the others. The world was becoming a symphony of all kinds of things and in the human sphere anything that appeared as a limit was to be gotten rid of. Even grammar for some was fascist. Good riddance. Every single particularity I decided for myself or I assume in myself became a choice and implied that I was myself and unique and that all other human beings around me were themselves and unique and that we could all live in total peace and fraternity or brotherhood or sisterhood or sorority by assuming all these differences and by letting them come to the surface of our life, to the conscience of our brains, to the reality of our existence. The First amendment became the central axle of this new world perfectly in phase and harmony with that polyrhythmic music I am talking of. In other words this polyrhythmic vision is the direct production and embodiment of that first amendment. It became the music of the people for the people by the people. We were leaving Gettysburg behind in history and making it into our flag, banner, motto, ethics. Are we conscious of what I am explaining? Of course not, otherwise I would not have to explain all that. So celebrate Woodstock as the turning point in human history that would never have been possible without the bringing of millions of black Africans to America, even if that was a crime against humanity, and without the globalization that started as soon as Auschwitz was liberated, quite a few years ago.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDrences of the others and the particularity of myself as not opposed, not compared but simply contrasted to the others.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|i ran to the bookstore to buy this after completing the 2nd book on a sunday afternoon.  so glad i made it before closing time because i so needed to find out what was happening with salander.  rarely do i buy hardback editions, but i would have paid anything!  this book delivered!  it was worth every penny.
B003E48AYC|4.0|I saw this at the iMax with some friends with very low expectations.  The movie itself was good escapist entertainment and predictable.  The blu-ray itself was a good transfer and has some good extras.  I'd rent before buying but if you're not expecting a Pixar quality film you probably won't be too disappointed with this film.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|I picked it up as soon as I was aware that it was available, and listened to it as soon as it was unwrapped. I was kind of \\"meh.\\" Nothing *super* catchy. It seemed more mature than their last release, but that was kind of damning with faint praise. That said, I consider it an unwritten rule of music that CDs which you don't hate, but don't love on first listen will end up being amazing after a few more tries. In just such a way, I did find myself listening to this frequently. A good release makes its own context and you have to get into that zone before you can fairly judge it.    There's still a twinge of holier-than-thou in the lyrics. Haley's voicework has grown more impressive ; it's pretty hard to understate this point. I've always felt that if Haley was on American Idol, she'd lose, but she fits her bandmates so well I can hardly imagine anyone else in her place. As impressive as she is, her bandmates still have a characterstic sound and that hasn't gone away. They've gotten no harder, but no softer, either, which in my view places them in a perfect spot for popular hard rock / pop punk / whatever genre you think Paramore is. I want to say it is more of the same, because the sound is the same; but I can't say it is more of the same, because it is so very much an improvement.     Overall, a really excellent release that grew on me in a very big way. I find myself placing it in every ad hoc playlist I whip up; if you enjoyed their last two releases, I expect you will, too.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Any single, professional woman must have this series. The humor.  The product per se is beautiful, the book, the color coded pages. Worth every penny. Must have for powerful single women.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|Every now and then you want a movie which makes you feel good, and which requires no profound internal analysis thereof. All that is expected of you is to involve yourself in a story which unfolds in way which is both calming and desirable. 'Shelter' is one such movie, which has as one of its best selling points, the 'normal' characters. Perhaps it is profound that the gay characters in this movie, are 'normal' in that they are love struck, confused, and yet function as every other person in society. They are not dying of Aids, nor are they subject to the frivolity of stereotypical gay casting. There is no neurosis, but rather an honest exploration of emotions. These gay men work, surf and love.<br /><br />Most pleasing is the peace they find within themselves, despite how other characters react to their relationship. In short, a wonderful portrait of an alternative love, coloured in a way which sensitive without being condescending or stereotypical.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|I'm in love. I never expect to fall head over hills for this movie, I was just curious. And I saw it.  Every thing, the actors, the dresses, the places. I love history and I can see this people did their research. Every body in the movie does such an excellent job that is completely credible and you find your self in the early 1800's. It is so romantic! but not cheesy, and what is best, is a true story. Is so romantic, beautiful, real, sweet, decent. I cried just of the beauty of it. And the music!  It is a must have.  Highly recommend for any body of any age. Must have and enjoy.

B002WYH5N2|5.0|I have listen to the recorded book, I saw the 6 hr. version and even though it was kinda neat to see Lizzie and Darcey get married etc. I truly loved the 2005 version, and I didn't mind the extended ending because it would have seemed to have been a to abrupt ending otherwise.  I can watch it over and over and over.  There wasn't anything I disliked about it, and everyone that I've encouraged to see it have really enjoyed it.
B001HN694K|3.0|Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton is a colorful but somewhat chaotic tale. It would be nice if I could understand what the heck Johnny Depp was saying in this film? He mumbles every line, seriously! His physical comedy is what makes him a fan favorite but when he speaks, I can't stand to hear him. The real scene stealer of this film is newcomer, Mia Wasikowska who plays Alice - she brings a quiet but stubborn quality to the role and I just loved Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, she's a funny little thing! Alice in Wonderland is good but poorly developed, 3 stars for me.

0062009540|5.0|When I heard about the show, I thought it sounded interesting and I wanted to see it. I then found out that it was a book series and I wanted to take a chance on the first one, and I'm glad I did.  I did something that's pretty rare for me, I pretty much read it in one sitting!  It's honestly that good.<br /><br />The plot is interesting. We don't get the entire plot, that's, from what I can guess, is spread out in the series.  In the first one, Allison, Hanna, Spencer, Emily and Aria are best of friends and nothing could tear them apart. Or, so they thought.  One night Alison vanishes. Her friends don't know if she was kidnapped, ran away, or murdered.  It haunts them for years. Then one by one the friends grew apart, and went on with their lives, never really forgetting about Allison. Let's just say that Allison hasn't forgotten about them.  One by one, all of Ali's friends get \\"messages\\" from Ali, and she tells them that she knows all of their dirty little secrets.  Could it be Allison from beyond the grave?  Is Allison still alive?  Could it be a stalker that's Ali told all of their secrets to?  We sort of get an answer by the end of the book, but then that leads to more questions.<br /><br />In all good books, you want to have several things:<br /><br />Great Characters:  This books has them, and all of the characters have their own dirty little secrets that they want kept quiet. Hanna wants to lose weight and to become beautiful. She'll go do drastic measures to get to her needs.  Spencer does something that pretty much isolates her from her family, Emily is exploring her sexuality, and Aria is getting some smoochies from someone that she shouldn't get them from.  This series has great characters.  All of the characters have a lot of depth to them, and make them life like and they all seems to jump off the page at you.<br /><br />Fantastic Writing: As a reader, you want to read something with fantastic writing, and this one has it. The writing is fresh, and has realistic dialogue that isn't over the top.  This also has some pretty neat plot twists. I was actually glued to the book to the final page, and I couldn't wait to get the next one in the series.<br /><br />This is such a fantastic series, I can't say enough good things about it.

0143038419|1.0|So much hype about the book - but it's horrible.  I read it for 20 minutes, skimmed through the whole book for another 10 and thought - that was a waste of 30  minutes and I will waste no more than that!    I was embarrassed for the writer as well as for all the people who have wasted their time.
030726999X|5.0|I have read the two previous to \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" and this series beats any I have ever read. You won't be able to put it down. It is so well written,fast moving, and keeps you entertained from the 1st page to the last.
B000002I2G|3.0|A marked improvement over the mediocrity that permeated \\"Waiting For The Sun\\", this presents the Doors at their most slick, eclectic and experimental. At times this approach works. Curtis Amy's sax solo on \\"Touch Me\\" lifts this number into a thrilling climax as befits its title. I like the strings and oboe solo to \\"Wishful Sinful\\" and Jim sings at his croonful best on this classical piece where darkness lurks beneath.<br /><br />Another success is \\"Runnin' Blue\\" which pays homage to the late Otis Redding. This track intersperses jazz horns with bluegrass and this makes sense because Otis was the most country of all the soul singers. \\"Wild Child\\" is this album's greatest track. This is a mysterious and unsettling blues and everything fits beautifully here. Robbie's bottleneck guitar, John's military beat, Ray's organ rhythm and Jim's vocal carry an implied threat. A classic!<br /><br />From there it either approaches suckdom or else achieves it. \\"Dig It\\" is downright lousy. \\"Easy Ride\\" has its moments but something is missing. And though the title track starts promisingly enough as a suite, it lyrically falls flat by the third vignette and it completely drags musically after Jim's stupid acid trip rap into a montage of nothing. This is a real let down for this had the potential of going through the roof.
B002ZG97RE|2.0|I had read reviews (pro and con) re this films political bent before watching the film.  I knew the film had an anti-WMD tint, but didn't think twice about it -- until I watched the film.  It was way over the top (politically) to the point where it detracted from the movie.  I felt like this movie was directed by Michael Moorer and produced by Keith Obermann.   I'm sensitive when films place our troops as mindless drones and the white house as greedy criminals and present it in a way to make us think that is all factual.  Also, I fell asleep in this film -- simply didn't keep my interest at all.  I couldn't wait for it to end.    Massive disappointment.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I have seen several version of Wuthering Heights over the years, But I feel this is the best.

0375842209|5.0|I'm late to the parade. In 2006, \\"The Book Thief\\" was hailed as a masterpiece and sold millions of copies. Somehow I missed it, but that wrong has been corrected.<br /><br />The story's narrator is Death itself. Death watches over the tragedy of World War II, zeroing in on a young girl near Munich, Germany, who becomes a book thief. Liesel steals a book from a Nazi bonfire, snags one from the home of the mayor's wife, and later feeds her love for words in other ways as well. In the course of the story, we meet her adopted parents, a loving, accordion-playing father and a staunch but goodhearted mother. We see the inklings of first love, between Liesel and her neighborhood friend Rudy. And we watch Liesel and her parents hide a Jewish fist-fighter named Max. The horrors of the period are never candy-coated, yet never wallowed in either. This is a rich peek into the heart of wartime Germany, and the stalwart souls who found love, peace, and strength despite Hitler's insanity.<br /><br />Marcus Zusak's novel deserves the praise it has received. He writes with a deceptively winsome style, full of evocative language, metaphors, and deep themes. He gives Death, as a narrator, lots of . . . well, life. Here's one tidbit from Death: \\"To me, war is like the new boss who expects the impossible. He stands over your shoulder . . . So you work harder. You get the job done. The boss, however, does not thank you. He asks for more.\\"<br /><br />Zusak blends the themes of Ursula Hegi's \\"Stones from the River\\" with literary inventiveness and unflinching hope. His story will be enjoyed by teens and adults for years to come. Many of the best novels are now marketed as YA (young adult) books, with writers from Michael Chabon to Suzanne Collins to Neil Gaiman leading the way. It seems that while adults are gluttons for mindless and often artless entertainment, along the lines of Vince Flynn and Danielle Steele, books for the YA market are often struggling with the questions of youth, of love, of death and tragedy and war. Like idealistic teens, they demand answers to Life's tough questions. And, through the words of Marcus Zusak, Death offers up a few answers.y and war.

030745455X|5.0|I read The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and thought it was excellent.  The Girl Who Played With Fire is the perfect follow-up to the first book in the Trilogy.  This is a \\"can't put it down\\" thriller.  Usually I can skip a page or two in a book and not lose any content.  That's not the case with these books.  The author develops his characters with just enough information so your imagination is free to fill in the rest.  And it's a literate book - I haven't been this excited about an author and his books since the DaVinci Code.  I highly recommend this read.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This will be short as it is my first review of anything here.  Being a fan of all rap and hip-hop, as well as following everything Eminem has ever done, I must say that this is by far his best album to date.  I really think the entire Relapse(with the constant arab accent) was just a teaser album for this wonderful piece of work he has done.  Some say its not good without the Dr. Dre beats.....? I love Dre too but maybe he needs to branch out more and work with other producers. I LOVE IT!!!  Going thru changes is my favorite tune so far!

Don't get me wrong...there are enough good tracks on this cd for JJ fans to be satisfied however I don't think the songs are as memorable as \\"In Between Dreams\\". The cd starts off great however it seems to get repetitive and boring towards the end. Sorry...hoping the next one is better...

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I'm so glad and frustrated that the Beatles took so long to remaster their albums. First off....I grew so tired of the poor audio quality of their cd's that was initially released in 87 that I just didn't want to listen to those thin sounding cd's any longer. Well they are finally remastered and its awesome. Each one of the remastered cd's is a great listen and you will notice sounds that you haven't heard before. I truly love every one of the cd's with the exception of \\"Yellow Submarine\\". A good investment for any fan of rock music.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Based on his complete library, Eminem's career seems like it may be cyclical. His first three albums were all classics and they were followed by an album that I believe was good, but not good enough in Encore.   After Encore, Eminem went away for about half a decade before coming out with Relapse which reintroduced him into the mainstream.   I really think that in the course of Eminem's career it can be split into two different eras. An era that included the Slim Shady LP through Encore, and a 2nd era that began with Relapse and is now continuing on through Recovery.  Now, let me explain this. If you look at Eminem's first major album (not talking about infinite) SSLP and compare it to Relapse I think they are similar. They both are full of shock value and one-liners. And while the SSLP is considered a classic and Relapse is considered a flop I think that's because the SSLP was his debut and people expected more out of Relapse.  Now as the cycle goes on you'd have to compare his two sophomore albums. Of the first era the MMLP and of this era which would be Recovery. Again, even though those two albums sound quite different I think they achieve the same goal. They expand upon their respective predecessor to introduce us into the real workings of Marshall Mathers' mind. In MMLP, Eminem opened himself up to show us his anger at basically everybody including his family, the media, and his fans. In Recovery, Eminem opens himself up to show us his fear of losing his daughter and his depression from the loss of Proof and his struggle with drugs.   I believe Recovery is this era's Marshall Mathers LP based on the brutal honesty Eminem includes in this album. Now, I think we can expect another The Eminem Show type album to follow this one that won't be as focused on his drug dependency and loss of Proof, but will instead let him take assault on any topic he feels needs addressed by the greatest rapper alive. Hopefully, after that album there will not be another Encore.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|What else can I say that already hasn't been said about this album. This truly is a great rock record by the Stones. Not my favorite as \\"Let It Bleed\\" wins out the top spot but \\"Exile\\" is not to far off. The bonus tracks on disc 2 are pretty good especially tracks 1-4. Well worth the investment if you don't have Exile yet and want to listen to it in excellent remastered sound. Get it!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|This Album is genius.... I feel like I am listening to the dawn of a new era and for the first time in a very long time, a true \\"Album\\" has been born. Think of every major music genre of the last Century and blend it all in the petri dish that exists only in Oz and you've got the beginning of the musical Journey that is The ArchAndroid. It shouldn't work but it does and then some...... Buy this and make your world a more interesting, fun place to live! I hope Janelle sticks around for a long time....I can only imagine what she will produce as she begins to mature... what a unique and brillant talent she is.
0307454541|5.0|This book is fast-moving with several plots going on at the same time which means one has to pay attention to all the diverse characters.  I found the book very entertaining, informative, and suspenseful so that it kept my interest throughout.  I recommend it for all those who love a mystery.  One of the main characters is a strong, no nonsense young woman who gives as good as she gets.  Following her various encounters makes the book move along quickly.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|**SPOILERS** I liked this film overall. Good story. Good Revenge. Bad Jamie Foxx performance ESPECIALLY the ending! Jamie Foxx in Ray was awesome but in this film just did not cut it as an intelligent (or I should say more intelligent than Gerard Butlers) character. His lines were weak and the ending, rushing a high-powered explosive to that cell that quickly?! No way. I did enjoy Gerard Butler and his intelligence in this film. The kill scenes were cool and while the entire film was of course only somewhat believable I enjoyed it. Denzel Washington would have been awesome as his opponent in my opinion. Will probably buy it when it goes for much less.
030745455X|1.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I felt compelled to this time. The title sums it up, but... The Girl Who Played with Fire was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. I somehow got over halfway through it, and then realized that there are too many good books out there to waste time on this one.<br /><br />I actually liked the first book: it moved along well, the plot was good, and the dialogue, if not entirely well written, was credible. That's the exact opposite of this book. In this one, the dialogue is stilted, the \\"plot\\" is lame, and the book just plods along. As others have noted, there are long descriptions of what Salander buys when she's shopping: at Ikea, at the grocery store, at clothing stores. The entire first section of the book is completely unconnected to the main plot or to the rest of the book, at least as far as I can tell. The dialogue is laughable: at first I thought it was a translation issue, but I came to realize it was just really bad writing. As for the book being a \\"mystery\\", to me it was no mystery who committed the murders. I'm not sure how it was a mystery novel.<br /><br />Then there are the little things that bothered me. Do banks in Sweden not have to report a transfer from an offshore account of two million kronor? Maybe the laws there are different than they are in the US, but I highly doubt they're that different. And the fact that men are always covering up for Salander: she says, \\"let's not go the police\\" and a man says \\"okay\\" every time. Really? The way that men are portrayed in general was also highly annoying to me (I'm a woman, by the way). Every man who didn't believe in/like Salander was a misogynistic cretin, while those that stuck up for her were a-okay. And finally, the thing I found most annoying, was how whatever happened to Salander (I stopped reading before I found out what, because I didn't care) was called \\"All the evil\\". In quotes, just like that. Even when we're Salander's head as she's thinking about it. Who puts quotes around something, in their head, while they're thinking about it? Ridiculous.<br /><br />I'm baffled by all the good reviews of this book, but I will say that if you enjoy well-written books you will certainly be disappointed by this one. If you do decide to read it, do yourself a favor and get it from the library.d something, in their head, while they're thinking about it? Ridiculous.

030726999X|5.0|The third book of the trilogy by Stieg Larsson. This ties everything together. Very well written and translated. Lots of excitement and surprises like the other two books. You want more after reading the three books. A must read for anyone who likes an action/suspense novel.

B002T45VX6|3.0|I loved Shikira's early work. It was the perfect blend of Latin, World Beat and at times Hip Hop. This is not a bad Cd, in fact it is one of my favorite workout CD's. What is missing is the uniqueness that is/was Shikira. I first heard the cut \\"Gypsy\\" live on YouTube accompanied by Arabic instruments. I liked it much better than the album version. I'm from New Orleans and what has happened to her is the same thing that happens to many of our local artists who sign with major record companies. The big guys just can't lay off the \\"vanilla button\\" and everything they touch sounds the same. Gone are the producers like the legendary Tom Dowd who actually listened to what an artist had to say and knew how to bring out THEIR best. I guess the best we can hope for at this point is a live acoustic Cd recorded in a less controlled environment like Austin City Limits.

030726999X|5.0|Stieg Larsson comes at his only work as a outsider of the novel writing world and comes at the action as a real world investigator, facts do not always add up, there are so many diperate lines of facts that its tough to see how they will all fit together ... the charecters are all so loveable and very Swedish and they drink so much coffee, and then they die ... sometimes it is too intense ...
6305428042|5.0|This is the funniest Halloween Movie I have ever seen.  Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy are excellently cast and hilariously funny.  I also love Bette Middler's singing of \\"I Put a Spell On You\\" at the Halloween Party.  I plan to watch this movie every Halloween.  This movie and Monty Python's Holy Grail are about the only two movies I have ever seen who continue to deliver laughs and lighten my spirit no matter how many times I've watched them.  Penny Marshall and Garry Marshall also have hilarious bits.  I don't know why this movie did not do well in the theater as it has a very funny script, wonderful performers and reminds me of the fun of Halloween when I was a kid.  (P.S. I am a Pagan and I know witches are not at all like this stereotype--but their stereotypical depiction are nevertheless very funny.  Real witches, like real fairies are nothing like what Hollywood depicts them--but the \\"fakes\\" are still very funny.)

B000IHSKUM|5.0|I was looking for a comfortable pair of sandals that offered some kind of toe protection. A friend had a pair of the Keen Newports and liked them.<br /><br />They are comfortable and versatile. You can snug up the elastic speed laces ore leave them loose. The sandals stay on either way. Add a pair of socks and they'll look like shoes for the times when sandals are too casual.

B002SF9YNO|3.0|Quiet, wry story of a failed celloist who moves back to his hometown and finds a job ritually preparing bodies in front of the deceased's family, readying them for the coffin and cremation. Most of the 2 hour film was unfamiliar and unexpected. Then came the predictable ending that ruined it for me -- altho some may find it heartwarming.<br /><br />Moves at the pace of a funeral tune, not surprisingly. An odd sensation accompanied me thru out the film -- I definitely would not want this being done to me! Gloomy photography perhaps enhanced the mood -- but put me off further. Good actors, however.<br /><br />Different -- and interesting becuz of that.
B0038ZITHK|4.0|Each movie of this set is good in it's own way. Actors, all of them, were good. The depiction, set-up of East Harlem area was rightly depressing and audience cannot miss the abject poverty and low-grade of life in those blocks of the great New York. The violence was shown in a very clever manner--gory, bloody scenes without too much blood.   The young protagonist of the first one Carlito's Rise, was very good. Of course, there is no escape from Hollywood sensationalism, and that's forgivable.  Overall a good show.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|My son talked me into reading these books with him, and we loved them.    When we went to see the new Harry Potter movie, scenes for it came on during the trailers.     He recognized the story the second the preview started.  He was thrilled, and so was I.  What potential this unique and fun series had for a movie--or movies...I mean, they advertised that it was being brought to us by the people who make the Harry Potter movies.      The Potter movies stay so true to the book--taking care to absolutely keep things in the screenplay that are necessary to the plot line.      I wish I could say the same for this movie.      When it finally came out, we went to a movie theater in NJ that was right across the river from NYC.    We could see the Empire State building from the theater parking lot, and took it as a sign that the movie was going to rock.  We were so psyched to see it.      When we left the theater, I thought my son was going to cry, and I couldn't un-scrunch my eyebrows--huh?? I felt so bad for him, for me, for Rick Riordan...      We understand that it's impossible to make a movie exactly like a book-- but this was a travesty.   Every important aspect of the story was by-passed for the sake of special effects.      It's almost as if the screenwriter had been given a verbal summary of what the book was about, and took it from there. So many important plot points were left out or down right changed to the point that it would be impossible to even think about a sequel.      It's such a shame.  These stories have the \\"book made to movie\\" potential of the Potter series, or dare I say, a kids \\"Lord of the Rings\\".      If someone with vision had just read the books, the money used to make it could have been so much better spent.      It could have been knocked out of the park, but, alas, the ball was dropped and we all lost.

B003RNXIBK|5.0|I'll keep it brief - once again, he makes everyone look like amatuers.  Drake who??  Kanye who???  Lil Wayne who???      His best lyrical assault since Marshal Mathers.  The flow, the beats, everything about it is great.  I love that he's injecting more positivity in more of his songs but they still hit you hard.    He's one of the few that will still be in the game 20 years from now.  All the others can only dream of coming out with a killer album ten years from now.........
B001C4AFOY|5.0|The movie arrived very timely after being ordered, and it arrived in perfect condition.  Loved the movie, it was finely acted, historically accurate and beautifully filmed.  I hope a sequel is in the works.  This was an important moment in time, a true story told about one of the most powerful and longest reigning monarchs in history.  \\"Young Victoria\\" is a must see and should be required by Middle Schools for viewing. Considering our society has adopted the \\"princess\\" title for all the little girls to embrace it might be wise to give them a look into what being a princess truly demands. The movie touches on the power of a good marriage, the societal views of women at the time, political influences challenging Victoria when she became a young queen, and the balancing of her family and her duty, not so far away from what most women face everyday in their lives today. Queen Victoria was considered the \\"Grandmother of Europe\\", currently the majority of the Monarchy in the UK and Europe.
B003HTPHSQ|3.0|I hate to say it, but I found this album somewhat tedious to get through all in one sitting because, well, it's kind of boring to be perfectly blunt. I have no criticism of the blues genre or the idea of Cyndi Lauper dabbling in it, because if there's one thing I've always loved about her it's her ability to shake things up and branch out with her music. As far as I'm concerned she's never had one artistic misfire, commercial success be darned.<br /><br />In the case of Memphis Blues, however, I feel the songs she's chosen would be much better suited to a live set, since they are built around a good amount of improvisation, call & response, and a high level of energy that seems lost on the CD recordings. Even her voice, which is typically raw and majestic and one of the best in the industry, is somewhat subdued and restrained as if she were reading from a page. Whether this is normal for blues albums, I can't really say, but for Cyndi Lauper it seems like a step backwards. (Although Cyndi Lauper on a bad day is still better than anything else you'll hear on the radio.) Some of the songs are cute and will get your head bopping, but overall I felt she failed to make the songs truly \\"hers.\\" So I give her an A for effort, but I just can't bring myself to blindly gush about it like the other reviewers (who will surely come after my head for this), and being a fan for many years I'd like to think my opinion is somewhat informed and reasonable.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|This is a small bag perfect for todays subcompact camcorders.   The brand-name is amazon's own but it seems to be great guality for a company that never made bags before.  I especially like the zipper-pulls which are soft, easy to grip, and flexible. There is one main compartment, 2 side pockets, and a flat pouch in the front- all with zippers.    Overall, a great product.
0307269752|5.0|Excellent piece of writing.  Great story with interesting characters.  I'm already looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
0307454541|1.0|I eagerly picked up this book since it seems to be all the rage in the U.S. I was very disappointed in the poor writing and/or poor translation of the story. There are plenty of clunky, overly descriptive passages to wade through. The most disturbing aspect of the book, however, is the way the author treats sex. The main character leads a rather unrealistic, middle aged fantasy life, which includes a long term relationship with a beautiful married woman with whom he owns a business. She's fine with him sleeping around. He's fine with her being married, of course. No strings! He also manages to inspire the much younger female protagonist to want to jump his bones. Worse are the scenes of sexual sadism towards women which gave me pause. It made me wonder how much the author was indulging his own bizarre fantasies throughout. (Even worse, the paperback copy of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo includes the prologue from the next book in the series which is a description of a thirteen year old girl held captive for more than forty days by a sexual deviant. Goodness.) Oh yes, and there's the big mystery of the Vangar family which is frankly a big letdown and certainly not worth the convoluted build up.

1400052173|5.0|Very rarely in the creative world is there a work that will stand the test of time that brings forth important information on potentially difficult topics in an interesting, artistic and entertaining way. `The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' by Rebecca Skloot is that rare gem.<br /><br />Here is the synopsis of this remarkable book:<br /><br />`The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' tells the rich, enthralling story of Henrietta Lack, the forgotten woman behind one of the most important tools in modern medicine, and of Lack's descendants, many of whom feel betrayed by the scientific establishment.<br />Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells - taken without her knowledge - became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first \\"immortal\\" human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, thought she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile up all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons - as much as a hundred Empire States Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb's effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.<br />Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.<br />Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the \\"colored\\" ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells, from Henrietta's small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia - a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo - to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.<br />Henrietta's family did not learn of her \\"immortality\\" until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a billion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family - past and present - is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.<br />Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca Skloot became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family - especially Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother's cells. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important, why couldn't her children afford health insurance?<br />Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.<br /><br />Here is the biography of this author:<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot ([...]) is a science writer whose articles have appeared in The New York Times Magazine; O, The Oprah Magazine; Discover; Prevention; Glamour; and others. She has worked as a correspondent for NPR's Radio Lab and PBS's NOVA scienceNOW, and is a contributing editor at Popular Science magazine. A former vice president of the National Book Critics Circle, she is on the faculty at the University of Memphis, where she teaches creative nonfiction, and she blogs at Culture Dish, hosted by Seed Magazine's science blogs. Skloot ([...]) has an undergraduate degree in biomedical science from Colorado State University and an MFA in nonfiction from the University of Pittsburgh. She lives in Memphis, Tennessee. This is her first book.<br /><br />Rebecca has established a scholarship fund for the descendents of Henrietta Lacks. Donations can be made at [...].<br /><br />And here is a feature story about Henrietta and Rebecca discussing this book:<br /><br />[...].<br /><br />Admittedly, this book is a little different than the types of books I usually review. But when I heard about this book and read the synopsis, I knew I wanted to read it. It covers many of the topics of interest to me - science, medical research, mistreatment of minorities, etc...<br /><br />By way of introduction, Rebecca explains how Henrietta Lacks's cells have been used over the years:<br /><br />Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers. Their chromosome and proteins have been studied with such details that scientists know their every quirk. Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse. (p. 4)<br /><br />Rebecca explains that she and Deborah, Henrietta's daughter, couldn't be more different:<br /><br />Deborah and I came from very different cultures: I grew up white and agnostic in the Pacific Northwest, my roots half New York Jew and half Midwestern Protestant; Deborah was a deeply religious black Christian from the South. I tended to leave the room when religion came up in conversation because it made me uncomfortable; Deborah's family tended toward preaching, faith healings, and sometimes voodoo. She grew up in a black neighborhood that was one of the poorest and most dangerous in the country; I grew up in a safe, quiet middle-class neighborhood in a predominantly white city and went to high school with a total of two black students. I was a science journalist who referred to all things supernatural as \\"woo-woo stuff\\"; Deborah believed Henrietta's spirit lived on in her cells, controlling the lives of anyone who crossed its path. Including me. (p. 7)<br /><br />At the time that Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer, the tissue samples were taken from her. Not only was that shocking, but so also was the method of treatment - the insertion of the radium tube seems quite primitive (fair warning...):<br /><br />With Henrietta unconscious on the operating table in the center of the room, her feet in stirrups, the surgeon on duty, Dr. Lawrence Wharton, Jr. sat on a stool between her legs. He peered inside Henrietta, dilated her cervix, and prepared to treat the tumor. But first - though no one had told Henrietta that TeLinde was collecting samples or asked if she wanted to be a donor - Wharton picked up a sharp knife and shaved two dime-sized pieces of tissue from Henrietta's cervix; one from her tumor, and one from the healthy cervical tissue nearby. Then he placed the samples in a glass dish.<br />Wharton slipped a tube filled with radium inside Henrietta's cervix, and sewed it in place. He sewed a plaque filled with radium to the outer surface of her cervix and packed another plaque against it. He slid several rolls of gauze inside her vagina to help keep the radium in place, then threaded a catheter into her bladder so she could urinate without disturbing the treatment. (p. 33)<br /><br />The tissue was passed along to Dr. George Gey, head of tissue culture research at Johns Hopkins, where they grew amazingly quickly:<br /><br />But Henrietta's cells weren't just surviving, they were growing with mythological intensity. By the next morning, they'd doubled. Mary [Dr. Gey's wife] divided the contents of each tube into two, giving them room to grow, and within twenty-four hours, they'd doubled again. Soon she was dividing them into four tubes, then six. Henrietta's cells grew to fill as much space as Mary [Dr. Gey's assistant] gave them. (p. 40)<br /><br />Dr. Gey distributed the cells worldwide:<br /><br />He sent shipments of HeLa cells to researchers in Texas, India, New York, Amsterdam, and many places between. Those researchers gave them to more researchers, who gave them to still more. Henrietta's cells rode into the mountains of Chile in the saddlebags of pack mules. As Gey flew from one lab to another, demonstrating his cultural techniques and helping to set up new laboratories, he always flew with tubes of Henrietta's cells in his breast pocket. And when scientists visited Gey's lab to learn his techniques, he usually sent them home with a vial or two of HeLa. In letters, Gey and some of his colleagues began referring to the cells as \\"his precious babies.\\"<br />The reasons Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cell without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromised rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter - scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again. (pp. 57-58)<br /><br />Henrietta was very aware that her cancer was spreading:<br /><br />In early June, Henrietta told her doctors several times that she thought the cancer was spreading, that she could feel it moving through her, but they found nothing wrong with her. \\"The patient states that she feels fairly well,\\" one doctor wrote in her chart, \\"however she continues to complain of some vague lower abdominal discomfort...No evidence of recurrence. Return in one month.\\"<br />There's no indication that Henrietta questioned him; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when \\"benevolent deception\\" was a common practice - doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. (p. 63)<br /><br />On a personal note, my mother had told me that her father, who died of lung cancer in the 1950s, was never told that he had the disease. Being the skeptic that I can be, I have a hard time accepting the idea that people don't question their doctors, even in the present day.<br /><br />I was appalled at some of the medical practices that Rebecca included in her book. This example is in a chapter entitled `Illegal, Immoral, and Deplorable' - aptly titled:<br /><br />As HeLa grew like crabgrass in laboratories around the world, a virologist named Chester Southam had a frightening thought: What if Henrietta's cancer cells could infect the scientists working on them? Gey and several others had already shown that some rats grew tumors with live HeLa. Why not humans?<br />Southam was a well-respected cancer researcher and chief of virology at Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. He and many other scientists believed that cancer was caused by either a virus or an immune system deficiency, so Southam decided to use HeLa to test those theories.<br />In February, 1954, Southam loaded a syringe with saline solution mixed with HeLa. He slid the needle into the forearm of a woman who'd recently been hospitalized for leukemia, then pushed the plunger, injecting about five million of Henrietta's cells into her arm. Using a second needle, Southam tattooed a tiny speck of India ink next to the small bump that formed at the HeLa injection site. That way, he'd know where to look when he reexamined the woman days, weeks, and months later, to see if Henrietta'scancer was growing on her arm. He repeated the process with about a dozen other cancer patients. He told them he was testing their immune systems; he said nothing about injecting them with someone else's malignant cells.<br />Within hours, the patient's forearms grew red and swollen. Five to ten days later, hard nodules began growing at the injection sites. Southam removed some of the nodules to verify that they were cancerous, but he left several to see if the patient's immune system would reject them or the cancer would spread. Within two weeks, some of the nodules had grown to two centimeters - about the size of Henrietta's tumor when she went in for her radium treatments.<br />Southam eventually removed most of the HeLa tumors, and those he didn't remove vanished on their own in a few months. But in four patients, the nodules grew back. He removed them, but they returned again and again. In one patient, Henrietta's cancer cells metastasized to her lymph nodes. (p. 128)<br /><br />Southam went on to solicit volunteers in the Ohio State Penitentiary in order to inject healthy patients. His tactics reminded me of those of Dr. Josef Mengele, the notorious `Angel of Death' in Nazi Germany, who conducted unspeakable experiments on concentration camp prisoners.<br /><br />Many organizations profited from the HeLa cells:<br /><br />There's no record of [Johns] Hopkins or Gey accepting money for HeLa cells, but many for-profit cell banks and biotech companies have. Microbiological Associates- which later became part of Invitrogen and Bio Whittaker, two of the largest biotech companies in the world - got its start selling HeLa. Since Microbiological Associates was privately owned and sold many other biological products, there's no way to know how much of its revenue came specifically from HeLa. The same is true for many other companies. What we do know is that today, Invitrogen sells products that cost anywhere from $100 to nearly $10,000 per vial. A search in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office databases turns up more than seventeen thousand patents involving HeLa cells. And there's no way to quantify the professional gain many scientists have achieved with the help of HeLa. (p. 194)<br /><br />Although no one is sure why Henrietta's cells are `immortal,' Ms. Skloot explains how they are:<br /><br />By the early nineties, a scientist at Yale had used HeLa to discover that human cancer cells contain an enzyme called telomerase that rebuilds their telomeres. The presence of telomerase means cells could keep regenerating their telomeres indefinitely. This explains the mechanisms of HeLa's immortality: telomerase constantly rewound the ticking clock at the end of Henrietta's chromosomes so they never grew old and never died. It was this immortality, and the strength with which Henrietta's cells grew, that made it possible for HeLa to take over so many other cultures - they simply outlived any other cells they encountered. (p. 217)<br /><br />Henrietta's nephew, Gary, shared with Rebecca his beliefs about how he thought God used Henrietta, and Rebecca's interpretation of same:<br /><br />....\\"Those cells are Henrietta,\\" he said, taking back the Bible and opening it to the Books of Romans. \\"Read this,\\" he said, pointing to a chunk of text. I started reading to myself and he covered the Bible with his hand. \\"Out loud,\\" he said.<br />So I read aloud from the Bible, for the first time in my life: \\"Those who believe in me will live, even though they die; and those who live and believe in me will never die\\"...<br />\\"Henrietta was chosen,\\" Gary whispered. \\"And when the Lord chooses an angel to do his work, you never know what they going to come back looking like.\\"<br />Gary pointed at another passage and told me to keep reading. \\"There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, the beauty that belongs to heavenly bodies is different from the beauty that belongs to earthly bodies\\"...<br />I kept reading: \\"This is how it will be when the dead areraised to life. When the body is buried, it is mortal; when raised, it will be immortal. There is, of course, a physical body, so there has to be a spiritual body.\\"<br />\\"HeLa?\\" I asked Gary. \\"You're saying HeLa is her spiritual body?\\"<br />Gary smiled and nodded.<br />In that moment, reading those passages, I understood completely how some of the Lackses could believe, without doubt, that Henrietta had been chosen by the Lord to become an immortal being. If you believe the Bible is the literal truth, the immortality of Henrietta's cells makes perfect sense. Of course they were growing and surviving decades after her death, of course they floated through the air, and of course they'd lead to cures for diseases and had been launched into space. Angels are like that. The Bible tells us so...<br />Jesus told his followers, \\"I give them eternal life, and they shall never die.\\" Plain, simple, to the point.<br />\\"You better be careful,\\" Gary told me. \\"Pretty soon you're gonna find yourself converted.\\"<br />\\"I doubt it,\\" I told him, and we both laughed.<br />He slid the Bible from my hands and flipped to another passage, then handed it back, pointing at one sentence: \\"When do you who are here find it impossible to believe that God raises the dead?\\"<br />\\"You catch my drift?\\" he said, smiling a mischievous grin.<br />I nodded, and Gary closed the Bible in my hands. (pp. 295-296)<br /><br />In the Afterword, Ms. Skloot made a very valuable point regarding the medical industry:<br /><br />The debate over the commercialization of human biological material always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin's antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, \\"Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.\\" On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. \\"I think it's fair to say it's interfered with science,\\" he said. \\"It's changed the spirit.\\" Now there are patients and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. \\"Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That's boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it's also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.\\" (p. 325)<br /><br />Ms. Skloot ([...]) did an incredible job in her research with regards to how the corporate medical industry has treated minorities and `the least of these' over the years, as well as many other interesting topics. I thought I was reading about Hitler's Nazi Germany at some points (another topic of great interest to me). The way the Lacks family was treated is deplorable, in my opinion. I am so grateful for what Ms. Skloot has done on their behalf, and how they are finally being made whole to the extent that they can be sixty years after their mother's death. I am also glad to see that many of her children and their children are finally get to the point of forgiveness - looking at the good that Henrietta's cells have done for mankind over the last sixty years as opposed to holding on to the idea that they have been robbed. However, I still am incredulous that there are some people and organizations out there that have profited tremendously from the HeLa cell line (you can order a vial of your own online on many different sites).<br /><br />This is a remarkable book; it completely lived up to my high expectations! It is the type of book I'd like to read again, and I am not normally a more-than-once book reader. It is written at a level that is understandable to the scientists and the non-scientists (that would be me!) in the crowd. The structure was incredible; she had to interweave the medical aspect, the family aspect and ethical/racial aspect, and Rebecca kept the story moving along in a brilliant fashion. With her education background in biomedical science and nonfiction writing, it is as though she was born to be the person to bring Henrietta and her family's story to the light of day for some many more people. I truly am glad to see its success, and hope to see Ms. Skloot captures some awards for this decade-long labor of love.<br /><br />There have been several developments since the release of this book in February; it remains on the New York Times Bestseller List. In May 2010, HBO announced that Oprah Winfrey and Alan Ball would develop a film project based on Skloot's book; I am greatly looking forward to that.

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I got this last summer right after the tragedy, and it's been in the car ever since.<br />An awesome collection, you can even say the definitive collection.<br />If you had a friend who somehow has never heard MJ's music before, then this is the collection to show him/her.<br />Your all-time favorites are here, as well as a few hidden gems.<br />Plus the DVD with the video footage is awesome.<br />Do yourself a favor and get and enjoy this collection.<br /><br />My 2 cents (my top 5 MJ songs):<br /><br />5. Earth Song<br />4. Black or White<br />3. Billy Jean<br />2. Smooth Criminal<br />1. Beat It
B003GJSUIQ|5.0|I love James Horner's [[ASIN:B00005BJJX Aliens: The Deluxe Edition]] and [[ASIN:B002IAPHK8 Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]. [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] ranks up there as a great soundtrack. It has some haunting themes that really evoke an alien world. However, it isn't particularly memorable. After listening to it all day, I can't recall any of the main [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] themes. By contrast, when I first heard [[ASIN:B00005BJJX Aliens]], I couldn't get the battle song out of my head for days. Even more annoying, some of the later songs on [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] feature alien voices, so it's certainly not something you can listen to with company around (I had [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] on in my room while doing work, and my wife asked me what those odd voices were). Still, if you like movie soundtracks, I can definitely recommend Horner's [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] for your soundtrack collection.    Make sure you get the Deluxe edition ([[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]]) - it has 6 additional tracks and 20 minutes of additional music! I think the 6 bonus tracks are some of the better ones (I particularly like the Viperwolves), so it's probably worth it if you loved the original album.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|All of Michael Jackson's great songs from his Thriller album.  Crystal clear sound.  Brings back memories from the 80's.
B0037W68F4|5.0|I really like the direction MGMT is going. Great album very different from their first but not diverging from their synth pop sounds. an A+ on this one
B003954I9C|4.0|I'm defitenly a Backstreet Boys fan.  I've always enjoyed A.J.'s voice the most and it's fun having a album of just him.  Some of my favorite songs are London, Sincerely Yours, and Drive By Love.  He peformed Drive By Love at one of the Backstreet Boys concerts so that was really fun to hear live.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I bought this record after hearing an interview of Natalie Merchant on \\"Woman's Hour\\" on BBC Radio 4.  Natalie said she had sung these songs to her daughter and I thought my grandchildren might like them.   The album contains beautiful settings in a wide variety of styles of many different types of poem, both famous and obscure. They are whitty, charming, often amusing and sometimes a bit violent like the sleepy giant who used to eat boys. I particulary love the full bodied horn arrangement on \\"The Land of Nod\\", the aural equivalent of a nice warm bed. However, although they are a bit too sophisticated for most of my grandchildren, they do delight their grandfather.     The album is beautifully produced and includes a book containing lovely notes and photographs about each poem and its author, which give much more than the usual lyrics listings provided in most CDs.    Give your senses a treat, buy the CD set, don't just download the songs.
0767812387|4.0|I recommend this film for watching when it's cold and rainy. Both main characters are good looking and energetic. This music is what got it for me. You cannot watch this movie without being enraptured by the Cuban beat.
0143058525|5.0|Enjoyable listening to Liz tell her story. Well worth the time to listen to the audio book.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I saw this movie with my son and his children while visiting. Enjoyed it very much and bought it when I got home to add to my collection. The story line was excellent and I was enthralled by the use of color and the imagination showing this wonderful world.
B000UBMWG4|4.0|All the versions look beautiful in HD. Everything the Blade Runner fan could ever want is included here, and the price is great considering how much material you get. The only downside is that the box is very flimsy - on of the hinges on the disc \\"flaps\\" had snapped on mine. Shame - I would rather have spent a couple more bucks and have a more substantial box to keep this classic safe and secure.
B003C1SS1M|5.0|The extra reggae track is reason enough to buy this album.  The LP starts a bit too sudden in my opinion, but still, a GREAT buy.
0066620996|5.0|I'll start by saying that I did NOT like some of Jim Collins' other books (Build to Last and How the Mighty Fall).  These other books either went to popular companies and asked them why they were great (they weren't that great and they didn't know anyway) or they looked at failed companies and tried to apply preconceived notions on why they failed (they failed to get to the root problems).  Having said all of that...<br /><br />Good to Great is the best business book of the decade.<br /><br />The concepts are so profound and simple... and represent a paradigm shift in business theory.  Great leaders are humble, common, and you've never heard of most of them.  Start with getting the right people on the bus and in the right seats.  Great companies know their \\"Hedgehog\\" including what they are best at, passionate about, and what drives resources to them.  As for technology, it is a tactic that can support the great purpose (but not BE the purpose).  Incredibly powerful!
030726999X|5.0|I still haven't finished reading it, but only because I haven't had enough time in my hands yet. I am really enjoying this book just as I enjoyed the previous two. EXCELLENT READ!
B000VK6MNI|4.0|When he's not publicly advocating for the tobacco industry (a seemingly daunting task), lobbyist Nick Naylor (Eckhart) hangs at a D.C. tavern booth with two fellow \\"merchants of death,\\" a firearms tout (Koechner) and alcohol spokeswoman (Bello). Friendly but competitive chats of this \\"M.O.D. Squad\\" often entail how many die annually from products they espouse, the point being: the more dangerous the product, the more lofty its spokesman's mission.<br /><br />Nick is fearless in his defense of Big Tobacco. On panel shows, he runs smoke rings around cancer patients, scientific studies and experts who declare that cigarettes are deadly. When tasked with increasing movie product placement to supplement his employers' new \\"smoking is cool\\" campaign, Nick takes his adoring 12-year-old son (Bright) along so he can watch daddy in action.<br /><br />Eventually, Big T's front man grows a conscience, albeit not a fully developed one. He grudgingly admits to the hazards of smoking but hedges by falling back on the right of ADULTS to choose and the personal responsibility this entails. The correct message is sent when a horrified Nick instinctively knocks a lit ciggie from his boy's mouth during an impromptu press conference.<br /><br />Of special note are Robert Duvall's amusing caricature of a tobacco company CEO, William H. Macy's virulently anti-smoking senator from Vermont, Rob Lowe as a kimono-clad Hollywood producer and Sam Elliott's cancer-stricken yet mercenary Marlboro Man. Snickering laughs and intelligent dialogue are plentiful in this well-paced film. It's a satire that skillfully walks a fine line, ultimately providing satisfaction to those on both sides of this hot button issue.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.8) Thank You For Smoking (2005)- Aaron Eckhart/Cameron Bright/Katie Holmes/William H. Macy/Katie Winslow/Robert Duvall/Rob Lowe/Adam Brody/Sam Elliott/Maria Bello/David Koechner/Joan Lunden/Dennis Miller
0393072231|5.0|This is an excellent account of the recent financial meltdown.  There are no real heroes in this book.  Read it for a better understanding of what happened, why it happened, and an appreciation for the rot that lies at the core of our financial markets.  Bernie Madoff was small potatoes compared to Lehmann Brothers, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and their enablers like the clueless bond rating companies.

B003HARV3Y|4.0|I saw the previews for this movie while watching another movie, and thought the books might be worth the read. I read the whole series in about a week, they were that good! I had encouraged my oldest daughter, 9, to read them, but she has just started the Warrior series, and wasn't interested, but did want to see the movie. I took her and my 7 year old. I was very disappointed that it differed so much from the books, but tried to look at it as a totally separate thing. Neither of my daughters had read the books, but they really loved the movie. Looking at it as just a movie, it was a good, fun adventure. And after seeing the movie, both girls were interested in reading the books, which is always a positive. It has become part of our bedtime routine, for me to read one chapter out loud to them both. We're now on the 4th book, and they are loving it. My oldest daughter also takes each book when we're done, and re-reads it. Even knowing the differences in the books vs. movie, she still wants to watch the movie again. It IS a good movie, it's just completely different from the first book. I do hope if they make a second film, they will find a way to incorporate more of Riordian's words into it and make it more true to the series.
0316069906|2.0|Whilst Jonathan Safran Foer clearly is passionate about the message he wants to convey, I was not particularly impressed by [[ASIN:0316069906 Eating Animals]]. The writing has a rambling quality and I was also left wondering why the autobiographical accounts were included. This didn't add to the argument whatsoever.<br /><br />In my opinion this could have been a much better and more powerful book. I was disappointed.<br /><br />Christine Maingard, Author of 'Think Less Be More:Mental Detox for Everyone'
B000M341QE|4.0|The Departed is definitely worth your time.  The acting is well done and the plot is interesting and suspenseful.  The ending of this movie is shocking and and leaves the you with the same shocked feeling as movie endings such as \\"The Sixth Sense\\" or \\"Mystic River\\".  You will not be disappointed.

Halo Legends is base on those video games for the X-Box and X-Box 360 and other sources in which I love the Halo Video Games for it is the BEST First-person shooter Ever for at least the way the Covenant and the Flood fight back against you when you play it on Legendary. There is 8 stories but I like the last four stories better which are: (1)Odd One Out which is a silly funny with a Dragon Ball flavor, (2)Prototype, (3)The Babysitter and (4)The Package in which I love this story the most for if you are a Fan of the Halo Game Series you will know why. In Halo Legends you get various art forms, Halo history, Sci Fi Star Trek plus Star Wars like battles, violence, love and more. The Flood are mention here and I have to say in the Halo Video Games they scare me more than Michael Jackson's Thriller video.

What makes it more amazing is that this was his first movie and he had zero acting background. Meadows just saw him one day and offered him the part.

0891419063|5.0|This novel is the most humbling literature I have read. Sledge is a simple man telling a remarkable story. This truly is a perfect depiction of what is most certainly the greatest generation. No added details for \\"flash,\\" so while reading this novel you know Sledge based every sentence on his horrific memories. This is a novel every American should read.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I have always loved Cyndi Lauper's voice and her songs from the 80's. She is an artist I have long admired and was anxious to hear how well she would do the blues. I needn't have worried. This CD is INCREDIBLE. There is not one song on it that won't have you dancing, bopping or singing along with. Cyndi's vocals are incredible and she makes you believe the feelings behind the words. I have purchased several CD's this year and by far this is the best one I have bought. This CD will be getting worn out in short order. I highly recommend buying this if you love blues music. You have found another niche for your incredible voice Cyndi...excellent!!!
B001CZVVW8|5.0|Ever since I discovered Met Operas Live in HD I have wanted the opportunity to purchase video recordings of some that I have found exceptional. Eugene Onegin was the first blu-ray I have found and I was delighted to be able to purchase it despite not having seen it in the theater. I thought the casting was well done, each of the principals fit their parts well and the singing was glorious. Other critics have objected to the lack of scenery. As a long-time devotee of studio theater in which the setting is no more than a suggestion, I rather liked the opportunity to imagine the scene.
1591843162|5.0|Another masterpiece by Seth Godin. He has very sharp feeling of nowadays world evolution...   I'm not sure if he knows it, but his ideas is partial compilation of the old wisdom of kabbalah (especially in \\"Tribes\\")

B003FK8V7G|4.0|I had goosebumps when I heard \\"The '59 Sound.\\" And now I got just as many goosebumps when I heard \\"American Slang.\\" The guys are gonna be the 21st Century equivalent of the E Street Band.    These guys should rename themselves the G Street Band, because their two letters better than the E Street Band. (Well, the E Street Band are pretty awesome. But, let's face it: It's Bruce Springsteen's show 100%.)
B00275EHIM|3.0|It should surprise no one that the Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time isn't what one would call cinematic genius. It has a few things going against it. First, it is based off of a video game. It is well chronicled that no movie based off of a video game ever gets beyond \\"fun\\" (and perhaps \\"witty\\")  with its storyline. More often then not the standard reaction is \\"I just wasted two hours that I could have spent contemplating the universe.\\" Second, I start to worry when movies seem so effects driven. I want story. The Prince of Persia manages to more or less wreck its story impact at the end, but keeps a certain level of humor that had me grinning every time I facepalmed.    The writing is so-so, as I mentioned before. It certainly wasn't the worst movie I've seen this year, but the plot was pretty predictable. An orphan is adopted by the king, king's relatives start power grabbing and blame everything on the adopted son. Adopted son tries to clear name and save everyone. Wash, rinse, repeat. Do not use bleach. I can't say that there was all that much to the performances by the main characters except that they were all right, but nothing spectacular. The banter between Dastan and Tamina tended towards the mildly witty, but away from the clever repartee I found the dialog mildly pompous. It wasn't awful, it just seemed a bit stuffy in places. The bad guy was pretty standard and decently acted, but nothing particularly spectacular. I did like that the brothers were unwittingly aiding the big conspiracy against the throne.    And then there's the ending. I loathe any variation of \\"it was only a dream\\" when ending any kind of story. I think it's a lazy cop out that effectively invalidates the narrative and waters down any point that the storyteller was trying to make. I would be considerably more intrigued with this film if it didn't go back to a saved game at the end. The sad end would have worked with the story and the conclusion could have been so much more philosophical than the \\"happily ever after\\" they used.    There are some saving moments to this movie. Sheik Amar was funny every step of the way. I loved his jokes about taxes and how he was unabashedly a conniving clown. I liked the ostrich races too. The first few rewind scenes with the dagger are also pretty funny.    I'd wait for the rental, but it's well worth the effort to sit around with some friends and throw popcorn at. Just be sure to remember to play either \\"Time Warp\\" from Rocky Horror or \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\" by Cher during the ending credits.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|So sad that for all three Twilight movies, the soundtracks are better than the actual movies. I mean, I personally don't know why these movies don't fare well. I've seen them with my girlfriend and I think they're atrocious. The acting is bad, the script is even worse. They've got special effects that look like they were made by little kids. And, I'm surprised the one issue I have the most problems with hasn't been brought to life: The plot is a ripoff of Buffy and Angel, with the sexy Sarah Michelle Gellar and the strapping David Boreanaz replaced with these kids who look like goths and talk in monotone.    I'm so relieved that I can enjoy the music from the movies, at least. And this album has some damn cool artists on it: Metric, Muse, the Bravery, Florence and the Machine, Sia, Fanfarlo, the Black Keys, the Dead Weather, Bat for Lashes, Vampire Weekend, and Band of Horses. They are all flawless. This album is bound to be better than the actual movie. But, hey, \\"Epic Movie\\" is better than all the Twilight movies combined.
B002ZG994U|4.0|I grew up watching the A-Team when I was little. I loved that show. It was fun action candy, the characters were unique and memorable and problems were solved with cleverness and planning. It had Mr. T in it. What more could anyone want?    When it came out on the big screen this year, I knew I had to go see it. I knew that the major moviemakers were resorting to remakes and that most of them weren't particularly good. I was pretty sure that they were going to ramp up the violence, because nothing sells quite like explosions (just look at the horrid Transformers movies). I was hopeful that the actors could do justice to the characters and in such a prepared state of mind, I went to see the film.    The team is accused of stealing counterfeit US dollar printing plates, resulting in the death of a general in the Iraq War. They break out of military prison to prove their innocence. Meanwhile Face's old flame Sosa (who lost rank as a result of the incident) is charged with finding them and the still missing plates. A CIA spook named Lynch is also involved, simultaneously helping and hindering both sides for his own purposes.    The plotline wasn't bad in concept, but I would have liked to have been guessing about the nature of the bad guys more. Almost as soon as the CIA agents entered the scene, they are cast as the foe to outwit. A few things were changed around in prevalent themes. This new version is considerably more gritty than what I remember and there's a lot more violence.The story focuses on planning to a certain extent but it gets sidelined a little into the obligatory romance between Face and Sosa. For the most part the changes weren't all that bad, although I do think that the movie would have been better through the middle if the romantic subplot was cut out. Sosa wanting to find the actual bad guys would have been perfectly fine, but no, any woman in an action flick must also be an object of desire, regardless of what other roles she might carry. *sigh*I need to get something out of the way before I continue too much further. I'm sorry, but however good he may or may not be in the octagon (I don't watch MMA) Quinton Jackson does not approach the level of sheer awesomeness that Mr. T did. This should not be taken as a slight against Mr. Jackson, but merely a note that when the original has an internet meme right up there with Chuck Norris's, you are going to fall short. It was still a decent job with BA's mini character journey from badass to being unable to kill to protector-warrior. I did feel that it was under explored and under utilized (especially when compared with BA's fear of flying).    Liam Neeson tends to do well in just about every role I have ever seen him in and I wasn't disappointed, although I did find myself facepalming at some of the narrative decisions. Bradley Cooper also did a decent job, although I felt that some of his jokes seemed somewhat forced, although that seemed more a product of the writing as opposed to the delivery. Also, his near constant womanizing seemed rather at odds with the pseudo-romantic subplot with Sosa. The flipflop could have worked better, were he not introduced wearing a bathrobe, getting smacked around by a corrupt Mexican policemen and making remarks about the poor Mexican lady (also wearing a bathrobe) in the same scene.    Then there was Sharlto Copley as Murdock. Whoever came up with that idea deserves a payraise and a cookie. I'm sure he was written as a lunatic. What I got was crazy awesome. Every time he showed up, I ended up laughing and really enjoying the chaos of the scene. which I might have otherwise been irritated at or bored by. Both of the psychiatric ward escapes were unique and undeniably funny (one involved 3D glasses). There was a scene involving mixed up fake passports that goes from tense to unexpectedly all right and then to funny. Whenever he had an active part to play in the scene, he made it work for me. I'd even go so far to say that if he wasn't in the movie, I probably would have enjoyed it far less than I did.    If one is looking for a fun, funny, action type movie, I can recommend The A-Team as a good choice.
B0030U1TLQ|4.0|I love the \\"Disintegration\\" album. It's the Cure's best album. The reissue is not as good as the actual album, though. The remix-things and the live versions of the songs of the album don't work for me. But it's worth it to buy.
B0036EH3X4|1.0|Listen, I've been a LOST nut from the airing of the pilot episode.  I wasn't even that hacked at the series finale - although I do contend that you could tack on the 'going into the light' nonsense onto any ensemble show with similar results.  But the sixth season is really a mess and doesn't come anywhere near the quality of the seasons before it.  From the meandering episodes at the temple (where more unresolved mysteries are introduced needlessly) to the muddled origin story of Jacob and the MIB, this season reeks of lazy writing (or is it tired of writing?).<br /><br />In some ways, I like to think that LOST should have ended with season 5.  Nothing would have been resolved and we would have, ala Twin Peaks, a show with questions that would never be answered but at least the viewers would know that the creators didn't WILLFULLY chose to leave them hanging.  As it stands, season 6 answered nothing and added nothing to the preceding five seasons and that is why it ultimately taints the series as a whole.  I think I'll pull a Jack and erase the last season from existence.<br /><br />(Also, I hear they have created a 15 minute short for this DVD that is supposed to answer questions.  I've heard rumors that the writers left everything unanswered so ABC could have a STAR WARS-like cash-cow for 'expanded LOST universe' books and so on.  To anyone who defends this, I would ask them to remember that The Stand didn't need a bunch of short stories to resolve its narrative.)
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The picture quality of the Blu-ray on the 1080P LCD HD is much better than in the movie theater - regular or IMAX 3D.
B003L4FW9G|5.0|The sound quality on these thick slabs of vinyl is unbelievable - a lot of care was put into their creation. It would have been nice to put them inside of plastic sleeves, but that's a small quibble - the grooves are wide, and the music contained therein is almost overwhelming.  My son and I both agreed that it was like hearing the songs again for the first time.
0743270754|5.0|This is one of those books you will pick up and learn so much that you regret that it has to end.  I am not a history buff or a Lincoln fan, but I was so moved by the greatness and character of Lincoln that I wish I read about him before.  His kindness, patience, political skill, ambition, and moral bearings was so impressive that you wonder why we don't study more about him in our schools.<br /><br />There was so much detail and personal information about the man and where he came from, his family, his political career, speeches, his rivals (of course) etc that you become swept into history when reading this book.<br /><br />This was my first book about Lincoln and I definitely recommend it for anyone desiring to learn about one of America's greatest presidents.
B002ZG97RE|1.0|I went to this movie thinking it would be similar to the Bourne movies but was sadly disappointed.  It is a political message movie plain and simple, there really is nothing to it, no action, no drama, nothing... poor acting and that \\"I'm in the action\\" crap with the camera moving and shaking is horrible.
9889979942|4.0|I've been living in the country for 20+ years, so it's no easy task to capture my attention--or hold it--with a \\"China\\" book. But somehow Carter has managed to do so.<br /><br />Maybe it's the smiles: Warm, infectious, genuine.  A positively ancient yet bubbly Beijing couple on the eve of their 55th wedding anniversary. The Yao woman whose front teeth checked out long ago. Or an adorable Uighur girl with a dainty, coffee-colored lace headdress.<br /><br />Carter documents the astounding variety of the peoples of China, face by face, but he also does a good job of contrasting architecture in different regions. My favorites:  The myriad flat rooftops of Tibet's second city, Shigatse; perfectly circular \\"tulou\\" communal houses of the Hakka in Fujian; and a sea of sloping roof tiles rippling over Lijiang, Yunnan, perhaps China's best-preserved traditional village.<br /><br />Just one page of text precedes each of the 33 chapters introducing a municipality, province or autonomous region. Brief, to the point, but not formulaic.  Zhejiang is encapsulated by an ancient poem, Qinghai via the words of a 10-year-old Tibetan girl who is worried that her family's nomadic life is doomed, and the humorous text referring to expatriates in the capital, \\"China's unofficial 57th minority group.\\"<br /><br />By no means is it all exotic headdresses, ancient architecture and winning smiles; this is not your standard coffee-book tome. Carter doesn't flinch as he profiles victims of industrial accidents, fire and mental illness, some reduced to begging for a living.  But, curiously, even they seem to retain a bit of dignity as seen through his eyes.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|The Lunar Industries corporation has given the world cheap energy thanks to a helium-3 mining operation on the far side of the Moon. Helium-3 is mined by massive automated harvesters and freighted back to Earth. The operation is controlled by a single moonbase, Sarang. To keep costs down, the base is manned by only one man at a time, helped by the base's artificial intelligence, GERTY.    Sam Bell is nearing the end of his three-year stint on the Moon and is looking forward to returning home to his wife and daughter when he starts experiencing odd hallucinations and mood swings. Whilst driving out to repair a harvester, he is involved in an accident. Recovering back at the base, Bell is confused by the way GERTY is treating him, and the lengths the AI is taking to ensure he doesn't leave the base...    Moon is the directorial debut by Duncan Jones, an old-school SF film very much in the vein of late 1970s/early 1980s movies such as Silent Running, Alien and Outland, including a very small cast, a strong visual look and some superb model work, with very little CGI present in the film at all. An absolutely brilliant Sam Rockwell is the only actor with significant screen time, although the Kevin Spacey-voided GERTY has a reasonable amount to do as well.    Moon has a strong theme of isolation. Bell is alone on the dark side of the Moon, without even Earth on the horizon to look up to. The communications satellite is broken, meaning that communications with Earth are long, pain-staking and tedious. The fact that Bell is starting to hallucinate and see things is understandable given his sense of loneliness, but, as with all good SF movies, we are asked if there is something more to his visions than just good old insanity. Moon rewards at least two viewings, as the director expertly sets up some clues as to what is going on before the big revelation (which interestingly isn't a last-minute twist, but happens fairly early on with the rest of the story dedicated to exploring it in greater depth).    The movie poses some interesting questions on duality, our sense of self, and what defines a person. In this regard it is the best SF novel that Christopher Priest never wrote. The atmosphere is taut and claustrophobic, with occasional moments of black humour that work well. Jones uses the viewers' likely experience of previous SF films against them: is GERTY a positive and helpful AI, or is he cracking up like HAL? Jones also knows when to play a trope straight, when to invert it and when to send it up quite nicely.    The only negative that comes immediately to mind is that the end of the film is a little bit too neat (although still very satisfying) and there are one or two elements left under-developed (such as Bell's family back home). But otherwise, this is a fine, intelligent, atmospheric and at times unsettling SF movie.    Moon (****½) is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).
B0029LX2LC|5.0|See, this is a perfect example of why I still love hiphop music.  With all the mainstream garbage they have been playing on the radio and MTV for the past decade or more, The Roots have always stayed humble and have made good quality music since I first heard \\"Do You Want More??!!??!\\" in 1995. When first playing this album which I woke up early the day of its release to be first to pick it up, as soon as the intro started, I was instantly zoned into it, its kind of hard to describe, but almost like it took me to another mindstate. As I got further into the album, there was no urge to skip to the next track, I just let it play through until it started over again with my head nodding the whole time.  Some notable cameo's with Phonte of Little Brother, John Legend, Joanna Newsom, and my personal favorite new up and coming artist Blu, who was a great addition to this album. Me being a hiphop connoisseur it makes me feel good when hearing something like this because this is what hiphop music is all about, a positive message, live instruments, uniqueness and creativity. Oh yeah, and who doesnt love ?uestlove?! A few years ago, i had the privilege of seeing them live with Lupe Fiasco and Erykah Badu at a small venue in Dallas TX and it was a night i'll never forget. Just seeing ?uestlove's hair alone was worth the $25 ticket price.  If you ever get a chance to see them you MUST!!!! Oh yeah and get the album too!
B003A4IFGY|3.0|I'm a little surprised at the number of 5-star reviews of \\"Mojo\\", and that's coming from someone who's been a hardcore Tom Petty fan for 21 years. Seriously, I'm not exaggerating when I say hardcore: my license plate at one time was \\"FRE FALN\\". TPATH has provided the soundtrack for most of my adult life, but that doesn't mean I'm going to drink the Kool-Aid and pretend \\"Mojo\\" is anything special. As a handful of people here have already stated, roughly half of the tracks are dull and/or mind-numbingly repetitive.     The band claims that \\"Mojo\\" is the music that's close to their hearts, the stuff they play when they're hanging out. And so, reviewers automatically buy into this concept and call the album \\"honest\\". That's great for TPATH, but the fans could provide a little honesty themselves. I was \\"honestly\\" inspired and energized by Full Moon Fever, Into The Great Wide Open, Wildflowers, and more recently Highway Companion (a phenomenal album). Just because Petty 'n friends are getting back to their roots that doesn't mean it translates to enjoyable music for the fan base. In my view the uninspired \\"Mojo\\" doesn't even really begin until \\"The Trip To Pirate's Cove\\", but here's my quick rundown of each track:    Jefferson Jericho Blues: 1/5. Painfully repetitive. A throwaway track. I put in on perma-skip after one or two plays.  First Flash of Freedom: 2/5. A long, dull song that I tried hard to like. It never happened.  Running Man's Bible: 2/5. An excruciatingly long, dull, wandering song that never manages to be catchy or inspiring.  The Trip to Pirate's Cove: 4/5. Finally a good, atmospheric tune. Benmont and Campbell especially shine on this one.  Candy: 2/5. Again, repetition to a mind-numbing degree. We've heard this boilerplate song before by a dozen different artists. And no, I don't find anything inspiring about your thoughts on Coca Cola, Tom.  No Reason To Cry: 4/5. A solid, bittersweet tune that reminds me of the material on \\"Echo\\".  I Should Have KnownIt: 4/5. The one genuinely rockin' tune on the album. Sadly, it serves as a reminder of what Petty used to be, not what he is today.  U.S. 41: 3/5.  This one's kinda catchy but Petty really shows his age in straining to make it interesting.  Takin' My Time: 1/5. Repetitive garbage.  Let Yourself Go: 1/5. A repetitive, uninspired melody. (seeing a pattern here?)  Don't Pull Me Over: 4/5. This song is getting trashed in a few reviews for its reggae-esque hook, but surprisingly it's one of the tunes I've really grown to like. I don't see it as pure reggae, as it's got just enough intervention from Petty and Campbell to make it an enhanced form of reggae.  Lover's Touch: 2/5. Some mild hints of the spirit of \\"Breakdown\\", except its vastly inferior in every conceivable way.  High In The Morning: 2/5. Dull and, yes, repetitive.  Something Good Coming: 5/5. My favorite song on the album. A dreamy, thoughtful, soothing melody that I've had on repeat play for days.  Good Enough: 4/5. A solid \\"finale\\" song that rightly puts Campbell front and center.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg was made after Michael Shaara, the author, passed away.  He was not there to see his novel Killer Angel's made into this award winning movie.  Jeff Daniels was so realistic as Joshua Chamberlain, you felt like you knew him and felt the weight of his decisions, the heat and humidity of the day, the dispair when his soldiers were killed, and his joy when they had a victory.  I understand some of the movie was actually made on sight, so they felt what the soldiers did back in July of 1863.  So realistic.  This is a long movie, but you almost wish it continued when it was over.  This movie and book made a visit to Gettysburg a goal for me which was attained this summer, and yes it was hot and humid.  I would love to go back July 1-4th just to be there, but life intrudes, and work takes prioirity.  If you get a chance-get this movie- it really is a classic.  All you history teachers, this is a must for you.  Your students will like this movie, it gives them an idea of what life was like, and shows the war from both sides.

I don't care if the monkeys sang these songs the results would be the same (sort of) but u get my point. I really can't remember a double album being this good front to back and in between. I also like the way the songs run together like it's really just one long song. Forget about the band itself, they're good but these songs are absolutely incredible. I always thought this was the most underated album of all time, infact i don't even know anyone who ownes this album and my friends don't like it either when i play it, go figure. MASTERPIECE!!!!!!

B002ZCDR88|5.0|Some fans of Natalie Merchant's earlier music (with 10,000 Maniacs and as a solo artist) have complained that \\"Leave Your Sleep\\" is very different from her other work. It is, but it has the same uncompromising artistic vision that she's always had. I think that if you're truly a fan of someone's music, as I am with Natalie Merchant's, you should accept or at least be patient and open-minded when that artist explores new aspects of their art--as long as it's of high quality, of course. \\"Leave Your Sleep\\" is of very high quality, especially as a combination of excellent music and words. The variety of musical genres is impressive, as are Merchant's voice and the literary sources that she chose to provide lyrics for her compositions. The 80-page hard-bound book(let) that is included with the two-CD version of \\"Leave Your Sleep\\" is also something to be treasured, both visually and because of the fascinating biographical details about well-known and obscure (but talented) authors.     This was truly a labour of love for Merchant. I'm glad she worked so hard at it!

0446563048|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's partly a memoir of Tony Hsieh's life to this point, partly a history of Zappos and the business decisions behind its success, and partly a guide to achieving a happier life. I was impressed at Hsieh's dedication and willingness to take risks for the sake of his business. He could have just as easily ended up broke instead of becoming a multi-millionaire, and there are surely tons of entrepreneurs who have taken similar risks and failed.<br /><br />Although a fun and enlightening read overall, I can't give the book five stars because in some places it just seems like a jumble of third-party contributions that detract from the underlying message of the book. The selection of different fonts for different types of narrative do help the reader keep everything straight, but they also accentuate the overall lack of direction in some areas.

B003PGNBO8|5.0|ABC has done it again!  On October 6, 2009 ABC began the superior, complex, cerebral storyline \\"FlashForward\\", then totally trashed this fantastic series with discontinuous plot lines and a sporadic broadcast schedule.  The season/series end-er left you with that \\"Will they ever get off the island\\" feeling.  Whether that applies to \\"FlashForward\\", \\"Lost\\" or \\"Gilligans Island\\", all cause you to invest a lot of time for an incomplete story.  At least with \\"Day Break\\", the story had closure but still left two 'outs' for possible continuation.<br /><br />It appears that on May 27, 2010, \\"FlashForward\\" blacked out for good....<br /><br />or has it?????
B0036EH3U2|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best sci-fi ever... this includes Star Wars, Star Trek and yeah all those Stargate series which I don't really watch.   I love the story.  Who knows, we might actually be descendants from another world.  Oh by the way, I love Firefly too but I put this show ahead.    I bought the new complete boxed blu-ray version even though it was more expensive but worth it.  It includes everything from the 2003 Miniseries, All Episodes plus The Razor and The Plan.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Legally Blonde is a good classical comedy movie. It's nothing derogatory in the movie at all. It's not a raucous comedy. I think that \\"Legally Blonde\\" was directed and produced very well. I can watch the movie lots of times and laugh just the same.
0307594777|3.0|If I were to have read the Girl-Who trilogy while being completely unaware of all the media hype and public accolades, would I say that these books are good? Yes. Are they masterpieces? No. Would I recommend them to my fellow readers? Yes. Would I recommend them to my fellow writers? No.     All three books contain moments of magnificent originality and creativity. The multiple storylines offer unpredictable yet completely believable turns of events, the scope of which reaches a near-epic level. Yet, taken as a whole, the books fall far short of what qualifies them as magnum opus of their genre.     The books' biggest flaw, if I may be allowed to point out, is the sheer amount of material that has virtually no bearing on the storylines themselves. Each book goes to great and painstaking length on passages of events that are of no or little consequence or relevance. Granted, every work of fiction has extraneous parts that can be cut and won't affect the plot, but they are only kept in to *enhance* the story. In the case of the Girl-Who trilogy, they simply *overwhelm* it. They inflate and, in the process, dilute the main premises of the books. It is as if these books never had the benefit of a book editor.     It is said here, and I swear by it, that the three books can easily be condensed into one book, albeit a long one. It is further stated that the trilogy never should have been published in its present form. Sounds outrageous, even blasphemous, I know, given the world-renowned status they have achieved. Nonetheless, the quality of a book cannot be judged by the number of copies it sells. The Girl-Who trilogy *is* a phenomenal achievement by a rookie novelist, albeit a dead one, but it contains way too many flaws and errors to merit a five-star rating. Or four, for that matter.
1416550550|5.0|This is the story of interconnected lives, tangled by mystery.  We first meet a very young girl who apparently stowed away on a ship from England to Australia in the early 1900's. She is adopted into the dockmaster's family and renamed Nell, left only with a book of fairytales. We meet Nell's granddaughter, Cassandra, who was raised by Nell. Cassandra begins investigating her grandmother's past after she is willed a cottage in England. We also see the story of the family who owned the estate where the cottage lies and learn of the maze and garden. As the story progresses we learn more about how these stories fit together and the disperate lives of the wealthy and the fallen characters and their secrets. I loved the homage to The Secret Garden and the cameo by Frances Hodgson Burnett.. The Authoress character was particularly well done and I almost wish that I could read her fairy tale collection. While the ending could be surmised before the book was concluded, the story was well done and very enjoyable.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|My review won't break down the story bit by bit because if you made it this far and don't watch season 6, then I don't think I can help.      The reviews here are all over the place and people love it or hate it.  Why?      Because we, as a species, are lost.  The entire show is a metaphor for life itself.  It's not going to answer questions about life and death, good and evil, love and hate because as in life, so is it in the imagination and the show.      I'm going to buy this when it arrives and watch all of them back to back over the shortest possible period that I can.  I'm sure to wonder why this or that happened the way it did, or wonder why this person was left out of the ending; however, it's fine by me. EDIT: Mostly fine.  I took away a star from my review after some discussion within.  While I'll still certainly buy the season and watch it again, I'm still open to removing more stars.       If you are willing to sit back and enjoy a thought provoking series and happen to be here reading this review after dropping the series for some reason, I offer this:  Buy the rest and invest the time with an open mind.  Let it spur your own thoughts about life and what it has to offer before and after it ends.    Want something else to nuke your brain while you wait for the release date?

It's remastered and prime kiss rockin' fun.<br />Some might complain that they just wanted the newer show and already had the other discs but you can always sell those off and keep this boxset instead.  The best buy set did not have the  songs on it but I went back and they gave me a replacement disc that year. Of course thesedays you don't have to worry about that anymore.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I'd have to put this album up with the Slim Shady LP. The Album is just sick. His flow is so heavy and Em seems to have more energy than ever. Just listening to the words he's saying is interesting enough to keep you listenin to the songs, oh yeah and his words have meaning. The album really shocked me on an emotional level, of course noone in the mainstream has seen this side of Em. At the moment I can't stop listening to it. If I'm not listening to it, I got the songs running through my head. If you dont happen to pick up the whole album, at least pick up these: \\"No Love\\" \\"Going Through Changes\\" \\"Talking to Myself\\" \\"Cold Wind Blows\\" \\"Almost Famous\\" \\"Space Bound\\" \\"Love The Way You Lie\\" \\"25 to Life\\" \\"Your Never Over\\" But I strongly advise you to pick up the whole thing. Its epic!
0618526412|5.0|Characters - oh the characters.  With remarkable acumen for her age and life experience, McCullers paints 3 dimensional portraits of wide ranging individuals - and yet ties them to a specific time and place.  The narrative is fine, but the players make this an incredible work.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|This was extremely true to the book ( the book is filled with even more detailed gruesome descriptions, as if conditions could get worse than presented in the movie!) and showcases the talents of two of the most accomplished character actors of the 20th century. A very young Dustin Hoffman and Steve Mc Queen are paired for an action based true story of life in the WORST notorious prison ever to exist in the civilized world.  French Guiana, also known as DEVIL'S ISLAND, housed criminals from 1852 to 1951 with the conditions literally unchanged throughout that time span.     \\"Pappillion\\" french for butterfly, was given this nickname for his large tattoo of one.  He was incarcerated for the alleged murder of a pimp and spent from 1931-1944 in and out of this horrific prison, 2 years of it in solitary confinement (aptly nicknamed \\"the devourer of men\\"). It depicts a slice of man's unbelievable capacity for cruelty to one another      This movie is the moving and incredible story of Pappillion's many attempts to escape and the people who aided and thwarted his attempts. If you liked \\"Les Miserable\\", \\"The Birdman of Alcatraz\\", \\"The Rock\\" and \\"Midnight Express\\" this is the movie for you.  If you have ever spent ANY TIME CONFINED in a jail, restrained , or detained by the law for any reason, you would benefit from seeing this movie. It is inspiring on a mental, physical and especially emotionally level.  At times, heartbreaking, and humorous it is ultimately a story of man's triumph over adversity. See the movie (read the book!) it is entertaining for it's level of acting and it's adventurous and twisting plot as well as it's riveting exotic scenic locations. Surprise ending!!!

0684833395|1.0|This was my second attempt to read Catch-22 all the way through (last year I gave up after 40 pages).<br /><br />Reading this book was a chore, and it took about three weeks and every ounce of discipline I could muster to complete it.  The thick cast of characters were exhausting to follow, the repetitive running gags were tedious, and the circuitous \\"narrative\\" was just irritating.  The humor struck me as dated and corny, with few exceptions.<br /><br />I agree with other commenters who have said that a condensed version of the book would have been more successful.  Its core \\"message\\" was clear and the concept of a \\"Catch-22\\" clever, but after 450 pages of being hit over the head with it...(come to think of it, being hit over the head would have been less painful than the long journey to chapter 42...)<br /><br />Like others, I also thought the ending was a bit too \\"suspend your disbelief\\" but by the time I got there, I was no longer invested in the outcome.<br /><br />To be fair, I did smile at a few passages, and certainly respect Heller's distinct style and abilities as a writer.  Having never written a book myself, I admire his accomplishment, especially considering that it's become a part of the American vernacular and is widely regarded as a modern classic (and enjoyed my many, many people).<br /><br />It just wasn't my bag, and I'll probably never read another Heller book.
0385474547|3.0|I have just finished reading, after some effort to stay with it, Chinua Achebe's acclaimed 1959 novel Things Fall Apart, reputedly the most widely read African novel. Which is too bad, as it fails to achieve what apparently drove Achebe to write it: the desire to bring to life the ample humanity of tribal Nigerians at the time of British colonization. He did a much better job of it in his 1964 novel Arrow of God.<br /><br />However, I cut Achebe some slack for Things Fall Apart, a training novel, as I see it, his first, when his craft was apparently still underdeveloped. Much of the important action of the novel comes in summary, that is, in his telling the reader what happens instead of developing full-blown scenes that put us there so we can see it, feel it and share in the emotion, as with the crucial accidental killing of a clansman by Okonkwo.<br /><br />Most of the tribal characters remained unrealized and largely undistinguishable, serving as mere foils for Okonkwo, as with his three wives. Further, the novel fails structurally, there being not so much a plot with causality and reflective inevitability as chronological (largely) occurrences, often unrelated. Further, his seriously flawed protagonist Okonkwo is a hard one to love.<br /><br />These weaknesses in craft and concept together undermine Achebe's purpose: to show his Nigerian ancestors as vital human beings deserving of our empathy. I found Okonkwo's ultimate downfall unmoving--less so even than Achebe's essays and lectures collected in The Education of a British-Protected Child (2009).<br /><br />Those essays, albeit uneven, work to effectively remind us of the continuing horrors visited on Africa by slavery, colonialism and their aftermath. That said, Achebe misses the mark on his criticism of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, failing to distinguish the narrator Marlowe's observations from Conrad's, for one. But his overall posit about the distorted European narrative re Africa, which he documents, seems substantially on target.t.

B0015DROBO|5.0|'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' has earned heaps of praise.  How can a book with such a silly title be any good?  I decided to find out for myself.  I feared that I was about to read some rubbish targeted to young teens.  Wrong.  The book is very mature, complex and extremely well written.  What a shock!<br /><br />In this book we have two main characters: an investigative financial journalist (male, 40s), and an extremely enigmatic researcher (female, 20s).  Both become entangled in two different adventures: solving the disappearance of a young woman over forty years ago, and bringing down a billionaire who earned his money through underhanded means.  Sounds strange, but the author keeps the reader totally absorbed in both these adventures, which sometimes become interwoven, seemingly without effort.  Oh, and both adventures are concluded very satisfactorily by the end of the book.<br /><br />Stieg Larrson really shines best in delivering great characterizations.  In addition to the leading characters there are several very interesting supporting characters.  The author's attention to detail is very admirable.  And I found the Swedish setting to be very different from the usual mysteries pumped out by American authors.<br /><br />Bottom line: one of the best books I've read in a while.  A must read.

0670021652|2.0|First of all let me start by saying that this was definitely not what I had expected. This was my first Elizabeth Gilbert book, & I didn't read it because of EPL, I read it because (I thought) I was interested in the subject matter. Ms. Gilbert didn't seem so much skeptical of marriage as an institution as she seemed afraid of controversy, though. Throughout the entire book, she kept referring to her past marriage, which ended in divorce. I can't help thinking she would not consider herself a \\"marriage skeptic\\" were it not for this experience. Plenty of people are \\"happily\\" married, though, & are still skeptics. Plenty of people have never been married & are also skeptics. Plenty of people, including me, are skeptical of marriage not because they are afraid of the controversy, the fighting, the disagreements, but because they are skeptical of the what marriage symbolizes & implies for the individual self. I'm a twenty-something year old woman, and I've been skeptical of marriage nearly my entire life. I wasn't, though, unsure of how to make a marriage work (i.e., how to avoid controversy or infidelity, as Ms. Gilbert seems to have been). I was more skeptical of how being married would affect my sense of self - that is, what it meant to effectively lose my sense of independence by spending the duration of my life with one person, merging our identities through rituals such as shared bank accounts and a common last name.    I expected Ms. Gilbert's concerns to be similar to mine. I expected a book by a woman in her late thirties who questioned whether she wanted to be committed to another person at this point in her life, whether she truly wanted to lose a part of herself, embracing a new identity as a wife. I thought this book would have stories and anencdotes that would change my mind about what it means to be a wife - stories from happily and unhappily married women, stories of the struggles women face when it comes to playing the role of doting wife. So maybe my dislike of this book stems not from the fact that this is a poorly written story, but from the fact that it simply wasn't what I had expected.     Aside from that, I took issue with the fact that Ms. Gilbert presented everything in the book as unquestionable truth. Near the middle of the book, she discusses fidelity as though it is a simple, formulaic principle that is easily maintained by essentially keeping personal feelings from men who are not one's spouse & telling them instead only to your husband or other family. \\"Does all this sound excruciatingly obvious to everybody else? Because it was not excruciatingly obvious to me,\\" she states. I don't know about obvious, but it DOES sound excruciatingly simple.     I've been married for two years to a man who I dated for four years prior to our marriage (obviously, I've become a bit less cynical when it comes to marriage). I don't claim to be an expert - our marriage is always changing & I'm always adapting to new situations & emotions. But I do know one thing. There is no secret formula one can follow to achieve marital bliss, as the author seems to imply. While reading this book (which, honestly, I could not finish), I kept waiting for something I could relate to, something that might help me understand my own feelings of marriage. Instead, I was stuck with this poorly written drivel that sounds as naive as it does vague. Everything is reduced to such silly, simple terms that I found myself laughing at some points. Not reccomended for readers looking for any profound revelations about marriage.
030726999X|5.0|This book is by far the best of the three.  It nicely winds everything up, but with adventures galore.  A must read if you have read the other two.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I have to liken 'Shutter Island' to another mystery-thriller: 'The Sixth Sense'. Both have a myriad of clues planted throughout the narrative, leading to a highly entertaining twist ending. I'll confess that I was pretty much fooled up until the climax but I did have my suspicions that things couldn't be what they seemed. At first, it seems that 'Shutter Island' is going to be a tale about some evil psychiatrists (aided and abetted by a corrupt staff) who are conducting secret experiments on a hapless population of psychiatric patients. Dr. Cawley (perfectly played by Ben Kingsley) does everything he can to stymie Federal Marshall Teddy Daniel's investigation including his refusal to hand over staff personnel folders. Before you know it, there are rumors that lobotomies are being performed at the lighthouse, on a different part of the island.<br /><br />I became quite confused after the hurricane when Teddy and his partner Chuck (later revealed to be psychiatrist, Dr. Sheehan) are so easily able to walk into Ward C, where the most dangerous patients are housed. After all, if this was where all the really bad things were happening, wouldn't Cawley and his guards make it a point to prevent Teddy from learning Ward C's dark secrets? My best reasoning held that the marshals were able to slip into the off-limits area due to the confusion in the aftermath of the storm. But it didn't look right; the guards supposedly knew who Teddy was and they were simply letting him casually walk into the house of horrors where he does in fact learn that patients are being mistreated (i.e. lobotomized).<br /><br />Was this simply an example of poor screen writing or was something more sinister afoot? As it turns out, Teddy's beliefs that everyone was out to get him on Shutter Island, was simply a paranoid fantasy. In fact, Teddy's 'investigation' was simply an elaborate role-play set up by Dr. Cawley, designed to break down Teddy's defenses. The ubiquitous Rachel Solando, who supposedly murdered her three children, was one of Dr. Cawley's staff members, pretending that she was a murderer in order to help Teddy realize that it was actually he who had murdered his wife after discovering that she had murdered their three children.<br /><br />Because all of this calls for a great suspension of disbelief, Shutter Island ranks up there as a solid piece of film entertainment but holds it back from being considered a true 'artistic masterpiece' (as some have argued it is). There are three big problems with the film's narrative.<br /><br />Firstly, there's a big assumption here that such role-playing could ever lead to such a huge improvement in a paranoid schizophrenic's psyche. Cawley and Sheehan concede that the role-playing can lead to a regression (as it did with Teddy nine months earlier, as they candidly admit). They call it a new \\"experimental therapy\\" but role-playing has been around for centuries. It looks awful nice how they get Teddy to confront his demons, but I would think that role-playing (as it's shown here) would tend to aggravate the patient, much more than it would lead to any kind of meaningful revelations.<br /><br />That leads to the second problem: why would the Board of Overseers countenance such a therapy? After all, those are the guys who approve the lobotomies at the slightest hint of violence amongst the mentally ill population. Back in 1954, lobotomies were actually believed to be helpful for patients. Why would such do-gooders, such as Cawley and Sheehan, be given the chance to turn Teddy around? Not only don't I believe such people would be in charge of a Federal lock-up for the criminally insane but even if they were, they would not be allowed to conduct such a role-play experiment.<br /><br />In reality such an experiment would place both the staff and the prison population in jeopardy. In a ridiculous scene, after Teddy bursts into the lighthouse, Cawley asks him, 'did you hurt the guard very badly?' In real life, he would never have been allowed to put any of the guards in jeopardy. Just imagine if Teddy actually had killed the guard by slugging him over the head with the rifle? And would Dr. Cawley allow his expensive European convertible to go up in smoke just to help the most dangerous patient on Stutter Island--simply out of the goodness of his heart?. I know he's a liberal but no one's that liberal when it comes to their own property that's worth so much money.<br /><br />So without the role-play taking place, there's no twist ending and no accolades for Dennis Lehane, the author of the novel along with Director Martin Scorsese. Nonetheless, there's much to admire about this picture. Scorsese has a terrific way with camera angles. I love all the subtle closeups such as when the Dachau Commandant reaches for his gun, as he lays wounded in his office along with the old Victrola, with the record playing over and over. Scorsese sometimes overdoes things, especially with those scenes involving the murdered children at the end of the film (just a little too much blood for my tastes). All the performances are quite good here including Kingsley (as noted earlier) along with a very cool Max Von Sydow (who at first glance is supposed to be the bad guy but on second viewing, is quite benign).<br /><br />Scorsese also smartly added the ambiguous line at the end suggesting that Teddy is cured but pretends to be insane since he can no longer live with the guilt of failing to save his children at the hands of his murderous wife.<br /><br />This is the type of picture worth watching twice. The first time around you'll be in the dark; the second time you'll watch it for all the clues missed. But after that, there are no profound ideas here to sift through. In other words, an Ingmar Bergman film it ain't! But as a solid entertainment--it hits the mark!ever have been allowed to put any of the guards in jeopardy.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|Hadn't gotten a Smashing Pumpkins CD for a long time.  Was very pleased with this one.  A bit different than their other releases, but I enjoyed it just as much.  I would recommend this.  A little harder edged than some of their previous but actually sounds good!  Enjoy this one.  Curious about their newest.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|\\"Scream\\" is undoubtedly Ozzy Osbourne's best collection of songs since \\"No More Tears\\" back in 1991.  Sure, there were some good songs on \\"Ozzmosis\\" and \\"Down to Earth\\", but there are also several fillers on those discs as well.   \\"Scream\\" starts off with a track called \\"Let It Die\\" which I would describe as musically adventurous.  Towards the middle of the tune listeners are treated to a jam that sounds sort of like \\"Children of the Grave\\".  The single \\"Let Me Hear You Scream\\" is a silly song, but a fun one.  Other tracks, \\"I Want It More\\", \\"Life Won't Wait\\", \\"Diggin' Me Down\\", hell, all of them are a musically feast to be enjoyed.  I think a lot of credit goes to new guitarist Gus G., who adds a freshness to this release.  No, this CD isn't perfect, but it's a never boring like the last Ozzy album.  I would call this one, \\"good fun\\".
B002JCSWV6|4.0|From my wife Sarah: I'm really glad I saw this movie. I learned so much, and was just simply amazed (not even a strong enough word) and blown away with the man, Nelson Mandela. This movie showed beautifully what he was up against trying to bring together a torn country full of hate and bitterness. It looked impossible, but he never lost heart.<br /><br />What was so magnificently shown was the incredible forgiveness that Mandela gave. The movie showed him as a true leader and role model for everyone. It effectively showed what he suffered and lost, and how he was willing to fight if absolutely necessary. But it also showed how he looked for a way through peace whenever it was possible (and when it looked impossible to others). He did all this despite what people thought of him. Even his own family. His amazing ability as a visionary, diplomat and peacemaker was shown so well. I was so blown away by this man that I couldn't stop thinking about it. I ended up doing some research on him to learn more.<br /><br />I gave the movie 4 stars because there are long segments that were quite dull. When the soccer games were shown, they were difficult to follow, and very dull. Even my husband who is a huge sports fan couldn't follow and got really bored. Since these scenes take up a significant portion of the film I felt I needed to take that into account in my rating.<br /><br />Regardless, this movie is a real eye opener, and so valuable. It's so worth seeing for everyone.
B003PNHW3W|4.0|This is the self-titled debut EP by How to Destroy Angels, a group formed by Trent Reznor, his wife Mariqueen Maandig, and producer Atticus Ross. It sort of sounds like Nine Inch Nails release The Slip if a woman was singing. It will be released physically early next month, but you can still download it online for free if you want. So yeah, it's pretty enjoyable electronic/industrial stuff, and it's hard to go wrong when you don't have to pay. My two favorite tracks happen to be the opener and closer, \\"The Space in Between\\" and \\"A Drowning\\". The former has a perfect, ominous sound countered by Mariqueen's pleasant voice that nicely introduces you to their style, and the latter has a nice build up and release for the record's climax. The other tracks are totally fine too, with my third favorite probably being \\"The Believers\\". I'm not sure how dedicated any of them really are to the future of this project, but their first effort is fairly strong and might be worth some further development.

I really hope the makers of the 2 disc world movies continue to add to their credentials as I will be first in line to buy the newest ones.

My son really enjoys this book and I cannot say enough on how great it is.  He enjoys the pictures and coos every time I read it to him.  Mem Fox's poetic rhythm is perfect with the  A/B/C/B scheme and I can tell that my family will enjoy it for years to come - my husband has even gotten into the book himself and likes to hear me read it to our darling boy :)

B003NHRIVQ|3.0|Well, I had high expectations because I loved the novel.  The development of the characters was weak in many areas.  The pastor plays a major role in the novel and is given very little credibility in the movie.  The father's and brother's characters were well done, all things considered.  I think they should have chosen someone else besides Miley Cyrus for the main character role.  I just don't think she is silver screen material.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|GREEN ZONE is not a great movie, but is a courageous one that boldly steps in front of the audience with some truths that are sobering: WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) never existed, despite their being the rationale for our declaring war on Hussein's Iraq.  What novelist Rajiv Chandrasekran (\\"Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone\\") from which the movie is adapted, screenwriter Brian Helgeland (LA Confidential, Mystic River, Taking of Pelham 123) and director Paul Greengrass (the Bourne series of suspense thrillers, United 93, etc) have elected to show us is a moment in time in the fighting in Iraq when one man has the courage to go against the press (current journalism having stooped to an all time low in erroneously informing the public that Bush's concept of WMD was true and stood their ground in Iraq to continue the myth) and the military to seek out the truth from those Iraqis whose words in Washington DC had been ignored.<br /><br />Chief Miller (Matt Damon) is the resolute hero of the story and his commitment to uncover the truth about WMD is the line of action the movie takes. The 'mouth' of the lies about WMD is in the person of journalist Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) and the dodgy perpetrator of the nose of the press is Wall Street Journalist Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan).  There is a man - one Martin Brown (Brendan Gleason) - who knows the truth, and it is his encouragement to uncover that truth that engages the quiet but driven Miller to finish the mission.  The idea is to find General Al Rawi (Yigal Naor), the man who in Washington DC told the higher ups that there were no WMD and whose words were twisted to suit the blind ambition of the US Military and Bush, and allow him to tell the truth.  Miller's main assist comes from a simple Iraqi citizen 'Freddy' (Khalid Abdalla) who guides Miller beacuse of Freddy's ambition to save his country.  Tying the action of Miler's confrontation with Al Rawi with the concurrent video clips of Bush aboard the USS Lincoln announcing to the world that the WMD had been found and destroyed and that the US was victorious in the war makes for movie journalism statement at its best.<br /><br />There are problems with the film: the unrelenting noise and sequences of fighting without pauses for reflection make the film forget to slip in characterization details that would have helped the story; the musical score by John Powell just doesn't match the action; the rapid edits and the fact that most of the film is an extended nocturnal chase become wearing.  But the quality of acting from even the most  minor characters is strong and the message of the film is a thunderbolt of information we all need to consider.

B003JSU2NU|4.0|It took me a few listens before I liked the CD.  However, once I saw the movie and could put the music to the scene, then I liked it alot more.  Now I have some absolutely favorite tracks.
031606792X|1.0|Admittedly, I came to this book series late.  On a whim I watched \\"Twilight\\" on Showtime 2 weeks ago and got hooked.  I devoured the first 3 books greedily in that time and have enjoyed giving myself over to the story's large elements:  obsession, love, sex, desire, friendship, and 2 great male characters (Bella's character is one of the Worst female protagonists Ever in literture.  Her constant self put-downs were downright enraging, but I digress.)    And then...this book.  It is such a monstrosity I am instructing my husband to either 1) burn it in the fire this weekend when he goes camping or 2) leave it deep in the woods to never be found again.  It goes against my own personal code to defile a book in this way, but I cannot express how strongly repulsed I am by the very knowledge that this book exists.    I have read the other reviews posted here and agree with their reasoning, but it's not even the way in which Meyer seems to go against her \\"own rules\\" that bothers me.  It's not even the handful of large syntax errors like her use of the word \\"burrito'ed\\" or \\"whichever'ed\\" that even had Me snorting.    It was that this book had no Heart, no Feeling, no poignancy, no insight, no connection AT ALL to the characters and why we loved them.  It seemed to me that Meyer was on a quest, from the very first word of this book, to simply steamroll through the story and get to the finish.    She left elements dangling that bothered me.  Giving Bella the ability to smell blood (\\"it smells like rust and salt\\")...and then not doing anything with that ???  When authors leave things dangling, we as the reader expect it to go somewhere meaningful.  It has been utterly ingrained in all the english and lit classes we sat through in school to look for things like that in writing, and have an expectation on its follow-through.  Also, what was the point in her being so clumsy??  Where was she taking that??  Only to completely change that large aspect of Bella when she becomes the most utterly suave and coordinated vampire Ever.  yes, thanks for that.    But the biggest part of why this book is so horrible is how Meyer betrays the trust in us as readers.  It seems to me that when an author commits to writing a series they take on a huge task of earning the implicit trust of the readers.  For me to fully commit I want to know that she is taking the story somewhere good, somewhere great, to a fitting and yes, maybe even painful ending, but one that Foremost rings true to the characters and the velocity the story line is running.  Anything could be handled, ...death of a main character, agony of making a sacrificial choice...as long as in the end, you knew it Had to happen that way for the good of the story.    This books fails in every single one of those areas.  She has left me utterly anguished the way in which she decimated every single main character and turned them into hollow shells, somehow managing to elevate Bella, the worst and weakest link in that chain.  She ruined Edward's pure love and devotion.  She seemed to degrade Jacob's loyalty and friendship and make it seem like idiocy instead.  She never advanced the characters of the Cullens, an utter shame because they became beloved characters.  She made Charlie sniveling and clueless.    And I never liked the imprinting idea, and feel now it was just an element she introduced to give this story line a wrapped-up ending so every single character was happy and got what they wanted.  Ugh.  It felt sickening to read about Jacob's love and devotion towards a toddler, and glad I wasn't the only one who felt that way.  Creepy.    My only hope in not despising Meyer as a writer is if she one day finishes and releases Midnight Sun, which at only halfway finished, already has the potential to be my most favorite book ever.  She owes us that much after this travesty.

B0009A21R6|5.0|Played on my OPPO BDP-83 SE, Nuforce Edition, [[ASIN:B003N9NE12 OPPO BDP-83SE - Nuforce Edition]] I listened to it on my high quality stereo, with my jaw dropped and my eyes wide with excitement. This is the music we know, yet like we've never heard before; the improvement is so outstanding. A whole new experience of the same songs, only remastered to quality better than possible for consumers, back in the day.  The sounds from guitar have all the character, twang and original Dire Straits sound you could dream of. It must be heard to understand. Imported from England, but worth every penny.     In \\"So Far Away\\", during the chorus, the low growling guitar notes are heard to advantage, and similarly at the end of lines, such as following \\"blister on your little finger\\". Throughout, the percussion is tightened up in the remaster, weigh in the lows, fast and crisp for cymbals. \\"Money for Nothing\\" is the album version, at 8 minutes, 26 seconds. The percussion in the intro to Money for Nothing\\" is heard to particular good effect, with the ethereal \\"I want my, I want my MTV ...\\" lead in. The price of this Hybrid SACD album is not \\"money for nothing\\"; the money is for a fine improvement/remaster of particularly high quality.     There are CD stereo, SACD stereo, SACD multichannel tracks. I didn't listen multichannel as I only have stereo gear, although my OPPO did down-mix the 5.1 audio track as stereo. Even playing it as an ordinary CD on a nice, older Sony CD player, it was nicely improved. The musical upgrade of this disc is not as fine when the CD layer is played, compared to SACD, but it is still no small improvement in my opinion. Particularly recommended for those with quality music setups, especially played as SACD, both stereo and surely also as multichannel, although the multi-channel assessment is based only on the quality experienced in stereo. It's made me feel like a kid again, only with better toys and music. Listening as SACD, I wanted to listen all the waythrough, the music drew me in so. Listening as a CD, was more like in the old days, where, after the great songs, one might be motivated to jump to the next great song rather than just listen. High quality, reasonably priced, audio equipment can show the audio improvement to good effect. \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula Baby What I Say ... do the walk of life\\", to great music.

Some of the songs sound like 60's pop and mid life Byrds to my ears.<br />  Saw Bruce 2 times on tour last year in Denver and St.Louis, great shows both. We were<br />going to the Kansas City show, but it cancelled due to the death of Lenny Sullivan.

1401323820|1.0|The folks at ABC decided to hire a ghost writer to write an actually novel based on the \\"research\\" done on the TV show.<br /><br />However, I think they might have given the ghost writer a pretty small budget as the book isn't that good - as far as mystery novels go that is... In fact, instead of being a cool new mystery, \\"Heat Wave\\" is just another episode of Castle - only in book form instead of on TV.<br /><br />Which, considering I happen to like the show, is not necessary a bad thing. It just wasn't what I was expecting - that's all.

031237593X|5.0|For me, this book affirms that history is written by the winners, and may not be necessarily completely accurate. It was in Henry VII's best interest to malign Richard III, and he certainly did an excellent job, considering what we were all taught in school. I appreciate that there are people who care enough to try to set the record straight.    The Wars between the Yorks and Lancasters are tragic. They all knew each other, grew up together, were related to each other (however distantly), and ruthless ambition, alliances and betrayals destroyed many of them.     I don't have a strong knowledge of the time period, and at first, I found the ever-changing alliances, naming conventions and character references a bit confusing (I got my Georges mixed up, once), but I quickly learned. It helped me to have the abbreviated family tree and the map in the front of the book, as well.    I appreciated the author's notes at the end, contemplating motive and opportunity, and the historical record of what happened to some of these people is heartbreaking.    I'm glad I read this book, and I know I'll read it again.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Recently, I've avoided vampire movies and television shows like the plague because of Twilight. My friends introduced me to this show a few days ago, and it is very addicting and got a lot better as it went along. You begin to care for the characters, such as Sookie Stackhouse, Bill Compton, Sam Merlotte, Tara Thornton,  Lafayette Reynolds, and many other characters. In the small town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, a waitress with telepathic abilities named Sookie slowly begins to fall in love with a vampire named Bill. All her friends are against their relationship. Someone in the town of Bon Temps is killing women who have slept with vampires. I highly recommend TRUE BLOOD: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON!!!
B003AMAOW4|1.0|I apologize for that what follows being also my reply to a previous reviewer. I wanted to be able to grade the performance as well.  He gave it 4 stars so my one star averages to a more reasonable 2.5, still way too high in my opinion.<br /><br />I don't have to see the actual production to have seen and heard the worst. This is very plainly one of the most egregious, perverted, fraudulent examples of \\"Regietheater\\" (\\"producer opera\\") that I have yet encountered. The producers should be sued for false advertising. This is NOT the Lohengrin that Wagner wrote, but a sick figment of the producer's twisted imagination. It doesn't matter how good the singing, playing or conducting is - this is a DVD, not a CD, and so not in the least a legitimate performance of the composer's opera. Avoid producer trash like this like the Plague if you want to understand and appreciate this beautiful work.<br /><br />Wagner was in exile in Switzerland when he finished the work, and he had to get his good friend Franz Liszt to stage it, I believe in Dresden. He loved it dearly, pleading with Liszt to use his influence to do so. This dvd abortion is a slap in the face to the composer and every present and potential Wagner lover.<br /><br />Fortunately there are a number of alternative dvd's available of this work.  Go to Amazon & read the reviews  - best way to expose phony art like the above.  Sometimes you can't even trust the album cover to give you a true representation of the staging.  Or check out several Netflix dvd's if they're available.  That way you won't be stuck with trash.
B001NXDSLG|5.0|I bought this on a gold box deal for a great price and enjoy both the added footage and the extra performances made it worth the purchase. There are probably 20 additional songs included. I particularly enjoyed CCR as I had never seen footage of them performing. The quality of the footage is pretty amazing given it's age.     On the other hand, I could have done without all the cute extras - ticket replicas and other trinkets. While I appreciate the thought, I'm becoming space challenged with my DVD,CD and Blu Ray collection and this boxed set takes up room of at least 5 standard DVDs. Perhaps not a fair criticism, but I didn't deduct any stars for this. As far as I can tell, the blu ray version is only available with these extras.

B003KUSUG8|4.0|So far from what I heard this Cd sounds interesting and outside of the realm of Eminem but that was just hearing the sample offerings. I did chuckle at the opening songs lyrics, typical Slim Shady mixed in there showing he still has that edge that makes you hear it and look around to make sure you aren't offending anyone. :) I really do think that people who liked this will love his last couple of CDs as well Relapse and before that ReUp mixes. Reup in one of my favorite Eminem CDs and Relapse had some awesome songs as well. I think Eminem fans will love Reup, its a damn good CD to toss in the CD player in the car and cruise on high. Peace...
B000H6SXMY|2.0|***IMPORTANT***  If your friends complete series did not come with the booklet, it is very likely that you got a fake one.

The colors were faded, the dvds were packed in little plastic bags and it was missing all the extras that the set comes with.    BE AWARE WHEN BUYING THESE. SOME SELLERS MIGHT BE SELLING FAKE ONES.

B003D513TQ|2.0|This is a delightful and accurate historical drama/romance that, unfortunately, has a vague beginning and a non-existent ending. The actors (especially Jonathan Firth as Albert) are flawless, the sets and costumes are magnificent and the direction is superb. Sadly, accuracy and beauty were substituted for plot. Humans don't LIVE lives with a beginning, a middle and an end - things that are essential to a good movie. In this amazingly accurate portrayal of V&A's love story, they forgot that they were actually making a movie. If you want a study in how to present real people in an utterly realistic way hundreds of years after their deaths, this is your movie. If you want a story, a plot, a movie, you will be better served by other, less-accurate films.

I love the heavy menacing sound, the beat, and Ozzy's voice. This is not Ozzy best effort, but for me it's better than anything else I've heard lately.  I have been an Ozzy Fan for about 40 years. I remember hearing the first Black Sabbath album and was just blown away by their sound. To those who say Ozzy doesn't have a strong rock voice, I want to say \\"Really!\\" To me Ozzy has probably the most definitive rock voice of anyone. As teenagers, me and my friends loved how \\"tough\\" his voice sounded. I understand people being fans of Zakk Wylde, I am too, but if I had my way he would have never left Tony Iommi, so we would have missed out on Randy Rhoads, Zakk, and many others. I think Ozzy has earned the right to pick out his own guitarist, he has done an excellent job over the years.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|I haven't been much of a fan of Eminem since The Eminem Show, and even that CD was starting to get into a kind of lackluster territory.  His best work IMO was The Marshall Mathers LP, followed by The Slim Shady LP, and then The Eminem Show.  Everything after that is extremley sub-par.  I can't stand 50 Cent, or G-Unit for that matter, so the Shady Records/G-Unit Mixtapes and collaborations were trash too me as well.  Then Encore and Relapse hit, and I really felt like Em might have just fallen off too much, and would never get the chance to be ranked up there with the top 3 greatest emcees of all time...until I heard Recovery.    This cd is nothing short of AMAZING.  His flows actually ride the beats differently, and PERFECTLY, to each song.  His lyrics are INSANE, both in content and in the way he rhymes his syllables, but it never gets too far into the absurdity of say The Slim Shady LP's material.  He switches up with a number of differnt flows, pulling inspiration from the likes of even Bone Thugs n Harmony and Twista.     All I can realy say is buy this CD, support Eminem's comeback to the top, and recognize him for the truly talented artist he is.  BUY RECOVERY TODAY!

B00006LPER|5.0|DivaHerHighness wonders why everybody is speaking French in a film that takes place in Vienna. I'll take a stab at it. It's true that director Michael Haneke is Austrian, but my guess is the best actors in European cinema today are French. Isabelle Huppert is one of the best and she proves it by portraying the complex role of the piano teacher. Watch her commentary that is included with this film, which is in English. She explains that the theme of the movie is that the piano teacher is afraid of being hurt. She wants love but not seduction and thus wants to control the relationship with her student. I would bet that she speaks good German, but wouldn't you rather hear her speak French?<br /><br />This is my fourth Haneke film: three are in French and one is in German. Regardless of the language, they are all complex, intelligent films. I note some of the comments made by reviewers here: \\"twisted cinema\\", \\"a very unsettling world\\", \\"provocative perversions\\", \\"beyond weirdness\\", \\"holy crap\\" and much more. Sure, there is some nudity and unusual sexual behavior here. I would recommend that you not show it to your young children, but let's be adult here.<br /><br />Did anyone notice the beautiful music in this film, most notably Schubert's next to last piano sonata in A major D.959 and Schubert's piano trio in E flat D.929, which is also a recurring theme in Stanley Kubrick's great film Barry Lyndon.

B003HLM2QO|2.0|First of all I have been following Ozzy most of my life and appreciate his music. This disc rates lowest of all his releases. Nothing new here. I was expecting some different licks from the new band personel but sounds like any other talented shredder, drummer, bassist. I also can do without the vocal overdub with ozzy's growl. It was new on Black Rain but just sort of redundant again. The songs don't have anything new to say or inspire me to turn up the volume. This sounds like it was put out to satify the record company. I bet the new guitarist can pull off every one of Ozzys previous guitarist's licks in concert. Where are you Bob Daisley? Ozzy needs you back...

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers is a wonderful addition to your game shelf. The basis of playing revolves around economics; you gather and use five resources to build your settlements faster than the other players. This is quantified by \\"Victory Points\\" you accumulate by building cities, roads, and amassing an army, among other things.    The best part about this game is how free the players are when it comes to trading resources. This leads to a lot of politics and some backstabbing, which is really fun and unpredictable. Each game is randomized, so no two games will be alike.     Setup is easy and the game pieces are made of wood, a welcome rarity in the plastic gaming era. The only limiting factor is its narrow margin of number of players required. You need at least three or the game is too easy. Four gives players the best challenge but you won't be breaking out this game during parties unless you buy the 5-6 player expansion.     Settlers is a great game, and every circle of friends should have a copy.

193413712X|3.0|George Washington Crosby lays on his deathbed, hallucinating and partially reliving the life he has known.  Most of his thoughts drift back to his childhood and his father, Howard.  Howard was a door to door salesman pulling a car with a mule into the backwoods.  Without giving too much of the plot away, if this book could be said to have a plot, George's relationship with his father was both close and distant, and ultimately tragic.  George also thinks about his own life as a handyman of sorts, but mostly a fixer of clocks.  And thus the book meanders from one thought to the next as George slowly but inexorably expires. It's at times a soft detailed excursion into the minutiae of a life, and at others a hard bitten look into the pleasures and travails, and ultimately heartbreaking childhood.    This novel is certainly poignant and well written but I am not sure it rises to the level of Pulitzer Prize winner.  A short, enjoyable, and wonderfully descriptive novel, with a well rounded central character at death's door is the best way to describe it.  It is definitely worth a read, but is somewhat overrated.
B002ZG997C|5.0|I see the movie an allegory to our times and lives, or as a matter a fact that of any time. We don't need a nuclear war to have the end of times. We also are challenged to carry that same book, THE BIBLE throughout the end of our days in the same manner as Eli. To walk in faith but not in sight. Every day we \\"battle\\" and \\"fight\\" evil and temptation of sin just as Eli fought his adversaries in the movie. In time, can we also say what Eli said at the end of the movie?<br /><br />Okay, after this movie there should be no more post-apocalyptic movies. End of the world movies are so worn out and out played.<br /><br />This movie wasn't perfect (outdated Hollywood brutal violence which could have been depicted in classical ways) but I give it 5 stars for going where others fear or won't.
0515141429|2.0|Killing Floor gets 2 stars from me simply because I managed to make it the whole way through.<br /><br />I have to say - I'm glad this wasn't my first Reacher book - because I wouldn't have picked up another.  It's clear that Jack Reacher's character was in early development with this first book.  The utter fawning over Roscoe. . . the speed (a week) at which their relationship progressed to a level where they couldn't stand being apart for a couple days. . . the dancing and jumping around by the dumpster. . . these are just samples of many instances where the early Reacher didn't align with the Reacher from later books.  I found this Reacher quite difficult to stomach.<br /><br />And the plot holes!  One of the worst was a near psychic conclusion that Reacher came to when time was of the essence and he had to find someone quickly. . . .  He called hotel after hotel asking for an alias he practically picked out of a hat, with no signs of doubt that he might be even slightly wrong about the name.  And magically, he nailed it.  (It's comically more complex than this, but I don't want to ruin the fun.)<br /><br />There also seemed to be a lot of places in the book where Lee Child hadn't perfected his American voice.  I've only heard of bathroom stalls being called \\"cubicles\\" in the UK, for instance.<br /><br />Finally, I'm sure there are opinions on both sides of this issue - but I've decided that I prefer Reacher stories written in 3rd person.  I actually miss \\"Reacher said nothing.\\"  And frankly, the way Reacher described things in this book often made me wish he'd said nothing.  I'm about to crack the cover on Gone Tomorrow (another first person book) . . . so we'll see if my opinion changes after that.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you're just getting started with Jack Reacher. . . don't read this book first.  The Enemy was where I started. . . and I've read many since then.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Thanks for such fast service; came in good packaging too.  This should be mandatory viewing for everyone in our country.  It will change the way you think about our food chain and McDonalds.  I now think how sad it is that our future children are getting dooped into eating such poor products (that has changed everything down the line for big profits) with enticing toys they beg their parents to buy them.  I told one individual about it and the reply was that what we don't know won't hurt us and I said, this time you're wrong, it will affect you in adverse ways eventually.  Your body reflects what you eat on a daily basis so I will buy organic as much as possible now and when I do eat out, I will be asking a lot more questions along the way.  You will too once you see this important documentary.  Run, don't walk to get it either!
B00005221M|4.0|This movie provides a more accurate account of the revolution and some of the issues taking place in early America, which are often found lacking in other historical dramas.  In addition, it does a nice job of showing the passionate romance between hero and heroine without the sexually explicit details found in most movies today.  Please be aware that this is not an uplifting film or happy film, it is definitely a drama.  In addition, there is a lot of violence in it, so if you are sensitive to violence, this may not be the film for you. However, if you enjoy action and history, it is definitely a movie worth adding to any collection.

B002HFWAXG|4.0|I ask moviemars about this movie.  Amazon says it will be released in Sept, yet, moviemars has it now, why?  They just blew me off without an answer.  I ordered it any way, if it is not a good copy I will send it back.  They do not seem to care about the customer, only the money.  I will probably not order any more movies from these moron? They say it is from the studio, but, if it is so, why does Amazon not have it at this time. I hope it is not   pirate copy?
030745455X|4.0|This informative novel, written in Swedish c. 2004, brings the gothic genre up to date in its characterization of a goth avenger victimized by fallout in Sweden from Germany's invasion of Russia in World War II, the Russian military secret service, the Cold War and the end of the Soviet Union. The story, set mostly in Stockholm, investigates corruption, police procedures, journalism and media, computer hacking, misogyny, gangsters, and Swedish state secrets. The narrative techniques are cinematic and fast moving. The protagonist is original. The translation into English is idiomatic.  The dialogue seems authentic.
B000W4D94I|4.0|This is a fun movie to watch but I could not tell too much difference between standard definition and high on this one. I do not think they spent to much  time on the high definition mastering of this one.

0307454541|2.0|I like the writing. It was very suspensful. But, the end was so disappointing that it ruined the book for me. It was almost like the end of the story was written by anoter author. I don't want to give away the end but it made no sense and was completely out of character for the main characters. I read the second book, and it was better. I am looking forward to the third book.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I rated this album with 5-stars simply because the music industry is producing a lot of mediocre albums. You might have one or two songs (three is pushing it) that you enjoy and the rest of the album sounds weak and thrown together. That is NOT the case here! I do not love every song, but since this album landed in my hands I listen to it everyday. Some of my favorites are: \\"Love Is My Disease,\\" \\"This Bed,\\" \\"Un-thinkable,\\" and \\"Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart.\\" But the whole thing is pretty consistent. I do not think Alicia Keys has the best vocals out there, but she has definitely honed her skills and is a talented artist.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I did not watch this movie!!! It's Jaws... the scariest movie. I bought it for my husband who loves the movie, then to my horror, he let my 7 and 8 year old boys watch it!!!! They loved it, but were forbidden to talk to me about it. If you like scary movies, this is it.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|I've been a long time Sia fan, mesmerized by her ballads \\"Breathe Me\\" and \\"Blow it all Away\\" from her early albums, and wowed by every song on her last masterpiece [[ASIN:B0010DJ1VA Some People Have Real Problems (Dig) (Ocrd)]].  We Are Born succeeds in every way I hoped for, despite having a largely different feel from her past work.<br /><br />It may surprise you, but there aren't really any ballads on this album.  That's not to say Sia has moved on to dance music, the songs here are still chil-laxing, smooth, and a vocal showcase. Instead of putting you to sleep, though, you'll be tapping your toes and inspired by Sia's gorgeous voice and artistic interpretation of pop music.<br /><br />As far as highlights go, I honestly love EVERY song on this CD (Very hard to say these days).  If I was Forced to pick favorites, \\"Big Girl Little Girl\\" \\"Clap Your Hands\\" \\"Stop Trying\\" and \\"You've Changed\\" have been on repeat since I got the album, but I never skip any song.<br /><br />Overall if you're an old-timer Sia fan and are unsure about her new genre, don't worry, she's better than ever and a glorious breath of fresh air compared to the terrible mainstream music of today.  Also, if you've just discovered Sia and would like to hear more stuff by her you HAVE to listen to \\"Breathe Me\\" and \\"Blow it all Away\\" they are the most gorgeous ballads I've ever heard
B0012GMW7A|5.0|For those just becoming aware of Leonard Cohen, this is an excellent choice to start a collection with.  It contains a few of his more popular numbers, and a few surprises that you'll enjoy discovering.      Unlike some of Mr. Cohen's other offerings, this one lacks the rather depressing element for the most part, and is more lively, energetic and rousing.      Without reservation, I'd recommend this album: Various Positions as music you'll play often.  If you like Leonard Cohen's work - this one will make you happy.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Four & a half stars. A well-made and practical backpack for photographers. I agree with the comments that it could hold 2 SLR bodies and several lenses or flashes. The compartments are adjustable. You could remove all the dividers and have one big compartment. As lightweight as this backpack is, I am surprised at how sturdy it is. The front pockets could hold flatter items such as memory cards, photos, maybe a lightweight reflective material. Although it's handsome enough for a plain black backpack, it's not exactly the most chic backpack, so I'm knocking it down 1/2 star. The surface on inside and out is quality. Not the cheap fabric you find in a lot of similar packs. I am uploading a close-up of the sporty tabs and texture. The other pictures posted are true to the backpack, so take a look at those.

0071636080|5.0|Being a lover of theater, I welcome Carmaine Gollo's book with open arms. Instead of chapters, he uses scenes. Instead of bullet points, he shares how to use interesting, simple visuals.<br /><br />John Sculley says, \\"Marketing is really theater. It's like staging a performance.\\"<br /><br />This quote in Scene 1 is worth the price of the book. If we could look at presenting our ideas as theater instead of selling and manipulating, just imagine how much fun we'd have! The first part of the book speaks to the importance of having a sense of purpose, an antagonist (a common villain the audience can turn against) then a conquering hero. If you're looking to inspire change in your audience, this is a good way to set the stage.<br /><br />There are examples throughout the book of Steve Jobs actual speeches and how he incorporates the idea of theater. At the end of each scene, you'll find director's notes to help you incorporate the ideas into your own presentation.<br /><br />Act 3 is about refining and rehearsing your presentation. If you've ever seen Steve Jobs speak, chances are you feel his ease and natural way of communicating. Gallo shares his research where he finds that Steve Job's team spends hundreds of hours on a five-minute demo.  (Hundreds!)<br /><br />You'll read about the use of metaphors like when Steve Jobs says, \\"What a computer is to me is the most remarkable tool that we have ever come up with. It's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds\\"<br /><br />This book will help you craft a message that clearly expresses it in an unforgettable way.  Enjoy!
B002UQN0G8|5.0|My 11 year old son does not like reading for enjoyment, however, once I introduced the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series to him, he was hooked.

Highly recommended.    Meir Charash  Certified Fitness Trainer  Jerusalem, Israel  [..]
B001NLKT60|1.0|I bought this book up by accident, thinking it was the first, because I was intrigued to see what the commotion was about. Far from being a prude, I expect a decent book to demonstrate conscientious moral behavior. However, within the first 50 pages, it was clear that the author neglected to hold his characters to a high moral standing, other than to entice each other and other characters, including a 16 year old, to have sex. I was intrigued with the math equations, and there were some interesting segments, but this book read like a hard-core R flick that I had to toss it aside.<br />Granted, nobody's perfect, but why should we applaud Blomkist or Salander for any heroism when they behave like animals without any redeeming moral character?  Maybe this type of behavior is considered \\"normal\\" in Sweden, I don't know, but it's not standard in the U.S. and I'm frankly surprised and disappointed that this book is selling so phenomonally.  I will not be picking up any other books in the series.

B0038M2AZA|4.0|If you've ever met Temple Grandin, you could see what a fantastic acting performance Claire Danes gives in this movie.  If you close your eyes, you would swear she is the real person!  That being said, the movie left me wanting more.  More about Temple's childhood and her family background.  More about how Temple sees the world, and how the world sees her.  Yes, there is information about how the ranchers didn't want her around, but only because she was a woman!  Temple achieved so much and against great obstacles, so you want to know EVERYTHING about how she did it!  Definitely a movie to buy and watch many times.

0385341008|5.0|There are very few books that have brought me such a pleasant feeling. Warm, smiling, pleasant. In the midst of some very grim incidents, this book manages to be a true delight. Typically, I can't stomach heroines without discernible flaws. But both Miss Ashton and Miss McKenna are so likeable that I couldn't help but, well, like them. Other reviewers are correct- this book is a little too sweet. But I was precisely in the mood for that kind of book, and it delivered in spades. A very easy read (I finished in one day), it is both heart-breaking and heart-warming.<br />I confess, one of the reasons for my high rating of this book is a reaction to something that I greatly dislike in modern literary fiction. So many authors seem to feel the need to have a seriousness and depression in their tone to convey \\"realism\\" that is soon tiresome and dour. But true reality is very rarely all sad or all happy. It is a fluid mixture and it is truly amazing to see the optimism that humanity often musters in the face seemingly intolerable circumstances. \\"Guernsey\\" manages to portray that optimism without crossing into the territory of cliche or over-simplification.<br />In a word, this book is an immensely enjoyable read with interesting things to say- and it adds a much needed shade to the tableau of current literary fiction.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I have enjoyed a lot this book. I'm more used to classic ones, so for me it seem a little bit an unreal story (that's why I rated it 4 stars).<br /><br />But it's a good thriller and keep the tension up to the last page. It doesn't finish with a lot of things open so you can read it and then take a rest before reading the following ones (that is what I'm going to do).<br /><br />So if you are not sure of what to read this book will be a good choice.
0143145088|5.0|I find the thoughts in the book very interesting and compelling.  I'm working on my second time through.  The challenge is how to come up with ways to implement ideas in our company.

B001FB5634|1.0|If you are an ardent fan of this genre, maybe you'll like it.  There is nothing new or different or creative about this film from countless post-apocolypse movies that have gone before.  I must confess I watched only the first half of this movie.  I was falling asleep and couldn't take any more.  It is drab and dull.  The characters spend the daytimes wandering through abandoned buildings in a sort of gray, dismal twilight.  They spend their evenings in firelight or near darkness engaged in endless, meaningless conversations.  There is no action, no adventure, no story, no message, nothing to make this film intersting or entertaining.
0446563048|5.0|Poker winnings and late night raves led Tony Hsieh to head a $928 million tribe (by the time he joined forces with Amazon in 2009).    His book (released today) Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose is the continuation of the movement Tony started more than 10 years ago with Zappos . It is now about far more than shoes - it is about changing the world.    This is not your typical run-of-the mill internet start-up story. Instead, Tony's fledgling shoe company started a revolution. It was (and is) a movement away from the normalcy of corporate governance, the mystery of management curtains , and the leverage of corporate power plays.    In describing his company he said,    \\"I...[made] sure I never lost sight of the value of a tribe where people truly felt connected, and cared about the well-being of one another.\\"    Tony employed business practices that many in his position would have been terrified to do. His transparency with employees and customers, the local paper and the world-wide-web (in a public company blog) was \\"risky,\\" but in perfect alignment with the values of his tribe.    This approach alone challenged the status quo of corporate communications, and fit perfectly into the tribe he was creating; a company and tribal culture where people cared about more than just company profits, they cared about the happiness of each other and recognized the humanity of every person.    Tony isn't a \\"shoe guy,\\" rather he is a people guy, a culture guy, a tribal leader. The culture of Tony's tribe now extends far beyond Zappos \\"employees\\" to include its vendors, applicants, customers, unexpected tourists (yes tourists!), other company's CEOs, Amazon execs, and even me!    Tony is more than a CEO, he's more than a tribal leader; Tony is an ordinary person just like you and me - he challenged the status quo, committed to a tribe, and started a movement. A movement of which even Seth Godin, author of the bestseller Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us, would be proud.    Tribes are what change the world. What tribe will you lead?   [..]
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Every actor in this movie does a good job, including the bit players. The story is fantastic. It shows what a great leader Nelson Mandellah was. It shows the tight rope he had to walk to keep his fellow ANC members from taking out their pound of flesh on those that took particular pleasure in pursecuting the native population. An example of this persecution is with the fairy tale about the first heart transplant donar being a native man(who has the right blood type) and his wife, were found on the beach both dead and not having any other family. That is impossible, this is a tribal society you always have relatives.   The native peoples hated Rugby it represented Apartied to them.   This story shows how Mandellah showed the majority how to forgive the minority in less than a year and used Rugby to do it.

B00377V6IS|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this. Opeth's Blackwater Park album in 5.0 (as it says on the box and on the disc, but it sounds/feels like 5.1 so maybe that's a Europe thing?) is the best thing I've ever heard. Steven Wilson's vocals on \\"Bleak\\" are awesome (well I dont want to give it away if you haven't bought this yet), also \\"The Drapery Falls\\" is something totally worth getting the Legacy Edition to hear. You'll know what I mean. In fact, \\"The Leper Affinity\\" will set the tone as to what to expect quality-wise because there are some things in that one you can't here on even a lossless file from the cd. The making of documentary is a good watch as well.     For all of you concerned in the US about compatibility, don't worry. I live in Chicago, all of the regional coding is right, it's NTSC, etc etc.     If you are viewing this item, you are an Opeth fan, and there is no such thing as a \\"casual\\" Opeth fan, so take my advice and buy one of their best albums in 5.0 (again, it sounds/feels like 5.1 so I'm not sure why it is advertised as 5.0) It's almost as good as hearing it live in its' entirety like I heard on their Evolution XX: An Opeth Anthology tour (amazing show by the way, flew out to NYC for it)
B001FB55L2|1.0|Having a friend who had to work some issues out from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is doing great after love and acceptance from family and friends plus receiving rehabilitation and counseling,  Brothers was a great film. It was a good film throughout the movie but crossed into the stupidly absurd at the point of the Marine Captain bludgeoning to death his fellow Marine. So for that reason alone the Hollywood Movie \\"Brothers\\" goes from a 5-4 Star Movie to a 1.
B003A4IFGY|1.0|I was going to buy this cd since I'm a Petty fan and have all of his other stuff. Instead, I listened to the preview of all the songs on Amazon and some full songs from You Tube.I'm glad I didn't waste ten dollars on this. I thought every snippet of what I heard was horrible. It might sound narrow minded judging an album without even hearing it, but I could tell this music is far from upbeat. Some albums grow on you after a few listens, but I could tell that would never happen here. Every song sounded boring.  Where is the classic sound of &#34;Damn the Torpedoes,&#34;Full Moon Fever,&#34; and &#34;Into the Great Wide Open?&#34; Even his albums that were mediocre had some good or great songs. Don't buy this. It's as bad as Springsteen's &#34;Seeger Sessions,&#34; and &#34;Devils and Dust.&#34;

B000054OXU|2.0|There is much music from the 1980's that I still love - Style Council, Tears For Fears, Pet Shop Boys, MJ, Madonna, Queen, just to name a few. There was also a lot of music that sounded okay at the time but that I now shake my head at and wonder what the hell I was thinking. Landing on Water reminds me of that latter class of music. It sounds totally generic and disposable. In particular, the up front and monotonous drumming is totally distracting. Every damned song is dominated by Steve Jordan's ever present and pedantically awful bang bang bang. It's almost as if the producer had a mixing malfunction. Young's distinctive and affecting voice and the occasional guitar flourish aren't enough to save this record. I didn't particularly care for Neil Young (debut LP), Hawks and Doves or Reactor. But at least these were listenable. With LOW I just want to get up and take the thing off. I bought this album in October, 1986. I did play it, probably just once! I do not recall hearing any of the songs on this record on the radio, in a bar or club, in a friend's house or in concert. You don't have to be a genius to figure out the reason. I own almost thirty of Young's recordings on vinyl and CD. I am a fan - just not of this particular music.

B000DZIGE4|1.0|Yet again we are treated to hollywood's biased opinion of our military. Rednecks, thugs, war pigs, and bloodthirsty criminals. Thats what hollywood wants you to believe your governments army is. Let me tell you from personal experience that the men that serve this country, whether they be marines, sailors, pilots, or regular army, are nothing like the characters in this movie. The shooting war during desert storm lasted all of 24 hours, 22 of those hours being air raids and shock and awe from above. Ground troops encountered mostly surrenduring troops. We are supposed to believe from this movie that desert storm was some sort of quagmire similiar to vietnam only condensed into about 4 hours. There were blatant lies in this movie and they popped up so often that i eventually had to dismiss this movie as accurate and simply look at it as an action flick. First off, drill sergeants in the marines are not allowed to have facial hair yet the one in the movie sports a stylish little pencil one. A drill instructor is tough, there is no denying that, but they never make personal allegations involving a recruits sexuality, nor are they permitted to harrass a single recruit and single them out. Oh and the hitting scene, complete BS. DI's cannot touch recruits. Not even a pat on the back. The branding scene is another myth that was put in the movie so as to show the marines as savages. I have spoken to several marines about this and they say the only \\"initiation\\" they recieved in a barracks was a nod hello. Similiar to Stanley Kubrick's movie, which im starting to think that this is a rip off of that film, Marines in combat are completely clueless and tend to have mental breakdowns not only during combat but during R&R. The marines in this movie have war flashbacks even when they havent been in combat. During battle they are shown as clueless and unable to function. This film is utter trash and a disgrace to our armed forces. Stay away from this one unless you have a strong hankering to be exposed to leftist propoganda.nkering to be exposed to leftist propoganda.
B0036S4CTS|2.0|The concept of this book was great and it got rave reviews so I read it. But it turned out to be completely depressing. I kept waiting for good things to happen but 75% of this book is relating the sad lives of the characters. When there was finally some real romance... it didn't last very long. I was left unsatisfied. This book is not a feel-good love story.
B002ZG997M|5.0|To say that 'The Book of Eli' is a complex film would be somewhat of an understatement. But surprisingly enough, the complexity of the film stems from its simplicity when dealing with the subject matter.<br /><br />The world has been torn apart. The sky has been burned and the earth has been scorched. All true traces of civilization seem nonexistant. Survival is the only law left. Yet, admist it all, a nameless wanderer (we don't actually figure out the character's name until much later in the film) travels west. He is soft-spoken, yet intensely determined, and from the very beginning of the film you can sense an uncompromising nature about him. Tenderness lined with a hard edge.<br /><br />Denzel does an amazing job portraying Eli. He's very believable in everything he does. Also, I'd like to give Mr. Washington an extra nod for doing his own stunts. As far as I could tell, every action sequence that took place was one hundred percent Denzel, which makes what he does just that much richer.<br /><br />Gary Oldman gives a fine performance as well. I genuinely disliked every scene with Carnegie, but not because of Oldman's acting, but because of the character. A slimy, silver-tongued warlord that's used to forcing people to do what he wants. So naturally, every scene in which Eli and Carnegie are at odds, is like watching a battle of iron-hard wills.<br /><br />I will admit that I found the early scenes with Mila Kunis a bit lacking, but as the story unfolded, I found my interest in her character, Solara, growing and by the end I think Mila gave a full and well-rounded performance.<br /><br />Not being quite as experienced with some of the films of a later era (mainly the eighties), this was the first time I had witnessed Jennifer Beals in action. And I have to say, I liked her in this film. I've always had an interest with blind characters and I think she portrayed it well.<br /><br />I also found Ray Stevenson's character interesting as well. He came off to me as a hard man just trying to get by, and is willing to do anything as long as he's still breathing. It was interesting to see the conflict in his character.<br /><br />Now, for everyone worried about the blood/violence/profane language. If you're squeamish towards realistic voilence or just would rather not watch it, this may not be a film for you. I can truthfully tell you that the violence isn't the main focus of the film, but rather a means to express both Denzel's and Oldman's characters. But then again, you may not be able to overlook it.<br /><br />Regarding the profane language: there's a lot of it. If you don't have a TV Guardian or would rather not sit through it, that may become a problem. Now, to be fair, in the context of the movie, Denzel's character Eli never uses profane language. Ever. I think this film does do a good job of portraying how a Christian walking among worldly people may act.<br /><br />And finally, to the religious overtones. I am going to keep this little area open except for some quick advice to help decide whether or not to see the film. If you are open about religious thoughts, beliefs and practices, then by all means, I can't see any reason why you wouldn't see this film. But if you aren't open, and would rather stay away from such things, then do so here. Most of the film is based around those ideas.<br /><br />I personally, really enjoyed the film. I think it gave an interesting take on a post-apocalyptic world that I've not seen before and gave a pretty earnest look at just how savage and civil the human race could be.<br /><br />The Book of Eli: 5/5<br /><br />One last thing to keep in mind: it's only a film. If you're the type that will get offended easily, just remember that. If a film is enough to shake your beliefs as a Christian, then I would spend less time getting angry with the film and use that energy help you build a stronger spiritual foundation.o do anything as long as he's still breathing.

030726999X|5.0|I would have to say, this might be the best of the triology: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was very good, but took me some time to really get into; The Girl Who Played With Fire was even better and had me hooked right away as did the 3rd of the trilogy, which I literally could not put down. I'm sorry Stieg Larsson is gone - no more terrific books. His girlfriend has text for a 4th book on his computer, so maybe in the future??
1400052173|5.0|I am half way through the audio book and I'm quite taken by the many issues that arose from this book:  moral, ethical, medical, scientific, etc.   I am no biologist, just an engineer who \\"retired\\" once I had kids and now homeschool them.  I do plan on buying this book, donating to the Henrietta Lacks Foundation.  Once I get on amazon.com's reviews, the first thing I do is read some of the 1-2 star reviews and the interesting forums.  I really like to see other people's dissensions and why, as they offer new insights, especially in today's society in regards to this book. Quite a few scintillating ideas such as cell lines vs real cancer cell tissues seem to make sense to me even though I may not agree on other points the dissenters have brought up.  En-lighting reading nevertheless.      This book should be required reading for those who study and or work in biology and other life sciences all the way down to high school level.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I wasn't ever a big devo fan.I only knew two of their songs. This is a great delight of an album. Every single song on it is great. It is very upbeat/peppy, with the trademark devo sound effects and very interesting and amusing lyrics. I got lucky taking a chance on this one. It is in my rotation very often now. A  very smart collection of songs that will make you hop and feel good. Congrats to the band for coming up with the right formula for the Devo of today. Just good music, add it to your collection.

006145205X|4.0|Matt Ridley in the Rational Optimist attempts to take a world of pessimism and turn the glass half full. Drawing upon a myriad of ideas this book seeks to look at how prosperity has evolved through empirical, economic and philosophical analysis. It is through these various strengths that a compelling argument is made although one that like many of the arguments against cannot be settled definitively.  By drawing on the philosophies of Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, Darwin and Hayek the author brings forth a case where technological change has been the catalyst to transform poverty into prosperity and while widening the income gap increase the bottom of that gap with it.    Not only in terms of monetary value but human hours gained and energy level consumed has the standard of living been rising around the world.  As to his projections of the future as with all projections they are simply that.  It is worth noting that his arguments against past naysayers of imminent doom do not mean that someday those naysayers will be right but there is simply no way to know. For those looking for a very different well written book this is a great way to go. Occasionally one feels like Ridley is on a rant but overall he keeps on point and is worth taking a look at.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|The first Iron Man film still stands as the best pure superhero movie in my mind. It was like a perfect storm of awesome visuals, great cast, new and old takes on various aspects of the source material, and popcorn fun. Every single aspect of that film just struck me as exactly right. Was I looking forward to the sequel? Don't ask stupid questions. So how does the sequel fare? Read the review title, genius.  Alright, I'm sorry. I'm in a bit of a bad mood because I expected much more than I got. But here's the thing: I actually loved Iron Man 2 on some levels. But I have to face the fact that this movie was only saved by probably the most phenomenal cast I've ever seen onscreen. A well put-together film does not rely entirely on the performances of the cast, but is merely enhanced by them. Aside from the witty dialogue, too much of this production simply did not click. World peace? From one dude in a suit? How? Why? Let's see a movie about that! The likes of Celestial Being and Captain Nemo couldn't do it and their stories are pretty involved. How'd this happen? You expect the audience to buy that the world laid down their arms in response to the appearance of one superhero? Garbage. There is shockingly little action for a sequel to the brilliant origin story of the first film. The sequel's primary draw is the comedy. Most of it is excellent, but some of it is flat-out cheesy because they simply put too much of it out there. Did anybody want to see Tony Stark stumbling drunkenly around in full armor at his birthday party? Did we really want to wait until the final act to see a serious action set piece? Is it too much to ask that Rhodey have a better part to play and his relationship with Tony re-established along the way considering there's a new actor in the role? And for the love of God, I do not EVER want to see Bill O'Reilly's mug on the big screen ever again. Favreau, I'm putting you on notice. You made me throw up in my mouth a little with that one.<br /><br /> The whole production of Iron Man 2 felt unpolished and thrown-together. It BARELY squeaks by as a worthy follow-up because it still kicks the snot out of Spider-Man 3.  Okay, I've ranted and raged about what's wrong with Iron Man 2. What's right? The cast, the cast, THE CAST! Robert Downey Jr is still brilliant as expected. Gwyneth Paltrow's endearingly flustered Pepper Potts is still strong as expected. So what else is new, right? Well, Mickey Rourke. Wow. I was not expecting that amount of coolness from the villain in this one. Rourke plays Ivan Vanko (aka Whiplash) like a Russian Danny Trejo. Covered in tats and scars, grinning sardonically, toothpick hanging out of his mouth, killer accent, and laid back as hell. This man just great to watch. He seems to have popped right out of a Tarantino flick. His benefactor is the compulsively-punchable Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a professional rival of Tony Stark and one cheesy bastard. The guy's mannerisms are so naturally geeky I almost want to cheer for him. But he's such a corny d-bag, I'd rather see him get kicked in the nuts. Either way, a fun little punching bag for the proceedings. I wanted a bigger role for the unnaturally beautiful Scarlett Johansson, but her Black Widow is primarily relegated to eye candy until the final act. Thankfully, I've never seen a more gorgeous character onscreen so the role works on that level. But would it have killed her to put on a hot accent? Natasha Romanov should have a Russian accent as a general rule. Does Samuel L Jackson need an introduction as Nick Fury (psst...he's really just playing himself as usual). All of this goodness kind of leaves Don Cheadle the odd man out, but it's alright. With all the impressive performances onboard there was no way for James Rhodes to stand out from this cast. That is, until he finally gets to rock The War Machine to the utmost. This takes too long to happen. Stupid, crappy pacing.<br /><br />Is that the longest I've ever raved about a cast? I think it is. Well, when we finally get the big action throwdown we've been waiting for it's awesome, but it's over fast. I guess they didn't want to pay ILM any overtime. Boo. But the dialogue and the actors are so strong that these things are surprisingly easy to overlook. I seriously wonder how much of that stuff was improvised because it just seems so completely natural it's hard to believe it was written and performed. That is the highest praise, really. The soundtrack drops plenty of Clash on you along with some James Brown, Queen, Tupac, and of course AC/DC. One could do worse. Not in love with the end credits though. Oh, and if thee hath plans on leaving before the credits are through, I say thee nay! Marvel's got something for you. Seeds are sewn for the upcoming Avengers film along the way including a special part for a certain star-spangled deflection device that the frame-by-framers spotted in the background of the first film. Well played, Mr. Faveau. Well played. The thin story may have been better if it had focused more on Stark working with SHIELD as an anti-terrorism agent and utilized Black Widow as more of a double agent whose allegiance is in doubt. Would have been much more Marvel, much less Hollywood, more action-packed, and even potentially socially relevant. Woulda, coulda, shoulda.<br /><br /> Iron Man 2 clearly fails to live up to the credentials of it's flawless predecessor. In fact, it's almost like a really lengthy and really cool commercial for Marvel's next projects. I expected much, much better from the man who made my favorite superhero movie ever but what I got was better than acceptable all things considered. I didn't leave the theater angry and aside from being assaulted by a raving FOX News lunatic bad-mouthing Miss Potts, nothing about this sequel really made me want to rip the director a new one. If you weren't thrilled by the first film, I wouldn't rush out to by this blind; and to the rest, keep your expectations in check and you should emerge relatively unscathed if not impressed.<br /><br /> 3 1/2 stars, rounded up for visions of Scarlett dancing in my head.s.

B00001W9G0|5.0|I've been collecting some of my all-time favs and this one couldn't be neglected! This is a classic! These are the memorable ones, the best when the couple splits at the end for a worthwhile reason, one that is bigger than they are; one that when they catch sight of each other in years to come that we can feel the longing and the unquestionable love between them. I don't care how many times I watch these classics...I STILL end up with tears dripping off my cheeks!!
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|To be fair, I'm a big fan of the Marvel films (including Spidey 3, Daredevil, Fantastic Fo...anyway). As a Marvel Film and (unofficially) the fourth X-Men film, \\"Origins\\" delves deep into the history of fan favorite, Wolverine, and opens the floor to ideas for similar \\"Origins\\" movies. Treated as its own entity or even as an extension to the film franchise, this movie was a great Summer blockbuster for 2009 and proved its worth to the Marvel library. However, for as great as the action was and how nice it was to see Wolverine's rise to become the mutant that he is, there are a few inconsistencies (I know this because I never read the comics but played the games and watched the TV shows enough that even I could spot a couple):<br /><br />-Fred \\"The Blob\\" Dukes was never a member of Department H; he never worked alongside Wolverine. His allegiance was always to the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants<br /><br />-James and Heather Hudson (the couple whom, true to form, helped Logan in the film) were not old retirees; they were mutants who worked for Alpha Flight (where Wolverine served for a time).<br /><br />-Deadpool was known as the \\"Merc With the Mouth\\" for a reason. Yet, from the moment he becomes Deadpool, his mouth is sewn shut.<br /><br />On a side note (having mentioned members of Department H), was the character of \\"Bradley\\" (the guy who could manipulate electronics) based off a character that Marvel had previously created (I found his character interesting and would like to know). The same question as above applies to the character played by Will. I. Am (the teleporter). It's not really important but their characters interested me and I wondered if they were based off of the comics or were just made for the movie?<br /><br />I digress. These were the comics/television series. \\"...Origins...\\" is Hollywood's take on the lore of another of Marvel's more popular heroes. And, in that regard, respect is given where respect is due. I loved all three of the original X-Men films and my response to \\"...Origins...\\" is no different.is no different.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I've never reviewed anything in my entire life but this Album is that good & gets much love from me & everyone I've played it for! Every single song screams EM IS BACK!!! I DON'T care what the critics say, I've read the reviews (some great others not so great) THIS ALBUM is BANGIN!
B000BI0WOA|5.0|If you love Mark Knopfler, then you are just going to be in guitar heaven on this compilation. In fact, how 'bout I tell you that i'm on my SECOND copy of these Cd's!!! Yeah! I wore out my first one and came back for more.          But, I DO have to admit that I also own almost every single Mark Knopfler Cd that has been made. You can't fit everything onto one compilation! I also will admit that sometimes I just want to hear old school Dire straits, so I recently purchased \\"Dire Straits\\", because you just can't beat that great, original album. Sigh.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|I have always liked Bossa Nova - my first Jazz CD was \\"Getz/Gilberto\\". Most of these songs I am familiar with on the original Portuguese, I've heard them that way for decades. A few of Jobim's songs were translated over the years, but not that many. Portuguese is a wonderfully mellifluous language, someone could read the phone book in Portuguese and it would sound good. Other than the Getz Bossa Nova albums I like \\"Tom and Elis\\". If you look at Samba, it is much more percussive and upbeat whereas Jobim's Bossa Nova lends itself to melancholy treatment by Getz or Sinatra. For what it's worth, Jobim himself preferred these heavily orchestrated versions of his works to to the leaner version on \\"Getz/Gilberto\\", \\"Jazz Samba\\" and \\"Tom and Elis\\".<br /><br />Despite the rave reviews elsewhere, I thought \\"Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim\\" was disappointing, much too short and I had no idea why songs like \\"Baubles, Bangles and Beeds\\", \\"Change Partners\\" and \\"I Concentrate on You\\", non-Jobim song were included when so many of my favorite Jobim songs were missing.<br /><br />Well I found this new \\"Sinatra/Jobim\\" compilation just wonderful. There are a lot more of the missing Jobim songs from that other album but more important there are translations! I don't know if these are real translations, I don't speak Portuguese, sometimes singers just make up new words. But herein Sinatra does his peerless job of presenting the true emotional feelings behind the lyrics. Particularly good are his renderings or translations of \\"Agua de Beber\\", \\"Desafinado\\", \\"Samba de Uma Nota So\\", \\"Wave\\" and \\"Triste\\". Even if the older Sinatra does have a little trouble reaching that last note in \\"Wave\\", what he looses in tonal accuracy, he gains in emotional depth.<br /><br />I love early Sinatra's stuff, I mostly like his Capitol records and pre-fifties treatments, where he poured his soul into the singing. When he was in love with Ava Gardner, when he had the mob make an offer to a Hollywood director that he couldn't refuse to get Sinatra into \\"From Here to Eternity\\" and save his career. Much of his post 1960 Reprise/Rat Pack/Ringa ding ding stuff leaves me cold. But on this two album combo Concord has put together memorable Sinatra with translations of great Jobim songs I've never heard before. \\"Sinatra/Jobim\\" is much more Jobim than \\"Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim\\".<br /><br />Recommendedcouldn't refuse to get Sinatra into \\"From Here to Eternity\\" and save his career.

B0039ZF8D2|4.0|When I first heard about this album, I wasn't too wild about it. I'm a big Nas fan, and I hadn't really heard much from Damian Marley. It ended up surpassing my expectations by a lot though.    First of all, Damian should receive acclaim just for his production. He made a ton of really nice beats for him and Nas to flow over. Nas' lyricism is in top form on this album. Though I would've liked to see him appear more, it seemed he didn't have too many verses. I also really enjoy the message conveyed with the album, it's a positive message about staying loyal to God and also about helping out Africa.    My favorite tracks: 1. In His Own Words  2. Count Your Blessings  3. Africa Must Wake Up

B0000029GA|5.0|I still remember the day I went to the library and looked at this album, saying \\"Hey, I'll try it.\\". I was still new to hip hop, I hadn't heard anything of this album, I just remembered my brother saying he thought I'd like Nas.    This album changed everything I knew about hip hop. I hate to admit, but before I heard Illmatic I was listening to the horrible rap on the radio. It changed me, as I found out what true hip hop was: Incredibly visual lyrics over soulful beats, not talking about hoes and killing people every single line.     Nas' lyrics couldn't be much better. They're the best I've ever heard from any artist. The production is also great, with some really good beats thrown down by Large Professor, Q Tip, LES, Pete Rock, and of course DJ Premier. The only guest appearance, AZ, is one of the best guest verses in hip hop history, with him spitting a fast-paced lyrical mastery verse on Life's a Bitch.    My favorite tracks on the album: 1. The World Is Yours  2. Memory Lane  3. Life's a Bitch  4. It Ain't Hard To Tell  5. One Love    However, every song is classic. This is the only album I've heard that I would consider every single song a classic. That's why it's the best album, in my opinion, ever.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Let me start by saying, I do not think I am hugely overweight, nor do I strive to have an unrealistic stickily thin body. I am 24, 5'2, and about 131lbs.  My problem area is my stomach.  I quit smoking a little over 4 months ago and gained 10 lbs.  Not a huge deal, but my clothes are uncomfortable now.  I think 10 lbs shows more when you are short like me.  Anyway, I am getting married in about 3.5 months and I bought my wedding dress pre-quitting smoking, needless to say I'm a little nervous! I just want to get off the extra lbs without killing myself at the gym.  I hate working out, I hate going to the gym, I hate running, treadmills, anything like that.      I just bought the 30 day shred last night, and decided to give it a try this morning.  I am blown away! I did level one, and I definitely struggled a little! The thing I like most about it is that it's only 20 mins long! So even if you want to just stop, you know you really don't have that much longer! I love that she mixes cardio, strength, and abs all together.. so just when you feel like you definitely want to stop what you're doing, she switches it up!     I really feel hopeful about completing the 30 days, and hopefully seeing a more toned version of myself with a little less tummy.  I have always had a \\"gut\\" even when I was thin, but a little smaller will be nice.    Don't give up guys! I think this video is really good, and best of luck to everyone!!!!!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Quite a few reviews posted here seem to follow along the lines that The Black Keys' latest CD is not as impressive as previous albums, but I've got to say, I simply adore this album.  I have the entire Black Keys discography, and I think every album is full of absolute talent.  While this CD is, admittedly, not nearly as hard as previous CDs, I find that the tracks on it are wonderfully full of blues music.  I just made a mix CD of my favorite tracks from every album, and the bluesy music from Brothers fits perfectly between the more rough and grit-filled songs of previous albums.  Without a doubt, I would suggest that you give this work a listen.
B002IR3PSC|3.0|This DVD seems to me a like big disappointment.    The set list for the MSG concert lacks momentum, focus and the coherence that we have come to expect in a great live recording from any artist or band as ambitious as Jethro Tull . The performance is fragmentary, rushed, and without the precise attention to details that is almost a mandatory value in the music of other great live acts, such as Zappa (Plays Zappa), Gabriel, or Yes.  All the brilliant arrangements from \\"Aqualung\\", \\"Heavy Horses\\" or \\"Thick as a Brick\\" have been compressed in a \\"less demanding\\" heavy-rocking-grey sound that is more characteristic of a \\"little ol' band from Blackpool\\" than from the creators of \\"A Passion Play\\". And even though they were on tour all the time, the music on this DVD sounds everything but effortless or related to experienced musicians: pain, sweat and Ian Anderson's monochromatic voice are in full command of the stage ( although nothing anticipates the HORROR of the years to come: Anderson's infamous throat problem.)      The inclusion of \\"Quatrain\\" and an anonymous jig -two mere fillers- remains a mysterious decision hard to understand when we consider how extensive and varied the Jethro Tull catalog was by the end of the seventies. \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\" or \\"A New Day Yesterday\\" would have been a more predictable but better choice. And if we accept the fact that the image of Ian Anderson approaching the audience with a tambourine in hand during an epic instrumental break is still a memorable scene, then...      ...then we'll do well to remember (and accept the fact) that it's also a very old one: it was first released on a video, for the benefit of a legion of Tullies, some twenty years ago.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|So it seems like everyone else has these huge long reviews. I know when i buy i dont read the long ones, so i'll make a nice short review for you. The x41s are amazing. comfortable. great sound quality. the independent game/chat volumes is definitely a perk. battery life could be better (i use wireless controllers, have cellphone, and several other radio devices in my room, which according to turtlebeach will lower your battery life), but i get an average of 3-4 nights of play per set of AAA batteries (i use energizer rechargables. got a 4 pack with wall charger. works perfect). very light and comfortable to wear. breathable fabric. the only real problem with them is that the sound is soo good that its easy to get lost in the game completely and not hear when someone is trying to get your attention. Absolutely the best headset for a gamer available. WELL worth the money<br /><br />UPDATE 8/28/16: So, 6 years later, these babies have finally died on me. They won't turn off unless you pull the batteries out, they drop connection with the base and cut out randomly, and usually for good for the night (pulling batteries overnight and leaving it like that seems to fix the problem, for a time). For the money, these were/are a solid investment. There are better out there, and I don't know that these are even still available, but they were a great pair of headphones while the lasted.
B0037AGASG|4.0|I was very pleased with my purchase; it arrived within the specified amount of time and was in great condition.

B003KUSUG8|2.0|I LOVED Relapse and thought it was a superb CD.  This one, however, just doesn't do it for me.  First, it doesn't have the catchy beats that Relapse had, has too many R&B undertones and is just overall flat for me. You can even compare this CD to Relapse - it's like two totally different genres.  I think Recover sucks honestly but I will at least give it another listen.  So far, I think there is only one decent song.  I regret wasting the money to be honest.  If you like the tride & true Eminem and want the music he created in the past which made him famous, then you'll be disappointed.
B001UJUGZY|4.0|There is so much right with Possession: Sarah Michelle Gellar is beautiful and affecting as Jess; Lee Pace is (psychologically) dark and sexy as Roman who might be Ryan, and Michael Landes is pitch-perfect as Jess's artistic, sensitive and loving husband, Ryan.  The premise of a woman confronted with the possibility that the spirit of her beloved, comatose husband might now be residing in the body of her dangerous brother-in-law is outright fascinating and could have been mined for so much more than it is, here.  I agree with those who said the alternate ending was better, but even there, Possession suffers from the fact that the directors couldn't decide if they were making a psychological horror film, a supernatural horror film, or a woman-in-danger thriller.  They got that they were making a romance, but apparently became confused as to whether Pace or Landes should be the true object of Gellar's affections.  Ignore the image on the DVD case which has more to do with the direction that the film should have taken than anything remotely related to the film as it was actually made (including deleted scenes and alternate endings). If you are a fan of any of the three actors, you'll want to see this film in which case you should definitely buy the DVD for the more emotionally satisfying alternate ending as the official ending manages to reassert the supernatural theme at the same time it leaves us in a logical and emotional limbo. If you are a fan of the original Korean film, Addicted, you will likely be disappointed in the westernization of a film with a very neat and unexpected twist at the end.  I give this a rating of four primarily for the three leads and the atmosphere and the potential.  Sadly, potential that is not quite realized.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|For over a month I had \\"Heart of Courage\\" open on YouTube, and was saddened that there was no place to download that track and other Two Steps From Hell songs, which are simply EPIC. I was so excited when I discovered that these songs are finally available for purchase! Heartily recommended.

B00000DCZH|2.0|I was mislead when I bought this item, and I want to clarify for anyone else who might be wondering: THIS IS NOT \\"PYSCHO CIRCUS\\". I thought when I ordered it that it was some kind of \\"deluxe\\" or \\"master\\" edition fo the album...it isn't. It has four tracks, \\"Pyscho Circus\\" (Edit and LP), \\"Raise Your Glasses\\", and \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\".  I know the price should've given that away, but at the time of purchase, I was finding 79-cent comic books, so I just figured I got lucky.
B000002Q88|3.0|Up to this point I had owned the Kansas albums Leftoverture, Point Of No Return and Vinyl Confessions, plus a 1 disc compilation.  I had never heard of In The Spirit Of Things and now having listerned to it, I find that the further down the track list I went, the better it got.  Rainmaker is a striking song, T.O. Witcher is an all too short acoustic guitar instrumental and Bells Of Saint James is a sad song of lost love.  I don't see this in the same bracket as the above albums, maybe it misses the violin and Kerry Livgren input, however it's still Kansas!
044656740X|5.0|A MUST READ.  This is a great book for anyone looking to learn how to make your money work for you.  The only downfall is that it is alittle out of date, but its a great starter book.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|Its not often that the sequel to a film is as good as ,if not better than, the first.  But all saints day is one off these.  it just blows you away.  My wife and I watch both films again and again. Just AWESOME .
0307341550|2.0|Right off the bat, let me say that I am confused by everyone's description of the end of this book. I've read multiple posts claiming that this book has a shocker of an ending. NOT SO! I had the murderer pegged as soon as the character was introduced.<br /><br />Secondly, the little sister, Amma, was ridiculous. I thought the character was way over the top and written with such exaggeration that it was hard to take the story seriously. I didn't mind the main character and actually found her interesting but was really let down when she had her go on a drug binge with her little sister. Just ridiculous.<br />The ending was your run of the mill wrap up. It lacked depth and lost itself long before it should have.<br /><br />I would have rated this a one star but there were a couple of interesting aspects to the story.
B00354Y9ZU|3.0|A linchpin is something that is remarkable and irreplaceable. A person working at a company who is a linchpin does their job and then some because they know it is right and what they want to do. Finding people who do this is rare and difficult; which is why they are considered indispensable.<br /><br />Seth begins his book with the reason for writing it. He explains how there aren't any great jobs with real security out there any longer. That the plant style businesses are going extinct and many people who were just cruising through are tooth and nailing it now. He then goes through the chapters in this book that are titled with a way of summarizing them. In the summary at the end he says: \\"I didn't set out to get you to quit your job or to persuade you to become an entrepreneur or merely to change the entire world. All I wanted to do in this book was sell you on being the artist you already are. To make a difference. To stand for something. To get the respect and security you deserve. If I've succeeded, then you know that you have a gift to give, something you can do to change the world (or your part of it) for the better. I hope you'll do that, because we need you.\\"<br /><br />This is a decently written book with many analogies and stories to help you relate what Seth is trying to bring across to you. In almost every chapter there will be a story that you will feel like was written about your own life. This helps in making it relatable. And although he does challenge the reader to be more than they are at work and show their value, it isn't a new line of thinking. It was engaging and had some humorous moments for me, but not original really. Which is why I only gave it 3 stars. Also, another reviewer had written about how Seth mentioned giving without expecting anything in return and how that can add fulfillment to your life. Even how the main people who need to read this to improve their careers are those who are paid little to nothing in their plant jobs working all that they can. So, A) they can't or won't afford a $15 book about a job they know doesn't work for them or B) they won't have or take the time to actually read it. And, I agree.can. So, A) they can't or won't afford a $15 book about a job they know doesn't work for them or B) they won't have or take the time to actually read it. And, I agree.
1439153663|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Kathleen Grissom's The Kitchen House. This epic tale of a girl orphaned on the voyage to America and consequently assigned to duty in a kitchen house of a Virginia plantation was well developed and believable. It delivers a stark perspective of life on a plantation for all residents-the captain, his wife and children, his white employees, and his black slaves. The characters were vividly portrayed, and the plot was engaging and satisfying. Grissom claims she heard the voices of her characters. Clearly, she listened well.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Amazing value.  Quality materials and construction.  Tell everyone you know about Amazon cabling options - $20 less than the cheapest equivalent at Target, and much better quality.  Cabling is the biggest rip-off, and subject of the most dis-information, in electronics.  This is the best deal out there.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|Well acted, enjoyed strong female characters.  Some of the changes from the book were reasonable and even good.  I don't expect a movie to be exactly the same as the original book.  However, one change altered the fundamental meaning in a terrible way--moving this story away from a meaningful fairy tale into a Hollywood picture with a simple happy ending and no heartbreaking sacrifices.  At the end of the movie through who is chosen to be left behind in Hades, the message that a hero/adult has to meet the challenge of living beyond their parent's life potential is lost.
0380730405|5.0|I found the storyline of this book appealing, so I bought it to read. It was my first Du Maurier book. Everything about this book is great. The storyline is so appealing and interesting.  The characters are great.  Even the characters who aren't meant to be likable (e.g. Ms. Danvers) can still be appreciated because Daphne Du Maurier is so good at creating and developing them. I love the dark, mysterious atmosphere this book created from the first page to the last. Du Maurier is also very good at providing a detailed look at the setting so you can imagine it all in your mind like you're really there. I won't give away any of the plot, but it held my interest all the way through and wasn't predictable to me at all. I couldn't put this book down and when I finally finished it, I was sad to be finished.  By the next day, I already wanted to read it all over again, but instead I chose to buy another one of her books (My Cousin Rachel, which is equally as good) and read it. I found myself thinking about this book days after I read it and wishing it had never ended.
B00005221M|1.0|I was SHOCKED by the loss of some of the most memorable moments of this movie. With the exception of George Lucas chopping apart his original Star Wars trilogy, I typically trust director's editions. Imagine my surprise at the removal of character development with certain dialogue excised.    What was Michael Mann thinking???    This actually looked like a TV edit rather than an expanded vision from the director. This is an inferior portrayal of a personal favorite.    How about a version that keeps ALL of it together? The theatrical elements AND the additional footage?    I got this DVD on sale at retail with a free bottle of Coke. At least the Coke lived up to expectations.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|It's amazing for only a small budget, this film still remains the top dog---<br /><br />I do like the early Friday The 13th's, but Halloween will always be my favorite.
B00008K78M|5.0|This is a wonderful video of Laura's 2001 concert in Assago, Milano, Italy.  She is in top form here, performing almost all of her best songs.  The duet of \\"Tra te e il mare\\" with singer/songwriter Biagio Antonacci is truly memorable.    The video and audio production are very good.  The video is 16:9 but is letterbox format, not anamorphic, despite what the cover says.  This doesn't detract too much, but I was hoping to see it enhanced on my widescreen TV.    This is highly recommended for any Laura Pausini fan.
1603420398|5.0|THE BEST BOOK EVER !!!<br /><br />LOVE THE AUTHOR  &lt;3
B0015DROBO|4.0|...you will like this book.  I don't read mysteries at all, but a friend recommended this to me after she read all three of Stieg Larsson's books.  She finally convinced me to pick it up and give it a shot.  The first couple of chapters were slow, and I could not get into it.  I kept putting it down and complaining that it was boring.  Finally I got past the boring intro parts and it got really good.  This book is well written and very detailed; Larsson goes into fine detail about every character and even some background on the situations that the characters are in.  I especially enjoyed seeing Lisbeth's character develop.<br /><br />This novel is Swedish, so there are tons of places and names in here that I don't know how to pronounce.  Most of the time when the author named a place I'd just skip over it and read on.  So unless you're willing to do some geographical research, most of the locations aren't going to make sense to you, either.  I didn't find that this took away from the story at all.  I found myself reading well past my bedtime to finish this.<br /><br />A great summer read.  Not too complicated and heavy, just the right amount of fun.  I'm moving on to the next book!
B001CN2WXM|4.0|I've seen this movie many times and I finally purchased it. Great pic with superb cast. Kim Bassinger is no Katherine Hepburn, but she is so beautiful and so hot. She makes the screen sizzle. I want her so badly. Wishful thinking.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|There are a lot of inspirational movies based on sporting events, but this one is also shows how to lead. If you are in a leadership position, or wish to be, this movie can teach you a lot. Nelson Mandela, after 30 years in prison, leads with class, dignity, compassion, intelligence, fairness, and vision. Watch Mandela then compare him to our recent political leaders in the U.S. with the backstabbing, partisan politics that gets us nowhere. If you want to be in management, coaching, or any position of leadership, watch and learn from this film.
B00102FELM|4.0|Overall great concert.  Klaus' vocals seem a little week here and there, but for how long these guys have been around, they still do great live.  One of the few beefs I have with this is what's with the guy near the end randomly standing on his head, and just leisurely doing some yoga.  It really doesn't add to the concert, I'm just wondering \\"Why is he doing that?\\".  But that aside, it was great!
0307454541|5.0|the beginning was a little slow going but I'm almost to the end. This is a great suspense novel.
3836522845|5.0|The photographs in this book almost seem like slick fashion images until something in them catches you by surprise.  Courtney love in the figure of the Pieta holding the (lookalike) corpse of Kurt Cobain.  With a child playing at her feet.  A row of men wearing boy scout sashes sitting on a log grinning, and at their feet the passed out body of a man with his pants down, a shotgun in his hand, surrounded by beer cans.  What is happening here?  These pictures are fabulous, in the way something in a dream or nightmare is like a fable. Hillary Clinton standing at an executive desk with not one thing out of place, but a half-rotten apple sits on the desk.      What amazes me is that LaChappelle pulls all these people. Courtney Love is really Courtney Love, and Hillary is really Hillary. Kanye West is Kanye West wearing a crown of thorns. I suppose there's no end to celebrity ego so people are willing to volunteer for his photographs, except LaChapelle is obviously skewering these figures.  At the minimum he plays games of irony with their image or their legacy.  He deflates their celebrity 'brand' and really repossesses their faces for his own work.  Justin Timberlake dressed as Elton John.  Pamela Anderson throttling a bloodied Tommy Lee with a big smile on her face, like something out of a slasher flick from the 1970's.     But the book is not all celebrities.  There are spreads of seemingly ordinary people doing what appear to be revoltingly stupid things.  A man with a handgun on his dresser and a baby bottle in his hand is pouring candy liquor in it to give to an already inebriated child.  There is an obvious element of theater to these vignettes, a feeling that you're looking into a shadow box from the imaginary 4th wall.     I had never seen LaChapelle's work before picking up this book. The honest freakishness of his pictures remind me of Diane Arbus. The slick, highly processed magazine feel of them reminds me of Annie Liebovitz. And the humor at the expense ofthe viewer reminds me of Damien Hirst. All in all, this is a book of challenging pictures.  I would not leave on the coffee table for if the family are bringing young children by the house, but older kids will get the celebrity-skewering and consumer-skewering nature of the work quite well.
B003K07DUC|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, although this movie deserves it.. I really didn't know what to expect with the positive and negative reviews practically split in half - but after watching it, I must say it's a winner. It has the imagination of the Bourne movies, with the twist of reality - the imagination comes from the potential corruption inside the US government, and the reality comes from the all to real Iraq war. Damon doesn't play the all out super bad @ss that he does in the Bourne trilogy, although he is the all American good guy standing up for what he is there for and believes in, he actually gets his butt kicked by the bad @ss in one scene..    I'd suggest watching it, the \\"motion sickness\\" is a joke - there is some that adds to the movie, but it's nothing like it was in the Blair Witch project, or that one movie where the GodZilla sized monster takes out Manhattan (can't remember the name of it, and didn't like it much). Also, don't watch it with the idea it's all about politics and what the Iraq war was all about it - remember it's a movie, that's all it is, and remember that the Bourne series was all about portions of the US government being corrupt as well...

B001OQCV2E|4.0|This was a great movie with a wonderful cast and superb acting. I loved it!!!
0143034901|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  The problem with it is that once you start reading you cannot stop.  There is not one wasted word or sentence within the pages.  There was definitely a feeling of sadness as I neared the end.  I loved the characters and descriptions of Barcelona.  I will definitely read Zafon's other novels.  Beautifully written, gorgeous throughout.
076790592X|4.0|Mitch Albom has a peculiar literary talent: He build a narrative that grabs your heartstrings, and doesn't stop tugging until long after the book is over. In its own way, an Albom story is almost like walking through a simulated period of grieving. It's a remarkable thing, and by no means bad. It should be enjoyed for what it is: touching, authentic, and, if not made into a commodity in his fledging popularity, at least it is unique.<br /><br />Tuesdays with Morrie is a non-fiction memoir that focuses on his old professor, a thoroughly lovable man named Morrie. Born to a poor family, Morrie grew up to be an excellent example of humanity, always aspiring to inspire, if you will, even in the throes of Lou Gherig's disease, the same illness which ultimately killed him.<br /><br />You'll pick up Tuesdays with Morrie, and not put it down until you're done. The writing, simple and easy, lends to this effect, as well as the physical typesetting, which tends away from the typical chapter-based serial structure, and into a more flowing  narrative that blends a straight narrative with something like a journal.<br /><br />I recommend this book for everyone. It's good to be reminded that we, as a species, aren't entirely backward, bitter, and broken. Men like Morrie stand against that shadow, and shout, \\"What's wrong with being number two?!\\"
B000002GLT|5.0|John Mayall's albums with American musicians are further jewels in an already well encrusted crown and this is one of the best, neck and neck with that other momentous achievement 'Jazz Blues Fusion'. The songs at this time were vehicles for extended musical exploration in the jazz/blues/boogie vein and when you have musicians of the calibre of Harvey Mandel, 'Sugarcane' Harris and Larry Taylor in the band you know those explorations are going to be smoking. Everyone stars here - 'Sugarcane' Harris's violin wraps everything in a blanket of electric funk whilst Harvey Mandel's snaky guitar lays over the top of the fluid bass work of Larry Taylor. This is a timeless and essential old favourite. If you haven't heard it, give it a spin - I'll be surprised if you aren't seduced by its easy charms and find yourself returning again and again to immerse yourself in its unique sound. Brilliant album.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|[[ASIN:B002CLBJPK Bedknobs and Broomsticks Enchanted Musical Edition]]    This movie doesn't have the modern technology to create the atmosphere. What it does have is talent and storyline that keep it a pleasure to watch.    I see that for the young children of today have a harder time with the movies split between the animated characters and the actors. But as the story plays out they get lost in the colors and music.     For me I saw this when I was young, and shared it with my own children. That was why I purchased 2 of the dvd's recently. One for each of my own children, to share one day with their own children.    Nothing can beat the talent that went into creating this movie can't be beat by today's technology. The song and dance scenes take you right along with the character development.    Check it out if you haven't seen the bed fly, the magically controlled small military stand up against the Nazi's (if I remeber correctly) to defend their small town.     Again Classics can't be beat,content is suitable for all ages.
0471413909|5.0|This book saved my daughter's life, that is not even an exaggeration.   I mean it in a very literal sense, she was very sick until she got on this diet.   Read this Book, arm yourself with a wealth of information.
0446691437|5.0|\\"The War of Art\\" could be subtitled the Book of Common Prayer for Procrastinators (especially writers). It has a permanent place on my nightstand, though it sometimes migrates to my desk and has even accompanied me on vacations and writers' retreats. Steven Pressfield tells it like it is when it comes to the internal battles that take place inside the will and heart of the creative person, and it's obvious that his war stories comes from one who has seen action, and lots of it. The short chapters and no-beating-about-the-bush style make this book an essential and practical shot in the arm (or, more aptly, a kick to another part of the recalcitrant artist's anatomy)to use as needed. I recommend this book to all my coaching clients who are writing books or screenplays, or who find themselves balking at sitting down to any type of creative work. As a writer myself, I find \\"The War of Art\\" still hits home (unfortunately!) after many readings. If you have ever found yourself making excuses or cleaning your baseboards instead of showing up at your desk like a pro, do not procrastinate about buying this book.
030726999X|5.0|As with all his books was good, but you must read the first two first to enjoy fully.
0316017922|5.0|I read this book from a perspective of a parent wanting to give my children the best opportunities for success.  The book gave several insights that were immediately actionable.  1.  Practice time is much more important to success than God-given talent.   - this insight will likely result in accounting for hours of practice for - math, reading, sports, arts, etc.  Apparently, this is the most surefire way to success.  2.  Birthdays matter   - Our son is an August birthday.  We're holding him back.  (We've actually held him back already... but the book made us feel even better about the decision.)  3.  Summer Vacations matter   - Apparently, summer vacations are the academic gap generators between the poor and the wealthy.  How summer vacations are spent very much matters.  4.  Culture matters   - Children will learn from their parents.  It's important to deliberately set a tone in the home for children to absorb.  Is there reading and constantly learning?  Are there entrepreneurial endeavors?  etc.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I had the pleasure of attending this concert as well as owning the 2 disc CD. For my money you can keep most of the live albums that groups put out. Not so with this offering. I am usually disappointed in going to a live concert feeling the sound quality and freedom of ad libbing the lyrics takes away from the songs I have come to enjoy from the studio versions. I can honestly say that Alison Krauss & Union Station sound as good or better in person. At least at this venue anyway. If you don't mind the occasional hoot and holler from the enthusiastic audience, then this is a CD that won't disappoint.
0307266303|5.0|In general, I'm not a big fan of non-fiction.  It takes me a long time to read, and I often put it down in the middle and never go back.  When I received this book as a gift,  I was not excited to read it.  I hate running (though I do it some as part of my regular exercise), and I couldn't think of anything less interesting than reading about a race.  After being asked for weeks if I had read the book, the guilt finally overwhelmed me, and I decided to at least read the first page.  I was hooked instantly.<br /><br />This book is incredibly well-written and engaging.  Every chapter revealed something interesting and exciting about one of the characters, human physiology, human evolution, the marketing of sneakers, the mechanics of running, properr diet, or anthropology.  Every couple of pages, I would find myself laughing out loud or exclaiming with amazement at some new fact I had learned.  I must have read about a quarter of the book outloud to my husband in my desire to share the good parts with him.  It has changed the way I look at running.

B001TH7GT6|5.0|You are getting the same quality of more expensive cables without paying the mark-up that goes with a brand name being stamped on the product. The length of these cables are great, unlike brand name cables that are happy to take a few feet off the length in order to force you to buy longer cables for more money. It's very frustrating when you pay the extra money for cables and realize that you are 4\\" short of reaching your television or DVD player, but you won't have this trouble with these cable and you'll save some money too!

This album reflects her ability to take range to new levels and use her voice in various ways never heard before. This album is described as a unique mix of many genres and styles of music. I hope this album will be just as successful as her previous releases.
B001HN694K|5.0|This movie was full of effects and visuals that really brought Wonderland to life on the screen. Johnny Depp portrays a great version of the Mad Hatter, and the characters are unforgettable. It's a story to inspire the ages and paint a new reality to temporarily escape the ho-hum of normalcy. Love this movie, and have added it to my collection of DVD's to watch again and again.
0800177975|4.0|Like a large percentage of Arnold Schwarzenegger's work, this is a film with a strong fantasy/altered reality element to it that works quite well overall, despite at times seeming too beholden to action formulae, rather than being willing to take the fantastic risks it looks like it's going to.  John McTiernan's 1993 LAST ACTION HERO was roundly criticized at the time of its release for being overblown and not delivering the goods that were expected from a $70-90 million (a lot of money at the time) film.  It came in the wake of TERMINATOR II, a hard act to follow certainly, and also just after McTiernan's financially disappointing MEDICINE MAN - but with his big hit THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER still reasonably fresh.  More importantly, the director had gotten his big break with PREDATOR, which was an important step in Arnold's rise to superstardom; this was their first (and to date only) reteaming.  I suppose expectations were higher than any film could deliver, and when the film failed to ignite either critics or the box office (to be fair, it was always in the mighty shadow of JURASSIC PARK), the word \\"flop\\" started to get bandied about, and the cynics started to wonder of the star's decade of dominance was coming to an end.<br /><br />The naysayers were partly right; this was the first sign of Arnold faltering, though it would take another five years before he really started to lose his lustre; and it wasn't his best film by a long shot, though it certainly looks pretty good now in comparison with some of his later, even more expensive and less successful outings like END OF DAYS.  Basically the idea here is that we start off watching \\"Jack Slater III\\", an Arnold Schwarzenegger cop film in a sort of alternate reality that's pretty close to ours, and then our eventual sidekick character, an adolescent kid named Danny (Austin O'Brien) is revealed as watching the flick in a crumbling and decrepit old NYC movie palace.  The early scenes here are very evocative - Danny is watching the film alone, friends with the old projectionist Nick (Robert Prosky), and his mother (Mercedes Ruehl) worries about him skipping school and only being interested in movies and hanging out with the weird old guy.  Very Zemeckis-Spielberg.  But soon we're in different territory as Nick gives Danny a \\"magic ticket\\" that he got from Houdini himself, tearing it and releasing the magic that allows Danny to be catapulted into the movie world of Jack Slater (now starring in the 4th installment of the franchise, brand-new and not even officially premiered yet).<br /><br />So the \\"real world\\" kid falls in with the completely fake Slater, who is of course unaware that he's a movie character.  There are some pretty good jokes early on - Slater's boss, the blustery Lt Dekker (Frank McRae) gets so angry and abusive if his regular berating of Slater that he becomes completely incomprehensible; Slater never runs out of bullets and never hurts himself; there are cameos from several costars of Arnold's from previous films; cartoon characters work as cops; etc.  But the satire on action movie conventions is fitful and often seems to be used just to fill in the blanks between \\"real\\" action sequences, and the developing friendship between Danny and Jack, while sweet, just doesn't feel as significant as it should.  Perhaps a Spielberg would have made it too shmaltzy, but here you're left wondering just how Danny really feels about the whole experience once it's over.<br /><br />Charles Dance does a great one-eyed villain (with a different glass eye for every occasion) and Tom Noonan plays the other villain, something of a slasher-movie type monster called \\"Ripper\\".  Anthony Quinn is around as a bit as Dance's employer who stupidly keeps making idiomatic malapropisms in the manner of Biff in Back to the Future; we know his minutes are numbered from the get-go.  Art Carney has a nice little cameo as Slater's \\"favorite second cousin\\" and Bridgette Wilson is there to lend someserious hotness.  There are some nice little specific movie references - Olivier's Hamlet transformed into Jack Slater's (\\"to be, or not to be...not to be\\" as he blows up the castle behind him) and Ian McKellen doing Bergman's death - but overall the satire is outweighed by action setpieces, and the film has a rather slapped-together feel to it, unsure as to what to do other than lumber towards a big splashy finish.<br /><br />Still, it's mostly fun, and I have to say that I wasn't as bothered by O'Brien as I was on seeing it when new.  I think Arnie was fairly into it also, and that's important.  Probably average for his ouevre, and for all it's faults, another reminder as to why he really was not just the biggest but the best American action star of his era: he had the best talent around him, and he rarely seemed to take his image as seriously as people like Seagal, Stallone and Norris did.are some nice little specific movie references - Olivier's Hamlet transformed into Jack Slater's (\\"to be, or not to be...not to be\\" as he blows up the castle behind him) and Ian McKellen doing Bergman's death - but overall the satire is outweighed by action setpieces, and the film has a rather slapped-together feel to it, unsure as to what to do other than lumber towards a big splashy finish.
